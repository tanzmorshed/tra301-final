","""I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time"", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use ""the weapon"".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10"

","As the climax of the movie wanes and you slowly begin to realize the true meaning of this film, you can't help but feel overwhelmed and ask yourself, ""what if I got another chance at life?""<br/><br/>It is not a sci-fi film. This is a true love story. Not a romance, but as the Greek call it, Agape. The highest form of love. She knows how her story ends, but she chooses to relive her fate.<br/><br/>I don't really want to give anything critical away here because this movie needs to be watched, and it needs to be felt. Anyone who has had pain, disappointments, or regrets, needs to watch this movie for its beautiful message, and enjoy it for what it is- a well made movie that is unique and beautiful in every way, something sorely lacking in Hollywood these days.<br/><br/>One note: Max Richter's ""On The Nature of Daylight"" was perfectly utilized in this film, I truly do not think the moment it was used would not be as impactful if not for this beautiful song. The end was definitely the highlight of the film, and when you hear the faint, weeping strings come in, it's almost automatic, you begin to feel like the events that are unfolding are happening to you. Truly a remarkable film in every way."
"SilentEyes_","9","513","656","13 February 2017"," No CGI overkill, just some fine acting and directing
","Denis Villeneuve is without a doubt an upcoming director and I can't wait to see Blade Runner 2049. Prisoners, Sicario and now Arrival (haven't seen Enemy yet, or some of his earlier work). Denis knows how to capture the tension. It is almost the strongest point of all of his films. Minimal use of computer generated images, and main focus on story, characters, acting and thrilling scenes. Back on IMDb board, I have noticed a lot of people calling Arrival a boring movie. So many hypocrites these days. People trying to point out every possible flaw to look and sound smarter while at the same time hailing far worse movies. Calling it boring and slow while at the same time complaining no originality in Hollywood, only giant CGI laser explosions extravaganza. Go watch Independence Day. In Arrival there is no action, no explosions, just some amazing acting performances combined with good directing, editing and cinematography. There was not a single moment I felt bored."

","As a kid, my dad used to tell me stories at night just like any other dads out there. I grew up, got busy with life but those priceless timeless beautiful storytelling moments that I once shared, that amazed me in wonder, curiosity, imagination and desire to know more..<br/><br/>I know if I think hard enough I might remember some of them, but that's not the point. The point is all those stories had characters and people and objects and places and things that I could either imagine or something that I could picture and understand and visualize in my young mind. If not for those imaginable characters and people, I would have never understood those stories, the true meaning of the story, the actual story behind the story that my dad probably wanted me to understand.<br/><br/>Arrival, for me is such a story. Aliens are just fun characters that help me understand the story so I can actually see beyond it and understand the untold story. You see, the way I understand it is that the director had to dumb it down for us and wrap this movie in a sci-fi genre and add aliens so you could relate it to something you are familiar with and hoped, really hoped that we try to understand the true purpose, the message behind all this. It simply couldn't have been portrayed better than this!<br/><br/>This movie teaches you a lot of things, if you are ready to learn. About 'time' and how much we are bound by it, about life and death, about loving unconditionally, about believing in yourself that everything happens for a reason, and so much more.."
"ryanjmorris","10","1367","2062","11 October 2016"," A flat out, stone cold, science fiction masterpiece
","Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a linguist who teaches at a College. One day, twelve giant spacecrafts appear in random locations across the world overnight. Louise's skills make her a requirement for the U.S forces, who recruit her - and mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) - to attempt to decode and translate the language that the creatures inside the spacecrafts are using in order to prevent a global war. Alien invasion films have, frankly, been done to death. Arrival's script - penned by Eric Heisserer and adapted from Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of Your Life"" - is ingenious in that it finds an entirely new angle to focus the whole thing on. Rather than start a war and depict the bloodshed and trauma of an alien invasion, Arrival focuses on the struggle to communicate with the creatures (dubbed ""Heptapods""), and what the aftermath of this could lead to should it not go to plan. The whole thing is pieced together like a piece of art - the performances, dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack, screenplay, editing and direction all form one elegantly structured whole. It's a simply astonishing feat of film making.<br/><br/>Arrival finds strength in just about everything it is comprised of. It does this to such an extent, in fact, that it's almost impossible to break it down into individual pieces. Amy Adams is superb here, giving a subdued but deeply moving performance. A lot of the film rests on her shoulders for its twists and turns to stick the landing, but she carries it without breaking a sweat. Never given any big Oscar-esque moments, Adams tells Louise's story in her softest moments and through her body language. It's an astoundingly delicate performance. Renner is also solid, and accompanies Adams nicely, even if he can't help but feel woefully overshadowed. Louise as a character is the film's most exciting element - a woman that uses her knowledge and skills to change the world in ways it has never been changed before, all of which comes down to language. When Arrival ends, you will spend hours thinking about yourself and the language you speak and use every day. The potential behind this story was astronomical, and it delivers in spades.<br/><br/>Much like in his previous film Sicario, Villeneuve has created a masterful aesthetic in every way. The film's soundtrack, courtesy of the terrific Jóhann Jóhannsson, is a sublime array of thumping horn arrangements and softer pieces. The cinematography (by Bradford Young) is breathtaking, bringing in references and odes to other sci-fi classics (notably 2001: A Space Oddysey) but successfully acting as a perfect match to the tone of each sequence. The flashback sequences focused on Louise's young daughter look and feel like forgotten memories, while the moments inside the spacecrafts feel entirely alien. The production design is stunning, the large pitch black objects hovering over the cities feel instantly dark and foreboding, and the brief sights of the creatures we're given reveal something wholly original. In terms of technicalities and aesthetic, Arrival is a thing of beauty - a unique, visually resplendent film that you never want to take your eyes off of.<br/><br/>But where Arrival hits perfection, though? The emotion. The power behind the story, and the direction the story takes in its tremendous final act. This is what makes Arrival such a phenomenal film. It sets up a story (an already thought-provoking and well paced one, at that), and then smoothly transforms into something much bigger than you could ever have expected it to be. Another stroke of ingeniousness is that the film doesn't do this in one movement. Rather than drop one bombshell and change its direction, Arrival slowly sets up a series of events, then puts them in motion one by one, binding everything neatly around its central character. Y'know that feeling you get when an absolutely killer plot twist lands? Arrival will give you that feeling for the entirety of its final act. It is, of course, entirely possible to work out where it is headed. I did, as a matter of fact, and it just made the whole thing feel that little bit more special. You either work it out and watch as it comes to life before your eyes, or you cluelessly dedicate your time to its finale and feel mesmerised at each and every turn. Whichever you experience, it is wonderful.<br/><br/>Arrival is a film that feels thrilling in its own unique little way. When it ends, and you discuss it for hours (which is inevitable), you'll find yourself not focusing on the aliens. You'll be focusing on the emotional power of it all, on the human side of the story. I've deliberately left a lot out of this review, just to avoid spoiling the direction the film takes in its final act. The power behind the constant twists and turns is game changing; it proves that science fiction can be, despite what the name might imply, the most human genre to make a film about. Arrival has some stunning imagery and effects to play around with, but instead it focuses on language and conversation. It focuses on humanity and time and memory, and all that is worth fighting for on this planet. It is a breathtaking achievement, and one I already cannot wait to experience countless times again. In a year riddled with emotionless superhero films and crude comedies, Arrival is a godsend. Villeneuve has been on the verge of a masterpiece for the last few years, and he has finally landed it. Arrival is a film for the ages. Seek it out at all costs, and let it transport you across time and space only to bring you back down to Earth, evoking a feeling you may never have experienced before. This, people, this right here is why I adore cinema."
"bob-the-movie-man","10","373","550","8 November 2016"," Wow - what a surprise
","Sometimes I can get very irritated by a trailer for giving too much away (case in point, ""Room"" and more recently ""Passengers""). Sometimes I can get very excited by a really good teaser trailer (case in point, ""10 Cloverfield Lane""). But most of the time a ""ho hum"" trailer typically drives the expectation of a ""ho hum"" film: ""Jack Reacher: Never Look Back"" being a good recent example. Then there is ""Arrival""<br/><br/>Because the trailer for ""Arrival"" belies absolutely nothing about the depth and complexity of the film. At face value, it looks like a dubious ""Close Encounters"" wannabe, with a threat of movement towards the likes of ""Independence Day"" and ""The 5th Wave"". Actually what you get is a film that approaches the grandeur of ""Close Encounters"" but interlaces it with the intellectual depth of ""Inception"", the mystery of ""Intersteller"" and a heavy emotional jolt or two of ""Up"".<br/><br/>Amy Adams (""Batman vs Superman"") plays Dr Louise Banks, a language teacher at a US university facing a bunch of particularly disengaged students one morning. For good reason since world news is afoot. Twelve alien craft have positioned themselves strategically around the world, hanging a few feet from the ground in just the sort of way that bricks don't. Banks is approached by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) and offered the job of trying to communicate with the aliens: where did they come from? why are they here? Banks faces the biggest challenge of her academic career in trying to devise a strategy for communication without any foundation of knowledge on what level communication even works at for them. Assisted by Ian Donelly (Jeremy Renner, ""Mission Impossible IV/V"", ""Avengers""), a theoretical physicist, the pair try to crack the code against a deadline set by the inexorable rise of international tensions – driven by China's General Chang (Tzi Ma, ""Veep""; ""24"").<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg made a rare error of judgement by adding scenes in his ""Special Edition"" of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" showing everyman power guy Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) entering the alien spacecraft. Some things are best left to the imagination. Here, a reprise of that mistake seems inevitable, but – perversely – seems to be pulled off with mastery and aplomb. The aliens are well rendered, and the small scale nature of the set (I'm sure I've been in similar dingy waiting rooms in UK railway stations!) is cleverly handled by the environmental conditions. <br/><br/>But where the screenplay really kills it is in the emergence of the real power unleashed by the translation work. To say any more would deliver spoilers, which I won't do. But this is a masterly piece of science- fiction writing. The screenplay was by Eric Heisserer – someone with a limited scriptwriting CV of horror film reboots/sequels such as ""Final Destination 5"", ""The Thing"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" – so the portents were not good, which just adds to the surprise. If I were to be critical, some of the dialogue at times is a little TOO clever for its own good and smacks of Aaron Sorkin over-exposition: the comment about ""They have a word for it in Hungary"" for example went right over my head.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve (""Sicario"") deftly directs, leaving the pace of the story glacially slow in places to let the audience deduce what is going on at their own speed. This will NOT be to the liking of movie fans who like their films in a wham-bam of CGI, but was very much to my liking. The film in fact has very little exposition, giving you lots to think about after the credits roll: there were elements of the story (such as her book) that still generated debate with my better half on the drive home.<br/><br/>Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are first rate and an effectively moody score by Jóhann Jóhannsson (""Sicario""; ""The Theory of Everything"") round off the other high-point credits for me.<br/><br/>An extraordinary film, this is a must see for sci-fi fans but also for lovers of good cinema and well-crafted stories.<br/><br/>(Agree?

"cdjh-81125","10","151","230","5 January 2017"," Not A Masterpiece, An Achievement
","Arrival was one of my most anticipated movies of 2016 I loved all the trailers for this film and the talent behind it made me even more excited to see the final product and I can safely say that I was blown away by the final product. This is a slow burning, thought provoking and incredibly intriguing Sci Fi masterpiece that I think in future years will become a classic. Amy Adams gives one of the greatest performances of her entire career in this film, she perfect embodies someone who is determined in her pursuit but damaged by her experiences and it's a performance that will hopefully give her an Oscar. Jeremy Renner was just perfect casting for this film he was incredibly convincing in this film and his chemistry with Adams was fantastic. Forrest Whitaker was great in this film and it was nice to see a different type of role from him. The slow pacing of this film worked perfectly it helped to build up the slow burning suspense and gave the characters more time to be developed better. The special effects in this film are also fantastic mainly because they are used sparingly as it is clear that the focus is more on the characters. Denis Villeneuve did such an amazing job directing this film he really sucked you into the situation and made it seem more life like. This film asks a lot of questions about humanity and how it interacts and these questions are incredibly intriguing and thought provoking it forces the audience to think on real life and accurate the events of this film are to real life. The whole mystery of why the aliens are here is done perfectly you're more that likely to change your mind at least once and when a mystery like that is built up for so long it's hard to make the eventual discovery satisfying but in this case it was, the eventual reveal makes you look at this film in an entirely different way, the film also doesn't feel the need to answer every question it asks leaving certain things ambiguous that allows the viewer to think on their own answers. <br/><br/>Arrival is a film that trusts the intelligence and patience of its audience, it is complex and thought provoking but is never boring or dull. This is not only the greatest film of 2016 but it's possibly one of the greatest I've ever seen. I truly believe that in the future this film will become a classic. <br/><br/>100%/A+"
"ikjirstin","10","491","857","14 October 2016"," ARRIVAL: The Best Sci-fi Film Since CONTACT
","ARRIVAL delivers on so many levels it's impossible to describe without spoilers. The book is out there, so if you really must know before you see a film, read, ""The Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang...but I highly recommend you see the movie first. Honestly. You want it to unfold as a warm, fresh croissant on a chilly morning, and melt in your mouth.<br/><br/>From visually stimulating scenes to an unexpected score masterfully composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson you recognize at once this is a thinking film you'll long remember. <br/><br/>One scene in particular features a cloud that took my breath away. Sure, the extraterrestrial vehicle was amazing, but that cloud... As a photojournalist of nearly fifty years, I was stunned at the lifelike character of the cloud and suspected it was real, though I knew that was impossible; you can't cue Mother Nature when it's time to roll. I wanted to praise the CGI team for the effect, but Shawn Levy confirmed it was natural. They had set up to shoot this wide shot, worried about impending rain, or too much wind, or the lighting being too dark for the right effect, but the cloud wanted to become a star that day, and it rolled into frame with absolute perfection. This scene alone is worth a nod to Bradford Young for best cinematography.<br/><br/>The special effects team delivered, too. <br/><br/>Amy Adams performance was stunning. Sci-fi is largely disregarded when awards are passed out, but if the Academy neglects to acknowledge Adams work in this film, I may boycott them forever. Adams is Oscar-worthy for a Best Actress nomination for her character of linguist Dr. Louise Banks in this one, though Meryl Streep will most likely take it for Florence Foster Jenkins. <br/><br/>It is clear the five years taken to bring this story to the screen were well worth the work. <br/><br/>Ten well-deserved stars for ARRIVAL. I wish it a huge success at the box office so this team will continue to make more films of this caliber."
"CalRhys","Null","366","643","21 November 2016"," Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus!
","Prior to approaching this film, a word of warning that it is what many like to call a ""thinking person's sci-fi"". If you're going to watch this, I beg that you dedicate your utmost attention to it, as it is truly one rewarding experience, one of the smartest, most well-constructed science fiction marvels of recent years. 'Arrival' is Villeneuve's magnum opus.<br/><br/>Firstly, to put your mind at ease, I won't be analysing the plot, thus avoiding the use of spoilers. This decade, Villeneuve has crafted some fantastic works of art in the form of 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and now this science fiction gem, and here's hoping his career further develops with more movie masterpieces coming our way. In a world where mysteries remain and the possibility of extraterrestrial life still stands unanswered, 'Arrival' approaches this with it's cliché-free take on the genre.<br/><br/>The relatively unknown Bradford Young provides the film with some of the most stunning cinematography ever conceived, taking advantage of the twilight hour to give the film its somewhat unique look, supported magnificently by Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson whose score is both haunting and beautiful. If you're someone looking for a science-fiction tale that keeps you guessing and thinking throughout, with fantastic performances, cinematography, music and near-flawless direction, then 'Arrival' is the film for you. The masterpiece of 2016!"
"laabstract","10","644","1155","15 September 2016"," A film that not only tests the idea of aliens, but of humanity.
","Are we alone? This question has haunted mankind since they first gazed at the stars. ""Arrival"" answers this question with an abrupt no. Other films have tackled the question of humanity being alone in the cosmos, from classics like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953) ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) ""Arrival"" deals with the idea of alien landings in a much different way than traditional Sci-Fi films. While the picture focuses on creatures from another planet, it still has the uncanny ability to question our own humanity. <br/><br/>Although ""Arrival"" is set up like many other Sci-Fi films with a doctor being needed by the government to do some top secret work to save human kind, it is not a traditional Sci-Fi film. Being Denis Villeneuve's first leap into the Sci-Fi genre ""Arrival"" is a story of self-reflection which is helped along by an alien presence. For no particular reason 12 alien ships land all over the planet in seemingly random locations. The only true form of communication takes place from a single opening in the bottom of the alien vessel, where Linguist Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked at trying to open up dialog with the visitors. Physicist Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) is tasked with finding out how the alien vessel is capable of travel through space and how it seemingly defies gravity. The real question however remains in not how the aliens got to earth, but why? <br/><br/>What sets this film apart from others in the genre is the way that it plays with the notion of time, love and the essence of being human. Which is showcased in director Denis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer's effortless ability to jump from time and place. While trying to discover what the Aliens are, and their motivation, Dr. Louise Banks discovers what makes herself human and questions everything held sacred to her. ""Arrival"" is just as much a film about aliens landing on earth, as a film about self-discovery and the value placed on love and loss. Dr. Banks although participating in some of the most ground breaking work a linguist could ever be involved in, is haunted by the tragic loss of her daughter. This coupling of discovery and loss is reflected perfectly in the acting performance of Amy Adams who is often torn between several emotions throughout the film. <br/><br/>Just as in his previous movies ""Sicario"" (2015) and ""Prisoners"" (2013) Denis Villeneuve employed composer Jóhann Jóhannsson who created an eerie and often unsettling composition for ""Arrival"". The sound pairs perfectly with the strange other worldly images of the aliens and their craft, the composition adds another layer of complexity to the already foreign and creepy world that is the alien craft. Visually the film is fantastic with an expert play on light and dark imagery, and the very deliberate use of color to emphasize certain characters and events. This transfers into the shadowy and smoke filled environment inside the alien vessel as well as the ink like Rorschach style alien writing. The visual effects used in Arrival give a sense of other worldly presence making the ship look as if it were a great technical feat of some unknown civilization, yet at the same time look organic as if were merely plucked from the surface of some far off planet. The aliens themselves look as if acquired from a Guillermo del Toro set, they are octopus like with long tentacle arms and gunmetal gray coloration, which begs the question of how a creature like this could have the dexterity to craft a sophisticated vehicle. <br/><br/>The film comes together to create a package of visual, intellectual and audible bliss. The composition of Jóhann Jóhannsson is second to none and at times the sound plays a critical character in the film. The cast with inclusion of Michael Stuhlbarg and Forest Whitaker (2 actors not really know for Sci-Fi) was a welcome addition. The dynamic between Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner seemed organic and a hallmark of great acting. But the stand out performance was that of Amy Adams who played a truly troubled and conflicted character.<br/><br/>In ""Sicario"" Vileneuve finished the movie with unanswered questions and left a lot to the imagination. In ""Arrival"" the film ended with a perfectly packaged ending that felt too neat and tidy. The film went into some sophisticated ideas that dived into the essence of humanity, yet did not give the same license for abstract thought with the conclusion. Ultimately Arrival is not just an exploration of alien beings, it's an exploration at what makes us human, and the positive and negative aspects that are associated with that humanity."

","To this reviewer, there are two kinds of sci fi.<br/><br/>The common type dates back to Buck Rogers and has more modern iterations in Star Trek and Star Wars. Action and mayhem.<br/><br/>The other type, the ""smart"" or intellectual type, is harder to classify. It has been around forever but appears and disappears randomly. Consider the DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951/2008) or CUBE (1997) or the more recent MARTIAN (2015).<br/><br/>The second type is an oddity because most of the heavy lifting takes place in your brain, not on the screen.<br/><br/>I consider ARRIVAL the best example of the ""Smart"" genre ever done.<br/><br/>These films, because they are so subjective, require a central character that the viewer can identify with. Ms. Adams deserves special merit for picking this film up and carrying it to the finish line.<br/><br/>A must see, for fans of ""smart"" scifi."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","9","665","1217","13 September 2016"," The Arrival of a mind-blowing sci-fi masterpiece
","Last night I saw Arrival at TIFF and my mind was blown. This is by far Villeneuve's biggest film he has tackled yet with so many strong universal themes but yet also feels very emotional and intimate from the perspective of Amy Adams's character.<br/><br/>Unlike Villeneuve's previous works like Prisoners and Sicario, Arrival isn't a dark or twisted look at humanity. Instead, Villeneuve chooses to go for a lighter yet still serious tone with the mystery surrounding the arrival of the aliens. That is what makes Arrival so incredible. Villeneuve injects elements from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 to make the story not only visual stunning but also makes it very captivating. Arrival does not rely on conflict between the humans and aliens to keep you invested and entertained because Arrival is against that trope. Each time our characters interact with the aliens, who remain covered in mist for most of the screen time, we as the audience gain something new in the form of knowledge and discovery rather then an action set piece. And when we return back to the outside world, we see through the media how each discovery affects it in different ways. <br/><br/>The characters are one of the reasons why this film works. They are not treated as cliché plot devices but are just real people who just want answers to this situation. Amy Adams truly is the star of this film as she carries this film with a sense of gravitas but also vulnerability. She shows a woman who is at first terrified from meeting the newly arrived aliens but gains strength when she learns more. Flashbacks to a tragic event also reveal the struggle she goes through especially as the fate of the world is on her shoulders. Jeremy Renner does a good job as a physicist with a dry sense of humor. Forest Whittaker is also great a the general who isn't a trigger-happy idiot but someone whose job is just to get answers in order to find the safest and most humane solution possible.<br/><br/>Arrival is a film that is more then just about language. It shows how divided we are as a species as each nation and culture interprets the alien's language in different meanings. And from this lack of clear understanding it creates fear and paranoia that could lead to global war. But Arrival shows that despite the mystery that surrounds the unknown, the future can be just as hopeful and bright as it might be scary and we should approach it with confidence.<br/><br/>This has proved Denise Villeneuve has range in genre as a director. I look forward to seeing him continue his work in the sci fi genre with Blade Runner 2."
"bartonj2410","10","315","563","15 October 2016"," This generation's Close Encounters of the Third Kind
","The mystery of the unknown is something that doesn't get explored enough within science fiction. Too often we see science fiction films, particularly involving aliens, that are only interested with how we, as a species, would fight back against them.<br/><br/>Every now and then however, we get a film like Denis Villeneuve's Arrival that comes along and offers something totally different. The film uses its tagline ""Why are they here?"" quite literally to deliver one of the most fascinating films you will see all year.<br/><br/>Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is one of the world's leading linguists, who gets recruited by the military to assist in translating alien communications. Along with mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Louise attempts to get answers as to why twelve alien spacecrafts have landed at different locations around the world.<br/><br/>I had only seen three of Denis Villeneuve's previous films before yet I have been impressed with the diversity of his films, a trend he continues with Arrival. What I really admire about Villeneuve as a filmmaker is the choice he makes to not spoon feed the audience with every single piece of information. He instead makes films to challenge the audience, leaving them to either complete the puzzle themselves or question the morality of his characters.<br/><br/>With Arrival, Villeneuve has crafted a truly thought provoking science fiction film, telling the story in a slow yet masterful manner, leading to a beautiful pay off. The theme of communication resonates massively with the world today, the moment communication between twelve countries via satellite link breaks down summing it up quite suitably.<br/><br/>Villeneuve's storytelling is aided by some superb cinematography from Bradford Young and a haunting score from Jóhann Jóhannsson. Young's cinematography captures the sense of wonder perfectly while Jóhannsson's score heightens the sense of mystery surrounding the alien visitors and their intentions.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Arrival features a real emotional heartbeat thanks to a fantastic performance from the always dependable Amy Adams, who conveys such a wide range of emotions as Louise, growing in confidence with each session she gets with the visitors. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker offer some fine support for Adams but there is no doubting this film belongs to her.<br/><br/>Arrival is one of the best films of the year and a really great example of science fiction filmmaking from Denis Villeneuve, who is perfectly suited to bring us the sequel to Blade Runner next year. I would happily put this film in the same league as something like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, one of the all time greats of sci-fi."

","First and foremost Arrival strives at providing a riveting, complex and unconventional story (written by Denis Villeneuve and Eric Heisserer) for the genre itself that brings along many intertwined elements, whilst simultaneously grounding the story in enough realism to portray it's ideology and messages effectively to communicate with the viewer. At the forefront of the film, Amy Adams as the linguist Louise Banks is incredible as it is relatable, highlighting her already seen talent in her possible career best performance.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and audio are masterful, with the use of diegetic and non-diegetic sound providing much of the atmosphere and ambiguity in the film. The soundtrack and sound design entangle in an almost grey area that leaves the viewer wondering the source of what they're listening to, ultimately making the Aliens feel more real and alive as a result. Moreover, the orchestral pieces spread out across the film provide the viewer with an emotional touch for Louis and her experiences throughout the film, bringing the viewer closer to the character and to the contemplative nature of the film and it's broader themes of time and memory.<br/><br/>Finally the cinematography (completed by Bradford Young) is alluring and magnificent, and paints the picture of the scenes within the film beautifully and elegantly with awareness of contributing to building the world, characters and story. Young's masterful approach elevates the story with newfound emotion, typically with the shots of Louise contemplating the mortality of her own daughter Hannah. Furthermore, Young's impressive genius at portraying this world through a lens continues with the use of softness and distinction within the lines and the characters of the film. This creates the notion or notion of a portrait within the movie, that of which the characters and their memories are painted on. Ultimately, this is one of my personal favourite examples of cinematography within a film and one example that I will always bring up when asked about expertly curated cinematography.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Arrival is a timeless piece of stunning and brilliant cinema that is relatable and heartfelt with its themes of how we communicate and are bonded together by our own memories and past, and the effect that can have in the span of our lives."

","Being a linguist myself and a great sci-fi aficionado, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing cinematic gem. It has absolutely everything I could want in a smart and thought provoking sci-fi movie. It had me at the first several seconds - it gripped my attention from the get go and never let up. Music and the actor played a great part in this, but the story itself is what's really amazing. So simple, yet so complex. I definitely didn't expect the time component but caught on relatively quickly. Definite recommendation for people who are not brainless sheep used to Hollywood crash-boom-bang kind of sci fi. This is a meditative experience about human nature and its indestructible spirit. Tell all your friends about it."
"nemoe","9","340","636","7 October 2016"," An extraordinary film.
","I saw this last night at the opening of the Mill Valley film Festival. Arrival is unlike any movie I've ever seen. It's about love, loss, tolerance, language and non-linear time, wrapped in a science fiction story about our first encounter with extraterrestrials. <br/><br/>Under director Denis Villeneuve's masterful direction, Arrival takes its time to unfold, but it gradually gets under your skin and commands your attention. The last half hour was one of the most emotional experiences I've had at the movies in a long time. There aren't many movies these days that I would call required viewing, but this is one of them. And Amy Adams is Oscar-worthy in the lead role. In fact, Arrival could also win Oscars for original score, sound, direction and Best Picture."

","This movie left everybody in the cinema clueless and bored to death.<br/><br/>So many things in the movie make ZERO sense, just a few examples:<br/><br/><ul><li>The colonel expects the linguist to decipher some alien language that sounds like gwowodkgjdkgrowlhwkas on the spot from a dicta phone.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Most important event in humankind and all decisions are taken by some random soldiers in the camp. President of the US or any politicians are never shown and take no role whatsoever in the story.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some ""rogue"" soldier (god knows how) gets his hands on explosives, avoids all controls, and expects to destroy with a few C4 charges a huge spaceship which defies the laws of physics.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The way they ""decipher"" the alien random scrabbling are just completely arbitrary and laughable (aka there is no explanation on how anything is deciphered) but magically after a few months they have a full vocabulary with which they can have a conversation. In real history many real human languages based on actual letters (not random stains in the air) were a completely unintelligible until the Rosetta Stone was found with a key to understand them.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The alien presence on earth is just nonsensical. They arrive, say that they have bought some ""gift"" to humanity because in 3000 years they will need help in return (for what?) and then they disappear in thin air without having accomplished anything.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The attack by the Chinese general (again, no government exists, it seems that soldier can just do what the heck the want) is stopped by some phone call whose contents nobody bothers to explain.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>most of the movie is just going back and forth from the ship, zzzzzzzzzz</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The physicist is practically useless.

","The aliens have arrived. And they are – Holy Calamari People, Batman! – giant squid. The giant squid communicate in writing by shooting magical retractable ink out of their tentacles onto a transparent wall. It's up to linguist Amy Adams to decipher their communication before the other crazy countries in the world try to blow up everything.<br/><br/>The Calamari People, who float in a room of steam, write in circles – which is apparently how they experience time. Without a beginning or end. They can see their lives in their entirety. And the Calamari People are here to give humanity a gift, we find out: Once you unlock their language and become fluent, you will experience time in the circular way they do. It's a lot like becoming fluent in French and suddenly realizing why the French love Jerry Lewis so much.<br/><br/>From the lack of character and character development to the way the story unfolds, the movie is like watching a real-time long shot of a grave digger digging a grave on the grayest of all days. It's morose and filled with dread. Monotone and monotonous. Shovel after shovel after shovel, and he never seems like he is getting anywhere.<br/><br/>The entire pic is filled with ""music"" that is just a bunch of low hums that underscore the dread and monotone. It doesn't give us a clue to how we should be feeling. And that's why I go to the movies, to feel. How about awe at seeing the spaceships? The joy and celebration of the first breakthrough of communication? Nope, we get tedium and low bassy hums.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner plays a physicist who doesn't do any physics, and he nicknames the two Calamari People we see Abbott & Costello. Although you can't tell them apart, Abbott becomes my favorite character in the movie because he gets to die midway through and doesn't have to suffer through the rest of the film. Lucky Abbott. <br/><br/>Throw in voiceovers and flashbacks that we find out are really flashforwards because time is actually circular to Amy Adams, and you have a film that yearns to be so much more than the real-time gravedigging than it is. It's the type of intellectual pretentiousness I thought only the Nolans could put on the screen."
"martin-807-452270","1","820","1593","10 November 2016"," so close but so far.
","This should have been brilliant!<br/><br/>****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>I love Amy Adams and think she is a great actress, and the first half of this films is suitably spooky, fully of mystery - but as soon as she gets in to the alien space ship and starts writing her name LOUISE, I just shook my head. Why is it so hard for Hollywood to write a decent script???<br/><br/>We spent YEARS deciding what to put on the side of the Voyager spaceship in case any sentient life forms discovered it, and used pictographs and hieroglyphics, but in this film the world's best linguist (allegedly) who knows Sanskrit (so therefore must know alien languages) just stands there and writes LOUISE in bad handwriting on a small white board and shouts her name whist enthusiastically thumping her chest!<br/><br/>That is how the English behave abroad, not how you make first contact with an alien race.<br/><br/>Close Encounters of the Third Kind did this so well with sound and colour, but here we just have a flip chart and a marker.<br/><br/>such a flippant regard for science makes all the rest of the film silly. People were laughing in the cinema when Ian started saying his name, and walking up and down 'IAN WALKS'. And then all of a sudden Lousie can recognise the word for time travel, which is a very complex concept, and all in the space of a few days.<br/><br/>Clearly the director and writer had a really great idea, and set up the world very well, but as soon at they go to the complicated bit - how do you actually communicate with an Alien from another planet who has no cultural references, then they bottled it and threw in a Voice Over from Ian, who we never quite worked out what he was there for. It's an old film making trick - if you are stuck thrown in a voice over that explains stuff.<br/><br/>They didn't even bother to try colours, or sounds, or lights, or music - just a white board and a marker and Louise has been writing in English, whilst round the world everyone will be writing in their own language and confusing the poor aliens.<br/><br/>And if you have got Forest Whittaker the Oscar winner in your film, for god's sake give him something to do! He has no purpose in this film, all his lines could be cut. Just have soldiers grab Alison and fly her to the space ship - give her the briefing in the chopper...<br/><br/>The director and writer should be forced to watch Close encounters of the third kind until they appreciate how pathetic their film becomes. <br/><br/>Such a shame. 8 out of ten for the first 30 minutes and 2 out of ten for the slow fart of the rest of the film."
"jovanakesar","10","53","91","10 December 2016"," A thought provoking masterpiece
","''Human. I am human.'' said Louise while trying to make a contact with the unknown creatures that arrived at our planet. ''Are we alone?'' This is the question that we have been asking ourselves since we discovered that we are a part of something much bigger than ourselves – Universe. It knows the answer to all of our questions. If only we weren't so disconnected and distanced and if only we chose to listen to what it has to say to us, we would feel that connection. It is there. It is always there. It always has been. Our purpose is to find a way to make a connection and synchronize our minds and souls with the universal source of wisdom that Universe is. With the eternal lullaby that has been sung to us and to our ancestors. To find out why we are here. Maybe the reason that other beings haven't visited us yet is because we are divided - divided by languages, countries... We seem to come up with more and more barriers each day and we seem to be more and more distanced from each other. The Universe itself shows us the perfect example of Unity. Look at the stars and planets. Look at the harmony and the perfect alignment, perfect order. Silent power of united giants. Maybe the reason we still haven't made the ''first contact'' is because we are not on the same frequency. The frequency of Love and Peace. Arrival goes further than any other Sci-Fi movie. It is a tangled web of different topics: time, loss, the possibility that other beings exist, role of one's purpose, the mystery of life itself... But to me, there are three main topics that are beautifully embroidered throughout the whole movie – Love, Unity and Time. Love is the only power that we need. Only love will unite us all. Love isn't limited in any way. Not even by time. Love itself conquers death and it shines into eternity. Arrival decided to change the way of alien portrayal in movies. It said no to stereotypes. Why would other beings have to be violent or use force? No. That's right. They don't. They came to present the world with the most precious gift – universal language. A language that will unite, a language that will tear down all the walls that humans built. And most importantly, it will change the way we perceive time. I enjoyed this aspect. Louise was able to establish a connection with them. She was chosen. She was given a gift to see the future. Piece by piece, until it all came together and formed a puzzle of her life. Before it even happened. What would we do if we knew every detail of our lives? Would we try to change it? Or we would enjoy it all even more and fully accept every single moment, like Louise did? This movie also shows how much it is important to persist in something. Persist until we find out the truth. Persist until it all makes sense. Be patient and not give up. Because whenever we get tangled in the threads of life, we will find a way out. We always do. One individual can change the world. Each and every one of us is a part of HERE and NOW. And starting with ourselves, we can make a big impact. I've always enjoyed Amy Adams's performances and this one was absolutely captivating. Her facial expressions deliver all the emotions and transport us there. We are standing there with her, in front of those unknown creatures, trying to make sense out of it all. We are participants, not viewers. We experience awe, confusion, fear, wonder and relief. Like Amy said herself, Louise is very intellectual and instinctual. She is a linguist that has a great capacity for empathy. She represents a female character that relies on her intuition, her brain, her instincts. Accompanied by Ian (who is a theoretical physicist), she succeeds in her mission, that was at first unknown to her. The movie was gradually unfolding, it had many layers. Each layer explored a different topic. Arrival is a spiritual journey, it deals with so much more than we could ever imagine it would. It has a heart, it speaks to its viewers, it gives hope. It's philosophical, it's enlightening. It also conveys a message that knowledge is power. It deeply touched me and it really resonated with me. It confirmed something that I already believe in. I believe that we are following the ''invisible threads'' of life, that we are being guided. Guided to make choices, resulting in what was already meant to be. It gave me a special feeling and I know I will be coming back to it over and over again."
"noahbeanslice-223-262332","9","306","591","7 September 2016"," A Science Fiction Masterpiece
","Arrival is the best sci-fi film I've seen in my 22-year-old lifespan. I haven't seen certain sci-fi films like They Live, Alien 3, or Metropolis, so I can speak only from the standpoint of someone who watches a shitload of narrative, documentary and experimental films. Some of my recent favorites are Holy Motors (2012), Son of Saul (2015), and The Look of Silence (2015).<br/><br/>I just saw Arrival two days ago at the Telluride Film Fest and everyone in the theater had their brains cheesed out at various points in the film. For people paying close attention to every frame, the rules of the film might become clear in the beginning sequences. For an Average Joe moviegoer like me, the film is a slow, natural process of discovery from the first scene to the last. The influences of Stanley Kubrick on science fiction films has been noted time after time, but Arrival picks up its Kubrick vibes with it's slow sense of discovery, even if Amy Adams and her technology moves around the screen more frantically than 2001: A Space Odyssey. That's why I respect this film and also why I like 10 Cloverfield Lane. A lot of sci-fi films (like the new Star Trek released this summer) don't create that unfolding sense of science/alien-related mystery. The way information is revealed and presented leaves us begging for more answers, and boy does Arrival deliver. <br/><br/>Oscar-worthy for sure, especially in production design/special effects/sound. Don't blow it, go see it November 11th or whenever it's coming to your town. <br/><br/>Bring earplugs.<br/><br/>Just kidding.<br/><br/>But seriously."

","I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked this up. I just knew it was a science fiction movie and as a bit of a science nerd I decided to pop it in for a watch. At this point I've seen a lot of movies, but this one was just amazing. The score is honestly gorgeous, the direction is great, the cinematography is also great. It's actually quite calm for a movie about aliens landing on earth which was again, pleasantly surprising.
My love for exobiology was big factor in why I loved the Alien design. They seem to be inspired by the aliens from The War Of The Worlds Novel (not any of the movie adaptation aliens) but I don't know for sure. <br/><br/>Of course I couldn't make a review without mentioning the best part; The plot twist. Obviously I won't spoil it as this is a non-spoiler review. 
It's been so long since I watched a movie where the plot twist was less about shocking the audience and more story based in it's execution. It felt smart but certainly was still a really cool surprise."

","Saw this at TIFF and was incredibly impressed. This movie has all the right components of an exceptional film - great cast, great director, and a great script that took a somewhat tired premise and turned out a script full of thought-provoking substance, and a highly original twist.<br/><br/>This movie's true beauty was how it masterfully balanced the plot and sub-plot throughout the entire film - to the point that the build-up to the sub-plot (which also ends up being the twist at the end) is done very subtly throughout the movie without the viewer even knowing for the most part. It's only in the last half hour that Villeneuve starts presenting it's relevance for to the viewer. However, the primary plot does not suffer, it's only enriched.<br/><br/>This movie was an exceptional combination of great story-telling and a cast and crew at the top of their game delivering an entertaining film that will have audiences talking about the questions it raises."
"nico-palou","5","190","373","8 March 2017"," Disappointing and deceptive
","I went in really wanting to like this film since I love sci-fi and i'm interested in philosophy of language. However, I was disappointed, mainly because it fails at its own game: the science is ridiculous, and so is its cheesy and simplistic anti-war message. The scene where the colonel first approaches the protagonist Louise Banks at her office was incredibly stupid and badly written: <br/><br/>Colonel: (out of the blue) It's been only two days <br/><br/>Louise: (confused)... <br/><br/>C: People are already demanding answers. Here, listen to this *plays audio recorder*<br/><br/>L: (still confused) <br/><br/>C: Well? Come on! What are they saying? <br/><br/>L: I'd have to be there; I can't translate from this. <br/><br/>C: You did it back then with Farsi insurgents!! <br/><br/>L: That's because I already knew the language (Duh!) <br/><br/>C: Ooohh, I see what you're trying to do here you sly girl... it's not gonna happen, this is not a negotiation!! (storms out) <br/><br/>WTF!<br/><br/>And then they land a helicopter in her backyard to pick her up (so over the top!) after they find out that the second ""expert"" on their list gives an ""incorrect"" answer to a question that doesn't make sense: ""what's the Sanskrit word for 'war' and its translation?"" Isn't that asking the same thing twice? In any case, this was a clumsy way of introducing the theme of miscommunication. Apparently this Berkeley scholar was not aware that a word can have different meanings in different contexts/uses.<br/><br/>Louise is the only real character in this film; they decided to make everyone stupid and hollow just so she could look smart and layered. She's written to be more a translator between two known languages than a linguist. They really didn't know how to show a true linguist at work, so they decided to skim through the whole deciphering process by means of a montage rather than showing her actual process, which would have been far more interesting. You could say this is a film that only features sci-fi elements as a backdrop for a drama. Well, they should have advertised it as what it is! <br/><br/>Renner' character doesn't behave like a scientist, he's quite ignorant and shallow (but we're supposed to think he's smart because he scribbled some unintelligible stuff on the whiteboard). The only contribution he makes is incredibly contrived and unnecessary. He's there for two reasons: 1) to give presence to natural science, providing a counterpoint to Louise who represents the social sciences, 2) a plot device for the twist ending/love interest (by the way, who bought them falling in love? Nothing throughout the movie hints at a developing relationship. The ending was so cheesy).<br/><br/>Then the military is a bag of clichés: stupid, impatient, and reckless. And since when a colonel and a general make all the political decisions? The whole ""let's unite and cooperate"" message falls flat because it was so unrealistic. The right-wing nut-jobs sub-plot felt rushed and unnecessary. It's like they're trying too hard to take a political stance against everything that Trump represents, but it comes off really heavy-handed.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to bother with time ""travel"" paradoxes and contradictions about the presence/absence of free will, because I get that this is sci-fi and the plot is supposed to serve a greater message, in this case, the moral question that Nietzsche famously once posed:<br/><br/>""What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sight and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence' [] If this thought gained possession of you, it would change you as you are or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing: 'Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?' would lie upon your actions as the heaviest weight. Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?""<br/><br/>There were far better ways of exploring this question. <br/><br/>As for the cinematography, it was unnecessarily bleak, and the only memorable piece of the score is not even original; it was written by Max Richter years ago for another film and recycled here."

And that's it. You would think that if she was successful there would be huge implications and if she was not successful there would also be huge implications. In the end, there were no implications - she wrote a book. And the book had no impact on the world either. The end.<br/><br/>This is why I'm such a happy Netflix customer. I can give the movie half an hour to get going and when I realize that it's going to be a stinker (aka Fury) I can stop it and move on to something else. In this case, I was trapped in a sold out theatre. When it was done everyone just quietly filed out.

","Here is the first spoiler, you will never get back the time you waste by watching this movie. The story line is based on a linguistics professor being recruited to communicate with, ahhh well...squid...over sized face huggers...who knows and even more importantly who really cares? The creature design is uninteresting and done to death. The ships the squid arrive in are...can you guess it? If you were thinking giant pebble...you are absolutely right. If not and were expecting inspired ships designs...sorry...nil points. The film tries to be cleaver by lots and lots of random cut scenes combined with a weak story line and characters which fails to connect with the audience. The language used by the aliens in my opinion would take years to decode and the antagonist of the movie manages to crack a written language based on circles in mere months. There is a real lack of explanation as to the motives of some of secondary characters, as a rouge team of military personnel attempt to blow up one of the 12 giant pebbles. Why? Surely they can't expect us to believe that a YouTube clip motivated them to possibly doom all of humanity? The movie is boring. You can feel every minute slowly tick by. As your brain is assaulted by a million random cut scenes of babies, people passing away and other mundane rubbish, you wish you were in front of a freshly painted wall watching the paint dry. <br/><br/>That's not all! When you get to the actual stage that you wish that real aliens would just blast you with a ray gun to end the misery of watching Arrival...it ends. It's not a joyous occasion, I mean yes you are thankful the film has ended but it plummets even further into dire and mediocre pit of misery and despair. It is finally ascertained that the squid have a tool or gift for humanity. Upon the discovery that the squid will do us a favour and will return in a mere 3000 years to ask for our help in return. This is the best bit...oh sweet lord...the squid and their giant pebbles dissolve like fizzy tablets. They give us nothing...and to be honest most of us will be dead in 3000 years...so we'll worry about that when we get to it. The main protagonist is then seduced by a smooth talking scientist who breaks the ice by saying ""Wanna make a baby?"". You try that...please. Go up to a lady you fancy in a location of your choosing and blurt out the immortal words ""Wanna make a baby?"". She will either have you arrested or will destroy you were you stand. Either way I wouldn't consider it solid dating advice.<br/><br/>I would like to conclude by saying please listen to my mad ramblings and don't watch this movie. If like me, you enjoy Sci-Fi there are dozens of better films out there. Arrival is not original, the story line is weak, the monsters are dire and their ships are dreadful. I am a massive Forest Whittaker fan and the man is still a legend. Only two questions I would like to ask him...Why did you choose to be in arrival? & when is Blood Sports 2 going to be made?"

"michaelsharples96","10","56","106","1 November 2016"," Denis Villeneuve continues his streak of excellence with a Sci-Fi that is sure to be thought of as a masterpiece for many years to come.
","Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is Science Fiction at it's absolute deepest and most profound. It's a thinking mans film that forces you to find your own interpretations. Sure to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Blade Runner, Children of Men and maybe even 2001: A Space Odyssey (a bit of a stretch) in the many years to come. The French-Canadian director has crafted what is likely to be the best film he will ever make.<br/><br/>Arrival does more than just provoke thought. It invites question, it craves understanding and most importantly it deserves dissecting, hopefully from someone who is a much smarter writer than I. I think the most interesting thing about this film is how it approaches the alien species. It's not your typical ""take over the world"" fiasco climaxing in an action packed third act. It's a slow, mesmerising film focusing on the comprehending of language as a barrier of communication between different beings.<br/><br/>There are many themes present throughout the film in which all leave you pondering the relativity to human life. There's the fear of the unknown and the overcoming of powerlessness. The importance of family and the meaning it brings. The questioning of existence within the vast scope of the universe. The misunderstanding of time and relativity. The retaliation of world leaders through misinterpretation of situations, in such a scenario we would be first to act before truly grasping the purpose of an alien species, we would automatically assume annihilation. Just as we do in real world predicaments.<br/><br/>Instead what Arrival does is completely flip the notion on it's head. Not coming to us through means of destruction but through means of aid. There's much to the species left to be unveiled, their appearance stands out above anything we have seen before. Although it is minutely brought up their purpose is never truly explained leaving ambiguity and comprehension.<br/><br/>Perhaps the strongest aspect here is how Amy Adams' own personal story unfolds within the narrative. Films that start with the ending are usually predictable in their execution due to the fact it's obvious that it's the ending but with Arrival that doesn't appear to be the case. There's no scenes of bloated exposition so the audience can grasp what is happening, here Denis uses that to his strengths. We're not supposed to fully fathom the themes expressed as that would defeat their purpose.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve is a man i would just love to sit down and talk to for 2 hours. He's one of the most interesting and original directors to enter the limelight in the past 10 years. How he even managed to come up with such a story in the first place is just completely baffling to me. This isn't a film, this is an experience, and no amount of words I write on a website is going to create that experience for you. You just need to get your ass down to a theatre."

","SF fans congratulated ourselves when seeing that, finally, somebody was paying attention to Ted Chiang's beautifully-crafted short fiction. 'Arrival' is based on his 'Stories of your life' but it is, ultimately, a sad distortion of what Chiang's story is about. Instead of an intimate tale and a mystery, we're given the typical militaristic story told 1,000 times. The screenwriter insists on explaining what needs no explanation and absurdly misses what the story really narrates. No wonder many spectators are confused, believing that the opening minutes are actually a flashback... So, please, do yourself a favor and read Chiang, forget this flat, conventional film as soon as you can. Except, that is, for the accomplished way in which the alien language is represented, the only saving grace of the film."

And curiously, one of the main characters behaves in the same mindless way as a character in Prometheus and removes her protective gear so that the aliens could see her better....It seems stupidity is contagious.<br/><br/>For god's sake, aliens are contacting humanity for the first time and all the directors and script writers have to show is this sugary syrup of a story? And the twist (yes, of course, there is a twist) is mind- boggling stupid.

","I love cinema and I love movies. But, boy! that one was hard to take. <br/><br/>I don't usually write negative reviews, because I like to spend my time and my words on the movies that I love and not on the movies that I hated. But since this movie has such a high score on IMDb (more than 8!) and some people are calling that crap ""a masterpiece"" I felt forced to write something about it. <br/><br/>Science-fiction movies are not my favorite, but if they are amazing, I can really love them. I loved Blade Runner, Alien, Matrix, and Interstellar, to name a few. Those movies are masterpieces!<br/><br/>Arrival is pretentious, depressing and super boring, and, as somebody said over here, it has more holes than a Swiss cheese. The script has many flaws, and nobody seems to notice that. We are not stupid, you know? The ""aliens"" (those ridiculous giant squids with elephant skin) say that they need the humans every 3,000 years. Why? Nobody bothers to explain that. Then, a professor who speaks many languages is supposed to translate the ""language"" of these aliens that sounds, as somebody also said over here, something like ""jfhjkdfgkdkjhakjagfjgfhj"". So ridiculous!<br/><br/>All the characters -with the exception of the one of Louise- are completely empty. And we only feel for her because in the beginning her daughter dies, but she becomes quite annoying with her suffering face and her mascara on her eyelashes (who would bother to paint her eyelashes on a moment like that?). Who are the other characters? a bunch of ""nobodies"", and we really don't feel for them. In a moment I thought: if the aliens kill all these people, who is going to care? The future-husband: is he a physicist? his role is completely superfluous. Then: the ""bad guys"" are, of course, China, Russia and other anti-American countries, who decide to cut off the communication and attack the aliens. Boooooooh!<br/><br/>Some people say that this movies is deep and ""intellectual"". Well, if you want deep and intellectual, go read some philosophy books, and don't waste your time on a stupid pseudo- intellectual-pseudo-moral-and-pseudo-science-fiction movie. <br/><br/>Arrival is so boring that I got really distracted by Amy's ugly and pointy nose. I almost fell asleep and I never ever fall asleep in movies. <br/><br/>So, at the end, what did these aliens do? They almost caused the Earth's destruction and ""blessed"" Louise by making her learn their language, which makes her see the future -like a curse-, and know the horrible death of her daughter as a teenager. Such a treat! <br/><br/>I would give ""Arrival"" a 2, but since the music was good I give it a 3. If this movie wins any award at the Golden Globes or at the Oscars, we can say that Americans finally lost their sense of good cinema and art. Greetings from Madrid!"

It is refreshing to see someone try to make a different movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this movie fails at everything it intends to do, it is ridiculously predictable, except for them the timing of events, there is some hopscotching of a few scenes, that in the end only adds the thought provoking question of whether to make a baby or not knowing the baby's future, being a father it is not an easy question, but that adds nothing to this Sci-Fi movie, it would have been better used in another movie context.<br/><br/>Almost 2/3 of the way through the movie is already resolved and utterly boring. Honestly, did anyone think they would not be able to communicate with the aliens ?? Did anyone really think the scientist was not going to end up with the translator ?? Did anyone really think that having alien ships spread across the globe was not going to bring us to the brink of war or force humans to cooperate ??? (this movie actually does both), Did anyone really think that the bomb was not predictable, and worst of all, it was not even properly justified in the plot, I mean, two soldiers, of what I suppose are elite teams surrounding the alien spacecraft, see this video of a guy ranting about the aliens and become motivated to endanger all mankind, just by seeing this video ??? Absolutely and completely not believable. Did anyone really think she would change the future ???<br/><br/>Truthfully, this movie has a good starting concept, but all of its implementation, development, which there is little of it, is rustic, basic and downright bad.<br/><br/>Watch the trailer, has the best bits, don't waste your money.<br/><br/>Really, I'm still wondering what was the point of this movie, I can't believe there are people calling it a masterpiece, it's really really bad !!!!!!!"

","Well technically this is not a 1 star, but the 8.5 rating feels so repulsive to me that I cannot help myself. THis movie was not good- even though it had all the tools to actually be good. It had decent cinematography (First scene when helicoptering to the ship was really nice actually, the way the background sounds melt into something like a son, really liked that) and the score was pretty nice. Some tracks are very original and well produced, others are the kind of typical OST, but good nevertheless. The first half of the movie had me interested, the mystery was clear and how it will be solved was definitely the biggest part of the movie. Unfortunately dialogues and especially the scenes with her kid were just off. All the scenes with the little girl sucked. The dialogue was bad, too cliché, too wannabe emotional. If any German read this - one line at the end of the movie is literally a Fielmann advertisement. Literally. ""If you could relive your life one more time, would you do everything just like you did before?"" No, Amy Adams would buy her glasses at Fielmann from the very start. Lmao. So dialogue is bad, and the worst thing about it is that the twist cannot make up for it as it also sucks. It is obvious and feels rushed, as if the writers were not sure how to pull off a real ending to this story and they just pushed whatever came into their mind. It was poorly constructed and fairly obvious. All in all movie deserves 3-4, maximum 5 stars. It is Interstellar in poor. If you like SciFi give it a try, apparently many liked this movie (i do not know why to be perfectly honest) and if not just stay away. Definitely not worth the watch for the regular movie watcher."

I was flabbergasted that anyone had been able to raise the money to make this truly awful film.<br/><br/>The story was feeble: bunch of aliens turn up and they're not awful, but want to teach us how to help ourselves. They communicate with squiggles that only Any Adams can decipher. Oh and somehow she manages to save the world by spontaneously speaking Mandarin.<br/><br/>The plot holes are simply too numerous to mention: the way in which a random academic is simply allowed to run the operation is not credible, the dialogue is wooden (and clichéd). The acting is lame. The special effects are so so. The aliens are laughably bad. <br/><br/>The editor must've been on strike when they brought the footage in since he left in oodles of material that could easily be left out (if I see another floating, cloudy scene of an obscured heptapod, I think I'll retch). The cameraman also had an off day and the director, I hope, will soon be looking for other work in the film business -- perhaps he can sell the popcorn, since he's clearly not up to the job of telling a story.<br/><br/>All that said, the other reason I am stunned is that, at the time of writing, this film has an 8.4 rating on IMDb and the showing that I attended was sold out (although some folks wisely didn't bother to take their seats).<br/><br/>For me it was 116 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.

"lasttimeisaw","9","37","72","9 September 2016"," ARRIVAL confidently manifests a striking tack of visual austerity which rings true to 21st century's zeitgeist
","Denis Villeneuve's Venice-premiered Golden Lion contender, based on Ted Chiang's acclaimed short story, is this year's annual hardcore Sci-Fi offering from Hollywood, a trend inaugurated with Alfonso Cuarón's GRAVITY (2013), and followed by Christopher Nolan's INTERSTELLAR (2014), Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN (2015). ARRIVAL dauntlessly tackles a probable but critical scenario on the precondition that one believes there are life forms off-world, which most Sci-Fi works heedfully gloss over: What if the extraterrestrial creatures' communicative mechanism, their pattern of logic and intelligent competence, or in a more interactive sense - their ""language"", is totally different from ours and radically beyond our ken, how can we communicate with them, even on a very basic level?<br/><br/>This basically sets the context for Villeneuve's solemnly cerebral head-scratcher. Dr. Louise Banks (Adams), a linguist, becomes the chosen one, enlisted by the US military Colonel Weber (Whitaker), when mysterious spacecrafts arrive on earth without warning (12 different loci across the globe, including one in Shanghai, my hometown). The team also includes the mathematician Ian Donnelly (Renner) and Captain Marks (O'Brien), they are sent to investigate the reason of the arrival when our world is veering into a global war (where China usurps Russia as the driving force spoiling for patriotic warfare). They enter the spacecraft hovering above the US soil, which grants its access every 18 hours, confounded and staggered by the anti-gravity abnormality, the elite team reaches the meeting point where the first contact has been cautiously attempted and initiated between human beings and the highly intellectual aliens, coined as ""heptapod"", whose appearance resembles a giant octopus with multiple tentacles, from which they can express their language in an ideogram form (a grand circle with hieroglyphical inspirations).<br/><br/>Louise takes baby steps in the ongoing progress of interpreting heptapod's language and deciphering their intention, but finds it extremely fascinating, concurrently, segments of her teenage daughter Hannah (a palindrome name aptly selected to comply with the novel's determinism slant), who died prematurely in her adolescence due to some terminal disease, which audience has already seen from the film's beginning as an intimately heart-breaking flashback, repeatedly materialize in Louise's consciousness, yet, the intriguing part is, what we perceive as flashback is actually flash-forward, at that point of the time-line, Louise hasn't yet to be pregnant (although she has already met her future husband), it is through her contact with heptapods, she is enlightened and inexplicably acquires the ability to foresee her future, thus, will she still want to bring Hannah into this world after realizing that she will lose her forever soon after?<br/><br/>A more urgent question is the purpose behind the heptapods' arrival, it is always delicate to elucidate a recondite scientific ideology clearly using this particular medium, how can we comb through their unique realm of thinking and behavior which has literally surpassed the scope of human understanding, to presume a plausible answer? So, it is not surprising that Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer opt for a more blasé and straightforward solution (Louise's bestowed prescience) to nip the impending war in the bud and heartily concretize the integrity of human species on a more vast and mysterious galactic map.<br/><br/>Amy Adams staunchly carries the whole movie under her shoulder, touches the right chord as a savvy and doughty wonder-struck scientist who experiences the most unthinkable encounters and remains true to her cause, exemplifies the superlative virtues of us earthlings, she is magnificent to behold and the warmth and courage generated from her character are so vehemently affecting. Jeremy Renner, contributes a low-key, almost too well-disposed and even nondescript presence in the back seat, devoid of any kind of malice or ill-feeling, a fitting analogue of George Clooney's chummy persona in GRAVITY, just to be supportive and helpful to our heroine.<br/><br/>ARRIVAL confidently manifests a striking tack of visual austerity (breathtaking set designs and awe-inspiring VFX teamwork to create heptapods, their written language and their Brobdingnagian flying vehicles), which rings true to 21st century's zeitgeist: minimalist, ultra-streamlined, less-is- more and apocalyptic, there is no flashy action set pieces to numb our senses, instead, the story adheres to Louise's personal revelation from A to Z, and the ghostly pervasion of Jóhann Jóhannsson's score is as soul-stirring as the images we are blessed to watch. After all, perhaps, the upcoming sequel of Ridley Scott's Sci-Fi chef-d'oeurve BLADE RUNNER (1982) might not sound as awful and doomed as it seems to be, a distinctive style shift can really pique our interest with the tastemaker Villeneuve at the helm."
"sportello29","8","34","66","8 October 2016"," Why are they here?
","Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is a study of how humans communicate and attempt to understand each other. It examines human relationships that are endured through time, bringing into perspective the intricacies of our language and our interactions with something we don't understand. Only lastly is it a sci-fi movie about extraterrestrial life. <br/><br/>Villeneuve has proved to be a director of utmost talent and diversity, but also the one that surrounds himself with equal talent, the Arrival being no different. Young's (Selma; A Most Violent Year) cinematography and style in depicting the research groups enter the mysterious ships produces some of the most groundbreaking sci-fi scenes that have ever been shot. The ships themselves look like timeless, shapeless monoliths. They defy the laws of physics and seem to have their own atmosphere inside. It is truly a grandiose, terrifying, unknown object. The Aliens inside those ships as well as the surroundings seem to raise more questions then answers, while the ships gloriously 'stand' on the backdrop of incredible landscapes, such as oceans, mountains and panoramic plains.<br/><br/>Jóhann Jóhannsson is a long time favorite of Villeneuve, producing scores for Sicario and Prisoners. In Arrival his score elevates the scenes, adding tension utilizing mostly classical, timeless sounds. It is some of the best work Johann has done to date. <br/><br/>Most importantly however Arrival brings a story that is original, beautifully ambitious and most surprisingly relatable and real. Real enough to believe that if this had happened tomorrow, the outcomes would not have been much different. It might however be that ambition that sometimes separates Arrival from being a true masterpiece. <br/><br/>We witnesses the Arrival of the Alien ships through the eyes of a linguist professor, Dr. Louise Banks, convincingly played by Amy Adams. Louise is constantly haunted by a series of flashbacks depicting her daughter's life & early death. It is unknown how this is connected to the Arrival, but this relationship establishes the infrastructure for what Denis is possibly trying to convey, the pain and joy that language, time & communication bring. <br/><br/>The aliens don't seem to be hostile; rather, they are trying to say something that a human can't translate. This is where Louise is required, trying to communicate with the aliens to understand the purpose of the arrival. However as the inability to understand grows, so do human frustrations, leading to inevitable disputes, wars and drastic actions. <br/><br/>In Arrival we see China as the first country to decide to take actions against the aliens, with no apparent reason. In a comically ironic scene, we see the Chinese leader give the Aliens 24 hours to vacate before starting the attacks. Communications stall as all the research groups go offline, while Banks and her team race against time looking for answers. <br/><br/>Some parts of the Arrival echo the Roadside Picnic by the Strugatsky brothers. There, Aliens have come and left, leaving behind mysterious 'zones' filled with objects that only 'Stalkers' dare to explore. The metaphor that humans perceive aliens similarly to how insects perceive humans & human objects, imagining a group of ants stumbling upon an abandoned roadside picnic, full of mysterious objects and sights. <br/><br/>Yet the message of the Arrival is different. It originates from a kinder place, it projects the need for working together, for using language to try and understand others. In this sense the sci-fi aspect of Arrival can be seen almost as an allegory to say that as humans we owe it to each other to communicate more before taking actions, regardless of how painful the outcomes might be. I fear many will critique The Arrival for this 'kindness', for deviating from a more traditional resolution, but it's refreshing. That a director is able to portray an Alien arrival in such a rational, artistic and melancholic way is a tribute to his strength of character."

Lets talk some real science here. I have been studying languages too and I am a physicist by trade so I think that I am more than qualified to make a judgement call. The biggest flaw of the movie is that it makes absolutely no sense. Apart from the fact that the aliens just started to scribble everything down instead of communicating vocally (If you were in a foreign country where people didn't speak your language you wouldn't just start scribbling things down). It's impossible to decipher a completely unknown language without prior knowledge about the syntax and etymological nature of the aforementioned language. If we were unable to decipher the Voynich manuscript for over 500 years we won't be able to decipher an alien language in a mere month. That's just a fact. Sorry<br/><br/>Both protagonists are technically superfluous. Everything that they've done in terms of deciphering the language could've been achieved in a timely fashion by simply utilizing ML (machine learning) algorithms. I know this to be true because that's what I'm currently doing for a living.<br/><br/>The movie ends with one of the protagonists asking the other: ""You wanna make a baby?"" How very classy and romantic... (Sarcasm)<br/><br/>Concluding remarks: the whole ""they have a non-linear understanding of time"" babble is pseudo-scientific hokum.

","I am drinking in a coffee shop near the cinema trying to forget the 45 minutes of Arrival I made it through before leaving my girlfriend and her two friends to slog it out to the finish. This is not the first time I have left a date at a bad movie so I tend to do a fair bit of research ahead of time to be safe. There were warning signs but no red flags so I gave it a shot. My biggest hesitation was the plot of the army plucking a random prof from an easy coast university (it looked like Concordia in Montreal to me) to take charge of the biggest operation they have ever faced. That ain't gonna happen folks. I should have listened to my gut. I could be drinking at home instead of waiting for the agony to end. I can't really comment about the cheesy opening narrative frame since i did not stick around to see its inevitable conclusion. I presume her dead daughter somehow inspires her to solve the riddle somewhere in the third act. And that she then decides to hook up with the scientist who was playing the Jeff Goldblum character from Jurassic park when it is all over and have more children because she is finally over the pain. After the first ten minutes I found myself hoping beyond hope that we would spend half an hour or more in a discussion of how Portuguese sounds different from the rest of the Romance languages - c'mon Galicia! Alas it was not to be. Instead we get an army helicopter landing at the waterfront mansion which she shares with no one, and Idi Amin barges in and begs her to turn off her TV, put down her wine, and get in the car. And she of course refuses, only to change her mind five seconds later in a contrived childish hissy fit of academic pique which the real Idi Amin would definitely have recognised as a major red flag. So off they go, joining Jeff Goldblum in the helicopter for the quick jaunt off to... Montana!? Ever flown a helicopter to Montana from Montreal (OK but somewhere on the east coast probably NYC)? No, you haven't, because it would take all week. You might do it for fun if you were not in a hurry. If giant squid-filled space eggs had just landed from another planet and you were the key to understanding them, you would likely avail yourself of a more expeditious method. I think this was about the first time I looked at my watch and it was about 25 minutes and I knew I was doomed. I started preparing my exit, putting on my boots, double checking that I had my phone, bike lights, coat, hinting to my gf that I might have to ride this one out elsewhere. Next thing I know we are on a Skyjack -no really, this is how the US army takes on alien invaders, and I am covering my eyes to protect from the cheese. I made it to when she pulls the white board out like a scuba diver and writes HUMAN and thinks her chest and brothers and sisters, I made for the exit."

","Remember the story of the king who got ripped off by the tailor who said he had ""An expensive, exquisite material"" that ONLY INTELLIGENT people could see? The king, not wanting to appear stupid, paid dearly for his new robes. The story spread through the town, and when the townspeople saw their king marching naked, THEY did not want to appear stupid, and all admired him. Until a little child pointed at the king and cried""He's NAKED!"" The child's honesty made everyone, including the king, realize they'd been tricked by their own EGOS. The people who are writing these GLORIOUS reviews-what are YOU on? I'd like some. if you're a parent and your teenager or a little older says they liked this, you failed in film education. I know today's kids don't like black and white films(that breaks my heart) but if YOURS do, start with ""The Day The Earth Stood Still""-the original, not the Keanu Reeves yawnfest. Believe it or not Charlie Sheen made a great movie called ""The Arrival"" and it was a great movie-we thought this boring, pretentious bore was a remake. Sadly, no. Close Encounters of The Third Kind is still the gold standard.""Fire In The Sky"", a supposedly true story(they convinced ME, scary stuff!) E..T.,for gods sake, had heart, humor, tears, and believability. Show THESE to your kids, or better yet, watch WITH them, and remember what Hollywood COULD do. A lot of people talk about ""Independence Day"", but it was SO disappointing, one minute serious, the next minute, childish humor. And the original ""War of the Worlds"" - the Tom Cruise remake was pretty frightening too, but a little too much of the screaming little girl and disgruntled son. This movie was SO BAD, I had to take an ADDERAL to stay awake, and I NEVER fall asleep at the movies. There's NOTHING HERE, folks, no matter WHAT the king says he's wearing. I read 13 pages of the reviews here, and the ones who gave it a good rating were AS BORING AS THIS MOVIE. ""Look how intelligent I am, I really understood what the message was. I could be the next Elbert!"" Uh, no, no, and DEFINITELY NO. I sure do wish Roger were here, he would have warned me. If you really feel you must see it, WAIT UNTIL ITS ON T.V.

","You can remove the aliens altogether and the story would be equally absurd, although it seems the direction prefers to employ them in order to bypass logic/common sense, especially regarding the concept of time. <br/><br/>Time is just 'consequential change', and in measuring it we rely upon the regularity of a repeated process, as recorded in our memory. So how does learning a language factor in here? You neither perceive/experience phenomena/events nor foresee them through language, but through senses and intelligence. How would learning a spoken/written language boost your brain processing power to the scale of calculating an infinite multitude of future scenarios (basically chaos), or boost your memory so you can read all this info from a screenful of circles (so that you could then foresee what the dying wife of a Chinese general would tell him on her deathbed in one specific scenario)? Thus the movie results in a chain of suspensions of disbelief, fully removing the sci from sci-fi... <br/><br/>Either that, or it's all happening inside the protagonist's head as a dream, hallucination or some type of seizure causing all the incoherence (judging from the coffee bean ships with fish-tank squids squirting semantics through coffee mug stains, it's probably happening in a coffee shop). Unfortunately the message trying to be conveyed is lost in pseudoscience - and the protagonist's choice doesn't follow the movie's logic either. If she can foresee the future, why not choose the best one out of the infinite possible scenarios of if-thens that are unlocked for her from alieni ex machina, surely there would be some better future in an infinity of if-thens than just the set-in-stone one she keeps hallucinating of.<br/><br/>Alternate gist of it in sci-fi terms: <br/><br/>Space-faring squids infect human patient zero with a brain virus which she proceeds to spread all over the planet in order to make humans ready for when they'll need our 'help' after the Earth has performed 3k helices around the Sun from the start of infection. The virus enters victims through an undisclosed procedure, as the movie starts with patient zero already experiencing the virus' effects (probably through some type of focused radiation at extraplanetary distance), and works by implanting directives as personal memories to the CNS and achieving the zombiefication of the victim who, due to a clever subroutine of the virus, now believes these directives to be his/her own choice (as he/she now 'remembers the future' from interpreting coffee mug stains which he/she believes to be language symbols of a space-faring species). The intricacies of this long processing of humans are probably stuff for a sequel and the stepping stone to their Arrival."

","I love SF, but I didn't love this. First, it is slow. It is so slow I nearly fell asleep. People were leaving the theatre. Agonisingly long shots of the heroine with quivering lip trying to show fear, instead showing angst and indecision. 'Mood' shots that bore. Repetitive motifs that are simply dull. Second, it tries to be dramatic and fails. Horribly. Overly loud music/sound effects (think Cloverfield without the menace), super-slushy strings for emotional scenes that are not that emotional and I found it difficult to care about, and a score that is just odd, like bad ambient music. Third, the actual story is nothing special. Heroine is called in to save the day, after difficulties, she does. Wow. The 'reveals' are not exceptional, and the whole basic premise of the film, the 'thing that makes it special' is so contrived that no matter what happened or you wanted to happen could be inserted and explained away. It's like a McGuffin. Fourth, the plot has a glaring hole in it, you wonder why 'they' did what they did in tat way. It just doesn't make sense. I liked the idea of the film, but the execution was really poor. Sunday evening with partner on the sofa, under a blanket with a bottle of wine."

","(spoilers) ""Arrival"", directed by Denis Villenueve is a one-trick pony Sci-fi movie that wears thin about midway through its long feeling runtime. Perhaps the story from Ted Chiang was better done, but here in the movie we are put through some linguistics philosophy and a quasi time loop dream sequence. It feels like smoke and mirrors because it is. The explanations are dream-like imagery, and the meaning or motivation is lost. There's of course clichéd string orchestra as usual blaring (at least better than singing). The revelation that Adams character saves humanity by phoning a Chinese general is anti- climatic, hand-waving and ludicrous. The supposed tension is set by big-bad China. Yes, it used to be the Soviet Union as the big bad villain country for filmmakers, and in ""Arrival"" its China. This is a shameless ""I need a sufficient villain"" to manufacture tension. Also poorly thrown is film-makers need to show news feeds as sort of validation of reality, as if media is the social hand that feeds. ""Arrival"" has an interesting setup and reveal of Alien Life forms, but the writing/script seems to be too smart for its own good. The last 1/3 of the movie is a complete mess. Sorry the child died, move on - blah. I've read it being compared to ""Contact"" and ""Midnight Special"", both of which are hands down better movies. Cannot recommend 4/10."

","Having watched DOCTOR WHO earlier today I'm always reminded what a unique effect both DW and STAR TREK have had on the human psyche . If nothing else both shows have made mainstream human thinking that science fiction is all about scary monsters and super creeps . To be fair the most diverse type of literature is science fiction and rarely concerns itself with sci-fi pulp fiction with humans beings stalked by horrible creatures on a remote outpost . <br/><br/>This film ARRIVAL uses the old cliché of spaceships landing on Earth where humanity finds itself wandering what the aliens agenda is but very quickly the audience find themselves watching a film where other action motivated clichés aren't forthcoming To be fair I knew in advance what I was getting - somewhat talkative science fiction where the story revolves around a mystery and the humans trying to unravel a mystery as to why the aliens have arrived and there's a problem in that unlike most movie aliens they don't speak Queens English .<br/><br/>You can see what the film is trying to do . It's not the aliens who are the danger to humanity but humanity itself . The narrative often cuts away to show us news reports as to how the human race react to the alien arrival and it's not pretty . One can't help thinking the producers might have had an eye on a Trump victory in the White House race . Little things like this might be behind the film's fairly good acclaim and word of mouth <br/><br/>That said the film concentrates on the communication problems between the unearthly visitors and the main protagonist .Unfortunately this isn't perhaps as compelling as it perhaps could have been . There's also a plot twist towards the end which raises more questions than answers and seems to be cynically included to set up a possible sequel . Make up your own minds if it deserves one"
"canozer123","7","33","68","3 February 2017"," Missed Opportunity
","I was excited to see the film, hoping that finally a movie would explore just how rich the possibilities of communication are. But nope, we again and again get a very anthropomorphized bred of aliens.<br/><br/>It bothers me that they have too much in common with humans. Their primary medium of perception is visual perception apparently; they not only use visually perceivable system of communication, but also react to external stimuli by visual observation (doing nothing but looking at the humans as they arrive on the ship).<br/><br/>Their language is of course easily translatable to human languages within a few months. Just try to translate the communication system of bats or dolphins; you cannot. Alien communication should be even harder as we do not even share basic genetic familiarities with them. The only reason we cannot understand dolphins, but we can somehow teach gorillas sign-language, is that both humans and gorillas have a lot in common in how they conceive reality. Our concept formation processes are similar, hence the availability of a translation between our systems of communication. This should not work for aliens.<br/><br/>Other than the issue of communication, the movie itself is just another example of a typical Hollywood flick. The Americans are the good guys, and the Chinese, the Russians and some other Muslim countries are bad guys. The main characters end up romantically involved just like in any other movie.<br/><br/>There is one good thing that Villeneuve does exceptionally well, and it's that he can show the paranoia, the pessimism, the capacity of destruction that lie within humanity. Incendies and Sicario were good movies in this aspect; they weren't filled with naive optimism, but a realist pessimism. Arrival does it well too. It's right in saying that the biggest obstacle of humanity is humanity itself.<br/><br/>Lastly, there's the aspect of being able to perceive time non-linearly. Yes, language is more than just naming objects. It's the bedrock of culture, and science for that matter as well. But it's not a magical potion that gives you superpowers. I hated that aspect of Interstellar, but as most scientists found the movie okay, I just said maybe I am scientifically illiterate. But I know that in this movie, science-fiction becomes a fantasy."
"jcot123","6","32","66","28 November 2016"," Dead on Arrival
","It's fitting, I think, that the main action of Arrival takes place on a barren Montana plain, because while pleasant looking in it's own nondescript way, the film itself is flat, empty, and mostly devoid of complex life. To begin with the highlights, Adams and Renner give frankly admirable turns in the roles they are given, and to go a step further Adams may well have salvaged what could have otherwise been a dull and forgettable part, one of a legion of 'approachably smart' tragic geniuses that movies and TV can't seem to get enough of. Whitaker and Stuhlbarg, unfortunately, are not afforded enough screen-time or overall thought to distinguish them from their narrative roles, and are given no chance to shine through the thick soggy blankets they've been written under.<br/><br/>Arrival is a film that asks many questions and then proceeds to forget about most of them, to instead answer a set of completely different questions. If its title, its synopses, and the entirety of its marketing campaign had given off a general impression that the mystery at its center in any way concerned aliens and that the unraveling of this mystery would be its thesis, this impression is not well founded in the film itself. To save a reader the price of a ticket, the sum of what is learned of the aliens and the path taken to discover it, ergo the majority of the film's runtime, is simply not very interesting.<br/><br/>The special effects, while serviceable, are not good enough on close inspection to be a selling point in their own right. The CGI would not look out of place in 2006, the designs are too grey and familiar to hold one's attention, and the film is too sedentary with its fantastical elements to qualify as a visual spectacle.<br/><br/>The characters for the most part are flat archetypes, such that were it not devoid of all humor, one could be forgiven in mistaking Arrival for a Roland Emmerich movie. The framing and interactions are practically paint-by-numbers; brilliant liberal arts professor and her encyclopedic recitation of internet listicles, the self- superior yet hunky scientist, and the the gruff colonel who exists merely to have things explained to him on the audience's behalf and to provide a false sense of conflict whenever he disagrees with the protagonists for no good reason. The characters are at best nothing new, and together with the dialogue, I was put more in mind of a low-grade CBS procedural than the thought-provoking cinematic experience this film was evidently trying to be.<br/><br/>Of course this is all driven moot by the film's ending, in which the audience member is slowly given to realize that the preceding ninety minutes was nothing but a plot device within an almost entirely unrelated personal drama. At it's heart, this, although I won't spoil what it is, is what the movie is actually about. The aliens are nearly inconsequential to this. The film is perfectly content to let the Aliens simply be aliens and explores them or the implications of what they are or do no further, beyond their relationship to this. I would feel cheated at the anti-climax if I weren't impressed at the movies bamboozling of my expectations. The weight of the reveal, which I take no shame in dwelling on as it's the only necessary part of the movie, hit me with its brunt right as the credits rolled, leaving me somewhat slack-jawed. Unfortunately whatever profundity the movie had re- earned at this point did nothing to assuage the tedium of a second viewing, and so I cannot earnestly recommend one.<br/><br/>The true concept behind Arrival, which again I will not spoil here, is an intriguing one, but a full length feature film was not the right the medium in which to explore it. I will not discourage anyone from seeing the movie, it boasts a few solid performances and isn't at all an unpleasant time sink for an evening out or an empty afternoon, I will sum up my feelings to say that Arrival is harmless entertainment that is too conventional for its own good and makes poor use of its ideas."

","I had several problems with this film, but I think the biggest was something I found out from someone who loved it - it was based on a short story. Yep, not enough plot to stretch out for a two hour movie. To say the pace is a little slow is an understatement of the highest order - things move so slowly in some spots as to make glaciers look at their speedometer to see if they are speeding. This explains all the long silences, the endless scenes of people looking off into the distance maybe at the shell (what they call the alien spacecraft - why, never explained like so much of this movie).<br/><br/>However, there are some good parts to the movie. The CGI is really well done, the aliens themselves are fairly well conceived - I would have liked it if they actually floated and perhaps came from a gas-giant environment but this is sort of spoiled by one scene. I thought the alien language wasn't too bad. It was different enough from Earth languages to seem alien - although again later when it is revealed to have a 'spoken form' that the heroine somehow understands the shine is somehow taken off.<br/><br/>The second biggest problem I have with the film is the premise that our heroine can look into the future because she immersed herself in the language. This led to a second plot that is essentially a mother-daughter story which didn't interest me in the slightest. I swear, I would have found a documentary on toe fungus of greater interest. To make this worse, this whole story is intersperse throughout the whole film - it starts with a 10 minute montage of this story.<br/><br/>Finally it is presumed that she shares this concept of looking forward and back in time with others and while she doesn't change things in her life, what about her students? Really? Wouldn't at least one of them, try to change a mark they got in class, or stop their mother from being hit by a car, or hell, going all Groundhog Day and changing their approach to a girl they really like until they get it right. There is a saying, ""to know the future is to change it,"" and I will swear to all I consider holy that if I'd known this film would be like this, I wouldn't have watched it."

","100% on Rotten Tomatoes? WTF?! I'm a big sci-fi movie fan especially if its story is quite philosophical and cerebral which IS the case with Arrival, but it got bogged down in the complexities of showing how humans would communicate with a superior alien intelligence amidst a distrusting and violent Earth society. Figure out how to communicate quickly enough with the aliens in order to prevent war is the main premise.<br/><br/>I got confused. There are dream like flashbacks that at first don't make sense, combined with a lot of Amy Adam's long drawn out ogle eye'd tearful stares of bewilderment morphing to fear bordering on amazement as she attempts to communicate and build a vocabulary as a translator with the alien entities. Yes! Great visuals and audio to keep me interested in how this was done.<br/><br/>But this movie relies heavily on building tension this way from an audience with high expectation and anticipation of what's going to happen next with a pay out that is a bit of a let down, drawn out and confusing to keep up with. I actually was struggling to keep from dozing off, but that may be from my trying to beat the anticipated crowds (going Rotten Tomatoes 100% review) at a midnight viewing the day before Friday release. There were just a handful in the audience that night.<br/><br/>Besides I was expecting something more profound than Jodie Foster's ""Contact"", a much better movie at relying on audience expectation and anticipation from experiencing a unique imagining of what it would be like to communicate with extraterrestrial alien intelligence that also explains how they overcome the limitations of space travel. ""Arrival"" doesn't even go there. But it's still a well made movie."

","Amy Adams plays a cunning linquist who is so smart she's one of only two people in America, the other being a super scientist, to decipher the mumblings and groanings of giant octopus-like creatures like the kind you'd see in an aquarium, only much bigger. Be prepared for lots of interminable flashbacks between Adams and her dead? dying? comatose? daughter who plays with clay animals and whose name is a palindrome, Hannah, which is supposed to be deep, profound and significant.<br/><br/>The octopi, whose are supposedly super-intelligent but can only write the letter ""O"" -- or is it zero? -- with some inky swirls are apparently benign and get along with Amy really swell. They're dubbed Abbott and Costello and any moment we can expect they'll do a who-s on first? routine in the heptopod language, which is briefly captioned so moviegoers can glean what's really on their minds.<br/><br/>Amy not only learns to speak heptopod but also knows the leader of China who is fluent in English and whispers sweet nothings into her ear. She even has his personal cellphone number, which she eventually uses to save the planet from misunderstanding what the creatures really want: to give humanity a ""gift"" of some kind, apparently a promise not to do bad things to the earth.<br/><br/>How this stinkbomb gets a 93% rating on RT and 8.5 on IDMB just goes to show how stupid human beings really are and need to be saved."

This movie had potential but should have been a short film instead. The story could have been told in 20mins. Dumbest looking aliens ever that would be best served on a seafood platter because there is no way those things could have built a spaceship let alone taken it to earth. Sci Fi can be other worldly but the level of sophistication these aliens apparently possessed stretched the borders of imagination to the ridiculous.

","Sorry for my bad English(Belgium) but when i saw the score (8.2) of this movie i thought this can't be true...it is unbelievable this movie gets such a score. I am wondering how manipulated this score is in real...<br/><br/>In global this movie is bad, very bad : Worst script ever, not even high FX special effects but for the most : a dozen things in this movie are totally laughable. SPOILER ALERT : 1. why would a highly evolved species come to earth, travel to in time, to 'tell' us : we need you ?!...Abott is dying :-). Uh, couldn't they have help themselves ?! Come on. 2. those species would have figured out to speak with us before they came, don't they ?! 3. Why would they need our help if they already knew we would have helped them in the future? Or am i missing the point ? So why come back as everything was fine? 4. Follow me : Amy has lost her child right (wheter it's a dream or not, that's not important). The child she had with Jeremy right? So she knew him, right? OK, the army comes and get her to help and she sees her husband in the helicopter...and...does not recognizes him...WHY? It's a joke, that's why. 5. When the squids would need are help, in heavens sake why would they hang their vessel so high that the marines have to use a lift ! 6. Why would the Squids make it that hard to get in the vessel when they need help ? Make it easy and put the damn thing on the ground no ?! Oh yes i see...when the screenwriters would have placed it on the ground the one and only cgi-fx special effect was gone... 7. They had problems to get in the vessel...an hour later we see are dearest Amy get in by a shuttle...those squids are really enjoying this :-) 8. Why does the door have to open every 18 hours ? why why why. It'a a joke ! 9. In the end you can see the vessel can go horizontal... if they would have done that in the first place, Amy and co would have no problem to step in. 10. The Squids leave...yes they leave without anything...just like that... 11. I could go on for an hour writing down the stupidity of this movie. It's a shame and i can not believe this score. In my opinion this score is....you know what i mean. Thnx for reading."

But it turned out even they didn't know the answers.How to communicate with the aliens? Why did they come? What do they want?<br/><br/>Let's see...Protagonist Louise (at some point in the shell just took off her protective suit so they can see her face smh moment) was teaching them our language by writing words on the board and showing the action.The aliens response were ink circles coming out of their tentacles.It felt like this was keep going on throughout the movie and at no point they achieved any conversation with them.But when a random soldier decided to blow the aliens and the 2 scientists up,in the last minute the aliens save them from the explosion(2012 like).She magical understands the two circles coming out of them without any need of analyzing the circles.''Offer weapon'' are the two words she figures out and the Chinese minister feels them as war declaration and is reading the nukes.<br/><br/>Fortunately, although everyone is packing their stuff, Louise decides to go back and after having a ''chat'' with the aliens we get the second question answered. They came to help humanity (we don't get to know from what), so humanity will help them in 3000 years (from whatt?).Now Louise having ''learned'' their circle ''language''can see into the future.So months from the event she will meet the Chinese minister and (thankgod) she tells her his private number and the last words of his beloved wife(something about war is bad).Now in the present she calls him, tells him the words and yes he decided to blow off the attack.But of course this whole time paradox didn't need to be there in the first place, as the aliens now just vanish.Their purpose was to teach Louise to see into the future?Louise even released a book about the ''language''.Can anyone who read the book now see into the future?We will have a lot o millionaires winning the lottery.Well this was the whole movie summarized in two paragraphs.<br/><br/>Besides the terrible plot we had loud annoying noises and bird(what did they brought that) twitches, between long silences which were hard to keep our eyes open at. The pacing was very slow from the beginning to the end.There never really was any agony and it was hard to like any of the characters(Renner's and Whitaker's talents were wasted).<br/><br/>I can't understand how people can rate this so high...Over-hyped as hell...It is a waste of money and time...Far away from a good movie and calling it a masterpiece is sheer blasphemy..."

Unfortunately, there are more plot holes and several omissions. No explanation is given about the coming of the ETs and their 'innocent' goals (to share knowledge). In essence, this is too much a philosophical drama surrounding the protagonist (Dr. Louise Banks) and less insight into the ETs. Unfortunately implausible plots in such a situation. Same parallel with 'Interstellar' for some unknown reason, ET's decided to aid mankind, who is being put as the center of attention in this solar system. It is unknown why the ET's put up with all the human nonsense. Certainly the movie is not thought out well enough to this point.

","The premise of the movie is good, and the movie does deliver some suspense and a somewhat new take on the story of what human kinds first encounter with aliens will be like. There are no humanoid aliens or alien technology that looks earthly for instance. It does have some clichés, like for instance ""military guy who wants to kill the aliens"" and ""science people vs military people"" which makes the movie a bit formulaic anyway. Its a shame since you can see in other places that the makers did try to do renew the ""encounter"" genre, but unfortunately they didn't go all the way. Some of these clichés are not even explained properly, and would have left big plot holes if it wasn't because the situations in question are so overused that they are more or less self-explanatory by now.<br/><br/>The movie mixes the encounter scenes with scenes from the main characters personal life, and tries very hard to give the viewer the feeling that all the pieces fit together in the end, but it feels forced and very underwhelming to say the least. You don't get that ""Aha"" feeling that makes you rethink the whole movie, but more like a ""Thats it?"" feeling. You wonder why people would go through the trouble of including aliens in a movie that is essentially about a woman and her uninteresting life choices. Its an unusual mix of genres, but unfortunately it is not very successful in this instance, and the result is a movie that is quite messy and both a weak encounter story and a weak drama.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this movie already, then go watch ""Contact"" - perhaps again.

","I really have nothing in particular against this genre though it's not entirely my cup of tea but I really have a very hard time computing the rating and applause for this movie.<br/><br/>First, on the story, I found it slow, extremely slow and laborious. The whole thing takes an eternity to build up as much as the lead actress which I found terrible. Her incapability to say more than two meaningful words up until the middle/upper-middle part of the movie really kills to whole dynamic of the movie.<br/><br/>Many scenes did not make sense like the ability for the undersea creatures to understand Latin characters, suddenly, out of nowhere, like as if these experts and military really needed Amy Adams to have figured that out, using a few-two baby insignificant words. They had all sorts of complex equations but it never really crossed their minds that they could grasp ""Human"", really? And, I'm not even sure the scene which follows after this specific sequence needs a comment.<br/><br/>Well, people might ask why I call them undersea, it's because they are a crossroads joke between Octupus, a cuttlefish throwing nasty black ink all over the place and a crab. For that matter, the analogy makes even more sense since these things seemed to be based in an aquarium protected by a sealed glass wall, floating and making some weird crustacean noises [...] I'm not really sure how the real aliens in the out there feel about this caricature. <br/><br/>Additionally, the main action scenes are fundamentally slow and boring.<br/><br/>I did not really understand the connection between Amy Adams' life with her daughter and the undersea creatures. The movie consistently tried to drive that focus in parallel with the main plot but I found it to be entirely unnecessary and perhaps used as a filling for the complete lack of interest that the main story is supposed to drive.<br/><br/>Seriously, if you're not into Hume or Niesztze type movies, you might probably want to skip this whole thing all together. These kinds of movies are for scholars and researchers, and, while I myself have reached far in studies, I don't watch movies to the same thing I do in university, hence why I failed to take any pleasure in this.

In the US a translator is employed to try to help communicate with the aliens, but at the same time the military prepare for a worst case scenario.<br/><br/>Outside of the fuss over the poster error, and the hype about how great the film is, I finally got to watch it on its own merits. On the face of it, it is a solid piece of sci-fi delivered on a big scale. With this territory comes a lot that is very familiar, and a lot that doesn't totally make sense of fit with even the internal logic, however the film mostly manages to overcome these traps by having them while also making the film much smaller. It does this by latching onto the character of Banks and making it about her. The message that it delivers through this device is not as profound as it thinks it is; it still works and had an impact, but it does throw away a lot of ideas to get to the slightly sentimental heart of the matter.<br/><br/>It is Adams' performance that carries this. She sells her character at almost every stage, and as the film focuses on her it means that we go with the film. The supporting players provide plenty of familiar faces and a feeling of quality, but do not add as much as her. The high production values and effects mean nothing breaks the world- creation, and it makes it easy to go with.<br/><br/>In the end it is not this amazingly profound film that some will tell you it is, but it is still a solidly enjoyable sci-fi that has a lot within it, and even when it all comes down to a quite simple conclusion, it still works on those terms."

","The start of this film was so promising, I really liked the alternative approach to Aliens visiting Earth. Most films of this genre always assume that Aliens will be able to understand us and we them.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert !!! My issue with the film is that the plot is just too weak and convenient. The question would be why would an advanced Alien race really care if the countries of the world get on or not, and why would they want to give us a gift? Ahhh OK lets just say that they will need our help 3000 years in the future so that's why they are ding us a favour now, so we will happily repay it one day. Also if they can travel around time and space with relative ease then why cant they sort out there own problem in 3000 years?<br/><br/>To summarise, great idea and a promising start, still interesting after 20 mins, then it starts to get over complicated and in parts very boring. Acting good but some characters seem unnecessary and just tacked on to get the A-list count up.

"Danielpotato","4","50","113","10 December 2016"," Too much drama, not enough sci-fi elements.
","Arrival follows the same line of sci-fi movies that in recent years has infected Hollywood. <br/><br/>The studios hold up known actors (we know how they will react or act in each situation - to ensure a fat box- office), a director known to the general public and who has a few well received films on the critics, and try to create these supposed sci-fi movies very close to the scientific aspect of science and reality. But without ever representing science or scientists as they really are. Putting thus absurd ideas, nothing to do with reality, and in the middle of the film, transform it into a drama (sometimes in a melodrama - Interstellar), in order to try to manipulate the audience, emotionally.<br/><br/>Arrival is the other of this new sci-fi wave, it is beautifully photographed, with great special effects, excellent soundtrack (which does not represent the quality of the technical team at all, only that the director and the producers have a big budget to spare at will), but in the background these new movies are not sci-fi movies in any aspect.<br/><br/>But things are starting to fall in the last act of the film, when filmmakers have to appeal to the emotional side. How can you make a movie about an alien invasion, and in the middle of the movie, turns it into a drama? That is right, because of that there is not enough tension, and the movie fell into the middle. <br/><br/>The sci-fi elements are few and far between. The sci-fi aspect of the film simply disappears, and the film itself becomes a basic drama with a political aspect of not offending anyone. At the end of the film the main character convinces a political leader in such a simple way, without proof. <br/><br/>Not only that, but the Aliens aspect also bothers, the aliens do not even look like aliens, but sea squid and use oil to communicate, is this a joke.<br/><br/>This movie has more holes than a Swiss cheese. Seriously, a soldier tries to explode with the spot where the aliens appear every eight hours, after seeing a t.v. report on the TV show. Such an important act and then this same character left the narrative of the film, after provoking an event as important as an explosion, without any explanation. <br/><br/>A feather, an annoyance without size. I do not recommend. This movie will certainly be a hit at the 2017 Oscar. Because of the message of the Political correctness that this film tries to pass."
"pfgpowell-1","6","6","9","11 June 2017"," Sorry, but this kind of undercooked, cod philosophical stuff doesn't achieve very much at all
","To be honest, Arrival probably isn't intended for the likes of me: I suspect its cod philosophical theory of time and faux-profound message of world peace is more intended for idealistic young teens and folk who like a bit of little bit of deep thinking between their soaps. Me, I prefer either no depth at all and just plenty of action, or real depth which treats me as an adult and can't be having this kind of cartoon-style theorising which is intended to impress but leaves you none the wiser (and, frankly, more than a little baffled).<br/><br/>Having said that – and having pretty much dismissed the contents – the packaging by director Denis Villeneuve (who made 2015's far more impressive Sicario) is handsome enough and the cast do what is required of them if not much else: Amy Adams, plain enough to be convincing, adds a certain understated anguish as the super-brainy university linguist summoned by the military to help try to communicate with visiting mysterious aliens. Oh, and she was also the single mother of a young teen who succumbed to some unidentifiable affliction.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker is a gruff, no-nonsense colonel who collects her in the middle of the night to take her to the mysterious aliens' mysterious vessel in mysterious Montana, but then has very little else to do. Jeremy Renner charms enough as the scientific companion to Adams's linguist, but he again does pretty much nothing except spout the occasional cod science and offer support to Adams when he realised things are getting tough on her (and eventually becomes her love interest in one of the least persuasive romances I've seen on screen).<br/><br/>Then there's Michael Stuhlbarg as – well, what exactly? His character is so peripheral, underwritten and underplayed that it's hard to know. You gather he is something of a villain, the government 'agent' in charge, because when Adams hits upon an easy- peasy way of achieving world peace, he's apparently not interested. Or something. The set- up is intriguing enough to hold your interest for a while: 12 extremely mysterious spacecraft (looking very much like smooth, but huge, brazil nuts in their shells, but I don't think we are intended to read too much into that) suddenly appear around the world, but the world is none the wiser as to why. They do not seem to threaten, but without somehow communicating with their inhabitants, the world is at a loss as to what to do next. Enter Adams, who had previously helped the US military with her knowledge of Farsi, and is tasked with getting through to the aliens to find out just why they came.<br/><br/>She does exactly that, and although there is no apparent timescale, the rise of civil unrest around the world in view of the alien visitors and their government's inaction makes is seem like it all takes place in a matter of days or possibly weeks. But our Amy's the gal, and don't you know it, she cracks it and is communicating with the seven tentacle but otherwise super-intelligent aliens like old friends! Yes, folks, that's Hollywood for you! It's a wonder the US government doesn't simply hand over all its research to the good folk of Tinseltown because these guys and gals are really no slouches.<br/><br/>The problem with Arrival is that it is neither fish nor fowl: the little action there is is a throwaway scene when a small group of military, fired up by right-wing TV commentators urging action, explode a bomb in the spacecraft but very little is made of that at all. In other ways it is all so sadly undercooked: the special effects and the realisation of the aliens is impressive but oddly irrelevant. The surprisingly simple – and extremely fast - deconstruction of their 'language', which also provides the key to their visit just doesn't convince. (By comparison, Jodie Foster's Contact which covers similar territory and is equally woolly still manages to persuade you of something or other.)<br/><br/>I have already admitted that I suspect I am not the target audience for this kind of good-looking melange. You might well be, and certainly other reviews here are far more enthusiastic. But if, like me, you – well, I shan't bang on. Sadly, Arrival, for all its production values strikes me as an opportunity missed."

I regret to say that I have terribly wasted my time watching this fatuous film.<br/><br/>In general, several things are extremely not right: <br/><br/>1. This film should not be classified under the genre Science Fiction. It should be place under ""DRAMA"" <br/><br/>2. The screen play lacks logic. I believe that the person who wrote it doesn't have very wide knowledge of how high and far Science Fiction genre has grown for expectations. The writer should have known that Sci-Fi fans and followers are intelligent. <br/><br/>3. The film rapidly change its focus. It jumps on the girl, then the invasion, then the something else, then the military, then some politics, then some personal drama... everything is wrong with that script because to me, it doesn't have one normal and complete story line among the above mentioned. <br/><br/>If I could, I would rate it -1."

"SomeGuyName","6","7","11","21 October 2017"," Ambitious movie squandered by improbability and plot holes
","The entire movie is spoiled in this review. <br/><br/>The movie starts with Amy Adams being a linguist professor, who's so unimportant that students doesn't even pay attention to her in the university lessons she teaches. Then, an alien invasion happens, and she's suddenly the first person the government can think of, when they need someone to decipher alien language. I don't have to explain why this doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Then, she meets these aliens, who look like squids. (Much have been made by the design of the space ship and the aliens, and I'm probably the only person on earth who was satisfied by their minimalist appearance. It was meant to look otherworldly, yet not enough to be a distraction to the story, and I think they did a fine job. Aliens can look like anything, so why not a giant black squid, with other little black squids for hands? The filmmakers know nothing about what an alien looks like, but neither do you) This is where to movie truly falls apart, and the reason for all of the hyperbolic one-star reviews:<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, you know that the language of the aliens allow them to understand time as non-linear(which apparently also means that they can see the future). But for some reason - sometime in 3000 years - the aliens are going to need our help. And to assure loyalty, they give us the gift of understanding time, by forcing us to decipher their language; taking their time to ensure that the conflicts around world leaders are resolved in the process. <br/><br/>But WHY did Amy Adams possess the ability to see the future without having learned the language at first? What made her so special? There's no explanation for any of this, and I also think it's lazy to not tell us whether we are in control of our future or not. <br/><br/>It seems minor, but this is a sci-fi movie that clearly places emotions and character above colorful, advanced space-ships. And soooo much time is being spent on tricking you into feeling sorry for the main character, by showing what appears to be flashbacks of a child growing up and dying of cancer - only to realize at the end, that she doesn't know what's going on, either, because everything she saw was something that happened in the future. <br/><br/>I also don't think that romance is the most beautiful thing that ever happened in the entire world, or even the most touching thing about humanity. This may be why I also wasn't impressed with the reveal that one of the guys from The Avengers turned out to be her future husband. I don't care! I want to know about the aliens!<br/><br/>The movie could make the romance-thing interesting, but it never takes the obvious chances to do so. Best example I can think of is, that our main character knows that if she gets a child with future husband, then that child will die of cancer. But she also knows that in the future, she will keep this a secret her husband, and chooses to have the child anyway. When she eventually tells him the truth, he will leave her and the child. <br/><br/>So many things could've been done with this. It's an interesting moral question, because even though the daughter's life was very beautiful and valuable, her husband might think otherwise. And why shouldn't he? Why should she be born, only to die before her life begun? But the movie never tells us outright what our main character will do with this knowledge, or if it condemns/applauds her for her actions.<br/><br/>In short, it's annoying to watch a movie that has such an emotional feel to it, but never takes a stand regarding it's characters. It also doesn't always make sense. I think someone very brilliant behind this movie wanted to do too much, and lost their way."

The story, such as it was, could be scribbled on the side of a fag packet for all the depth that it had. As for the rave reviews Amy Adams is getting, I can only ask ""why""?

","The hype with ""Arrival"" creates a great expectation in many viewers that are waiting for its release day. The cast with the Hollywood darling Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker seems to be promising. The sci- fi theme first encounter with aliens is highly attractive. Unfortunately the (short) story is awful; maybe adequate for a short but never for a feature. The unknown Eric Heisserer wrote the screenplay of ""Arrival"" with 1h 56 min running time based on the awarded short ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang. The result is one of the most boring and pretentious movies ever made. It is funny to see Amy Adams' character pointing herself out and telling ""Human"" to the visitors in her first contact. On the next one, she does exactly the same gesture and tells ""Louise"" to the same visitors. They might have understood very well what she is trying to say. It is also hilarious her behavior toward the army, as if she were a general. My vote is one (awful).<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Chegada"" (""The Arrival"")"

Most of the time the movie was spent trying to decode the Aliens language which was like deciphering an ink blot test. There was a bird in a cage that they brought with them when visiting the alien ship with no explanation why they always had it with them. Amy Adams had lots of flashbacks to being with her daughter back home which really had no coherent reason.

","Arrival is being called one of the best Science Fiction films in years. It is one of the best rated and reviewed films of 2016, and is drawing comparisons to Close Encounters of The Third Kind, but I have a question, did they watch the same film that I did? I wasn't crazy about Close Encounters, but that movie was leaps and bounds ahead of this one. Twelve alien crafts land in random places all across the planet, and the people are in a panic. Some countries react with hostility, but the U.S. Government decides to act cautiously (yeah right), and send Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the best linguist they have, to figure out a way to community with the aliens. The aliens, turn out to be giant octopus, whose language turns out to be ink that they squirt into the air. This movie features flashbacks and flash-forwards, that seemingly make no sense, until the end when you finally figure out what they mean and once you do, you realize that you just wasted two hours of your life. If that wasn't bad enough, the film moves at an absolute snails pace, I mean you could take everything that actually happened in the film and squeeze it into about twenty minutes. The rest is just people talking to each other about the same damn thing over and over again. Trying to figure out the same thing over and over again. Worrying about the same things over and over again. The characters have no personality whatsoever, and you might think that it's one of those slow moving weird films that all comes together in an amazing ending, but no, it doesn't. Once you can see the whole picture, as one lady in the theater so eloquently shouted out, ""really, that's it, that was so stupid."" Her uncontrolled outburst really sums up this entire film. Honestly I think the slower and more artistic a film is, the more the critics love it, but I am one critic who isn't fooled by great actors and emotional music, this isn't the best film of the year, this is the biggest turd of the year, and it should be avoided at all costs!"

She would have had little if any influence over what finally appeared on screen. And Forest Whitaker, whose presence here seems quite unnecessary, hasn't really done anything good since I saw him first in ""The Crying Game"" all those years ago.<br/><br/>Now, let me state that I am quite a fan of sci-fi movies. ""Contact"" with the wonderful Jodie Foster was much better than this load of sh*t and even Close Encounters, for its time, was a much better movie. As Alien movies go, nothing even comes close to the first ""Alien"" from 1979 (all of the sequels to that one were crap, as sequels almost invariably are).<br/><br/>""Arrival"" just annoyed me. I'm not stupid and I think I understand the circular concept of time thing here which could be the only even remotely plausible explanation for how Louise suddenly, and quite inexplicably, figured out all on her own how to communicate with the OOMOTs (Octopuses/Octopii Minus One Tentacle) as I choose to call the aliens here.<br/><br/>I quite agree with others about the utter implausibility of much of this movie. The sudden and inexplicable ability to understand and communicate with the OOMOTs, the decisions possibly about the future of mankind being made by one General after a phone call with the Secretary Of Defence (that's Defense for you Americans out there), what was the favour that the OOMOTs were going to ask for in 3000 years and who was going to be tasked to remember the commitment if given.<br/><br/>Sorry, ""Arrival"" was just stupid and a huge disappointment. I was left thinking much the same as I thought after ""Birdman"" (also a seven character title). WTF is all the fuss about?

Yet, soldiers shot the spacecraft with bullets.!!! OMG...I have to stop here. I lost 2 hours of my life watching this S-H-I-T."

","I looked forward to this movie after seeing the trailers. It looked like it would be filled with mystery and intrigue. What would the hidden plot be? What magical or devastating interactions were going to take place? Yes - that is what the trailers presented to us, but that is not what the film delivered. Not by a mile.<br/><br/>I am afraid I have to agree with all the other 1 star ratings here. This was a bore fest at best. It was as if someone wrote a single paragraph rough draft of a possible plot line, and then without any creativity or imagination, the film makers somehow stretched it in to a 2 hour movie.<br/><br/>Two hours to present something as simple as ""Gee - what if this happened?"" - ""Yeah - that would be nice I guess."" And presented poorly.<br/><br/>In the hands of the right director with some vision and passion, and with good writers that could better develop scenes and backgrounds, this might have been a pretty good movie. Instead, it drags on with very little to capture the audience, and the ending - if you even understand it - is a major ""That was it??"" moment.<br/><br/>What a shame."

","This got hyped to me as an intelligent sci-fi movie complete with a consistent, rich alien language and real linguistics terminology.<br/><br/>Well, the alien language is quite unique, and I like some of the early setup, so hence the 3 stars.<br/><br/>However most of the movie is so dumb my eyes hurt from being rolled so much. I'm not exaggerating when I say I think Independence Day was more logical and consistent.<br/><br/>It starts with Forrest playing a recording of a few seconds of noises and expecting Louise to somehow be able to translate it.<br/><br/>Then, when there is the choice of linguists to take on the mission, Louise asks them to ask the other guy ""What the Sanskrit word for war is, and its translation?"". They apparently pick her on the basis that she answers correctly, and he does not.<br/><br/>Let's go through the things wrong with this.<br/><br/>Firstly, isn't (one) correct answer simply ""war"", by definition? Secondly, how do they know her answer is right, if only the most genius- y person knows the right answer? Thirdly, does he get to ask her a question? Fourthly, what does it prove anyway? It all only makes sense in movie- logic, where if person A is more genius than person B then B's knowledge and skills are a subset of A's. <br/><br/>You may think I'm being pedantic over one small issue but the whole movie proceeds like that. I can give lots of examples: Forrest demanding to know why she's teaching the aliens such simple words -- when she had just got started -- what on earth did he expect? Ian proposing that maybe the reason for the difference in air pressure in the alien's chamber is because they are used to a different atmosphere -- apparently no-one had thought of this. Writing on a whiteboard being tried before photographs or drawing say, or even a computer display that would at least make her type consistent. The kangaroo speech (using a myth to explain, well nothing at all actually, just something that sounded smart enough to Forrest to shut him up). The bizarre actions of the Chinese and other countries. etc etc No-one on earth brings a single good idea to the table other than Louise and Ian (and he only plays a bit role).<br/><br/>Then things get gradually more and more sappy and conclude with some 15 mins or so of flashbacks to / from her future life and daughter h a n n a h. I guess after interstellar people think this is a good way to finish a sci fi movie, but it erased any goodwill about the early part of the movie for me."

","This movie is completely overrated. Interstellar it is not. The Day the Earth Stood Still remake it is not. It isn't even in the same league as the very average Contact. Which at least on first watching holds your interest, but doesn't stand up to repeated viewing.<br/><br/>The science aspects in the film are laughable. I have no idea why it has such high praise or has such a high IMDb rating. Amy Adams is quite good. I don't think I have seen her in a ""bad movie"" up until this. Not that the movie is terrible, it isn't (well not most of it anyway). The special effects (other than alien design) were acceptable, but that isn't my gripe.<br/><br/>The movie is full of clichés. Such as angry generals who want to blow everything up and only one person can stop them. Well actually that's basically the entire main plot. The aliens are laughable. I've seen more convincing ones in 1950 B movies. Seriously they're just large Octopi.<br/><br/>The entire movies message is that if peaceful aliens arrive on Earth we should be ""nice"" to them. This is where the overdone angry army officials come in. You would think, in real life, many of these generals would've already seen this type of film and wouldn't be so eager to blow everything up. I mean lets be honest, if aliens have the technology to travel across vast regions of space, manipulate gravity and even time. It's safe to assume they probably have the capabilities to withstand any primitive attack of the type humans currently have the ability to throw at them. For me this is where the entire movie falls down. It's comparable to the supposedly all powerful alien football in ID2, which isn't capable of stopping the nasty aliens from wiping out it's entire species..... It makes no sense and overall ruins the movie.<br/><br/>I don't even want to get into the ridiculousness of the stuff about language and how difficult it is for the humans and aliens to communicate. If the aliens can see through time, isn't it safe to assume they would have learned human language before even setting off on their mammoth trek through/across space/dimensions? ""I know lets just turn up on another planet and see what happens?"". Were they drunk or summin? If they were that would at least make some sense but then after sobering up why still hang around for a few more months? The science, as mentioned, also makes no sense. Nor do the decisions the aliens make. Apparently the aliens written and vocal language do not correlate. Well this then raises the question of how they managed to build ships that can presumably cross dimensions. You cannot communicate rapidly or in-depth by sign language alone! How the hell do they communicate mathematics? I kinda feel that other reviewers of this movie have completely let me down. Which makes me even more disappointed at how ""average"" the movie actually is. I was expecting more."

Maybe, because of the worry being too stupid to correctly understand the movie? But don't worry: The only thing that is stupid, is the movie itself. Actually, I liked the pictures, that's why I rated the movie with two points instead of one.

Then, about 90 minutes in she says ""Who is this child?"" The aliens solve the mystery. They tell her she can see the future: the child is the one she is GOING to have with Jeremy Renner. And he is going to leave her when he finds out she knew that their child would die but chose to have the child anyway. The big ""Sixth Sense"" surprise is that they were not memories, they were premonitions. So, are we to believe that Louise could see that she was going to have a child that would die but couldn't predict an ALIEN INVASION? And how did she know the last words of the General's wife. Did she also become psychic? The movie isn't about aliens at all, it's about what you would do if you could see the future.

Booked tickets way in advance to get good theater seats and we have been avoiding reviews all week so we could be totally blown away by all of the 'surprises' this promised. But now, after watching it, I think the majority of the excellent reviews posted on various websites must have been some kind of media conspiracy. Truly, I am pretty easy going when it comes to movie critiques - but this movie essentially blew a big snot ball all over me during the last 10 minutes. I was expecting some kind of marvelous revelation or amazing ""ah-ha!"" moment; but when the credits began to roll, I realized that was not happening. Nothing was ever really explained. I won't give away any spoilers away but what really irritated me was when the aliens were asked ""the real important question"" the answer they give is - well - you go and watch for yourself if you really want to know. This movie is just a bunch of depressing, dreary scenes, and mostly boring, but sometimes the lead actors do use some really scientific dialog. I was not impressed nor satisfied with any part of the movie. At the very least, I was hoping to enjoy watching the usual perky and cute Amy Adams, but alas she was depressed and frumpy throughout this one. Even the cinematography is bland, gray, and utterly lackluster. Then there are the alien space ships, which you have no doubt already seen in the trailers (or the movie poster), look like grey cow-pies flipped on their sides. So to you good folks out there reading this I say nay-nay on this flick. The only redeeming part of this movie is that I was able to spend some time with my family watching it together, then later discussing how empty it left us all with the ending, so maybe that was worth the $38.00 we spent on the tickets.

There is no point to anything that happens in the film, from why aliens are here, what they are doing on arrival, our reactions on a national level, and why cell phones or email seem to be unavailable for every government in the world. I really wish they would let more people review screen plays so that we wouldn't be forced to watch the same plots get dissected and re-taped together to form an original movie. Please Hollywood, wake up we are not all stupid people that like being force fed Overcooked Marvel Movies, or Frozen Raw Disnified Star Wars Repoops.<br/><br/>Based on the time trajectory of the whole Halloween Reboot, Ghost Busters, Foot Loose, Spider-Man, etc won't be long before Harry Potter is rebooted from lack of original material. I can only hope all the millennials in film school can right a good screen play since I currently can't find anyone who can. Save for BFG (Good Attempt), Midnight Special and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, 2016 has been the worst year in cinema history. It's no wonder ticket prices are up as attendance falters at theatres losing to original content on Television, Cable and Internet. Sure they say they are making more money in movies but that is just higher prices and they don't mention the lowering attendance levels.<br/><br/>And please sound track designers, we all don't need silly atmospheric strings or synths to let us know when to feel fear, or empathy, or love, the visuals and scene would be more than enough. Stop dumbing things down. Only one scene was worthwhile in this film and I know anyone will be able to figure out which one since they gave a 2 minute event about 15 minutes in this movie.

And then I had to take in the stellar reviews here on IMDb. Wow.<br/><br/>Where did it all go wrong? When was the collective decision made that movies are great just because they have an uplifting message? ""Arrival"" starts with an interesting premise, twelve spaceships suddenly appear all over the globe, and in the USA a linguist is dispatched to communicate with the aliens. And they always take along a canary bird for some reason. OK, that's great so far. I guess the big payoff is that the aliens look like octopi buuuuuuuuuut they have only seven legs and are caring-sharing-karma-believing hippies who want to help us out so that we will help them out in, like, three millenia. By talking in whalesong.<br/><br/>All over the world, the greatest minds are trying to establish some sort of understanding with the spacefreaks, but then Amy Adams, or the scientist she's playing, has the wonderful idea to write down the sentence ""Hi, I'm Amy"" on a piece of paper, and the aliens are like: Wow, we traveled over hundred of lightyears, and wanted to communicate with you in writing, but we wanted YOU to initiate it. And now you did! Let me throw some circles at you! And Amy's like: Oh finally, CIRCLES! Why, that's so much easier to decode than the whalesong you did before, let me draw some scientificy-looking vectors, and there! I've solved it! And by the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis I can now look into the future! And that totally explains all the weird flashbacks throughout the movie! But most of all: OMG, the protagonist is a woman scientist! I still have to see one convincing, let alone great movie, by Denis Villeneuve. The critics may love you, Denis. But they don't pay for their movie tickets."
"spoliteo","1","19","38","30 March 2017"," Ask for money back
","So bad I was tempted to ask for my money back. How this was nominated for any award I cannot fathom. I have read the positive reviews and am totally confused as to how they found this good. While I always like to see sci-fi movies on the big screen I suggest you rent it if you want to take a chance. Do not hold your drink in your hand as you will drop it when you fall asleep. Still have no clue how they translated the alien language. Cast good, story weak and full of filler."
"brightspark-78239","5","19","38","5 February 2017"," Can't Believe the High Ratings
","First off let me say that I really enjoy sci-fi movies, one of my favorite genres. It was with great anticipation then that I watched Arrival hoping it would live up to its hype. Boy was I disappointed.<br/><br/>My reaction after the movie finished was... wtf was that! What it is, in fact, is a series of translation sessions, twixt alien and human, all drawn out to excruciatingly boring lengths.<br/><br/>There is very little suspense, practically zero action, and even less in the way of an interesting story line. Essentially, the movie consists of a face to face between 2 giant squids (the aliens) and two humans, one a language expert and the other, I don't even remember why he was there... perhaps as the obligatory romantic interest.<br/><br/>In the end, we discover that time is circular, or was it back to front? I'm not really sure, but it was a very long and boring exercise just to reach that rather strange anti-climax.<br/><br/>Everybody sees different things in movies and opinions are always subjective. For me, Arrival was just one huge let down."
"depiratebay","1","19","38","1 February 2017"," The movie is unable to stick with the story
","It is rare that movies get me furious but this one really did. I ask myself, how did anyone approve of the script for the movie? So let me explain why you should not watch this movie.<br/><br/>Alien spaceships land on planet earth and everyone freaks out. Everyone on planet earth except for the sensible protagonists wants to blow them up because they are afraid. However, as our sensible lead characters are sensible they try to communicate with the aliens. This is trickier than expected as the aliens show no effort on their part to learn earths languages. Nevertheless, this gives the movie a plot. Study the course Alien language part 1 before the planet blows up.<br/><br/>So what makes this all so bad? A part from everyone starting to behave erratic and wanting to fire rockets at an alien race which is probably 1000 years ahead in development than you. Well, 75% into the movie, the writers did not know how to create tension or how to write a basic story. So in order to end the movie they chose to introduce a so called 'plot device'. The female protagonist apparently learns to see into the future when she learned the grammar of the alien language. All the problems of the movie then goes away as she sees what she has to do. <br/><br/>That plot device is what 10 year old's write in their short stories to tell a story. That and along with ""everything was a dream"". This movie waste your time and the writers should be fired for incompetence."

","Promise of a good Sci Fi movie but turned into a weird psychic flick. <br/><br/>**********SPOILER ALERT**************<br/><br/>""Arrival"" was the first of two...this was probably the WORST movie, I've watched in a while. <br/><br/>I like Sci Fi and this had the promise of a good alien adventure. But what it turned into was: <br/><br/>* Sketchy plot * A psychic/ Mrs. Cleo wanna be, who frequently falls into random dreams/ delusions. * Two octopus looking silhouettes in some fog that blow smoke rings * Weird story line of why the half-egg shell shapes, that are supposedly alien air crafts showed up, then evaporated into a vapor * Then at the end of the ""movie"" I felt as if this was something drawn up by a bi-polar, schizophrenic person, that was off their meds...because in the last 15 minutes (of the 2 hours), they came up with the idea, the lady could predict the future....WHAT THE HECK!<br/><br/>ENTIRE waste of two hours.

"maroon-14059","1","19","38","7 December 2016"," Arrival is the worst movie ever
","This is a stupid movie who, tries so hard to make a whatsoever 'plot twist' that might have 'blown typical people's mind' oh please, what's so plot twist bout the aliens which looked like octopus and the language is just like ink spread out on a piece of paper. And predicting the future? By what? By closing her eyes and then some cute flashbacks about her Daughter, about a Chinese man whispering to her ears and she made a phone call repeating the same words and then saved the world. The man also said that he will never forget what she said, oh my, that must be very very SUPER powerful words, but, did they reveal those words to the audience? Guess what? NO. Okay, so you are just acting a movie for yourself to enjoy, is it?If it isn't, prove me wrong please, oh wait , can you even prove anything? You can't even prove what kind of aliens they are, did not explain anything bout how she changed the future( all they had was that phone call) and did not say anything bout the father, nor the daughter, nor herself, just the language(Only shown some drawings). So, tell me, HOW is that so unexpectedly amazing that it can get 8.4? Super dumb movie that gets 8.4 IMDb due to typical idiots who vote it high just because they think it's so mind blowing. Okay. The movie is constantly showing flashbacks that makes no sense for any plot building or story building, no, none. Not even close. Not shocked to know that who's the father. And after so long watching the movie hoping that it will finally show something that has a POINT, THEN comes the word weapon, makes the soldiers panic blab-la. Erm, can I ask, why? And what's the point? You wasted my Precious time learning (or just seeing you people in the move learning) some ink language FOR SO LONG, and then suddenly a word comes up, weapon. Okay. That's SO good! 8.4 hooray! You deserve this! Oh please for fk sake's end your miserable and immature thoughts please. And what the hell is with the phone call thing? Yea yea one phone call saves the world and where the heck is the critical moment in the movie? Oh i forgot, it must be that so nervous and very intriguing phone call scene, which took 2 hours to reach that scene, and ends with a hug, with a guy who just confess out of the blue, without any romance building, how's that even close to being touching? No touching scene, boring plot with 80% of movie is about learning the alien's language by drawing and writing numbers on a paper and then programmed it in a computer. Wow, stop wasting money to produce such a stupid movie please, and Words can't describe how much I regret watching this ultimately freaki ng boring and dumb-ass stupid movie that I have ever seen in my whole life that made me comment here to show how stupid this movie is how typical these people are to say that this movie is amazing. Please wake up, there are a lot of great movies out there and frankly, this movie is just a piece of ugh, Come on, ask yourself. Would you rematch this movie? Well, unless you wanna go through all those octopus squirting ink and whatsoever flashbacks of a child laughing and running and a freaking dumb woman who uses her mouth to breathe noisy as fu c k, (she doesn't know how to breathe through a nose) and spending your precious time watching her drawing symbols on a piece of paper, okay. If you want to , go ahead. Best sci-fi? YEAH, sure. Keep deceiving yourself mate."
"doorsscorpywag","1","19","38","19 November 2016"," No David Attenborough....big mistake
","This was done much better as The Arrival Of Wang an Italian effort which sees our alien visitor needing a Mandarin Chinese translator. Wang though not that great itself had a far more interesting story, was better acted and had a better twist ending.<br/><br/>Arrival just never got going in any meaningful way after segments of a Terry's Chocolate Orange descend to Earth in seemingly random locations and sit about until their hosts try to communicate.<br/><br/>Obviously none of them had seen The Visit: An Alien Encounter which set out the protocols for David Attenborough to lead an International team and begin a dialogue.<br/><br/>Our Attenboroughless team consisted of a woman translator who seemed to be some kind of Dr Doolittle who could talk to anything. Her scientist side-kick was another Dr Doolittle who contributed absolutely nothing other than dub the two intergalactic travellers, who likely were more intelligent than both our heroes 30 seconds after birth, with rather insulting nicknames based on some movies he liked. They are backed up with some other people who try to look intelligent by staring at instruments set up in the Orange Segment. Why any of them is actually there is never explained or glossed over in one of the many conversations lost in the bad sound.<br/><br/>These anonymous extras also provide a pretty stupid scene which is ripped off from Contact. A far superior offering to this dross.<br/><br/>The film also rips off Interstellar by virtue of the fact it is even more boring. <br/><br/>A sub plot is presented to us from the opening scenes to portray the idea the woman translator as a bit damaged. This continues throughout the film and basically gives away the forthcoming twist at the end which was to astound us, but about 30 minutes in it is pretty obvious what that is all about, and it never really does.<br/><br/>As the tension rises and countries become suspicious of each other and try to hide their information we see the usual reactions with people rioting in the street and nuclear weapons being prepared. Meanwhile the scientists (or at least the Dr Doolittle translator) race against the clock to prevent Armageddon. <br/><br/>The romantic overtones which were part of this clever underplot looked fake as there was zero chemistry between our translator Dr Doolittle and the other one who would be better termed Dr Dobuggerall as he literally did nothing to justify him being there.<br/><br/>It ended as do so many movies nowadays with a clever ending that was not that clever as it was obvious from the first quarter of the film. And that was it.<br/><br/>Those who think it was genius will argue that those of us who think it stupid do not 'understand' what we were seeing. I have been watching movies for nigh on 60 years and it was just another daft sci fi outing that mistakes itself as profound when it really is dull.<br/><br/>At least Wang would have managed to kill this team of idiots who if they had taken David Attenborough instead of Dr Doolittle and Dr Doevenless it would have at least been entertaining."

","I was about 30 minutes into this movie when I realized that nothing worthwhile was happening! I wanted so much to enjoy this movie because it sounded like something I would enjoy.<br/><br/>As somebody else as commented, it feels like a remake of Close Encounters for adults - and I didn't like that movie either.<br/><br/>Some people are articulating the virtues of this movie - I wish I could have seen the movie they saw. I found it boring and slow. It was pretentious, arty and up its own asshole!!! Not much happens!! Yeah, I get the message from the movie about communication - but all of us with half a brain cell know that!!! I really would like to say something more positive, but I can't think of anything good to say! If you are going to the theater to see it, then I hope you get more from it than I did!

","I felt the need to post this review, because I couldn't understand how so many people gave it a positive review.<br/><br/>Aliens land on the Earth, and the US military wanted to find someone trained in linguistics. So far, so good. Then, for reasons that escaped me, the military was trying to explain to Amy Adams how to do her job, even though she is apparently an expert at it, but okay. I thought the development of the story was a little slow, but with Amy Adams, Jeremey Renner, and Forest Whitaker, they could read off of diner menu and be pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>Then it started to go off-track. One of the US soldiers, because our military has to be portrayed this way, tries to kill the aliens, even though they are seemingly behind some sort of barrier to protect them from the atmosphere. And, even though there are plenty of military personnel there, they apparently forgot to fence off the aliens so that no one unauthorized gets in.<br/><br/>Then, in a move that makes no sense, the Chinese decide they are going to attack. Maybe a slightly racist assumption, but we can let that go. But the aliens have been peaceful, and they are in vessels made of unknown materials, that have lasted a trip through the cosmos, but the Chinese have issued an ultimatum, to a superior species (in all likelihood), that they are unlikely to understand.<br/><br/>Then the movie completely derails. Amy Adams gets General Chang to change his mind, because she has a conversation with him, 18 months in the future, where she apparently knows what his wife's dying words to him were.<br/><br/>None of the movie made a lot of sense. Peripheral scenes show an accident in the parking lot because people were running out, for little apparent reason, riots in the streets, looting, TV commentators demanding we fire a shot across the bow.<br/><br/>When I left the theater, which was pretty crowded, there was no applause, and no conversation that one might expect to see at the end of a thought-provoking movie."

","When 12 stupid-looking ships without any aerodynamic design arrive on Earth, the linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and the mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are recruited by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to decipher the alien language.<br/><br/>The premise seems interesting, but you can quickly realize that the rest of the film is completely stupid with no logic whatsoever and cannot even be classified as abstract because even abstract things have a logical foundation. From beginning to end I was struck by the brilliance of the total lack of coherence. Whoever says this is a good movie and was moved by it is clearly lying trying to pretend to be an intelligent movie buff who realized the concept of a completely absurd and illogical film. The worst sci-fi movie of all time."

","Ever watched a movie where up until the last 5 minutes you're anxiously hoping for something to develop? but then it doesn't? If not, Arrival has Arrvied. An absolute slug-fest of a movie which draws you to flashbacks and flash-forwards of Louise's life. Meanwhile an above-average smart scientist (Ian) does nothing except express faces of awe and finally admits that he's fallen for Louise. Meanwhile the Aliens arrive on some vessel that defies every law of physics and space, they also pretty much happen to be Squid that make noises which are a cross between a Whale and a mating Lion. Louise and Ian proceed to make 54 trips back and forth to the Vessel whilst communicating to these animals via an iPad, at the same time, the World Powers are just waiting on developments from these 2 douchebags else they will send in their tanks.<br/><br/>The part that really annoyed me was that these Aliens had the knowledge to see future in 3,000 years, however neither of the 2 clown squids foresaw the future that a C4 bomb would be planted by some crazed soldier that would result in the death of one of them. It was the most unrealistic design of aliens, I think the producer was craving some Calamari when he thought of this."

The movie is simply boring. For minutes you should watch just a dark screen on which nothing goes on. And the dialogues are as interesting as a lesson on the dialects of the wooden frogs. But how this move got its high rating? Most of those ratings are coming from the young viewers. They have never seen the great movies of the 50s, and 60s, and 70s, so they have nothing to compare to. Any drivel that has a killer or a thousand of car crashes gets their high approval rating. Too bad that the movie industry is dying against our eyes."

","I really expected this will be some masterpiece after seeing trailers, reading some announcements. And I really like intelligent Sci-Fi. Only that it is very rare achievement, and sadly this one is just not Sci-Fi at all in fact. There is nothing from Sci in it. Could write here long list of nonsense, may say even lazy writing. Will just discuss few: that invitation of Louise by Colonel was total non realistic, even for Hollywood standards. Then, that climbing up in alien (apropo - why was it big thing when Louise called them first ""aliens"" ?) ship and whole solution to welcome humans there was pathetic. Of course, all it was just setup for later explosion scene - practically only action part of movie, but left me total cold, because it was so unreal and forced.<br/><br/>They should explain, give background for many things - at least give 1-2 minutes about people who placed explosive there. And no way that Louise and Donnelly did not notice in 4 minutes those big red LED downcounters. Then came that ""use weapons"" nonsense part, what should be some climax - but it was too early, and my first thought was that Louise would not say it to military people (in real World, events) - especially not because was not sure that it is proper translation. That is indeed the weakest part of movie - just forced, not good written. And whole idea about different sense of time, seeing the future is utter crap. I'm sorry, but that is not possible, and more important, they should not go in whole dying child thing there - which mother would not try anything to save her child ? This was just too extreme case. Was the point in that even she knew the outcome, she went in ""let's make child"" thing ? - my God, this was even so primitive ...<br/><br/>Much better movie could be made with just this as main theme: Girl can see the future and dying kid, abandoning husband, just meets him on work, and they make family, but then the classic question: is future determined ahead (fate) or we can do something to change it ? And of course, normal mother would do everything to save her child. Now, that would be something, even if maybe seen already. This was just attempt to make something new - new type of encounter, aliens. Most of things were just to impress viewer on emotional base, but it just worked not in my case, and may say not by most of viewers. Too bad for director and really good main actors."

","This movie is based on a short story. The idea is kind of like Independence Day, where ships appear over 12 points on earth and each ship has a team of experts dealing with it. The US team made up of Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, are the focus of the movie. <br/><br/>I have no problem with the idea behind the movie, in fact, I came in hoping that it wouldn't be a rip-off of the idea (ships appearing over metropolitan areas is not a new concept in science fiction). Many movies (and authors) have different takes on this. Regardless, the interaction with the aliens is good. The way it's done is pretty good. But, there really is not build up, and no denouement, it's just flat, all the way through. There is a bit of something, but frankly, not enough to really interest me to see it again. I kept hoping, since this is a movie that, I'm assuming, they want to win some sort of award. Denis Villeneuve did Sicario, which was excellent. Loved that movie and a couple of his others. Amy Adams, I like. Jeremy Renner, Forrest Whittaker, Mark O'Brien (whom I've been a fan of since he was on Republic of Doyle), overall a great cast. But, like I said, the movie falls flat."

I like to go home knowing my kids are safe and certainly do not expect to be dealing with questions about young life and death in a movie that needs the most ludicrous contortion of time travel to be used as a tool in order to add drama to an otherwise flat and uninteresting plot.<br/><br/>The films question is do we go on when we know the ending. I think we go on because we don't know the ending and find the alternative deeply depressing.<br/><br/>Go see it if you want to deconstruct the human condition and moralise, if you are a parent of young children or do not like the current trend for teenage angst and intellectualism given a big budget stay away."

","I found this movie quiet difficult to sit through to the end. It was supposed to be a science fiction movie but it was mostly emotional crap; filled with worn out ideas mixed into a potpourri from other recent, alien visitation, movies. Acting was too dull from the main character, too frigid, too slow; Louise Banks character should have been played by someone more dynamic; or maybe the two main roles should have been switched. Just a little change in the storyline could have turned this movie into something worth moviegoers time; if inspiration from other moves was to be taken then maybe Contact (1997) should have been used."

He has not got a sci fi bone in his body, or should I say his brain, as the film has been made by somebody who is clearly bone-headed. He thinks he can achieve profundity by having lots of loud music which drowns out the actors' voices, by having them mumble and whisper, by most of the scenes being so dark you have to peer through the gloom (all the better to see nothing, my dear), by having one of those identikit Hollywood children who lisps like an infant and cannot speak clearly, by not really showing his aliens except through a haze, by pretending to be something of a philosopher, with all the assiduity of a drunk ranting in the street. Amy Adams plays the female lead, and she at least articulates her speech, even though she has been encouraged to say everything in a near-whisper, so that we struggle to make out what she is saying, especially against the 'mood music'. As for Forrest Whittaker, who spoke perfectly clearly in THE BUTLER (2013), he has been reduced to an incomprehensibly mumbling hulk. I think I more or less understood about half of his lines, or am I just being kind? The idea that he should play a tough Army colonel was a serious instance of miscasting. He looks too nice to bark out orders such as 'move out!' But we can't understand his dialogue anyway, so in the end it does not matter. The stock scenes of tanks and soldiers with assault rifles attempting to deal with incomprehensible aliens from another world shows that Hollywood has not moved on since the 1950s. Everyone in the film seems to wear battle fatigues. But what about the fatigue of us, the viewers? There seems to be no end to this meaningless rambling film as it wanders around seeking for answers and finding none. The camera lingers so obsessively on the face of Amy Adams that the film is essentially an Ode to Amy. She seems to be the subject of about half of the shots in the whole film. Was the director in love with her? What is that all about anyway? Amy's leading man is played by Jeremy Renner, who get almost no close shots, much less closeups, and seems to have been cast in order to play the thankless role of a nonentity who would not steal too much attention from Amy. OK, OK, so the film was made in Canada, and Villeneuve is Canadian, and maybe it is not technically a Hollywood product. In which case, it is simply worse than Hollywood. All Canadian aliens should hang their tentacles in shame. A single scientific buzzword has been thrown into the dialogue, 'nonlinear'. That is all the science we get. (Nonlinear equations are increasingly important in modern physics. Don't even ask what they are, this is a film review.) There are mumbling remarks about the puzzling nature of time, but even on the rare occasions when we can hear them, they don't make any sense. Somehow Amy Adams is meant to know the future, or is it the past? It is not clear at all what she knows, although we are told she speaks Farsi, Mandarin, and many other languages. But no matter how many languages you can speak, if you have nothing to say, you might as well keep your mouth shut. Having the aliens look like octopuses is sensible, since serious writers on extraterrestrial life have been suggesting such creatures since the 1960s at least. Octopuses have big brains, and so hyper-intelligent super-octopoid aliens probably do exist on many worlds. That at least was not nonsense. But just about everything else was. And once again China is misconceived as being run by a general called 'Chairman of the People's Army'. Come on, folks, can't you get anything right?

None of that could hide the utterly pointless story woven around a 'plot-twist' that felt completely inconsequential as all the characters were one- dimensional.

"naclorian","4","12","22","24 February 2017"," Angry with 2016 garbage message movies
","Now, this is supposed to be a deep and meaningful movie for us humans. This is supposed to teach us people.. life and connection/communication between us. You know what? I am really angry right now and not because of this masochistic movie( i'll explain this later) but, because of the huge amount of public acceptance this film has gotten. I challenge each one of you that find this movie thought-provoking(in a positive way) and motivational to oppose the facts that my mind conceived. And which are those? First of all, this woman and only her acquires somehow the power to see through time. Now, as i understand aliens are granting this power to her. But why? Is this a tool she needs to understand humanity better, or to find her purpose? I really don't get it. Even if this is true, i mean, that this ability helps her, how does it help the audience, us, to build an emotion for our life purpose. What i find, is a masochistic way of thinking, where i know the pain and i am feeling it but i embrace it because i want to live it for real. The last sentence mirrors the protagonist's choice, to accept the future that she already knows is painful and not only for her. But, even if someone says that everyone know the pains and sorrows of life but still we wanna live, then i'd say OK, but why is this some kind of a gift. Seeing the future and accepting it doesn't make me any better. I don't feel better, i just feel bounded to something, imprisoned. This is lack of freedom and it doesn't motivate me to live. Moreover, in one of the positive reviews of the movie that i read at screenrant.com, the author claims that what i previously described as masochistic is freedom of choice. He says that the protagonist knows what's gonna happen to her daughter and to her but she is able to choose either she wants it or not. And i have to ask you, dear author, in what category we put the protagonist if she chooses not to give life to her daughter. It is not freedom, this is just fake freedom because it is pushing you to become either a ""murderer""(even if not a true murderer you have to live with this burden for ever) or a masochist(i explained that before). To be quite frank the decision she took in the movie, the masochistic one, is the worst and most selfish, because apart from everything else it shows that she doesn't even care about her husband's and daughter's will and opinion, so free will for her and no will for the others. Because of these, i don't see how this ability can be a gift for a human and moreover how can this hypothetical scenario can help us, as humanity, to truly love our lives and others' rather than being selfish deep thinkers who want to live their lives. As for the second part of the meaning ""Arrival"" is endowed with, which is peace and connection between people, i have to say that it is as shallow as shallowness or simply dumb. Why? Because of the reason that people come together in this movie, which is for no reason. But, please, explain me the reason that they and us, the audience, must feel connected and in peace. Is it because the protagonist in the movie tells china president, or something, the last words of his wife? Even if this is enough to bring people together in the movie, it is not in real life, so please ""sci-fi industry"" either deliver us more obvious and definite messages or just stay on star wars...."

","My adult techie, Star Trek kids loved this movie and encouraged my wife and I to watch it. Both of us were disappointed and had trouble understanding why they liked it so much.<br/><br/>This movie is kind of like a boring Close Encounters. I kept having problems with suspending disbelief with things like the fact that these incredibly advanced aliens had no clue about how to communicate with humans and left the translation attempts entirely on us. With their technology, they hadn't listened to any of our radio broadcasts or deep space probes? And they can't figure out how to squirt ink patterns in human language even after being tutored?? Or that the alien's ""written"" language is so readily and quickly deciphered by the experts? The plot develops slowly and ultimately doesn't make a lot of sense in terms of time travel/displacement, with the heroine's ""prior"" loss of her child from cancer emerging as the primary underlying theme. Meanwhile, the world is reacting to these non-threatening aliens like the Zombie Apocalypse? Total worldwide diplomatic breakdowns over the misinterpretation of a single word?? Can you imagine how differently Steven Spielberg would have done this? <br/><br/>Other complaints are: The military aspects seem wrong. While Amy Adams seems OK in her role, Jeremy Renner seems totally miscast, a wise-guy in a role that should be sensitive and romantic. I hated the music which seems sappy, trite, and out-of-place and is always reminding you of itself. What's wrong with NOT having orchestra music to help you with your emotions? And the last-second ""save"" in the climax scene with Amy on the sat phone in the decontamination room just doesn't make much sense from a dramatic, let alone technical standpoint. I've seen and read enough sci-fi about time-travel/shifting to know that this is an especially tricky concept to deal with both logically, scientifically, and philosophically, but this film misses the mark on all 3."
"stevenesheldon","5","12","22","21 January 2017"," A movie with no ending.
","This movie starts out great. Aliens arrive, and we have to talk with them. You really feel drawn into the struggle to reach an understanding, ala ""Contact"".<br/><br/>But there are some glaring places where suspension of disbelief falls apart.<br/><br/>Other countries start to somehow ""feel threatened"" and given an ultimatum to the aliens before they start shooting. But there is no good reason given for why other countries would feel this way. There is some mention in the translation of ""weapon"", but the aliens have done nothing aggressive that we are shown. So it is hard to believe that suddenly anyone would be keen on blowing the aliens out of the sky when they have done nothing aggressive and no one can understand them yet.<br/><br/>It's also hard to believe that such an incredibly advanced civilization would have difficulty communicating with humans. It should have been incredibly easy to settle upon agreed symbols for YES and NO within the first couple of days. These are pretty, dare I say, ""universal"" concepts. So once you have yes and no down, getting to some basic intentions of the aliens, like showing them an animated cartoon of one of the alien ships blowing away Earth ala The Death Star should have been pretty easy to get a yes or no answer to from the aliens.<br/><br/>But, we can overlook these things as ""just the way they are in this movie"".<br/><br/>But then just past the half way point we finally get the idea that the understanding the language alters your perception of time. It dawns on the viewer that Louise's flashbacks are actually flash-forwards.<br/><br/>But then...nothing is done with that fodder, other than a reveal that Louise uses her future knowledge to get information from the Chinese general to stop their attack in the present.<br/><br/>But it's not made clear what would have compelled the General to give her the information in the future in the first place. He just whips out his cell phone and gives her his private number but says he doesn't know why.<br/><br/>Huh? And then the entire purpose of a sci-fi movie - some kind of resolution between the humans and the aliens - is waved away. We are given this snippet that the aliens will need human help 3000 years from now, and then they leave.<br/><br/>Huh? That's it? We don't learn any awesome insightful stuff from the aliens? We just get a time language? It was a huge letdown.<br/><br/>I was expecting some scene like the father-daughter scene from Contact where we are given some kind of vision of the future, that there are lots of species out there and this has gone on for billions of years, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Arrival gives you none of that.<br/><br/>I think the move really set out to be an anti-nationalist global Kumbaya with global military leaders being mindless thugs ready to blast the aliens for no good reason.

","My expectations were sky-high. Partly cause I loved both Prisoners and Sicario and also cause of other people's reviews of this film. But boy, was I disappointed. I really wanted to like this film but could never get into the right mood of suspense and excitement. Instead I found ridiculously pretentious and boring right from the start. I could feel that many people in the theater felt the same, lots of sighs and laughter in the wrong places. The story is very vague in many places and is often cut off in a very irritating way. The film is obviously aiming for something of higher quality than for example Independence day but falls flat because it lacks both substance and feeling. This is not even close to a masterpiece like 2001. The film tries to communicate some message about communication, world peace, time, meaning of life, and how it's all connected or something but ends up a mess. The two main characters were very cliché and kept irritating me throughout the film. They were the two chosen one's who understand everything no one else does and ends up saving the world."

Listening to Amy Adams hyperventilate in a dark tunnel for 10 minutes (at least it seemed that long) was like watching the spaceship from all angles just floating in space for what seemed like an eternity in 2001. I am not a fan of action movies, but total lack of anything is the opposite extreme, and just as bad. People loved to say I just didn't understand it. But who cares?

Aside from the obvious insult to the extremely talented people who do make up these militaries, the audience also feel slightly insulted that they're being taken for the same ride again. It's like you left the TV on for too long and David from Independence Day has just cracked the Alien Code that the military men couldn't solve. <br/><br/>But the main storyline is enthralling. The sounds used in the film are masterfully done, and they almost, almost, get over the problems that the side stories have set up. A whole wonderful cast of misfired roles (Including a Forest Whitaker who has been given the direction prompt 'Be unreasonably unlikable') tar almost all of these main story scenes, in particular the ones which include the background military crew. You just can't get over the feeling that these people are stood in a green screen room, chatting amongst themselves about their weekends between takes. The gravity is just never there. <br/><br/>Then, the film goes off the rails. A clever idea - poorly executed. Like a toddler telling you how clever they are, the film shouts and shouts and runs in circles, dropping all-capital-letter SUBTLE hints for the last 10minutes to make sure you work it all out before the main characters do so you can feel smart. <br/><br/>All in all, it's worth watching. If this was the 90s it would be a great film. But it just isn't the 90s."

","I just watched ""The Arrival"" with super-high expectations, but I must say I was disappointed. It's a step in the right direction for sure, an examination of extra-terrestrial life as being curious and peaceful rather than hostile... but the whole deal with all the different languages made me frustrated and unsettled. Not to mention, Hollywood has a tough time getting away from military depictions of human reason; namely... ""if we don't understand it, we must attack it"". This is just stupid, humans know when we are outclassed technologically and if not threatened with extreme force, we would never initiate the first attack.<br/><br/>To think that a SUPER ADVANCED alien civilization would travel the cosmos and contact us is not a super far-fetched idea. Not likely that any of us will live to see that time, and most likely, we will be in space discovering other species first...<br/><br/>Here is my problem with the movie: Are we really to believe that a super-advanced species made such a long trip to contact us, but left the problem of communication to the responsibility of the lesser- developed primitive species? This super advanced alien race with all of its technology was unable to observe and study us before making contact? If the goal of this alien race TRULY was to help humans rather then total annihilation, then wouldn't it make sense that the more advanced culture make an effort to find a means of communicating with the less advanced one?<br/><br/>Later on in the movie, the main actress was communicating to the aliens with English, then subsequently reading the alien language and understanding the messages, after only being able to study the language for a couple of days or so. Meh... Wasn't really an alien movie as much as it was a romance flick with an emphasis on communication...<br/><br/>MORE FRUSTRATIONS:<br/><br/>The ""written language"" of the aliens was EXTREMELY INEFFICIENT. Much like Mandarin, it had a unique and overly-complex symbol for every new word. <br/><br/>Any advanced alien civilization would have a base alphabet of simple symbols, which in combination with one other, make words. This is the most practical way to convey information as it does not compound exponentially and does not require each individual to memorize thousands of unique shapes (like obsolete Mandarin). <br/><br/>Any idiot can make something that's complex. It takes a genius to make something simple. I would hope to give the aliens the benefit of the doubt with their advanced technology and assume that they are not ""idiots"".<br/><br/>I liked the 1999's ""Contact"" version of the alien language better. It introduced an unprecedented and innovative twist on written language, building up information on a 3-dimensional medium rather than what we are used to, writing and messages being passed on a 2- dimensional medium.<br/><br/>This was an exciting and alternative twist on alien communication which actually made sense and had practicality. Technically you could pack much more information in a 3-dimensional space versus a 2- dimensional plane, so the writers got it JUST right.<br/><br/>The ""Arrival"" writers are either lazy or incapable of thinking about things holistically and with a scientific principle. Their version of ""alien language"" had no clever or innovative twist, but rather opted out for some elaborately-drawn shapes which have no business being used as language. Just a bunch of fancy ring-shaped splashes of ink, with an excess of detail to each shape which would distract from the message and promote miscommunication. A lazy design, to be sure, done by some low-level intern who did their best to create something which appears completely foreign to us... but what they ended up with is something which would never realistically be used.<br/><br/>The movie was better than most blockbusters representing alien visits, but we still have a long way to go before making movies which both entertain the masses and satisfy the more practical viewers who desire realism."

How hard was it to show the script to some producers and curators of actual sci fi to make sure you don't look like a total dolt? <br/><br/>I am glad to see many folks who hated this movie have placed it alongside Inception as over-hyped pseudo-intellectual garbage, and called it out on its needless reliance on cheap, Lifetime-esque human drama in the same vein as Interstellar. I'll hatefully add A.I. to that list, because it's the first sci-fi movie I remember to feature such blatant maudlinism in a cheap attempt to make a festering pile of vomit seem as profound as an actual, non- metaphorical festering vomit pile on a sheet of acid. ""Who is this child?"" indeed.<br/><br/>Now that I think of it, the plot device rendering AI's ending so particularly odious - thus imbuing it with the emotional equivalent of claws on a chalkboard - was so laughably implausible by even a (non-American) grade school attendee's standards that it could safely be called ""magic"". In AI's case, it was magic math. And here too, we have the kernel of a decent sci-fi concept wrapped in a greasy wad of inconsistencies, and globbed together with scum-globs of scientific incompetence. Falls apart on every layer like a moldy onion, and tries to make you pay for it with tears. <br/><br/>I give three stars for ""Abbott"" and his alien buddies.

","The pseudo-profundo films of Denis Villeneuve throb with gloomy, sinister images and what Alvy Singer once described as ""total heaviosity."" I can't stand them. Prisoners and Sicario tarted up their junky, airport paperback plotting with ponderous, meditative baloney that somehow hornswoggled otherwise intelligent people into taking these silly movies quite seriously.<br/><br/>His latest, the rapturously overpraised Arrival, is even worse because it's made up almost entirely of borrowed parts that don't fit together. Working from a novella by Ted Chiang, Eric Heisserer's screenplay swipes the premise of The Day The Earth Stood Still, then adds a little bit of The Martian plus the worst parts of Gravity and Interstellar before finally going all Tree Of Life in a forehead-smacking finale.<br/><br/>Kicking off to the tune of Max Richter's ""On The Nature Of Daylight"" (the classical equivalent of ""Bad To The Bone"" or ""Born To Be Wild"" as far as hacky, overplayed music cues go) Arrival stars Amy Adams as a linguistics professor summoned to help try and translate when twelve enormous, unidentified hovering objects suddenly appear one morning over a dozen different countries. Since this is a Hollywood movie in 2016, Adams also has to be mourning the death of her young daughter, because if the success of Gravity taught us anything it's that science-fiction isn't compelling enough on its own and we need to throw some self-help therapy sessions in with all the spaceship stuff.<br/><br/>Adams is teamed with a mathematician played by Jeremy Renner, whose greatest gift as an actor I'm beginning to think is his uncanny ability to seem miscast in a wide variety of roles. They're working for some grumbly, angry military guys played by Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg, which threw me off a bit because Whitaker is doing such a bizarre, unexplainable accent that for a while I thought he might be one of the aliens. The better parts of the film involve Adams and Renner attempting to parse our visitors' ink-squiggle shorthand, ginning suspense out of translation troubles, as when the word ""weapon"" gets swapped with ""tool."" (This is the kind of movie that makes you want to go home and read the book it was based on.) Naturally, none of these hostile, bickering countries want to share what they're learning about the gargantuan eggplant emoji in their skies, which of course almost leads to the end of the world. Arrival makes an impassioned plea for the necessity of global cooperation while quite hilariously never straying from the perspective of its two white, American movie stars. This is a film about a worldwide crisis that can't be arsed to leave Montana.<br/><br/>Spoiler etiquette precludes much further discussion, save perhaps that the heavily telegraphed twist struck this reviewer as barmy nonsense. (It's something my friend, the great critic Ali Arikan would call ""a dud."") But it gives Villeneuve an excuse to crank the Richter music again, ramp up the cross-cutting and indulge in some terrible Terrence Malick karaoke as Adams recites pretentious narration while a child runs through fields of grass. As far as spawning soulless aesthetic imitators goes, I think it's now safe to say that The Tree Of Life has done more damage to the American cinema than anything since Pulp Fiction."

But I was disappointed - for me, this was ""Close Encounters Of The Slow And Boring Kind"" with a lack of entertainment value and a plot that was overly cerebral and rather opaque. <br/><br/>I'm sorry to reach this conclusion since French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve fashioned a brilliant work in ""Sicario"" and there is much to admire in his latest film including striking cinematography by Bradford Young, an atmospheric score from Jóhann Jóhannsson, and an excellent performance from Amy Adams as a brilliant linguist who decodes the aliens' complex language. <br/><br/>Ultimately the problem is the story-line which simply does not make sense and lacks narrative pace.

But it all gets sunk because the story makes absolutely no sense.<br/><br/>How anyone can call this film a masterpiece is beyond me. The concept is interesting but the execution is clichéd, sappy and nonsensical. There are so many plot holes with the ending. I get that the power given to Amy Adams' character by the aliens is more or less retroactive, meaning that she had it all along because it's beyond time itself. So she's had visions of a daughter she hasn't had yet. She doesn't think this is the least bit odd? And she hasn't had visions of anything else like the aliens coming down, or Jeremy Renner being the father? That's convenient... there's a great many contrivances but the biggest problem I have with this film is that it suggests that a vision of the future can create itself out of nothing and the fact that you've seen it lets you make the exact choices needed to fulfill it. I'm talking specifically about the scene where she calls the Chinese general which is an absolute paradox. Precognition can't allow you to see futures that couldn't possibly exist. And how would precognition help humanity unite or help the aliens whatsoever? There are a great many examples in popular fiction that show that knowledge of the future can be a curse rather than a blessing. And who would get the powers? Would governments decide? Would rival countries use precognitive powers to wage war with each other? Imagine a whole world full of people who could all see the future, it would be chaos. <br/><br/>Then there's the sappy melodrama, all the evil military guys pointing their guns at Amy Adams while she tries to save the poor aliens from being blown to smithereens, it just comes off as hugely clichéd that she's the only one doing the right thing while everyone else tries to hold her back, and by the way how did they know for sure they could even destroy the aliens? Wouldn't such an advanced race have some sort of defensive shielding? This is never mentioned. And what were they doing behind those glass walls for month anyhow? How were they sustaining themselves? <br/><br/>And what is the lesson to be learned at the end of the film? Humans don't really learn to co-operate and communicate better. She simply uses the power to cheat humanity's way to better foreign relations. So not only is it a cheat towards ideas of precognition, it cheats the entire premise of the movie away. And then she learns that maybe changing the future isn't for the best and that she should let it happen even if she knows it will end in pain? Isn't that against the premise as well? And what does her future with her husband and kid have to do with anything anyhow except to create a needlessly emotional ending? And then there's Jeremy Renner's line at the end: ""Let's make a baby."" Seriously?? This movie is an enormously pretentious pile. Do not waste your time."

"andrewcreer","2","11","20","24 March 2017"," Prepare To Sit and Wait.... and Then Wait.... News Flash: More Waiting.
","Yes, I know I know - everyone loved this movie. Except me. Here is why.<br/><br/>This movie is perfectly described by one of it's scenes: Amy Adams and a crew of scientists approach the giant alien shard (we've been waiting for them to enter this spaceship for about forty long minutes). They approach, they enter, we wait.... and it cuts to them AFTER THEY TALK TO THE ALIENS. That scene describes everything I feel about this film: waiting and waiting for something remotely interesting to happen, and then right when that life-changing moment is supposed to happen - it doesn't. Arrival simply falls short.<br/><br/>Arrival is boring. That is the most simple way I can put it. It really tries to be interesting; we watch and wait as Amy Adams attempts to recreate the Miracle Worker with misty ink shooting octopus creatures playing the role of Helen Keller. We trod along as this ""brilliant"" team of scientists hold up cue cards to the most dull race of aliens to ever exist. ""Wow! Now we know how they say the words ""Swiss Cheese"" with their wobbly ink designs! We're learning so much!"" Meanwhile you sit in the theater, wanting to scream in the faces of the creators and actors of this film, ""We don't care! Please dear Lord, something happen! Please!"" However, your cries do not help you as you endure yet another round of deep mouth breathing from Amy Adams and a screechier version of the score from ""Pacific Rim"". <br/><br/>The simple retort from people who LOVE this movie is, ""You probably just didn't get it."" Here's the thing: I got it. The problem is, after two hours of pure torture - the movie has a CRAAAZZAAYYY TWIISSTTT WHHOOAAAHHH! There are two major problems with the ""twist"": Firstly, the elements that the twist introduce poke so many holes in the story that it drove me insane sitting in the theater. Second off, by the time the twist is introduced - you don't care because you've just been sitting here watching alien translators for two whole hours - GAH!<br/><br/>Arrival tried to have an ""Inception effect"" on people. The creators wanted the viewers of this film to leave with their minds blown. What they forgot, is Inception had very awe inspiring plot twists and features AND was highly entertaining. Not only that, but in all honesty - the twist in this movie makes little to no sense. And yes - I UNDERSTAND THE TWIST, it just isn't a good one.<br/><br/>What I can sum this review up with was my reaction (in theaters) to when Jeremey Renner literally said the words, ""Let's make a baby."" I laughed out loud. The funniest part: those words were the most interesting of the entire film. This movie tries too hard. It isn't deep or revolutionary. It is simply a bore."

I need more vocabulary and synonyms for cheap, shallow, pointless. I get that the writer tried to include quantum theories of time past and present as all available simultaneously (John Archibald Wheeler's ideas. Professor Wheeler was Richard Feynman's adviser), however the author of the script just muddled the theory or didn't really understand it. It's a dog's dinner of a movie. Skip it."

","I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. Oh, I get the movie, but what I do not understand is how this movie was so highly acclaimed. Was it because we had an alien movie devoid of mass destruction? Surely we've seen that before.<br/><br/>Some aliens that look like giant hands in which they use their fingers as feet have parked their hover crafts in various places throughout Earth. Of course, the U.S. was one of their parking spots (you can't leave us out). The military engages these visitors and wants to know their purpose but they can't communicate with them. In steps Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a professor and language expert (which is weird because the aliens make animal-like noises yet the U.S. grabbed a human language expert instead of an animal biologist or even an animal trainer). The bulk of the movie is then spent trying to establish communications with these odd creatures.<br/><br/>The film is so pretentious and esoteric. We have to watch the movie interminably drag on with Louise trying to forge a bond with the extra-terrestrials. While the cliché military does its cliché job of following cliché directives, the sensitive and astute Louise is there to make a break through that no one else can.<br/><br/>These beings are so advanced and so intelligent yet they can't clearly communicate their demands. Arrival moves so slow and intertwines exposition in there that leaves you wondering what--if anything--it has to do with the main story. I finished watching the movie feeling completely vacant and void of any emotion about it besides indifference at best and a mild disgust at worst. Arrival did nothing for me. It wasn't thought provoking, it wasn't innovative, it wasn't even entertaining. Yes, it took itself very seriously and I don't know why. I think the movie Abyss and E.T. did far better jobs of bringing us aliens to teach us lessons."
"ghigau","2","11","20","21 February 2017"," The director is just trying to be smarter than the rest of us
","If the communication of the concept and the story were cohesive, the director would not have had to obscure it with noise and a loud music track. Think of a conversation in club music. No one has to be articulate because no one can hear. If he wants us to think he is a genius, he could do a clearer job of it. Think of the star who speaks with a British accent even if born in New Jersey. The point becomes affectation instead of film making. It is a bit like when we all grokked stuff without even knowing what that term really meant. We were brilliant enough to understand things simply by saying we understood them intuitively. Of course, we really did not understand them, or we could have been articulate about it. Ditto this film."

Arrival is one of the worst, poorly thought out, stupid alien films I've ever seen. I was appalled at the horrible CGI of the fake helicopters. My intelligence was insulted by the superior yet inept communications of the aliens. Why did no one think to show these guys a video? Really? a dry erase board? That's the best communication idea we have to share with an advanced alien race? This film doesn't have any deep meaning behind it, there's no 'leave it up to the viewer' interpretation. There's nothing that isn't completely pedantic, spelled out and spoon fed to the masses and nothing that brilliant or that isn't predictable either. I don't know why this film is so popular. There's nothing enlightening about language in this film. Inglorious Basterds had more incite to language and communication that this film. I honestly don't see any draw here. Is this for people that don't normally like SciFi? That have no concept of what a believable alien contact film might be like? Close Encounters is more plausible than this horrible representation. I can't imagine anyone would actually want to sit through this film more than once. It could have easily been edited down by 30 minutes and still conveyed its (weak) message. I find it difficult to believe that this is the same director of Sicario. Boo for the public having such low standards in movies."

","I can't believe the high ratings on this movie. It took me three sittings in order to get through it. This is one of the slowest moving movies I have ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>So much time wasted on things such as, Amy Adams holding up a white board with ""See Ian Run"" written on it, while Ian is running in the background. It had already been established that they were using a white board to teach them words, was it really necessary to show us crap like that? There was also an insane amount of time wasted on the aliens various circle smoke language. We got to see circle after circle with minor changes, and oh my god it was slow.<br/><br/>They could have had a decent movie if they shortened this to about 15 to 20 minutes. Heck, the first 20 to 25 minutes could have been cut down drastically. We really did not need to see Amy Adams in her classroom so many times, and the army (Forest Whitaker) showing up only to say they will not take her to the space ship, but end up taking her to the space ship anyways.<br/><br/>Did I mentioned that this movie is SLOW.<br/><br/>Anyways, someone needed to warn others about this movie. The crazy high rating on IMDb is a trick. I would give this movie a 2 just for some of the effects. At least you know what you are getting into now, so the choice is yours on whether to watch it or not."

","Went to see Arrival and could not wait to arrive at my home. The first hour is all chopped up, maybe filmed that way or just bad editing. Jeremy Renner was not bad for the little lines he had, Amy Adams who had the leading roll was very flaky and maybe belongs on TV than silver screen. This is a first Contact movie and there are many better ""First Contact"" Alien movies. The scrip was a very recycled one at best. My question is, who decided this was the Sci-Fi movie to dump millions into? Out of all the Sci-fi scrip this was the one; did that person even like Sci-fi? Chopped apart and boring. Maybe Hollywood should look at the Crowd funded movie Iron-Sky; that was a fun cult movie done for just a few Million, out of 10 I rated that movie 7.5 Arrival I rated just a 3--chopped apart and boring. Wait for this movie to go to Netflix."
"edenney01","1","11","20","19 January 2017"," One of the worst movies I've seen
","There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said in the myriad of other 1 and 2 star reviews. This movie is quite simply a complete and total waste of 2 hours. I'm an avid moviegoer, and I particularly like movies that exercise your brain as well as entertain, but this completely uninteresting, boring movie just puts you to sleep. I'd liken it to an extremely pretentious, ridiculously overpriced piece of abstract art in a gallery, to which everyone ascribes their own motivations to the artist, but in actuality was just a bunch of cockroaches walking through spilled paint and on to a canvas that was laying on the floor. If you want to watch a couple semi-visible squid-like finger puppets stand in fog for 2 hours while painting circular ink blots in the air, then ignore what I've said, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Now as to the absurd IMDb rating, I'm convinced that IMDb ratings have recently started being greatly inflated by some overseas company that's paid by the studios to submit very high IMDb ratings through bogus accounts, much like those companies that advertise on TV that they'll create your company's Facebook page for you, then fill it with positive reviews. Obviously that's completely dishonest, but for the moment it's legal. I reached this conclusion after recently watching another highly overrated steaming pile of feces (Nocturnal Animals), ironically also starring Amy Adams, who I happen to like. In both cases, the average rating of people who wrote out a review was substantially lower and much more realistic than the IMDb rating. With Nocturnal Animals I was so shocked that the rating could be so high while noticing so many horrible reviews, that I went through all of the reviews (there were 163 at the time) and calculated the average rating. It was a very mediocre 6.3, which is a number you'd associate with a so-so movie that you may or may not like, whereas the IMDb rating for it was (at the time) 7.8, a number you'd associate with a very good movie that most people would enjoy watching. I haven't taken the time to calculate the average reviewer's rating for Arrival, it's simply not worth wasting even more of my life, but again, having looked through 3 or 4 pages of the most recent reviews, it's painfully obvious that the average reviewer's rating is WELL below the absolutely ridiculous IMDb rating of 8.3, and probably in the neighborhood of 5.5 to 6.5, much like Nocturnal Animals."

","There were things about this film that I liked. It is a very well made, good looking film, filled with good performances, and I like some of the themes it touches upon (time is not linear, it's circular. The question of if you had knowledge of what will happen in the future, would that affect your decisions in the current time? If Adams' character knew she would one day have a daughter who would die of cancer at a young age, would she still have her? Etc.)<br/><br/>But that being said, this is one of those movies that if I was watching this at home, I wouldn't have watched the entire film. <br/><br/>The plot is about a dozen spacecraft, which hover mere feet above various locations on earth, and attempt communication. Obviously, a translator is needed, and a majority of the film deals with their attempts to decrypt and decipher the aliens' circular language. Being a linguist myself, I found these sequences to be most interesting, as we approach their language as we would any other (German, French, Sarikol Tajik) while Amy Adams has what initially appear (to the audience) to be flashbacks, which are later shown to be flash-forwards, to her relationship, and daughter, and her daughter's cancer- related death at a young age, as Adams debates with herself if it's worth it to have a child, knowing what the child's sad fate will be. The ending seems to imply that she does decide to begin that series of events leading to her daughter, and her daughter's death, in a most selfish way. Apparently, I missed the deep, and meaningful message a lot of others got from this one.<br/><br/>The aliens seemed merely like plot contrivances, like the plot wouldn't have been much different, and the point would have still been the same, if they hadn't been there, and considering the fact they are on earth for 25 days without provoking any type of conflict, it made it obvious to me that they mean no harm, there was no plot to take over the planet, and made it obvious to me that we were in for a generic ""message"" movie, which is exactly what we get. That, and an absolutely deafening score. I'm not exaggerating, the ringing in my ears (from tinnitus) was noticeably worse when I left the film, that it was before. Speaking of leaving, this movie is two hours long, and in the final thirty minutes, I couldn't wait to leave. My mind was wandering, I was tuning in and out, I really just wanted to leave. This movie is not for me. I couldn't care about the obvious plot, or any of the characters. Quite frankly, the movie just bored me. <br/><br/>After the film finally ended, an acquaintance who, unbeknownst to me was also in there for the same showing, walked up to me and began talking to me about the film, and he didn't like it either."

It remains throughout a consistently boring and nonsense film which made me yawn a total of 20 times I think.<br/><br/>I waited a whole length of two hours for finally ""something"" to arrive that would engage me as a viewer, but the garbage kept on coming at a consistent pace! You think of a film about aliens, you think of thriller, excitement, adventure, fasten-your-seatbelts moments, but you get none of that in this piece of utter garbage!<br/><br/>I fully agree though that this was a different film, it was different for the sake of it.

But don't call it a Pentecostal Christian group. Don't even call it Christian at all. Christians have never and will never do anything like that. On the contrary, that's exactly the kind of stuff the Christians would be utterly opposed to.

","After I had initially read about the movie, I thought this was going to be an interesting film exploring the nature of another life form's communication and how different from the human way of speaking and writing it actually could be. And therefore difficult to understand. Because why do all the aliens in movies communicate with sound (which of course happens to be in the hearing range of humans) or why do they always use some form of visual script? Why do they always use the logic and grammar of human language? <br/><br/>Well, who cares. Because this turned out to be just another Sci-Fi movies filled with clichés, which could work, but due to the missing plot it was just extremely boring. Of course they also communicate with some Mumbo Jumbo language and script that somehow gets translated. How that works is not explained, our genius linguist just understands. Following that is the usual: The military guys who desperately want war, especially the evil Chinese and Russians, and a subplot with the daughter and colleague-turned-husband - the emotional love must-have, I guess. And that's all there is. The aliens just leave and leave the main character with the main feature of the language: Once you understand it, you can see the future somehow. The most interesting part of that - its philosophical and logical implications - is not even touched once. You could call that thought-provoking and intellectual, I just call it lazy.<br/><br/>Only good parts about the movie are the visuals and cinematography, which is done quite aesthetically."

I'm not too sure as I had drifted off a bit at this stage having become annoyed at the gravity reversal thing.... Of the humans, Jeremy Renner plays a physicist who doesn't physic but does exude an air of someone who would much rather be anywhere else than on the set of this unintentionally hilarious film and appears to be little more than a sperm donor. Linguist Amy Adams is brought on board to crack the communication/game show tasks. ""How?"", you ask, ""by some kind of referral to universal constants?"" Nope. By drawing on a whiteboard, shouting and pointing. Englishmen abroad have been doing this for years. ""Two pints of lager, please.. I SAID TWO PINTS OF LAGER"". Eventually the increasingly manic Amy (haunted by tediously repetitive flashback/forwards) solves the mystery, although as the squid people see all time they would have known that at the beginning. The final 'reveal' sledgehammered into the film was a depressing anticlimax, mainly because we had all guessed but also because the viewer just doesn't care by that stage. Oh and Forest Whitaker is in it. He's probably wondering why too."

Most of the movie is about humans trying to communicate with them by deciphering their weird language.<br/><br/>Up until the big revelation, I was fine with it. It was slow and mostly uneventful but was taking itself seriously and had a very captivating atmosphere. There was even tension and high stakes in the form of some countries across the world not trusting the aliens and be constantly one step away from bombing the hell out of the spaceships. If this escalates amongst those who see the aliens as allies and those who consider them invaders, it would mean the beginning of a new world war.<br/><br/>But then the revelation happens and the movie loses all its appeal. Turns out deciphering the language makes you see your future, turning the whole movie to be about fatalism. There never was any tension or high stakes because everything was supposed to happen as such. The resolution was predetermined because once the main heroine saw her future, she knew what she was supposed to do, as well as she knew everything will turn out fine while the crisis was still at large. Thanks for nothing.<br/><br/>And it doesn't stop there, no sir, it even insults your intelligence by resolving the military conflict through circular reasoning. The general who was about to attack the aliens was convinced they are harmless when the heroine spoke with him over the phone. His phone number was top secret and the reason she knew about it was because the general showed her the number in the future, so she would know it in the present. Freaking hilarious! Oh, and if you are wondering how the general was convinced she was telling the truth, it's because she told him things only he knew about. And how did our heroine know about those things? Because the same general told her in the future what to say to his present self, so he can be convicted! Damn son, that's like a free ticket out of any situation imaginable! I facepalmed so hard at this.<br/><br/>Wait, there is more. Throughout the movie, the heroine has these flashbacks where she is interacting with her daughter. It was a cheap way to make her more sympathetic to the audience, since she doesn't really have a personality other than looking worried with her mouth constantly open. Turns out those were not memories because they hadn't happened yet. They were not flashbacks, they were flash forwards to the daughter she will have, therefore she never had a life to make us care about her for who she is, compared to what she accomplishes as a plot device. And she accomplishes everything simply by finding the answer into the future, so it's all lazy and contrived.<br/><br/>Arrival boasts about making you think a lot, and I agree that it does. I was constantly wondering what kind of people would like this retarded revelation and give the movie anything higher than an average score. And here is a question the movie never bothered to explore. What is the beauty of life, if everything is predetermined and you know about them from the moment you are born? You are just a robot acting out a predetermined set of actions.<br/><br/>The movie never addresses that, because it's too busy trying to look mysterious and be in a constant state of danger when in retrospect there is none. It also explains nothing about the aliens as a species. Where do they come from, what is the threat they speak of, how do they appear and disappear in an instant? Why did they even send a dozen ships when one was enough to make the heroine decipher the language? Because it was predetermined that they needed to send 12? How about the alien that was killed in an explosion? He knew it would happen but did nothing to save himself! There is no free will! What a pile of nonsense! Another fine title for pretentious pseudo-intellectuals to touch themselves while analyzing its ludicrous plot."
"Flopublic","2","14","27","4 December 2016"," I was desperately looking for a ""departure"" sign.
","This review contains: +++++SPOILERS+++++<br/><br/>When I left the cinema I was wondering: How on earth did this movie get approved by a production company (opening credits say there were four of them involved). How was the meeting like? How would you pitch this film to a producer and point out the interesting or unique aspects of it. Because it simply does not have any! The film starts with a very short sequence which introduces our main character (had to look up her name) ""Louise"" (Amy Adams). We see her and her daughter. Shortly we learn that her daughter has a serious disease and is dying. It happens way to fast. You CAN NOT relate to these characters so fast, so the death of the girl did not really bother anyone in the audience. Then we get to the present time and ""Louise"" is a professor at a university and sees on the news that alien ships have landed on planet earth. We learn that she is an expert in linguistics and therefore can help the military to decode the alien language (firstly audio recordings, then written signs). The Colonel who wants to hire her for the job (Forest Withaker) seems to be pretty dumb because he does not understand that she cannot translate an alien language by just listening to ONE recording of an alien conversation. That one made me almost laugh. <br/><br/>She tells him that she needs to be on one of these alien ships to make a first contact. So they fly her to this one alien ship and on board of the helicopter there is ""Ian"" (Jeremy Renner). They now work together as a team and go aboard the alien vessel. The most interesting part about this is how they try to communicate with the aliens (or Cthulus. They have tentacles!). This leads to very interesting questions: How do you set up a basic communication system? What are the challenges and mistakes one can make? So they learn the sign language of the aliens and try out different methods of communicating. As I mentioned before this is actually the most interesting part about this movie. This movie wants to be so many things. An artsy independent film (Budget is 45 million dollars, so it is not too expensive). The images do remind me of ""The Tree of Life"". They tried to imitate that cinematography. Especially the ""red haired mother plays with her daughter in the sunlight"" scenes. But as a matter of fact the images you get to see are just okay. Nothing special here but also not too bad. The movie also wants to be a different ""Alien contact"" film. The problem here is: They make the same usual mistakes. They get you excited and curious. They want you to ask questions about the aliens: What do they want? Are they evil or good? How do they look like? and so on. But sadly you only get just a slight hint or just no answer at all. And this is pretty unsatisfying. <br/><br/>But you might say: ""WAIT, fellow critic. This movie is NOT about the aliens. It is about the characters."" Well yes that's what they intended to do But then I gotta ask: If the characters were so important why do they only focus on their story line in the last third of the movie? They build up everything around the alien topic and then suddenly it does not matter anymore and it is all about the main character and her +++SPOILER++ ability to see the future of her own life because she has now learned the alien language. This obviously leads to ""plot-hole city"" discussions, because she wants to teach this alien language to every human being (the reason for that involves the aliens that want to come back to humanity in 3000 years which leads to another plot-hole because you ask yourself: why didn't you come 10 years before that date. But hey its still alien logic). <br/><br/>And now to the big ""twist"" at the end: We have never seen her husband in these flashbacks that she has during the movie. Thats why I guessed that the science guy ""Ian"" would be the husband. Which is the case. It means that the sequence with her dying daughter at the beginning is actually showing us their future. ""Ian"" left her because she told him that she knew that their daughter would get this disease. He could not live with the fact that he knows what his daughter will be going through and still look at her like ""You are all good. Not close to death at all."" That's the only time I had felt a connection to his character. I could understand why he went away. Other than that he is (like the whole movie) a pretty flat character that no one really cares about. ""Louise"" does not seem to have a problem with accepting her future and her daughters fate. This felt really cruel and weird to me. I would at least try to change my future or find a cure for the daughter. <br/><br/>This film wants to be a different and artsy-indie movie but fails to achieve that. The characters lack depth, the message at the end basically is ""would you live your life exactly as planned even if you knew that your future would be negative?"". This is not a really deep, life changing message (even if some enthusiastic user reviews tell you the complete opposite and are crazy enough to compare this movie with masterpieces like ""2001"" and so on). In the end I just can say that I have a ""meh"" feeling for this movie. It is not good, but it is also not really bad. There is nothing (beside some set design things) that I would call ""worthy to remember"" or special."

","The trailers for this movie made it look like it was going to be some awesome action sci-fi film. The trailers made it look like they were worried about the aliens attacking them so they needed to figure out how to understand the alien language in order to save earth. But then something happens and the aliens think that they are being attacked by the humans, so then the aliens attack. That is what the trailers looked like to me, my family, and all my friends. But that's not what this movie was. <br/><br/>So many things don't make any sense about this movie. <br/><br/>The only thing that was good about this movie was the two main characters learning how to understand the alien language.

"ravenosa","3","10","18","6 October 2017"," Mindless sci-fi movie relying on editing cheat for ""twist""
","The ""sci-fi"" part of the story is fairly irrelevant considering they don't really explore any of the ideas presented in the movie; <br/><br/>1) We are given ""flashbacks"" throughout the movie (but they turn out NOT to be flashbacks). ANY person who has a history of watching movies will be familiar with these edits; show a moody person with some sort of past, ""flashbacks"" of a son, of Jeremey Renner, would all lead any person to think these are scenes from the past (deceased son, failed marriage?). They aren't - but it doesn't really matter in context to the story.<br/><br/>2) The aliens know something about the future which requires understanding of an alien language. Apparently figuring out this language allows you to see the future. Conveniently for the filmmakers, they never tried to explore the whats/whys behind her newfound ability and how her learning a language can give her such a special skill. I've learned non-linear things before - never saw the future because of it.<br/><br/>3) There is also talk that something horrible happens in the future which requires the cooperation of earthlings to solve. Instead of seeing any hints at what this disaster may be, we are only privy to scenes of an Asian politician dancing with his wife.<br/><br/>Really, not ANY meat on this bone.

"alexawignall","1","10","18","22 August 2017"," Plot holes you could drive a bus (or an intergalactic spaceship) through
","Major spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Bought this film on DVD while on holiday as a treat. It was not a treat. I was pretty disappointed with a cliché ridden unsatisfactory film.<br/><br/>The film has a oft-told premise: Aliens arrive, humanity panics, what do they want? We struggle to communicate, there are misunderstandings, the aliens are not what they seem (start good, end bad or vice versa), some terrified humans attack the innocent aliens by mistake. We have seen it all before in many movies.<br/><br/>This one however thinks it is doing something different, something unique. The production team spent most of the DVD extra documentary congratulating themselves on how original they have been. I did not see much originality at all. There were clichés throughout - scientists squabbling about their specialities, Russians killing their experts, the inscrutable Chinese , the idiot Americans, the aliens that look like an Earth animal (in this case squid).<br/><br/>There was also a few plot holes where people act differently to all common sense or how we all know the world works. The military do not and have never made arbitrary decisions about diplomacy without someone from the government being involved (whatever country), and yet the soldiers (and not particularly high ranking ones) seem to be the ones in control of all decisions.<br/><br/>Louise the linguist discovers non linear time. She sees her daughters death in the future. She knows when it is going to be, and why, and yet we get the scene where the doctor gives her the news - but she already knows doesn't she? Why is she upset and shocked? Time paradoxes like this can ruin films.<br/><br/>The fact that Louise goes ahead and has her daughter knowing her fate also makes no sense. She appears to make no attempt at all to save her using gene therapy or other method, or have a different child entirely.If I was her I would have not had a relationship with Ian, the physicist at all. I suspect his genes or the combination of the two are to blame. Have a baby with someone else. Or have your own genes tested. Don't have a child at all. Having a child that is going to die a painful death before they are adult seems cruelly selfish to me. <br/><br/>What is the purpose of foreknowledge if it makes no difference at all. Indeed, what is ""the gift"". How is it going to help humanity or the Heptapods? If the Heptapods see all of time, then how come they cannot communicate with us straight away, or in 3000 years do they never bother to learn our language? Lazy."
"omega_work","6","10","18","6 August 2017"," Long... slow arrival
","Arrival was highly praised, making it one of the few movies to hit Netflix that I was actually looking forward to.<br/><br/>The opening scene was done really well, one of those ""Up""-esc sad openings, with Amy Adams as Louise, watching her daughter grow up and then die of cancer.<br/><br/>Now in the present (or past) day, Louise is a language teacher, and we learn that the Earth has been invaded by aliens. We learn this by a series of news shows which were mixed to have very quiet, almost inaudible sound. Not for dramatic tension but so that the filmmaker could try to startle you by suddenly having a loud blaring horn go off.<br/><br/>The next half hour of the movie felt like it was being obnoxiously slow, as if to build atmosphere or something. They clearly did not learn from the failures of such films as the first Star Trek movie, that slow sci-fi is only superior in being more boring.<br/><br/>The aliens begin to come into view through a haze and they suddenly cut away from it as if taking pride in being its cinematic cockteasery.<br/><br/>The moment it cuts directly to is directly after the encounter - skipping over it, surely to beg the question ""what happened""? and leading us to suspect that we will find out why everyone looks so shocked at a more dramatic time albeit in a less suspenseful way.<br/><br/>But instead the story just continues on. To me this took away some of the drama because all of the people acting traumatized by this experience were not behaving in a way I could relate to considering that the film is assuming that they experienced pretty much exactly what the audience did.<br/><br/>The next scene was a bit of a head-scratcher for me too... Having not been able to begin a verbal dialogue with the aliens, Louise decides that the next logical step is to have what she calls a ""visual aid"" by showing it the written word ""Human"". To me, she as a human being would be a better ""visual aid"" than the written word. But I guess I was wrong because this prompts the alien to start creating text of its own. How stupid must all these smart people have felt when all they had to do was show the aliens an English word they had no way of understanding.<br/><br/>Now that they have finally opened the lines of communication, this logically leads to the Colonel being angry at Louise for reasons that don't really make sense, but it allows her to go on a speech about kangaroos.<br/><br/>The scenes that follow are somewhat interesting as they try to learn to communicate, but it gets old pretty fast; it reminded me of the Legend of Graystoke and being bored to tears with watching Tarzan learn English. I wanted to see him swinging through trees, and in Arrival - a story about an alien invasion - I wanted to see something actually happen.<br/><br/>It becomes very clear that the author has a great interest in language and communication, and in the narration explaining the language the film is at its best. Unfortunately, the film slides into the all too predictable ""race against time"" cliché.<br/><br/>The aliens send a message that translates to ""weapon"" which apparently the Chinese have also learned to decipher - probably written in to add to the race against time, but instead it sort of renders all of the scenes where Louise was learning the language virtually pointless since apparently several others have done the exact same thing.<br/><br/>With about half an hour left in the movie I had figured out where the story was going. It's interesting but it probably wouldn't have been as predictable if it wasn't so DAMN SLOW PACED! Suffice it to say there is a kind of odd twist that was another interesting idea, but because of the way they did it, it feels like less of a twist than having the rug pulled out from under us, because there was clearly information that was being sneakily hid from us unnecessarily, leading to the necessary lack of character development.<br/><br/>But then comes the worst part yet... something that I'm afraid requires some spoilers...<br/><br/>She learns vital information by seeing into the future to a time when she already knew the information. This kind of circular story- telling is one of the laziest kinds!<br/><br/>Now I did like the fact that the theme of non-linear time was reinforced by the structure of the film. What I don't like is that the flashes of the future come at seemingly random times and is unclear about what brings them on - nor does it explain how she was suddenly able to phone a Chinese cell phone when we were told that all global communication systems were down.<br/><br/>I'm sorry of this is a ""spoiler"" but the way they hid the all too obvious revelation of who Hannah's father was was almost insulting.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film is an interesting attempt but is in many ways lost potential."

","These were certainly some strange aliens. They were so pale and washed out they had to work in darkened rooms because even the artificial light would have burned them. Whenever they were frightened, or needed to think hard, their tiny noses ceased to function and they had to breathe through their mouths. Their voices were so weak they couldn't speak above a whisper, even when trying to communicate through glass partitions or during important, intense meetings. They were all absolute slaves to their clocks and could not stop maneuvers even when the experts needed a few more minutes.<br/><br/>I heard so many people call this a sci-fi for smart people. Really? Other than a few brainy quotes thrown out in the beginning, it was a boring, romance movie with such trite statements as ""He wouldn't leave your side until he knew you were okay."" I wont spoil the ultimate message but it reminded me a little of Rodney King's famous remark after the LA riots."
"lxzaw","1","10","18","9 June 2017"," Less entertaining than a poorly performed root canal
","First of all, I am not at all into shoot-em-up space flicks, and appreciate the cerebral kind. That is what this film came nowhere close to being. Insufferably pretentious, devoid of any really stimulating content, and paiiiiiiinfully slow paced to the point that I'm surprised I made it to the end at all. I've had root canals that were more entertaining.<br/><br/>It's really hard to figure out who the creators thought their audience was. Sci-fi fans will be disappointed, especially male viewers. It's strictly a chick flick. But chicks who look for flicks rarely would go to see a film billed as sci-fi in the first place. Men take warning: this film is a date killer. It's depressing as hell and mating will be the last thing on your date's mind after seeing this. Your genes will die with you.<br/><br/>I'm a research biologist and a linguist, so I know that I have to suspend disbelief when watching even the best sci-fi, and am generally able to and enjoy the film nonetheless. I wasn't able to do that with this film. The linguistics was all totally hilarious BS of the worst sort, and the scientist never did anything remotely resembling science at all.<br/><br/>The fault is entirely in the abysmal writing, or, rather, a very feeble attempt at writing. Can't fault the actors, although the lead was a bit monotonous and grating after a while, and the child actress was horribly annoying. The whole mother-daughter story had more sap than Vermont and New Hampshire combined.<br/><br/>It's not even worth discussing effects and such because, with such a badly written story, they were totally wasted and of no significance to the experience of the film.<br/><br/>Unforgettable only because it was so exceptionally bad.

I found myself mouthing dialogue seconds ahead (It wasn't meeting them. It was meeting you) and hoping against hope there would some unforeseen twist like the alien being the father of the little girl though that's a science fiction cliché. Didn't anyone reading the script find themselves thinking they've seen this movie before? <br/><br/>How many movies have been made where the brave voice in the wilderness can't get anyone to listen to them before mob gets out their guns and start shooting? Will she get through to the Chinese boss before the authorities have her shot? Gee, will Lassie get the townsfolk to understand that Timmy fell down the well? <br/><br/>The director must have kept telling Amy Adams to tone it down because she never really does more than act pensive as she is made more and more aware of what the key is. You'd have thought it was every day that she met some aliens and saved the world.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner plays a physicist though he could have been playing a travelling anvil salesman and it probably wouldn't have changed a single word of his dialogue. If he did any real physics in the movie I must have blinked as it went by.<br/><br/>And whose idea was it to cast Forest Whitaker? What a waste of talent. He probably didn't have to memorize any lines because it was obvious what he had to say.

","It's been a progression of the issue. In the movie Gravity (2013) she saves her life because she got into a Chinese spaceship. The Martian (2015) wouldn't have made it hasn't it been by the Chinese (divine) intervention. Now Arrival (2016) at the end they just get rid of the aliens and start praising China. China was the main issue all along the movie. How China was moving it's forces to stop the aliens. How China was reacting. And at the end, it was a call to China what stopped the war. Maybe the fact that China is buying half of Hollywood is just a coincidence. If the Sci-Fi movies are going to drift toward China propaganda I do not see a very bright future for the genre. Unless they rely on Chinese people to watch them. But with China restrictions on what can you watch and what can you not, I sincerely wouldn't go down that road. The music gets annoying at the end. Too many violins. And too many flashbacks to actually nothing. Probably the book the movie is based upon, ""Story of Your Life"" would make it more understandable. The movie is full of clues. But they point to nothing. It is just an exercise on flashback technique. Watching your lawn grow it is quite more exciting. And less expensive."

I'll buy that.<br/><br/>A brilliant multilingual linguist, apparently, Louise tries to communicate with the aliens without actually speaking with them. At this point I said, ""This is a stupid movie."" She then uses a white board to write, as if the aliens could read human languages, but continues not to speak with them.

","Why do so many of these so-called serious sci-fi movies have ridiculous setups, assumptions, and stereotypical responses to all-but-telegraphed scenes? I was really hoping Amy Adams would hold up a sign that read ""You: Our future calamari"". Let's start with the problems: 12 spaceships land all over earth and everyone's given a permanent work holiday...like life just suddenly stopped because 12 overpriced (hey, they're imported!!) fuzzy pickles situated themselves over future Whole Foods locations? Don't people still need food, hospitals, education, etc? Life can't simply stop waiting for Whole Foods to place a UPC on the spaceships. Next: Any alien ship that can suspend gravity and travel through space is going to have vastly superior technology to our own; plus the aliens wouldn't have landed if they were the least bit worried about the Earth's existing weaponry. Duh! You really think guns and bombs pose any worry? When did Neil Blomkamp become the director? So, we have a military know-nothing direct the language interaction program and call the shots? Not likely. As though there's anything to ""give away"" to these aliens. Lastly, any species enabled with space faring ships won't have too many problems with basic communication...I know that's a grand assumption but, really. The whole approach to ""teaching"" the aliens wasn't much more sophisticated than training my neighbor's one-eyed dog. Piloting spaceships across the void requires lots and lots of incredible technology AND communication (certainly between the spaceships). Lastly, this whole idea of time travel and time distortion as being a necessary component of ""teaching"" humankind to interact is surely a stretch into the absurd (though this didn't stop many other movies from doing this, such as Interstellar). Oh, I should also mention that HP and Epson are running a special on squid ink this month in case any of the 12 ships are running low."

Miraculously, she is able to turn circular blobs into English sentences.<br/><br/>There is a lot of jumping back and forth from present to past to present again and, in the end, what's assumed to occur in a chronological order, has occurred in a different sequence from what the audience is led to believe. The last quarter of the movie is rather confusing in this regard. <br/><br/>The military operation at the site of the U.S. alien ship is poorly managed. Our civilian heroine manages to thwart global disaster by calling the Chinese general on a sat phone she confiscated from a CIA operative on the post. A significant keynote in the movie, yet we are deprived of the contents of the conversation. I won't even get into how she manages to steal the phone, call the private number of the general, speak Mandarin to him, and in that one sentence, convince him to halt his aggression toward the alien ship.

","Like many, I enjoy a good sci-fi yarn - serious or light - I'm not bothered, but the one thing that is required is either a belief in the story (CE3K) or total disbelief (Mars Attacks) - Unfortunately, this movie takes itself so seriously, but delivers so poorly, that it becomes unintentionally laughable. I will summarise where I feel this movie went so wrong.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>Which army would waste an army General's time in flying to a linguist's house rather than sending a less senior operative? You can not expect any linguist to listen to a 15 second series of alien grunts and moans on a Dictaphone and expect them to immediately translate them. The UFOs are revealed too early to build any anticipation. Louise meets her future husband on the army camp - where his job as a physicist is to do no physics, but to interpret some alien language (which should be her role) - otherwise he just follows her back and forth into the ship saying nothing. In CE3K the concept of communication was explored through universal physical consistencies: light, sound, movement. Writing Arabic letters on a baby white board with a marker pen would be meaningless to an alien, just as someone writing Chinese letters would not be understood by another human that doesn't speak the language. It is also expected that the aliens presumably aren't confused by the fact that the UFOs in China/Russia etc will be seeing different alphabets. For Louise to assume the aliens have names just because they squirt when she says ""Louise"" or ""Ian"" is laughable for the USA's best linguist. Humanity's first experience of superior intelligent life is handled entirely by the military in a field in Montana. In CE3K, the military were present - only to keep the public away - the bosses were the government civilian project team as it should, and would be. When the news announcer proclaims that China is going to attack the ships, and that Russia and Sudan are following suit, I nearly choked on my tea, Sudan! Sudan? Hmmm, let's see -which countries in the world don't we like right now? The use of political propaganda in these Hollywood movies is just too painful. Besides,... Sudan? Attacking a spaceship over 1500 ft tall with no knowledge of its defence/weapons systems? Has Sudan even got an army worth the name? How about South Sudan or Assad? The aliens want the humans help in 3000 years - yet they travelled to 2017 when we have no technology to even understand their request... and could possibly forget about it in 3000 years - that's if the aliens had even bothered to convey what that help might be!<br/><br/>etc...<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a shower...it knew what it wanted to say, but couldn't work out how to say it.

So when I see something as idiotic as this I leave the cinema full of regret at the wasted opportunity. It's hard to talk about the film without giving away key plot points so I'll be general.

We also get the oft repeated cliché about certain aspects of the military. Perhaps it is true that the military are that stupid but I prefer to think not. Good acting cannot save silly ideas and the premise of this movie was just that. Silly. But worse the pseudo science was also dumb. The fundamental appeal of SF for me has always been ideas.

So many questions to ask simply about the Squidleys. First comes to mind is they are obviously much more advanced then earthlings. They obviously have been studying us for some time (they say we have something for them at some point in the future). It would seem they would know how to communicate with us just as humans learn to communicate with the animal world. When we pay attention to our pets we usually know what they want, and how they communicate. I just don't see how this lack of communication in the movie can exist when these advanced aliens have the vastly superior technology to arrive on earth in incredible crafts and have defied gravity at the same time. Then the actress who plays the linguist. I am sorry but booooring. I mean, she tells the Squidleys she is Louise?? I mean, geez Louise, do you think they even give a hoot?

","People are hailing this as Villeneuve's greatest, but IMHO his masterpiece is Incendies. Prisoners and Enemy are also excellent. I truly felt deeply for the characters in those earlier movies - based on those other flicks, I consider Villeneuve to be a genius. <br/><br/>What happened with Arrival? I don't know. Perhaps sci-fi is not his forté. Perhaps he was hampered by a book that was difficult to transform into a visual work of art. But mostly I found the movie to be embarrassingly pretentious. <br/><br/>There are attempts to create suspense through loud music, but they just fall flat. The alien ships are uninteresting and not particularly threatening. The movie also could have been several minutes shorter - why did that boring helicopter ride take so long? That was just one example of directorial conceit. <br/><br/>All the characters aside from Amy Adams are totally incidental and could be replaced by anyone - what a waste of Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker.<br/><br/>On the positive side - at least we see some different looking aliens, a vast improvement over the cliché tropes from the past 35 years. Amy Adams gives a sensitive and moving performance (aside from the usual screen rule for actors to have their mouths open in awe half the time, a requirement she handles better than most mouth breathers).<br/><br/>Overall, Arrival comes off as a sophomoric attempt to show us how we all have to work together to save our world.

Now to the movie itself. Denis Villeneuve made his worst movie to the date, and I'm sure he knows that. But hey, maybe he just realized he needs a pension fond. Can't blame a guy for looking out for his financial future. True art can wait. This movie borrows heavily from yet another brain dead pseudo-SF""masterpiece"", Interstellar. Heavy narration throughout the movie and time back/forward-flashes of a main character's family moments, and practically steals the aliens from The Mist (Steven King novel), hope Steven got his share of the pie as well. The movie's resolution is so dumb I just have to congratulate the scriptwriters on their breakthrough in the realm of yet unexplored stupidity. Just imagine a language that after you learn to write it lets you see your entire future."
"claudiu737","2","9","16","25 November 2016"," No way this is a good movie
","Pseudo science fiction movie, that probably will end up on no value box soon. You can tell the original story was completely different only to be butchered by hilarious dialog and situations. Could have been a beautiful story like Contact (which the makers probably aimed at) but instead it only insults ones intelligence. You can also see the lack of budget everywhere - that would have not been a problem had the story been strong. This movie is a collection of stitches. Screenplay is week, characters week, connection with the audience missing, misleading, pretend and wanna be deep movie. Many of the situations have conflicting logic, the atmosphere is totally missing. Cinematography absent, screen play looks heavily edited and most of the time you feel it was written for or by a twelve year old. It will always be a mystery why Hollywood always elects the simplistic path when telling a story. It would be beneficial for everyone to just make a good movie, a good story and the audience will love it - instead of trying to please a public that seems lower and lower in standards.No way I am going to see this over and over again like the trailer hopes. What a joke."
"wohlforth-54033","4","9","16","12 November 2016"," Average for a sci-fi blockbuster, but that is a low bar
","The promotional materials for this film imply a highly original hard sci-fi plot, focusing on the fascinating hypothetical process of establishing communication with aliens - the topic of extensive real-world research. That is not what this film is about. In fact, it is blatantly anti-intellectual, with core problems being mostly being solved through gut feeling or the intervention of mysterious forces. Beyond what is revealed in the trailer, there is very little that is original in this film. Just about every cliché in the alien contact genre appears. The same tired stereotypes of gender, race and profession all show up unquestioned. The film relies heavily on the same brand of mysticism that Interstellar and similar films always seem to use to tie up loose ends. I will say that many of the visuals were quite stunning. Some of the first shots of the alien artifacts are really beautifully composed. I wish they had put that much thought into the story. It was disappointing to see such an interesting concept be so poorly executed."

","An awful movie from start to finish. The story could have been told so much better even though it is clichéd, tired and simply dreadful, but as it is the movie is disappointing and very badly written. The only thing that remotely saves this movie from the metaphorical 'dog pile' is the acting, which to be fair is very good. With the big names involved that's no surprise. The sad truth is that the movie is so bad it's almost an insult to the actors involved. The entire story-line for this film could have been sketched out in 5 minutes on a scrap of paper, and indeed that's actually how it comes across. I cannot for the life of me stress any more strongly just how poor, old, boring and completely monotonous this movie is. There is not one shred of anything new or fresh. It's terrible."
"adamwilliams-97305","1","15","30","19 February 2017"," I am literally worse off for seeing this
","This was literally the weakest film I have ever seen, and I joined IMDb just to write this review. <br/><br/>Arrival is an insult to any smart moviegoer, and a good example of the results and high ratings you will get by simply throwing a ton of money at a thin plot and disgusting script. So, this is business and movies make money - well done then.<br/><br/>But I'd rather see something memorable.<br/><br/>Arrival is basically a terrible remake of the brilliant Contact (1997).<br/><br/>This is not even in the realm of sci-fi, as the science is never attempted to be explained (thanks in part to the useless ""theoretical physicist"" character played by Renner) - Arrival becomes just another fantasy flick.<br/><br/>The cliché 'narrow minded grunt army corporal' (Whitaker) picks Adams as the foremost expert on language to communicate with the aliens, berates her when she doesn't understand the aliens - then almost immediately questions her tactics. Whitaker, y u do dis movie?<br/><br/>There is even the bit when a rogue attacks the peaceful aliens - a la 'Contact'. After which, the operation is called off and the area evacuated - though Adams is able to thwart the high security by running across a field to access the craft again.<br/><br/>Booming ""alien"" noises (War of the Worlds, 2005) for nothing more than jump-scare value and play no part whatsoever in communication.<br/><br/>On arrival to the forward base, Renner and Adams are told they will be heading up their respective emergency departments, then are immediately taken into the craft for the first 'session' - with not so much as a quick briefing on the situation!<br/><br/>Adams: ""What do the aliens look like?"" Whitaker: ""You'll see.""<br/><br/>Really?<br/><br/>Along with a multitude of sensors, they literally take a canary into the craft visits (once used in coal mines as an early warning system - ceased in 1986).<br/><br/>Renner's character is goofy and boring (he's supposed to be a top theoretical physicist). I was excited when he was introduced to the movie - But disappointingly, is used solely as Adams' love interest - but not until right at he end - and nothing else at all. <br/><br/>There are friendly ships and aliens that defy all known physics and that is the best the movie can do.<br/><br/>The only thing I found OK was that they did not use the cliché movie alien form.<br/><br/>Cheers."

","This could have been a much better movie but it is so dragged out and everything is going very slowly. No suspense at all. No entertainment. No nothing. The movie could have easily taken 30 minutes less. The idea is good but too much drama destroyed potentially interesting movie. The movie is totally forgetful and the only situation worth retelling is the part with gravity in the beginning. I do not know why there are so many good user ratings and reviews. This movie is slow, dull, dragged out and forgetful. I gave it a 4 only because it was filmed at all. I assume that those who gave it an 8 or more do not watch a lot of movies because I just can't justify the high scores with anything else. Oh yea. There might be the possibility of being on drugs while watching the movie then giving it an 8. ;)<br/><br/>To sum it up - I would not recommend this movie."

","I did not want to see this film, but it was the only thing showing first thing in the morning when I had the opportunity to get to a cinema. I'd seen the trailer and it didn't look good. I was more than pleasantly surprised. There's real emotional power in this film, borne from a strong (cerebral) script, delivered by a director in real control of the material, and a standout performance at its center. <br/><br/>Everything that can be said, has been, so I'll keep it simple. If you're a parent, this will hit you right in the gut. It's not a film for 18 year old's hoping for Independence Day style explosions. This is a film for emotionally mature people and those with half a brain. That rules out all the naysayers (mostly active in the forums).<br/><br/>Judging by the scores however, most IMDb people do have an appreciation for something stimulating and engaging, elements lacking from most superhero/remake fodder today. <br/><br/>I love Abbott and Costello movies, so really appreciated those references and the Sheena Easton gag, lost on many I assume.<br/><br/>It's not a film about special effects, but I'm really glad I saw it at the cinema. It didn't allow me the opportunity to pause it and wander off and come back to it. I was drawn in emotionally and held captive, in a particular mindset, for the duration of the story. As a parent, there were tears, I'm not ashamed to admit.<br/><br/>I hope those younger naysayers embarrassing themselves in the forums get the opportunity to revisit this film in later years and feel its true worth. I for one, haven't felt this emotional in a film for some time."

It's not a 'Kaiser Soze' lightning bolt, rather an exciting archeological find that is slowly revealed with delicate brush strokes, eventually exposing the treasure in its entirety.<br/><br/>Perhaps all of the garbage sci-fi films before did have a purpose?

Despite all of this, she triumphs! And without ever using makeup or making any attempt to be pretty. Hooray!

"arpad-1","1","8","14","19 August 2017"," terrible garbage, worst example of ""smart"" sci-fi that was ever made
","SPOILER ALERT: THIS MOVIE SUCKS HARDER THAN BILLY EICHNER AT A MALE NAIL ARTIST CONVENTION<br/><br/>I rarely, if ever, write a review, but this was so terrible that it made me so nauseated and disappointed that I had to sit down and write this review to prevent my brain from self-destructing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I believed the good reviews of this movie and thought that it was going to be a good, thought-provoking sci-fi movie. I really should have listened to the bad reviews, instead. For anybody that has a brain, an IQ above 100, and enjoys good sci-fi (and I'm not talking about CGI action stuff), you will be sorely disappointed. Everything about it was just so terrible... (""war"" in Farsi? Come. On. I'm not even going to begin listing all the things about that short exchange that made it so incredibly stupid, forced, unbelievable, and ludicrous. Seriously, she would let the opportunity of a lifetime walk out the door without at least telling him she would give it a shot, but that he was asking for the impossible and will come to realize it?)<br/><br/>I'm not going to reiterate the bad reviews, most of them hit the nail on the head. I didn't read all 1300 reviews (at the time of writing this) but here's one thing I didn't see mentioned: So the Australians have already figured out that the aliens somehow lack in understanding basic algebra but somehow have a genius grasp of complex high-level equations, yet the US hasn't even been able to take the first basic steps of communication in the same time-frame? What, did the Australians not want to share any info? Seemed like they were being pretty open with everything on Skype...<br/><br/>It would physically impossible to list all the terrible things about this movie, it would take longer than the life-span of even the oldest person that ever lived. It would also just be a complete waste of time and brain cells... I honestly have no idea how 400k voters gave this an 8. Please tell me that the Russians somehow hacked IMDb's voting system to make everybody look stupid, or that the reason it has an 8 currently is because of up- voting from people involved in making this movie, because if I start believing that the average intelligence of people is really so low that they thought this movie was that good, I'm going to try to slash my wrists with the closest object I can find.<br/><br/>For the ""smart"" sci-fi that this was trying to be, it was worse than a failure: it probably made many people less interested in watching ""smart"" sci-fi and actually putting a few brain cells to work. If you value your brain, time, and the future of humanity, do whatever you can to never give in to believing the good reviews of this movie, and do everything you can to prevent other people from watching it. I usually give the benefit of doubt to movies that I didn't like, and re-watch it a second time to make sure that I wasn't just in the wrong mood, but it definitely was not just that I wasn't in a receptive mood or thinking properly... this movie was completely and utterly garbage. It's really an utter shame, because the premise is fantastic, but the film makers dropped the ball in every way with dialog, story line, etc. I mean, seriously, the brightest minds the US could muster were so unprepared that they didn't even think of bringing a blackboard or any visual aid?<br/><br/>If you sat a group of first graders down for 15 minutes, they would have come up with better ideas. I dreaded every time the US military leader opened his mouth, and it was not because he was accurately portraying ""stupid military"" but just horrendous scripting, plain and simple. Actually, most garbage is probably more useful than this movie. The only use I can think of for this movie is to use it as an example of what mistakes future film makers should avoid making to turn a potentially fantastic movie into a horrifying disaster, or as a terrorist torture device. Maybe they've started spraying some kind of drugs like MDMA into the air at theaters? That's the only way I can think of that I would rate this movie higher than one star. The one star is just for the fact that it's a sci-fi movie with an interesting one-line summary, that's about the best thing I can say about it. It wasn't even possible to enjoy making fun of this movie while watching it, due to the severe nausea and suicidal thoughts that it induced.<br/><br/>For those people that truly voted it that high, and have at least an IQ of 130, I implore you to please watch it again, but this time really pay attention to everything. Please stop texting or talking at all, because you must have only devoted 5% of your brain to watching this movie the first time. Texting and watching a movie, and then writing a review about it, should be a punishable offense. Please, I beg of you, don't get offended by what I've said, and honestly watch it again really carefully, because you've inadvertently made this world a more dreadful place."

","The movie doesn't work on its main topic.<br/><br/>Which is not the contact with Aliens, not the helplessness of the military, not the incapability of humans to work together.<br/><br/>The movie fools the observer. It shows images of the mind of the main actor, Louise, the language specialist who will learn to communicate with the Aliens.<br/><br/>Logically, the images can't be anything else but memories from the past, where she was left by her husband, and lost her child to a rare illness.<br/><br/>And then in the end, she understands the language of the Aliens, telling her that time is not linear, and that they give humans their language to understand that they will need humanity in 3000 years.<br/><br/>But how can future be predetermined, and maybe predictable, if time is not linear? Louise can't do anything else but live what wasn't her memories, but her visions of the future.<br/><br/>I won't take that path of illogical fallacy reasoning, I recommend reading ""How to think about weird things"" Critical thinking for a new age, because in our time of information, people obviously lack the ability to handle that information with reason, to rate this movie so high.<br/><br/>The message of the movie is misleading New Age BS.

","All in all, it was an interesting film that did grab your attentions in some scenes, for example, it was interesting to see the people's reactions when they found out the news of the aliens' landings, and what they continued to do after that with the army flying over them in Jets etc. When the US army came to pick her up, it was a little bit expected, no big surprise. And when they got to the base that was beside the 'space craft', nothing very interesting happened there as well. Once they finally entered the ship, it was a little bit interesting, but nothing exciting that has you on the edge of your seat. It only got a bit exciting when they started learning the alien language and managed to start communicating with it, which also brought into view a historical perspective, on how the early settlers e.g. Captain James Cook managed to communicate with local islanders such as the Maori or Aborigines. The end was the worst of all. I was left completely confused on what on earth it was talking about. All the images from different times switching back and forth, not knowing whether it was future or past or present, and having to get your mind around the fact that none of that had happened yet, even though she'd been having those flashbacks for the entire movie, made it hard to fully understand and grasp. I personally think that the end ruined the entire movie with all its future-telling-revelations and then confusing flashbacks that were of the future etc. and was too much to wrap your head around, therefore being my reason I give only five starts. <br/><br/>My compliments to the producers and actors on their work though and set-design, animation and picture."

Its a failed attempt at even a movie because you have gigantic squids that arrive on earth and we humans spend the entire time of the movie trying to understand their message to us. The bottom line basically is the linguist tries to decipher the language and alphabet of the squids, you eventually find out that you can see into the future as you learn and decipher their language and alphabet. And this is the gift that they brought to earth and outta nowhere, swoosh, they disappear. Yes that is it! Hello aliens or giant squids... why are you here? Oh I think I deciphered some of their messages! Now I can see into the future and this was a gift they wanted to present to us before disappearing again and being able to decipher it prevented an attack on the giant squids.

","You will notice the reviews here are very divided - either you like it because it is so 'amazing' or you hate it because it is *not* a sci-fi movie as it was made out to be (as seen in the synopsis of IMDb). The so-called 'surprising end' that was mentioned by many reviewers was a downer to me. The ending twist (without giving away too much here) was essentially a personal dilemma regarding having a child or not. As you may expect - I was going for a sci-fi, looking for aliens and was confronted in the end with an apparently 'confusing tale'. I was totally disappointed. I really think that the synopsis from the film maker (and IMDb) should be more honest. They should sell the film as an personal drama with an ethical bend (because this is what it is). The so-called sci-fi elements in the film were completely incidental (and was 'light-weight' for sci-fi fans). The story could have easily been replaced by a woman touching an electrical cable and completely 'rewired' her visions about herself and her future (instead of trying to speak to the aliens, and then being re-wired by the contact). If you saw the film and came away thinking ... ""What was that?"", then I would advise you read this article - use Google search for 'How the short story that inspired Arrival helps us interpret the film's major twist' by the Verge. The give-away of the whole film why it is *not* a sci-fi movie was the reply that Amy Adams gave to her daughter - ""I made a mistake."" If you are a sci-fi fan, save your money. Go somewhere else. If you are just looking for a twist, perhaps this film will do it."

It's the attempt at implying that the story is emotionally driven that kills the interest. They are trying to catch what made 2001: A space odyssey a master piece without really working on anything interesting outside of the subtle symbolism from time to time, which is never really woven into anything else.<br/><br/>One thing you can try, explain the story to someone after the movie. You might find it difficult, not because it is heavy in content or subtle, but because the plot-twist at the end is guaranteed to make you question every bit the main character is involved in, without really extending that questioning to everybody other character, except, obviously, on very important side character that looks more like he's performing an unholy deus ex machina than really following the logic they are proposing.<br/><br/>All in all, it could have been good, even amazing, but like gravity, it's a human story pasted over an interesting idea, and not even well."

Give me a break. Then it gets even worse. Apparenty they military cannot even position the lift directly under a great big hole. They have to lift them up then move to whole lift to where the entrance is. Why not just put it underneath?<br/><br/>Why do they keep ferrying equipment back and to ? They must have cameras etc and power supplies that can last more than a few days.<br/><br/>The protection against contamination was not realistic. They had to move up to a kilometer in contaminated suits to get back to decontamination. Err I think that would have been a bit too late. Also why a second mask inside a hazmat suit ? What military don't have suits with built in communication.!!!<br/><br/>As the film progressed it degenerated into the GOOD west and the BAD East.

","'Arrival' begins well, but ends up a major disappointment after twelve huge egg-shaped spacecraft arrive on Earth and hover a few feet above the ground at various locations around the globe. Initially it takes a novel approach - instead of ray-gun battles, the world's finest linguists are corralled by national authorities to enable communication with the aliens, who resemble an octopus/elephant hybrid. Each host country competes to unravel the Octophant language, selfishly hoping to acquire advantages over rival nations. Unfortunately the meetings between extraterrestrials and linguists aboard the vessels quickly become repetitive, thereby squelching any sense of awe over humanity's first contact with intelligent life from beyond our solar system. This loss of dramatic tension becomes a serious problem as 'Arrival's' plucky heroine struggles to decipher the aliens' complex circular hieroglyphics. <br/><br/>The actors' performances are more than adequate for the material, but the narrative arc becomes increasingly predictable. As the story unfolds, it leans stubbornly upon the old Sci-Fi cliché of mankind's paranoia and xenophobia. The Earthbound military powers foolishly adopt a threatening attitude toward the ETs, who obviously possess more advanced technologies. The screenwriters deploy some equally foolish plot devices as the film charges headlong into a formulaic Hollywood cliff-hanger climax, before it winds up wallowing in sentimental hokum."

"themadmovieman","9","17","36","20 November 2016"," A powerfully intense, cerebral and exhilarating watch
","This is a very special film. A hugely unique take on first contact, Arrival is one of the most intense and cerebral experiences you've ever had at the movies, requiring full concentration, an open mind, and patience for a slow-moving, but utterly enthralling story. Featuring exceptional performances, astonishing directing from Denis Villeneuve, a near-perfect screenplay, and a mesmerising score, this is a truly exhilarating film to watch, and one that will leave you thinking and pondering long after the credits have rolled.<br/><br/>First off then, suppose the most important thing to say about this film is that you have to have your brain turned on. This is not even in the same league as the likes of Independence Day or even Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, but is instead a dark, heavy-going drama that only uses a science-fiction setting to tell a gripping and emotionally powerful story about humanity.<br/><br/>Much like all of Denis Villeneuve's films, Arrival is at times a soul- destroying experience, portraying some utterly devastating forecasts of how people around the world would deal with first contact, but that's one of the reasons that it's such an arresting watch.<br/><br/>Villeneuve himself does an exceptional job at directing this film. It's the first massive-scale project we've seen from him, but his astonishing ability to create a stunningly eerie and tense atmosphere at every single moment in this film, whether it be in the unnerving sweeping shots of the alien spacecraft, or the smaller, more claustrophobic moments centring on the human characters' efforts to deal with them, is testament to what a talent he is.<br/><br/>And that tense eeriness carries over brilliantly into every other part of the film. For me, one of the most memorable elements of Arrival was the score by Jóhann Jóhannsson. Staying effectively silent for so much of the film, Jóhannsson takes an incredibly unique and experimental approach to the music of the film, often making it appear as if it is sound coming from the real world.<br/><br/>At times, the aliens' cries and speech become pieces of musical score, adding significantly to the sense of danger and tension, which was stunning to see. At others, however, he uses some powerful instrumental tunes to heighten the drama of the characters' emotions, and although this is a film in which you can hear the score, it plays such a significant role in shaping your experience that it's a huge positive.<br/><br/>Along with the music, the performances are another key element that make this film so stunningly intense. At the centre of it all is Amy Adams, who is astonishing from start to finish. Dealing with a very complex character and story, she brilliantly powers through and portrays a huge range of emotions, from her character's crushing depression early on in the film, to her determination and strength whilst attempting to communicate with the alien beings. It's not the normal Amy Adams we know and love so much, but a far more battle-hardened and intense performance, but that deviation from her more typical roles is spectacular to watch, making this easily one of her best ever performances.<br/><br/>And finally, we come to the screenplay. Based on a short story, the writing here is an exceptional display of ingenuity and intelligence. The heavy-going and slow-paced nature of the movie becomes a virtue because of the writing, giving you as a viewer the time to think about everything that is going on and understand it deeper, whilst also taking on some incredibly complex ideas and themes and making them work almost perfectly in the context of a science-fiction film.<br/><br/>In the end, however, this film isn't so much about the aliens as it is about its human characters. The story is very difficult to talk about without spoilers, however I can say that the way the film's narrative unfolds throughout is genuinely one of the most unique and brilliant things I've ever seen, and it makes for an astonishingly powerful development of emotions towards the finale. It does require an open mind, but with that comes a truly incredible and thought-provoking story.<br/><br/>Overall, I was blown away by Arrival. A masterpiece of directing, scoring, acting and writing, it's a truly exhilarating watch that will take you on a devastating roller-coaster of emotions, but with an ingenious and utterly enthralling story that you will not forget in a long time."

","What in God's name did I just watch? This movie makes absolutely no sense. So a dozen alien spaceships show up shaped like black bars of Dove soap and the military gets college professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to translate for them? OK, so Louise spends months cracking the code of our ink-squirting aliens who resemble a cross between squids and Thing from the Addam's Family. Really? Only for a group of rogue soldiers to try and blow up the ship our protagonist is working out of and our resident aliens live in. But don't worry, our highly-advanced tentacled guests are much more forgiving than we are. Turns out, the aliens have a gift for us and actually still want us to have it even after that little stunt by a bunch of army privates. That gift turns out to be their highly-advanced language: Etch A Sketch. No kidding! What's even better is their version of Etch A Sketch can tell the future! So, now our alien flick turns into Looper? *Insert Captain Jean-Luc Picard Meme Here*<br/><br/>Are you confused yet? Anyway, trying to explain the plot and the twist from this point forward gets even harder to do, so I won't. Let's just say it doesn't help that our characters are so wooden and mostly useless. Poor Forest Whitaker and Jeremy Renner. Both try their best, but Whitaker pulls off a no nonsense colonel better than Renner does a physicist. But that's not entirely Renner's fault. They pretty much gave him nothing to do other than be a glorified translation assistant and eventual love interest of Amy Adams. Then there is the screenplay and dialogue. Dreadful! Renner's character actually named our two main aliens Abott and Castillo. What's worse is the aliens actually answered to it!!!! *Insert More Captain Jean-Luc Picard Memes Here*"

"TheLittleSongbird","7","7","12","19 September 2017"," A different sci-fi film, and a good, but divisive, one
","Despite being critically acclaimed, 'Arrival' is another one of those films that is praised to the heavens with critics but has wildly divided audiences judging from the nature of both the positivity and negativity. Though it has to be said that the positive reviewers have been far more mature than the negative ones, many of which to me being disgustingly condescending.<br/><br/>'Arrival' is a very different sci-fi film, and one can definitely see why people will love it and be moved by it as well as seeing why people will hate it and be alienated. To me, 'Arrival' is not as good as reputed and is not a masterpiece, but even if it didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least. From personal opinion there are far worse films out there that are far more deserving of 1/10, and it would be insulting to put 'Arrival' down there with them. Even if the film didn't much for me, the good things would still be acknowledged and there would be real effort to be respectful of other people's opinions regardless of agreeing or disagreeing with them rather than being insulting and inventing ridiculous and untrue conspiracy theories. Those who hated it do need to grow up and start accepting that not everybody hates this film and that those who loved it are being genuine, and no being angry at being disappointed by it is not an excuse. Coming from a younger film lover than most on this site who's autistic and disabled but those have not gotten in the way of being understanding of people's opinions, what's your excuse? <br/><br/>Back to my thoughts on the film, 'Arrival' is a meditatively paced film, and is not an action filled or jam packed with constant narrative. While this may understandably alienate viewers, neither of these are necessarily bad things especially when there are great to masterpiece films that are the same. Of the four films seen of Denis Villeneuve so far, 'Arrival' may be my least favourite, and his most polarising, least violent and most gentle, but that is just testament to how very good 'Prisoners' is and how fantastic 'Incendies' and 'Sicario' are.<br/><br/>The criticisms are understandable and am in agreement with some. It does drag in the middle act, softening and slacking too much. It does get confusing in the later stages, where things can get ridiculous and predictable.<br/><br/>Forest Whittaker and particularly Michael Stuhlbarg's characters are underutilised and underwritten with both having very little to do, the two do make the most of their roles one has to give them that.<br/><br/>However, 'Arrival' does look wonderful. This is particularly true in Bradford Young's cinematography, being fluid and its tactile quality is of sheer beauty. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed and lit, the special effects have grand spectacle and the editing is some of the best of its year.<br/><br/>Johann Johannsson's music score is another standout, it has a haunting creepiness and has a heart-pulsating and emotional beat. It not only adds a huge amount to the film, it also enhances it. Denis Villeneuve's direction is his most subtle and least hard-hitting, which is not only a good thing but the right thing, the approach he gave to 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' would have ruined an atmosphere that's the complete opposite.<br/><br/>In terms of how it's written, 'Arrival' is not perfect but it has a movingly raw emotion, thoughtfulness, subtly suspenseful mystery and gives a compelling realism to its character especially the protagonist. Likewise the story (yes there is one), with a poignant emotion and a clever and powerful, if perhaps not the most logical, twist.<br/><br/>The acting is one of 'Arrival's' best assets, all round it's very good even if some characters are better realised than others. Amy Adams in particular is astounding, she has rarely been more poignant. Jeremy Renner also underplays effortlessly.<br/><br/>All in all, divisive film but count me as one of the people who liked it but in an appreciation way than a loved it way. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"postfactworld","5","7","12","15 May 2017"," Meh
","Amy Adams is absolutely captivating, as always, to the extent she demands your attention and never, ever lets go. She is infinitely watchable. It's not genius, unless it's contrived by her. It's just her unique form of charisma, one that is to be applauded and treasured, and is worth watching any movie to see.<br/><br/>Sadly, that is most of the reason to see Arrival. The movie itself tries very hard to be mysterious, seductive, and interesting. But in the end, it fails because its philosophical and scientific kung fu is weak. Arrival utterly ignores such well-known time paradoxes as the Predestination Paradox and the Bootstrap Paradox and ultimately conspires to have you ignore common sense. To swallow the sugar-sweet ending (and you'll want to), you will have to pretend that an entirely new, completely unexplained paradigm of non-linear time is possible - one that defies reason and is passed without adequate...you know, I want to say ""without adequate"" but in truth it's without ANY explanation.<br/><br/>I couldn't pretend to believe it, and that's why I'm giving this movie 5 stars.

The last 10 minutes of the film are convincing. <br/><br/>But the 1:40 before that are uninspired to right out boring. The fantastic idea is superseded by the typical Hollywood stuff. <br/><br/>Instead of telling us a convincing personal story, perhaps even with aliens, the filmmakers decided to drown almost everything in the usual line: military investigates, scientists are summoned under their command, earth governments consider an armed conflict. This is the source of suspense and drama. Missing completely the real point.<br/><br/>This whole setup really buries most of the movie.<br/><br/>It is a tragedy to see this beautiful idea wasted that thoroughly. <br/><br/>Acting is great.

","***SPOILERS SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Thank goodness I watched this at home and could take a break after the first hour--very slow moving, like your average glacier.<br/><br/>A major portion of the movie focuses on the effort to learn to communicate with the aliens who have landed on various parts of Earth. Within what appear to be weeks or months--let's assume months, even though it's never made clear--our heroine, language expert Dr. Louise Banks, has figured out how to communicate with the aliens, who seem to communicate with a few vague sounds and a lot of dynamic visual symbols. Louise and the aliens go from exchanging a few simple symbols (the written word for human, the alien expression for who they are, etc.). A man provides a demonstration of ""walking."" And the next thing we know, Louise is talking to the aliens in short sentences, which the aliens more or less understand. And we're not just talking ""Boy eat apple""-type sentences. No, we're talking abstract concepts like ""what is your purpose,"" ""weapons,"" and so on. <br/><br/>I simply could not believe that they could crack the language code so quickly. Sorry.<br/><br/>Also, another key plot point of the movie is what appear to be Louise's flashbacks. We come to understand what these are by the end of the movie, but my, wasn't it convenient who and what she did and did not remember? And the timing of the flashbacks was peculiar. I could not buy that at some point during the entire ""mission,"" she did not look at the other character and say, ""Wait, I know you!"" Very inconsistent and unbelievable.<br/><br/>While watching this movie I had a distinct feeling that it was based on a book. (It is in fact based on a short story.) Some stories are ""mind"" stories, internally focused as much as anything else, with much or most of the story impact deriving from the state of the protagonist as he/she is perceiving and interacting with external situations. Also, some stories rely on a certain unique written style to enhance the story impact. All of this was my sense about ""Arrival""--that as a written story, it might have been quite intriguing from a mental/psychological and stylistic POV, but trying to transfer something like that to a visual medium like the big screen might have caused it to lose some of that impact. (I have not yet read the short story, so I could be wrong.) Anyway, JMO."

","I won't try getting the score down as fast as possible so therefore 3/10, the music was quite good, although it didn't match the story. But 8.1?? For this movie?? I love going to IMDb the minute I've watched a movie I hated. And the same pattern emerges every time. You have these 10/10 reviews which read like wannabee magazine reviews and you have the 1/10 honest ones.<br/><br/>The 10/10 reviews are either 1. Villeneuve fanboys -""Another masterful piece""-, 2. People who want to be movie reviewers at some magazine or 3. People who are afraid they didn't get the movie and talk in clichés on how ""moving"" and ""emotional"" it was. We can't do anything about point 1 and 2. But to the point 3 people I'd like to say: Don't be afraid, there was nothing to get here. It's pretentious (just like Villeneuve's Sicario) in a way that a lot of people get distracted by form while the substance is totally lacking.<br/><br/>In Sicario we discover that the Americans with their war on drugs are actually a huge part of the problem. Really? Wow, that's news to me. In Arrival we're distracted by a loose connection between time, language, personal life and working together as humanity. In this movie, the Americans are the peace keepers of the world, and good old China and Russia are brainless military guys who want to blow up the poor aliens.<br/><br/>There's a lot of visiting the aliens and interpreting their splashy new ink language. When I heard the aliens for the first time, I'd hire some whale researcher instead of a language professor who only speaks some Chinese at most. But she deciphers the alien language in a miraculously short amount of time and understands that they're bringing some kind of knowledge, and in return we should help them in 3000 years. With what? We will never know. The male scientist doesn't help us either, he's doing really nothing but staring at computer models without getting to a conclusion so he starts staring at our female professor. Guess what happens in the end!<br/><br/>The music was good, but it was distracting as well. The first 30 minutes I thought something evil would happen. Maybe that was the point, but the anti-climax of the entire movie was even worse because of this.<br/><br/>My biggest question after reading all these IMDb comments was: Are these 10/10 comments trolls trying to boost the movie's rating? Because I just can't believe how you fill all these plot holes by yourself?"

","Arrival. Yes, well, what can one say? The most overwrought piece of nonsense since Interstellar. Just a few quick questions. Why would a race of beings who can perceive time in a non linear fashion and travel faster than light need a race ""in 3000 years"" who can only perceive time in a linear fashion? Plus the fact she agreed for all of us to undertake the reciprocal task without any consultation. Pretty sure the leaders of the world's governments might be a little upset about her cavalier usurpation of their authority. If the aliens could experience time 'from end to end' and travel faster than light, why all the cloak and dagger about their language? Surely they could master every one of our languages and just avoid all the confusion from the get go? Why 12 ships when 1 would do? Why a race that experiences time in a non linear fashion would let a bomb into their spaceship and then wait for the very last minute to warn the linguist and the scientist? Surely they knew about it all along because they have already seen it? Why when the linguist gets taken inside their part of the ship English suddenly appears on the screen? But most of all why would the Chinese general tell the linguist, in the future, what she said and show her his ""private"" phone number like giving her instructions? He was not asking her, he was telling her from the future. Makes no sense at all unless they actually understood they are being manipulated in the time stream. The linguist was apparently not aware because the big reveal was the daughter who dies has not been born yet. Picked up on that in the 'sitting on the truck tray' scene. Then there was the wrap up question asking if one knew their whole life from end to end would they change anything. Only creatures who experience time in a linear fashion would ask that question. Aliens who could experience time in a non linear fashion would already know the answer. The most annoying thing about this story to me was this: she got the job because she disparaged another professor's knowledge of a specific Earth language. Noam Chomsky has done more to advance the study of linguistics than anybody in the last 30 years but his theories apply to any and all languages, not just one. Linguistics is not about any one language. It is about communication using language."

Okay, Don't bother burning fuel to go see this...<br/><br/>As an extremely appreciative movie goer, I for the life of humanity can NOT figure out who in their completely disillusioned mind thinks, believes or states this is a great movie. It fails to convict a final thought. It haphazardly does NOT entertain you like a 'Kubrick' film as another poster put it...LOL. The movie attempts to take you along a journey albeit never really getting started with quips into the future that relay in the story. This story 'telling' style must take the viewer with them.For that to happen, you have to have transitions that at some point can take you with it. It does, but literally at the END... The ideology of this film is so slow, you can definitely take a bathroom break and not miss a thing. <br/><br/>Hoping for either an epic new chapter, or a step to heightened script, it falls and fails to shift into second gear. This is so numbingly frustrated because the viewer is perceiving the shift into a OMG moment is almost there, and then it ends. Wait, what? So open ended, you ponder; what opiate was used in the storyboard design of this movie? Surely the book is a fantastical rendition where this is a flop. It might actually upset some viewers into shock when the end comes - because NO ONE knew what the end 'was' supposed to be... This film misleads, mis-entertains and loses to a zero end point of satisfaction. I get it was attempting to be a mind boggling super-deep-thinking film; but it's not. For all that is shown, the only true montage is that at some point we stupid 'humans' shut down and want to 'kill' the invaders. Can you read that at some point this 'is' going to happen... of course. <br/><br/>Then it ends. <br/><br/>Yep. <br/><br/>So flat and fruitless I was dually surprised and the language and upset 'WTF!s' being spouted out that I realized, I was not the only party with the same surprised disappointment...

","Arrival is a beautifully complex film that centers on the role of humanity in this world rather than the ""arrivals"". With this, the movie brings a new look to the sci-fi genre, as it deals with themes and emotions that many can relate to in the modern world. Arrival proves to be one-of-a-kind and one of the best in the genre, not just for pure action or the clichés we tend to see in such movies, but for its creativity and thought-provoking ideas it presents to the viewer. It is a movie that does require utmost attention, however, the experience is truly rewarding, as director, Denis Villeneuve continues his run of exceptional movies. Amy Adams, who plays a linguistic professor, leads the movie with a strong performance, yet playing a vulnerable character who succumbs to the events that unfold. The 'arrivals' themselves are wonderfully designed and their language particularly is a topic in on itself. Crafted with great cinematography and moving music, this was a deserved Oscar-nominated film, and truly one for the ages."

First off I am truly torn on whether this movie is even sci-fi in the first place. And I'll touch on that in a second. However, every sci-fi element in the movie is very, very poorly arranged and executed, and provide illogical, inadequate, or plain stupid answers.<br/><br/>Now, the movie has sci-fi elements for sure, it's a given that the movie _HAS ALIENS_, be that as it may - in the form of squids. But this movie is very similar to Interstellar, in the sense that it uses this sci-fi theme as a backdrop for some ""larger-than-life"", humanistic, pseudo-inspiring idea. The movie tries very hard to depict a multitude of different ""awe-inspiring"" ideas, such as globalism and humanism, coupled with a plot that has more holes than swiss cheese. The end result is that the movie fails in everything it tries to do, in varying degrees.<br/><br/>Now I said the movie is probably worth two stars, the additional star I'd be willing to give for the audio, which was apart from the protagonist's annoying panting (almost as bad as 2001), the only thing going for this movie."

"midge56","5","6","10","22 February 2017"," Overrated. Theme similar to Contact.
","This movie was more about the central human character & her life as it was for the key character in the film Contact. The first 5 minutes were terrible & boring & made no sense to the audience until the end. The movie should have started with the nearly empty classroom scene & placed the first 5 minutes farther into the film. The beginning of any film or novel should grip the attention of the audience or reader. This Director clearly failed to attend basic Directing 101 class.<br/><br/>However, the key characters interaction with the aliens & overcoming the language barrier was quite unique & would appeal to a non scifi audience.<br/><br/>The space crafts were so bizarrely oriented & crude interiors that they bordered on absurd. The premise that the aliens were here just for the topic of the future life of the key human character & her premonition skills was ridiculous. As was the insane notion that they would send 12 ships to earth just to chat about the future life & premonition skills of the female language expert or just to relay the message they would be back in 3000 years.<br/><br/>This is the third scifi film which has wasted a unique alien plot & effects by focusing on the life of the key human. This one inserts scenes from her future life without any prelude depiction of what was going on. They were irritating interruptions. Almost nothing was revealed about the aliens even after she broke the language barrier. She did not even accomplish the minimum of her intended job duties with the aliens. You would also think they would have studied one of our languages before visiting us. The military's lack of site control & security measures was truly unrealistic from reality.<br/><br/>Nor did anyone seem to comprehend the aliens had saved her life when a group of soldiers went off the range to kill the aliens. Nor did she thank them. One alien was dying as a result.<br/><br/>The music, sounds & background vocalizations are absolutely horrible. It sounds like someone killing a cow. This is the worst I have ever heard on any film ever. It is quite distracting & quite awful. I can't imagine what they were thinking.<br/><br/>The heavy breathing & her overacting when they first entered the craft was really annoying. Her constant near fainting was also way overdone as were her habitual hesitations to every question & task. All I could think at those scenes was coward & the military should have replaced her. Especially with her obsession with one word such as human, instead of moving on to something else. The choice of words was also quite bizarre. It didn't demonstrate her supposed language skills. She also should have had pictures such as the earth & galaxy & other pertinent subjects to identify. Their progress was also way too slow.<br/><br/>Too many missed opportunities wasted on the key character's personal life which was the central plot in conjunction with her language skills. The language barrier story was unique & interesting to watch although her choice of words to teach the aliens were less than preferable. But her personal life should have been jettisoned from the film entirely & replaced with details about the aliens, their home & intentions.<br/><br/>IRL; We need to get off these narcissistic ideas that we are great & the center of importance in the universe or the idea that aliens have any interest in helping us. Their only interest is in collecting our water resources, plant & animal life, ores & minerals and using us for laborers or experiments. They are not here to save us so we need to stop deluding ourselves with false impressions of our own importance. We cant even get along with other countries or have a common language with our neighbors. We are in for a rude awakening when we discover just how unimportant & chaotic our planet's divided population truly is in the universe.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of the art critics who rave accolades over a pile of garbage like made by Homer Simpson and destroy excellent movies like Oblivion. Non science fiction fans or critics or awards should not be judging scifi films. Nor should studios get involved with film titles & details like they did with Robinson Crusoe on Mars. An excellent realistic film forced to carry a bad title & no marketing promotion.<br/><br/>The language barrier theme is good enough to hold your attention so the movie is watchable without violence or battles but lacks any technology or special effects, even on the space crafts. Basically an egg shaped rock with a square tunnel drilled lengthwise & nothing else inside or outside which sits ungainly on the end. The aliens are each a giant Octopus missing one leg. Non scifi fans will like it better than true scifi fans. Anyone who needs battles, violence, special effects, technology & terror to gratify themselves need not bother to watch this film. There is none. It is a lot like the film Contact which focused on the human characters life."

But as things progressed, especially after the appearance of the aliens, I realized this was not to be the case. Eventually, the film devolved into a series of confused and confusing scenes that despite their stylish look seemed to add up to very little, until the whole thing eventually collapsed into a vast pool of anticlimax.

"johnhughes-97290","9","17","37","14 November 2016"," Wonder-full. Not so much a review, as a viewer's guide to some of the issues raised.
","Arrival is one of the finest movies of the year, firmly rooted in real people, real lives, and real science. The movie tells the story of first contact with an alien civilisation after spaceships land at twelve points across the globe.<br/><br/>The movie is based on 'A story of your life' a short novella by Ted Chaing. The story won the 2000 Nebula Award for Best Novella and the 1999 Sturgeon award.<br/><br/>Arrival expands on the novella in significant ways, including some stunning visualisations of semograms (alien language artifacts that are the central mystery of the plot), and visceral scenes aboard an alien space craft.<br/><br/>Definitions vary (hah!), but for me this is a rare, true science fiction film, dealing in reality and wonder rather than commercial mythologies or transplanted epic. The science is real, and is not broken for purposes of plot or visual kinetics.<br/><br/>Action scenes are few, and those expecting Star Trek may be disappointed or even bored. That said, its a beautiful, beautiful trip.<br/><br/>The movie knows its lineage: there are knowing visual nods to both 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Contact. More, probably – I'll tell you after my second viewing.<br/><br/>The Science of Arrival <br/><br/>Central to the plot of Arrival are a number of perennial issues in linguistics, anthropology, and physics. Without giving away specific spoilers, a simplified short listing may deepen your appreciation of the film, and allow you to dazzle your friends in the post-film caffeine debrief. After dipping back into the novella, here goes <br/><br/>No spoilers, but mention of central movie themes <br/><br/>The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis <br/><br/>The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is about how humans come to understand the external world. It states that language determines how we perceive reality, that we construct reality through the language we learn. <br/><br/>Linguistics has two competing ideas about about what language is. One is that it's a cultural artifact, the outcome of an evolutionary process, ordered but arbitrary. The other is that it's a cognitive mental response – a rule-based outcome of the human brain's encounter with external reality, bound by the structures of the brain itself. The first is particular, the other universal. There are lots of flavours, and lots of variant positions. (Was that Noam Chomsky the medivac team were carrying out on a stretcher?) <br/><br/>Do we think in words? Can we think without words, without metaphors to structure and taxonomies to enclose? Is human language intrinsically linked to the peculiarities of the evolved human mind, or is something more general?<br/><br/>Just how distorted or arbitrary *is* our mind's version of reality? Are there thoughts that can't be thunk, sentences that can't be sentenced? There is no way we can know.<br/><br/>Culture and the Limits of Communication <br/><br/>In anthropology, Sapir-Whorf broadens out to examine the multiple expressions of human (and alien?) meaning – cultures – and their various (in)compatibilities. It questions the limits of communication and understanding between cultures. (After the events of the US Presidential election, I'd venture to say even within cultures). Everything is context, everything has a deeper meaning, a history, and a trajectory of change. Translation is always partial.<br/><br/>What are the rules separating the word for a 'gift' from 'trade'? Or 'tool' from 'sacred object' or 'symbol of contract', or 'weapon'? Every object is held within a web of created meaning, shared meaning, dynamic meaning.<br/><br/>And yes, as the movie notes in passing, one of the Sanskrit words for war, 'gavisti', does indeed mean 'a desire for more cows'.<br/><br/>The Nature of Time <br/><br/>There are (at least!) two distinct views within science and philosophy on the nature of time. In Newtonian physics, time is sequential. A > B > C >D. Humans experience the world in temporal order, and perceive cause and effect.<br/><br/>However, General and Special Relativity model time as a fourth dimension of a single interwoven continuum called spacetime.<br/><br/>Fundamental laws of physics are time-symmetric: there is no fundamental difference between past and future. Time has no inherent direction: the equations work both ways.<br/><br/>Eternalism is the view that everything in time exists at once, and can be experienced simultaneously.<br/><br/>Physics <br/><br/>Mathematics is a mental tool: Physical laws can be described in a multitude of different ways, some more intuitive than others.<br/><br/>The most common formulations of physics are causal, Newtonian. Others can be purposeful, even teleological, looking to outcomes.<br/><br/>For example, light bends in water, and the path traveled is always the one that takes least time. Fermat's Principle describes the path of light through water by calculating minimal and maximal paths. We can say that the difference in the index of refraction causes light to bend when it hits water. Or, using Fermat, we can say that the light *decides* to minimise the time to travel to its destination, and has knowledge of effect before cause can be initiated. Two systems. One outcome.<br/><br/>Free Will and Paradox <br/><br/>If free will exists, we cannot know the future. Can we? Volition is an intrinsic part of consciousness. Isn't it?<br/><br/>Language of course, is not only a vehicle of communication and thinking. It's also a mode of action. It is performative, ritual.<br/><br/>Why would you go to see a play if you already know the script? Why would you listen to a song if you know every note? <br/><br/>Heh, I love this movie. See it. Have fun!"

Depending on what you like, you will most likely give this movie 4-8 stars, and that is what it deserves. How this film was nominated for an Academy Award is beyond me. (Great to see an SF movie nominated, just wish it had been The Lobster instead.)<br/><br/>This movie is speculative fiction, but the lack of science in this film is devastatingly apparent. There are a couple of other points that seemed very weakly written, but the movie on whole was well crafted. Acting, production values, score, etc. were all solid. The concept of the movie was great, but the plot and script needed work. I personally found the film engaging and was not bored. There is enough here to think about, but so much more could have been done with this film. Personally, I rate it a 6.5/10.<br/><br/>== SPOILER ALERT == So, the big problems as I saw them were in the plot. Once communication was achieved, data is collected and understanding of the language advances without any real reveal on how this was accomplished. We are just supposed to swallow that and move on. OK, maybe, but... it's just too much. As someone interested in linguistics, I want to know more about the possible processes used to communicate with an organism that does not share our cultural objects, our environment, an alphabet, etc. It struck me as odd that a classical linguist would be given this job instead of some scientist who studied other species and non-human communication. Wouldn't a Jane Goodall have had far greater insight into the language of an alien race? <br/><br/>The second big gripe I had was one single line at the end of the film. The linguist hugs her colleague and they realise they want to be together. OK, boring, but fine. Then she says this one line, basically if you knew what would happen in your life ahead of time, would you change anything? Why would she ask this question? It seemed to me that if she had truly 'learned' this alien language and all the philosophy it included, she never would have asked this question. She would have accepted it all, and not asked something so 'Philosophy 101'. She would have known there was no changing anything and that things are only as they are. I'm not a philosopher or a linguist, but I never really bought that she was either.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I thought the 'memory/vision' flashes were cleverly done. We viewed them as dreams or memories when they in fact a glimpse of the future. I felt like they pulled this off quite well, and that twist of the plot was clever. For me, this is where the movie scored extra points, along with the visual communication aspect of the aliens. Just different enough to give the brain some food for thought.<br/><br/>====End Spoilers=======<br/><br/>The fact that this movie was nominated for an award is an insult to SF. I have seen several far, far better pictures in the last few years. I cannot believe that this really viewed as the best one by the Academy. Unfortunately this just shows the politics and sway that factor into the nominations. By all means, watch this film. It was enjoyable and good entertainment. If you want to watch good SF though, give The Lobster a try."

Then the whole thing with Amy Adams just figuring out these circles in just a few weeks time and by the end she is basically communicating without assistance like yeah right.

OK, yes there is a great philosophical idea integrated into this movie approaching questions like: Does causality only acts forward in time? What is causality at all?

To which extent is our brain, and even reality, structured through the syntactic and semantic symbol systems we move in? Yes actually I find the topic great, if I think about it. You could write essays about it, do research etc. <br/><br/>But oh yeah, there is the rest of the movie. No matter the soundtrack or whatever. It is boring. Nothing really happens. No thrill. Nada.

I am totally flabbergasted that a world of giant squids who squirt ink but have the vast and incredible technology to travel between worlds and/ or galaxies (or dimensions) do not have the basic understanding to COMMUNICATE with their intended destination.<br/><br/>You can imagine the conversation: ""Shit! Something BAD is gonna happen and it involves those creatures on that little blue speck in that galaxy far far away (or parallel dimension or past time) and it's gonna affect US! Let's go and WARN them!""<br/><br/>""OK How are we going to TELL them?""<br/><br/>""Don't worry, They'll get the hang of it in no time""<br/><br/>Of course, there always happens to be a brilliant SINGLE person who can decipher the squid writing.

","It seems sci-fi has now come to its own end, meaning it can't come up with intelligent stories anymore. So it relies on pretentious, pseudo-intellectual scripts loosely based on a mix of misunderstood sciences (in this case, linguistics) and poor metaphysics. This movie left me with the same impression as Interstellar, that is to say stupid, pretentious, failing in every aspect, and ultimately ridiculous. I won't bother to analyse all the script's nonsense, as it has been stated by other reviewers, but more importantly, nonsense is not even the question here. Nonsensical scripts or plot holes can make a good movie if it doesn't try to aim higher than what it is, and if it's well executed, both being not the case here.
Apparently, seeing the high ratings for these movies, people seem to appreciate this kind of garbage... Well, good for them, but I proudly stand in the minority who certainly don't."

"athawolsux","6","4","6","2 February 2020"," Sadly overrated, with a story that's full of holes *major spoilers*
","I became a fan of Denis Villeneuve after watching Enemy and especially Prisoners, and I liked Sicario. But with Arrival I am having serious second thoughts. Arrival is a movie that appears very profound and meaningful at first glance but completely falls flat if you stop and really think about it. It is a very stylish movie that does not depend on effects or spectacle to create emotional impact, I'll give it that. It also explores an interesting premise, that of a peaceful ""arrival"" by aliens that are so utterly unlike us. It also has that tense and unnerving atmosphere that Villeneuve does really well, even complete with a little scene reminiscent of Enemy's giant spider scene.<br/><br/>Despite all that positivity, Arrival has to deserve this low score because its story's is riddled with huge flaws. It's full of holes, wholly implausible, and the movie has a clear problem with failure to communicate events, cause and effect and motivations.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie has a ""scale"" and ""detachment"" problem that makes everything difficult to believe. We are told to believe that the events unfolding at the Montana alien site are the most important thing that has ever happened in human history, but there is not much to show for it. The whole military operation is maintained by a few hundred soldiers, commanded by a colonel, and there is one linguistic expert on site (Louise). The whole thing seems to exist in a vacuum. There is no correspondence with the president or any other sort of higher-ups that we can see. We see everything else that goes on in the world through TV and computer screens. There are eleven other similar alien arrival sites across the world, and the other countries are apparently attempting to communicate with them much like our own heroes, but we don't learn much of anything about this process, until contact gets cut off. We learn that order starts to break down in different countries, but as seen on TV this has little impact and little explanation as to why it's happening.<br/><br/>The deciphering of the alien language makes up the crux of the story., and this process has a ""hard science"" feel to it. Except the movie completely fails to show exactly how this happens. There are literally NO concrete details as to how the initial (and most important) breakthrough is made. The scientists have a difficult and frustrating first few sessions, and then we are simply told in a montage that Louise has managed to teach the aliens the word for ""human"" and has started to make progress. This is a huge failure of the ""show don't tell"" principle, because we are in no way shown how this has happened. HOW did it happen? Later we are told that apparently at least two other countries - China and Russia - have managed to communicated with their aliens, China apparently with the help of a board game, but there are no real details on any of this.<br/><br/>Later on, the aliens present what is apparently their whole language, and this is their ""gift"" to humanity, because - as beings that can perceive all of time at once - they have deduced that 3000 years later they will need humanity's help. Putting aside the implausability of entities that can perceive the past and the future at the same time existing as anything other than godlike beings, there are several problems with this. What exactly is their gift? Louise, after being taken aboard the spaceship, gains the ability to see into the future and this is how she deciphers the entirety of the language. She says that mastering the language enables one to gain the ability to see all time as one, but if this is true, many people would gain this ability after the publication of Louise's book in the future, but there is no indication of this having happened. How does this gift work? And why does anyone think it CAN work? Louise herself gained the ability not through deciphering the language but apparently through ""magical"" means while contacting the aliens, because her ""flashforwards"" start much earlier, but there is no explanation as to why this happens only to her and not the rest of the science team.<br/><br/>In the movie's climax, as the various human militaries prepare to engage the aliens, the belligerent Chinese General Shang tells Louise in a flashforward scene how she convinced him to stand down by calling his private number and speaking to him his wife's dying words. Louise doesn't remember any of this, for some reason, so he shows her the number and tells her the words again. All of this is very much ""deus ex machina"" and makes zero sense when you stop to think about it. Louise not remembering the event seems to imply that is actually being ""created"" at that moment in the future in order to influence the past, and if so, it begs the question as to how the armies decided not to engage the aliens in the first place. It's classic time travel paradox. This is not even taking into consideration the implausability of all the nations suddenly deciding to come together just because some American scientist told a top Chinese general his wife's dying words in a phone call and then hung up.<br/><br/>In order to illustrate Arrival's failings to communicate its plot points clearly I am going to highlight a particular scene: The bombing carried out by the ""rogue"" soldiers. It makes no sense. A few soldiers, apparently brainwashed by some conspiracy theory radio show host, decide to ""do something"" about the aliens. Their plan is to plant a meager amount of explosives on the spaceship, an amount that cannot in any way destroy the ship. What are their motivitations? What is this going to accomplish? How come a group of apparently hand-picked and elite troops manage to get duped into doing this by listening to a random radio program? We don't know.<br/><br/>They plant the bombs, by coincidence at the same time as Louise and co decide to back up into the ship for another communication session, fail to stop the scientists, but then the aliens save them at the last minute, althougn one of them - ""Abbott""- is fatally injured. Exactly why beings that can see into the future fail to stop this happening before the last minute is unclear - except maybe for dramatic effect. This is especially more confusing for the alien who dies. Did he foresee his own death in the bombing, but simply chose to go along with it? Why? And to top it off, after this incident nobody in the military camp is making a big deal out of this, barely mentioning it when Louise asks about it. Except it's the biggest thing that has happened until that point and could end up literally destroying the world.<br/><br/>(Sigh)<br/><br/>And finally, I do like the tense atmosphere, but I don't like it when the only single emotion that the main character conveys for 95% of the movie is: ""tense"""

Please consult E.O. Wilson for all future alien films, because no advanced species capable of space travel would look like that. They wouldn't travel in a giant cloudy rock, they would have some semblance of opposable thumbs, and would have the ability to use their appendages to manipulate tools. These are just the facts of biological development and technological enhancement; not just on our planet, but on any planet capable of sustaining life (which would in any case be very similar to Earth.)<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was alright, if tediously paced and over-moralized. Look, I like the concept of some time-bending language, but humanity's problem is not that we have languages that force us to experience time linearly, but that we exist in a mostly rational, cause-and-effect universe that forces us to subsist in a linear timeline, and our languages correspondingly reflect that. <br/><br/>Keep the message, but work on your writing of our base, pitiful, linear English.

But this one made me so angry that now I'm typing and battling about whether I can be arsed to put down all of the things that made me shake my head whilst watching or whether I should just give up and hope that I have forgotten this piece of rubbish very soon. Nah, Sorry I need to get this out of my system, maybe this help me to get over this massive shock of disappointment.<br/><br/>Here are just a few of many head shakers:<br/><br/>-How convenient is it to have an old clearance so nobody has to work 2 minutes longer to give security clearance to anyone else...did Jeremy also have one lying around? <br/><br/>-Here comes Forest.

Please translate this, right now if you don't mind. <br/><br/>-It can never really get exciting because were over and over and over interrupted by Amy's back-flashes of her dying child which simply confuses and drags one down.<br/><br/>-The world seems to be run by the military, looks like no president or leader of a nation has a say. <br/><br/>-Forest and Jeremy are as useless a ejection seat on a helicopter. Forest does and say nothing helpful and the same goes for Jeremy, he's only there to be in total awe and to eventually fall in love with Amy.<br/><br/>-The aliens are a mix of squid and octopus with crab-like legs. I wonder how they build things. Let's ignore that in all of the universe the most likely (because it's the most efficient and practical in an evolutionary sense) form of body of an ""intelligent"" being is the humanoid form with two arms and two legs and a torso. <br/><br/>-Already the music (if you wanna call it that) or rather continuous loud hum is really getting on my nerves.<br/><br/>-The Alien's way of writing is the only thing that should have been interesting and in focus but the subject of deciphering a wholly new language is brushed aside buy being explained in a way nobody understands and all we get to see is that within a few weeks Amy has it all worked out. The audience wont understand it anyway so lets just have them believe that Amy is smarter then average Joe and they have no choice but to accept it.<br/><br/>-It becomes a political propaganda mess, yet again. The bad bad Chinese people misunderstand the words that are being exchanged, loose their patience and want to blow Squidward up. The bad bad Russian people wanna follow suit because they are bad and Americans are good. <br/><br/>-Oh look there's a bomb, nobody saw how it got into the ship apart from two soldiers that placed it there without being seen.<br/><br/>-The alien know about thew bomb and save Amy's and Jeremy's lives. Bless, now we all know they must be nice.<br/><br/>-I loose interest for Amy's drama, I just cannot care any longer.<br/><br/>-Apparently, what will seal humanity's fate lies in knowing what a mean Chinese person ""is going to"" whispers in Amy's ear which we will never hear.<br/><br/>The aliens depart and America saved the world from getting destroyed by another war. Amy wrote a book and now we are all prepared for when the aliens come back in 3000 years. But, is this child her second one or is history repeating and Jeremy is the father of the child she's going to loose....? Forward-back-flashes show her in hospital, the midwife passing her the baby seems to be the same shot from 5 hours ago when we thought it shows her as a younger mum...i just don't know anymore. Now is then and then is now and I just want it to stop.<br/><br/>I have not paid to watch this garbage and I'm very glad I didn't. I'm just so angry about how much I was looking forward to this and the ultimate realisation that I lost 2 hours I'm not getting back and the propaganda I was exposed to. I'm also annoyed about how obviously corrupt or easily manipulated the rating is. One must conclude that everybody involved in making this rubbish knew they have to fool people into spending money for the cinema to at least milk it while the deception lasts. I wished for a film that shows a sensible and realistic concept about how the human species would face the challenge of contacting an extraterrestrial intelligent life form. Language or other ways of communication would be a major barrier to overcome. But it would probably be the other way around, the aliens are likely quicker to figure out how to communicate with us filthy and stupid humans. Although they made their way through thousands or more lightyears and carrying a message, the aliens were made up a to be creatures that look just like animals to us and therefore the humans must find a way to communicate because the humans have got to be the most intelligent creation there is. *Sarcasm off*<br/><br/>I could go on for hours but it's not going to achieve anything so if you want to upset yourself watch it but do not spend money on it.

This movie is beautiful, despite it's dark aura and it's agonizing soundtrack.

Denis Villeneuve knows how to make good movies, he knows how to tell a story and this time he surpassed himself. All actors are perfect, starting with Amy Adams who deserves an Oscar for her touching, deep and moving performance. She has nothing to envy anyone, she is simply perfect. Going from each of her looks to each of her breaths when she has to face her fear of the unknown by entering the entrails of an extraterrestrial vessel, she is remarkably excellent.

So she is good and so her silences are loaded with emotions, her breaks are never annoying and her ¨flashback¨ are always relevant.<br/><br/>I did not expect to be transported into such an exciting drama. We are immersed in it from the first minutes and until the end we wonder how this relates to the story of these creatures that reach the four corners of the globe. But the two are intertwined and form an whole immensely coherent.<br/><br/>I loved the language lessons throughout the film. Because language is the node of the latter. It is all a question of communication, of being able to understand oneself and especially of understanding ¨them¨. Then there is time space that plays its role wonderfully.

Aliens come to earth and start showing up at random places around the globe and a university professor has less than 10 students in an over 100 classroom seating area and she wonders where everyone is and carries on with her lessons?, she happens to know Sanskrit, a mostly lost language, and speaks with aliens that apparently just happen to know the language by means of symbols, the aliens are friendly somehow and communicate through, what appears to be a glass wall, a U.S. Colonel from the U.S. military who was from some African nation who can barely speak English is in charge of delivering people to these so-called friendly aliens has them dress up in a non-military chem suit and have not even tested to see if the spacecraft is filled with radiation before delivering civilians to this stupid looking spacecraft that looks more like something from the movie Cocoon, negotiating with aliens that you do not even know are friendly or not is a ridiculous concept and a leftist ideology, etc..etc...etc....

This is what a first encounter could really look like, attempting to communicate with beings so far advanced that simply understanding a single word would be a challenging task. Contact felt like it was made by a committee that needed to get all of Earth's issues discussed, at least amongst the humans. Religion, politics, nationalism, etc. because somehow the aliens are supposed to care. I like this film's approach because it shows that while the aliens recognize that this is a divided planet, our borders and petty human issues really don't matter in the scheme of the Universe. Beautifully acted, well-written and poignant on many levels. This is a thinking person's film which I believe Arthur C. Clarke would consider well done. Imagine a future in which . . . .

","Folks we all know that many of the reviews submitted to IMDb are from the people who either made the movie or knew someone in the cast or crew. That's the only way I can explain that high overall review rating for this terribly boring and poorly made attempt at SF. First let's start with the so-called aliens. All the writer/director did with this thing was to use octopuses (or would that be octopi) as the model for alien creatures (wow how 50ish) and they even used the fact that the earth bound octopus species uses black ink, which it squirts in a defensive mode) to somehow communicate with humans. Overall, it was just another left wing Hollywood picture that puts humans in a ""bad light"" because we supposedly can't get along and therefore allow our murderous intentions toward the alien visitors to run rampant. It was poorly done and in the theater I attended, right around 1/4 of the people left before it was over.

There were some underlying sub-plots, but nothing of great significance. I also had trouble understanding what the actors we saying much of the time, although no doubt this was in part due to their American accents which I often have trouble with.

"jdkraus","10","12","27","30 November 2016"," Visually awe-inspiring with a profound story
","While most modern-day sci-fi flicks focus on extravagant CG set pieces and mindless destruction, Denis Villeneuve's film ""Arrival"" offers the viewer something much more profound and thought-provoking. As twelve canoe-shaped spaceships touch down on earth, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and scientist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are recruited by the US government to investigate the purpose of the newly arrived extraterrestrials. <br/><br/>The plot focuses on how Banks and Donnelly attempt to communicate with the aliens and understand their mission. Rather than this process being tedious or even boring, screenwriter Eric Heisserer constructs an interesting and well-crafted story, built on mystery, tension and intrigue. As a viewer, I wanted to know about the aliens identity, their mission, and whether humanity will go to war or if a compromise could be made. The tension is astronomically well done. I kept guessing till the end and was pleasantly surprised with the final outcome. The creativity of the alien language and the use of linguistics help make the film even more plausible. Without giving too much away, it is amazing how a simple set of words could easily be misinterpreted or construed. That's one of the several underlying themes of this movie, how people make quick judgments without fully comprehending the meaning of another individual's, or in this case, an aliens' perspective. Language can be a powerful weapon.<br/><br/>The visuals and aesthetics of ""Arrival"" are simply astounding. The sheer scale of the alien spacecrafts is terrifying and unique. Even though the aliens resemble large cephalopods, they pose as a powerful and foreboding force. Bradford Young's cinematography consists of dimly lit interior rooms, sometimes only lit with computer screens, and overexposed exterior shots. His choice of lighting and camera angles makes the movie feel real, almost like a documentary versus a studio lit scene from a soundstage. But the component I enjoyed the most was the sound design. Some scenes are deathly quiet and then bang, something loud happens. This technique made me feel like I was part of the movie. Johann Johannson's score takes the film's sound to a new level. He conveys something intense, magical, and above out of this world (I hope he wins an Oscar). Max Richter's piece ""On the Nature of Daylight"" adds an additional layer of emotion to this great film.<br/><br/>The final highlights of what makes ""Arrival"" an excellent alien contact movie are the performances. Renner is solid as Donnelly, determined to a find scientific way to communicate with the aliens. It is nice to see him take more dramatic roles rather than playing Hawkeye from ""Marvel's: The Avenger's."" Amy Adams as Dr. Banks could easily receive her sixth Oscar nomination. Her performance is based on subtlety, particularly with her movements and facial expressions. She can express so much emotion without uttering a single word. Instances like these are what can make an actor either really good or bad. Adams is simply wonderful. <br/><br/>2016 still has quite a few movies left to hit the theaters. So far, ""Arrival"" is the best one I have seen."

"LloydBayer","9","10","22","25 November 2016"," One of the best Sci-fi films in mainstream cinema
","As an alien first contact film, Arrival isn't just an ambitious answer to an age old question ""are we alone?"" its high concept thinking in presenting an answer to that question is a rarity in mainstream cinema these days. And unlike the typical bamboozle of a sci-fi blockbuster, this film isn't a thrill ride meant for 4DX cinema either. Rather, a crushing yet astute mediation on some of the biggest and perhaps oldest problems with the human race – our perception of what makes us human, our success and failure at communication and our discomposure associated with the unknown. <br/><br/>Known for his baroque styled narration, director Denis Villeneuve is in no hurry to reveal the mystery behind seemingly random alien landings in twelve countries. The visualization of these megalith spaceships is a cinematic achievement in itself, aided with a haunting sound design engineered to raise goose bumps, but more on this later. Meanwhile, and ever the trigger-happy race, governments of these countries have already mobilised a pre-emptive strike. As expected, the United States military is also gung-ho but not before sending linguistic expert Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) into the ship to find out what they want. Working with the military (represented by Forrest Whitaker) and a theoretical physicist played by Jeremy Renner, Louise first learns their language and then discovers that it's not about what they want but why they are have come. <br/><br/>With preceding films like Interstellar and Contact, the story here isn't really new, or even about the existence of intelligent life outside our planet. By the time Louise arrives at the astounding revelation, it dawns on the viewer that Arrival has more to do with the mysteries of our own existence, our innate ability to experience joy and sorrow, and even the incredible ability to change our own fate. Adams owns this film as much as the lines on the back of her hand. Hers is a tragic character played with conviction throughout the film, and then towards the end, hits it out of the park with a climactic moment that defines the human value of compromise. <br/><br/>Although conceptually incredible with real life takeaways, Arrival is not perfect. For a worldwide event, the narrative is almost entirely about Louise, her deciphering of the alien language and how that information relates to the future of mankind. Supporting roles from Renner is also saved for a few scenes and also for what appears to be a paradox in the story, while Whitaker's military man is just there to throw the audience into thinking this film could end up like another misguided Prometheus. There is also a bit of slack in the pace during the middle segment that builds on the aforementioned paradox. However, this is also where we learn more about her personal loss and the impact of grief in our existence.<br/><br/>Having said that, Arrival still has the craftsmanship of a great film that demands our full attention in return for a rewarding experience. Technical aspects are also critical to the overall production design with sound and visuals forming a skeletal binding with the story. Is it Villeneuve's magnum opus? That depends on what he does next. Until then, this is probably the best science fiction film of the decade and one of the best films of the year."

","This is one of the few movies that made me scratch my head afterwards, trying to figure out if what I've just seen was to my liking or not. I still have no idea. In a way Arrival reminded me of Interstellar - a smart sci-fi flick with strong family drama woven in, and I liked that part of it. I also enjoyed that it commented more on the human race than focusing solely on aliens. I thought the twist in the end put a lot of things in perspective, and offered the viewer a chance to consider fate and choices. I also enjoy dabbling with linguistics, so a movie where I can basically nerd out for two hours is always welcome.<br/><br/>What I didn't like is the weak reasoning behind alien presence. Honestly, the question that Amy Adams kept asking them, What is your purpose, never really got a satisfactory answer. There are many crucial points that are left unexplained to the viewer, ie the scene with the Chinese general. Some of the messages in the movie, especially the one about ""working together"" were too cheesy for my tastes. The romance, and that was a bit turn off for me, was unfounded and inorganically introduced. We were sort of expected to believe that it happened, but no actual build up was created by the writers or the director.<br/><br/>Overall, an average for me."

","The only way Arrival could have cost $47 million to make would be for the actors to get most of that sum. There just wasn't much to the film in both location filming and special effects.<br/><br/>It seems to me the production company may have been trying to do a number on the IRS come tax time. There were only five basic locations: Amy Adam's home in the film, the college where she teaches, the army base, the field where the alien spacecraft was and a very nondescript spaceship interior.<br/><br/>As for the film...in other times it would be a B sci-fi movie. But these days, the millennials are making into a mind bending sci-fi masterpiece, which it isn't.<br/><br/>We are supposed to buy that technically advanced giant squid-like creatures not only build huge spacecraft and travel all over the galaxy, but they can foretell the future as well. And apparently one of their visions told them to come to the Earth...more specifically 12 of them come to Earth, hovering peacefully over various nations.<br/><br/>Yet, with this on their minds, if they have any, and all their evolutionary and inter galactic knowledge they don't have a simple tourist English phrase book among them...they can't communicate with anyone. That is until Adams comes along. She's a linguist recruited by the army to translate a single grunt sound that came from the aliens. Good luck on that.<br/><br/>The aliens hold an open house for the earthlings hoping that someone will talk to them. Adams rises into the ship and meets the space aliens who appear behind a glass barrier (we assume their atmosphere is different from earth's). <br/><br/>The outer space cephalopods seem to be dancing around similar as marionettes would do...except no strings are visible. It's really out of the campy 1950s movie scene.<br/><br/>Nothing much is explained in the film which leaves the audience to figure out how Adams finally communicates with the visitors. At the end you are left with questions and no definite answers."

"jkbonner1","5","7","14","30 December 2016"," Disappointing
","I really enjoy good sci-fi movies and look forward to them when they come out. I saw good reviews of Arrival and was anxious to see it when it came to the movie theaters. Although Arrival has some very good actors in it, Amy Adams (American Hustle), Jeremy Renner (The Immigrant), Forest Whittaker (The Last King of Scotland), the script is implausible and the action drags along at a snails pace. <br/><br/>I say the script is implausible for two reasons: (1) Linguists have had knowledge of the existence of Cretan Linear A for over a century, but no linguist to date had had any success in translating it (unlike Cretan Linear B). This demonstrates how difficult it is to decode a strange script, even if one form of it (Cretan Linear B) has been successfully tackled. That is why the deciphering of the squids' writing system in Arrival seems totally implausible. (2) Also, if the squids have the technology to create spaceships that can traverse quadrillions of miles of space and defy gravity when they land, they could certainly have created a device to translate their language into Earth languages and vice versa. <br/><br/>As I assume that Arrival isn't meant to be fantasy, both of these issues are serious plausibility gaps in the movie. The depiction of the squids languidly swishing back and forth in a large sealed vat of smoky liquid (or gas--I couldn't tell) looked amateurish. In addition, as I mentioned above, the movie moves along incredibly slowly. Except for the Amy Adams character, the rest were one-dimensional. <br/><br/>Conclusion: I get it. The squids bring all humans together as one. They're good guys and they want us all to get along and play nice together. And in 3000 years they'll call on us for help. Have a visit by aliens (good ones of course) and we'll all have peace on Earth. What a peachy ending. Boy, if only it were that simple. <br/><br/>Overrated. Mediocre at best. Too bad because it has some good actors in it. A better script and better special effects would have helped. <br/><br/>5 out of 10. Good try though."

For something as empty as the story of this movie, acting is actually quite good, and that is the only good angle of it. <br/><br/>Even the visual effects are decent. The only problem is that there is no story-line to keep you interested. Entire movie you're waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never does.

"cestades","6","7","14","14 November 2016"," A bit of a disappointment
","Being a sci-fi fan, and having read some really interesting stories that speculate about the eventual problems involved in communicating with aliens, I expected to really enjoy this movie. Unfortunately, I ended up very disappointed for two things that really bothered me.<br/><br/>First, it is the use of the time paradox in a way that, to me, falls more in the realm of fantasy than proper science fiction. It is exactly the same formula they used in Interstellar, which, in my humble opinion, destroyed the educational potential of that movie. Is it that pure science fiction is too dull for the public that they have to add in some esoterism? Apparently, it is so. For me, a much more elegant and profound treatment of the idea of non linearity of time was presented by Robert Sawyer in his novel Flashforward.<br/><br/>Second, I think the story has a big flaw. Here we have this very advanced civilization that traveled from far away with a gift for humanity, which, apparently, will have to return the favor in 3,000 years into the future. So they have an elaborate - long term - plan. They (apparently) know our needs (unless they brought some useless alien souvenirs). They also know that we are not a unitary civilization so they split the gift into parts to make us collaborate (cliche). Given the latter, I would assume that they'd studied us a little and, likely, figured out some of the basics of human communication systems well before embarking in this journey. So why risk this entire operation by having the primitive humans make all the communication efforts? It seems that someone, either the aliens or the script writers, didn't give it a careful thought."

","I just caught this movie on Hulu. I must admit I don't recall this movie's theatrical release. But when I saw the high rating on IMDB and Rotten tomatoes I thought I would give it a try. <br/><br/>While I do agree with other users that the pace was slow for a movie about aliens, I learned the pace was intentional in order to deliver a poignant, original and thought-provoking film. Like others, I shook my head in disbelief when Amy Adams pulled out a white board, wrote her name and tapped on her chest to make first contact with the Aliens. I thought, ""oh no"" please don't tell me your doing the ""me Tarzan, you Jane"" thing. I also read reviews about plot holes. Now, I don't approach movies with the emotion of a wooden stump and methodically dissect their logic. If you do, then maybe heed the warnings of others in your camp. For me, that's where the faults of this movie ends, and the rewards of experiencing this film are far greater. <br/><br/>I like films that surprise me, that make me care about the characters and provide a journey. And that doesn't happen that often. Many movies today are so unoriginal. But ""Arrival"" aims to be different. Based on a short story ""Story of Your Life"" by American writer Ted Chiang, director Denis Villeneuve and the rest of the filmmaking team managed to present a poignant, original film unlike any other that I have seen in the science fiction genre. <br/><br/>In the end, this isn't a movie about an alien invasion. You'll be disappointed if you expect Will Smith to pop out of an aircraft and knockout an alien with his fist. It's a movie about the human experience and explores such themes as interpersonal communication, life, loss and unconditional love.<br/><br/>I had to give this movie it's high score because it deserved it. But also because it definitely does not deserve an extremely low score of 1, 2 or 3. Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and Green Lantern deserve low scores of 1, 2 or 3. This is a much watch for anyone who likes films that make you scratch your head and wonder in utter amazement."

","Here comes another 'non-spoon-feeding' film. Traditionally saying, 'non-spoon-feeding' is great for viewers. However, when the movie leaves no a single clue, it is turned to be terrible instead of an art. This movie reminds me of Steven Spielberg's the Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Extra-Terrestrial objects/lifeforms arrived at our planet surface and they/it are/is looking for some humans who can easily communicate with. The aliens used music instrument for communication (How cool is that!!!). In this Arrival (2016), The heptapods are not ... so ... talkative, but they like to write instead. Anyways, their ships are similar to the monolith in '2001: A Space Odyssey' ... ""It's full of stars.""<br/><br/>Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Hawkeye ... oh, ehh ... Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) came to have a chat with heptapods. After that, the film was interrupted with flashbacks. It is not bad if there were only a few flashbacks, but there were a ton of flashbacks. Swapping again and again. You have to imagine that how fun a movie is if their have too much intermissions. No doubt if viewers have a bad mood. <br/><br/>At last, they were not flashbacks at all, but Dé·jà vus instead. At this moment, a question is came, Dr. Banks saw a real future or it is just illusions that heptapods rendered in her brain, which is to persuade her.

I think in the situation shown in the film, the quality of all personnel on the project would be the best that we could offer. The idea that you'd have a bunch of grunts easily seduced by some webcast to effectively mutiny against their own felt way, way off base. Furthermore the lack of repercussion given to the action rather than a cursory 'some guys went mad' line was just odd.<br/><br/>Really, some soldiers decided to plant their own device and endanger our interactions with an alien species and it was just pied off with a line of dialogue, just felt lazy and treated the audience with utter contempt. It really felt like 'oh we need some drama and a ticking clock device. It doesn't make much sense but just put it in anyway'.<br/><br/>People simply dismissing it as 'people are crazy' is not a good excuse in my mind. That means a director could introduce a random character in any film to carry out a random action and then have it validated by people saying 'oh people are stupid, didn't you know'.<br/><br/>For all the praise that the film is getting, it really was just very average in my opinion."

","Denis Villeneuve, director of last year's looming, dark Sicario, has a dabble with science fiction, about some otherworldly visitors with unclear intentions. It's central to Amy Adams' Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist who is enlisted by the U.S. Military to attempt to communicate and understand the visitors reasons. <br/><br/>Recruited by stern, demanding Col. Weber (Forest Whitaker) and teamed up with scientific mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) they travel out to a remote beautiful part of Montana to start conversation with the extra-terrestrials. <br/><br/>Something that is always a challenge for this particular genre is the creativity, as there can be endless possibilities but also that danger of becoming so unbelievable it becomes ridiculous or possibly annoying. Fortunately it's a believable story and has a deeper meaning than just the usual alien encounters with an unknown purpose. Are they friend or foe and if they're no threat then what do they want? <br/><br/>What is an integral part of the plot is that the this isn't the only encounter and is actually one of twelve hovering above supposedly strategic locations around the globe, which still remain a mystery. As usual, Hollywood has to give the American point of view with the rest of world taking a back seat or worse, being disgruntled, fearful trouble-makers. In fact, there's possibly more of a threat from our own actions. <br/><br/>It's tackles how we, as a human race might deal with an unexplored situation like this and begs to question humanity as a whole, hoping that our stupidity does not get the better of us. There's so much more to the plot than what any trailer suggests and whilst almost agreeing with the hype of being ""the greatest sci-fi movies in years"" it isn't entirely original or unpredictable having elements of Signs and Contact. <br/><br/>Things get weird, and like with Interstellar, all isn't what it seems and while some of it is predictable, it's clever enough to not give everything away, even at the end, some questions remain unanswered, leaving viewers in wonder and discussion. <br/><br/>Darkness is no alien to Villeneuve's style and his use of light is brilliant, especially during the conversations and visions. But what is incredible is the sound, the language sounding like whale song or elephants. Again reminding me both of Signs and Contact where sound was a key element of the films. <br/><br/>The score is also amazing, Villeneuve's usual composer Jóhann Jóhannsson composes an immersive soundtrack especially the vocal/choral songs like ""Kangaru"" and the build up like ""Hydraulic Lift"" that raises the tension tenfold but there's a certain ambiance about it as well. <br/><br/>Superbly paced, it's suspenseful and engaging. While there are plenty of moments where viewers might get lost, it rushes to its conclusion before it gets complete confusing. Intriguing plot, strong performances and good creativity makes it's a definite must-see, even for non-sci- fi fans. <br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 9 Script: 8 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for a clever, not-what-you-think-it-is sci-fi thriller.

As mankind teeters on the verge of global war, Banks and the team race against time for answers - and to find them, she will take a chance that could threaten her life, and quite possibly humanity.<br/><br/>'Arrival' is projected as a Sci-Fi Alien Invasion film, and it is, but that's only on the surface. At heart & soul, 'Arrival' is a story on motherhood, the gift of being special & how violence is not always the answer to fight an endangering third kind. 'Arrival' is as much an emotional drama, as it sticks to being a Sci-Fi visual dazzler. I wouldn't want to give away the film's final twist, but all I can say is, we barely come across a twist as sharp & moving as this one. It simply WOW's you!<br/><br/>Eric Heisserer's Adapted Screenplay is masterful. Easily one of the finest Screenplays to get made into film, Eric's affecting & engrossing Writing make 'Arrival' something so special, its hard to forget it anytime soon. The narrative builds up suspense, tension & an undercurrent of emotions, without ever giving you the feel of over-stuffing. Oscar Chase seems very possible for Eric! <br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve's Direction is excellent. Emerging as one of THE finest directors of our time, Villeneuve creates such a mood & an atmosphere so accurate, you'd be silly if you looked away from the screen at any time. Bradford Young's Cinematography is stunning. Young creates poetry out of every frame & makes 'Arrival' an experience to be witnessed. Joe Walker's Editing is razor-sharp. Art & Costume Design are flawless. Graphics are top-notch. Jóhann Jóhannsson's Score is exhilarating. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks, delivers a sensational performance. In a career filled with knockout performances, Adams again delivers, this time, with even more skill & sheer conviction. The supremely talented actress carries the film on her firm shoulders & not for even a single second, does she let you go. If this performance doesn't get Oscar attention, then what does an Oscar even mean? Jeremy Renner underplays his part well. Forest Whitaker is effective, as always. Michael Stuhlbarg is solid. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Arrival' is Cinema At Its Very Best! The film goes beyond the clichés of the genre its based upon & delivers something unforgettable. Grab a ticket today!"
"sobeit712","2","8","17","20 January 2017"," Sad reminder of the lack of true classics in this generation
","What's good about this movie: The strongest point of this movie is the well-developed emotional arch for the female lead, which makes a rather nonsensical plot line somewhat relatable at least on the emotional level. Now on to the bad: The idea of friendly and benevolent alien face off with idiotic, paranoid and violent human is nothing new. Also, as some may have already mentioned, many of the plot details are laughable at best and rather insultingly nonsensical at worst. Crossing of barrier of space-time continuum, traveling billions light years to earth, an alien technology so advanced that they can defy the law of gravity and suspend aircrafts the size of a big island in midair, yet somehow, all the greatest minds and biggest decision makers on earth believe that such advanced being can be deterred by bullets, bombs and explosives. More unbelievably, even with the tightest security control, some idiotic crew members somehow managed to sneak in a c4 explosive and hopefully blow the aliens away with a single C4. Near the end, soldiers can just ride up in 4x4s like whole bunch of cow boys and spray bullets at the alien air crafts while the Colonel sit in the room like a dumb ass without any control over the situation. The whole movie is a smear campaign of China and Russia. It just feeds right into American's fear of the rising Chinese power. Somehow Chinese are scarier than the aliens, even though they are just fellow human beings. Communicating with Chinese or Russian somehow proved to be more difficult than communicating with aliens. What a load of bullock. Yeah, China is going to destroy earth, but alien saves the day. The fear and alienation of Chinese presented in this movie borderline racism. But don't worry, one single phone call to the Chinese General and some whisper of his wife's dying words will change everything and finally we accomplished the ever elusive world peace! Hurray! Except the two main leads: The scientist guy and the linguistics girl, every single human character in this movie come off like stupid arrogant ass and a disaster waiting to happen. Nobody seems to possess a single ounce of sense. And why bring a bird into the aircraft? If you want to test the air, shouldn't you let the bird in ""before"" human?"

","""Arrival"" is a mystery, sci-fi movie, directed by Denis Villeneuve, who also directed two other critically acclaimed movies I loved watching: ""Prisoners"" and ""Sicario"". This time, Villeneuve takes on the subject of extra-terrestrial life, and the communications between humans and aliens from another planet, starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whittaker in the lead cast. I'm not gonna lie, this movie floored me from beginning to end, and I came out from the cinema with satisfying feeling of watching what I think is one of the – if not the – best movie of this year. This movie is one big mystery from start to finish, forcing you to watch and to be amazed and intrigued of the outcome. This movie reminded me of a well-directed Christopher Nolan movie like ""the prestige"" or ""memento"", where the mystery is being beautifully resolved at the end. All it needed was some epic music composed by Hans Zimmer, but even that is unnecessary because the music composed for this movie was just as beautiful as well. Amy Adams plays the lead role as a top-skilled linguist, and is being contacted by the military to try interpret and establish communication between the aliens and us. Adams plays excellent in the movie, and now that we are closing in on the Oscar season, Adams could be in for a best leading actor nomination. I am also being told that she plays a good leading role in ""Nocturnal animals"" that is out now, so if she shouldn't be nominated for ""Arrival"", maybe she has a second chance with ""Nocturnal animals"". Jeremy Renner and Forest Whittaker play as supporting characters, who both do a good job. Renner plays as a theoretical physicist, and is not a crucial character for the movies story to work, but he adds humour and plays good along with Adams, so he wasn't a problem for me in the movie at all. Whittaker works great as a Colonel in the military, who is used to guide and tell the audience of the movie what is happening, and to move the plot of the movie forward. In the end, ""Arrival"" is a beautifully shot movie, that not only examines the communication between extra-terrestrial life and humans, but also the communication between humans themselves and how we seem more alienated with the people we live on earth with than the aliens above us."
"debearsolitaire","10","8","17","7 December 2016"," A philosophical contemplation
","Arrival opens with a gentle fusion of architecture, music and nature to set a somewhat melancholy mood. The story is developed from the perspective of a linguist (Amy Adams); given the size of its budget, time duration and its ambitious scope, this movie is a success. It gives the viewers an opportunity to contemplate their own lives in relation to other people and to the infinite. Who are we? Why are we here? How do we judge since no one has seen God? Is life worth living - given its tragedy or its beauty or both? Everyone has their own answers; this movie affirms the worthwhile aspects of life in spite of our differences and our general skepticism toward each other (e.g. among races and politics). The movie also hints at the union of language (symbol) and science (method)."

","I sort of have a degree in linguistics. My MA is in English with an emphasis in ""language, writing, and rhetoric."" I enjoyed Amy Adams' character in this film as a linguist. I have reservations about nearly all the rest of this popular film.<br/><br/>My wife and I just saw this last night on opening night at an antique theater in Santa Barbara. Please be warned:<br/><br/>The rest of my review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Fans of Interstellar may enjoy Arrival most. It has to do with time and getting outside it. I personally feel this has been beaten like a dead horse in movies. Here, Villanueva uses the theme in attempt to ""Ooh and Ahh"" audiences once again, in my armchair opinion.<br/><br/>It didn't move me.<br/><br/>Amy Adams plays a linguist and single mother who has a daughter who dies of cancer. Forest Whittaker commissions her to translate an alien message. It climaxes when she realizes that language determines how you see reality and therefore because she learns the alien language, she is outside of time. She then realizes she married a guy she works with and had her daughter but after sharing all this with her husband, he doesn't ""look at the daughter the same way,"" assuredly because he knows she will die.<br/><br/>The big idea is to choose to have the daughter with her short life even if you know she is going to die. Carpe diem.<br/><br/>In short, there are so many effects like the gravity of the space ""stones"" that are never explained. I wasn't impressed with the aliens nor with the whole ""a language makes me see through time"" concept.<br/><br/>It was just OK. I was moderately entertained. Mostly, in the daughter/mother scenes and flashbacks, I was glad I had popcorn and red vines for distraction. I recommend this film for people who have lost someone too soon and fans of Interstellar. Too bad, this could have been a science fiction film as advertised."
"erlendjh","10","9","20","12 February 2017"," This film made me rethink life, it made me more conscious about life decisions
","This is my first review here on IMDb, which I hope says a lot, when I made a profile just to write my opinion on this movie. I enjoy movies, I am not someone who is familiar with all the best directors and so on. My review will be based on my opinion, my actual experience watching this movie. <br/><br/>Are you a person who likes to think? Simple question, which is hard to know the answer to. If you are curious about whether there is a bigger meaning to life, curious about the very fundamental questions in life in general, or eager to learn if we are alone in this universe, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>I know this is only a movie. A well thought through, excellent filmed, perfectly directed, mind-bending, life changing film. This film will not only have you drop a few tears in the end (I have experienced this during max a couple of movies, like We Are Marshall, Interstellar and maybe The Shawshank Redemption), it will have you focus on the important things in life. What is the most important thing in life for most of us? What will we look back at when we are old and memories are all we have left? <br/><br/>Like we all (most of us) know, life can, and will be tough to us. We will face challenges that can be hard to deal with, we will experience tragedy, disease, death of a loved one, loneliness, depression and regrets. <br/><br/>We think of the future as a period of time where things will hopefully be perfect. We think of it as a period consisting of months, maybe even years where we are completely happy with everything in our lives. In the end though, this is not the truth of what is going to be our future. We life through life day by day, and every day we make choices which help form our next day. That happy, stress-less period of time we think of as our future, is not the future, it is our hope for a better everyday. <br/><br/>I do not mean to be harsh here, this is a wonderful thing. It means we stand to make thousands and thousands of choices which can help us achieve our goals, find someone we love, care for our family and do the right things. <br/><br/>We know that we will experience some of the things i mentioned above. But we still want to experience it. That's what life is, right? A circle, filled with occasions, good and bad, and choices, hard and easy ones. If we choose to live on for longer than our own human lives, then we can also do so, by letting our sons and daughters carry on our good knowledge, emotions and decisions. <br/><br/>This movie emphases all of this. Does it seem irrelevant to write all this? Maybe it is, who am I to say what you think. But this is what I had in my head after watching this movie. <br/><br/>Watch it, you will not regret it if you are a ""thinking"" person."
"aleksander-klajderic","10","9","20","30 November 2016"," Well thought out mix of ideas packaged in a sci-fi movie. Just what I was hoping for.
","I honestly don't understand the dissatisfaction of some reviewers. Maybe sci-fi is too broad of a topic and some of the people just wanted to see flashy explosions and alien shooting. Although I found many themes of the movie a bit overused (themes and ideas already seen in other movies, but don't want to go into detail here), it is still an original and grown up attempt to the genre.<br/><br/>It would require more risk taking to make this movie really stand out, but at the same time, that probably wasn't the main objective. It was thoughtful and entertaining just enough to keep the average sci-fi buff hooked for 2 hours. At the end of the day, I guess it comes down to personal taste and I can safely say I wasn't disappointed at all.<br/><br/>Villeneuve is becoming a director to look forward to."
"MaximumMadness","10","10","23","3 January 2017"," ""Arrival""- A masterpiece of the Science Fiction genre. One of the best films of 2016.
","Every so often, you encounter one of those rare films that reminds you of the sheer magic and emotion that films are capable of crafting and creating. And 2016's magnificent Science Fiction drama ""Arrival"" is most certainly one of those rare treats. An emotional tale directed by Denis Villeneuve, ""Arrival"" is an absolutely stunning exploration of the unknown- whether it be what lays beyond our stars, or what lurks deep inside of our own heart.<br/><br/>Linguist expert Louise Banks (Amy Adams) awakens one day to discover along with the rest of humanity that extraterrestrial crafts have begun to land all over the world, hovering ominously just off the ground, seemingly in waiting for something. Soon enough, she is whisked away to Montana with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), in the hopes that the two can help the military to start communication with the beings on-board. Through hard work and perseverance, eventually a dialog is established with the extraterrestrial ""heptapods."" However, Louise's own emotional conflict and the growing paranoia of the world at large- fueled by an increasing media circus- threatens to destroy all of the work done to create a peaceful communication between the two races.<br/><br/>The film is at its core a very character-centered drama set to the backdrop of a classic sci-fi alien story. However, the extraterrestrial beings here don't threaten to destroy the planet... their presence makes humanity threaten to destroy itself out of fear. It's quite clever and consistently enthralling. Much of the film's runtime is devoted simply to seeing the alien beings trying to communicate their points to our human leads with their wildly different way of ""speaking."" But it's constantly intriguing and will grab your attention instantly, never letting go. It's fascinating. Most science fiction films would rather spend their time blowing up landmarks while broad archetypal characters spout one-liners and pretentious techno- babble. ""Arrival"" instead spends its time blowing our minds over and over with its very real drama and shockingly realistic portrayal of ""first contact.""<br/><br/>The performances, and indeed the exceptional writing courtesy Eric Heisserer are what makes the film however. This is a movie all about character and emotion, and Amy Adams rises to the occasion with one of the greatest performances of her career. She injects such a pure, pained and sympathetic soul into Louise, and you'll be behind her completely throughout the entire film. She's one of the most compelling characters of the year, and I honestly hope Adams receives the recognition she deserves for her turn as their character. Renner is an exceptional supporting lead, and continues to stretch his acting chops, much as he has many times in the past few years. As much as I adore him in his more action-oriented roles, it's just so refreshing seeing him challenged in a more complex and realistic performance. I also highly admired Forest Whitaker as a senior military official who serves as our third and final lead, and he gives a good sense of both authority and sympathy in a role that could have otherwise come across as flat.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve solidifies his position as perhaps one of the most important and invaluable filmmakers working today with his excellent and expert guidance of the story. In every way his work is a revelation, and when combining efforts with the stunning cinematography of Bradford Young, Villeneuve crafts one of the most beautiful films of the year in virtually every sense- aesthetically and emotionally. His sense of scope, scale, composition and flow is just wonderful, and each and every choice he makes is carefully calculated to serve story and character in the best of ways.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Arrival"" emerges as not only a fantastic and stunning work on its own, but easily claims its position as one of the greatest films of 2016. It's an immense achievement in storytelling and drama, and its expert exploration of the science-fiction genre puts it on the same league as classics like ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Yes, it is that good, and I can only hope that the minor degree of backlash from people who have found it ""boring"" or ""confusing"" does not dissuade others from going in with an open mind. Because this film is pure cinematic magic in any and every sense.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10."
"prabhatrayal","10","10","23","21 December 2016"," Arrival is Villeneuve's Magnum Opus
","Arrival is a rare gem from Denis Velleneuve, who has proved many times that he is the next big thing. If you look at his track record, you won't find anything bad. He is an amazing director who has the ability to create tension and make you uncomfortable. If you do not believe me, go and watch Incendies, Prisoners or Sicario. With Arrival, he tried his hands on a new genre and did he deliver? He absolutely did.<br/><br/>Arrival is a Science Fiction featuring Aliens (duh). But while most of the Alien invasion films focus more on the Aliens and visual spectacles, Arrival is the exact opposite. It focuses more on the humans instead of the Aliens. It is the story of Louise (Amy Adams) who is a linguist and is grief stricken by the death of her daughter. One day, 12 Alien Pods appear out of nowhere at 12 different locations on earth. They do not wreak havoc like they do in most of the Hollywood films. We are tired of seeing that countless times, thanks to Independence day. They just appear and that's all. Now the big question is why are they here? Well, that is the plot of the film, even the poster has it written at the center, in all caps. The whole movie is about finding the answer to this question. I would not spoil it for you but let me tell you one thing; If you love challenging films, this film is a treat for you. If you do not and hate slow movies then skip it, please. This movie explores many interesting ideas and is quite thought provoking. It also deals with many themes, especially of free will vs fate. The way the Aliens communicate in this film is very interesting too. Their language is made up of weird circles that they form using their tentacles. It results in some very interesting ideas about time. OK, I am revealing too much so I'll just stop here.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous. The first shot that shows the Pod for the first time in its full view is breathtaking; most of the shots are. Bradford Young has done a brilliant job in creating tension with the help of visuals. But it could not have been possible without the amazing music by Johann Johannsson. Man, that background score scared me more than the visuals. It was kind of ..different?<br/><br/>Now, lets talk about Amy Adams who delivers a powerhouse of a performance here. No one gets five Oscar nods for nothing. She is one of my favorite actresses and her work in this film is tremendous. She played her role of a grief stricken mother perfectly, no complains at all. It's only because of her performance that this film becomes much more than a Sci-Fi. It has an emotional impact on you. Jeremmy Renner did not have much to do but he was good at whatever he did.<br/><br/>So, I can say that Arrival is one of the best Science Fiction films of the decade, if not the best. I loved is mostly because it was different. It is a Science Fiction with a soul. I have watched a film after four or five months and I am happy that I watched this."
"vexyl","10","10","23","2 December 2016"," SF Masterpiece
","I watched Arrival two times and the second time was even better than the first. With all the knowledge about the story line you can see how great Arrival really is. Everything fits perfect together and you realize how much you missed because you assumed some kind of linear time line. A truly non-linear (or circular) time line is what will also solve all your logic problems (especially the Chinese general).<br/><br/>That said every movie messing up with time is basically fiction. To our current knowledge the only existing time is present. Past is a shadow of a time once existed heavily processed and manipulated by the human brain and future is basically the same ... a prediction based on the past. Every time you remember an event in you past your brain will overwrite this event with the copy you just remembered so most of the time you remember a copy of a copy of a copy etc ... of your past. If you want to enjoy this movie you have to accept something that seems unreal to us but that's the definition of SF.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is great ... acting, music, sound, editing, visuals,story. Imho it is the best Hollywood movie 2016 and it will become a SF classic. Watch it in cinema because directing, cinematography and sound are exceptional and build an unique atmosphere comparable to Fincher or Mann movies."
"aweynand96","9","10","23","22 November 2016"," What a beautiful piece of science fiction.
","In an age where sci-fi movies can just as easily be horrendous as they can be wonderful, it can be a gamble going to the theater. I didn't have much expectations going in to see ""Arrival"", but I think that was to my benefit last night. What a unique, thoughtful film this was.<br/><br/>Essentially, Amy Adams plays knowledgeable university linguist Louise Banks and Jeremy Renner plays her physicist foil. Forest Whitaker plays their skeptical boss and does great in his own right. One day, a dozen colossal alien spacecraft appear at seemingly random locations across the globe, and we tag along the Americans as they attempt to communicate with the visitors, all while also trying to maintain conversation between the other divided nations. I won't spoil anything else - that's sufficient enough information to walk into the film excited.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the visuals are great, the tension is towering; I found myself feeling terrified for the humans engaging the aliens and the entire scene where the main cast first enters the ""shell"" is one of the greatest uses of suspense I've seen since ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". The actors did well to convey their sense of utter wonder and fear and I felt enveloped in mankind's anxiety for first contact. And the SCORE, it was just beautiful... Dvorak composed some gorgeous work and you may also recognize the palindromic music from Shutter Island in the beginning and end sequences.<br/><br/>This is an example of what I call an ""efficient"" film; nothing goes to waste. Every line of dialogue, every clue, every image serves a purpose and it delivers such an incredible punch towards the finale that you can't help but feel compensated. This really is what makes the film stand out from the rest of science fiction - it's moving creative, and non-gratuitous, and it earns every tear and clap the audience emits. It's so difficult to combine something as significant as a worldwide alien appearance with raw, deserved human emotion and somehow still make sense. I loved all of it, from start to finish (and back again).<br/><br/>Go and see ""Arrival"". Have as little expectations as possible, for you might be disappointed if you're hoping for a ""Battle: Los Angeles"" or even something reminiscent of ""Contact"". Let yourself be swathed by the movie, drink in what it says about human beings, relationships, time, and language. Congratulations Villeneuve, you've created a masterclass piece of science fiction.<br/><br/>9/10."
"gjc278","10","10","23","19 November 2016"," I expected a lot and got more
","The trailer for Arrival led me to expect a humans-meet-aliens-and- some-people-misunderstand-their-benevolence movie like Contact. I was expecting deep human drama in the face of ""the other"" and a well- acted, well-shot movie. I got those things, they were delivered well. <br/><br/>What I wasn't expecting was the twist. What does one expect when humans meet alien visitors: 1. they turn out to be hostile and war breaks out (e.g., Independence Day), 2. they turn out to be friendly we have a common enemy (e.g. Transformers), 3. They turn out to be benign or benevolent and we get along (e.g., the Star Trek movie with first contact with the Vulcans). 4. They aliens are neither good or bad but the humans are bad to them (e.g., Alien Nation, or District 9). Without an explicit spoiler, Arrival is closest to ""3"", while not being like any other alien contact movie I've ever seen. It's hard to have a genuinely new angle and new twist, but there is one for this genre. I absolutely love this movie, even if it did leave me with tears streaming from my eyes for the last 5 minutes."
"Schwag09","9","10","23","12 November 2016"," Thought-provoking
","Arrival is a study of the human condition. It's an exploration of wonder and perception. A thought-provoking release of mental shackles. What if you could explore time in the same manner you do an uncharted forest? If your entire life was laid out before you, and you were free to tour all the untold moments, would you embrace each and every one of them? Arrival stems from a simple premise, a set of unidentified objects appearing to contain intelligent life have landed on Earth. As we see humanity's reaction to this event unfold we are slowly drawn in and forced to reevaluated everything we have learned.<br/><br/>Louise (Amy Adams) is a fiercely intelligent linguistics professor. She maintains the facade of a solitary lifestyle and leaves us pondering her past. This all comes to a crashing halt the day they arrive. Louise is pulled into a world of mystery and wonder. She's forced to draw upon everything she's learned, which takes a tole on her mentally and emotionally. If language is the pillar with which we've built our civilization, then Louise is a masterful architect. Her interactions with this foreign species are broken down with mathematical precision. Despite this we're also shown a calm, caring side. She slowly builds rapport as communication between the two species begins to take form.<br/><br/>Ian (Jeremy Renner) is a charming theoretical physicist. He and Louise are tasked with forming a means of communication with the unknown visitors. He's often the yin to Louise's yang. Her emotional intelligence and deep thought combined with his rigor and attention to detail flourish in investigating the task at hand. The two are also inexplicably drawn to one another. It's as if they've both been traveling their whole lives to meet at this moment in time.<br/><br/>Arrival leaves us with more questions than answers. We're left in awe as the story methodically unfolds before us. It's a slow build, but not one that leaves us with time to wander. The pacing and structure of the film are done to perfection. We can't help but feel as though these events are happening right before our very eyes. Denis Villeneuve masterfully controls our attention. The cinematography and score are awe-inspiring, which we've almost come to expect from his films. Amy Adams truly shines in this breakout role. We've seen glimpses of her excellence in the past, but this is something entirely different. From beginning to end she is a powerful force on the screen. Arrival is the kind of movie that will make you step outside and stare at the stars with childhood wonder. It will inspire conversation and provoke thought. Arrival is a film and an experience, but above all else it is a question – what if?"
"Alric_","10","6","12","17 November 2018"," Masterpiece, maybe not for everyone
","I wasted an hour reading some of the negative reviews. Most of the 1-stars fall into a couple of buckets:<br/><br/>A) They didn't pay attention, asking questions or pointing out ""holes"" that are clearly addressed in the movie. These people are just wrong and/or don't like movies that require focus.<br/><br/>B) They don't understand the actual point of the movie. These ones are more understandable - but still wrong, IMO. In their defense, the marketing did make this seem more action-oriented.<br/><br/>The point a lot of folks are missing is that this isn't really a story about aliens. Aliens and first contact are used to tell a story about how humans conceptualize time.<br/><br/>The great tragedy that we must experience time linearly.<br/><br/>The realization that experiencing time non-linearly would come with its own heartbreaking consequences.<br/><br/>IMO, Arrival is fundamentally a thought-piece on Kierkegaard's famous quote: ""Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.""<br/><br/>I can see why it'd be offputting to expect an action-packed alien flick and instead get a cerebral contemplation on the nature of time. That doesn't change that it's a masterpiece."

","As stated in this title, this movie was entertaining for the most part, but the sum was tainted by one major, glaring flaw. The dramatic tension relied upon humanity's warmongering nature and stupidity overwhelming their senses enough to a completely self- destructive degree. Humanity considering attacking a superior force out of fear is plausible, but not after several months of peaceful coexistence - that is plenty of time for those lingering fears to vanish. Even the sensationalist media couldn't drive an ""alien invader"" narrative that long without any real evidence to suggest that to be the case. With that in mind, their attempts at dramatic tension not only fell flat, but it detracted from what is otherwise a great film. I really enjoyed everything else in the movie and would have given it a 9/10 happily, but that one suspension-of-disbelief destroying trait (which was probably only injected into the movie for the sake of poorly trying to keep the lowest common denominator interested) detracted from the movie enough to drop it down to a generous 4/10."

Just another alien movie where the writers drew too heavily on what WE know. An alien movie should start from what we don't know and the questions we have about what we don't know.

To some the notion that one word could be used for both hello and goodbye is a bridge too far. The notion that one can dislodge ones perceptual anchor that delineates and orders past, present, and future is beyond startling. The idea that one could learn to exist on both sides of a perceptual interface and tease out the basis for communication is even more extraordinary. <br/><br/>In many ways this film, ostensibly about how one species can learn to communicate with another, speaks to us as much if not more about how we learn to communicate with ourselves.

Her character has no emotion in this movie and pretty much has the attitude of a sponge the whole entire film. So in my opinion i say save your money this is a super overrated film."
"cold_drive888","7","6","12","10 December 2016"," I don't believe this film lived up to the hype **spoilers***
","I gave this film a 7 because it is visually stunning, well-acted, and the premise --while is what ultimately disappointed me-- is very unique and interesting. <br/><br/>However, for starters, this film felt way too truncated. The aliens speak a highly complex language using ink-blotters and it is never explained how they finally understand the language - they just suddenly do... out of no where. There wasn't even an aha! moment. They literally went from saying ""this could take a hundred years to decipher,"" which is believable considering the language is entirely different than any human language, to just suddenly understanding it fluently. <br/><br/>That's not even my biggest gripe. What really disappointed me was that the ""language"" didn't just give them a better understanding of reality or a more efficient way to communicate, it literally gave them the ability to defy physics. I've always been intrigued by the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis but I never suspected differences in language could give you metaphysical powers.<br/><br/>And I love space/science-fiction movies! Interstellar is one of my favorite movies and I love the Martian and the 5th Element. I can suspend my disbelief very well, I just can't make ridiculous leaps in logic like this film tried to have me do."

The photography, the visual effects and the production design are all exquisite and imaginative. There is nothing small or mean or thrown at you in this movie.

""An alien ship lands on the ground and a linguist is called to try to communicate with her,"" yeah, that synopsis can fool you, and a lot. The linguist in question is Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), in trying to communicate with these extraterrestrials she ends up learning to see the world in another way ... Technically the film is also incredible, with many scenes of filming in off , Spike Jonze style, he plays the melodramatic way flawlessly and with a beautiful photograph, mixes and beautiful soundtrack, the film places Denis Villeneuve as one of the biggest names in the new generation of cinema that is emerging, and is not For less, Denis is spectacular, we must also talk about the acting, Amy Adams is incredible, perfectly interpreting all the news and dramas that passes his Louise. Finally, ""The arrival"" is a good news, it is a film that goes beyond its two hours, is a film that goes beyond that cheap science fiction, it has a message, even if we could change the bad things that happened in our Lives, it would not be worth it, because it is these things that build the human being, Congratulations Denis Villeneuve."

","Denis Villeneuve, justifiably hailed for his work on 'Sicario', 'Prisoners', 'Incendies', 'Enemy' (with some amazing sci-fi tropes that make this a companion piece to that, in my humble opinion), has quite possibly made 1 of the best sci-fi movies in decades (once again, imho - since there's something that happens during the movie that has kinda divided audiences majorly, even prompting walkouts in a showing I was at - something which I was initially skeptical of, but that grew on me as time passed by, making me a champion of sorts for its right now). <br/><br/>This one's been compared both to Nolans' 'Interstellar' and Zemeckis' 'Contact', but I feel it stands above the latter, and comes very close to being on par with, or slightly better than, the former. There is an element within the screenplay that you know belongs here, which plays out in a typical fashion, but the ultimate payoff, which divided audiences, & confused some, occurs towards the very end. Also, another observation made by unkind / unempathetic audience- members was that the epilogue goes on for too long, but, imho, it perfectly capped all that came before, making this more human (or species- centric, considering the subject-matter) than your average sci-fi flick. <br/><br/>The locations, effects, cinematography & editing perfectly complement the crisp, sharp narrative throughout, and every department in this flick has made Oscar-worthy contributions this year, I do hope they are recognized for their efforts. <br/><br/>The Leftovers ' Max Richter makes his presence felt in both the beginning & end credits, & the overall score by Johann Johannsson elevates each sequence it's used in. The sound design complements the score perfectly, life it's wont to, especially in Villeneuve's works, specific examples being 'Sicario' & 'Prisoners'.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker plays a no-nonsense stock role here and makes it his own, as does Coens' regular Michael 'A Serious man' Stuhlbarg, and they both bring their respective gravitas to (imho, underwritten/stock) roles and yet perform well, but this movie belongs to Amy Adams, whole & soul (supported ably by Jeremy Renner, but this one's is all about Abbott & Costello, heh-heh); but more on her later. <br/><br/>I do wish there was more of Renner's character (I've read someplace that many scenes with him in it were edited out, & I do hope we get to see a few of those on the Blu-Ray at least, if possible, in- sequence, though the theatrical cut in this instance is supposed to be the director's cut, from all accounts). <br/><br/>I fondly looked back at first having watched Amy Adams in 'Junebug' & 'Enchanted' (interestingly, she's also got 'Disenchanted' coming out soon) around 8 years previously, when I was sure that this actress was gonna go places, and boy, she sure has, if you include her work in this alongside her efforts in movies like 'American Hustle', 'Doubt', 'The Fighter', 'The Master', 'Sunshine Cleaning' (to be fair, I loved Emily Watson's character better in that one, though Adams was the lead, along with the gr8gr8 Alan Arkin), 'Miss Pettigrew lives for a day', 'Julie/Julia', 'Big Eyes', 'Trouble with the curve' (a flawed work to be sure, but she was 1 of the best things about it); and in spite of being miscast in many paycheck movies ('Night at the museum', 'Man of steel', 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'). Absolutely looking forward to her being cast along with Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Sheen & Isla Fisher in the upcoming 'Nocturnal Animals'. <br/><br/>It might have helped to understand more about the non- linear part of the paradox that is the central conceit of the flick. Kinda making it a companion-piece to the sci-fi cult classic, 'Primer'.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'll be watching this one many times more. Lookin' forward to those viewings. <br/><br/>Having seen this, I'm now quite sure that the sequel to Ridley's Scott's cult-classic 'Blade Runner' is in the right hands with Villeneuve. Can't wait."
"D-Defoe","1","6","12","25 November 2016"," Subzero entertainment, meaning the suspense got lost in the vacuum of space
","First, I left the movie after 57 min as it was unsupportable. My lesson: never go to a movie at a last moment decision, especially if you read ""SciFi"" and a well known ACTION movie actor, as Jeremy Renner is, on the movie poster, as this could be a fake.<br/><br/>Why did I leave so early ? Because I have seen so many movies in my life that I did not expect it to become better and reading the negative comments on IMDb afterwards I got assured doing the right thing.<br/><br/>The movie started already with a dull,foreboding background music reminding me of the gray, clouded days in wintertime on a Monday morning where you have to wake up at 05.00am and prepare to go to work. Always a bad sign for a non-interesting movie for me. Amy Adams plays a supposedly talented linguist, who 2 years ago did work on a top secret mission for the US government to translate Farsi (the language spoken in Iran). And she lost her only child, which we see in many flashbacks. Then the aliens land, on 12 worldwide spots. She learns about this while teaching a bunch of students. The emotional levels of the students and hers about this incident were like mine about this movie: nonexistent. The worst acting I have seen for a while, beginners level of acting. Now to the dumbness of the seen first 57min before I left the cinema:<br/><br/>-after the announcement of alien encounter, almost no one seems to be really frightened, worried, running around, astonished or whatever, it seems like life goes on as it always did. Is this logical ?<br/><br/>-the colonel plays a 1 min audio recording with alien language out of the blue sky and expects the linguist Amy to decipher it in less than two minutes otherwise he goes for another linguist. Is this logical ?<br/><br/>-the big upright floating pebble stones (alien ships) come from whatever planet to earth, have sophisticated anti gravity, but are unable to build up communication in a sensible way ? Why do the have a 90 degree inverted gravity in the entrance tunnel 10 m straight above the ground. They could have landed on the flat pebble side, save combustible and make the entrance for the humans easier as gravity would be then parallel to the earth's gravity. <br/><br/>-While I would have been staring in awe at the spaceship, emotionless linguist Amy passes by on arrival uninterested as if she was used to these sightings. Maybe she plays an autistic ?<br/><br/><ul><li>Amy and Jeremy Renner (the physicist) are being let to enter the spaceship without any introduction and preparation,on what they might expect (differing gravity, alien appearance...) ? </li></ul><br/><br/>-What the heck was the chirping bird's role in the cage in the situation of encounter ? Why did Amy not introduce the bird first instead of herself ? ""B-i-r-d, bird"" <br/><br/><ul><li>Wow! The floating ""octopussies"" were in fact ""HEPTAPODS"" ! (7 legs) This revelation in suspense was almost unbearable ! (How many legs did the Independence day ""calamares"" have ? Were they somehow relatives, as they also had some 12 flying saucers landing around the world) </li></ul><br/><br/>-""Contact"" Jodie Foster,...uh, ""Arrival"" shaky-hands-constantly-panting-Amy Adams removes her exposure suit just to show her face to the eyeless ""heptapod"" ? Why did she not take a big pin-up poster and stick it to the glass panel with her signature under it? Maybe also an alphabet and numbers poster with a Rosetta stone ""Easy learning-English"" audio-recording. Would have saved them a few trips inside the ship. Do names really enhance the understanding of foreign languages ? ""Me Tarzan, this Jane"" Response: ""OO"" <br/><br/>-The ""O"" Rohrschach-Circles must have been developed by a famous ""heptapod"" psychologist. Have I mentioned earlier why the further developed foreign race who visits earth does not make first language attempts and waits instead for the inferior race to struggle for it ? But on the other hand first-world tourists to the third-world-countries also expect the host country to speak in the visitors language. <br/><br/>-How much I longed for a human nuclear-rocket-attack or something exploding, but this wish was not fulfilled in the 57 min. <br/><br/>-The production expenses for this movie must have been below 1 million, as it played in a cemented tunnel, in a military barrack, in a university, in someone's garden and somewhere on a green field. The cgi for a floating pebble stone a two ""heptapods"" was below nowadays computer games. <br/><br/>-imdb ratings are flooded by false high ranking comments and votes since the last decade, with assumed, paid 10.000 to 20.000 ""false"" voters. IMDb ratings have lost their ground for me. This movie is definitely not a place 98 of top 250 movie, as it is junk. Even ""Contact"" was more exciting. -People, be warned, this was the first movie EVER, where I left the cinema before the end, because it was endlessly boring. <0/10"
"dsg-19930","5","6","12","14 November 2016"," Arrival disappoints due to a poor plot and an anticlimactic ending
","While this film has a good musical score it is weakened by its use of cliché sci-fi themes, a flawed plot, and an anti-climatic ending. This movie uses very cliché sci-fi themes. For instance, the idea of alien space ships orbiting or hovering over the earth occurs in many other well-known and recent sc-fi movies like Independence day, oblivion, the day the earth stood still, etc. Also, these space-ships just arriving out of thin air shows a lack of creativity by the film producers. <br/><br/>One of the major flaws of this film is that the main actress starts having flashbacks of her dying child. She has these flashbacks before even encountering the aliens. However, towards the end of the movie we discover that these flashbacks are actually flashforwards. However, if she was having these flashforwards about someone she does not know, she would have a very definite reaction to these experiences. The fact that she has these experiences without any sort of reaction should indicate she is hallucinating, probably due to a hallucinogenic drug. Any normal person who has numerous visions of someone they do not even know would have some sort of reaction and ask himself or herself ""who is this strange person I am having a vision of?,"" but the actress does not react in such a way, which is quite absurd. It's like she's so dumb she actually thinks to herself, ""oh cool look at all these memories of a daughter I didn't know I had."" In short, the film's use of these flashbacks/flashforwards was nonsensical, was a poorly thought out way to add emotional significance to the film, and undermined the coherence of the movie plot.<br/><br/>The whole time-travel idea in this film is very problematic. If she has a vision of herself in the future speaking to the Chinese General and asking him what she is supposed to say in that moment and what his phone number is, then that makes no sense. If the General gives her his phone number in the future, which she uses in the past, it would make the upcoming future the past and the current past the upcoming future, because we are to believe that receiving information in the future is informing the past. Thus, the whole time directionality used in this film is confusing. <br/><br/>Another major flaw of this film is that it would be unlikely for an Army Colonel to seek assistance from a civilian interpreter when the military already employs interpreters. To assume that the military does not employ highly skilled military and civilian interpreters is preposterous. Moreover, numerous DoD agencies employ interpreters. It is thus doubtful that the military would seek an interpreter who has occasionally worked with the military or DoD where there are numerous interpreters who are fully employed by these organizations.<br/><br/>The ending of this film was very anticlimactic. It was a serious letdown when the Chinese General decides to just withdraw his forces and the alien ships disappear. At least let a few missiles out. Throw some grenades. Launch a nuke or two. There was absolutely no action in this film, which was disappointing. <br/><br/>The best part of this film was the musical score. I liked the music. Also another positive in this film is that the aliens are not bipedal, because aliens are always bipedal in pretty much every other sci-fi alien film. I'm glad the aliens in this film have a lot more legs to stand on.<br/><br/>I also found the fact that the aliens were able to expel some sort of dye to communicate quite interesting. I'm not quite sure if it was more like a fart or something else though."

","I think the term ""thought provoking"" is often overused when describing things. For me, a film fits that description when it causes me to keep thinking about the film's message long after the credits roll; when it open my mind to a new way of observing or thinking about the world.<br/><br/>If you only watched the few half an hour or so of Arrival, you may conclude that it is a run-of-the-mill movie about alien contact and its impact on human society. Yawn. But if you watch the movie all the way to the end, Arrival reveals itself to be something far, far greater than that.<br/><br/>Arrival's aliens, the heptapods, are not a stereotypical hollywood alien race. They don't ""arrive"" to conquer, or to introduce us to the rest of the galaxy. They arrive to give humanity a gift: A new way of perceiving time. Even if that gift can only be truly experienced by Louise, the main character, ""Arrival"" gives the audience an opportunity to try to truly understand simultaneous awareness.<br/><br/>This is Arrival's core strength. It offers a truly deep examination of what it would be like to experience all of our lives at once. It explores how that changed mode of awareness would affect our language, our mathematics, and our choices.<br/><br/>There are many, many differences between Arrival and the short it is based on, ""Story of your life,"" but Arrival manages to masterfully adapt the short's core message to the form of a film.<br/><br/>Oh, and it doesn't hurt that the acting, cinematography, music, and direction are all stellar as well."

It is the glue that holds a people together. It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict"" - Arrival 2016.<br/><br/>But how come the ""foundation of civilization"" is used as a weapon? Deaf-mute people are still parts of the society, and civilization is an integration of social act basically. Thus it seems to me that there are serious mistakes in ""Arrival"" movie, it mixes the ideas of civilization, culture, language, technological achievements, and of intelligence; to reach a funny conclusion: learning an alien language can make people able to control time flow. So it misunderstands the ideas of physics as well.<br/><br/>More annoying thing in the story, is to indicate that there is nothing wrong in knowing the exact date at which we will lose the most loved ones.

","I have to admit, I was a little bit disappointed with this movie. This was touted as one of the best and most intelligent sci-fi movies of the year, and it didn't quite live up to all that praise. It's not a bad movie though. The acting is solid, the directing, sound design and visuals are really good. But the story is kind of bland. For a movie that is all about communication, I thought it was a little bit odd that the most obvious way of communication (pictures) was completely ignored. The movie also depicts Russia and China as paranoid villains, while America of course saves the day. In light of history, this is hard to believe. It is also very difficult to believe that China, a country whose alphabet is literally a bunch of pictures, would not try to communicate with pictures, and instead is presented as the aggressor against the aliens. In the end, the climax of the movie is basically one big Deux Ex Machina, and that is a tough pill to swallow. Could they not have thought of a resolution that was a little bit more clever, and not the equivalent of pulling a rabbit out of a hat? The whole movie is about communication, so shouldn't the movie end with a break through in communication? So while this is not a bad movie, it's not a very good sci-fi movie.

"maflatoon","10","7","15","20 February 2017"," Arrival is a thing of beauty.
","*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>Arrival is a 2016 American science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve and adapted by Eric Heisserer from the 1998 short story, ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang. It stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner,and Forest Whitaker. Amy Adams plays the role of Louise Banks- a linguist who teaches at a College. One day, twelve giant spacecrafts appear in random locations across the world spreading panic and chaos everywhere. Louise is recruited by US Army for her linguistic skills along with mathematician and theoretical physicist Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) - to attempt to decode and translate the language that the creatures inside the spacecrafts are using in order to prevent a global war. Arrival focuses on the struggle to communicate with the creatures (dubbed ""Heptapods""), and what the aftermath of this could lead to should it not go to plan. The film dives into the philosophy of language and human interaction and how it can be used to communicate with extra terrestrial beings in case of first contact. Arrival is a film that is more than just about language. It shows how divided we are as a species as each nation and culture interprets the alien's language in different meanings. And from this lack of clear understanding it creates fear and paranoia that could lead to global war. But Arrival shows that despite the mystery that surrounds the unknown, the future can be just as hopeful and bright as it might be scary and we should approach it with confidence. ] Amy Adams as Louise Banks is superb and plays the role perfectly. Her performance is truly Oscar worthy in this film. As the LA Times rightly puts it, ""Arrival is really Adams's film, a showcase for her ability to quietly and effectively meld intelligence, empathy and reserve."" It was really surprising to see her snubbed form Oscar nominations. Renner is also solid, and accompanies Adams nicely, even if he can't help but feel woefully overshadowed. Arrival is nearly perfect in all technical aspects too. Music by Jóhann Jóhannsson is terrific and fits perfectly in the films environment. The cinematography (by Bradford Young) is breathtaking and really mesmerizes the viewer successfully acting as a perfect match to the tone of each sequence. The large pitch black objects hovering over the cities feel instantly dark and threatening, and the brief sights of the creatures we're given reveal something wholly original. In terms of technicalities and aesthetic, Arrival is a thing of beauty. Rating: 5/5<br/><br/>Best quote: ""Despite knowing the journey and where it leads. I embrace it. And I welcome every moment of it."" - Dr. Louise Banks"

","Dare I say that? Yes I do.<br/><br/>It really affected me. This is a movie for those fascinated by language, the future and past, andextraterrestrial lifeforms from sci fi stories like X-files, Contact, and ET.<br/><br/>You have to be a little bit religious to fully appreciate this story, but more so you have to be interested in linguistics, something that only some of us appreciate. So try to open your mind a bit while watching this if you're not so interested in these two concepts. This movie also includes future and past, so try to open your mind to time, the 4th dimension.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the story for you, instead, I'd recommend to open your mind to the concepts above. Its rare I add a review on IMDb. This was worth your time reading, I hope.<br/><br/>One of the most beautiful phrases I've ever heard, was said in Chinese in this film. The meaning is there for you to understand once you have researched the film some after watching it. I recommend not reading on google about this movie before you see it. You'll thank me later."

","Arrival is the story of Humanity's first contact with an alien species that shows itself by stationing twelve objects at different locations around the planet. Amy Adams is a linguist who is assigned to attempt communication with the aliens.<br/><br/>There are many things I love about this movie. If this was a sci-fi book this would be called Hard Sci-Fi. Based somewhat in reality and real science. The story moves at its own pace. There is a definite tension throughout. But, along with that is a feeling of wonderment. How would we speak to alien species that has little or nothing in common with us? And, as the film's tagline asks, why are they here?<br/><br/>There is little to no physical action in this film. There is violence, but it is off screen for the most part.. That being said, I never felt bored or lost. The story moves in the dialogue and the actions of the characters in the story. This is a smart movie. It doesn't spoon feed the audience with TOO many details or nuance. You may have to fill in a few holes with your imagination. Which, honestly, could hurt how someone feels about this movie. <br/><br/>The plot moves very well leading into the finale. I was completely satisfied with the resolution/revelation at the end of the film. If you are expecting an alien mothership/ Death Star exploding action climax..you may be disappointed. But if something a bit more cerebral and heartfelt is more to your liking...you may be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is GREAT in her leading role as linguist Louise Banks. Her journey, physically, emotionally and mentally carries the movie. Jeremy Renner, Forrest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg all shine in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>Besides Denis Villenueve's amazing directing ( He continues to impress after Enemy, Prisoners and Sicario) I have to give praise to Bradford Young's cinematography and Johann Johannsson's music. This is a beautiful film to look at and the soundtrack is stellar.<br/><br/>Arrival, at the moment is tied for my favorite film of the year along with Moonlight. Two movies at first glance that may have nothing in common. But, on a deeper level they are two sides of a coin. The celebration of the human spirit and the ability, despite our flaws and foibles, to become something better than what we are."

It's well shot, great camera work, good CGI, it seems realistic enough in general for a first contact scenario to possibly happen like this. It's not over the top action, it's more like reality than Hollywood. The pace is perfect and not at all boring and the twist about the the lead lady's ability to see the future is effective.<br/><br/>One of the best alien films I have ever seen."
"Victoria_Elenor","10","5","10","11 November 2018"," Do NOT be fooled by bad reviews
","I'm gonna try say this in a nicest way as possible; it requires a bit of IQ to truly appreciate this film and you need to be able to love films who has a substancial plot and not just a typical alien film with lots of explosions and people arguing about survival.<br/><br/>I was SO surprised by so many bad reviews, until I realised everyone of them had pretty much the same argument: it's boring.<br/><br/>Let me tell you this: if you think this movie is boring, then you probably can't appreciate this masterpiece on an interlectual level! This film reaches out to ALL the typical cliche questions I've ever had in alien film: why do alien always have to be resembling us? How come they can live and breathe the same air as us - who says they didn't evolve in different conditions than us? And why are they either more interlectual than us, or just savage beasts? And the most important one: WHY do they always understand us or conveniently have technology that can translate our speech? And WHY do they always have to use a mouth and speech or sounds like we do? Whose to say there's not an entirely different way of communicating in outer space that humans quite simply cannot comprehend?<br/><br/>ENTER ARRIVAL!!!!!!<br/><br/>Arrival is so complex and so wonderfully well written. I've studied linguistics myself and the approach during this film was absolutely, mind-glowingly amazing. They take everything we know about math, science and linguistics to a new level. I found that watching this film the second time is even better. I really enjoy how this is a film that is fully aware of what genre it's in, and creates some typical settings that the audience is familiar with, but brings in a whole new and quite original approach! And most importantly: it actually made sense out of what it was trying to do. It is fiction, yes, but so well written that it truly makes you believe that the language studied in the film is just another unknown language humans don't know about!<br/><br/>Please don't be fooled by these bad reviews I saw! If you're just into action and brain dead films that doesn't make you use your brain a little, then this is probably not for you.<br/><br/>But if you enjoy a true masterpiece that makes you think and reflect, and which stays in your mind hours after you watched it, then you'll love it!!<br/><br/>Had to give 10 stars because this film might just have made it to the top of my favourite alien genre films!"

In fact, they gave it all away. Perhaps it was just too predictable. The final 15 minutes could have been omitted completely. Sure, not every movie is made for geniuses, but don't try to make smart movies for the dumbest of people, please.<br/><br/>And China as the main protagonist until the American woman somehow changes his heart?

"dutchs-1","8","5","10","13 December 2016"," This will not be easy
","The always agreeable Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are two scientists tasked with communicating with the inhabitants of mysterious ships that suddenly appeared over the earth. No shoot-em-ups or explosions (except one). The aliens are seriously alien looking and have a symbolic written language which Adams slowly deciphers. The film mostly deals with the painfully slow process of sorting the alien language out. Meanwhile the rest of the earth freaks out. The U.S. is blessed with the usual crop of conspiracy bloggers, while Russia and China start to get itchy trigger fingers. The way Adams defuses the global crisis involves a mind-warping temporal loop, and would make a great and emotionally satisfying ending. Unfortunately, there's a sappy coda tacked on that contributes nothing and seriously detracts from the emotional impact of the film. We step back from the brink of interstellar war, humanity's better impulses win by a razor thin margin, the aliens leave in peace, leaving their language, which may hold the key to radically new concepts, and instead of ending on a hopeful and triumphant note, the film makers resort to an ending with the emotional impact of a damp sponge."

","Very well made overall and I went in completely unspoiled. The language stuff was highly fascinating because it felt really new and like a genuine exploration of some powerful questions.<br/><br/>However.<br/><br/>This thing has gotta be looked at for being one of the all-time rip offs. By the middle when it became obvious what narrative convention they were using, I actually shouted out ""She's Desomond!"" in the theater. If you have seen Star Trek: The Next Generation episode ""All Good Things..."" or its sister episode of Lost ""The Constant,"" you've already seen this movie. <br/><br/>Great performances and pretty solid if you haven't watched science fiction television the past 20 years, but my god, it's a rip off."
"bhartman36","4","5","10","6 December 2016"," Interesting Premise, Badly Executed
","All of the reviews I'd read of this were good (although I hadn't yet checked IMDb) so I had high hopes for this movie. Maybe that was my first mistake.<br/><br/>I can't complain about any of the acting. All of the actors, including Adams and Renner, did good job with what the were given. It really felt like they bought into the story.<br/><br/>My problem was the story itself, and the way it was told.<br/><br/>Aliens come to Earth in 12 different ships, hovering over apparently random points. So far, so good. The 12 countries involved in the landings (or hoverings, I guess) send out people to communicate with the aliens. Amy Adams plays the American linguist sent to communicate with them. A good deal of the movie is spent trying to determine the aliens' purpose for coming to Earth (as you might expect). <br/><br/>Here's where we get into spoiler territory:<br/><br/>The aliens' purpose in coming to Earth is to teach us their language, so that we can experience time in a non-linear way. The problem with this, from a movie point of view, is that the movie picks up after the main character gets this ability, rather than before (to the extent that ""before"" and ""after"" have any meaning, when you're talking about time being circular). <br/><br/>How does this affect the movie? Wel, for me, it felt like 75% of the movie was Groundhog Day, just watching the same things happen over and over for no reason. When the reason for this is finally revealed at the end, it's interesting, but not interesting enough to justify sitting through it.<br/><br/>Beside the narrative structure, there are plot problems. Why do the aliens send 12 ships, with the message in 12 parts? Can't the aliens just send one ship, and send out the message in one piece? If the point of the contact is to allow us to see time in a circular way, what purpose does sending out the message in pieces serve? And if the aliens can see the future as easily as the past, wouldn't they *know* the problems that approach would have? And finally, how does learning a written language get you to experience time differently? That doesn't make a lot of sense. And why does only Amy Adams' character get the ability at first, when they've all been learning together?<br/><br/>It's an interesting movie at first blush, but it doesn't stand up to a lot of scrutiny."
"murtaza_mma","4","5","10","28 November 2016"," Boring and inconsequential film that tries to look down on its viewers
","I wish Arrival was half as good as critics around the world are projecting it to be. Hailing a movie as a masterpiece just because it is different is pretty much the worst thing that art connoisseurs can do.<br/><br/>Apparently, the critics are raving about the Sci-Fi film because it takes a departure from Hollywood style of filmmaking. But departure alone is not enough. A movie should first and foremost succeed in elucidating the subject at hand for the audiences to the last detail. Arrival, for example, talks about certain symbols that the aliens seem to use and the protagonist who is a language expert slowly learns them but the viewers are never afforded that luxury. Right from the onset film assumes that the viewers are incapable of understanding such intellectual stuff. I mean our two protagonists are supposed to be two of the most intelligent professionals on the planet earth. One is a world renowned language expert and the other is a theoretical physicist. What is the probability in the world that an average viewer would be able to match that intellect? Well, for your kind information, that same average viewer has paid for the ticket. Some of the most intellectual characters ever created, including Sherlock Holmes, never let things unexplained for the lesser mortals.<br/><br/>I don't claim to be as intelligent as Robert Langdon or Hannibal Lector, but I like to see myself as an intelligent film viewer and so I would like a filmmaker who tries to indulge me and not a filmmaker who doesn't think me capable enough to understand at least as much as his superintelligent characters. If Tarkovsky or Kubrick never thought lowly of their audiences, what makes Denis Villeneuve to look down upon the viewers? Besides, the film doesn't really offer anything that hasn't been done before in cinema.To make matters worse, it is boring and inconsequential. <br/><br/>The strongest aspect of Arrival is Amy Adams. But she has delivered much stronger and dynamic performances over the years. Hollywood loves to make movies about female characters who look nervous and fidgety to begin with but end up showing remarkable courage in the face of adversities. Can there be an easier way of wooing half the human race? Well, to tell the truth, the female audiences are not gullible and filmmakers cannot fool them. He had attempted something similar in Sicario and he has done it again in Arrival. Hope Denis Villeneuve would be more careful with the Blade Runner sequel.<br/><br/>For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges""."

Arrival stars Amy Adams as linguist Louise Banks who has been brought in by the government to help communicate with the extraterrestrials that have landed twelve ships around the globe; both she and Jeremy Renner's physicist, Ian Donelly must work out why they are here and what they want through their various visits inside a ship that has landed in Montana, USA. invasion movie; if you're walking in expecting some <br/><br/>The story director Denis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer gives us is unique to say the least. Villeneuve's use of close-ups makes it such a personal and intimate story. His wide shots, including an impressive continuous shot, make the locations a gorgeous visual masterpiece to enjoy. All of these are scored amazingly by Jóhann Jóhannsson who's use of vocals in the music gives both an earthly feel but also surrealness to it. Villeneuve's decision when and where to use this music also proves well making impactful scenes and emotional moments.<br/><br/>Of course the directing can't always work on its own but Amy Adams gives one of the best performances I've seen her give. I really can't expand further on that without giving spoilers but things like her reactions to the extraterrestrials and moments towards the end certainly tell me that this was a good casting choice. The other two leads are Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker both of which do a fine job; if you've seen their other work then you know what to expect here, they are both brilliant actors and play their roles just right but Amy Adams certainly steals the show in acting terms.<br/><br/>Now for the plot of the film, I don't really know what to say. It's best to go into Arrival as unaware as you can with just the basic plot details such as the ones I gave earlier. I will however say that Arrival is one of those films that leaves you thinking about it for a couple of days. When the credits roll you just need a moment to ponder over it and piece together some of the revelations you've just had. When a film can do that I respect it. It's concepts of time, language, narrative and humanity is a lot to take in and certainly food for thought.<br/><br/>I will most certainly watch the film again and upon second viewing I will see it differently than before with the knowledge I have. Is it the best film ever made? No, I've seen films that I have enjoyed a lot more and serve my personal tastes better. Arrival will definitely lose some viewers with it's slow burn quality; some may feel it drags and if you're not interested in the art of cinematography and film-making then it will feel even slower to you. And as someone who calls themselves a cinephile, even I was surprised at the gentle pace some of the scenes were going.<br/><br/>In the end Arrival is stunningly beautiful with incredible acting and surreal sounds. It's commentary on stories is one I will remember and if I had to liken it to other films then I'd say some of the vibes I took from it were ones similar to that of Contact, Signs, and Inception. It won't be everyone's cup of tea but an interesting cup of tea it is."
"cschultz-2","9","5","10","13 November 2016"," Arrival is Superb Science Fiction, and More
","Science fiction often works best when used as an allegory or a metaphor, compelling the viewer to become a participant in the story, and to examine his or her own feelings or reactions to the drama on screen or a similar situation which might be occurring in society.<br/><br/>In Paramount Pictures' Arrival, released Friday, a linguist and a theoretical physicist are recruited by US military intelligence when twelve interplanetary vehicles appear simultaneously around the world. The objective of the two civilians is to discern the intentions of the alien visitors, in order that the country is able to respond appropriately. The mission becomes even more critical when the other countries hosting the unexpected visitors begin to react to them with hostility.<br/><br/>Arrival was adapted by screenwriter Eric Heisserer from author Ted Chiang's award-winning novella Story of Your Life, which successfully interwove sentiment and science fiction with the notion that the course of one's life is pre-determined prior to birth. That Heisserer's previous screen writing credits are mostly in peripheral horror pictures such as Lights Out and entries in the Nightmare on Elm Street and Final Destination canons does not necessarily give the viewer an accurate idea of what to expect from Arrival.<br/><br/>Which is to say, the picture works beautifully on all levels. Denis Villeneuve, the director of last year's superb international crime drama Sicario, works with Heisserer to lead the picture with humanity, allowing the science fiction elements to follow in a more effective fashion. Arrival with its complex structure lends credibility to a story which in more sensational hands might've become just another lurid interplanetary shoot-'em-up. As in Chiang's novella, two stories are told simultaneously, but flow together easily and effortlessly to create one large picture.<br/><br/>And the picture's casts works with intelligence and a quiet forcefulness to deliver the message. Amy Adams is a remarkably talented actress who always seems to be standing just short of major international superstardom. Usually found delivering rich and credible performances in movies as diverse as American Hustle and Man of Steel, The Muppets and Disney's Enchanted, Adams as the linguist in Arrival delivers an eminently believable performance in a difficult role which might well be her most multi-dimensional and emotionally-invested characterization to date.<br/><br/>At the time she's persuaded by the government to help determine the intentions of the visitors, Adams' Dr. Louise Banks is recovering from an acutely vulnerable point in her life, unknowing that the very sensitivity caused by a recent devastating experience will provide the key to her ability to communicate with the visitors.<br/><br/>Adams gives persuasive voice to the languages and technical jargon required of the role, but allows her eyes to wordlessly convey a sense of wounded humanity. The viewer feels her emotional pain, and as a result not only wants to see her succeed in her mission, but also is willing to work along with her in order to do so. Intense concentration is required from both the actress and the viewer to realize the picture's considerable impact.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, an underrated actor often found performing in action adventures and comic book adaptations, contributes a previously untapped dimension of bemused authority to his role. As the theoretical physicist working alongside Adams' linguist to interpret the intentions of the alien visitors, Renner does not simply don a pair of eyeglasses to suggest intelligence. Instead, in a role which might've become cartoonish or showy in less-capable hands, Renner works with quiet determination and sly humor to fashion from his role a characterization as vivid as Heisserer's screenplay allows.<br/><br/>Equally persuasive is the always-reliable Forest Whitaker as the US military intelligence colonel who recruits both Adams and Renner to communicate with the otherworldly guests. Whitaker with his sleepy-eyed, good-natured countenance has often during his long career worked successfully as men of conscience struggling to comprehend a difficult situation before erupting into impulsive action.<br/><br/>In Arrival Whitaker delivers another such characterization, and more. I found myself wishing Whitaker had more screen time, but such a wish seems to occur every time he appears in a picture. It's difficult to believe Forest Whitaker's been in films long enough to have delivered finely-crafted performances in such motion picture classics as Platoon and The Color of Money, as well as the title roles of Lee Daniels' The Butler, The Last King of Scotland and Clint Eastwood's Bird, the latter two of which earned him Academy Award recognition.<br/><br/>Arrival represents the entire array of contributing artists working at peak performance, on all levels. The ultimate messages of the picture—that we're all here to help each other, every experience is a good one, and time is all we have—are a hopeful antidote to the pessimism if our times.<br/><br/>Science fiction, when it works well, adapts itself to the age and allows the viewer to interpret the message in his or her own way. The Thing from Another World, It Came from Outer Space and several other alien invasion pictures of the 1950s mirrored the us-versus-them hostility of the post-World War II era. Invasion of the Body Snatchers in 1956 showed us the futility of McCarthyism and the Communist Witch-Hunt. And television's beloved Star Trek and The Twilight Zone during the 1960s mirrored in any number of episodes the dichotomy of advanced civilization juxtaposed with the intolerance and hostility of the times.<br/><br/>It'll be interesting to learn the reaction to Arrival, with its message of cooperation, during a period in time when much of our world seems to be building walls of hostility rather than bridges of communication."

","Arrival is a science fiction film starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Easily one of the most thought-provoking films I have seen since Interstellar, it is a must-see for anyone who enjoys cleverly written sci-fi. However, if you are expecting non-stop action and explosions, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>In random locations around the world, twelve mysterious alien spacecrafts touch down with unknown intentions. A special team is assembled by the US military, led by Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker), to attempt to communicate with the aliens. The team enlists the help of expert linguist Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to help translate the alien language to figure out if they are here for peaceful reasons or to declare war on humanity.<br/><br/>Featuring clever and intriguing themes about the nature of humanity and our place in the universe, Arrival is a thinking person's sci-fi film that delivers everything you'd expect and more. Director Denis Villeneuve's creative use of cinematography and long shots inside the alien spacecraft is very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I think he's a great choice to direct the upcoming Blade Runner 2049. Amy Adams gives an excellent performance in the role of Dr. Louise Banks. There was never a moment in the film where her character felt unbelievable or forced.

(Don't they have military linguists and communications experts for just this?)<br/><br/>Officer plays audio clip of indistinguishable alien audio and demands the professor tell them what it means on the spot, yet refuses to believe she would need more than a 10 second clip to decipher a new language. <br/><br/>Fast forward, the Earth starts peacefully communicating with these ships and actually start to learn the language. The countries that are always the bad guys in movies cut communications with the rest of the world and begin to turn hostile toward the aliens. <br/><br/>As the linguist literally learns the language and has peaceful communication, the Army decides the only option is to attack. They take up and detonate a single block of explosives inside the ship. That's apparently all the Army thought was necessary to destroy a 1500 ft. tall spaceship that defies the laws of physics. <br/><br/>The linguist is saved from the blast by the aliens. The aliens send a cab for her, and she goes back up. They tell her she's the chosen one and can see into the future. She saves the world by looking into the future and then telling a Chinese general what his wife's dying words were. She sees her whole life, and she unites all of humanity. <br/><br/>The injected love interest (who offers no valuable input aside from standing around) basically says, ""We discovered an entirely new species that shattered our interpretations of time-space, but you're the one I can't stop thinking about.""<br/><br/>What this movie taught me: 1) The Army in incapable of rational thought. 2) A pretty woman is enough to distract a physicist from the greatest scientific discovery of all mankind. 3) A liberal arts degree may actually be useful.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Not a terrible movie but FAR from 8.5/10."

","I watched Arrival on its first showing tonight here in the UK. I had been attracted by the buzz around the movie -- and I was not disappointed. I found it a challenging and absorbing piece of work, an intelligent speculation on the time-honoured sci-fi theme of what happens when 'they' finally land.<br/><br/>Linguistics expert Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is recruited to establish communication with the aliens, joined by mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They are driven out to Montana (played here by Quebec) where a huge alien craft, one of 12 to have arrived at various locations around the globe, hangs massively above the ground. Every 18 hours a portal opens in the base of the craft, allowing access within. <br/><br/>Two giant, squid-like 'heptapods' -- irreverently nicknamed Abbot and Costello by Donnelly -- can be glimpsed behind a large, translucent barrier. In an effective visual trick, the barrier is the same size and aspect ratio as a cinema screen, so you find yourself looking beyond the screen into a kind of cinematic second world -- a screen beyond the screen, in fact, where here be monsters. <br/><br/>The aliens communicate by forming mysterious, smoky glyphs that obviously mean something -- but what? Dr Banks is under pressure from the military, represented by Col Weber (Forest Whitaker) to determine the visitors' intentions. Gradually she assembles a vocabulary and begins to comprehend their language. Meanwhile international tensions grow as the superpowers race to read the aliens' mysterious messages, jockeying to gain military or scientific advantage over their rivals.<br/><br/>There are tensions, too, in the internal dialogue of the movie's main character, Dr Banks, played by Adams with a kind of steely, intelligent vulnerability -- an award-deserving performance that is never anything less than completely convincing. Dr Banks is troubled by visions of a daughter who died young. It is natural to assume that the daughter scenes are flashbacks -- but beware of assumptions. The narrative plays with time. Renner's wise-cracking, caring, crumpled support strikes exactly the right note. <br/><br/>Bradford Young's cinematography is muted, the story played out under lowering grey skies and within the dark confines of the alien craft, while director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) keeps the pace moderate but relentless. The film is a builder without a wasted shot. The dialogue is spare verging on staccato, wasting no words on excessive exposition, the writing credits going to Eric Heisserer (screenplay) and Ted Chiang, who wrote the original story. Johann Johannsson's score is consistently compelling and occasionally sublime.<br/><br/>Arrival demands close attention. This is no dizzying CGI-fest of space cadets saving the world. The mood is serious, the theme grown- up, the narrative cerebral. Humanity is held up against the mirror of an overwhelming -- and manifestly technologically superior -- alien presence. Villeneuve treats his genre and his audience with respect. His film deserves the same."
"HollywoodGlee","9","9","22","10 October 2016"," Arrival is a science fiction thriller dealing with human survival on the brink.
","Viewed by Larry Gleeson during the Venice Film Festival.<br/><br/>Canadian Director Denis Villenueve's (Sicario, Prisoners, Incendies) new science fiction drama, Arrival, is based on Ted Chiang's ""Story of Your Life."" Alien ships have landed across the globe without explanation communicating only a Sanskrit word for war.<br/><br/>The film opens in a reflective voice-over coupled with powerful sound effects and strong camera work to create a feeling of pandemonium. Supersonic jets blaze across the screen as 12 unidentified flying objects descend from the sky and land across the globe. The aliens attempt to communicate with written words and phrases in a never seen before language. Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist played by Amy Adams (Man of Steel, American Hustle, The Fighter), is charged with communicating with the alien intelligence. Artist Martine Bertrand designed the aliens written language. The Sanskrit word for war is delivered to Louise at her university teaching office for translation. At first she balks. However, the opportunity to put to use all she has learned in a lifetime of study and academia and the mourning she's gone through over the loss of her daughter provides her the impetus to join the effort.<br/><br/>Initially, Dr. Banks appears anxious. However, she quickly is brought up to speed by the US military. Captain Marks, played by Mark O'Brien, informs the team on what is known about the alien landings. One of the first translations the group deciphers is ""language is weapon."" Soon however, the process is stalled. Intelligence about the alien space ship reveals that their doors open every 18 hours granting an opportunity to board the craft. After dialogue and heated conversation, Dr. Banks is granted clearance to board the craft with the team. With the team in position to board the craft, Villenueve amps up the sound effects and music including some very heaving breathing from Dr. Banks as the team waits, attired in Cybex hazmat suits, for the alien ship to position itself to allow boarding. With the ship's entry encapsulated in smoke combined with some abstract visuals and the surreal effect of slow motion the team boards the alien vessel.<br/><br/>In the end, Dr. Banks proves she's up for the task and begins the communication process with the aliens but not without difficulty. An interesting reference is made to the Sapir-Whorf theory that once a person starts to learn a language the person will start to dream and think in it. However, when the aliens begin writing a thought one hand begins the thought while the other hand ends it simultaneously. Louise's mind has difficulty comprehending this and she begins to experience highly vivid, visual flashbacks of her daughter. She begins to wonder why. Once the team members managed to board the ship and attempted to understand and communicate with the aliens they were enlightened with insight into their own human nature. In the end this appears to help Louise move on with her life finding closure to the cancer that took her daughter's life.<br/><br/>Seemingly, a large part of the film's aesthetics is augmented and carried out by sounds. Dave Whitehead created the whirrs and clicks of the alien language while Supervising Sound Editor Sylvain Bellemare created the sounds the ships made when moving. Composer Johann Johannsson created the film's musical score.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, The Bourne Legacy, American Hustle) plays Ian Donnelly, a physicist who attempts to solve the alien communication through mathematics. And is the sidekick to Adams Louise. Donnelly comes across as highly intelligent, energetic scientist who adds warmth and light to the team's dynamic. Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland, Lee Daniels' The Butler) plays Colonel Weber, Military Intelligence, who's responsible for coordinating the communication process. Weber needs Louise and Ian to succeed and it's his job to see that they do. Weber pushes the two to do more and to get more from the aliens. Michael Stuhlbarg (Boardwalk Empire, Men in Black III) plays CIA Agent Halpern who's responsible for reporting to the government the team's actions.<br/><br/>Arrival is a well-constructed film with a stellar cast and talented crew. Notably, Amy Adams is superb as Dr. Louise Banks. The costuming provided by Costume Designer Renee April and the production design provided by Patrice Vermette were excellent as were Carlos Huante's alien visual effects. In addition, the sound design and musical score brilliantly augmented and sophisticatedly created the atmospheric for the film's mis-en-scene. Executive producer and screenwriter Eric Heisserer adapted the short story to screenplay. 21 Laps and Film Nation received production company credits along with producers Shawn Levy, Dan Cohen, Dan Levine, and Aaron Ryder. Bradford Young served as Cinematographer capturing delicate moments with sensuality along with the massive ""rainy day"" science fiction scenes.<br/><br/>Arrival is one of the year's most important films about life and death and the reality between the two. It also speaks volumes on humility within the parameters high stakes, foreign communication . Highly recommended."

","Great concept, but a complete butcher job in terms of execution. <br/><br/>This film is bland with some interesting ideas laid out between more boring drivel. The aliens have a unique way of communicating which is barely enough to keep one interested. Thirty minutes in I was not remotely engaged.

Even the climax moment falls flat. <br/><br/>Amy Adams is unbelievably dull and I find it hard that her character could draw a circle let alone interpret them. For most of the film her heavy breathing and deadpan delivery are nearly unwatchable. Jeremy Renner adds more of the same. These two have the chemistry of cement drying.<br/><br/>The only redeeming factors in the film? The linguistic differences between the human and alien mind. This along with the alien understanding of time and how it relates to the climax of the film are intriguing. Too bad the characters and writing suck. <br/><br/>Everything about this film was done poorly. It will leave you feeling nothing--unemotional.

","Despite the almost universal appreciation of Arrival as a smart and thought-provoking sci-fi film, actual scientists and hardcore nerds will find it clumsy and lightweight. The plot seems deliberately unscientific, from the non-taxonomic name given by scientists to the aliens, to the lack of biologists in any of the assigned teams (!!!), it becomes clear that the writers put science to one side, and concentrated on the fiction, rehashing first-contact plots from great films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Signs, The Abyss and Contact (they are all shamelessly plundered in Arrival!) <br/><br/>Adams' turn as linguist Dr. Banks is up to her typically high standard, but against the improbable and sanguine plot, her character flounders. The concept that she alone, among hundreds of scientists, could initiate communication just by her skills as a linguist is farcical. All other scientists are portrayed as clueless, terrified idiots. Renner, as a theoretical scientist of an undisclosed and apparently useless field provides some much needed mirth, but his character contributes nothing to the plot save some future DNA. <br/><br/>But Arrival really falls apart for sci-fi fans as soon as it is revealed that the aliens experience non-linear time, and pass the technique of doing so on to Dr. Banks. At this juncture an inquiring mind should consider the magnitude of the concept of a creature that can exist in non-linear time - they are essentially omniscient and immortal, being able to access any point in their lifetime at will. They can also change their past and future, essentially being able to create parallel universes at will. Banks proves that this is the case by accessing information from General Chang's wife, suggesting that Banks can access her past and change it (she previously did not have the info on Chang's wife's dying words, at least not in the linear time-going-forward presentation of the movie). With the power of time travel and multiverse-hopping at her fingertips, surely Banks would teach the technique to her future daughter, allowing her to never have to access the part of their lives where she dies of cancer and Banks' life falls apart. Why would Banks persist in re-living her tragic future instead of changing her past and living a parallel life in a parallel universe? Sentimentality over her daughter would likely become less significant once Banks had simultaneously lived a billion different lives with a billion different daughters in parallel universes. Perhaps that dehumanization would have been a good subject to focus on - we might see Banks allowed to change her tragic future, but deciding to keep it. But that didn't happen in this film. <br/><br/>Banks would also have had these abilities for her whole life, not just from the moment (in linear time) that the aliens arrive. Thus she would have been aware of their language and writing without all that torturous study and work. The aliens, whatever their agenda in visiting Earth in the 21st Century, would also have known that Banks would be their contact, so why send eleven other ships across the globe, terrifying the planet and risking war? And why did it take so long for them to start 'writing' and communicating with the US team? The potential sci-fi generated from the concept of non-linear time is genuinely mind-blowing, and is not even touched-on in Arrival. The movie relies on the emotional subplot of Banks' 'future' memories and undisclosed 'future' relationship with Donnelly (Renner) - but the alien visit and subsequent time-skipping-ability don't provide a very interesting counterpoint to this. <br/><br/>Essentially this is a story about a woman dealing with the tragic death of her daughter... oh yeah, then some aliens help her to save the world from the Chinese. Look back to the movie 'Signs' - similar concept, a family struggling to come to terms with the death of the mother amid an alien invasion. In Signs, the invasion scenario drives the plot forward, allowing the characters to develop and an interesting story arc to grow. In Arrival the contact scenario nearly starts and then stops a war, but has little impact on the characters other than the omniscience thing, which is rather wasted on visual rhymes and whimsical sentimentality. Arrival is vapid sci-fi, and there's a place for that in cinema, but when the plot (and marketing) of a film hangs on the science of linguistics, concepts of time and existence and is delivered with full-force tepid brown- graded realism - that science better be excellent. In my view, the Jurassic Park homage during the helicopter scene was a disservice to a film with a superior vapid sci-fi concept."

","Could it be that the less sense a movie makes, the better it's ranking here on IMDb? As I write this, the film is #93 on IMDb's Top #250. I've already ranted enough in other reviews to explain my position on this regarding new releases, so I won't bore you with it here. My main problem with the picture is that there doesn't seem to be an inherent logic to the story line. Linguist Louise Brooks (Amy Adams) makes significant inroads into understanding an alien language configured in Rorschach-like circles, and as the viewer, we're never really privy to how she managed to do it. The non-linear time element introduced into the story is quite bewildering as well, highlighted by Adams' character placing a phone call to a Chinese general AFTER he showed her his phone number, some time in the FUTURE! There are going to be those who hail this movie as brilliant film making, but I have to tell you, if I have to have it explained to me, then it doesn't pass a basic test for telling a good story. Namely a picture with a solid beginning, middle and end."

"jmyersgoucheredu","10","8","19","19 November 2016"," Superb Sci-Fi Metadrama
","In American education, there has been much emphasis lately on the so-called STEM topics at the expense of the Humanities. We emphasize career-oriented education and neglect education that emphasizes human relationships. *Arrival* is a movie that consciously tries, if not to reverse the power relationship between Science and the Humanities, at least to show the fundamental importance of the latter through contemplating what it sees as the basic tool in human relationships--language. <br/><br/>Of course, Science Fiction is the perfect genre for such an endeavor because its very name is a combination of the Sciences and the Humanities. If we posit that the strength of the Sciences is their predictive value (for example, repeated experiments lead to technology that can predict that an airplane will fly under certain physical conditions), *Arrival* shows that the Humanities have a predictive power of their own that has to do with relationships. The Fiction part of Science Fiction can predict, in a less formal and less easily understood way than Science predicts things, how relationships will function. <br/><br/>Specifically, the film's protagonist, Louise Banks, a professor of linguistics played very sensitively by Amy Adams, uses her skill in language to chart a course through the complexities of relationships on all the levels a human might experience, from confronting the absolute other of an alien species to political relationships between different countries to her own relationship with her scientist husband and the daughter they create. In doing so, Louise becomes a metadramatic surrogate (metadrama is drama that reflects on itself as drama-- think Shakespeare's ""All the world's a stage) for the creator of *Arrival* itself and a champion for the mysterious predictive power of Fiction in general. <br/><br/>It does all of the above, as it must do to be effective, in a humanly compelling story conveyed through wonderful performances. That is what makes *Arrival* a great movie!"

"sossevarvo","9","7","16","7 November 2016"," Finally- a science fiction film that assumes its audience is intelligent.
","Denis Villeneuve is a masterful filmmaker who consistently elevates genre pieces, as seen with Sicario and Prisoners, to awe-inspiring heights. Arrival, his first take on the science fiction field, is no exception. <br/><br/>The film is perhaps the most realistic, measured tale of alien invasion yet made. Here is a movie that deals with extraterrestrial contact with probing questions of linguistics and science, rather than displays of violence, sound and fury. Our hero is not a six-pack laden, gun-wielding brusque, but a college lecturer. It is difficult to discuss the movie in depth without spoilers, but the most striking aspect is how impeccably and intricately well-crafted it is. By the end of the film. upon reflection, I staggered out of the cinema marvelling at the sheer craft of the plot, which weaves mammoth intellectual concepts, questions about humanity, human experience, and, in particular, the story of one woman, Amy Adams. The film's plotting works so well as a whole that it's staggering, and this is to a great extent indebted to the editing, which I believe deserves an Academy Award. In a feat only possible in the medium of cinema, the scope of this heady tale is brought alive by complex editing, leading to a rousing finale that is emotionally cathartic. Also of note is the eerie score, truly contributing a sense of necessary awe and perturbation, as well as production design and effects, which are used perfectly to contribute necessary spectacle, but never threaten to usurp the plot itself. <br/><br/>It is because the positives of this film are so great that the negatives don't irk me so much. The weakest aspect of the film, fortunately alleviated by the strength of performances from Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, is a lack of character development. It's less that I sympathised with these characters and was involved with them particularly, and more that the plot remained so intriguing I was consistently engaged. In the fashion of the similarly cerebral Interstellar, whose Cooper-Murph relationship buttressed its science fiction plot, more character development could've made this excellent film perfect. In addition, there is an unexpected, incredibly corny line towards the end that really annoyed me. <br/><br/>Overall, Arrival was an immensely satisfying and rewarding cinematic experience, I anticipate the movie will have some detractors, possibly because of its lack of action that populates most science fiction films, and a plot that demands your constant attention, but for me it was a thrilling exercise in realistic, grounded sci fi."

"jamesaclark-49663","9","3","5","22 September 2018"," The Conundrum of Epistemic Arrival
","Everybody dies, right? Near the midway point of Denis Villeneuve's Arrival, physicist Ian Donnelly quips this thought to colleague Louise Banks amidst the smoky, enigmatic chamber of their alien subjects. Little does he know this very idea will come back to influence the remaining course of his life.<br/><br/>Arrival touches on a great many topics of intellectual and philosophical interest, including language acquisition, parenthood, mortality, political communication, and freedom of will. Centered around the work of two individuals to decode the purpose and mechanism of alien lifeforms, their results are more than applicable to life here on Earth. Although a touch too overt in some of the expository elements of the film, as seen when Dr. Banks wastes 30 seconds explaining the function of a whiteboard, or through strained, cheesy dialogue between Ian, Louise, and Colonel Weber throughout, the content subject matter itself captivates the audience with enough subplots to retain a wide audience.<br/><br/>Symbolically, the descent of the heptapods and the looming presence of their ship serves to constantly remind our characters of inevitable death. The heptapods resemble claw-like creatures and live in a misty, white environment, poised to snatch up the mortal humans into their purgatorial atmosphere. In a sequence of cuts between Hannah's death and Louise's experience of them in the audience's frame of temporality, Louise is depicted literally looking over her shoulder at the looming ship, representative of humans' near constant anxiety about the pervasiveness of mortality.<br/><br/>In a brief exchange between the two protagonists, the Sapir-Whorf theory of linguistic relativism, which lays the basis for the entire conclusion, is introduced forwardly. In this theory, the weak hypothesis claims that language categories influence thoughts and behavior; the strong hypothesis posits that language determine and limit cognitive categories. Such a distinction effectively compliments Louise's internal conflict to ""embrace"" a future that she has already experienced. When she asks Ian about the decision to influence the events of the ""future"", namely Hannah's death and their eventual marriage (to which he is completely oblivious), she fails to consider whether she even has agency to do so, as she has already experienced them in a non-linear timeline. The ""gift"" is not only an ability to predict events like Laplace's Demon, but rather to experience them simultaneously; otherwise, she would've been unable to leverage knowledge from her conversation with Shang in the ""future"" timeline.<br/><br/>While her attitude has ties to Camus' Sisyphus, Martin Heidegger's concept of being-toward-death is encapsulated coherently. Heidegger spoke of a unity between all three time states of time: past, present, and future. To find a true joy and freedom, he proposes a non-linear, non-traditional view of time in regard to our mortality; to live in light of our death. Villeneuve himself commented on the film's meaning to him in an interview with The Verge: <br/><br/>""I know I'm going to die. I have three kids. What can happen right now? I need to trust life, I need to embrace life...That's the way I see it, personally. For me, the movie was about a woman having a new relationship with death and changing her perspective on her own life.""<br/><br/>Despite limited flaws in chemistry between principal characters, a lack of dynamic development of Ian or Louise, and unnecessary plot addition of a political standoff, Arrival addresses areas of scholarly interest through a accessible, heart-wrenching, blockbuster lens, inviting intellectuals and laypeople alike to spend near two hours in a world of atemporal possibilities."

Instead we are presented with a well-crafted movie that has an intellectual heroine who can actually think her way through a problem.

","My wife and I were looking through Amazon Prime and said, hey, we didn't see that one at the theater, let's watch it now.<br/><br/>Two hours later, my wife said, ""Well, if I'd been watching that one at the theater, I would have gotten up half way through and asked for my money back.""<br/><br/>First off, let's look at the plot premise: In 3,000 years, humanity will help the Heptapods. But only if the Heptapods show up now to teach humanity their language, which being circular, shows that there is no such thing as actual free will, everything is predestined. That's one of the major issues with ANY time travel, as it can introduce a paradox. In this case, how is it that the Heptapods were able to be helped by humanity in the first place if they hadn't come back to change things?<br/><br/>Second, we have the whole Slaughterhouse Five connection. My wife thought that Dr. Banks (played by Amy Adams) was reliving memories until nearly the end of the movie. I had already made the connection that she was actually becoming unstuck in time similar to Billy Pilgrim.<br/><br/>Third, I've since then seen many reviews on here about how wonderful the music was. Seriously? The minor detail that during the scene in the Heptapod ship when Amy goes back in and a Heptapod comes 'swimming' by sounded like the theme from Jaws made both of us laugh a little.<br/><br/>Fourth, even my wife saw the flaw in the plan of only having ONE translator and ONE scientist on the team. She made the comment early on - 'Come on, they had a whole team studying the aliens in 'Transformers'. You're going to depend upon only ONE person? That, of course, was the fatal flaw here. Supposedly Amy Adams was the only person who still had her security clearance. How about all those people that actually already WORK for the U.S. Military, doing linguistic work?<br/><br/>Fifth (and of course, the quite ridiculous one) is that if you're going to show the military of other countries, it might help if you at least show them? Instead of simply taking US military vehicles and superimposing Chinese characters on their sides? Well, that, and let's face it - they showed the ship supposedly sitting out in the middle of nowhere in Montana. And suddenly when it came time for the armor to move in, they came screaming out of nowhere, over the hill! Seriously? You've got to figure that within a week at most, that sight would have looked like a scene from the original 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' or 'The War of the Worlds', with armor and artillery surrounding the site.<br/><br/>Sixth - and probably about the only thing that the movie got right - was the reaction of the public as mentioned on the news. There'd be some radio wackos talking about invasion - apparently they saw 'Independence Day'. There'd be some religious people killing themselves. And there'd no doubt be some serious reactions. But at the same time ... this movie presumes that no one in the world has ever watched or read a book about an alien presence on this planet, whether it's 'Starman', CE3K, ET, or any of the OTHER movies I've mentioned previously.<br/><br/>All in all ... can I ask Amazon for a refund of my Prime membership fee since I ended up watching this?"

In the case of Arrival, I tried, but it was very quickly very painful. I felt that I would be putting myself through a HUGE waste of time if I watched the entire movie without skipping.

","After I finished watching this, it took a little while to realize how conflicted I felt.<br/><br/>The movie held my attention, even though there was much more slow motion than there needed to be, and certain sequences were really dragged out much more than needed.<br/><br/>The central premise, once you look past the aliens and the peculiar visual elements, is that how we perceive language is fundamental to our understanding of existence.<br/><br/>The elimination of time seems to be a problem, and it allows us to understand that the flashbacks we are presented with are actually glimpses of the future. This is pretty clever, but it doesn't stand up to scrutiny. If that's the case, why does she see the future at the beginning before she learns to ""time travel?"" The argument could be made that her learning it later explains this. However, in that case, why is the rest of the story told in linear time? Even more troubling is the value of the circular time approach. If you can perceive all of your life simultaneously, there are no surprises. It raises a problem of free will not existing. It's a remarkably bleak existence, and the movie treats is as though this is some sort of step forward for mankind.<br/><br/>I actually feel like this is vaguely Lovecraftian - mankind being given knowledge that we shouldn't have that ruins our lives."
"ryandannar","10","8","20","12 November 2016"," A smart sci-fi film which couldn't be more relevant or timely:
","As a fan of science-fiction, I'm routinely disappointed in the intelligence and scope of the average sci-fi film. The last few years have been a boon, with intelligent films like ""Moon,"" ""Gravity,"" ""Her,"" ""Ex Machina,"" and ""The Martian"" receiving wide release. These films use the tools of science-fiction to mine introspective and philosophical themes, to allegorically say something about human nature.<br/><br/>And so it is with ""Arrival."" And yet, even though my expectations were set reasonably high by the trailer, I still found myself shocked by just how deeply interesting, powerful and moving this film was. In my mind, this film immediately joined the ranks of such all-time science-fiction film classics as ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""<br/><br/>The plot involves Amy Adams as a linguist, and Jeremy Renner as a scientist, both contracted by the military to try to establish meaningful communications with an alien race who have mysteriously appeared, hovering in an egg-like ship, somewhere in the majestic back-country of Montana. The ship is one of 12 which have appeared worldwide -- and so the race is on, as the US and its allies vie to crack the linguistic code before China or Russia. Fears that the aliens might prove malicious hang, omnipresent, over every move.<br/><br/>This could certainly be the plot of a fun, lightweight genre piece. But ""Arrival"" takes a more considered, more meditative approach. Rather than dispense with its heavy themes lightly, it examines them curiously, finds them more interesting the deeper it looks, builds its entire story around them. This is a film which rewards thought. The pacing of the film, which is very deliberate but not what I'd call slow, might owe something to Andrei Tarkovsky, the famous Russian director ""Stalker"" and ""Solaris,"" two of the slowest but most hypnotic and profound science-fiction films you're ever likely to see. Come to think of it, many of the sets in ""Arrival,"" as well as the camera- placement and lighting, reminded me of Tarkovsky's work.<br/><br/>No review of ""Arrival"" could be complete without mentioning something about the film's surprising third-act. This is likely to go down in cinematic history as one of the best ""mindblowing"" third-acts ever made. I felt a rush comparable to what I felt the moment I first learned the secret of ""The Matrix"" -- and yet, here, the ""twist"" is so poetic, so natural, so obvious in retrospect, that it really stands alone as a thing of greatness. It's a big thought, presented elegantly. But make no mistake -- the greatness of the ending is well-earned by the film preceding it.<br/><br/>I have to say that this movie did a number on me. There's this thing that happens when I see a movie that actually respects my intelligence, where I become moved by even the smallest directorial decisions, because they feel so right. <br/><br/>""Arrival"" drew me in almost immediately, with its intimate and ultra-realistic depiction of how Amy Adams' linguist, Dr. Louise Banks, learns of the arrival of the ships. She actually gets the news kind of late. It finds her in the middle of a class she's teaching, as several students' phones start chiming with texts. She's asked by one of her students to turn on the classroom TV. After she does, they all just sit there, stunned, watching the news- footage, not knowing how to react. An alarm goes off, the building is cleared, and everyone is sent home. These scenes play out with crystalline logic; the film observes them closely, without comment or bogus emotional cues. A meditative, nervous score percolates beneath.<br/><br/>And here I've described the feeling and the texture of this film, and given you many reasons to see it -- but I haven't even begun to tell you what it's about. Well, doing so would take a lengthy conversation; this film contains some very big ideas.<br/><br/>But more than anything else, this is a film about the power of language. A popular scientific theory, discussed by the characters in ""Arrival"" but dating back to at least George Orwell's ""1984"" and its concern with ""NewSpeak,"" holds that language actually shapes thought, and not the other way around. Vocabulary and syntax: We're introduced to these concepts before we even know what they are; from our earliest days we're taught the linguistic labels for things, for actions, for emotions and desires -- and we're taught to connect these words in specific ways, in patterns which convey specific meanings. The form of a question differs from the form of a statement. We just learn these things, most of us, and it gives shape to the way we think. Language and thought: Irrevocably intertwined. <br/><br/>To what degree is our perception of the world based entirely upon the language we use to describe it and interact with it?<br/><br/>That is what ""The Arrival"" is about, at its deepest level. It's also about a lot more. It's about a woman coming to terms with grief; it's about a world poised on the brink of war; it's about the fears which divide us; and it's about the bravery -- the trust and the risk -- that it takes to come together again. It's about the miracle of empathy. Arriving hot on the heels of a very polarizing election, when anxieties and animosity are high, this film's messages couldn't be more relevant or timely."

","Denis Villeneuve continues to show his skill and virtuosity with another film far removed from his last, and somehow tops that incredible movie with Arrival, which shares some similarities with his film Enemy, in that, you need to think.<br/><br/>If you want to sit back with your popcorn, don't watch this. If you want to see a film examine many aspects of humanity, such as language, memory, trust This is a film that challenges the assumed norms of how we relate amongst ourselves, and more importantly, how those relations could be tested by an alien visitor, which most of humanity seems to see as a threat. And that is human nature, to be afraid of that of which we do not know.<br/><br/>Arrival challenges this notion of being afraid of the unknown, and while doing so it delivers an incredibly thought-provoking story that I need at least two more viewings to piece together.<br/><br/>The monolithic alien crafts are an important character of their own - their size dominates many incredible outside takes and represent just how big the humans' task is - that is, to translate what these aliens are trying to say.<br/><br/>To go further into the story would be just mean, so go into this as blind as you can, with an open mind, and prepare for an experience.<br/><br/>This makes other recent films of the genre (with the exception of Ex Machina) seem downright pathetic and dumb. This is what sci-fi should be like - apart from the ending (arguably), this film does NOT show its hand to the viewer. This is easily one of the best movies to involve aliens too - the contact between humanity and their visitors is infinitely interesting. Credit must go Jóhann Jóhannsson and the sound-editing crew for creating the such a tense atmosphere when needed.<br/><br/>The way the aliens talk needs to be heard through cinema speakers, as it almost sends chills up your spine. Soon though we become accustomed to it, much like the scientists down on Earth who are trying to decode what these beings want, using all the mathematic, scientific and linguistic skills in the world. The soundtrack is also a fantastic feature - it is never over-bearing, but is incredibly strong when it needs to be, and it all sounds suitably alien.<br/><br/>The film needs to be seen on a big screen. Not only does the alien craft look amazing, but it is also a part of some incredible camera-work. There aren't enough scenes outdoors to take advantage of this on a large scale, but boy, when we do see the ship, it is a sight to behold. Not only the craft, but the amazing looking clouds surrounding it, indicating just how huge the ship is.<br/><br/>Amy Adams leads the way as a very convincing protagonist, the linguist who is lured in to somehow decode the messages. Her working partner is a scientist, a surprisingly okay Jeremy Renner. The contrast between these professions isn't explored as much as it could have been, but hey, given the massive themes this film is juggling with only two arms, I think I can let that one slide.<br/><br/>""The best sci-fi of the decade?""

The diplomacy and tentative contact between the aliens and the Adams/Renner combination of genii is the best thing in the film, and the best scenes all come when the pair are attempting to communicate, and decipher the aliens' own language.<br/><br/>The acting from these two, especially Adams, is superb, allowing for a real emotional connection and investment in the characters. Overall it's a solid effort from Denis Vileneuve, better than 'Prisoners' though not as good as 'Sicario'. It is perhaps not quite as good as some of the furore may suggest, and the final third loses some focus and credibility, but it is still one of the best and most intelligent sci-fis in recent years, and definitely worth watching. 82/100."

"Screen_Blitz","9","7","17","19 November 2016"," Thoughtful and visceral in nearly every sense, Arrival makes for a breathtaking experience
","Arrival is far from your average science-fiction thriller. From the cinematic brilliance of director Denis Villenueve who's proved himself as a stellar filmmaking talent in 'Enemy', 'Prisoners', and 'Sicario', comes an intelligent sci-fi piece that ditches the typical special-effects action extravagant tropes in favor for some thought-provoking conceptions and mesmerizing visual storytelling. His efforts all come down to a story of extraterrestrials paying Earth a visit, a typical concept that leads you to believe the world has an full-scale invasion on their hands. This film however, is not quick to jump on that train. Instead, we are granted with a more thoughtful and emotional story focused more on the curiosity of this shocking event than an epic explosion-heavy fight between the two different species many sci-fi fanatics are often accustomed to. So this film follows Dr. Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams), a linguist professor who arrives at her class when she hears the worldwide news of a dozen alien spacepods that have landed in different locations throughout the globe leading millions of people around the world spiraling in panic and China's military preparing for war. She is soon approached by Colonol Weber (played by Forest Whitaker) who enlists her to help communicate with the aliens. Tasked alongside Ian Donnelly (played by Jeremy Renner), her mission to communicate with the extraterrestrials becomes a search for answers of a question the whole world is asking: Why are they here?<br/><br/>Slipping in some credible influences to earlier science-fiction outings such as Steven Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind' and Robert Zemeckis's 'Contact', Denis Villenueve takes on a slightly more daunting task of mixing the sci-fi genre with solid realism and cerebral narrative heft to feed the audience into something more grounded and mind-bending than a string of explosive action-set pieces. The plot sets in within the first minutes when we are introduced to see strange looking alien ships descend around the world, and the media struggles trying make sense of this occurrence as countries everywhere are consumed in uncertainty and pondering on whether to remain calm or take military action. The real tension begins however, when Amy Adams is ascended into an alien ship to come face-to-face with their aliens via window. We watch as the grotesque-looking creatures express their language through use of circular patterns created by oozing some sort of ink on the window, and the mystery Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are investigating on these weird symbols mean in attempt to discover what their innovations are for presence on Earth. These scenes are equally breathtaking and smart to the point leaving viewers squirming with both curiosity and fear, while embracing the visual resonance that defines the film's beauty. As the story goes on and the fate of humanity rest of the characters' shoulders, Villenueve drives it on an emotional atmosphere that demands the viewers for questions and provokes fear not from what we know, but what we don't know. This all comes down to a revelation that is not destined to be impressive, but at least smart in some degree.<br/><br/>There is much more than the handy screenplay by Eric Heisserer that guides the film into a smart, mind-bending atmosphere, the film also boasts its visual beauty in the technical department. One of the major elements is the cinematography. Roger Deakins who flourished some dazzling cinematography in Denis Villenueve's previous outings 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' is sadly absent from this collaboration with Villenueve. Fortunately, his place substituted by Bradley Young who demonstrated some solid camera work in 'A Most Violent Year' and 'Selma', and his fine cinematography deliver some camera work that can falls nothing short of breathtaking. Capturing long lingering shots of the alien space pod floating above the ground, Young's cinematography grants use with an electrifying (and occasionally jarring) look at the atmosphere surrounding the space pod and the sight is incredibly beautiful to look at. Furthermore, it all feels very believable enough to where you can almost feel uncertainty of the characters as they approach the mysterious sightings. Lastly, one of the astounding aspects of the film is by far Amy Adams in the lead role. She delivers incredible humanity to the character to the point of not feeling like one, but a normal human being looking for answers. If you were dazzled by what we delivered in films like 'American Hustle' or 'The Master' Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker who step foot in the supporting are both very credible here as well, even though they don't veer to far in the spotlight as lead Amy Adams.<br/><br/>Arrival is thoughtful science-fiction piece that blesses viewers with one of the most visceral cinematic experiences of the year, and shows director Denis Villenueve on the road to the front ranks of American filmmakers. Though the slow pace is enough to frustrate some movie goers looking for something more exciting and less busy with high-classed ideas, there is no doubt that this makes for a remarkable experience."
"quinimdb","9","7","17","18 November 2016"," Arrival
","""Arrival"" is a very cerebral film, but that doesn't mean that the film isn't intense, or thoroughly interesting and entertaining. While there may not always be something exciting happening on screen, in the traditional sense, there is always something to think about in what you are being shown and told.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" begins with a shot of a ceiling, panning down to show an empty house with a glass wall, and the deep horizon beyond that. Next, it begins a montage of personal memories. Louise Banks has a daughter, her daughter becomes a teenager, she is distanced from Louise, she is diagnosed with cancer, Louise's daughter dies. Over top of this is a speech about the chronology of memories and how she doesn't yet understand how they work. This is a perfect introduction to the film. It shows interpersonal relationships and memories connected to all that beyond us which we can't yet understand.<br/><br/>When Louise first hears of the news of extraterrestrials, her first reaction is to continue every day life and her job as a linguist professor and expert, pretending as if nothing happened. Except empty, desolate shots of her walking through the building show us that no one shows up to her class. There is a sense that nothing truly matters to humans anymore. No one cares about classes, because they know there is so much beyond them, more advanced than them, that they couldn't possibly understand, and going to any class or job would now be pointless. They are reminded of their insignificance. Therefore, when Louise is given the chance to interact and understand these extraterrestrials (due to her cooperation with the government before), she goes for it. She could become significant.<br/><br/>From this point on, the film becomes incredibly tense throughout. The fantastic soundtrack lends to an element of mystery. Villenueve handles the first encounters with the aliens slowly and deliberately, revealing a little information at a time and showing just enough to pique our interest and give tension to the scene. The end result made the encounters with the aliens genuinely awe- inspiring. <br/><br/>However, even outside of the encounters there is always much to think about, and it's subtlety is the key to its success. It let's the audience the thinking about the ideas it presents. There is much shown about the various reactions to the aliens. Many gave up, seeing their arrival as evidence of their own insignificance in the universe, sending all moral codes and government established laws out the window. Some assumed that these aliens were a religious fulfillment, sent there by God for humanity. Some immediately assumed the worst of the aliens, taking an aggressive stance towards them and wanting to drive them away out of fear, and a desire to go back to normal life. All are wrong. Humanity is its own worst enemy. The correct response is to attempt to communicate with them and understand them. Louise levels with them as beings, and eventually she finds out we are just as important in the universe as these advanced beings, and one day may be even more advanced than them.<br/><br/>Ian Donnely, a man working with Louise, claims that science and math are the only ways to communicate with the aliens. Louise thinks it's language, and she's right. After all, what's to say these advanced aliens don't have a completely separate set of mathematical and scientific laws and principles? What they definitely have is language. It is the only way to communicate experiences, therefore learn more and advance further.<br/><br/>There is a theory stated in the film that the language you speak (or write) determines the way you think. Louise ultimately learns this through her experience.<br/><br/>The way she thinks is entirely changed. Memories extend out in both directions, seeing her future as well as her past. All time is depicted as a solid, unchangeable loop, but this Predestination isn't depicted as a bad thing. Louise is able to accept her place in the universe, and her future life ahead of her. Her life is shown as happening as it should rather than happening beyond her control.<br/><br/>As far reaching and mind-bending as these ideas are, there is always a focus on the personal lives and relationships of characters. Towards the beginning of the film, there is a larger sense of size and scale beyond ourselves, the framing often showing the characters as small and the spaceship and aliens as large in scope and size. Later in the film, however, the characters are often framed in the foreground, with the spaceship out of focus in the background, depicting their own lives as constantly their main focus rather than the bigger picture. No matter what, our personal experiences and relationships define us, no matter how advanced we become or how much more there is beyond us.<br/><br/>There are a lot of ideas to digest in this film, and, while the entire film is interesting and thought provoking, the end is pretty mind blowing. This is definitely my favorite film of the year so far, and maybe a 10/10, but I'd need a second watch."
"aaronlmadden","9","7","17","11 November 2016"," Science Fiction Masterpiece!
","Science Fiction started out as a thought provoking genre that explored mystery and possibility. Films were made to raise questions about the unknown... The audience was introduced to groundbreaking ideas. Over time, technology developed, and film-makers took advantage of that. We began to see fantastic looking, big-budget pictures that, while being a marvel to look at, lacked the intrigue and mystery that used to be so rich in Sci-fi. Sci-fi, for the most part, became dependent on flashy imagery as opposed to master story telling. <br/><br/>Some films rose above this trend, and recently we have been given some great Sci-fi films. However, Arrival surpasses these and goes down as one of the greatest Science fiction films of all time. <br/><br/>We are given a simple premise that we have seen in movies before. Alien space crafts land on earth and strike fear among the human race. As the film progresses, the story unravels slowly... and transitions into mind-bending, unconventional territory. It goes in a completely new direction that is eye-opening and moving. There are important themes and ideas exposed to us that grab our interest and do not let go. The story is beautifully complex, and challenges its audience to think. <br/><br/>Visually, this film is breathtaking. The direction by Denise Vilineuve takes viewers to a new level of experiencing a film. Gorgeous cinematography and camera-work that is sometimes intimate, sometimes grand, and often unconventional, adding an experience that is both hauntingly surreal and authentic. The visual effects are almost perfectly executed, blending into the films dark, raw style. <br/><br/>The script, equipped with realistic dialogue and deep character development, makes this film stand out. The characters interact with subtle authenticity that feels natural. However, the strongest point of the film is Amy Adams. She embodies a character that is so vulnerable yet convincingly strong-willed. Her performance is all about subtle realism. She has perfected the art of living through a character as opposed to forcing the character out. The film rests on her and she carries it beautifully. All the other actors give convincing performances as well, delivering their dialogue and interacting with each other in such a natural way. <br/><br/>Arrival is a rare gem. It transcends beyond what an audience is used to experiencing. It is a film that cares about what it tells its viewers. It is a film with a purpose. Along with the classic and groundbreaking films of Kubric, Spielburg, Scott, and Lucas, Arrival is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made."
"RLTerry1","Null","7","17","11 November 2016"," You'll Want to See it Again!
","Prepare yourself for an extraordinary cinematic journey in this science-fiction thriller complete with commentary on the human condition. From the exhilarating cinematography to the incredible awe- inspiring visual effects, Arrival will have you hooked from the very beginning. Based on the book Story of Your Life and Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Sicario & Prisoners), Arrival boasts an outstanding cinematic experience that is as much cerebral as it is exhilarating. Your very perceptions of time and memory will be questioned and force you to open your mind to endless possibilities. Poignantly, this film takes you on a journey that will show you that we need to change and that we can change. On the verge of avant-garde, Arrival pushes the limits of traditional visual storytelling and creates an innovative method for conveying social commentary within the science- fiction genre. Following the final fade to black, you'll want to discuss this film with your friends. Reignite your sense of wonder. Arrival is more than a story; it's an experience!<br/><br/>After twelve egg-like unidentified objects land on earth, the U.S. Government calls upon expert linguist Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to crack the mystery and establish a means of communication with the homogenous alien species. While much of the world is on the brink of an all-out assault on the aliens, Banks is determined to develop a rapport and open communications with the species. Starting with basic words and working up to complex sentences, Banks knows she has to learn the alien's language in order to better understand why they have come. When things take a turn for the worst, Banks and Donnelly have precious little time to stop countries from engaging in battle with risk of war. With so little time to unravel the mystery of why the aliens are here and what they want, Banks will find herself on a mind-blowing journey of her own.<br/><br/>You've just got to see it. There is so much that i want to talk about but it would spoil so much of the film. I've mentioned before that there are great 'movies' that are mediocre 'films,' but this is a prime example of an excellent movie and brilliant film. The brilliance of this film is not in the stunning visuals, although that is certainly part of it; the brilliance lies within the cinematic and experiential storytelling. During the big reveal at the end of the film, your mind will be blown. You'll find yourself wanting to watch it again to more clearly understand the strategic placement of the pieces of the puzzle. During a time in which the country appears so incredibly fractured, this film will provide audiences with a renewed sense of wonder and appreciation for that which one may not fully understand. Making the tough calls and putting one's life at risk of what is right is also woven throughout this story. The theme of Arrival is not fully realized until the latter half of the film. More than a surface-level story about that which I cannot mention without giving it away, this film possesses a dynamic range of themes just beckoning for interpretation. As this film bares much similarity to avant-garde cinema in the reimagining of traditional storytelling, it will evoke a powerful emotional response. <br/><br/>Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner deliver outstanding performances in the lead roles. Taking center stage for most of the film, Adams breaks new ground as an actor in this role that is nearly a complete departure from most of her other roles. Both Adams and Renner display excellent chemistry in their respective characters. Although Adams is the central character and responsible for the drive of the plot, Renner is strategically placed to reinforce the affects Adams' character has upon the plot. Forest Whitaker also plays a strong colonel and was an excellent choice for his role as well. The success of the cast can be attributed to both the outstanding direction from Villeneuve and the incredible screenplay by Eric Heisserer. Bradford Young's cinematography is so simple but yet so beautiful and profound. It is of no surprise that this film is being touted as one of the best of the year and has a nearly unprecedented 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Whether you are a linguist yourself or just enjoy an exhilarating cinematic journey, Arrival is definitely the film to catch this weekend. If you enjoy movies that prompt you to revisit how you perceive your life, time, or space, then you will not be disappointed. There are so many levels to this film. You'll likely find yourself wanting to see it again after fully realizing the innovative plot. Hopefully this film receives some Oscar noms in the upcoming award season."
"MartinHafer","7","4","8","2 June 2019"," Good...but also very slow and NOT the sort of film that pleases the masses.
","When you look at the reviews for ""Arrival"" on IMDB, you might notice that there is a huge disparity among them. Many hate it, many love it...more so than most films. The reason, I think, is because this sci-fi film is very cerebral....and not a bit like ""Star Wars"" and more traditional science fiction.<br/><br/>In this story, 12 enormous space craft suddenly appear all over the world. Not surprisingly, folks are scared and people want answers. Soon, a representative from the military shows up and requests that Dr. Banks (Amy Adams) join with a team of researchers in the American west....as they want her with her impressive linguistic skills to try to communicate with the vessel and the creatures within...if there are any. What follows is a long, slow and mend-bending film...one that is interesting and appears very realistic...but also is cerebral.<br/><br/>The acting, special effects and all were very nice. I have no complaints about that at all. As for the story, I generally enjoyed it but felt that the whole concept of time being cyclical a bit strange....not bad, just odd. Overall, a good film but one that doubtless leaves many confused and bored."

The director needed to be replaced. I got the feeling that the actors had no idea what is going on.

"skoloman","2","4","8","8 October 2017"," Terrible, Borderline boring and Nonsense
","this movie was awful. it was nonsense and if just less happened it would be boring to death. though there were some good things about it. the premise was new and original, the cinematography was nice, acting was fine and *some* visuals like the alien ship were great. but the negatives outweigh the benefits. so why is this so bad? 1. nothing happens: the plot of this movie is so minimal and boring. all that happens is that aliens come to earth, Amy Adams talks to them, Chinese guy gets angry for no reason, aliens leave. and this is a 2 hour movie. as i said it's almost completely boring 2. unoriginal: this movie as i said has an amazing refreshing and original premise. there were possibilities to what directions this movie could go in. and the completely unoriginal filmmaker hacks decided to make the most boring and unoriginal thing of this. and the designs of the aliens are just as unoriginal. you could do so much with some creative designers... so the studio made sentient trees! (or squids whatever). 3. the twist: there are a number of confusing flashback sequences Amy Adams gets where she sees her dead daughter. the ,,twist'' is that it's actually her future daughter because she can see future thanks to the alien language... well that was unnecessary and dumb... 4. the characters: every character is completely dumb. even the ,,intelligent'' alien life forms are idiots. so first the army: they ask Amy Adams if she can translate some alien gibberish babble noises because she's good at languages. then they send a team of people into a ship of potentially hostile aliens just like that. the aliens are also dumb. if they can see the future and know that ,,some threat'' will threaten them and that earth will reject them why didn't they do something like defending themselves and not going to earth which they know will reject them? Amy Adams is also an idiot. after she gets flash-forwards of her daughter and knows she will die (yeah the daughter is just a bad plot device. not even like a source of character motivation or something) and she asks the alien: ,,who is that child?'' so not just is she dumb she has no common sense. also she knows her daughter will die in the future she still goes to hawkeye and basically tells him if he wants to f***. all the characters are not just dumb, they are completely bland and uninteresting. i don't even know their names. 5. it's too long: as i said before the premise is interesting but the movie is unoriginal and boring. but this movie could be much better if it at least was shorter. if this was a short film festival kind of a movie it would be a lot better. but the fact that it's 2 hours long makes it boring and unentertaining. 6. interstellar: there is a movie from i think 2014 it's called interstellar or something and well it's infinitely better than arrival. not comparing the plots but what Nolan has done with interstellar is the exact opposite of arrival. he took a very boring premise and made it interesting and entertaining while i genuinely felt emotion thanks to how good the story was. this movie took a good premise and made it boring. i felt literally no emotion even though the movie tried to force it on me with the violin music piece. ugh. Tl;Dr: arrival sucks, don't watch it"

"ehsubscriptions","4","4","8","5 June 2017"," Misleading
","It is wonderful to see a Sci-Fi movie that doesn't turn into a horror flick or war movie. The movie itself is intelligent, asks big questions, and focuses on the human experience, just like Sci-fi should. Unfortunately, none if this is entirely true.<br/><br/>The movie does fall short in its execution and the final payoff. If you are paying attention, I think that the viewer is left feeling cheated because the promise of the movie is never achieved and the story telling tricks that are used basically present a lie to the viewer for the majority of the movie. In the end, the lie is revealed but instead of being a lie coming from an unreliable narrator like in The Sixth Sense, it is a lie generated by the writer and director to provide a sense of conflict for the main character that does not really exist. This is the lie that ruins the movie. And, the final message of the movie, what we are left with, is a horrible vision of the universe with no uplifting or redeeming qualities except, maybe, that life has value.<br/><br/>The rest is spoiler so stop here if you have not seen the movie.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the protagonist being shown losing her daughter to some horrible disease. The protagonist is sad. She's obviously just gong through the motions after that. The cinematography and presentation also lends to this feeling of loss and desolation that the protagonist is obviously feeling. But, that's just a trick. The protagonist has not yet had the child and the child has not died yet. The producers show you these scenes from the future and then do not give any indication whatsoever that they have now moved the timeline back to present day -- the day the aliens arrive.<br/><br/>All through the rest of the movie, you see the protagonist trying to decipher the alien's language. You see her struggle to stay focused. You sense her deep despair over the loss of her child. They hint that the dad is a scientist and coincidentally she is working with a physicist during all of this. As a side note, Jeramy Renner's character of the physicist is pretty much useless during the entirety of the movie. He's only important to fulfill the future need for a dad for the kid that dies. You are fooled by this because of the lie setup in the first part of the movie.<br/><br/>Once the protagonist figures out the language, she can then see the entirety of time because that's what the language teaches you. Now the writer and director reveal that she has yet to have the child with the physicist father and she chooses to have the child anyway knowing that the child will die of a horrible disease. This is beautiful in that it shows the value of life and the power that it contains. It also indicates, as does other things in the movie, that the future is set and cannot be changed. This opens the door for all kinds of conflicts and philosophical discussions about the nature of the universe. None of this is explored, of course. It's just left sitting there like a pregnant hippopotamus. Then the movie ends.<br/><br/>The viewer is left unfulfilled. The great mystery of the aliens turns out that they want to give us the ""language"" which is earlier mistranslated as ""weapon"" which sets up a bunch of artificial conflict in the movie leading to one of the dumber scenes where a bomb is exploded on the space ship by mind-washed soldiers. But they provide this language where you can now see the totality of your existence through time. This means that it's pointless to live your life because you now know everything already. And, you know you cannot change anything at all. You will know that you are being a jerk to somebody who is going to die in the next hour, but you are still a jerk to them and you can do nothing to change it all. It is the ultimate expression of nihilism. Nothing you do matters. It's all set in stone even though you now may know better, you are doomed to live your mistakes all the way through. It would be like being trapped in a nightmare.<br/><br/>The language was not a gift. It was torture. It would destroy humanity. <br/><br/>So, in the end, it turns out that this was yet another horror flick disguised as sci-fi. The gift of the language really was a weapon. It wold destroy humanity by destroying the wonder of living your life."
"tiger86-2","4","4","8","2 June 2017"," Double U. Tee. Eff?
","This is one of the most baffling movies ever. Not because of the ""surprising"" twist, which is only surprising because it is completely moronic, but because it was so well received. Seriously, people, have we seen the same movie? Because 'Arrival' surely isn't a masterpiece. It is not a good movie, it is not even a mediocre movie. It is just bad. If I were to rate it solely on the basis of the pleasure I managed to extract from it, I would probably give it a rating below zero - which, sadly, I can't do on IMDb, but I would be very happy if I could. Of course, there are some good things about 'Arrival', which is why I am being so generous with the rating, but these good things only make the bad things stand out. OK, Amy Adams is one of the greatest film actresses ever. That is a fact, and here she is doing as well as the (idiotic) script allows her to. Jeremy Renner is also a great actor, and he just oozes charisma. The acting as a whole is pretty good. The cinematography is acceptable, I think. It is not spectacular, and it is definitely not Oscar worthy, but it is competently done, which is more than what I can say about the script. Before I rip the script to shreds, though, I just want to say that this movie does not deserve a single nomination for any award. It is not even interesting enough for a Razzie. And, I am sorry, but... An Oscar for sound editing? Against 'La La Land'? Seriously? What is next, praising Kevin Hart for being taller than Yao Ming? An Oscar nomination for production design? What for? I am sorry, but this movie literally does not have production design. What design? This space ship that looks like a giant bean? Or the dark rooms that look like dark rooms? Because there is literally - literally - nothing else. Literally. Did I say literally? From afar the space ship looks, as I said, like a giant bean. Shown from the inside, it looks like a dark room, and there are some boxes and one big rectangular window. That is it. That is the entire production design. Hell, reading about it here probably makes it look more inventive than it is.<br/><br/>As for the script... Well, it is exactly as good as it is expected from the writer behind the remake of 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. Seriously, Eric Heisserer's entire career consists of brainless horror/thriller movies and nothing else. Two remakes of beloved horror classics, one mediocre thriller that he also directed, one sequel that nobody wanted, and, well, 'Van Helsing', which will probably be the most enjoyable thing he has ever worked on, being a stupid high budget action movie. Oh, yes, I am forgetting 'Extinction' and the TV episode he did eleven years ago. Apart from 'Arrival', that is his entire career. Nobody expects from such a writer to write a masterpiece, and, unsurprisingly, he didn't write a masterpiece. Why was his work on 'Arrival' nominated for an Oscar then? Literally anyone can point out its flaws - be it the stupidity of the military men, making the military men in 'Transformers' look like Harvard professors in comparison, the fact that Jeremy Renner's character is not even a character, he is just there for the romance, the fact that the President of the USA never addresses the alien civilization visiting his country, the fact that not a single biologist appears on screen, the fact that the twist at the end is not only stupid, but it also limits the actors' performances in the most horrible way possible, the fact that the main character makes morally ambiguous decisions that may and probably will ruin the life of everyone she cares about for good and this is presented as something good... Notice that I am not actually spoiling the movie. If I were to do that, the review would be much longer.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is a complete failure, partially saved by the acting and the cinematography. But the cinematography is not that good and the acting is severely limited by the idiotic script. Sorry."
"arunpl","2","4","8","29 May 2017"," What a crap
","Humans are always curious. When 12 alien ships park in different regions of earth, the scope for the curiosity is endless. It emerges when we ask the most important question ourselves, 'What is the purpose of aliens on the earth?'. Yes, the movie to ask the question and everyone is hoping the lead actress to solve the question. <br/><br/>In order to solve this, first humans need to understand the method of communication between aliens. First part of the film is revolving around the interpretation of alien language. So naturally a linguistic expert Luise plays the important role. With her passion towards learning languages, she manages to find a way, visual communication. Interpretation part was some what okay. All subsequent events can be said as mindless crap. <br/><br/>What makes the second part of the movie a crap? It is the answer to the major question asked first. The purpose of the aliens is to gift humans a powerful weapon/tool. The tool is universal language and what it can be used for is to see the future. Why are they offering the tool? Because they need help from humanity after 3000 years. What help? Even director would not have thought about that. <br/><br/>So were humans able to see future? Yes, indeed, but only one. It is our linguistic expert Luise by taking a risk. She was able to see her married life with her future fellow scientist and also could see her future daughter. She was caught by some disease, and her grown up daughter sat near her death bed. Also there are hints that she mention about this disease to her husband and he leave her because of this. What a tragedy? If she was able to see the future, were she not able to see her husband leaving? She wrote a book about universal language. So with this book what did others do? Did they just play with stains and circles? What happened to world politics and religions? Was world at peace after understanding about future and also about aliens? They are conducting a party towards the end of the film with all world leaders. What happened in between? Do we need to write another movie and submit the script to the director of this movie? What holy words stopped Chinese general from attacking aliens? The aliens as per the movie are poor and kind creatures. One of them died after a bomb blast. With the powerful tool future visualization, why these creatures couldn't stop the death of their fellow members? Okay, leave it. Were they too weak or kind enough to not attack humans? Oh, may be they thought about help from human after 3000 years. What a mess? <br/><br/>There are endless questions to be answered in the movie which can be used for making another 10 or more movies like this. <br/><br/>And one of the funny thing I noticed is about mentions of Pakistan. As per one news report in the movie, the scientific experts from Pakistan helped the world to interpret the alien language. Holy crap !!! ;) Was director looking for a variety in the movie? May be he is right, expert scientists much like Osama Bin Laden can use their brain more efficiently to interpret the alien language.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this boring movie. This film is a lesson for futuristic directors, just adding a theme like foreseeing future does not make a movie good."

Of course, this is only my perception, the reader is welcome to disagree. SPOILER ALERT: The main protagonist is an unimportant Portuguese language professor, whose classes are attended by a handful of (mostly uninspired) students. She's single, lonely and without children. So she develops a fantasy in which she is a centerpiece figure in an major world-wide political and historical event, involving mysterious, Lovecraftian aliens, whose intentions and language are unknown to mankind. She uses her skills and expertise to save the world from impending doom and receives global acclaim. In the process, she meets the man of her dreams that helps her solve the final puzzle and they get a lovely daughter soon afterwards, bringing her fantasy to a happy end. SPOILER ENDS HERE.<br/><br/>What sets this film apart from your average shallow Hollywood industry product are stunning, dark-ish visuals and overall atmosphere. The only problem is that this type of ride has been offered by Lynch's masterpieces such as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive. Nevertheless, Hollywood has seriously lowered the standards by which any film is judged, therefore this one really stands out in the stale swamp of dysfunctional superheros with issues. Highly recommend watching in theater."

","I was very excited to see this film and in the end I was quite pleased, but kind of let down by how little action took place throughout the 2 hour run time. The movie is based on a linguist is hired to decipher an alien language to find out why there here. To those of you who still haven't seen the movie I would stop reading because then what will follow will spoil the entirety of the movie. Throughout the movie there are several hints of how the flashbacks shown in the beginning of the movie are actually things that would happen in the future after the aliens had already arrived. The sense of how time was not linear when reading the aliens language was quite confusing but really did make the film quite unique as a sci-fi. For me what stunned me were the amazing visual effects of the creepy-octopus-like aliens and also the space ships. What still amazes me after watching it is how the aliens ships dissipates in the clouds at the end of the film. What let me down though was the lack of action. Throughout the entire movie I was anticipating some action but in the end I was left kind of bored. From the trailer I did expect some action such as the explosion and the helicopters firing at the ship but in the end there was close to 0 action, so if you cant stand watching films without action I would not recommend. The only sort-of action within the 2h was an explosion, which lasted about 5 seconds.<br/><br/>Brief summary (for those who skim read)<br/><br/>+ The Idea behind time and how reading the aliens language makes a person perceive it as a non-linear variable.<br/><br/>+ The Visual effects are stunning and do satisfy Sci-Fi fans such as myself<br/><br/>+ flashbacks are heartfelt and bring together the pieces that left many baffled throughout the film.<br/><br/>+ well-acted<br/><br/><ul><li>Lack of action</li></ul>"

I hated the protagonists, I was bored by the aliens, and the entire plot is just unbelievably dull and pointless. Nothing happens, ever. Now, a few things do happen, but it takes the script ages to tell them, and there is absolutely no emotional payoff to any of it. It's a self-indulgent moody video that seems to last forever, and poses as a film. Just pure drivel. But the worst thing is that in the third act, the film somehow takes a turn for the worse. Even worse than what came before. I find it hard to believe anyone in the audience didn't ask himself: 'Why am I watching this crap?'

","I dare not voting below 3, there's way too much rubbish out there that can be substantially worse than Arrival, but, boy... what an overrated movie! I was anticipating since I heard about this film being released and went to see it on the first Saturday it was on screen. I virtually dragged my wife to it as she is not such a huge fan of SciFi, but I told her this one was different. Actually it was, it was one of the most boring (if not THE most boring) SciFi film I've ever seen. Pretentious to say the least, but it fails miserably and does not deliver neither action, nor real interesting arguments for a deep thought. About 90% of the screen time is covered by different awe/worry/nervous/anxious faces made by Amy Adams. Not saying she's bad, but you really need to be a monster to fill that much screen time only with your expressions. Jeremy Renner is there but could well not be; we're told he's a physicist, but he could as well be a butcher and nothing would change. Whitaker's first visit to Banks' office is just a joke (he plays a gurgling sound recorded from the aliens and asks her to translate it... just like that!). The rest of the movie is not any more meaningful.<br/><br/>2 h wasted. Luckily my wife did not run away..."

Weak imagery; fractured story; slow pacing and terrible editing make this one an elephant you don't want to ride.

I was waiting for one redeeming scene; line of dialog or story concept to come out of this movie just to throw it a bone and say ""it wasn't too bad"".....I got nothing.

"DunkelheitVZ","10","5","11","29 March 2017"," Not for everyone
","Let me start with: I hope that many, many SF fans love this movie so that we see mind blowing, thought provoking blockbusters like this more often. <br/><br/>But the movie is not for everyone. If you are not familiar with concepts of dimensions, if you cannot bear a movie without action, you won't be a happy consumer. If you appreciate movies for being unique, if you love slow movies which live and breathe with their atmosphere and characters and if you just like SF and science, you are going to love this one. <br/><br/>The next part contains heavy spoilers so don't read on if you have not seen the movie yet. The final reveal is mind blowing in its truest meaning of the word. So get ready, fasten your seat belt and watch this one. <br/><br/>I have read many one star reviews and they all boil down to: I hate the flashbacks, time moves too fast, things do not happen in a correct order. Well, this is the big catch of the movie. That time as we perceive it, is perceived in another way. Time is a concept that we have. In reality, it is a dimension. There are theories that everything is available at this very moment. But we perceive it in a flowing way, because we cannot grasp reality in another way. To understand this concept, let us look a level lower, at a 2D scenario. If there are creatures that live in 2D only, how would they perceive a 3D structure? Imagine they live in the page of a book. They could only understand a body as a flow of 1000 pages. Each page would look like one photo of a CT scan. And only all 1000 pages together would form a 3D structure. We perceive time the same way. Only our 1000 pages of a book are 1000 seconds or 1000 years. But it might very well be a possibility, that everything is present at all times, we just cannot grasp it that way. <br/><br/>In the movie, Louise starts to break this barrier. Time stops being represented by a flow, but Louise can see all events at the same time. She does not need 1000 CT scans to see a body, she can see it right away as a whole. This is the reason why she sees flashbacks of a daughter that does not even exist. Or why the question of having a baby seems to come so early in the relationship. Because there is no ""late"" or ""early"" or ""future"" or ""past"" for Louise any more. <br/><br/>And if you understand this, you can feel the beauty of this movie with full force. Even though there is so much pain for her, she still accepts the flow of time as we understand it. She still wants to have her daughter even though she knows that she will die early because of disease. And even though she knows that her husband will leave her, she accepts his love in the first place. Because it is not about the destination, it is about the journey.<br/><br/>I hope I could help a little to make you see this movie as I see it. A beautiful masterpiece that makes you a better person in the end."

","What do you get if you cross The Fountain with Independence Day? I hooted with laughter at both of those films at the time, but after seeing Arrival they suddenly appear stately and meaningful. And at least I didn't haven't to squint in the dimness of it all. The over-use of TV news and gasp TV news seen on laptops to tell the story in here grated with me, it always looks like a lazy script when they fall back on that old fashioned and hackneyed trick. Now add incredibly old fashioned and hackneyed art-house ""music"" comprising random burps farts and groans to this mix.<br/><br/>The plot appears as dim and grey as the film: 12 gargantuan alien stone peanuts float down on Earth causing consternation among all the ants in God's garden, turn into gargantuan mushroom caps and after the phoning to a Chinese general of his wife's dying words start gargantuanly fizzing away in mid-air - apparently job done. Er.<br/><br/>I'll try again. Expert linguist Amy Adams put in a good performance as usual, but what to make of her deathly serious demeanour for the entire film is the big question. She didn't even smile at Jeremy Renner playing a brainy physicist press-ganged into playing a spare tool. We're told that successful communication with the aliens could take years to accomplish and we can also guess there's years of boredom ahead, when Adams segues into a higher state of consciousness and finds out in seconds they want to help us now as they want something from humanity way in the future. Er.<br/><br/>As bonkers as The Fountain and as gungho as ID. The use of flashback memories brimming over with loss and longing to a heart tugging string quartet is the big similarity to the Fountain though, and it works fine again. If you're looking for lightheartedness you won't find it here, or a meaningful examination of the political motives of alien and Man either. Just another arty excuse to explore the overwhelming emotions we all have and can froth to, as we've all lost someone or something in our lives. Including these 116 linear minutes I knew I'd never get back before the film had even started."

","When I saw that Denis Villeneuve had made this science fiction film, I knew I had to see it. It's an intelligent, gripping movie about first contact with an alien species, specifically with our attempts to communicate with them. It turns out that communication with aliens may not be as easy as one would think! Especially when aliens do not have the same sense of time and language that we have. Learning an alien language would have a profound effect.<br/><br/>The story is told in such a way that the viewer is left to figure it out. The plot is non-chronological. I admit I had to visit the internet afterwards to understand better what I had just seen. Amy Adams pretty well carries the movie on her own, and she pulls it off. A great movie."

","I loved this movie. In the first five minutes it almost had me in tears, and not many movies ever succeeded in doing that. The pace is slow, but never too slow, it stays very interesting. Even though the big guy next to me fell asleep after devouring a popsicle, a bag of chips and a bottle of Fanta, I was never distracted from the story. The director pulled me in from the first second and the atmosphere he creates lasts throughout the movie. Great cinematography an soundscape as well. Amy Adams once again shows her great acting skills, and if you don't love Jeremy Renner after this movie, you never will. And in spite of one being part of the DC Universe and the other of the Marvel Universe, they have great chemistry together. <br/><br/>There is a lot more to be said about Arrival, but I just think you should go watch it yourself to make your own judgment.

"dautonn","8","5","11","30 November 2016"," More than scientists, professors, soldiers, we're all humans – and if there's something that makes us all different from other living things is that we feel.
","It's not just science fiction. I always say that fiction is created by those who see a better future, and because they imagine it, they create it. Imagination becomes reality. It happened before, it's like writing a draft for a possible play. ""Life imitates art"" it's been said. More than scientists, professors, soldiers, we're all humans – and if there's something that makes us different from other living things is that we feel. ""Arrival"" starts with this idea. When extraterrestrial beings arrive, Planet Earth and all within it – governments, ideologies, people – gets terrified. What's their purpose here? Coming back to reality a little bit, look what happens now in human history – we're still struggling with the same problems, and we have been facing it for many decades – war, hunger, poverty, materialism, degradation of environment, fossil-fuel-based – all of these need to be ""cured"" as we step into this new century. We're still learning, but the process of learning is very slow – you cannot see it easily, but from far away, in a bigger perspective. In the movie, that's why they came - they saw a glimpse of hope. Somewhere, there was greatness in us, we just needed a little push. Maybe we could return the favor one day. They arrive. Scientists and linguists try to understand strange beings with a complicate but beautiful language, this holds attention for a while and after some time gets tiring and scary, but understandable – they wanted to pass just a simple little message and that was it. No wars, no ultra super-advanced technology, no immortal life and gold. The plot plays with it, showing us the immense power of (miss) communication and interpretation and how it can affect this messy, hurry and impatient world we live in. Maybe because we're still considered a primitive species, we want quickly answers, if we don't have it, bad things happen - They will exterminate us, and what chances do we have? Comparing with a society that had discovered the interstellar travel, we would be just bacteria at their eyes. Even if they were born a few million years before us, they would be much more advanced than we are at this moment in history. So let's bomb them before they bomb us. I'm sure the viewer feels the impotence, that this scenario probably would happen in a real-like situation and you could do nothing to stop the coming apocalypse. But there's a way out: Some argue that any intelligent and violent civilization would destroy itself before getting to the stars. It's like a ""firewall"" rule for life across the universe. A test - If you don't get good grades, you're not going to pass. And if this rule is valid for us, certainly was valid for them. Any civilization must think itself as one. Union. And that's what ""arrival"" is all about. They understand us more than we understand ourselves. If you've seen your whole future life, would you change something? This question is asked by the protagonist - Amy Adams, nostalgic and beautiful as always - as she sees her future, a power maybe given by them, to see a possibility of her destiny, and all that would come with it: flowers, but also sorrow. This is deeper than meets the eye. If you knew your destiny, would you still live it? would you feel again? would you feel more? Because even a brief happy moment with someone we love makes everything worth it. That's why a general ready to declare war will change his mind in the last moment, that's why a mother who lost her child will have hope again. In all our ignorance and arrogance, there's only one thing that can make us reconsider, be better, feel more. It's been said before ""For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love"".<br/><br/>Note –the universal language we know is mathematics, and through it we could talk with any advanced civilization – but this idea had been used before in great novels like the utterly perfect ""Contact"" by Carl Sagan, later on made into a movie with a spectacular Jodie Foster's performance."

","In Arrival, two perfectly professional people, who've barely exchanged a look of sexual meaning all movie, take their relationship to the next level with the sophisticated and romantic pick- up line ""let's make a baby!""! <br/><br/>IMO that stupid quote pretty much sums up the scripting you can expect from this lame, cheesy movie. Add a dumb, lazy ending in which the future is so conveniently revealed to save the present, I'd say the writer is probably deluded enough to think his pick-up line is good. Well, it isn't and, as that line was the so-called ""climax"" of this movie, I'd prefer the alternate ending in which the Chinese let loose the dogs of war as we'd all be better off dead than living in a world where pick-up lines like ""let's make a baby!"" had any chance of success!<br/><br/>The best thing about Arrival was leaving the cinema!"

Are we to believe the military wants blacks to keep sounding poorly educated as they rise in the ranks of power and prestige? Or is it just affirmative action promoting the unqualified because of race? It was grating to hear ""we bof know dis ain't gonna work.""

It will make you think and will grab all your attention. <br/><br/>Intertwined with periodic flashbacks backed by a terrific score, Arrival will also move you and touch you. While some of the material has been done before several times, it definitely updates the ""worldwide crisis"" line of the story and even differentiates itself enough to stand apart from other movies that have done so. <br/><br/>In the end, Arrival is definitely one of the best movies of the year.

","This film was a painfully slow exercise in self indulgence. It had none of the bombastic stupidity of films like Independence day and it's even worse sequel, but equally failed to be even slightly engaging. Watching it I felt like an advertisement for globalisation, mixed with lithium.<br/><br/>While the acting was fine, it was in no way great, because it's hard to over or under act in dialogue this boring. The story was told through the perspective of the main protagonist which was a good choice, but was insufficient to overcome my lack of interest. It reminded me in certain ways like Apollo 13, in as much as it was trying to tell a first contact story in a way that is technically as realistic as we could imagine, given no one has met aliens yet. However this approach only goes so far, and my biggest issue with the film is the lack of pacing.<br/><br/>There is a subtle twist at the end which refers to numerous scenes throughout the film which if I was still interested, I would have found clever, but by that point I has ceased to care.<br/><br/>I can see why some people appreciated it, but cannot understand the waves of overwhelmingly high scores it has garnered thus far."

","Movie critics are notorious when it comes to Science Fiction movies. They usually abhor it so, when any SF movie becomes a critic's darling as this one did - I get worried. And once again, my worry meter proved true. This is a glacially slow, at times, dull film that really wastes a good cast. The story really makes no sense, other than it shows how someone can deal with loss. The SF elements are really unnecessary. I don't want to give anything away so I won't give away the big reveal. Amy Adams is great, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are good. The design of the aliens is really original (think a tree crossed with a squid and a starfish). But there just isn't enough to this film. We never really learn anything about the aliens, but plenty about human fear (which is something any SF fan already knows about). The story is just disjointed. And the ending was far from shocking in any way. In fact, I haven't seen an ending for a movie that dragged this much since A.I. It was a nice effort with some decent sfx, but other than that, there isn't much to this movie."

","I saw this a few days into its UK release, following interviews of Adams and Renner on a chat show and checking up on IMDb reviews. Initially I was disappointed that the movie wasn't shown in Imax but having now seen it I realise that the big screen would have been inappropriate, and would only serve to show up the shortcomings. The movie disappointed me greatly. Dark, claustrophobic and cheap. A droning noise masquerading as a soundtrack, sets which were no more than a few tents, an impenetrable plot only the most pretentious of whom would pretend to understand. No explanation for the aliens' presence, no action, no audience involvement. I saw little evidence of Renner's considerable talent though even this Director couldn't entirely squander Forest Whitaker and Amy Adams who, to be fair, were given little to work with. Sensibly the aliens left before the end of the movie : Take me, Take me!! If ever there was a case of The Emperor's New Clothes, this is it. Don't waste your time on it - wait for the TV showing, it shouldn't be long. The Hollywood hype machine is coming off the rails."

","(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A boring intellectual sci-fi dud.   GRADE: C-  SYNOPSIS: Another alien invasion, but more seriously-minded.  JIM'S REVIEW: One may find this review a bit odd as I begin discussing  Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, but bear with me. This popular 40's comic  duo, known for their classic skit, Who's on First, a comic  confrontation involving quick verbal wordplay, have an indirect link  with Denis Villeneuve's Arrival, but one yearns for their  lightning-fast patter to replace the slowly-paced dialog in this slog  of a sci-fi thriller. The wordplay in Eric Heisserer's boring  screenplay is in need of some of that raw energy although the  director's visual dexterity does momentarily disguise the film's  numerous flaws.  This movie-going experience is interested in the thought-provoking  cosmos more akin to Close Encounters of the Third Kind than the usual  Independence Day mayhem. Are these visitors dangerous extraterrestrials  bent on world domination...or do they travel in peace? The director and  screenwriter leave that question dangling throughout this film as we  earthlings come to terms with their sudden invasion to our planet.  Panic has invaded the thoughts and minds of the denizens of Earth (much  like the recent election results from America have permeated our  mindsets). Only this time the life-form in question is not  orange-tinted, rather grayish in tone. Twelve hovering pod-like  spacecrafts with their visitors safely aboard now dot our global skies,  a shocking reminder that we are not alone.  Coming to our aid is Louise Banks, a linguist who is enlisted to  decipher their message. As others become unnerved, Louise stays the  course. Fascinated by our visitors' communication, a series of swirling  inkblots that languish in the air, she becomes consumed with their  visual exchanges of information. It gives her purpose and helps her  forget about family tragedies which overwhelm her. Louise's depression  no longer becomes an option. She forms an uneasy alliance with Ian  Donnelly (an underused Jeremy Renner), a handsome astrophysicist as  they try to decode their uninvited guests' contact and symbolic  language. Of course, they must also contend with military and  government officials who are leery of these foreign interlopers and  eager to blast them out of the skies.  Arrival plays more like a psychological mystery than a sci-fi thriller,  an intellectual debate about them vs. us. The film takes an engaging  premise and repeatedly deconstructs its plot with too much talk and too  little action. It sets up a confusing narrative structure which follows  an inconsistent non-linear set of rules that ultimately disappoints its  audience. As Louise tries to unravel this on-going mystery, the past  yields to the present in flash-backs and flash-forwards to the point of  vertigo. Time is not the moviegoer's friend in this story. It jumbles  parallel story lines awkwardly, making the dramatic personal backstory  sketchy and lacking clarity.  Instead, the movie concentrates on the alien visit and becomes a lesson  in cryptography, physics, grammar, and basic reading comprehension  skills. The film deliberately shifts from past, present, and future  parsing into the imperfect tense. Unfortunately, the film's syntax  never creates a well-formed thought, believable character, or logical  rationale. All of the film's overdone intellectualizing dooms this  mission. Its analytical theorizing is simply lost in translation. The  film is more enamored of listening to its own voice than thoroughly  explaining the plot or its outcome. In fact, the film's final twist is  completely underwhelming and unsatisfying.  Yes, there are a few assets to the film, particularly Amy Adam's fine  performance as Louise. She is the only well defined character in the  movie and the actress anchors the weightlessness of the script's banal  dialog and heavy-handed exposition. Arrival is also well crafted and  earnest to a fault. Mr. Villeneuve's visuals are solid throughout and  Johann Johannsson's dissonant music score is quite effective in adding  to the eeriness of the proceedings.  Arrival wants to ask and answer many questions about the mysteries of  our universe. But perhaps, it should start by asking itself, ""Who's on  first?"" The answer being: ""I dunno."""
"Quinoa1984","9","13","38","10 November 2016"," a short review for a very good movie you all should see
","1) I wonder what China will make of this movie.<br/><br/>2) I hope that cinematographer Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year and Selma) takes it as a high compliment that I thought the whole time watching this ""damn, Roger Deakins, you're outdoing yourself here!"" (thinking this was his 3rd collaboration with Villeneuve) <br/><br/>3) Amy Adams is incredible, some of her best work yet, even if so much of it is based around her giant blue eyes. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker also give strong supporting work (and hey, Michael Stuhlbarg too while we're at it, and even a particular Chinese actor gets a great scene), so a well-rounded cast surrounds her.<br/><br/>4) I went in expecting Close Encounters and got a... reverse version Solaris I guess (and I mean Soberberh's Solaris). This is a welcome surprise and one I suspect a lot of viewers will embrace, though some may leave confused.<br/><br/>This is very good stuff, bordering on great, and it warrants a rewatch, though the one mark I'd say against is that it's more effective intellectually than emotionally. The ending is wonderful, but it's so much slipping around in time that you lose the thread emotionally. But Arrival is ultimately made as a film as a rebuke to the countless ""sci-fi"" spectacles that are an excuse for showing off militarism and destruction. If anything this is a really strong movie to watch considering this election week: here's what happens when communication is actually engaged, and when governments engaging in aggressive action without trying to see the 'other', literally, and it's a sobering message right now."
"MGPT80","6","2","3","13 April 2020"," Plenty to like but falls well short of greatness
","While I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from watching Arrival, it didn't really capture my imagination in the way I had hoped. It's a reasonably engrossing watch but it kind of feels like a rehash of various different sci-fi films. There was very little about the plot, the visuals or the dialogue that I haven't seen before in some form or another. There was the alien landing, the media frenzy, the civil unrest, the stern military guys and the wise and noble central character who saves the day. Throw in a boring romance and some lazy stereotypes about China and Russia and you have yourselves a generic Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>The one element of the film that stands out is the storyline with Louise and her daughter. These scenes had genuine intrigue and emotion and were nicely incorporated into the main plot. The other big positive about Arrival was the performance by Amy Adams. Her role wasn't particularly challenging but she still offered a level of subtlety and delicacy that is so often lacking in films like this. It was a huge shame that Jeremy Renner was cast alongside her as he was laughably inept by comparison. It was also unfortunate to see Forest Whitaker given such a corny one-dimensional role knowing what he is capable of as an actor.<br/><br/>Where the film went wrong was with the communication development between the humans and aliens. I won't go into detail on this as there are plenty of negative reviews that really labour the point, but it was unfeasible that things would progress the way they did. The conversation between Louise and Costello towards the end of the film was laughably corny and by this point I was just wanted it all to end.<br/><br/>The alien genre is a difficult beast to tame and very few movies have done it well. Arrival promises a lot early on and was close to pulling it off but was let down badly by some lazy writing and weak characters."
"schroederagustavo","10","2","3","5 April 2020"," The Power of Language
","There's a very old idea, that's also a constant theme of life seen throughout history. The idea that life involves a certain amount of suffering and that the best way to act in those circumstances is to accept that suffering willingly. These ideas have been carried across time into the future not only through language, but also through abstraction in the form of art, images and music. A good representation of this idea of the inevitable suffering that surrounds being is Mary holding her dead son, Jesus, in her arms. No mother should have to bear through this, but one of the most sacred images in the western world involves this representation. A good question would be why? Well, maybe it's that Mary literally embraces her suffering and does it willingly as well.<br/><br/>Arrival shares many similar themes and I believe them to be a cornerstone of the film's message. Amy Adam's character, after she discovers, let's say, the eternal language, a language that if you understand it, it no longer involves seeing time as linear, she realizes her daughter will die of a rare disease when she's about a teenager. This is also a brilliant plot twist in the film, since we are expertly led to believe through most of it that her ideas about her daughter are from the past, and not from the future. Near the end of the film, she asks her future husband ""If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?"". To which Ian responds ""Maybe I'd say what I felt more often."" Now, Amy Adams' character at this point realizes that the imminent suffering of life is worth accepting, so she goes through with it, even though she knows that it will end in misery. But she also knows that the journey with her daughter and the memories created by that will be the thing that will transcend time, not the actual suffering created by her death.<br/><br/>During the first act of the film, when both main characters meet for the first time, one of them being a linguist and the other being a physicist, sort of have the argument of ""The cornerstone of civilization isn't language, it's science."", explained by the theoretical physicist, played by Jeremy Renner. I think the film brilliantly proves his hypothesis to be wrong merely through the events that occur in the movie and without explicitly saying it with words. It becomes clear and more clear the more you get towards the end of the film that some problems cannot be solved through science, but through language and sometimes even that cannot be the case. Sometimes, only abstract representations, such as the symbols that the aliens create, can fully explain and maybe even solve a problem of communication.<br/><br/>I think the entire movie is really something else, but the complete first act of the film, from the point it begins to when they have their first encounter with the aliens, that really is some next level film making and cinematography. Truly genius level directing by Villeneuve and photography by Bradford Young. They do an excellent job throughout, not just during the first act, of the will to face the unknown and to act as bravely as you possibly can in dire circumstances.<br/><br/>Arrival is a brilliant film, one of my personal favorites and truly a statement of what can be achieved through filmmaking."

","This is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen, and I'm old enough to have seen most of them. I feel sorry for those who call it boring because, if you truly were bored, you either didn't understand it, you have a short attention span and can only focus long enough to see movement and shiny things, or you have no feelings. Either way, you are disadvantaged and the poorer for missing out on appreciating one of the most profound films ever produced. Why is it such a good film? First, there are no films that defy being categorized like this one. Sure, it's called a science fiction but, honestly, its way more than that. In terms of a genre, it's actually a combination of a science fiction with squid monsters, an intellectual study on communication and how it might affect your thoughts and actions, an exploration into the nature of time and its perception, a commentary on human behavior and the state of mankind such as man's tendency to jump to conclusions and make rash decisions, a mystery to be solved, a romance, a story of great grief and loss and, finally and most importantly, a bitter sweet statement on the value and beauty of life, all life, even life that doesn't last that, in the end, includes everyone's life. Secondly, Arrival does all of these things very well and weaves each element together seamlessly into something beautiful and thought provoking. It makes a statement like a philosopher. Like a great poem or piece of art, it forces one to think, to wonder, to feel, to understand love, to feel grief and loss, to ponder what is and what is important. I'm richer for having seen it and I give credit to those who achieved it. I can't believe they were able to do it and to do it so well."

","In the opening scenes we see protagonist Louise Banks raising and ultimately losing a daughter. We then see her lecturing in linguistics in a university; her class seems poorly attended but it soon emerges that there is a good reason for that... news is breaking of the arrival of twelve alien space ships. They are hovering at various points around the world just above the Earth's surface. Louise is approached by Colonel G.T. Weber of the US Military to help them try to communicate with the craft above Montana. Here she is teamed up with scientist Ian Donnelly. Upon entering the ship they meet two seven limbed aliens, dubbed 'heptopods'. It immediately becomes clear that their method of communication is unlike any human language. Gradually a basic vocabulary is developed; then a potentially worrying message is received... it may be an offer, or a threat or just a misunderstanding. Some countries take it as a threat and prepare to attack the crafts above their countries. If peace is to be maintained Louise and Ian will have to decipher the aliens' final message.<br/><br/>If you are hoping for the sort of sci-fi that delivers lots of fasts moving action and sexy, almost human, aliens then you are in for a disappointment. If however you want an intelligent, ideas led story then you should watch this. Most science fiction conveniently avoids the problems of communication with ideas such as 'universal translators', 'translator microbes' of a fish you stick in your ear but this film is all about establishing communications. As such it moves at a fairly slow pace with much of the action set in drab rooms... this doesn't mean it was boring though; I was thoroughly engrossed and the twists, which I won't spoil, surprised me without being too convenient or irritating. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner impress as Louise and Ian and Forest Whitaker is solid in the role of Col. Weber. The rest of the cast is pretty good too. I feared that the ending might not live up to what went before but thankfully it did. Overall a great film that fans of more cerebral sci-fi need to watch... that's not meant as an insult to action packed space operas like 'Star Wars' or the high camp of 'Flash Gordon'; I love those as well!"

","Arrival takes a great approach to the alien contact concept. It showcases the flaws of humanity and also the intricacies of linguistics. The cast, while small, works incredibly well together and creates some awesome chemistry. The soundtrack is a crazy orchestral soundtrack that creates a duper dramatic feeling for most scenes. The end of the movie deals with some really complex conceptual sci-fi kind of stuff but instead of treating it like an actual sci-fi it instead takes on this much more serious tone. I feel like the main character deteriorates by the end of the film in comparison to her start as well. Solid but generally not quite compelling enough to draw in the audience."
"neshawk","10","2","3","20 June 2019"," Underrated sci-fi
","No, not an over-done cgi blob thrown on a screen with a lot of extra pointless action. Or, an over the top mistimed plot twist or climax.<br/><br/>I thought this movie had a good steady pace. Both, main actors did great. The epiphanies/flash backs had a lot of mystery and played a puzzle that you tried to piece together.<br/><br/>The special effects and soundtrack were perfect for this movie. It also had an ending that was original and memorable. Nothing like I can remember for a sci fi movie. I waste way too many hours these days watching somewhat decent movies only to be left with the director and screen writers not knowing how to give a movie a solid ending.<br/><br/>For the time, space travel, e.t.s, science, etc. it has been ages since Hollywood has come out with anything that comes close to making me feel it all could be somewhat believable. My other example off the top of my head would be the movie Contact.<br/><br/>You have movies like Arrival and then on the other end of the spectrum you have movies like The Transformers series and Armageddon. This one is going to be hard to beat when it come to the technicalities that make a great sci fi movie. As someone who has studied many hours of anthropology and linguistics, I thought this movie was spot on! I watch it anytime it comes on tv."

The conversations are monosyllabic and the technical linguistics oversimplified. The sentimental effect of constantly jumping back to a dying child is an example of how Hollywood is hopeless at emotion.. Everything has to be hammered home with dull thuds of a sledgehammer. There is a dubious reference to time travel or something something about time being linear... There is quite a lot of confused continuity regarding what's happening in the holding Bay...

"david-meldrum","9","2","3","15 April 2019"," A thoughtful, haunting take on a familiar story - with layers to explore
","I didn't realise this was such a dark film. Seeing it in the cinema on release I had been so overwhelmed by the sound, the cinematography and Amy Adams's mesmeric performance that this passed me by. I'm not talking about tone, of course; this films ends in a place of hope and invitation. I mean in light levels. Most - or all? - of the exterior scenes of the film take place in shadows, or with the sun evidently just one side of the horizon or the other. Interiors are low lit also; I notice two exceptions - the spotlight shone from a helicopter in to Amy Adams's face when Forest Whitaker returns to pick her up in the early stages of the story, the second towards the film's end, when the whole screen is bathed in white smoke as one character goes behind the screen that had separated people from the alien visitors up to that point. It all points to a person - and a human race - living in the half-light of partial understanding; unaware that there's a light that can be turned on until someone (or something else) does it instead.<br/><br/>In many respects this film tells a familiar story of alien first contact with earth, and tells it as a thoughtful drama rather than an action spectacular. Like many science-fiction stories, this is one concerned with how we as a species and as individuals understand ourselves, and how we conceive of 'the other' - whether that's people or beings different to us, or God. It's certainly the case that even on the small screen this is a film that's deeply effective in evoking a sense of wonder; it may only be just over 30 minutes in to the film when we first see the aliens, but the lighting, the camera's repeated reminding us of Amy Adams's aloneness, the sound design and the remarkable score all evoke a sense of encounter with something that is truly different, alien in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>Amy Adams's performance is towering; she seems to be on screen for at least 95% of the run time; for much of that time we seem to be following her from behind or looking in to her face, a face blessed with the ability to express volumes. This film was always going to stand or fall on her performance; as a result, it stands very tall indeed.<br/><br/>The film initially sets itself up as a struggle between science (in the shape of Jeremy Renner's character, a theoretical physicist) and language (Amy Adams); but it becomes more than that. Breakthrough in communication with the aliens is only achieved when Adams, followed by Renner, break out of the strict, rigid almost ritualistic structures laid down by science and the military; maybe it's because I'm a priest and I was watching it in Holy Week, that I saw more than a hint of a reference to the curtain in the temple, separating people from God, through which only one priest could go and which was torn in two by Jesus' crucifixion.<br/><br/>There's something in that, however. So often words and laboratories, religion and science, mind and heart are pitted against each other. In Arrival we see the fruit of something else; something the film calls a 'non-zero sum' game, a movement beyond linear, binary thinking in to something more fluid, more supple. If moving beyond the boundaries laid down by military and science gives humanity a breakthrough in communicating with the aliens, it's a departure from conventional 'zero sum', straight line thinking that is the key to the whole mystery and crisis that forms the heart of the film.<br/><br/>Like Arthur C Clarke's classic 1950s novel Childhood's End (clearly an influence on both this film and its source text), the vision of humanity presented could easily be something so optimistic and naive as to be of no use. Certainly that's where Childhood's End left me; but I felt differently on rewatching Arrival. Of course, right and wrong, truth and falsehood and many others are binaries we need - too much blurring of the lines leaves with an epidemic of uncertainty and fake news. This time around, however, I was reminded of how I characterise my own thinking as someone with ADD and two learning disabilities; not neuro-typical, I guess you would say. I say that I don't think in straight lines; I think in blobs. Then I try to string the blobs together, make connections in order to form coherent thought and output (or not ... ). Straight lines can be helpful; but I find it very difficult to follow them.<br/><br/>A valuing of intuitive, relational thinking can also make us a bit more humble, a little less keen to make it all about us. Especially useful when it comes to the 'other' - the other person, culture, lifestyle or God. Trying to build bridges with something or someone utterly different to us needs more than a straight line-rationale; it needs a humble willingness to take the long, winding road of presence, listening and submission. When it comes to God, it comes with the awareness that we can't build the bridge ourselves; we have to accept that all our rationality will only get us so far, and instead accept the invitation to the humble submission of walking across a bridge which we had no hand in building - and which for much of the time, we can't see the other side of, or even much more than a step or two in front of us.<br/><br/>Arrival, in the form of Amy Adams's portrayal of a linguistics expert learning a new of way of speaking and thinking, presents us with a humbling invitation to engagement with others and the Other; a vision which requires us to step beyond the straight lines we naturally default to, a commitment to the long and winding road of another's design. It is in the letting go that we take up, the losing that we find, the dying that we live."

","Amy Adams acts her heart out in the role of Louise Banks, a renowned linguist who's recruited by the military when 12 mysterious spacecraft touch down (well, so to speak) in odd spots around the globe. The military hopes to get her to break through to the aliens and determine the nature of this otherworldly visit. Meanwhile, Louise is understandably sombre after having suffered a devastating personal tragedy. Much of the plot hinges on this incredible gift that Louise has, which she will attempt to utilize to avoid disaster.<br/><br/>It's better not to reveal any more about story; some of these details and twists may actually come as unexpected.<br/><br/>At first glance, this seems to be a somewhat different approach to alien ""invasion"" cinema. It's more intelligent than some entries into the genre, and more subtle, attempting to put a more ""realistic"" spin on what might happen were the people of Earth to be actually visited by an extraterrestrial intelligence. It's not for people who want action and spectacle. After a while, you do realize that this also a true human-interest drama, perhaps too drawn-out and manipulative to some viewers, but will definitely hit home for any parent who's ever lost a child, and/or had to watch them suffer.<br/><br/>The film co-stars Jeremy Renner, as the scientist with whom Louise will work, Forest Whitaker, as a no-nonsense colonel supervising their efforts, Michael Stuhlbarg, as a CIA agent, and Tzi Ma, as a Chinese general who stirs the pot a bit. But make no mistake: this is almost entirely Amys' show, and her character is worthy of much sympathy and compassion, even if she seems to act senselessly at times.<br/><br/>While ""Arrival"" is to be commended for concentrating more on human emotions than visual effects, it must be said that the design of the ""Heptapods"" (affectionately dubbed ""Abbott"" and ""Costello"" by Renner) is pretty effective. The other visuals on the alien ship are similarly striking.<br/><br/>Overall, an affecting statement on the beauty of life and the way that the human race perceives things.<br/><br/>Scripted by Eric Heisserer, based on the story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

The film is well made and well acted but surely a better ending could be found than the one chosen. Decent scifi films have been thin on the ground of late and this one does little to alter that. The story is that aliens want our help in the distant future and need us pulling together now to be able to provide that help later. Later never comes to this film though.<br/><br/>I'll go so far as to suggest that this film ought to have been in two parts with the second part concentrating on what happens when the aliens return for our help in the future.

"fleamarcat","5","2","3","20 February 2017"," left the cinema all confused and unhappy it's almost hilarious
","*** This review contains spoilers ***<br/><br/>Saw it last night and left the cinema all confused and unhappy and in total disbelief the movie ended the way it did. <br/><br/>First part of the movie was very cool and exciting. You have your weird genius protagonist convincingly portrayed by the amazing Amy Adams. She's a linguistics professor who decides to continue her daily routine amidst what was happening in her world. She appears to have no friends --- she wound up alone in her campus the next day of the ""arrival"", with a puzzled look that no one else is around. Clearly, none of her colleagues or students texted her: GIRL, ALIENS ARE HERE. DO NOT GO TO SCHOOL. But that was just a fun and flippant observation from me and my sister so whatever.<br/><br/>When we saw the spacecraft, I remember myself being awed and extremely impressed. It looks to me like this giant metal leech --- very menacing and has this particular quiet sinister in it (much like real life leeches, of which I am very fearful of thus the mental effect of the spacecraft's shape to me). The movie also has one of the best shots, not only from the movie but from all the alien- invasion movies I've seen so far: that dramatic aerial shot of the wide American rural fields towards the spacecraft, made even more dramatic by those freaky rolling clouds and chilling af musical accompaniment. <br/><br/>The aliens look cool as well; I never thought tame giant squids could be potent replacement for the usual aggressive lizard-like aliens in movies. So everything was going great and exciting, our lead is able to befriend the aliens and has made them respond to her in their own language through this ink-like substance. So yey that's so cool they're so cute was mostly my reaction. HOWEVER as the story progressed and the characters are still trying to figure out the aliens' language a month after the initial back-and-forth communication, I felt that the movie was losing its charm swiftly thanks to Amy's character having to deal with her dead daughter's memories. At first we'd think they're only flashbacks and you somehow empathize with the mother's grief. But in the end it was revealed that they were actually memories from the future. Like girl, why didn't you freak out from these recurring freaky 'memories'? Aren't you supposed to call your mom or any friend that something this freaky is happening to you? Sheesh. And to think she would pass out almost every time she has these visions. Girl was def not freaked out about it. So that part of the story was really emotionally vexing for me and it was already taking away so much emphasis from the other themes that the movie has introduced and needs to address more such as learning the Heptapod's language, the different ways nations are dealing with the arrival, or even why Jeremy Renner's character, oh scratch that, all characters there were rendered almost useless. <br/><br/>And that conversation with the Chinese General part... we were definitely one of those who left the cinema pondering about it, clueless af it felt hilarious. <br/><br/>The reviews I saw for this film were almost polar opposites. You either deem it as extraordinary and mind-blowing or boring and unsatisfying. Well, if you have read this long review of mine in its entirety, you know where I stand.<br/><br/>thefleamarcat.com"

","Arrival is basically a combination of Contact and Signs. It has the atmosphere and feel of Signs and the story of Contact. Though, I think it ends up being better than both those films. This is mainly due to the ending. Both Contact and Signs started out really interesting and engaging, but then started to lose it by the third act, and then the ending ruins it. With Signs the ending was just lame; with Contact the ending was both lame and confusing. With the amount of build-up this film gives us in the first and second acts the ending could have been a complete letdown just like those films were. Thankfully, this film does not drop the ball on the ending, which makes Arrival a cut above the rest. Despite that I would not call Arrival a phenomenon like most praise as. It's definitely a good movie, but I was not blown away by it.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, the story is very similar to contact where humanity finally has contact with alien visitors and the main character Louise, played by Amy Adams, is trying to find a way to decipher their language and communicate back to them. The differences that, unlike Contact where the characters are deciphering a message and we never actually see the aliens, here the extraterrestrials actually come to Earth and the humans communicate with them directly, which makes the film more visually interesting.<br/><br/>The film also has a very gloomy atmosphere to it, very much like Signs or a Christopher Nolan film. If I did not know the director and people said Nolan directed this movie I would believe it, especially with the ending, which is something he would concoct.<br/><br/>The movie looks great in spite of the gloomy atmosphere. The effects team did an amazing job with the visuals. The score, while not the most memorable, also did its job at setting the mood of the scene.<br/><br/>The main thing about this film that prevents it from being a masterpiece for me is the characters. Amy Adams is fine but the rest of the cast I thought was lacking. The one thing Signs does better than this film and Contact, in my opinion, is the characters. I was invested in Mel Gibson and his family more than the cast in Arrival and Contact. You got good actors like Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, but their characters were rather bland. Jeremy Renner's character felt rather pointless in the film until the very end when his role becomes clear. Even so, the film does not make him a compelling character and his chemistry with Amy Adams felt a little forced.<br/><br/>Plus, while you understand their importance by the end, there are many scenes that drag and drag down the pacing a little. Also, while the ending is good, there are a few scenes that feel odd or didn't really make sense with what the ending was going for, which I won't reveal to avoid spoilers. That's more of a nitpick, but it bugs me.<br/><br/>Overall, if you enjoyed Signs and/or Contact, or even aspects of those films you'll like Arrival. If you like Interstellar, Inception, or just about anything directed by Christopher Nolan you'll enjoy Arrival. I'd say it's definitely one of, if not the best alien invasion film to come out in a long time. I didn't think it was spectacular like most did, but it's definitely solid."

","There's so much to say about this movie. It combines a great story with well-executed and intentional filmmaking. The black and gray palette contrasted with the warm orange shows up so much you can't help but feel the way they want you to, as the emotion is literally in the colors. Its sounds are so perfect and powerful that they stick with you. They add so much to the film and are so much more than just a layer of soundtrack. The use of silence, deep bass, and the canary all show up repeatedly, and they set the tone for each scene without standing out. My only complaint is that some of the exposition is handled clumsily.
As far as conclusions go, the way it ramps up to the denouement is very powerful and one that leaves you thinking even after the movie ends. It's complex, but after it's explained, it makes sense.
I loved this movie. On the whole it's well made and the performances were brilliant. The twist and complexity are everything I can ask for in a movie. This is a must see for anyone."
"nizzambaharuddin","10","1","1","13 January 2020"," A MASTERPIECE
","SPOILER-FREE<br/><br/>Attention to anyone who's planning on watching this movie. If you going into this expecting the movie to be like Independence Day, Edge of Tomorrow (a very good movie regarless), or Battleship, then you will be deeply disappointed. This is not your typical alien invasion movie filled with non-stop action, and a gun-toting protagonist
who shouts profanity and spout random pop culture references. But that's okay, it doesn't need to be that kind of movie. There's plenty of movies out there to fill that void. This movie is more closer to something like 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Interstellar. It is movie full of concepts that challenge our mind. Yet, it somehow display a bigger simple theme than most movie. And really, that where it shines best.<br/><br/>I was already a fan of Denis Villeneuve ever since I saw Sicario (another movie with a female protagonist). Sicario was my favorite movie of his. That is, until Arrival arrived (pun intended). This was his first big budget movie and it definitely catapulted him to become today's top new Hollywood director (his next project is Blade Runner. The movie is a slow-paced drama. Imagine it being like an onion. Until all the layers are peeled off, you won't really know what's really going on. Sure, there are hints around (I managed to figure out what the plot is about almost a 3/4 of my viewing), most would really just be scratching their head throughout the movie. But
the events that take around during the final few scenes, or after you have figured out what exactly happens, it is one of the most satisfying scene ever. Yet, somehow it can make us feel even sadder. And might even us question some of these ""bigger picture"" concept.<br/><br/>The movie proves that us humans have these fundamental programs built into our minds. We will always fear what we don't understand. It is a notion that we can't deny or escape. It also have a very simple theme, yet we can all agree that we haven't been able to fulfill that very theme throughout most of our entire human race existence. The concept of the main heavy subject is even more applaudable when it is compared with the same concept in Islam. It has almost the same idea. But with a more imaginative execution. It also managed to fill just enough space for a fanatic sci-fi to watch it again. The scene where they first enter the heptapod is one of the most memorable scenes in sci-fi movies recently. So there's definitely enough discussion provided for just about the most of us.<br/><br/>The first and final scenes were very strong, emotionally. It made us not just sympathise with the characters, it also made us feel like we're there with them because the theme is very universal. How would you feel if you have the same knowledge as Amy Adams' character, Louise Banks? The technical part of the movie is sublime too. The cinematography is mostly consists of these ""a sight to behold"" shots. It doesn't rely too much on CGI. So it definitely will stand the test of time. The score (sountrack for those not familiar with the term) are also gripping and catchy when it needs to. Particular for the first and final scene. It definitely contributed to those few teary eyes.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this a must watch movie for most of us except for the hardcore popcorn cookie-cutter movies fan. It deserved to be mentioned, praised, and rewatched again and again in the next few years. And the years after that."

"don2507","8","1","1","26 October 2019"," An Intelligent Sci-fi Look at Communicating with Aliens
","""Arrival"" depicts the arrival of multiple spaceships that land at various places on Earth (including Montana), and the resulting attempts of each nation where the ships have landed to communicate with the extraterrestrials and ascertain their intentions. The U.S. military authorities hire a Professor of Linguistics and a Professor of Theoretical Physics to identify the vocabulary and meaning of the aliens' strange language of complex visual configurations, and the linguist (Amy Adams) becomes the center of focus in this film. ""Arrival"" is decidedly not a ""space opera"" as it is a thoughtful, well-researched exploration of communication ""mediums"" between living beings who know nothing of each other. ""The day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) took the easy route by having the lone alien communicate in English (presumably picked up by monitoring radio traffic); ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" used musical notes to get the terrestrials and extraterrestrials in synch; Carl Sagan's ""Contact"" used a repeating sequence of prime numbers to signify a living intelligence (It is fun to note that the Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977 contained the ""Voyager Golden Records"" that contained, with much input from Sagan, mathematical formulas like the derivation of Pi, plus chemical structures, not to mention 55 ancient and modern languages).<br/><br/>The Aliens do not apparently use a phonetic alphabet as their written language, featured in the film, is distinct from their spoken language. I have three final comments to make about this film: (1) I give intellectual heft to this film by its invoking the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, namely that the structure of a language determines how you think and experience the world. The Aliens' language moves in circles and thus they have a circular, not linear, view of time. The irony is that this hypothesis is now discredited by Noam Chomsky and modern linguists who argue that all languages have a common grammatical structure. But of course, who's to say how our extraterrestrials' brains evolved? (2) Why do these films, including ""Arrival,"" have military types who think early 21st century weaponry is sufficient to destroy creatures who are capable of interstellar travel? (3) For that matter, what on earth do these aliens, presumably so far advanced beyond our capabilities, think we could do for them in 3,000 years?"

I read the novella ""The Story of your Life"" and i loved it, but the movie adaptation leaves me weak and questioning my existence every time i watch it. From beginning to end, Amy Adams leaves me wondering what is coming next as her role as Louise. I'm feeling every emotion with her. The monotony she feels teaching, the annoyance she feels on the phone with her mom, the heartbreak of seeing what happens to her daughter, and the sense of astonishment when she meets the aliens. She carries the audience on her back in this movie. The rest of the cast is great, but Amy Adams is beyond anything I've ever seen before. Johan Johanson absolutely nailed the score and soundtrack. The aliens aren't overtly fake looking. The directing was divine. Everything in this movie is superb. Any way, the storyline is the best emotionally straining, Sci-fi film that makes you THINK at the end of it. I have an existential moment of questioning every time i watch it.

One disappointment: when they show an Arabic TV channel broadcasting, the Arabic language is written wrongly. I am not saying it didn't make sense, it was wrongly written. As this movie is talking about universal language, it disappoints me to see the mistake done here. People are watching movies around the world, we watch these movies and we would like to see it done properly. It is not only shown in US or Europe. Even there, there are a lot of Arabs.

"kevinleetokyo","10","1","1","16 February 2019"," A brand new view of the fundamental question of cause & effect
","Arrival is my personal favorite of 2016, where Denis Villeneuve created a seemingly new interpretation on one of our fundamental understanding of the world in cinematic history.
In traditional Buddhism and several other cultures, there a fundamental rule of cause & effect. It says, everything is the effect or consequence of someone/ something's actions, where they supposedly act with their reasons and using that logic anything cannot happen without a cause. I have found it very real, and I believe this movie has given me a new view of my understanding of this ancient philosophy. In the film, it once seemed like the Aliens invaded earth, a neighbor-friendly planet. However, after Dr. Banks recognized the truth of Heptapodian, the alien language where speakers spoke in circles, with an encrypted start & end. The unique feature of their language made them able to know the cause & effect (result) of anything related to the matter being spoken. Hence, they can understand the beginning of everything, and primarily the impact/ consequence of everything long before the things took place in human's, our, normal timeline. (not sure normal can be defined this way tho) The Heptapods, are doing things that know will be done by them, where they can see the future without the ability to alter it with their wills. It is a fascinating setting, even for a fictional species of alien, where people generally have an extraordinary imagination. Dr. Banks' ability to master that language made her almost omnipotent on her knowledge of everything that will happen in her life. She knew about the death of her daughter, the break-up between her husband and her, even before she met the aliens. Tho, it brought me back to the question over cause & effect. As narrated in the movie, the arrival of the Heptapods was justified to a great extent. The purpose of their lives can be seen as doing things that have to been done, with an unknown reason for their inability to alter the future that they knew, or they can but ethically refuse to do so. Dr. Banks, unfortunately, met the same fate, where she knew about heart-breaking moments that will happen in her life, as well as the pains she will carry, but she obeys the future anyway, which took extraordinary courage, since that much passion is hard to find on an expert linguist with an outstanding reputation. If one knew the cause & effect of everything in his/ her life, what would they possibly do? The movie seemed to have given a perfect answer, where one being, no matter races, would do things that require to be done while having zero freedom of choices. In many religions, there's always a belief of fate, where we, human, do things that we think are the choices we made, but are already destined to be so, including our thoughts on making the decision. But what if fate can be known? Does arrival say that the person will do the same thing that he/she did before, or is it also a part of his/her fate?
I know most of these things bring applause to the screenplay writers, but the way those profoundly philosophical things were carried out in the film was appallingly amazing. The heart-shaking moments were processed calmly and wisely, where matters related to family, love, relationship, alien, life, cause & effect can rarely be discussed in a film without any fusses.
Arrival is a marvelous masterpiece."
"pollomasamira","7","1","1","13 February 2019"," Overall a good movie
","It is a 116 minute slow-burner all heavy on atmosphere and light on explosions or any quick thrills. If you wish a quick reference to any recent well-known movies, the result is a bit like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar crossed with Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life. Robert Zemeckis's Contact (1997) would not be very far either, because Arrival also focuses on fragile yet brave female protagonist whose quality acting is one of the main pillars carrying the whole experience. The other one would be overall atmosphere, deliciously dark and ominous. Some will like it, others will probably find it depressing and maybe a bit slow for their taste."

","In ARRIVAL, we see a couple of highly trained linguists, played by Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, brought in by the military to try and communicate with a network of strange alien ships that have positioned themselves around different places on Earth. Quickly revealed is the hawk vs. dove position, as the opposing forces on Earth express their opinions in trying to decide if the aliens' intentions are hostile or peaceful.<br/><br/>Kudos to the cinematography in the movie, but it ends there. As the movie progresses, we in the audience become lost in the flashbacks that Amy Adams' character endures, somehow trying to tie the memories she has with her daughter to the ability to see into the future, giving her the magic ability to talk to the aliens. By the end, it became too convoluted to follow, and too easy to stop caring about the fate of the main characters."

No idea what the purpose of the alien visit was. No idea what Jeremy Renner's character had to do with anything. No idea what time period Amy Adam's character was living in. No idea how Amy Adam's character was able to stop the Chinese from attacking the aliens. No idea why the daughter had to die or how her life tied into anything. No idea why Adams and Renner were expelled from the ship by the Aliens at one point. No idea why it was thought the aliens had spoken of a 'weapon.' No idea how this has received an 8 rating (at the time of this review) on IMDb.<br/><br/>I'm amazed at the 'alphabet' the writer of this film was able to develop, but for me, it was one of those movies that is supposed to be intelligent yet makes little sense to most viewers.

Predictably misunderstandings and tension erupt between the new arrivals and their earthling hosts. <br/><br/>The solution is of course communication and co-operation both between earthlings and the new arrivals, as well as between the different nations on Earth. Its also predictable that the main character finds insight through her own personal life.

","This is why I fell in love with film, plain and simple, this film right here is the reason.<br/><br/>This is not the average sci fi you think it is, it most definitely is not my friend, this is a pure masterpiece in film and science fiction combined, and honestly the best film of 2016. Adapted from Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of your Life"" into cinema at its very best.<br/><br/>When earth is suddenly startled by the arrival of mysterious pebble shaped space crafts or ""shells"", Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is called in to assist in contacting with the lifeforms that dwell within. Using her knowledge of language and translation her and Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) become the interpreters of the world as they try to learn and communicate with the extraterrestrial beings that are visiting the planet.<br/><br/>A marvellous masterpiece at the hands of Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario, and Enemy), who seems to create pure cinematic artwork in any situation, whether its cartel war, scary kidnapping thriller, and now he has proved that he can do with science fiction, I very much looking forward to the upcoming Blade Runner 2049. Sharing a similar theme and structure to the works of Christopher Nolan, the French Canadian director has created a compelling science fiction blockbuster that treats its audience with intelligence and respect. Also feeling familiar vibes from the works of Ridley Scott and the great Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>Arrival is artwork, one of the greatest piece of modern science fiction, and must be appreciated for it, with all usually element that make a film a film being absolutely magnificent. From the opening tilt shot that very slowly zooms in, you know that this is going to be an amazing and stunning watch. Like The Revenant 50% of the this film is the cinematography by Bradford Young, telling its very own story in every single shot. Every scene is a piece of artwork itself (literally) presenting the melancholy atmosphere that Villeneuve is a custom for doing. Especially in the scenes where we enter he valley of mystery we are so glued to the screens and engulfed by what we see. There is a phenomenal circulating aerial shot over the open field where the main shell hangs with the mystic white cloud floating in the air. Every shot where the shell is seen, there is the unsettling sinister vibe that is emitted, similar to the black Monolith.<br/><br/>But what secondly really empowers and makes up 15% of the film is Jóhann Jóhannsson's score, another key aspect that journeys us into the story. This a literal face melting score, (I promise you my face really melted). This is what also takes me back to the music as featured in Blade Runner and 2001, and also Sicario. This combined with the camera and editing made me fall in love with the film. It contains of the most intelligent pieces of editing work (Joe Walker).<br/><br/>At the very heart of Arrival is the story, the solid heavy idea of alien translation. This idea is one is never really focused on in alien arrival movies, and is most definitely pulls it off and even journeys into a cloudburst of wondrous, emotional, and insightful story telling. Being an Alien movie, Arrival also focuses the identity in humanity, reflecting a mirror at our political relations with other countries, and tries to brings us together in this event. Mark Kermode said that this is the best film to watch after the week we've had. There is a point where I was slightly unsure where the film was taking us, but by the end I was satisfied and happy to say that it contributed even more to whole effect of the film.<br/><br/>Along with this is Amy Adam's spot on performance, it is only by the end of the film that I really appreciated her performance from the whole film. Viewing events truly through her eyes, we are encaptivated by what is happening, and are convinced that this is what would happen in real life. Jeremey Renner delivers his role as the standard good guy which creates remarkable chemistry with Amy Adams.<br/><br/>If you see any film this year, make it Arrival, I don't care how much you want to see The Accountant, you goes see Arrival. You don't even have to be a massive science fiction fan. A solid and professional masterpiece. 10/10"

","Tarkovsky's ""Mirror"" husband-wife dreaming of baby, scene is used when Amy Adams says ""do you want to have a baby"". Great homage to history of film.<br/><br/>Aliens: ""Use your Weapon"" in the script is never answered literally. Yet what that means (I won't tell what that is) is acted out. The possible answers are brilliant. We artists can learn from that, pure cinema, pure art. This is not literature. Even past the end of film we the audience have to put together the literal answer to that question, but the meaning has already entered our heart, and thus Art was already committed. That's why it is so engaging. We the audience provide the answer to the scripted words, even though we are shown by the feeling and acting, we aren't sure, so we have to think, engage, and answer the question, as humans.<br/><br/>Critically. I'm not a fan of the maudlin, boring neo-Communist, neo-Marxist ""we are all one and have have talk"" mundane story line. But Adams creates enough dreamworld to move people beyond those ""Marxist Universalist Utopia"" story element in the plot to carry the story to both a more profound depth and and arcing height. I think Amy Adams can elevate any script to that of legends. <br/><br/>Amy Adams should compete with Lana Gulevich (Gulag Vorktua 2016) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5768140/ to win an Academy Award, they are both mind blowing in totally carrying us out of where we are to some imaginary space. Hats off to the director Villeneuve allowing Amy to carry it and allowing DP Young to shoot portraits from back 3/4 behind, as it was instrumental in getting us near the minds of the characters, a Circumspection POV, as though we are looking at themselves from the back of their heads, where ideas develop. Congrats on director for allowing F/1.2 plane focus shots even when they drifted off. As a film director/editor, I know it takes to guts fight for those artistic shots, but you reach into those spaces where feelings are in us and thus engage us. <br/><br/>I took three pages of notes in the theater during the screening. Amazing film. Villeneuve, Adams, DP Young, all need to be put on people's short lists."

","This is good old fashioned cerebral, heady, thought-provoking science- fiction. It's also a somber picture; one that tries ambitiously to meld the heart with the mind. It mostly works, though in spite of what many are calling a formulaic plot (it's necessary, I think, and part of a larger theme).<br/><br/>Amy Adams is basically herself but with the usual variations; this is her as stern, determined, soft-spoken thinker, broken or maybe always has been. It's a subtly engaging performance, the kind Adams has been doing great work with for a while now.<br/><br/>The score is foreboding and ominous, fitting in not just with sci-fi history but also the kind of emotional tinkering Arrival plays with. Villenueve is a master of slow building suspense using striking and casual compositions in alternating rhythms.<br/><br/>I wish Renner had been given more to do, more depth, more anything really. And I really wish the decoding of the language wasn't glossed over in a montage. It was built up as an incredibly complex and nearly impossible task, and then suddenly they had made really good progress with it. A few more minutes could have done wonders here."
"svorva","8","6","15","12 December 2016"," Sci Fi Film of the Year
","I might be a bit late to the party, but I am solipsistic enough that I feel the need to get my opinion on the record. As of writing, there are 500+ IMDb user reviews about Arrival. The reactions are binary. Arrival is a science fiction masterpiece (oft compared to either Contact, 2001, or Close Encounters)* or Arrival is dribble (boring, unintelligible). I'll address this criticism, but first I will claim that Arrival is the victim/beneficiary of high expectations. Arrival first hit theaters with 100% Fresh rating from a certain other website and currently sits within IMDb's top 100 movies. This hype polarizes responses. Fans will drift toward the critical consensus and the disappointed will be furious. Even worse, Arrival has a twist. There is no middle ground for twists. I sympathize with some of the naysayers' complaints, but I still think Arrival is the sci fi film of the year. <br/><br/>Arrival opens with a montage of mother and daughter. The mother is our protagonist, Louise Banks (Adams), who is a leading linguistics expert. We learn Banks is separated and her daughter Hanna is suffering from a rare disease which she succumbs to in adolescence. This death sets a tone of melancholia that manifests in reoccurring greys, blacks, and blues. Cut to the main story where Banks is trying to teach, but the entire campus seems distracted. Twelve black legume ships have suddenly appeared in seemingly random locations throughout the world. Despite the mysterious arrival, these ships remain stoic. Still, governments and their citizens are in panic. Banks and physicists Donnelly (Renner) are recruited by Colonel Weber (Whitaker) to make sense of this situation. After arriving at the military base overseeing a ship in Montana, Banks learns every 18 hours she is expected to ascend into the ship where she can communicate with the aliens between a translucent screen. Banks must learn a language without human parallels while struggling with her brutish military supervisors. Worse, an international contingent lead by General Shang wants to end intellectual cooperation and declare war on the extraterrestrials. Everyone can agree the first act is best. Banks immediately establishes herself as an intellectual force to be reckoned with. Despite the military's unrealistic expectations, Banks is able to conjure anecdotes or defy expectations in order to maintain her position. Banks plays the character brilliantly subdued, maybe even cold. The tone works because it is supported by her back story and legitimizes her scholarly theory. Science, even when legitimate and studied by filmmakers, can sound downright hokey when spouted by caricatures. Not here. Another fact that becomes obvious fast is Arrival's excellent cinematography. I have been critical of director Villeneuve in the past, but I have never failed to mention that the shots in his films are gorgeous. There are some interior shots and vistas that will please veteran eyes, but all will be enthralled and nervous during Banks first ascension into the ship. Another Villeneuve trademark, Johann Johannsson returns as composer and he deserves partial credit for Arrival's dramatic scenes. The track underscoring the ascension seems a blend of Tarkovsky's ethereal soundtracks and the monolith's theme in 2001 (last time I mention that film, I promise). I don't think I am being over laudatory and I hope even most detractors are with me so far. Now let us wade into the more contentious. <br/><br/>Arrival is not devoid of squishy sentimentality or tropes. The child's early demise, beings questioning time and the nature humanity, you gotta expect some grandiose lines. Tropes: The military is in control and they are ineffectual blockheads trying to interfere with our hero promoting cooperation. Meh. I think it is unreasonable to ask filmmakers to reinvent the wheel with every movie. Start with the familiar, then innovate. Arrival accomplished this so I was never bothered. Many think the science speak devolved into mumbo jumbo and lines went past Hollywood into the realm of silly. One German commentator noted a line from Arrival literally translates to a slogan for a popular dental hygiene brand. Touché. Still, can't say I noticed. Then there are the Renner fans I never realized existed. Their consensus was his role is a throwaway. Unfair, his character works if you view him as a compliment to the protagonist. Donnelly is the only other person in Bank's intellectual stratosphere and her lone supporter. Finally, Arrival feels long. The structure is responsible. Arrival consists of two long buildups, first the ascension then the climax. The first crescendo is tense, the second is grueling. I fidgeting around the 90 minute mark, but I found redemption in the finale. Walking out of the theater, I could only wonder how my flawed perspective colored past events. Was my interpretation damaged once my framework collapses in the final moments? My silent contemplation consumed all my attention. There were flaws, but they were forgotten. I wish all audiences could have reached that state. That sounds pretentious, but I only wish this so people could enjoy Arrival as much as I did."

","One thing is clear.When the movie arrived it shocked me.From the first scene until the last it was worth it.It is a must-see.But,for those who haven't seen it,let me give an advise.Try to read and see as less things as possible about Arrival before you see it.<br/><br/>The director,Denis Villeneuve,who is now working on the sequel of Blade Runner did an excellent work turning the wonderful plot of Eric Haisserer. into a high-quality film.The movie is based on the novel ""The Story of your Life""which i really want to read.<br/><br/>One advantage of the movie is that turns a classic plot,that aliens visit Earth with some huge vessels and then wait,into a story talking about humanity,love and mostly the meaning of language.<br/><br/>Amy Adams played her role in away so realistic that it may be sure that she will take the Oscar of best actress this year.Although Emma Stone and Natalie Portman will be surely nominees,Amy Adams was just perfect.Well,the truth is that she played a really interesting and clever character,Louise,who is a linguist who tries to talk with the creepy,strange aliens.She is a character that has a lot to share and with really important abilities that will help people to find a solution.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner,plays Ian,the scientist that helps Louise to solve the problem.Their relationship becomes really strong as we can observe that they come closer to each other and share their experiences.<br/><br/>I think that the movie is awesome due to one fact.It isn't like the other alien movies,that people need to survive for the aliens and fight them...but it provides to the audience a really strong meaning,the importance of language and how it connects us and changes us in a great way. Meanings.theories,ways of life,ways to look,to learn and to understand are hidden into words.<br/><br/>The movie contains an excellent twist that effects the whole movie and makes it even more complicated.I was also surprised by the design of the aliens,that have seven legs and write with a code of cyclical nature,instead of the typical structure of words an letters.<br/><br/>The ""flashbacks"" are excellent scenes among with the scene that Louise talks with the aliens in person and she finally understands why they came there.These scenes make the movie a film of high quality and beautiful cinematography!<br/><br/>All in all,Arrival is a movie talking about the borders not only between people but also between the pieces that build ourselves.With a perfect combination of science-fiction and drama,it is one of the best movies of the year.After Arrival I have really high expectations about Blade runner 2049 which will be also directed by DenisAnd,who knows,maybe these aliens arrive again...but this time their coming for the Oscars!Sorry,but I can'y say more.Because,very fittingly,I don't find the words in order to say more."
"Joe-146","9","6","15","20 November 2016"," Hollywood CAN make straight-up sci-fi!
","Most of the 'sci-fi' from big studios feels more like watching someone playing a video game, with maximum action per-frame. Not that there's anything wrong with that. To my mind, great sci-fi makes the viewer think about stuff they never considered. Or ponder mundane things in unimagined ways. I found Arrival immensely satisfying in the way my favorite sci-fi books did. Like Clarke's Childhood's End or Card's Ender series, the scope of the story continues to build - as do the repercussions. The story ends at a very different place ....or at least with the attentive viewer in a very different place than they were likely at when the movie began. I must say, the quiet yet unsettling way the film begins had me hooked from the start. I admit I had flashbacks to the chills I had on 9/11 when it finally hit me that 'everything has instantly changed in ways I couldn't imagine. What do I do now?' And I ended up going through the mundane motions trying to internally digest this profound and jarring paradigm shift. If you want an action flick like Independence Day or Armageddon, look elsewhere. If you want a film that stays with you and haunts you - like Children of Men... then maybe you'll like Arrival. Everyone in the cast and crew deserve every accolade and award they're nominated for. Above all, if this film isn't nominated for 'best adapted screenplay' there is no justice. I have not seen a film that lived up to my unrealistic anticipation in a long long time. Arrival is truly special and I hope becomes a classic of the sci-fi genre. It's too soon to tell, but I would not be surprised if it ends up at or near the top of most folks' top sci-fi films (or simply story) lists. Profound thanks to everyone who had a hand in making this haunting, eye- opening film."
"Icedooitle","9","6","15","14 November 2016"," Because of Kangaroo
","It is estimated that over 90% of communication is non-verbal. It is interesting to think that of the thousands of languages and tens of thousands of words we have, we're only marginally more sophisticated than Cro-Magnon-level pointing and grunting. When attempting to convey a thought, there are countless ways for things to get lost in translation. The new and thought provoking ""Arrival"" takes this notion and raises the stakes to such heights that a single word misunderstood could result in global catastrophe. As a dozen alien space-crafts emerge all over the globe, the threat is twofold; how do we accurately communicate with these extraterrestrial beings, and how do we trust the rest of the world's handling of these new visitors? <br/><br/>Sci-Fi has the potential to succeed in conjunction with any other genre. Action is easy, comedy is forgettable, drama is hit and miss, and melodrama is more miss than hit. It is therefore high praise that the guarded melodrama in ""Arrival"" functions successfully as it should, as a parable. The film starts with a fade-in accompanied by music that would be welcome in a Schindler's List montage. We see Louise (Amy Adams) in silhouette before we are thrown into a whirlwind of memories. Louise welcomes a baby girl, Hannah, into the world. In a matter of a few minutes Hannah is 4, then 8, then on her deathbed at 12. We accompany Louise after these events in a mental fog. She is a professor of speech and linguistics at a local University but she seems detached. Before we see her enter her classroom we hear the clapping of running feet to groups clustered around televisions. Murmurings suggest something big, but Louise is slave to routine and continues to her nearly empty classroom. When prompted to turn on the news, she gets her first glimpse of the alien spacecraft. The next day she goes to work to find not only an empty class, but vacant University.<br/><br/>Naturally, Louise is tapped by the government to communicate with the Montana based ship, and we begin to see the fear and immediacy employed by our own government. After the first meeting with these entities, it becomes apparent how quickly things could go wrong with even a minor slip of communication. As the fear rises, the faith in the rest of the world's competence plummets. The developments of Louise's crucial role in communicating with the aliens are something I can't spoil. The logic and brilliant examples used to guide us through this process is extraordinary.<br/><br/>The style of the aliens and their ships, however, is not the show stealer. The ships look somewhere between a Reese's peanut butter egg, and a rock for a hot-stone massage. The aliens themselves can best be described as a Harry Potter dementor, sitting atop a face- hugger from ""Alien,"" all wrapped in elephant skin. The words these visitors ""write"" look like a language based on forgetting to use a coaster on a coffee table. The purpose for the ""look"" of these aliens is not visual appeal, but to illustrate exactly how foreign this species is from human.<br/><br/>Performances by Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are an afterthought to the plot and protagonist. This is Louise's movie. Amy Adams has to play a role that juggles grief, fear, thrill, and urgency. This may sound like a heroine from many action films, but ""Arrival"" takes its time to allow us into her introspection. We feel her doubt and confusion as her perceptions of chronology and reality begin to make more and less sense simultaneously. A film that can feel this intimate on a global scale has to anchor itself on a relatable character. Her emotions are relatable, but her mind is leagues beyond. Half of what we understand, we get second-hand as she explains processes to other characters. The second half is much more profound. The endless possibilities that can be hypothesized and entertained make for a great exercise of the imagination. Just think how maddening it will be to successfully communicate these ideas to anyone else."

I kept waiting for the good parts, looked at the time, and realized it had been an hour. My mind started thinking about other things.<br/><br/>You'll have to think real hard to get the plot.

","Arrival is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Michael Stuhlbarg, Forest Whitaker, Mark O'Brien, Abigail Pniowsky, Tzi Ma, Jadyn Malone and Julia Scarlett Dan.<br/><br/>A linguist is recruited by the military to assist in translating alien communications.<br/><br/>With Sicario, Prisoners, Enemy and Incendies bringing his unique flair to the spotlight, Villeneuve takes on a new genre; Sci-Fi. This isn't your typical action-packed science fiction movie, this is an intelligent look at how we as human beings could interact with alien life.<br/><br/>Amy Adams delivers a refreshingly relatable and emotional performance, with great depth and charisma. Jeremy Renner stars alongside Adams, presenting a new side to his acting abilities which strays away from his action hero characteristic. As the story flows consistently, so does the editing. With 'dream-like' scenes being used thoughtfully throughout to aid Adams' performance and overall character arc. Joe Walker proved himself worthy when he worked with Villeneuve on Sicario, presenting his distinctive skill, and so he shines furthermore with Arrival.<br/><br/>The original score by Jóhann Jóhannsson is subtle in approach, yet intricate in detail. The introduction to the alien life-form is handled perfectly, using Jóhann's unique composition and eerie writing to punctuate the unusual entity. Having worked with Villeneuve before on Sicario and Prisoners, the familiarity is present, touching on the sparse and complex sound design that featured before. Highlighting the beautifully dark 'Heptapod B' which utilises unintelligible vocal lines, further exploring and expanding upon his talent. This sets Jóhannsson apart from all other film composers and has become one of the most influential people for me personally.<br/><br/>Something that's always been so wonderfully attached to Villeneuve's work is the cinematography, which in Arrival, is undeniably beautiful. The locations and landscapes are captured with absolute care and provide a remarkable canvas for the story to be told. The special and visual effects are also appreciable and showcase an unearthly visual design for the extraterrestrial beings. There's one shot that gave me a quick flashback to the final scene in Enemy, which I won't go into. Bradford Young encapsulates this skilfully.<br/><br/>The art direction, set decoration and production design is fluent and feels authentic. Everyone involved has done an incredible job to provide a genuine backdrop for Villeneuve and team to work in. I'd also like to share my appreciation for the sound department. Dave Whitehead, who has quite an impressive CV, has created an entangled and twisted language for the aliens, only to be experienced in theatres.<br/><br/>Verdict; Arrival is not an action-packed Independence Day. This is a carefully constructed and well-directed story that keeps you thinking way beyond the closing credits. Denis Villeneuve's winning streak lives on.<br/><br/>Arrival, 9/10."
"trevor-82944","8","6","15","11 November 2016"," Flips You Sideways in Knowing What Lies Beyond Us
","Immediately we are grabbed from our seats into the journey of Dr. Louise Banks and her discovery of what it means to be bound by time. Played vulnerably by five-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams (American Hustle, Doubt), Dr. Banks is weighed down in life by the loss of her daughter to cancer. While a sixth nomination for Adams is unlikely for this role, Arrival still gives a richly tense and starkly imaginative allegory to the coming end times, as paralleled by the inner demons of past trauma.<br/><br/>In her present state, she is a college professor of English. At one of her teaching sessions, the lecture hall is suspiciously low on students. There are alerts on their mobile devices about unidentified objects landing across the globe, each one shaped like a large perpendicular shell. This causes for mass evacuation away from these objects, with only authorized authorities supervising and investigating what they are and where they come from. At this point, it feels like a rip-off of classic alien invasion thrillers including Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Day the Earth Stood Still. While it certainly obeys the tropes for the most part, creative liberties are still taken to ensure an exhilarating experience.<br/><br/>Why did they land in these specific spots? That's the question the American government is trying to answer as they conduct an organized approach to interacting to whatever thrives inside these things. Their solution in interacting with this unknown is to bring in Dr. Banks to apply her English knowledge, a highly discomforting task for her, as well as the audience. The unpredictability and danger that she is thrown into hits you right where you feel, especially when it comes time to approach the inside of this vessel.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) proves yet again how much skill he has in disorienting you without having to manipulate the screen with IMAX magic, as his choices of framing gives an overwhelming feel of scale in comparison to this unidentified object. The color palette used by cinematographer Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year) gives a stark feel of loneliness in a world separated by language barriers. The stressful sound effects complement the sad melodic music scored by Jóhann Jóhannsson (Sicario, The Theory of Everything).<br/><br/>Inside of the object, the gravity is perpendicular to our own; then at the end of the object, these eerie, faceless, squid-like lifeforms behind a white veil await the approach of human investigators. Dr. Banks leads the interaction with these beings, later named ""Heptapods,"" who communicate through painting abstract black rings that make up their language. So she, as a college professor, applies her history in English to vigorously study their language, which they call ""nonlinear orthography."" The process in figuring out their form of communication is absolutely brilliant and inspirational in how it's created and discovered.<br/><br/>As real as this small-scale epic feels, its treatment towards the other countries is still rather problematic. Essentially, they are treated like outsiders from America whose first resort is to rage war against the unknown, unlike those in the richest country in the world who rely on communication past language barriers to solve problems. Based on what I've seen in the news recently, this is not how things have played out.<br/><br/>There's also an issue I have with the portrayal of Dr. Banks' daughter, who is absent for a large portion of the film as if she's not really that important to the story. If she were mentioned more consistently through the first and second acts, she would have strengthened the conflict between the key characters.<br/><br/>Yet the reminder of our relation with family issues and the passage of time may just as well be the push forward that we need to communicate with one another despite the inconvenience of language differences across barriers. It is through interaction and compromise that we will arrive at where we intend to go."

I know that we have a universe that gets bent, but it seems too much like a god machine to me.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","12","13 January 2017"," Ambiguity in communicating via language
","I would like to start with two very popular TV programs, both from half a century ago, that have some relevancy. Among the ""Alfred Hitchcock Present's"" episodes, the one with the wickedest twist on ambiguity of language would have to be this one, an aliens story quite similar to ""Arrival"", about a visit from mysterious alien ships. In that story, the aliens invite people into the ship for a tour. People's anxiety dissipates when they find a book of the aliens with the title deciphered to be ""To serve men"", which leads to the obvious conclusions that these aliens are benevolent. The wicked twist comes at the very end, when further analysis finally reveals the nature of this book. The three last words uttered by this scientist making the discovery are earth-shattering: It's a cookbook.<br/><br/>The other TV series is even mentioned in the movie, although indirectly: Abbot and Costello. This the name given by the scientist to the two alien creatures that they are attempting to communicate with. They seem quite random until it dawns on you that this is the team that brought to the entertainment world the most celebrated, hilarious ""Who's on first base"", a side-splitting comedy sketch based again on the ambiguity of language. <br/><br/>The movie itself is anything but comedy, opening with an essentially visual, brief narrative on the birth, growth and untimely death (lost to cancer as a teenager) of Dr Louise Banks's (Amy Adams) daughter. Then the movie kicks into action, although at a more languid pace than in other similar science fiction movies. Louisa, a language expert, together with Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), a scientist, is recruited by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to help out in solving communication problems with visiting aliens. <br/><br/>A dozen alien space vehicles have landed at different places in the world. They look like gigantic footballs standing on stands awaiting a kickoff, except that they are skinnier and in fact levitating. The aliens look like huge seven-legged squids. Human beings are allowed inside their spaceship and see them very much like behind the viewing glass in an aquarium. Various attempts of establishing communication culminate in a measure of success being achieved through using their language that look like round coffee stains left on a coaster. <br/><br/>What we witness happening in Montana is also happening at the other eleven locations with different nations that include the world's two other top powers. Predictably, political tension comes into play as some players are running out of patience and contemplate initiating hostile action. <br/><br/>The factual account above, I realize, is not too helpful on elaborating the philosophical nature of this unique science fiction that critics widely praise. With the intriguing theme of inter-species communication and Louisa's grief hovering in the background, among other themes (such as the meaning of time), ""Arrival"" clearly has more depth than ""Gravity"" with a single-agenda of will to survive. <br/><br/>This is Amy Adams's showpiece. With her easy, disarming charm, Adams has gained immense popularity. But in the proliferation of her work, she has never tackled a character like Louisa, with her silence doing more talking than her dialogue. You wold think that this would be a job for Jody Foster or Kate Winslet. But Adams is convincing that these two could not have done better than she did in ""Arrival"". Isabelle Huppert won Golden Globe and Natalie Portman Critics' Choice. But Adams is nominated also for BAFTA and Screen Actors Guild. I would be very surprised if she does not also get nominated for Oscar. Let's wait and see."

There is some off-screen violence, but that's hinted at, rather than actually shown. There are some fantastical technological wonders on the alien ships, like their artificial gravity, and the aliens' smoke-based writing system. The aliens in the movie, called the Heptapods, were created based on biological influences on Earth, they look familiar and alien at the same time. They look kind of like octopuses or even the human hand.<br/><br/>In some ways, this movie is familiar, it's similar to Close Encounters of Third Kind, or Childhood's End. It's even slightly similar to Independence Day, but several levels smarter. Another interesting feature of this movie is that it was told non-linearly, which we don't find out about till the end, that a lot of the stuff that we saw happening actually didn't happen till the future.<br/><br/>Overall a very intelligent movie, but if you're going in to see a typical space shoot-em-up, this isn't the movie for you.

","The new Sci-Fi effort, ""Arrival"", isn't exactly a new idea. Going back to ""2001-A Space Odyssey"", and most recently ""Midnight Special"", stories about communicating with aliens haven't lacked for examination. In this piece, aliens arrive at various sites around the globe, and (surprise!) they don't have any known language. Amy Adams, as a renowned linguistic prof, is recruited to communicate with them. She is in a race with other ""communicators"" to find out why the aliens have shown up; the various governments aren't good at cooperating. No spoilers there. To my only very basic linguistic-trained experience, the linguistics in this instance are spot on. The science seems at least a bit shaky. The fantasy... well, it's waaay out there. In spite of all that, thanks to Amy Adams, the film does work on a storytelling level. Her character uses linguistics, along with her partner (played by Jeremy Renner), a mathematician, to decode the aliens' language. The task is time-consuming, and of course belligerents around the world get impatient. Can she beat the clock? That is her assignment, and she knows it from the very beginning. Adams, as always, is terrific. (Like Jennifer Lawrence, there doesn't seem to be any role Adams can't bring off.) Renner's subtle but positive influence is significant. He doesn't have a lot to do, but he makes good use of his assignment. Forest Whittaker, as the sympatico but hard-pressed military commander, is good but forgettable. Without Adams, there would be no film. Director Denis Villaneuve realizes this and makes good use of her. He would have been well assisted with a more cohesive script."

"pipecax","9","4","9","29 May 2017"," Undamaged & Superb Insurrection For Hollywood Science Fiction
","The vastness of human pragmatism that science fiction can encompass is unheard-of. It's been circumscribed erroneously with the epigraph about the impossibility of its acts, it's paradoxical to look back and itemize any minutia of our history emerged with a ""that never will happen"" or a ""this is impossible"". And here we're, where was such a the conception of logic and fairness when a group of German Jews and Aryan citizens decided by 44% of utilitarian votes that a midget beast to head up Germany and the selfsame world into a cyclone of blood to the unforgiving netherworld? Or, where was equal, liberating and fair American people who asserted equality and pluralism when they elected a Republican Presbyterian with a citrus wig to lead the crux of the universe?, There is where the literary and film well-known adage glow to its highest expression: ""reality surpasses fiction"". Although modern events are or were influenced by constraint, opinion disparities, ambition or vileness, the other piece has invested us partially as equality organisms in terms of race and eliminator of misogyny. We've got over cataclysms, world wars or an everyday interpersonal uproar, we've interred pride and unified us as human beings in a universal manner; at present, we shouldn't look beyond the stars, we have to plan to get beyond them.<br/><br/>Sci-fi genre takes the Maremagnum of a discipline to the extreme in a context in which there may be a high, medium, or minimum probability nature, having the chance to provide certain bi-dimensional items to the work called fiction. It can either derail astray by slated and mostly deficient burial of science opportunities and overflowing imagination until the chimeric (""Star Wars"" & ""Star Trek""), or otherwise, it can avail itself a global thesis supported by foundations with scientific sustenances to a greater or lesser extent, relegating the creative freedom. Big exponents have sprung up in recent decades since Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg gave terror and erudition in the obligatory sci-fi classics of the past (""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Alien"").<br/><br/>As its title suggests, the plot revolves around the unplanned landing of twelve alien spaceships, which are likened the 2001 monolith of ""A Space Odyssey""; spectral figures, extraterrestrial resources, those who have arrived with own aim. The ship in which the story focus is one that touched down a few meters away from the greenish surface of Montana, USA. It's so like the American people to first examine and then proceed, using the head rather than the force; thus the US government decides to hire seasoned in dead and alive languages, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) in order to investigate succinct stimulus of its visit. However, they stumble on more unknowns than elucidations due to the harsh context where they're. May do ""they"" use some kind of informational exchange? How will ""they"" discern what they want to express? May do ""they"" grasp human reasoning? It's right here where previously treated space-time works, blended with a linguistic atmosphere which portrayed, in the background, paranoia, and informality of human reaction facing a critical contingency. We're involved in Louise's circumstances, but suddenly, we may feel reflected as in her indigo eyes as in Ian's or anyone's eyes who may be experiencing such an event; the film is about finding a ""why"" about ourselves, not about them. Will we be the threat?<br/><br/>""I don't believe in starts or finals"", with this direct thought in voice-over is shaped in front of us a so-called muddled narration; the confidences were within our reach, however, the only thing we did was continue to attest the shortcomings of our language, cemented in times as yesterday, today and tomorrow. Everything makes sense with the concluding scenes of diegetic meaning, clearing up the general purpose of its arrival, donating a gift as harmful as utilitarian for a society who is at Apocalypse's edge. In that moment, we noticed that in the same way she did in ""Nocturnal Animals"", Adams has teased our intellectual coefficient, has attained that we continue under a spell the MacGuffin for, in the last snap, reveal us that was something more intimate, something about you and I that exceeds the rational, something more complex that one invasion; It's a musing about humanity breaks points, and that actually, is the role of Villeneuve's fiction: elucidating by its semiological proposal, the flaws of communication and understanding of the human race, our contraction against fate, our damaged governmental organization, our lack of sensitivity; We're human because someone gives us such seal, but in the cruelest truth, we're primitive societies adorned as organized.<br/><br/>A calm pace, measured action, and limited literal entertainment; they want we read about above-mentioned by the language of the celluloid in a noticeable way, it's said that ""reading is work"", the speaker sets a code to which the speaker and receiver assign it the same meaning, there's no a common code, the listener shall decipher the code of the way in which the statement reveals it. They don't want you go to see a film, they demand you watch a reality.<br/><br/>An experience that must be pressing for that sci-fi fan who based its passion for rational causes and effects, besides, it ratifies Amy Adams' overwhelming acting ability and thrives on the potential of its director and team resulting in a work worthy of being appended beyond fiction stories, where's the raw essence of cinema. A story glides through few settings with meager lighting, giving priority to the language and the context, discarding dispensable technical terms and CGI sequences to reveal caustically in the last five minutes that nothing has a start and a terminal; paraphrases aren't always put on the table. Why are they here? The gift bequeathed to us was a simple tool, which serves as a duct to carry out sublimely moral, emotional, political, human, philosophical and, at the last stay, cinematographic choices."
"dmc101","6","4","9","14 March 2017"," Interesting Twist to Old Story
","First let me comment on this review board in that so many reviews are all or nothing. Reviews should be somewhere between 1 and 10, not 1 or 10. You can basically discount 1 or 2, and 9 or 10 as just people enamored or disappointed with the film.<br/><br/>With that said, I gave it the 6 because the story was a hazy hodgepodge of M Night Shyamalan proportions. If you are expecting a sci-fi thriller look elsewhere, but if you're expecting an old, well worn story of.. well I don't even know what it's really saying to be quite honest. In one scene the story seems to be that she is remembering her daughter yet in another she is back in the present. Only later to you learn that she has the ability to see the future, so she never really had a daughter but she knows she will, that the little girl will have an incurable disease and from there the decision she has to make is whether or not to have the child anyhow. Since she remembers it, it stands to reason that she did have the child, only in the future, if that makes any sense. I suppose her memory isn't as much a memory as a view into the future, and at one point she learns to actually realize when she's there vs in our present time. <br/><br/>Now for the aliens and the soldiers and such: What? These could have been anything it made no sense to have things that couldn't communicate. For something with a universal language, why couldn't they communicate with humans? If these things were from the future, they already know they came there and should be able to do what she did, which was to lean on those precognition as a learning/manipulation tool. That's just one hole in many in this movie. The soldiers were a hoot! Half of them walking around outdoors without their covers (hats) with the big brass all over, seemingly unconcerned as long as a couple of them wore battle gear (for what?) while the rest were in standard issue uniforms. I also found it interesting that the trucks were washed down as if the unmeasured radiation could be washed off, or that some foreign bacteria might eat everyone alive.<br/><br/>Now on to the plot: If aliens who had that technology wanted to kill you, would they wait months while you talked with them before doing so? What, are they going to beat you at Scrabble? Why is it always some other country that's eager to go to war instead of the USA? Isn't the USA the country that's almost always at war somewhere in the world? But no, Russia and China ready to do battle because if China says so, Russia is on board, and never mind they killed their linguist because that's what Russia would do. <br/><br/>Just what the world needs, a universal language so we can all hate each other openly. But somehow it brought all the countries together albeit still proud of their own individual national flags. Generals and high ranking colonels shoot first, ask questions later however for some reason the military was the ones who decided to attempt to communicate. Who was the 1st person to go up into that open hole? Did they go without weapons? Why? Why even go up into it in the first place? Why not sent a drone? Don't you just love movies that use deus ex machina to get across these gaps in reality?<br/><br/>Overall the movie was entertaining, but poorly done and it's really really easy to dismiss it as a chick flick, since most of the ""science"" was hogwash."
"georgidianov","6","4","9","6 March 2017"," It is not about the destination; it is all about the journey
","Enemy (2013) and Prisoners (2013) merge and become Arrival (2016); a movie with continuous flashbacks and flashforwards - the main trouble with the pace and timing in this film.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve, the 'Mystery-Drama-Man', is stimulating us to think that the journey (our life) is far worthier than the final destination (death). And this is something that can be understood thanks to Louise, because it is her who embraces life after suffering all losses in her past, and the events that will happen in her future. This is why she offers to the observers the thoughtful question of: ""if you could view your life as an image, a story told in one nonlinear and infinite symbol, would you change it?"" <br/><br/>But be careful, because the director makes us think that Louise is remembering her past when she could be actually seeing glimpses of her future! What is more, the movie is so slow that one could fall asleep four or five times during the movie! In here, everything happens every 15 minutes than the linear films we are accustomed to watch. This is why Arrival is not better than neither Prisoners nor Enemy. At least, in both movies from 2013 follow a linear path with a mysterious end, whereas in here the inexplicableness is not around the heptapods but Louise's visions.<br/><br/>Despite this, it should be pointed out that there is no better choice for Louise Banks' role than Amy Adams. She is just brilliant. Every single move, word and look is just outstanding. And that is what the movie is about. The movie is all about Louise and the interactions in her mind, with her friends and between the 'aliens heptapods'.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the problem is presented in front of us and it is something like ""imagine that there are 12 alien ships which have just arrived and positioned themselves around the globe - what would you do?"" Well, if the word was given to the Chinese General Shang, he would probably destroy humanity. But let us not forget that ""in war there are no winners, only widows"". Why do we have to fight? Let us learn the language of these aliens, teach them our language or let us do both things. Let us think about the consequences! Some of them could be changed. Others, like Louise's case, could be foreseen, and although Hannah's future will be dreadful, it might be worth to enjoy her a little bit.<br/><br/>In a nutshell - the idea of the movie is excellent. It touches both reality and fantasy. The timing and pace were the only issue to convert this movie into Best Motion Picture of the Year at the awful Academy Awards given to the Moonlight-Disaster."

Why? **SPOILER** First, there is this ARRIVAL of the aliens and Louise Banks was one of the best translator or whatever they need. Then so many thing happens like there is first you think it's flashback but it's not I will tell that later. The mystery here is what is that flashback, who is the father the daughter(Hannah) saying. But even it's not the end, I could tell it's Ian Donnelly so that breaks the mystery(- points there). The butterfly effect doesn't apply :), how the hell she knows what to say to General Shang if she doesn't know it after all. She just gain the information after going to the future. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN IF SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY? Then the mystery of there is Daughter that first you think it's flashback that was later it was the future that she was seeing that was not necessary need to be hidden all the time if the mystery was who is the father? And there are questions un-answered, why the alien visits the earth if they just want to tell that Louise has the gift or whatever, seriously? And Forest Whitaker as cast is a bait!!!!"
"PeaceGuard","7","4","9","5 February 2017"," Reflection inducing, but screenplay and science are weak.
","Checking first 4 or 5 pages with reviews I've only found ones with a rating of 9 or 10 and 5 or below. That's ambivalent..<br/><br/>I've rated the movie with a 7, because of it's reflection inducing values, very nice special effects, not bad music and acting. But the screenplay and directing are this movies weak sides. The scriptwriter is supposed to make sure everything makes sense, is reliable, logical and error free. A director is responsible for controlling all of that and suggesting some changes for the better, but they both failed completely.<br/><br/>The first problem is the incoherence between the suggested high level of intelligence and development of the alien race and what we see in the script. The aliens arrive, but they're like children - unprepared, not knowing what to do, not knowing how to communicate, with no initiative. Humans which are supposed to be a less developed race have to teach them communication, just like dealing with some autistic children. Of course it even takes time before they start to understand the difference between ""human"" and an individual name.<br/><br/>From the other side we have humans which choose just two people - one quite random scientist, who's in the middle of his 40s instead of some experienced expert and one linguist. No one else is needed. Well, they theoretically have some ""teams"", but obviously these teams don't do anything at all. And this best linguist also doesn't know how to start a conversation. She even teaches in school, but she can't figure out that it might be a good idea to for example link images with words to teach these aliens instead of writing them words and trying to explain what you mean by chaotic other words and gestures. It's good these aliens are at least available to see, which really isn't that obvious.<br/><br/>The aliens can open the hatch only once per 18 hours even though they possess an advanced technology and it seems the area where they stand is sealed, so there's no real reason for this interval.<br/><br/>The aliens have chosen to land on 12 different locations even though their aim was to simply transfer their language thus allowing humans (or some of them) to perceive time differently which is supposed to help them and earn their help in the future, but hey.. why did they needed to land on these 12 locations instead of one? There's no answer for this. The same as why can't they help themselves if they have 3 thousand years for that? Are humans more capable of developing some helping skills during this time than they are? Doesn't seem to have sense.<br/><br/>Then we have the political motive. We can see China and Russia as these primitives who can't be patient enough to conduct any peace talks, but want to use force since practically the beginning. And I could even agree with that a bit, because in general the more liberal and democratic a society is, the more likely it is to use peaceful and rational approach and the more autocratic and conservative a society is the more likely it is to use violence and coercion to solve it's problems. But still it's quite ""propagandish"".<br/><br/>And they don't even have the The whole parenthood motive is very weak and seems to be added just for inducing people's emotions and thus making the movie's rating better. And does this scientist guy really seem like a person who abandons his family ""only"" because he knows that his daughter will die in the future?<br/><br/>But the worst of all is this destiny motive. The movie clearly indicated that you cannot change your future, regardless of whether you know it or not. Destiny can be somewhat understood as long as you don't assume you know your future, because hey.. from the future perspective everything you've done in your past could only go one way. Life is not a PC game, where you can make a save, then try out a couple of future outcomes and go on with the most preferred. But it gets complicated once you assume you know the future. The theory that you would still be incapable of changing it is one of the most laughable science assumptions. The aliens can't prevent their future problems, the min character can't choose to have a healthy child by prenatal diagnosis.. hell, these highly developed aliens don't even have a prescription for cell regeneration (and thus preventing aging and most of the diseases) even though scientists all agree that it should easily be achievable to crack it before one millennium, maybe in few centuries. If it's written in their bubble-language that ten years from now you will choose to go right at the crossroads, you'll have to go right even if you'll know it and you'd prefer to go left. It reduces life to a massive puppet show.<br/><br/>Okay, there was more I noticed during the watching session, but now it's all I remember. It's definitely very far away from a ""sci-fi masterpiece"" some call it (I really pity for their lack of analytical thinking and scientific knowledge), but from the other side it's not as bad as some no-life haters say and it should be able to induce some more thoughts than usual in most of the viewers, which is good."
"mr-shcmr","4","4","9","30 January 2017"," Meditative alien encounter movie reminiscent of Contact.
","It seems that a lot of the complaints come from people who expected an action movie. But not every alien movie has to be that ! So if you like the other kind, slow paced, low-key, intellectual... then go watch Contact.<br/><br/>Arrival draws a lot from Contact : themes, pace, plot elements. Both are stories where the big alien encounter mostly serves as a device to explore the psyche and emotions of a single human : the female lead role.<br/><br/>At times, Contact managed to make you ponder about science and faith. In the end, Arrival, with more sets and more CGI, and a gripping dark atmosphere, will mostly make you think about its plot holes and shortcuts."
"Windy_Dave","5","4","9","3 January 2017"," Am I the only person who found this movie confusing?
","I found this movie confusing, and that spoiled it. From the beginning I presumed that all the main character's vivid memories of a daughter who eventually dies as images of the past. Rather like the main character in Gravity, a woman psychologically hobbled by the loss of a young daughter. When I left the theatre, I was still not sure if what the clues I saw in the movie were telling me were what the filmmaker wanted me to take away. Many people have said they found this movie human, emotional and moving. Was all it was trying to tell me that the aliens' gift to some people was to see their future? This confusion spoiled the movie for me. Too bad, as acting performances were very good, and technically the movie was very good."
"jediknight190501","8","4","9","25 December 2016"," The Aliens Are Here. Now what?
","Thought provoking? Certainly. Deliberately paced and quiet in its intensity? Absolutely. In the end, though, ""Arrival"" is about perception. How we relate to the reality around us, and how we interact with others is defined by our view of existence. Perception is the foundation upon which communication rests. We cannot understand someone else when their perspective is foreign to us. For example, I'm an American. When I talk about aspects of our society that are uniquely ours, those with no experience with those aspects simply won't understand what is really meant if I say that ""Dave stole 2nd base."" A person with no exposure to the sport of baseball would think that Dave was a thief. Imagine, then, how would we learn to communicate with extra terrestrial beings who have absolutely no relationships with those things that are a part of the human experience? How to work around the differences in perception between homo sapiens and none terrestrial alien visitors lies at the heart of ""Arrival.""<br/><br/>In the film, Amy Adams stars in the role of a world class linguist, Dr. Louise Banks. Jeremy Renner co-stars as physicist Dr. Ian Donnely. The two are tasked by the military to figure out how to communicate with aliens who've come to Earth, specifically to Montana and 11 other locations around the globe. All the countries where the aliens have appeared work simultaneously to decipher the alien language, but it is Dr. Banks who makes the most progress as the film moves along. I don't want to say anything more about the plot of the film, as to do so would give away those things that should come as a surprise to viewers.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve, who also directed the 2015 film ""Sicarro"" among others. Besides Adams and Renner, other featured players in the film include Forest Whitaker (as Colonel Weber) and Tzi Ma (as Chinese general Shang). ""Arrival"" is based on a short literary work by Ted Chiang called ""Story of Your Life"". I have not read the story so cannot compare it with film.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" is one of those movies that asks questions that apply not only to what would really happen if aliens came here, but how such a visitation might actually change the world in a remarkable and profound manner. In ""Arrival,"" though, there are more questions than answers. The reason for that is to make sure the audience tries to answer those questions for themselves. It is only through our own reflection that we truly find any answers that have meaning, after all."
"gtaguy","8","4","9","4 December 2016"," its a buffet!! pick what you like.
","Not everyone grabs the same meal at a buffet. Arrival seems to fit this very same mold. Arrival is not just a movie to sit back and enjoy . It was more a movie that will make you explore your mind, Plays on your emotions and plays tricks with your head. Asks the questions yet gives you answers. This movie was not meant to be an ""Independence Day"" i get that. Arrival offers a style of movie that is gonna tap into your inner thoughts and feelings. If you lost a loved one it tugs at your heart and will make you emotional. Knows how far to go while yet giving the movie the objective it strived for. Shows humanity at its most desperate state and gives a visual of how we could possibly respond. A visual of humanity at its most irrational state of being. Gives ideas that we as humans don't work together and to unite us might just be impossible. not even an Alien invasion might do it. I see this movie as being one that asks you about your own existence and your place in this small world. Asks if we as one dominant species will ever leave our differences behind and trust each other for the sake of this world we live in. Communication is key. On the other hand there were parts that even i don't quite grasp but have to learn to believe that if life apart from our blue planet exists then we must throw out our concepts of rationalism and that anything is possible. Not a blockbuster movie in any way but definitely a movie that will make you think and appreciate. It's thought provoking and tells a story of what might be. There is still hope and if humans wanna survive we better get our acts together"
"Anurag-Shetty","9","4","9","29 November 2016"," The most unique sci-fi movie ever made.
","Arrival is based on the short story, Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang. When alien spaceships land on Earth, expert linguist Louise Banks(Amy Adams) is hired by the army. Louise is given the job of translating the alien communications. Louise is part of a team that also includes theoretical physicist, Ian Donnelly(Jeremy Renner). Together, they have to decipher the language of the aliens & find out what they are doing on Earth. <br/><br/>Arrival is a mind blowing film. Director Denis Villeneuve has directed yet another masterpiece after, Prisoners(2013) & Sicario(2015). The best part about this movie is that, it is nothing like the usual alien flicks. There are no over-the-top action set pieces & the suspense is brilliantly maintained, throughout the film. The climax of the movie, will leave you speechless. The script by Eric Heisserer, based on Ted Chiang's source material, is fantastic. Pay close attention throughout the film, in case you miss any minute detail. The visual effects are subtle & perfect for a sci-fi movie, like Arrival. The haunting background score by Johann Johannsson is great. The cinematography by Bradford Young is gorgeous. Amy Adams' performance as Louise Banks, is the highlight of the film. Adams portrays a gamut of emotions throughout the movie, spectacularly. Jeremy Renner is superb as Ian Donnelly. Forest Whitaker is effective as Colonel Weber. Michael Stuhlbarg, Tzi Ma & Mark O'Brien are impressive as Agent Halpern, General Shang & Captain Marks, respectively. Jadyn Malone, Abigail Pniowsky & Julia Scarlett Dan are amazing as Hannah(6 years old), Hannah(8 years old) & Hannah(12 years old), respectively. Arrival is a must watch for everyone."

She may still-- labeled in prediction articles ""Who will win vs. Who Should win"". Not that there is anything wrong with her performance, there just wasn't much to it.<br/><br/>The opening sequence was on the ""Up"" variety, but didn't quite make it--I wanted to like her, root for her, sympathize, but like the house in which she lives, just left me stone cold and grey--much like November weather.<br/><br/>About 1/3 through I realized that this was probably not exactly what the viewer is supposed to think it is, and so I paid attention to clues throughout (the canary, the 'scientific' phrase, the ""Mommy and Daddy show""). A line towards the end was thrown in to (supposedly) throw the viewer off the trail ""My husband left me"", but failed at convincing me to rethink my suspicions.<br/><br/>So, as with ""The 6th Sense"", my gut was right.

","I think the good cast and excessive budget has blinded a lot of people to the empty plot and dialogue. The presentation of the global response is ridiculous (China is a military dictatorship and the rest of the world is irrelevant with Russia being just more China.) The characters were as deep as kiddy pools. There was no basis for the actions which developed the plot (e.g the armed rebellion and bombing on the base which was excused with a single line from the doctor) Smarmy comments like the Sanskrit war verse and the Kangaroo line show that the researchers talked to one and no more than one actual linguist. This is not a sci-fi film because the connection between language and time manipulation is the opposite of scienctifically valid.

The scenes showing the child made little sense, ie. how is this related to the aliens? ---but the background main storyline wasn't really too affected by it. When I went back and saw it again though, it all snapped into focus! The aliens had an almost extra dimensional understanding of time and several mentions were made about language having a profound effect on our world view. When the main character learns the language, she begins to see events and time in a completely different way. For example, it can be said that humans see time as a linear construct; time is a book that we can see only one page at a time. The heptapods taught her to see the entire story all at once. Every scene and all the dialogue pointed to this, but it was obscured by our limited understanding of higher dimensional concepts. Pretty cool way to introduce another way of thinking about cinematic possibilities."

","One of the most breathtaking science-fiction genres that I have watched by now. Due to an obscure story, it cannot be a satisfactory scenario for some of them. Even if the plot of the movie looks a little intricate, it has a gripping theme and having a good fiction. In fact, the intention is also scrutinized by other researchers and analysts about the arrival of alien, a painstaking examination and broadening the insights of the people and helping them uncover the esoteric facts about the purpose.
Moreover, it was the movie drawing the attention with its gloomy atmosphere, protecting its mystery till the end. It is definitely the distinguished masterwork of Denis Villeneuve. He knows how to shoot science fiction and mystery sorts, having plenty of competencies and skills concerning the production of science-fiction. It deserves the accolades which were received by makers."

The music score and bloody hell the hero of the movie was the cinematography. There were few shots in the movie which left you awestruck. Especially the first instance we see the alien ship, the shot of the Chinook, with the ship, the fog/cloud flowing down the mountains.

","""If you could see your whole life from start to finish... would you change things?""
Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is both a beautiful representation of how far the sci-fi genre has come since the early days, and a conscious and uniquely challenging glimpse at what it truly means to appreciate and respect the values of a life- YOUR life- and what it's all worth living for. I had heard about the movie from several people who urged me to see it simply because ""they knew I would be into it."" From what I could see, it was a mysteriously coded and detailed glimpse into what actual alien contact would be like, how the world at large would perceive it, and how far would we go to be able to understand them and get a sense of what exactly they were here on Earth to do. What I didn't realize is that those things were not actually the true core of the film; what I didn't realize until much much later into the film, is that Arrival is secretly more of a story about humanity than any incomprehensible alien life form. 
What do I mean by this? Well, in observing how the humans in the film deal with various issues brought up in the movie, we begin to examine humanity's faults much more than we do the aliens. These creatures are literally unknowable; the humans don't know anything about them, they can't communicate with them, they have no idea of their intentions. It's up to Amy Adams (in one of her most daring performances yet as Louise) to translate the alien's weird cryptic language and come up with a way to achieve an understanding of how they think so that their purpose can be defined. 
The film delves heavily into the ""Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis,"" or the theory that the structure of a language determines or greatly influences thoughts and characteristics of the culture in which it is spoken, to show that by understanding the language of these immense and complex alien creatures, Louise begins to think like them; she sees what they see, and it turns out that they perceive things in a much different way from how we do, literally having thoughts that exist outside the boundaries of time. In most films that deal with an alien threat through extermination or infiltration, this film is more about connection through language (An extremely relevant topic) and how sometimes things just can't be comprehended, only experienced.
There is a huge twist in this film that talking about would be a disservice to a person's first view of it. I will only say that it is one of the true mind blowing realizations of modern cinema (M Night Shyamalan be damned) and it forces you to rethink EVERYTHING you just watched in the film from start to finish. Arrival is genuinely complex, not in a hipster ""too cool for mainstream"" way or a ""rage against the machine"" way, but SERIOUSLY gets you thinking and wondering how all of this fits together. Ultimately, it asks the question of whether or not it's worth it to give your own life meaning, and what you might choose to do if you realized that many things were in fact meaningless.
Arrival is a film that I recommend you watch by yourself. Yes, it is a film that you might need to have some time to think about afterwards. I only wish to say that I highly recommend Arrival to the questioning mind, to the science fiction enthusiast who cares less about lore and solving every riddle and more about simply enjoying the moments that are being presented to them. 
I am one of those people, and I loved Arrival simply for the experience. It's truly a masterful story that fits together just the right elements of creepy, unsettling, heartfelt, madness and emotion enough to feel very satisfying."
"purrlgurrl","9","3","6","20 July 2018"," Not really science fiction . . .
","But rather, a meditation on communication - how language divides as well as unites us, and how it can shape our perception of time and reality. The film also leaves us with a question for ourselves, would we choose to forego the joy of an experience if we knew for certain ahead of time that it would end in great pain. <br/><br/>Early in the film, a linguist played by Amy Adams, writes on a white board the sentence, ""What is your purpose for coming here?"" And then proceeds to explain why even such a simple question can't be can't be posed to newly arrived heptapod aliens, who's verbal language sounds a bit like whale song.<br/><br/>Unlike any other film I can remember that deals with humans first encountering intelligent extraterrestrials, it presents what would likely be the most realistic scenario for such an event - that is, being aliens to each other the gap between us that we'd need to bridge to establish any communication would be enormous. First, we would need to teach each other how to ""speak"".<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Adams' character experiences what we at first believe are flashbacks about a daughter she lost at a young age to a genetic disease. However, we eventually learn they are flash forwards, since as she begins to learn the alien language (which is based on a non-linear concept of time) she begins to think as they do, becoming a cognitive time traveler who can see the future and the past. The child we at first think she remembers losing, she will choose to have in the future.<br/><br/>The film unfolds like a dream and its visuals have a dreamlike quality with very little nuts and bolts technology to be seen. These aliens seem almost beyond technology, except they they're housed in vessels (are they really space ships?) that provide a livable environment for them on Earth. When they leave, their vessels simply dissolve into mist."

","The movie is okay, but if you are not merely intellectual (and I am a total mind person and yet) you will be bored and disappointed. It sure does have nice moments, but you miss a little bit of action as well as: even if you just watch it for the idea: the main question is not really treated and neither is the moral (or as I think amoral) impact that goes with it - it is not just about Amy Adams' character, there are other people involved, and if this is her decision, it is a selfish one. and talking about selfishness: Whether it was Chiang's or Villeneuves decision to, once again, bash and defame and demonize the Germans: you are the ones who should take a history book, to quote your script, since there has never been such an incident in Rwanda - just new propaganda lies to hurt and torture an entire nation. Hollywood should start paying Germany, since without the Germans to bully, the lazy, uncreative, hostile bastards would not have any story lines anymore. If you urgently need material, you should write about the crimes of US American soldiers during/towards the end of WW2, not to mention the (superfluous) bombs of the allies (France, UK, USA) on civilians at the end of the war (when pretty much everything was over) which killed millions of innocents (and destroyed historical cultural sites) in Dresden and Wuerzburg etc etc. - and which still have to be removed weekly more than 70 years after. In so many ways you are just evil and wrong, torturing innocent, non-involved people for cheap thrills/making money/covering your creative shortcomings instead of looking at your own sins. You should be ashamed."

"smanteufel","6","3","6","30 March 2017"," Amicable and thought provoking yet ultimately negligible
","Dennis Villeneuve's newest picture Arrival has been advertised and for the most part received by audiences as an original and thought provoking sci-fi akin to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Interstellar, but I have to say after watching it I feel slightly underwhelmed by the work of a director who to date has never made a film short of brilliant.<br/><br/>Arrival begins with a dozen UFO's 'arriving' on Earth at various locations. Your typical science fiction tropes are all present, with a seemingly mundane day interrupted by potential chaos as Louise Banks (Amy Adams) a college professor in linguistics suddenly becomes a sought after commodity by US intelligence in order to decipher an alien language. Together with Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), she eventually learns the alien language enabling her to perceive time in cyclical fashion due to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. This of course is the first misinterpretation of scientific theory within the film, as the real theory: even being mentioned in the film as a debunked concept, is dependent upon an initial language perception, for example a natural speaking English person will not learn French and suddenly have a theoretical/ mental capacity on equal terms with a natural speaking national. The initial perception garnered by the first language absorbed generates an individual's perception. So it seems implausible that her perception of inter- dimensional time could be altered so drastically, if at all. <br/><br/>Which brings me to my second point, in that her new language is incomprehensible, and I don't mean in the general way that anything above the third dimension is incomprehensible, but in a way that is contradictory to theory cited within the story itself. Through learning the aliens written language, Louise is imbued with this new inter-dimensional vernacular enabling her to observe time from beginning to end instantly and freely as she congruently experiences her entire life at any given time as if she has done it before; because in effect, she has. The film shows and infers multiple instances with juxtaposing scenarios of happiness and sadness, with the prime example obviously being the birth and death of her daughter. This consequence of her power is portrayed in the film as a sort of Amor Fati (love of fate) or as Nietzsche conceptualised, an 'eternal recurrence' where one simply accepts their fate through contentment. But this theory is ultimately flawed within the context of this film and in turn with the structure of this films 'bootstrap paradox' narrative, instead choosing to portray Louise as a sort of Deus Ex Machina/ McGuffin who conveniently learns of things she has already done within cyclical time the very instant it becomes relevant to the linear dimension. There are multiple instances of the plot moving forward due to Louise's perception of the 'future'; for example, her phone call to General Shang was only able to occur because it had already occurred in the future, creating a causality loop where one action is dependent upon another in order to fulfil itself. Putting aside the fact that she seems unsure of herself at the time of the phone call, receiving her 'vision' of a conversation with the General in real-time suggests that her perception of time was still in fact linear, when if she was indeed able to perceive time in omnipotent fashion she would not have been so confused by any scenario having already experienced it retroactively. The mere presence of a causality loop denotes another scientific theory touched on in the film called Fermat's principle, where a ray of light will always transverse a distance that consumes the least amount of time irrespective of distance and refraction. The significance of this principle infers that in order for the light to take the least amount of time, it theoretically must 'know' how long each possible angle will take to transverse, in effect, knowing the future. This indicates that the path is set, and therefore predetermined. The consequences of this outcome with relation to Louise perceiving time in totality, essentially means that she has no free-will. If she has already experienced all of her time simultaneously, then she inevitably must fulfil what she has done in cyclical time in linear function as well. Therefore even if she does not occupy time in linear fashion, she still interacts within the third dimension linearly resulting in the fulfilment of the 'future' being enacted just as she had initially seen it.<br/><br/>Arrival does showcase great acting and traditional sci-fi elements throughout, but the overall rhetoric within the film, presaging an absolute need for open and honest communication across linguistic barriers is a nice sentiment, but ultimately negligible. The film finishes with a touching sequence of memories flooding through Louise's head of both past and future as she is presented with a cross roads; does she divert from this presented future and into the unknown? Or does she engage in a relationship with Ian Donnelly that will result in her future occurring the same way despite this realities afflictions, because it has moments of true beauty; is it no worth it? The trouble is she never had any choice to begin with as Villeneuve has compromised real scientific reasoning and logic in order to facilitate 'Hollywood' moments of tension and climax which contradict an abstraction of time that lends itself to omnipotence.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Arrival. It might not seem like it after reading this review, but it did have moments of excellence; and Dennis Villeneuve's style, although not quite as dark and gritty as in previous films the likes of Enemy or Prisoners, is still evident and as always striking. The main pitfalls of this film lie in its execution of narrative, which contradicts its implied meaning with its factual telling resulting in an ultimately frugal piece that although thought provoking, is just kind of a mess."

So with a little high expectations i must say, i go forward and watch the movie. And so on it is great! Sci-fi elements are great, drama is there, mystery too! The plot is developing real good and we sit and wait for a good conclusion. And that's when it hits you. All the thriller, drama, mystery, intrigue, all the plot that movie developed, is KICKED ASIDE and movie goes straight-titanic. Yup. There is one sentence that Dr. Ian says that literally ***** on sci-fi fans. I mean, scripts are good and everything, but, romance in a mystery/sci-fi movie? Romance as a conclusion ?! Wow. I was really disappointed. In fact so much disappointed i had to write this review. Don't get me wrong, movie as a movie is great, but that ending?! We sci-fi fans need some kind of a warning. This is a serious shock. Sorry if my English was bad."

"Dm86","5","3","6","2 February 2017"," Great potential, but still falls short
","When I first saw the trailer for Arrival, I was very excited - it's not that often we get to see some serious SF movies, not packed with action. I was excited to see how a brilliant director such as Villeneuve would approach the genre. The thing I hold against many SF movies including aliens is the lack of their background story. Who are they? Where exactly do they come from? How did they get to evolve into beings that they are now? What is their tech based on? Do they have art? What do they eat?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Arrival didn't answer those questions. All that we know is that the aliens will require our help in three thousand years and they've come to make sure we are ready by then. That is, in itself, very interesting and I liked it. However, it left me thirsty for more background to the story. Science fiction is not just science trying to be plausible. It is also fiction - and I love it because of that. I will most likely not meet an alien any time soon and it's movies such as this one that I hope will tell me a complete story of what might happen and who exactly the aliens are.<br/><br/>That being said, I wish the movie contained extra 10-15 minutes of various explanations and that's what it would have made it a 10/10 movie for me. I understand not all viewers feel the same and require a backstory, but I do. Without a backstory, I feel almost cheated. As if the storytellers say ""we didn't put extra creative effort into bringing you something that would complete the story and blow your mind."""

","Arrival is the latest alien movie to be released, and it completely avoids clichés, which is a good thing. Instead of relying on science fiction cliché and formula, it tells a very original story about a linguistics professor (Amy Adams) and a scientist (Jeremy Renner) who interact with these aliens that have landed in 12 different spacecrafts all around the world. The movie is very well written and the acting is superb on the part of Adams, Renner, and Whitaker. The effects here are great, the aliens look very interesting and I loved the way they designed the spaceships. I especially liked how the aliens communicated, their language and how Adams worked to decode it will really keep your attention. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, you will still walk away loving this film because it's just a very well made film that makes you think. The last thing Arrival is is generic, it's very intriguing and thought provoking. Go and see this wonderfully entertaining film! 9/10 for Arrival!"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","6","16","17 November 2016"," Life Arises in ""Arrival""
","""Arrival"" is beautiful. The first 3 minutes tell the heartfelt story of Mother and Daughter with few words. It fondly reminds of the movie ""Up"". The story resonates to our very souls. Here crying at the beginning of a movie is a good thing. All is not exactly what it seems, illuminating untold possibilities to come. That is part of the beauty of ""Arrival"". Amy Adams as Louise narrates, ""There are days that define your story."" ""Arrival"" embraces life in absolutely surprising ways.<br/><br/>Eric Heisserer wrote the screenplay based on Ted Chiang's ""Story of Your Life""; its title starts making sense. This is much more than an alien encounter movie. Director Denis Villenueve's ""Arrival"" is about the power of stories to inspire and define life. Amy Adams is amazing as Dr. Louise Banks, the linguistics professor, who must decipher the language and intentions of alien visitors to Earth. Adams embodies graceful humanity as Louise in her transformational journey from fear to wonder. Life is created and exists in our language. ""Arrival"" reminds us. <br/><br/>The sights and sounds of ""Arrival"" awe. Composer Johann Johannsson's score effortlessly captures the currents of emotion. Bradford Young's cinematography is brilliant. From the enormous scale of the Alien monoliths around the world to the isolation of Louise's room, he seamlessly fuses the story with clarity. Villenueve orchestrates these sights, sounds, and authentic performances to tell a story that moves us. <br/><br/>Dr. Louise Banks (Adams) is a single linguistics professor at a university. On the day that defines her story, 12 alien onyx monoliths about 1500 feet tall hover around the world. Their locations include China, Russia, and Montana. The aliens come from another world. Do they come in peace? Literally landing at her doorstep, Army Colonel Weber played by all business Forest Whitaker inquires whether Louise is the right person to decipher the alien language and their intentions. He soon determines she is. <br/><br/>Soon Louise finds herself on a military helicopter flying to Montana with Alien Team lead physicist Ian Donnelly, played by Jeremy Renner. Ian tells Louise that science is the key to civilization, not language as her book proclaims. Yeah, they're going to bond. <br/><br/>The monolith pods open every 18 hours, and Louise, Ian, and Weber must discover as much as they can. The strange creatures have seven tentacles; thus, giving them the name heptapods. Their oral language is indiscernible. However, their written language is like Japanese calligraphy circles with telling attributes. Watching Louise and Ian decode the language is mesmerizing; however, the story slows to a narrative crawl. Perhaps, the only downside. The upside is amazing. Paradoxically, the alien language is nonlinear: There is no past or future, only the present. Or maybe they are collapsed and all the same? All the while Louise is haunted by visions of her daughter. The Aliens possess a technology that may be a threat or a gift. <br/><br/>Life arises out of our language. Villenueve and Heisserer guide us with lyrical focus, and a welcome sense of humor. Louise tells a killer ""kangaroo"" joke. Amy Adams makes ""Arrival"" special. She has power. Adams instills in Louise the vulnerability and compassion that speaks to the hero in all of us. Renner is deceptively strong and tender in what could have been a predictable role. His authentic partnership with Adams generates the eloquent and sublime epiphany. ""Arrival"" invites us to make the story of our lives wondrous. ""Arrival"" is one of the best movies of the year."
"paul-allaer","8","6","16","12 November 2016"," Why are they here and how do we communicate with them?
","""Arrival"" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a group (12, to be exact) spaceships arriving on earth, and how mankind deals with it. As the movie opens, we see a woman (Louise, we later learn) with her daughter over the years, with her daughter passing away due to a rare disease. What is going on here? Louise turns out to be a linguist, and when a spaceship arrives in Montana, she is recruited as a translator. Turns out the aliens are ""talking"" through complex symbols. At this point, we are less than 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, one of my favorite film makers of this generation. He is on an amazing streak of quality movies. His movie from last year ""Sicario"" was my No. 1 movie of the year, and before that he brought us ""Enemy"", ""Prisoners"" and ""Incendies"". Here, he goes sci-fi, with the arrival of aliens, and leaving us wonder ""why are they here?"" and ""How do we communicate with them?"". If you are expecting an all-out sci-fi action movie (think ""Independence Day""), you will be sorely mistaken, as this is more the ""brainy"" type of a sci-fi movie. Think more ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", minus the action scenes, and with tons more of ""attempting to communicate"" scenes. Despite the mostly serious tone of the movie, there are some lighter moments too. After the very first attempt to communicate with the aliens goes nowhere, Louise asks the Army Colonel ""Am I fired?"", ha! Amy Adams (as Louise), Jeremy Renner (as the scientist) and Forest Whitaker (as the Colonel) are fine in the lead roles, but really take a backseat to the overall sci-fi setting of the movie. The photography is outstanding, and sometimes pure eye-candy. Last but not least, there is an outstanding soundtrack, courtesy of Johann Johannsson (who also provided the score for last year's ""Sicario"").<br/><br/>""Arrival"" opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but wasn't anywhere close to a sell-out). If you are in the mood for an 'intellectual' sci-fi that takes another look at the eternal issues confronting mankind when aliens come to earth (why are they here and how do we communicate with them), then this movie is right on target, and worth checking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Arrival"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"verna-a","5","6","16","11 November 2016"," Waving tentacles and swirling mist
","How do you like your sci-fi - hard and shiny or soft and gooey? Arrival is definitely down towards the soft and gooey end, I perceive while making out waving tentacles amid swirling mist. Unfortunately I am a hard and shiny fan and want to get some rational explanation for events depicted, so I am doomed for disappointment with this film. Yet criticism of the film can be based on more than taste, as any originality is distinctly limited. There is much in this film that is annoyingly formulaic. We've been here so many times before: the impatient, trigger-fingering military making things hard for the scientists, naughty old China and Russia making things worse, and the aliens taking offence at humanity's aggression. The first part of the film rolls along OK, but its a gift isn't it, the suspense of going into the alien spacecraft and making first contact with other life forms? After that things go steadily downhill, with the progress with deciphering the writing not really taking the audience along with it, and the hackneyed aspects of the story gathering strength. And it's all so S-L-O-W I had to fight an impulse to walk out.There is so much padding, mainly dwelling on Amy Adams' tip-tilted nose and emotional blue eyes. Whoever the aliens were, they clearly had not done any research on human psychology before coming here. Perhaps there are aliens out there who have done their research and that's why they don't come? Works for me! Regarding a rating for the film I'd say 4/10 as an experience for me personally, but in admitting that it is competent in many respects (eg acting and cinematography) and will appeal to a taste different to mine, I'm increasing it to 5/10."
"Troy_Campbell","10","6","16","10 November 2016"," An emotionally, narratively and visually spectacular sci-fi drama.
","Non-action science fiction films are becoming rarer than hen's teeth in mainstream cinema, usually skipping the big screen for a video-on-demand release due to their tight budgets. The one-two punch of this year's Midnight Special and Arrival will hopefully change that. Fresh off the modern masterpiece that is Sicario, director Denis Villeneuve again showcases his incredible talent by crafting a deeply thought-provoking motion picture that credits its audience with the sort of intelligence and maturity so few movies are willing to do. When alien spaceships appear in 12 random locations around the globe, the international community must band together to figure out who controls these vessels and, more importantly, what their purpose on Earth is. Enter Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams – amazing), a professor of language who is brought in to communicate with the extra-terrestrials aboard the spacecraft situated in Montana. Banks has her own personal problems though, with memories of her dead daughter permeating throughout her thoughts. These two coinciding plots are handled with immense care and precision, ultimately bringing an intense poignancy to the overall story that culminates in a fantastic final act twist. The unpredictability of the reveal is inarguably clever, but it's the extra layer of emotional depth it adds that really hits home. The imagery is spectacular too: the alien vessels are simple yet beautiful; the squid-like creatures are simultaneously frightening and graceful; and the gravity-defying environment inside the ship is presented with subtle wonder. The icing on the cake is the profound auditory experience that the film offers, with the glorious, otherworldly sound design and an affecting, sonorous score conducted by Jóhann Jóhannsson (whose Sicario score should've won the Oscar earlier this year). A contemplative movie that eschews big budget action for provocative musing, Arrival is a tense, emotional and utterly gripping sci-fi drama."
"lee_eisenberg","10","9","28","13 November 2016"," translation makes for a great movie
","I first learned of Denis Villeneuve when his Academy Award-nominated ""Incendies"" got released. He's directed some movies since then, but now he brings one of the most impressive movies. Although advertised as a science fiction movie, ""Arrival"" emphasizes language issues. Amy Adams's linguist gets hired to communicate with the extraterrestrial beings, and in the process breaks down their language. She notes that a person's native language influences how he/she thinks, and we soon learn that the aliens' language is unlike any recorded language.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie addresses our relationships with each other and with other species, as well as our place in the universe. But the language issues are the main point (as a man who's into foreign languages, I particularly enjoyed this aspect). It turns out that there is often better communication between the humans and the aliens than among the humans, as the different governments start refraining from talking to each other. Whether or not we can communicate with each other will be one of the most important matters in the coming years, especially if world leaders refuse to do so.<br/><br/>Anyway, outstanding movie. Also starring Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg."

","Well, the film wasn't that bad. It was however pretentious but it lacked the human drama, ethical decisions or any deeper meaning for that matter. It was slow paced, shallow, illogical and it finally ended up nowhere. Its major merit is that there aren't many Sci-fi films and I enjoy the genre. Wasn't a complete disaster but it is irritating that it is trying so hard, and there is no smart trick in the plot. It is exploiting the different time lines theme and this is almost always a trap for lots of reasons - basic or no scientific knowledge and understanding, bad adaptation or screenplay. This is usually insulting the intelligence of the audience, but I guess the high rating says a lot about this audience."

","Such wasted potential, what was Denis Villeneuve thinking?! I'm a huge fan of his movies - Prisoners, Incendies and my top 10 of all time fav, Sicario.<br/><br/>But this? ""Should I make a sci-fi movie about aliens making contact, or should I make a movie about a woman that can see into the future? Hey, how about I combine the two, to mess with the audience lol?!""<br/><br/>Seriously, each of these two components would have each made for a brilliant movie, but combining the two was just too convoluted, and in my opinion, a joke. <br/><br/>How can all these other reviewers call this brilliant? It was a mind game of constant convolution with sub par action, all star cast with monotonic dialogue that bores the viewer. <br/><br/>The entire cast was lacking in any adrenaline, and instead acted as if the coffee machine was down throughout the entire filming and they were struggling to act. Very monotonic and too slow paced. There is zero climax in this film to the point where I was borderline ready to fall asleep.<br/><br/>Sure the visuals 'at times' where stunning, and the score was appropriate, but everything else flopped in my opinion. <br/><br/>And the back and forth between the flashbacks/flashforwards was very tiring with 'way' too many plot holes. For example, if you know you will give birth to your daughter that will die (because you can see the future), and lose your husband over it (who happens to be a top scientist), don't have a child, and stay married, so these two genius can prepare the rest of mankind for the future 3000 year alien rendezvous that will occur. <br/><br/>That seems much more 'brilliant' than any other aspect in this film, and had that been the case, then maybe it would in fact have been a brilliant film. If you want to see a truly brilliant sci-fi movie, watch Interstellar."

"burties5","2","5","13","20 November 2016"," Such disappointment
","Very slow moving movie that has way less to do with Aliens, than the life story of Louise (Amy Adams).<br/><br/>Can hardly be classed a sci fi in my book as the alien story was unexplored and pointless, and lacking any surprise, intrigue, suspense, excitement, fun or amazement you hope to see in science fiction. It was about Louise and her slow, bleak, depressing life story.<br/><br/>The story gets more confusing the further in you get, until the ending had my husband saying WTF was that about, and me needing another 15 mins of thinking time to get it. <br/><br/>The credits rolled and I swear everyone just sat there unmoving.. it was like the whole cinema were going 'what was that about'? Or maybe 'that was a waste of money'. <br/><br/>Typical Hollywood trying to be too cerebral for its own good, I can only think the director made this in hope of an Oscar."
"SquigglyCrunch","10","5","13","16 November 2016"," An Amazing Story Accompanied by Great Performances and Beautiful Shots
","Arrival follows Louise Banks, a linguist who is hired to try to communicate with the aliens who have recently landed on Earth. <br/><br/>This is a very interesting concept to me. Most science fiction involves a bunch of gunmen getting together and blowing the aliens back into space, or just hostile aliens killing humans. This is the exact opposite of that. Is the concept entirely original? I don't think so, but I haven't seen a movie like this before regardless. <br/><br/>The performances are quite fantastic. I've made a point of seeing more Amy Adams movies as of late, and I haven't been hugely impressed by her somewhat exaggerated way of acting. In Arrival she humanizes her performance a lot more. By that I mean she's a lot more subtle and realistically portrays this character, and she is absolutely amazing. This is the best performance I've seen from her. Jeremy Renner is also great, pulling off one of my favorite performances by him. Forest Whitaker, for what his role is, does a good job too. In fact, I don't recall a single weak performance. Not that every single one was amazing, but none of them were below average, and those that were important to the story far exceeded that. <br/><br/>The characters themselves are fleshed-out and largely well developed. Do we get to see every character's life and struggles and all that in detail? No. But Louise Banks is the most intriguing character, and she receives a hefty amount of attention. There's no reason for the other characters to receive as much attention as her because the movie's focus never averts it's attention to another character. The movie is entirely from her perspective, even when something more interesting is happening elsewhere, which allows the audience to be just that much more immersed into this story and, more specifically, this character. <br/><br/>The writing is amazing. I was a little worried to see that the writer of this film was so inexperienced, but it seems like Villeneuve and his well-picked cast knew exactly how to take this potentially bad script and make it look good. However, this script isn't bad by any means. The way the story unfolds is fascinating to watch, and as much as I wish I could watch every little detail of the human-alien interaction, I knew that it would get tedious, nor does the movie have nearly enough time to go that long. I think the movie showed just enough to keep the audience invested and learning along with the characters more or less. And the third act was mind- blowing. I've heard plenty of people say that the third act flips everything on it's head, but I didn't believe them. Trust me though, it will. <br/><br/>Right from the opening shot, this camera man proves he knows what he's doing. This is a beautifully shot movie. Not only is the scenery glorious, but the way the camera is positioned and where it's focus lands is all gorgeous. Every shot was a treat.<br/><br/>Upon seeing the first trailer, I was somewhat disappointed by the look of the aliens. I later learned that I wasn't. At all. I love the design of these aliens. I'm not going to say any more, but they look great. <br/><br/>One of my favorite things about this movie is the amount of detail put into the aliens. They are an entirely different species, and the movie goes all-out with that fact. Everything you wouldn't even consider that could be different between a human and an alien is taken into account and changed for the betterment of the film. <br/><br/>Another little thing I liked was the reveal of the alien ships. Yes, they are revealed on the cover of the movie, but the movie still tries to hide them. But it doesn't go all out with hiding them completely, but rather use strategic camera angles to obscure the entirely of the ship. So it doesn't come off as the movie trying it's hardest to hide the ship, but rather making it natural.<br/><br/>I almost had one tiny complaint with this movie, and that was the very end of it. Without any spoilers, I'll say that it didn't fit with the rest of the movie and came off as somewhat generic. And yet as I left the theater I realized that the scene made complete sense within the story. While I thought the movie had lost steam, in reality it kept chugging along at an amazing pace. <br/><br/>There were a few points along the way, more towards the end, that I didn't understand right away, but upon further thought realized what was going on and liked the movie even more for how clever it was. It's a thinking movie that isn't horribly complicated. It strikes that perfect balance, and I loved it. <br/><br/>Overall Arrival is spectacular. The acting, the story, the writing, the camera-work, the detail, the characters, the naturalism, the twist ending, everything is fantastic. Denis Villeneuve once again proves why he's my favorite director. This is quite likely my favorite movie of 2016, and hopefully an Oscar contender in the future. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this masterpiece of a film."
"masonmorgan-92917","9","5","13","13 November 2016"," Arrival will become a sci-fi classic
","Arrival was my most anticipated movie of 2016 and upon seeing it I can surely say that it was definitely not what I expected, but it certainly impressed me.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite modern directors and has an admirable track record including Sicario, Prisoners and Enemy. Being a fan of all three of these films, I was very excited to see Denis tackle the broad spectrum of sci-fi. But Denis took a very different approach to the ""alien invasion"" genre and it completely paid off. Arrival is a much needed fresh breath of air within the science-fiction world and will be among the year's best films.<br/><br/>To start, Amy Adams' performance is Oscar-worthy. Her character goes through so many stages of emotions throughout the movie and Amy Adams perfectly captures these emotions, mostly without dialogue. This is very impressive. Jeremy Renner did a good job as well, even though his character wasn't really necessary within the movie. He isn't really given much screen time to really develop and he lacks ""the scene"" that solidifies his position in the story. The same can be said for Forest Whitaker's character. Because Arrival is more focused on these characters rather than our otherworldly visitors, this could be seen as a glaring issue, but the character's interactions are well done when they have to be.<br/><br/>All of Villeneuve's other films are beautifully shot using many different methods of angles, colors, symbolism and scale. Arrival follows this template and is one of the most stunning films of the decade. The circulating shot in which we see the visitors for the first time is utterly spectacular, with rolling fog briefly disguising the alien monolith. It is one of the most memorable and breathtaking scenes from any film in recent years. The entire movie looks visually stunning, from the green Montana valley where our story unfolds, to the ancient alien architecture. The ""heptapods"" also look awesome, but not overdone. Many sci-fi movies want to show us too much of their alien creations, which usually leads to eye-rolling when our expectations aren't met, but Arrival gave us just enough to satisfy our curiosity without going overboard and destroying the feeling of intense realism. Arrival is overall a visually breathtaking experience with it's immense beauty reflective among the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br/><br/>The music is also fantastic. From unsettling, soft choir hymns to bold and bombastic strings, the music is not present throughout the entire film but kicks in at just the right moments to accompany the films best scenes.<br/><br/>The films story is simple overall but takes an unexpected twist during the last third. This twist is brilliantly done and doesn't even feel remotely gimmicky. Once you figure the twist out, going back through the movie in your head to notice new little details is fun and even goose- bump inducing. This twist gives a whole new feeling of humanity within this alien ""invasion"" story and propelled the film so much further than I would've ever have expected it to go. <br/><br/>Arrival is just as much about human nature and psychology as it is about alien study. Unlike many other films within the genre, the human aspects of the story are just as good as the alien's.<br/><br/>I had only a few minor gripes with Arrival and that involves the galactic tourists showcased within the film. The ""main question"" that Arrival revolves around is never fully answered, and when it was, it seemed to be glossed over quickly as just a minor plot detail. There should have been a little more explanation on the ""big question"" because it seemed to be more of a marketing scheme that was never fully addressed within the movie itself. Another small issue was the process of learning their ""language"" and specifically how fast it happened. It seemed like one second we were trying to figure if the aliens even knew what words are, and the next they're speaking fluidly with the creatures. While it probably would have been impossible to explain the decoding of the language to the audience, it would have been nice to see the movie try.<br/><br/>Overall, Arrival is a visually stunning and beautiful story of human nature and our interaction with otherworldly beings. It feels extremely realistic in a way no other science-fiction movie has managed before, almost so real it could pass as a documentary. Arrival is a sci-fi classic, not just for our time, but for the times to come. Future generations will see Arrival as we see 2001: A Space Odyssey. And it totally deserves it."

","Dennis Villeneuve has created yet another excellent feature to add to his growing list of hits. Arrival is a visually stunning, thought provoking film that will keep the audience captivated from beginning to end. If you've seen Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, you'll notice many similar elements that have come to be a custom of the Sci-Fi genre. <br/><br/>Arrival follows the protagonist Louise, a college professor and a leading figure in language translation, as she attempts to understand an alien language in hopes of answering one simple question, what it is that brought them to Earth.12 alien ships, giant black totem shaped stones, spread throughout earth with its' intents unknown to the world. It starts off as a race between nations to discover the secret of communicating with these beings. I would best describe them as tall octopus like creatures, with each of their long tentacles being used as their way of communication, releasing ink to create shapes and figures. There's a concise message on just how important language is to civilizations, and how the slightest misinterpretation could lead to devastating results. <br/><br/>My last take away will be to praise Villeneuve's pacing of the film, he does it in such a way that reveals nothing too soon, but at the same time just enough to let the audience decide for themselves what the culmination of everything they've seen is leading towards. I look forward to watching the future work of an incredible film maker."

","They're many things we can gripe about with a lot of movies, but very few in Arrival (2016). When Arrival first started being promoted, I watched their trailer many times debating if I was going to see it in theaters or wait. My reasons for stalling had nothing to do with this movie, it only had to do with how all movies are being over marketing such as pushing a better trailer than the film etc. Arrival (2016) had an amazing, very interesting trailer; it caught my attention from the first viewing and from there my interest boiled till the release.<br/><br/>My intent was to watch Arrival (2016) on opening night though scheduling didn't allow so I saw it's first viewing this morning, and I must say I was not let down at all. Arrival (2016) was much more than the trailer, this film had a great cast and a very intriguing story line. The graphics were off the chart and the conception of the aliens were just perfectly matched.<br/><br/>Arrival (2016) is highly recommended for all the sci-fi fans out there, this film is awesome."

You really do need to pay attention in order to realize what is going on during each section of the movie. If you think scientifically you pick it up about 60% of the way through the movie but others never seem to really ""get it"". If you liked Momento, you will like this movie. The two have things in common with regards to a single aspect (Memory) yet nothing in common outside that one aspect.

","I've never written a review on this site, but I've also never seen a movie like this, so I had to make an exception. I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into this movie, and I was a little bit hesitant to see it. However, this is one of the most thought-provoking and emotional movies that I've ever seen. While the main plot concerns itself with the arrival of aliens on Earth, the movie never resorts to mindless scenes of action to entertain the viewer or add suspense. The writing and characters provide all of the emotional suspense that a person can handle. I found myself invested in the fate of the characters more than the threat of aliens. Without spoiling anything, the movie contains a twist that changes everything that you think you understand about the movie. The movie never holds your hand and respects the viewer enough to make their own decisions about the themes portrayed in the movie. I've never seen anything like this, and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to experience a movie that will explore complex themes in an approachable and understandable way. P.S. I can easily see this movie winning the Oscar for Best Picture of 2016. It's that good."
"Ben_Cap","8","5","13","12 November 2016"," A Must See in 2016
","Based on the short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang, Arrival is an interesting view on the common sci-fi trope of alien life forms landing on planet Earth. It tells the story of Louise Banks(Amy Adams, A linguist who is entrusted with the task of trying to communicate with the visitors, at least the ones located in the United States. Along with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly(Jeremy Renner) Banks must find a way to decode a language vastly different from ours, and figure out why these ""Shells"" have come here.<br/><br/>Lets start with the cast. While a bit top heavy those at the top are all such good actors you don't have to worry about the rest. Amy Adams is a true blue leading lady. She commands this role perfectly and turns in one of her most impressive performances. Full ranges of emotions and a real truth in her eyes that truly draw you into her character. Jeremy Renner has become one of the most reliable second leads in the business. His character is strong and opinionated, but really plays off Adams performance well and boosts this movie up. Forrest Whittaker plays Colonel Weber, the head of the team involved with the U.S. branch of the Arrival. While almost playing the spiritual villain in the beginning, he really is just a guy who has orders to fill and Mr. Whittaker is able to both keep you on his side, but also not fully trust him.<br/><br/>The writing of Arrival has ups and downs but really it is mostly ups. The plot is fantastic with several moments I did not expect at all. The way that the heavy science portions are explained helps just enough for you to understand why the characters are doing what they are doing, but not spending a large portion of the movie giving complicated linguistics lesson. The way the world reacts and then deals with the arrival is more realistic than I have ever seen before. It felt as if this could happen tomorrow and Arrival would become almost like a documentary. My only problem with the writing is that at times it could be contrived. Some of the dialogue was not perfect but really overall I can let it slide.<br/><br/>All of these things together make a great movie, but in my opinion it is the director Denis Villeneuve who makes all of these parts into one brilliant movie. His previous two movies Prisoners and Sicario were quite a bit darker, and honestly when I saw Arrival was rated PG13 I got a little scared but this guy continues to show he is one of the most talented Directors out there. The tone he sets with Arrival is so strong and pulls you into this world. The pacing of the movie is great and every scene has something to provide. I can say with full confidence that without Villeneuve this movie would have been a whole lot worse, even with everything it has going for it.<br/><br/>Arrival can be slow at times but it is really in the humanity of this movie that gets you sucked into it. The extraterrestrials add some wonder and fear into Arrival but the way we respond to them and the importance of some of the things we as humans have forgotten. I don't think it is any coincidence that Arrival was released the same week that we had a historic election, and above all the politics and who won or lost Arrival has a statement to make about the way we treat each other. I don't want to give too much away but I implore people who are feeling a strong emotion this week on either side of the ticket to see Arrival. I think humanity is about more than all of these petty disagreements and I believe Arrival properly portrays this sentiment."
"paparidgeback","9","5","13","11 November 2016"," Amazing film, but probably not what you're expecting
","ARRIVAL is a one of those amazing, quirky films that will certainly die at the box office because it's not a sci- fi thriller nor a futuristic horror story despite what studio trailers might lead audiences to expect. Make no mistake: the popcorn crowd will be bored witless by the end of the second act and discover themselves well-disappointed ... and confused ... soon as the closing credits roll. <br/><br/>Instead of high tech special F/X and an alien invasion replete with military fireworks, what ARRIVAL offers is a solid, well-crafted and earnest challenge to traditional concepts concerning the relationship of language to thought and perception.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuve handles the difficult task of presenting a uniquely realistic and entirely plausible ""alien arrival"" without divulging too much, or too little, ahead of the big reveal. Amy Adams is remarkable in her role as the solemn yet resilient Dr. Louise Banks, a college linguistics professor drafted to help decipher an alien language soon after their earthly arrival. Gorgeously filmed by Bradford Young and accompanied by a sumptuous soundtrack, Arrival delivers a two-fisted cerebral treat.<br/><br/>Think Whorfianism meets Eternalism ... and enjoy the ride."
"disney1113","9","5","13","11 November 2016"," A True Sci-fi Drama that Delves Into the Depths of Humanity
","Arrival<br/><br/>4.5 stars out of 5<br/><br/>By Stephanie Cieplinski<br/><br/>(Warning: May Contain Spoilers)<br/><br/>Paramount Pictures' Arrival is a true genre science fiction film juxtaposing the drama and emotional depth of humanity—what we know—alongside the mystical and extraordinary. This is not merely another horrific humanoid alien attack on Earth, but an exploration of how we as human beings all over the world react to what we perceive and the communication breakdown that can unnecessarily follow. Throughout the duration of the film we are constantly comforted and surprised. There's warmth and humor brought to the screen by Jeremy Renner's Ian Donnelly and Forest Whitaker's blunt Colonel Weber; and the emotional process of grief through the eyes of Amy Adams's Dr. Louise Banks. <br/><br/>Adams's character, Dr. Louise Banks, is intelligent and meek, yet she holds more power than meets the eye. She's been hired by the U.S. Military to aid in communicating with aliens, who have landed their ships all over Earth. Every country has a team working on deciphering the language and the means with which the aliens are attempting to communicate with. The aliens are there for a reason, but it will take Louise to keep interactions with the aliens peaceful. Most of the countries are very quick to think that they will need to go to war with what they perceive to be a hostile situation with these extra terrestrials. <br/><br/>To say that Adams shines in this role is an understatement. We've seen an array of work from her, but the role of Louise Banks takes us back to Adams's Sunshine Cleaning (2008) days by playing a seemingly passive and timid character that comes across with a freshness that moves the audience in a way that they didn't expect. Arrival isn't merely a film about scientific discovery or abnormal circumstances, but the process of mourning and the perseverance of the human spirit. Without a knockout performance from Adams, this wouldn't have been as successful. Jeremy Renner stands out as well as Ian Donnelly, a role that is out of the ordinary for him. Instead of his usual tough guy demeanor, we get to see him soften, obsessed with mathematical theory and cutely debate with Adams as the interaction between their characters progresses. Not to mention, good friends, Adams and Renner, have a quaint and subtle chemistry on screen that pushes the intimate feel of the film further. <br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve as a director has really outdone himself this time. After Sicario (2015) and Prisoners (2013), this film stands out with a similar aesthetic to the previous films. However, this film brings something fresh to the screen along with a gloom that doesn't seem quite as harsh, merely sad. Arrival breathes and moves in that lazy, rainy, after-school kind of day way. It pulses with the beat of something revolutionary and a twist that strikes the meaning of what it's like to love—your life's purpose and those closest to you—and how you'll go about on your path despite whatever obstacles stand in your way. <br/><br/>In addition to story, it can't go without saying that production was extremely thorough in making sure that a majority of what they were doing exhumed the right aesthetic to the academic and linguistic field. Lead Linguist Consultant on the film, Jessica Coon, says that the film is thought- provoking and was spot on with a lot of what being a linguist is like."

All actors/actresses do a sterling job and visuals/sound both focuses and mostly holds attention; even with the deliberate scene jumps which can be somewhat irritating. The attempt at narrating the various aspects of humanity and their struggle with this scenario is also well appreciated. So all in all I was building to a mighty ""well done"". However the ultimate outcome for sci-fi fans was a, frankly insulting, slap in the chops with a causal loop. Thus the geeks of the group felt doubly let down.

","I basically watched this because I'm unwell, needed something quiet to watch and knew that Jóhann Jóhannsson and Max Richter wrote the score; on that basis alone I knew it would be slow and uneventful however I was just left thinking ""why did they bother coming to earth?"" all they did was came to teach someone their language and then bugger off. someone suggested here that the aliens were in fact somehow Louise and Ian however that still doesn't account for the other 11 ships, was there a UK,Australian,Pakistani,Chinese etc Louise and Ian as well or are the US Louise and Ian special snowflakes? and you could argue the ouroboros style writing supports that idea but I doubt the film is clever enough for that and the artist behind the language just looked at a coffee ring left behind by his/her cup and thought ""that'll do"". then all the stuff with her daughter dying, what was the point in adding that - they could have just made a film about a couple and a dying daughter and fu*ked off all the alien stuff altogether - that would probably have been a much more emotionally compelling film to see. <br/><br/>ultimately this is a film for hipsters who are going to claim they understand some deeper meaning in this film, they'll write gushing reviews in their online magazines while the rest of us are left feeling somewhat empty and angry at knowing we basically died for 2 hours."
"Tweetienator","4","4","10","17 January 2017"," Sci-Fi !?
","Hollywood needs new ideas or new writers - Arrival is a kind of a mix of Gravity (heroine lost her only child, personal drama) and Interstellar (writers mess up with space and time) and what we mainly get is Amy Adams trying to talk to aliens (wasn't there something called Childhood's End!?) and almost no action at all but at least a couple of aliens (who reminded me a little like those ones in Monsters). But to be honest every Agathe Christie movie has me more captivated in solving the puzzle (of the crime) or watching an Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot in doing so as our heroes in Arrival trying to decipher the messages of the aliens. <br/><br/>Arrival is sci-fi of the kind that is more about a political correct agenda (don't fear the alien, this ingredient they took from District 9) as real sci-fi or even entertainment - I would prefer almost every sci-fi B-movie from the 50s with laser guns and stuff to this one who tries to be something like 2001 but fails heavy like Interstellar. To put it simply - the writers of Arrival are not in the league of Phillip K. Dick or Isaac Asimov and the like. This is ""sci-fi"" for the political correct audience (almost no violence and in the end all humans wonderously get into some human-world-brotherhood, as if all the conflicts and crimes just would disappear because of some aliens arrival) and like p.c it is: mostly boring. On top some of the talk about the difficulties to talk to aliens is almost zero science or at least only on a very basic level which everyone with some brains could tell you without studying anything. Alone the assumption of our heroes, that the aliens don't expect that the first of all questions of the humans to them will be something like ""what do you want or what do you intend to do?"" is so dumb - I mean those guys know humans have had no contact to other ""outsiders"" before and they travel the space so they are not dumb like apes - they will approach humans like apes and will know what kind of confusion etc. they had produced with their landings. And the regular cliché that the U.S. military or CIA or whatever organization of the government has no own specialists regarding communication with foreign cultures etc. is super-dumb. Another p.c. stuff: almost every movie nowadays has a woman as hero to save the world or to boss around etc. pp., I just wait for the first African-American transgender woman to save or conquer the world or Ethan Hunt returns after an operation as a woman ;) <br/><br/>But the worst is that the makers of Arrival have imo forgotten the main reason why you make movies: entertainment. And no, I don't need action to be entertained, I watched Polanskis Carnage and I was Extremely entertained without one explosion or shot done. All the real classics and masterpieces of sci-fi like 1984, Dark Star, Logans Run, Soylent Green and the many others raise big questions in science and philosophy etc. but they also ENTERTAIN great. <br/><br/>Arrival is everything but big in entertaining - e.g. Oblivion with Cruise is a masterpiece compared to Arrival. This I say with a heavy heart because I especially like Amy Adams as an actress (this is one positive aspect of the movie, her performance ofc is good). What else left to say!? I just hope that in the next movie of Ridleys Alien-saga the aliens and humans don't have something like cuddly or encounter groups to solve their ""communication"" problems :D<br/><br/>Note: If I would be a producer or writer I would make a persiflage-movie about the p.c.-movment with a hero like an African-American homosexual transgender of Jewish origin who is mentally challenged and sits in a wheelchair but is the best and most lethal special commando of the USA (with Trump as President) - the story would be executed in the tradition of Naked Gun with a good shot of Rambo brutality."

","Starts quite fine. But gets completely unbelievable after half an hour and does not recover anymore. The researchers try to find out how the aliens communicate with them. The kind of talking and writing of the aliens seems to be untranslatable. And I think - from what is shown to the cinema audience - it is impossible to make progress of translation in such a short time. The complexity of the alien talking seems to be so high that human being would need hundreds of years to get a clue how to do it. But the plot has to go on, and so arbitrary action takes place. The movie lost my interest and somehow it ended. I cannot remember anymore how. After two weeks I forgot most of the plot already..."

I'll give the film points for originality. At least the aliens didn't take on human form. I'm so tired of the Star Trek and Star Wars aliens that are just actors walking around in alien masks and gloves. Although to me the Arrival aliens looked like they just used someone's hands walking around in smoke. Seriously...their joints just look like knuckles. I liked the twist on their language and that the film showed deciphering it took some time and not just some lightning strike moment when the protagonist has a genius attack and suddenly knows how to speak to them. There were unexplained plot points, though. Why were the aliens returning in three thousand years? What was the gift they were leaving...that we understood their concept of time? Why was their relationship to Adams' character so personal? Whatever. I guess you have to be a real intellectual film student to get it. And what has Renner done to get to the forefront of the acting world? The Hurtlocker? The guy is deadpan. I didn't think it was the breakthrough movie of the year."

"Fiurilli","9","4","10","11 December 2016"," Amongst the best movies of the year
","The year 2016 has not been a very good one for any avid moviegoer as it is filled with mediocrity. It has not been a complete disaster though and there were still quite a lot of movies that were worth the watch. The ones that can be considered as the cream of the crop however have been few and far in between. For these reasons it almost feels like a small celebration when a movie releases that appears to fit into the last category. In a lot of ways this seemed to be the case for 'Arrival' as almost everything surrounding this movie seemed to suggest that this was going to a modern- day masterpiece or at the very least the greatest movie of the year. It featured an amazing cast and all of the media released beforehand was beautiful to look at. If the past has thought us anything it is almost a fact that movies with sky high expectations like these can only be a disappointment. Can 'Arrival' live up to the hype?<br/><br/>The story of 'Arrival' is centered around Dr. Louise Banks, a world renown linguist played by Amy Adams. The life of Dr. Banks changes dramatically when aliens land in twelve different locations around the globe. The United States calls upon Dr. Banks to find the answer to one simple question: ""Why are they here?"" At the helm is the critically acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve who has been on fire in the last couple of years with movies such as 'Incendies', 'Sicario' and one of my personal favourites 'Prisoners'. Once again Villeneuve, together with cinematographer Bradford Young, has managed to create a gorgeous looking movie. Almost every shot is simply mesmerizing to look at and a few made my jaw figuratively drop in amazement. All the shots merge together into one interwoven web of beauty and it isn't hard to argue that 'Arrival' is the best looking movie of the year. Ever present throughout the film is a great sense of tension that will keep many sitting on the edge of their seat. This tension paired with the relative slow pace of most shots and a soundtrack that is often oozing with theme represents a firm grip that never lets go once it has gotten a hold of the audience. My eyes were simply glued to the screen wanting to take in everything this movie had to offer.<br/><br/>Part of this can also be attributed towards the story this movie tells. The idea of aliens landing on the planet is not very unique, however the manner it is presented in is anything but. Following Dr. Banks' journey in understanding these aliens was incredibly fun and the manner they interacted with one another felt very realistic. Most events surrounding Dr. Banks also feel very real and it isn't hard to imagine that should aliens visit us in real life it'll look similar to how it is presented in this movie. The story 'Arrival' tells could easily have been one of the best we've seen in recent years, but there are certain elements which keeps it from reaching its full potential. Certain events feel forced or are simply glossed over, present are a handful of potholes and quite a few characters feel useless in comparison to Dr. Banks. There's also a bit of narration present in the middle of the movie which feels very awkward and misplaced and when the story of 'Arrival' meets its end it wraps up a little too neatly. A bit more polish should have gone into the storytelling however as it stands this still is one of the most interesting stories you'll be able to see in cinemas this year with a final act that makes the entire movie appear in a different light.<br/><br/>Something I cannot speak highly enough of is the superb acting from the main cast. Amy Adams in particular really gave her all with a performance that was absolutely stellar. Often without words she shows that there is more to her character than meets the eye and there is always a sense of an emotional struggle going on within her. Jeremy Renner, as Dr. Banks' love interest and physicist Ian Donnelly, also brought a great performance and the only real criticism would be that Renner does not always convey the sense that he understands what he is saying when he's talking about science related topics. Given his performance it is sad to see that the movie did not give his character the attention it deserved and that, in the grand scheme of things, his character did not attribute to all that much. The performances of Renner and Adams on their own are superb, what's even better though is the great chemistry between them and overall it was a lot of fun to see them interact with one another on the big screen.<br/><br/>Ultimately 'Arrival' did not achieve my unrealistically high expectations and it certainly wasn't the masterpiece it very easily could have been. It still is a very solid movie that most definitely deserves its spot amongst the best movies of the year. The acting performances 'Arrival' has to offer are incredible and the visual style of Denis Villeneuve is even more amazing. I do think that this is a movie that can only be fully appreciated after a second watch and as of right now I can only rate it a slightly conservative 8 out of 10."

What we have here is a mumbo jumbo story, make believe science, where If you don't know what to do, you just jump a few years in the future and get your answer, simple, no?<br/><br/>Let's get to the technicalities. First half of the movie, you get really big closeups of faces of people who are afraid and as they are afraid they shake, so get ready for zooms and shakes.

"luisgentil","5","4","10","6 December 2016"," Inconsistent
","Okay, I'm going to make a hyperbole here: imagine that you are trying to intermediate peace negotiations and break the language barrier between humans and an alien race. At one moment you understand the aliens saying ""death to all humans"", but maybe this is not what they said. Maybe you got it wrong, maybe ""death"" has a different nuance in alien language. Then you turn to the US Army and say ""They said they want to kill all humans"". As the soldiers run to their weapons and tanks you try to stop them because you don't know exactly what they mean. If you don't want to start a war that was a great opportunity to keep your mouth shut!<br/><br/>All my linguist friends were talking about how excited they were about this movie, which revolves around a linguist trying to decipher the language of the first alien race to ever attempt to make contact with humanity. It all seemed very bold and creative, and the trailer images of Amy Adams taking notes on cool looking circular scripts looked very promising.<br/><br/>But it became obvious that cool looking scripts were the only good idea in this movie. It is filled with plot holes and fillers that try to convey a deeper meaning that does not exist.<br/><br/>I'm only going to talk about the part that first attracted me to the movie, which was the linguistic part. So a US Army Colonel decides that this specific linguist, Louise Banks, is the chosen one in all America to intermediate humanity's first contact with an alien race, because a few years ago she translated a Farsi conversation. Even if you ignore the fact that almost every university in the world have Farsi classes, Farsi belongs to the same language family English does, and is easier to learn than more popular languages such as Mandarin, Japanese, and Arabic. The only other thing we get to know about her is that she is a college professor. Is she a renowned and published scholar? Maybe... nobody cares, she speaks Farsi so it will have to do.<br/><br/>And so the Colonel shows her what appears to be the alien spoken language. And later comes a scene when Louise repeatedly listens to the excerpt of alien conversation, and it almost looks like she's getting somewhere. And the next day she comes and says, ""You know what? Let's forget their spoken language altogether"". It looked like the producers wanted to develop something in this area, but gave up, and this scene of Louise attentively trying to figure out alien speak slipped through editing. Eventually Louise finds out that the alien spoken and written language are completely disconnected. How the hell does she find that out if she doesn't even attempt to learn the spoken language? And moreover, using a written language that doesn't represent the spoken language is as exotic and alien as medieval universities publishing in Latin rather than the local language.<br/><br/>And so the rest of the movie revolves around Louise trying to decipher the alien written language. She is placed as the leader of a team of people, who I suppose are there to operate the printer that prints the alien letters for Louise to examine. And even ignoring the spoken language the producers fail to offer a cohesive theory about the script. At one moment they decide that one circle means an entire sentence full of complexity, and that every little blotch has a meaning. At other moments an entire circle actually means only one word. As exotic and intriguing as this alien script first seems, it's actually not very thought through.<br/><br/>Basically she learns the language by writing English on a white board and getting an alien translation in return. At the end Louise acquires the alien language, and with it entirely new cognitive concepts that allow her to see through time, which supposedly borrows from the Sapir-Whorf theory. Then you need a huge suspension of disbelief to connect the dots and imagine that, even though everything she learned from the aliens was based on her own input, she is very smart and managed to figure out all the alien's mysterious new concepts which gave her superpowers.<br/><br/>She is able to get a glimpse a future where she writes and publishes a book that teaches the alien language. So in the future everyone who reads her book will have superpowers! Many people, including many of the movie characters who were trying to bomb the aliens would in the future be able to see their lives from beginning to end and choose not to make the stupid decisions they've made! You know what, I shouldn't overthink about this movie."
"vasco_cid","9","4","10","6 December 2016"," Thinking person's sci-fi.
","Villeneuve indeed has taken advantage of the latest trend of Alien's obsession with Amy Adams in which is, perhaps, the best film of either one's career. Building slowly and potently into the viewers mind, although slightly marred by a somewhat disjointed second act, Villeneuve's approach easily overtakes previous films with similar plot points by making the best use of an impeccable technical team in service of a sharp emotional script by Eric Heisserer. To further discuss the film without spoiling it is next to impossible. Everything from the premise, to the title and to the imagery are clues and spoilers to the film's purpose. Here's hoping, and it certainly is looking like it, that this venture into the sci-fi genre is justly rewarded come award season in more than the technical categories. Villeneuve, Adams and Heisserer certainly deserve so."
"grantss","7","4","10","6 December 2016"," Clever and thought-provoking but a bit underwhelming and derivative
","Aliens have landed on Earth, in 12 different locations. Language professor Louise Banks joins a US army team at one of the locations, in Montana. Her job is to try to learn the aliens' language and enable communication with them. Through regular meetings with two of the aliens she starts to compile a record of the aliens' ""language"" - a series of drawn symbols. The important question is - are they friend or foe? Other nations with alien landings are starting to view them as a threat, making it a race against time as war with the aliens could erupt at any moment.<br/><br/>Interesting, engaging drama. The concept of aliens arriving and how we deal with them, especially communicate with them, was well thought out. Could have been explored more thoroughly though.<br/><br/>The reason it isn't is that the movie takes a sharp detour towards the end. The aliens aren't ultimately the main story, something (or someone) else is. The detour is quite clever, and its point quite thought-provoking.<br/><br/>However, due to its late arrival, the second plot isn't explored much at all, just left as a profundity without much room for debate or development. This makes that theme feel a bit half-baked. This is exacerbated by the fact that it comes out of a storyline that had, until then, seemed unimportant and merely there as padding. So the profundity comes out of a story that you weren't that engaged with.<br/><br/>In addition, you feel blindsided by this twist. The focus is on and the engagement is with the alien story. When the ultimate theme comes along, the alien story quickly has to make way, making the ending to that feel rushed, contrived and a bit of a damp squib.<br/><br/>It also doesn't help that the plot feels a bit derivative, with movies like Contact, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Interstellar springing quickly to mind.<br/><br/>Overall: intriguing and entertaining with a clever twist but a bit underwhelming, given its potential."
"Tehmeh","9","4","10","4 December 2016"," It's beautiful.
","I don't mean just the cinematography when I say that ""Arrival"" is a beautiful movie, even though the movie surely looks good and visually portrays everything exactly as it intends to, but it's beautiful at its core - the story and the emotions it evokes in the process. I don't want to spoil anything and I'd advise you to refrain from watching any trailers to avoid spoilers. <br/><br/>""Arrival"" is both sci-fi and drama, very well shot and mostly well paced. It is not an action movie. Director Denis Villeneuve does not disappoint, and he's becoming my favorite working film director very fast. There's one thing that he excels at - building the tension and emotional stakes in a way that's admirable. He doesn't need to use obvious exposition or action set pieces to make a point. Nothing has to be spelled out for the audience (although some things in this movie are), and he can just let the moments speak for themselves. It's really subtle and effective at the same time without going full art-house. ""Arrival"" is sometimes subtle, sometimes not, but it absolutely nails the story it's trying to tell. The original story (called ""Story of Your Life"") is written by Ted Chiang and Eric Heisserer wrote the screenplay. I haven't read either, but based on this movie, the material might be very good.<br/><br/>Amy Adams plays the main role as a linguistics expert. She is very good, and there is that certain kind of confused melancholy she needs to convey through her expressions alone, and she nails it. All other roles could have been played by anyone. I'm not saying that everyone else is bad (I do like Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker), I'm saying that there was no room for anyone else to shine - and in this case, it's a positive. It's essential for the focus and the narrative, and the movie works partly because of it. Amy Adams is at the forefront and center and she's very good. With lesser talent, the story would have lost much of its impact.<br/><br/>The story is great. It's simple, both emotional and intellectual, and it has layers. It's told well, it's not overly ambiguous, it's not too grand and it's certainly not pretentious. Some people are saying that this movie is hard to understand, but I don't think that's the case. Some people will be disappointed about the lack of explosions and action, and will find ""Arrival"" boring. At times it can be kind of boring, but in the right way. There's intensity to it even when nothing is seemingly happening and the story is dished out to you in ways you don't even understand right away, which again goes to show how good Denis Villeneuve is at what he does.<br/><br/>The intellectual sci-fi part of the story is about communication, our concept of language and even the restraints that language can instill into our capability to imagine foreign concepts when we're dealing with something very difficult to interpret, something very alien. The emotional part is something very humane and also about having difficulties about understanding something: understanding life, love and death and the meanings we try to assign to those things because we just can't be at peace with them.<br/><br/>After leaving the theater, I've been in a melancholic, ponderous state of mind, thinking about the very basic human emotions and questions. Mostly love, death, and the simple things in between. I probably sound like a hipster now, but don't worry, this is not a pretentious hipster movie. It just strikes through that certain psychological barricade many of us have built for ourselves, and makes us really feel something pure again, like children. Even if those pure things can be quite sad.<br/><br/>If I have to complain about something, It'd be for just a few things: at some point of the movie, we get narration from a character we'd never expect. I don't like narration in movies, and I don't like narrative changes from one character to another. It's not a big deal, it doesn't last long and it also works in favor of the movie (info dump for the audience), but it felt a little off and made the pacing feel weird for a while. There was also a short subplot to create excitement, and it felt unnaturally rushed and simple when compared to the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>That's it, no more gripes. Visually, this movie is great. It's not trying to impress you, it's not about some forced ""look at what we can do"" imagery, but simple, beautiful and effective as means to tell a story and set up a mood. Cinematography is great, the effects are good and everything works together.<br/><br/>Prepare your ears for beautiful, haunting sounds and music. Max Richter's ""On the Nature of Daylight"" can very well make some of you cry (and some of you will also recognize it from ""Shutter Island""), and otherwise the score is full of atmosphere and ambiance when it needs that punch. Sound engineers deserve some credit too, because there are some very interesting sound effects in this movie. Saying anything about them could be considered a spoiler, so I won't.<br/><br/>I thought ""Hacksaw Ridge"" would be my favorite movie of this year, but after seeing ""Arrival"" I'm not so sure anymore. Both are great in very different ways. This one is certainly more subdued and artistic, but both have lots of beauty and impact to them. The impact of ""Arrival"" isn't a punch to the face, immediately felt, while ""Arrival"" will grow on you. I've been thinking about it for a few hours now after seeing it, and it just feels better and better. Recommended for anyone who wants their sci-fi to be about human emotions and drama, not about flashing lights. I can take both, but I'm glad how this one turned out. It's a beautiful, touching story with interesting sci-fi elements."

","A very thoughtfully made and thought-provoking movie. It balances extremely well an intimate look into the heroine's psyche with an original sci-fi premise. The heroine makes an enticing and touching character. Amy Adams' sensitive, even subdued (yet not muted!) performance is aided by a calm and supportive role played by Jeremy Renner, and a piercing performance from Forest Whitaker. They all help to create a low-key and very convincing atmosphere. Director Denis Villeneuve shows great skill in combining drama with a small and highly believable selection of visual effects which is done with the utmost attention to detail and show a true sense of aesthetic vision. This aspect of the movie is very impressive especially when considering the many temptations and over-the-top results out there nowadays... The design department and especially the conceptual artists who created the ships, aliens and visual symbols are worthy of praise."

It's beautiful, the sound design is amazing and the ending doesn't leave you disappointed. Movies like this are so hard to finish, and perhaps it could have done more, but it would have run the risk of turning more toward the action-sci-fi. I don't think I would have minded a bit of that, but it's not what the movie was about. The acting is understated but on point.

","I saw this film with a great sense of anticipation based on a particular professional review and some here in IMDb. My own reaction afterward is that I found it quite moving, but failing to offer any real message or insight. It is just a nice fairy tale in my humble opinion. I agree that Amy Adams' performance is superb, carries the entire movie, and ought to place her in contention for an Academy Award. The other principal actors are stick figures due to screenplay, rather than their otherwise demonstrated superb acting chops. I think their skills were wasted here. I do not believe this film is one for the ages like the groundbreaking ""Close Encounters . . ."", with which it is naturally compared. It is temporary diversion -- interesting and beautifully made, but ultimately forgettable."

Great acting from Amy Adams which was perfect for the role. And as I said, the starting Idea which was also kind of something new. Also the movie has a great first 45 minutes. It builds up intrigue quiet nice and in a nice slow pace. Everything understandable.<br/><br/>But: Then as the story keeps developing, its starts not making sense, the pace goes from slow to super-fast, you miss many things, cant understand why things happen, starts with many melodramatic scenes which you don't know how to order in the story and you have the personal story of the main character with all the feelings and on the other hand the worldwide disaster, and both stories feel like the are 2 different movies."

","""Arrival"" arrives garlanded with a lot of critical praise. Why, I ask myself since Denis Villeneuve's latest is fundamentally a load of old codswallop but with pretensions. It's certainly entertaining; Villeneuve is, if nothing else, a consummate professional but surely the comparisons with Kubrick and Tarkovsky are not only misplaced but insulting to two much finer filmmakers. A more likely companion piece is Robert Zemeckis' ""Contact"", (they both share a strong heroine), down to the sentimentality surrounding life, birth and, naturally, death. It's also full of gobbledygook about language that might not endear it to a multiplex crowd. Given that they have virtually nothing to do but look puzzled Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whittaker aren't half bad. The aliens themselves look like giant octopi putting this more in the category of the monster flics that America produced in the fifties rather than what appeared post-2001. Reasonably enjoyable then but hardly Oscar material."

","I watched the trailer of this film and i didn't know what to expect except a movie that's similar to Contact (1997), about aliens and contacting them. So i went in with that in mind, and boy i was absolutely wrong.<br/><br/>First of all, This movie IS a slow burn so don't just go in expecting an action movie with aliens attacking Earth and our powerful army just send them back to space, YAAAY. NO, that's not it, it's a smart movie about Humans.<br/><br/>The movie starts slow, a professional linguist (Amy Adams) is being called for help when the army found a mysterious object flying in the air, so she tries to contact them and from there the plot starts to get going.<br/><br/>The movie raises many questions: Why do we always imagine the extraterrestrial as aggressive beings? Why do we human just terminate anything we don't understand? Why our ego let us control the fate of others? Why can't we understand peace? <br/><br/>The Acting, The visuals, the soundtrack, the story are what make this film this year's Interstellar<br/><br/>The pacing is a bit slow, but it's done to grab you into the movie then lets you enjoy it as it unwraps its secrets slowly in the end.<br/><br/>It's a twisted film about humanity and fate, go in with an open mind and just sit back and watch closely.. It's a beautiful movie"

","I like to think of myself as an above average in intelligence human. But only after I discussed the movie with the lady friend I viewed it with did I begin to understand all of the plot (lines?). Now I understand that the circular alien 'writing' also represents how they view time - circular, not linear like humans do. So that takes me back to my 'Review Summary Title'. It is difficult for me to believe that the average American moviegoer - much less those in less developed nations - will understand or appreciate ""Arrival"". It has virtually no apocalyptic scenes with thrills and chills. So I will be totally surprised if it makes a huge profit. However, I recommend that somehow global arrangements be made so that this wonderful movie can be shown: 1) At the United Nations, and 2) By every government on Earth to its leaders and citizens. In that way hopefully some greater benefit to humanity - other than entertainment - will result."

","'Arrival' is the Sci-Fi movie that we have all been waiting for; it doesn't follow similar story lines that is typical of most alien films, whereby the plot simply comprises of aliens descending on Earth, find out that humans are dangerous and destructive to themselves and them, thus causing all out war - we have seen this time and time again, but 'Arrival' really sets the bar high in modern times for the genre. <br/><br/>This movie straight from the beginning shows off beautiful visuals and cinematography, courtesy of the bright cinematographer 'Bradford Young', which really resonates with the unique plot this film has to offer. <br/><br/>English and Science are the two subjects that are significantly key to the plot of this film, giving a sense of realism as to what we do as the human race to understand ourselves from a language perspective and our place in the galaxy and the universe, as well as our voyage for other intelligent life and how they might communicate. <br/><br/>'Arrival' will keep you guessing and mentally put you on the edge of your seat. You will be analytically questioning everything that is happening in order to make sense of what is occurring as the film unfolds. Things may seem confusing, but ultimately become more clear towards the the final act of the film. <br/><br/>This is a film that requires a lot of attention and the ability to think outside the norm. A strong contender for 2016."
"jscaife-69508","9","5","14","12 December 2016"," A Tale of Mystery and Perseverence
","I did not know what to think as I first entered the cinema to watch this movie. The trailer certainly does a fine job of setting the basic premise, enticing us to learn more without actually dropping any spoilers on our heads. Thankfully I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>First and foremost the choice of casting for the film's three primary roles was superb. Amy Adams gives a stellar performance as a linguistics teacher who suddenly finds herself in a truly unique and - to say the least - stressful predicament. Jeremy Renner meanwhile slips perfectly into the supportive role as Adams' associate without over-exerting himself on screen and stealing the limelight that Adams clearly deserves. Forrest Whitaker meanwhile gives a very realistic performance as as military officer confronted with an abnormal scenario who thankfully doesn't fall into any of the traditional stereotypes you would expect from such a role.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a high octane sci-fi experience then you may want to look elsewhere because this film is all about pacing. The build-up to the initial encounter with the 'visitors' is particularly harrowing and well framed. One particularly clever piece of cinematography stands out during this scene and will leave you wanting to know ever more about Earth's new arrivals.<br/><br/>As for the aliens themselves, do not expect to learn everything about their race, civilization, culture or even the full purpose behind their visit. These details are left intentionally ambiguous, with the film instead veering towards Adams' growing understanding of the creatures whilst a growing feeling of animosity is left to brew in the humans looking from the outside.<br/><br/>It is this distinction that makes the movie truly memorable. Rather than pander to traditional story arcs that are guaranteed to keep an audience mildly entertained, it dares to examine the possibilities of communication and understanding rather than that of straight-up conflict and war. The humans by comparison appear hostile and untrustworthy, painting a worryingly realistic portrayal of humanities true nature in times of crisis.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a movie that takes a step away from the stereotypical that keeps you guessing then I cannot recommend this movie enough. Packed with incredible acting, a haunting score and a twist that you'll never see coming, this is by far one of the best films of 2016."

","An alien film, that really makes us think. It's played very real if this thing would happen. The effects do not feel faked, it's like we the audience are seeing the spaceship has it was actually here. It's feels like a two part about aliens and who we are as a society. The phrase we fear what we don't understand does come into play.<br/><br/>This film is an odyssey, really pulls you in. A puzzle you slowly put together. It has a twist that even a movie critic didn't see coming. Amy Adams was really good, so Forest Whitaker, although Jeremy Renner felt under used for the most part. It starts out slow, but picks up has it goes on. This film reminds us that things are not what they seem, just when you think it's gonna fall in the category of those typical aliens invasion films, it quickly turns it around."

","After seeing the trailer and so many glowing reviews, I was really looking forward to ""Arrival"". Everything pointed to one of the best sci-fi movies in recent history, but the film failed to deliver on nearly every count. It's a snooze fest. What a disappointment!<br/><br/>Amy Adams did turn in an excellent performance as Dr. Louise Banks. She is really the only reason to ever watch this film. It's slow, boring and devoid of anything that borders on entertainment. I've seen it compared to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" but that was a compelling story with stellar production values. ""Arrival"" is neither. I've seen sci-fi movies from the 1950s with more convincing visuals.<br/><br/>The story is as muddled as the visual effects:<br/><br/><ul><li>The alien vessels look like giant grains of black rice. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The creatures are basically large squid floating in dense fog. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They bring us a ""universal language"" that they demonstrate by squirting ink on a window pane and refer to as a ""weapon"" (apparently there is no word for ""language"" in their universal language.) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jeremy Renner as Ian Donnelly, the supposed physicist, didn't seem to know anything about physics. He did nothing but follow Louise around. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Most of the story line involves Dr. Banks and Ian going back and forth to the big black rice ship trying to communicate with the foggy squid. Their painfully slow progress is as exciting as watching a snail derby.</li></ul><br/><br/>The ending is laughable. As I filed out of the theater, I turned to my wife and said, ""I'm totally confused"". She laughed and said, ""I was about to say the same thing.""<br/><br/>We overheard other people near us expressing similar reactions. One man said, ""I didn't get it, did you?"" and another said, ""What did we just see?!?"" <br/><br/>By midway through ""Arrival"" I was praying for its rapid departure."
"BigZ_7337","10","5","14","16 November 2016"," This Movie Broke Me
","From all of the excellent reviews and the enthralling trailers, I had incredibly high expectations for the movie Arrival as I was walking into my local theater. I left the theater almost on the verge of a panic attack with my expectations obliterated after the movie ended. Arrival was the most breathtaking and powerful films that I have ever seen, and I can honestly say that I have never had so strong of a reaction to a movie in my entire life. From the heartfelt cold open, to the appearance of ""Arrival"" signaling the ending of the movie, I believe that it was as close as a film can come to being perfect. The emotional perfection of the movie's climax was almost too much for me to handle, and it brought out a reaction in myself that I've only experienced when reading books (mainly from Robin Hobb and Patrick Rothfuss).<br/><br/>It was a joy to see a true Hard Science-Fiction story on the big screen, and Denis Villeneuve has proved once again to be a masterful director. Every frame of this film is incredibly gorgeous, and I honestly don't know how some of it was filmed, as things that have to be CGI look so real. There is so much I could say about the movie, but I want to avoid any chance of spoilers. However, I will say that the design of the aliens and their language was incredibly interesting, original, and beautiful. I loved how the creators of the movie embraced the fact that if we do ever meet any alien species, they are not going to look anything like us or immediately be able to communicate with Humanity. It's very interesting how the movie handles deciphering the Heptapod's language and teaching them our language, and while some could find these moments boring, for me they were engrossing. I wouldn't have minded even more scientific examination of linguistics and translating the language that bears no resemblance to anything created on Earth.<br/><br/>This movie may not be for everyone, but depending on how it holds up after multiple viewings, I might have a new movie in my personal Top 10 Films of All Time. I highly recommend it, and if you want to see a video of my full review where I go into spoilers for the second half, it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95ofAsrVZ6g"

","What would happen if you took a film like Contact, deconstruct it into the most archetypal questions that we face as humans, and then piece them together in a style that rivals the iconic cinematic mastermind of Stanley Kubrick? Add an actress who has never before been given the chance to show physical fear, the devastation of loss and the gut wrenching, gall drenched intensity of motherhood. Add imagery of possibly the most cerebral effort ever to portray extraterrestrial life, very cleverly delayed so that when you finally get to see them, your hairs stand up as they would when a growling lion walked into your bedroom. Add a soundtrack that is in a word primal. I kid you not. It sounds like it's been accidentally stumbled upon from a godly source. It blends perfectly with the sounds already produced by the alien life, and it is beautiful. It is beautiful! It bloody made me cry. It is thick and heavy like Wagner in places, and unearthly and hellish as Ligeti, and it spoke to me and fried the marrow in my shuddering spine. Then, take a surprisingly tricky theory from the mind of Jacques Lacan, create a fascinating linguistically sound writing system, and build a non-linear plot around that. And then show that to unsuspecting audiences across the globe, and make them walk out a little changed from when they walked in. A little sadder. A little wiser. A movie has crashed into my number one spot previously held by Iñárritu's Biutiful and has broken all previous records in my mind. I welcome 'Arrival' into my life."
"The-Sarkologist","9","5","14","12 November 2016"," Fascinating Concept
","I'll be straight out and say not to expect your typical alien invasion movie because the Arrival isn't. In fact it isn't your typical science fiction movie, or at least what we have come to expect from Hollywood these days. Instead of some action extravaganza with some rip roaring special effects, we have what is more of a drama with an ending that is quite interesting in its execution. Mind you, if you don't like straight out science fiction and prefer aliens running around with machine guns and huge battles in space then you are going to be sorely disappointed with this film. However, if you are looking for some form of speculative science fiction in the realm of what the genre was originally meant to be then you are going to be fascinated by this film, and the concepts behind the film are definitely fascinating.<br/><br/>As you are probably already aware the film is about a bunch of aliens who have arrived on Earth and the whole idea behind the film is for the protagonists to try and find out the purpose of the alien's visit. It becomes apparent at the end of the film, but the key thing comes down to learning to communicate with them, and this is what the film is all about – humans learning to communicate with aliens through a language that they have had no experience with in the past and through a writing system that is so different it makes Chinese (and Egyptian) look like a walk in the park (at least compared to English).<br/><br/>The idea is that one's language defines one's culture, attitude, and mindset. This is one of the reasons that the alien's have visited Earth, namely to see if we are able to communicate with them. Obviously we are because, like most Hollywood Movies, it does have a happy ending. However I don't necessarily want to reveal what learning the language ends up doing namely because it is a key feature of the film. However the suggestion is that by immersing one self into a foreign language one begins to change one's outlook on life. Okay, this isn't necessarily something that I can attest to namely because the only two languages that I know (other than English) are German and French, and I have not spent enough time in either Germany or a Francophone country to truly become immersed in the language.<br/><br/>The film itself is actually quite slow, but in a way I feel that it is meant to be that way – the whole idea of trying to decipher an alien language, all the while trying to do it in such a way as to first of all not misinterpret what they are saying (it is a little different to saying 'I am a coffee' as opposed to 'I would like a coffee'). Also, there is your typical race against time because not everybody is as patient as the main characters in the film. However, as mentioned, everything eventually works out, especially when they managed to translate what is in effect an incredibly complex language. However, as I have almost mentioned, this film is about language, and explores the complexity of it, and what effect knowing other languages have upon your outlook in life. Obviously, with a science-fiction film, it has what is in effect a science-fiction outlook. A good film if you life a thinking film, not so much if all you want to see are spaceships blowing up."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Our cinematic love affair with aliens goes back decades, and these films typically fall into one of two categories: evil aliens attack earth, or aliens come in peace and humans react poorly. We've seen aliens trying to provide us with righteous advice (The Day the Earth Stood Still, 1951). We've connected via a few musical notes (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, 1977) and radio frequencies (Contact, 1997). And we have certainly had our share of surprise and unwanted meetings (Alien, 1979; The Thing, 1982). Leave it to cutting edge director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners, Incendies) to find a new, more head-and-soul approach for the genre.<br/><br/>This high concept project is born from Eric Hiesserer's screenplay of Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of Your Life""  a title that makes sense by the end of the movie, but one a bit too blah for a big time production with Oscar hopes. Five time Oscar nominee Amy Adams plays Dr. Louise Banks, a renowned linguist and interpreter. There is an interesting and well done sequence at the beginning of the film that provides the back story for her character and the foundation for the final reveal.<br/><br/>A dozen oddly shaped spaceships have docked (mid-air) at various points around the globe. The one in the U.S. is hovering over  no, not Area 51  Montana of all places. Forest Whitaker plays the military officer charged with assembling the team that will try to communicate with the aliens. He chooses Dr. Banks due to her remarkable track record with languages. She is joined with uber-Science and Math guy, Physicist Ian Donnelly played by Jeremy Renner.<br/><br/>We do see the aliens and their artsy style of communicating (a touch of Rorschach), but this is about so much more than learning a new inner-galactic language. It's about how the military reacts, how the general populace reacts, how the world leaders work together (or not), and even how the military, intelligence agencies and academia coexist. It's about smart people working out a plan when the problem isn't even clear  a between-the-ears head-scratcher.<br/><br/>Mr. Villeneuve utilizes what appear to be flashbacks in helping us better understand Dr. Banks, but the element of time may not be what we typically accept in story-telling. The story, characters, cinematography and score (one of the best matches of music and movie all year thanks to composer Johann Johansson) work together to provide an engaging, nearly hypnotic movie going experience. Plus, I'm fairly certain this is the first alien movie to reference Abbott and Costello and crack a Sheila Easton joke. This is beautiful filmmaking that is also thought-provoking and encouraging of some species self-analysis (our species)."

","I do love science and science fiction.
But i had to stop the movie after 40 minutes.
Usually I always say: you need to finish watching the movie to be able to judge it.
But not this time.
This time, it was just so boring I couldn't find any reason to finish watching it.
Unoriginal story.
Illogical dialogues (the starting dialogue when the main protagonist is hired is one example, already mentioned by many other reviewers here).
Ugly special effects.
The ""spaceship"" has the typical minimalistic, unimaginative design used when there is no budget nor thought gone to its design.
It doesn't make sense, like many other things of this movie.
I imagine the conversation that the writers had when they came up with its design: ""how do we design the spacecraft? Nahh, the typical flying saucer is so cliche, let's make it look like a huge egg or bean instead. We can draw it with a quick 1$ graphics design job, doesn't need to look realistic. Doesn't need to show any mechanical parts, just a flat surface.""
Same thing goes to the aliens design.
Oh, and I do always love when the scenes cut just before some cool thing is going to happen. Really shows how much the movie has to offer.
The color palette, is so dark and depressing. Colors are cold and washed out.
I was wondering if my screen brightness had turned down for some reason.
Turning screen brightness up doesn't help - the film brightness is just too dark, that you can barely distinguish characters from background in most of the scenes shot in dark areas.<br/><br/>Overall, a boring movie, made even worse by its depressing palette."

What's really great about this movie is that all this grandiosity with the aliens is just window dressing to the real plot, which becomes the plot twist at the end... and is both challenging and gut wrenching. <br/><br/>We always question ourselves as a species. How many dreams started off on the quest for time travel? To seek answers or to change the past?<br/><br/>Truth is, if you knew what was going to happen, you'd be living a curse. You relive the beautiful moments only to know the inevitable demise of it all.<br/><br/>The aliens in this film aren't doing anything out of the goodness of their hearts, but because of how they perceive time. And because of that, they are slaves to it. They can never enjoy because they need to solve what is to come.<br/><br/>Our freedom is based entirely on our limited understanding of events. Ignorance is the most bliss you'll ever get. If you knew what's going to happen, you can never really enjoy life.<br/><br/>And that's the tragedy of Louise...and what she now endures. <br/><br/>This is what sci fi is all about.

"banzanbon","2","3","7","28 October 2017"," Slow and annoyingly sentimental
","I'm a linguist so the only part of this movie that resonated with me is Amy Adams' characters vocation and the thrust on language/communication. The rest of the film is flat and formulaic. You never really get a sense of who the leads are, other than some random 'passion' and sense of duty that sort of defines and binds them. It's pretty cursory.<br/><br/>The backstory of the movie is, in my humble opinion pointless though it's threaded throughout the script. It adds a somewhat unnecessary burden to the Adams character and creates a layer in the storyline that is used to for snapshots that the writer or director could have otherwise used to better develop the main narrative. <br/><br/>I like all the actors but it just bored me with useless artifice."
"jamesrupert2014","7","3","7","26 May 2017"," Slow-moving but interesting
","Visually impressive, ""Arrival"" follows a linguist's attempts to communicate with cryptic aliens against a backdrop of growing military-industrial paranoia. The acting and the overall look of the film is very good but it's a bit heavy-handed in its ""why can we all get along?"" message – which seems to be the 'message du jour' in Hollywood these days. I am not a linguist and have no aptitude for languages, but I found most of what Amy Adams' character says about the challenges and potential pitfalls in translating obvious and simplistic, suggesting that we're to believe that the military/CIA/government, who seem to have problems with this concept, must be pretty stupid. In general, I didn't find the early 'translating' scenes, which are central to the plot, very imaginative or convincing (compared to, for example, Stanley Weinbaum's 1934 short story ""A Martian Odyssey""), nor did I find Adam's behaviour, such as removing her protective gear so the aliens could see her, very believable. The movie has been called a 'thinking person's science-fiction movie but don't 'think' about it too much, it's not nearly as clever it seems to think it is and it falls into the usual time-travel paradox problems. Overall, I liked ""Arrival"" but seem to be one of the rare middle-of-the-roaders as this movie seems to inspire love or hate (at least on IMDb)."
"scroggs","3","3","7","13 May 2017"," Giant floating bananas disconcert the Chinese
","The banana is the most remarkable of fruits. Not only was it explicitly designed by Jehovah Himself for the health and pleasure of higher primates, the banana has contributed more to comedy than any other member of the Plant Kingdom. For example, who can forget this classic schtick —<br/><br/>BURLESQUE SHOWGIRL: Why do you have a banana in your ear?<br/><br/>BAGGY-PANTS COMIC: Eh?<br/><br/>BURLESQUE SHOWGIRL: (shouting) Why do you have a banana in your ear??<br/><br/>BAGGY-PANTS COMIC: You'll have to speak louder, I have a banana in my ear.<br/><br/>And of course, there are all those wonderful banana-precipitated pratfalls performed by every farceur since Charlie Chaplin. But alas, in spite of the banana's inherent jocose propensity, the gargantuan gravity-defying interstellar bananas that are the star attractions of this film elicit not a single titter, let alone a full-throated chortle. This is unfortunate because ""Arrival"" must be some kind of absurdist comedy. Otherwise, how does one account for the backstory sequence serving as the film's frontispiece which centers on the most laughably sentimental demise since Little Nell kicked the bucket? It's pretty much downhill from there with precious few yucks to ward off the encroaching ennui.<br/><br/>All joking aside science fiction is a tough genre that Hollywood routinely fails to pull off. Offhand I can think of but two that entirely met expectations: the brilliant 1950's B-picture ""It Came from Outer Space"" and Stanley Kubrick's enigmatic masterpiece, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". These films are relevant in context since they both address the theme employed by ""Arrival"", specifically Man's first encounter with an off-world intelligence.<br/><br/>""It Came from Outer Space"", faithfully based on a story by the remarkable Ray Bradbury, deals with a visitation by creatures that, though as physically alien as cheap 1950's special effects can realize, reason by a logic not dissimilar to our own. Crash-landed on a planet inhabited by well-armed and violence-prone primitives the aliens execute a reasonable yet desperate plan of escape. Through the aid of a human astronomer, they manage to repair their spaceship and depart, leaving the scientist longing for their eventual return. Kubrick took the opposite tack in his magnum opus. His aliens are apparently incomprehensible, yet they are definitely purposeful. They no sooner land on Earth, or more precisely their machine does, then they commence to execute their plan, which is the manipulation of the evolution of just another undistinguished root-munching anthropoid into an ingenious predator for purposes they keep strictly to themselves.<br/><br/>It is reasonable to assume that one or the other situation will apply if and when real aliens make contact — either we shall understand them or we won't, but in any case, their visit will be purposeful. ET isn't going to cross the galaxy just to sit in its starship and idly twiddle its appendages as the banana-nauts of ""Arrival"" spend much of movie doing, or more precisely NOT doing. Not doing stuff is much of what happens, or not happens, in ""Arrival"", which makes an inquisitive mind wonder what the popcorn one failed to buy when first traversing the lobby tastes like. And speaking of appendages this movie's aliens have tentacles. Yet more galactic squidoids... yeah."
"zevt","6","3","7","27 February 2017"," Ending ruins smart sci-fi movie
","Most of this opinion 'review' will contain major spoilers about the ending.<br/><br/>This is the kind of sci-fi I really like: Intelligent, challenging, with an exploration of big themes on humanity via a sci-fi element or a tweak to reality.<br/><br/>The themes are about language changing the way people think, rather than vice-versa, and it's about a very special tool/weapon that aliens bring to humanity. The story is about a language expert brought to try to communicate with the aliens via their very challenging alien form of language.<br/><br/>At first her methods look really sloppy and dumb, as she assumes that pointing to herself with a name card will communicate anything concrete and unambiguous, and that aliens have names. But it improves greatly after that.<br/><br/>The majority of the movie is very interesting and well done, including the cinematography, sound and effects. It's the ending that ruins everything.<br/><br/>She discovers that their weapon is really the gift of their language, which constructs sentences and concepts instantly without regard for the sequence of events. Thus, by really learning and practicing this language, the human mind gets re-wired and can actually rise above time and see the future. They give this to humanity in a way that will bring them together and cooperate, because they saw a future where the humans will help them in return. And then they leave with their mission accomplished.<br/><br/>Which is all very well and interesting, except that what do you think the military and governments that were all ready to kill each other throughout this movie, will do with the super-weapon of seeing the future? And what would the military do with people who can or have developed this ability? <br/><br/>Which is why the whole ending stinks and reeks of bleeding-heart, simplistic, childish naivete.<br/><br/>A belligerent Chinese general changes his mind just because she told him his wife's dying words, when obviously the only thing he would have assumed would be that someone bugged the room he was in. And even if he believed that she did it because she saw the future, his first priority would be to kill such a dangerous threat! <br/><br/>The movie hints that perhaps she is the only one that developed this ability because of her gift with languages and she used it for the good of mankind. Which is impossible to believe. As if the governments wouldn't put thousands of people on it to try to acquire the gift and use it for themselves. And even if they didn't succeed, obviously they wouldn't let her go free, and rival governments would want to kidnap or kill her. But no, this movie wants you to believe that suddenly humanity became peaceful just because someone can see the future. What an unfortunately silly ending."
"neil-26033","4","3","7","12 February 2017"," more a curiosity than a drama
","A complex, and familiar, alien contact science fiction drama that loses much of its punch being crammed into a two hour format. The result is a confusing storyline that rushes to an even more confusing climax and hammy finale. The considerable talent of Amy Adams is wasted, as are those of her supporting cast. Including the aliens. In addition, the big screen production values do not translate well to the small screen. This would have been a much more entertaining and powerful project as a limited run series on one of the subscription services. All that considered, I cannot recommend paying the considerable price of admission at Amazon, or anywhere else really."
"PyroSikTh","9","3","7","16 November 2016"," Best Movie of the Year?
","Arrival is the story of first contact between humanity and alien life, and how this first contact affects and shapes the globe. It is both epic and intimate in it's scope, focussing primarily on a linguist, Louise, as she attempts to communicate with the creatures. The whole movie is based around an element of first contact that is all-too-often glossed over entirely; communication. It evolves into a tense cat and mouse as eleven different nations try to figure out why the Heptapods are here and what they want, but refuse to share information with anyone but their political allies.<br/><br/>The very first thing that surprised me about Arrival was it's emotional resonance. The movie opens with a heartbreaking string arrangement and a series of scenes that shows Louise's relationship with her daughter, leading to the tragic death at a young age. The movie had barely even started and I was already on the verge of tears. As Louise starts to unravel the mysteries of the alien writing she's given, she starts to see more and more of her daughter as they broach closer and closer to flat out hallucination (without going all the way, I might add).<br/><br/>Being a Villeneuve movie you'll know, especially if you've seen Sicario, the level of tension he is able to create, and it is used here in spades. I mean this is very first contact with an alien species. This is a humanity-changing event. Arrival doesn't let you forget how monumental an occasion this is, and it puts you right in the characters shoes as they first encounter this new, unknown life. The first ascent to the ship is one of the best scenes I've experienced in a long time, and it is an experience. It harks back to Kubrick's 2001 in it's marriage of music and cinematography, amping up the suspense bit by bit as more and more is slowly revealed<br/><br/>Talking of cinematography, the whole movie is breathtaking to watch. Louise's first glimpse of the shell, surrounded by rolling clouds flowing over the hills is captivating and perfect for setting the mood. But it doesn't let up, using times of day really well, like sunsets and sunrises to show not only the passage of time, but offer a glimpse into the character's feelings at the time. The use of composition and framing is not lacking either, especially in that first ascent into the shell, with long slow shots of the dark exterior framing the white wall at the other end.<br/><br/>The visual effects as well are on another level. For the most part at least. The design of the Heptapods is harrowing, making their first appearance a sight that truly takes your breath away. As we see more and more of them, the sheer attention to detail employed by the effects team is nothing short of impressive. Even as Louise hallucinates to one appearing in her room, it looks so life-like and real. I had to constantly remind myself that they weren't real, because without knowing otherwise, I would've had no idea. Even the way they move is trance-like. The only criticism I had with the effects, and in fact the whole movie, was one sequence late in the movie where Amy Adams' hair is CGI'd to flow and move as if underwater, or without gravity. It was the only time the effects just didn't work and actually looked unbelievable. They should've just filmed her, at least partially, underwater to get that more realistic sense of how hair looks and behaves in that environment.<br/><br/>The music was another massive strength of Arrival. The score by Jóhann Jóhannson is haunting, filled with alien sounds that sound like nothing that could be recreated on this plane of existence. It massive sounding horn sections burst in and out with such urgency that they make you sit up in your seat and pay attention, and the amount of tension brought in by the deep drones of cellos and tubas is palpable. There's also great use of a choir that adds a new dimension every now and then, just to underscore the orchestral arrangements. The film is also bookended with a very emotional piece by Max Richter called On The Nature of Daylight, and it punctuates and enhances the emotional resonance of those scenes perfectly, while also tying into something the movie references a lot, which is loops, circles, palindromes. It brings the end back to the beginning, showing that the music is not an afterthought when it comes to Villeneuve's approach to filmmaking.<br/><br/>Arrival is a big contender for my movie of the year so far. Once the credits rolled, I was overwhelmed with feelings and thoughts and couldn't move for a few minutes. I spent the entire journey home in complete silence reflecting on what I had just witnessed. This is an alien invasion movie unlike any I have seen before, promoting peace and unity and hope like no other. It throws you in the deep end immediately with a heartbreaking tragedy that goes on to define the whole, breathtaking encounter. It makes a point not to answer every question you might have so as not to dilute and distract from the main focus of the story. And that twist in the final act genuinely blew my mind. Wow. I give Arrival a very high 9/10, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I was tempted to give it a full 10. Maybe on subsequent re-watches I'll have to come back and bump it up a bit. This is sci-fi at it's strongest, and I urge everyone to spare some time to go and see this. The big screen and top-notch surround sound of a cinema is absolutely the best way to watch this movie."
"mote99","Null","3","7","20 November 2016"," The ideas within Arrival get more and more interesting as it goes on...
","I caught a screening of Denis Villeneuve's ""Arrival"" recently and enjoyed it. Villeneuve's film starts a little slowly, but stick with it because the ideas within it get more and more interesting as it goes along.<br/><br/>It's essentially a thinking person's sci-fi tale. The story involves space aliens that land on Earth and the US government's attempt to communicate with them. The film is almost as much about language as it's about alien contact. And the narrative structure itself is a little unconventional, but I don't want to say more about it for fear of ruining the plot's surprises.<br/><br/>Anyway, thumbs up from me. If you enjoyed science-fiction films like Contact and Interstellar, you'll probably enjoy this one. And it's definitely worth catching on the big screen, because it's also a strong film visually."
"walter2-407-597390","6","3","7","14 November 2016"," It felt incomplete and disjointed
","I am a huge science fiction fan, and I love a good story of any kind, so I was really ready for this movie after the big build-up.<br/><br/>there is plenty of effect driven magic (I loved the clouds rolling over the mountain edges towards the ship site, that was the best visual in the film for me), but I found the story was flat and poorly told, with lackluster acting by everyone. I get the plot device of the cut-always and flashbacks, but this felt as if story elements were being added randomly without regard to their relevance or utility, and the un-heard episode of the Chinese general whispering is frankly insulting to viewers. didn't we at least deserve to HEAR this additional irrelevant bit of trivia after two very long hours? <br/><br/>I understand the movie was cut down from 3 hours (and started out as just a short story), and it felt as if every possible visual effects ship scene (whether useful or not) was retained, but every moment when the plot or important information was revealed was left out. yes, I get the premise, language can alter thought processes and our way of resolving the universe. not exactly breaking new ground there, but as a STORY, one just has to say at the end, what?? after two hours, this is the end? I believe strongly that more thoughtful editing and script writing would have yielded a vastly better movie, still sticking with these same plot elements. however, this version in no way satisfied me as a well-told story with something memorable to take away. unlike 2001 or Solaris or Starman, this didn't leave me with any memories I will reflect on later, except a deep and abiding wish for a better told story if I remember it at all.<br/><br/>Clearly a watch once movie. for comparison I have seen 2001 about a dozen times."
"fedor8","Null","5","15","24 July 2018"," A bunch of octopussies travel all the way to Earth just to give us a riddle.
","Usually a bad movie is either boring or stupid. This flick manages to connect a bridge between the two, accomplishing what only a select few bad movies have done before. Congrats, Villeneuve. If I used to be 99% sure I'll never watch your awful Blade Runner ""sequel"", now I am 100% sure of it.<br/><br/>These ""superior aliens"" are so inept and disorganized that they didn't even have the basic common sense to first LEARN an Earth language - ANY language (Swahili if need be) - BEFORE landing with 12 egg-shaped hover-crafts on Earth, scaring the bejesus out of everyone. Surely these ""superior"" aliens (let's call them squiddies) are smart enough to realize that Earthlings are deeply divided, paranoid, dumb and easily frightened. No? Well, in that case the squiddies are daft too, and that means the whole movie falls apart because its fundamental premise of a superior alien race doesn't hold water. <br/><br/>Speaking of water, they look like octopus. OK, fine: better than skinny bug-eyed big-headed generic anal-probing Area 51 type of green lizards, but hardly original or menacing or interesting. And the squiddies fire black ink too: what is this, a comedy? Is the fact they're octopussies the reason why they got along so well with girl-power girl?<br/><br/>I commend the film for not making this yet another absurd U.S.-centric invasion flick in which only Americans make decisions, where EVERYTHING revolves around the White House. Admittedly, Americans save the day - again - but at least it's not JUST about the Americans. But the way the movie goes about making this a global invasion is just embarrassing; it's pedestrian, utterly unrealistic. In essence, the best minds in TWELVE (read: 12) countries are working on this mystery, and yet the ONLY person who makes any significant progress is a linguist professor at some rinky-dink U.S. college where 5 kids show up to class. And when she finally makes a large breakthrough, those same government hotshots who trusted her and hired her aren't that interested in what she's got to say. Really? <br/><br/>The film is trying to tell me that China and Russia are so trigger-happy that they can hardly wait to attack a species that is so advanced that humans couldn't even figure out how they communicate between their 12 ships. Humans couldn't even figure out what the ships were made of! Yet they wanted to nuke them. WITHOUT being attacked first. It's so idiotic, you need be a fan of ""Armageddon"" to believe any of this malarkey.<br/><br/>The film is somewhat ""serious"" science-wise - at least until the story turns all stephenkingsian on us by unloading a huge psychic turdcake under our collective noses. Suddenly Louise reads the future! Why? How? Why her? What about the Russian and Chinese counterparts? Was the Sudanese girl-power linguist expert not competent enough to learn this ""time language""? Did the Pakistani girl-power linguist not try hard enough? Was she a lot less smart? Lazier? What?... Sure, whatever. It's Hollywood 2016 i.e. it has to be dumb.<br/><br/>Louise's sudden psychic powers are explained by her learning this ""time language"". Her theory that learning a language changes how you think was far-fetched enough as it is, but acceptable. They had to go a step further, however, and introduce this ludicrous premise that there is a language that makes you... see the future? I know this is sci-fi (well... soppy chick-flick sci-fi) but this is just too silly.<br/><br/>I also struggle with this laughable idea that aliens come here just to give us a puzzle to solve.<br/><br/>""We came here to help you, BUT you have to first solve an incredibly difficult puzzle. Failure to solve it could have disastrous consequences and actually ruin you more than help you, but we are willing to take that chance because we love playing around funny guessing games involving ink with inferior clowns such as yourself.""<br/><br/>By the time the movie had already spent HALF-AN-HOUR on humans trying to communicate with squiddies, I was getting impatient, figuring ""well, the film's gotta move on soon, can't be possibly ALL about this linguistic riddle nonsense"". Oh yes, it can! The entire movie is about this puzzle-solving drivel and those boring meetings between the romantic couple and squiddies! Nothing else. In fact, there are 37 of these meetings and I'm just thankful that Villeneuve decided to show us ""only"" 6-7 of those. (Feels like 15-20, but that's just me.)<br/><br/>The ""future flashbacks"" concerning her daughter are so very boring, mushy and visually flat, I wanted to fast-forward them: they look like shampoo commercials. In fact, my finger was nervously circling the FF button during the entire movie. I felt like I'd spent an entire day watching this dreary nonsense.<br/><br/>Get this: Louise has a child with lover-boy DESPITE knowing her daughter will die in her teens!!! Kinda defeats the whole purpose of HAVING premonition, doesn't it? ""Well, done, girl-power girl! You have obtained the power to see the future. Now feel free to not use it by not avoiding major mistakes such as giving birth to faulty kids"". Un-be-lieveable. Some people actually find this TOUCHING, INSPIRING even. Say what? Obviously people who agree with her decision don't have children of their own.<br/><br/>I also have to mention how unconvincing and dumb the notion of a benevolent alien race is. Look, I like octopussies as much as the next person, but the idea that a superior alien race is this NICE to us for no real reason than because they have great etiquette and a perfect moral compass, is asinine. It is actually possible to make movies with goody aliens, but it's very difficult to make them convincing and intelligent.<br/><br/>The incessant MUMBLING of the entire cast doesn't help either. These thespians hadn't even learned to SPEAK, yet they'd been cast in a big-budget film about a linguistic expert trying to solve a language riddle. Kind of ironic."

"Anaslair","10","4","11","26 February 2017"," Proof that sci-fi can have great quality
","Having heard about this movie and seen part of the trailer I had written it off as yet another sci-fi movie featuring aliens. There were people running around and being violent and aliens talking about weapons and an explosion and everything was frantic and I just did not feel like it was my cup of tea and that other similar movies have been made.<br/><br/>I could not have been more wrong and I am so glad I read a review on IMDb that changed my mind and made me want to watch it because that is so not what it is like. This is not just another movie about aliens. It is so much more than that. It is absolutely stunning. Mysterious and heartbreaking and everything comes around at the end. I honestly don't understand why try to pass the movie as something it is not.<br/><br/>There are very suspenseful scenes indeed where you can feel the sense of urgency and it is totally justified but ultimately the vibe of the film is awe-striking and somewhat dreamy, which has a reason why and is made clear as the movie comes to a closure.<br/><br/>The close-ups are incredible, moving, and the soundtrack blew me away. Oh my gosh. It gave an entire new dimension to the movie and completely involved me and intensified the alien atmosphere.<br/><br/>There is only one scene that I did not like because it felt like it did not belong, and the slow pace was a struggle sometimes, even if it was part of the movie's charm, but overall this was an absolutely incredible work of art and I hope you will watch it. If you stick to the story and pay attention, it will stay with you and you will want to discuss it after sitting on it. I know I do!"

Especially the sensitivity in Adam's character is very convincing.<br/><br/>The plot itself is well paced. There is no crazy action sequence, not crazy shooting or any wild and typical sci-fi element which is can be off putting to non-genre fans. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie greatly because and foremost of its witty and smart writing.

"trhliao","Null","4","11","26 January 2017"," Interesting ""puzzle,"" like M. Night Shyamalan films - but very anti-China/Chinese
","I thought this was a good movie, for the most part. It had a nice story, fine cinematography, a cerebral ""puzzle,"" moving moments, and decent acting. I thought this would be nominated for a few Academy Awards. This reminds me of M. Night Shyamalan films - sophisticated puzzles, a ""think piece,"" a bit gimmicky. <br/><br/>Racism and stereotypes are rampant in most US films. Arrival is based on a short story by Ted Chiang. He's Chinese American, but none of his stories have ANYTHING Asian in them. In the film, they put in the usual ""China-is-the-bad-guy"" crap - nothing new. They ALSO decided to make the white woman the SAVIOR who reforms the evil Chinese general. That's as old as Hollywood itself. A similar film is Anna and the King (1999), where Jodie Foster, the mighty and attractive white woman, comes to save the day. She ""reforms"" the backwards, misogynist Thai king played by Chow Yun-Fat. White people fixing up bad, backwards Asians is as old as time itself. And it insinuates itself into EVERYTHING, not just films. <br/><br/>Basically, US films, including Arrival, loves hammering in this:<br/><br/>**White = good, right, almighty **Asian/Chinese = wrong, backwards, evil, exclude, look down on<br/><br/>In the short story that Arrival was based on, Chiang failed to have ANYTHING Asian in it. That's the way he thinks and operates - every one of his 15 stories only have WHITE PEOPLE. To be an Asian American and to ONLY have whites in ALL your stories - what does that mean?! He thinks he's white, only hangs out with whites, and is, basically, white. For some reason, the film deviated from the story in that they decided to throw in an evil Chinese general who's out to destroy the universe. Maybe the Quebecois director decided to throw that in, and it had the COMPLETE approval of Chiang. <br/><br/>Chiang's one of the plentiful Chinese Americans who hate China and anything Chinese. That's a given - we grew up in a country that really hates us, so we hate ourselves and try to get as far away from our ancestral roots as possible. Chiang even wrote a New Yorker article bashing Chinese characters and claiming it's far inferior to English and Indo-European languages. Okay! <br/><br/>The guy who played the Chinese general is some actor named Tsi Ma. He has a long & acclaimed career, though none of us have heard of him. Despite his authoritative presence in the film, you can see Amy Adams looks down on him. See her face as she faces him in the grand party scene - she loses her usual pretty look and just looks blah. She's seeing a plain, slant- eyed Chinese man, and she finds his look, and his self, unappealing. That sums up how all people see Chinese people - even those with illustrious careers & an authoritative presence. <br/><br/>Adams' Mandarin is absolutely atrocious in the film. It shows that she really doesn't like the Mandarin language, or Asian people. She doesn't BOTHER to want to learn to pronounce those few lines better. This reminds me of the time Emma Watson & Daniel Radcliffe spoke some Mandarin, and Watson butchered it in the most embarrassing way. That's because she, and most people, simply have no respect or love for the Chinese. If Adams was supposed to speak, say, a French line instead, she'd try harder to pronounce it better, because she subconsciously loves and respects French better than Chinese. That's because everyone reveres white/European culture, while looking down Chinese, at least subconsciously. <br/><br/>Also, I have no idea why Adams' character spoke Mandarin to the Chinese general on the phone, and then he spoke perfect English to her when they met. This shows that people think Chinese don't know any English. Leave it to the mighty white woman to bow down to the backwards Chinese by speaking (terrible) Mandarin - when pretty much all high-level leaders in the world speak FLUENT English, including, apparently, this general when they met in the ball scene. So if her Mandarin is bad, and his English is perfect, why does she speak her poor Mandarin to him on the phone?! It was so bad I didn't understand ONE word she said. <br/><br/>People who hated the film can point out a lot more plot holes besides this one. There are so many contradictions - the filmmakers really didn't have their head on straight. <br/><br/>In the short story, the daughter died of a rock climbing accident at age 25. But in the film, she died of cancer/leukemia as a young teen. It really would've been more interesting if they stuck with the short story on this one. <br/><br/>The love interest in the short story was named Gary, but in the film, they changed his name to Ian. I guess Gary doesn't sound sexy for a love interest these days. The story was written in 1998, and I'm not sure Gary even sounded sexy back then. But I don't think Chiang meant for him be sexy - he's a theoretical physicist, for heaven's sake. But in a film, you need cool, attractive characters, so Ian it is. Jeremy Renner might be considered attractive in an odd way, but he lacks charisma and presence. He seems really boring. <br/><br/>Adams looks young for 42, thanks to celebs' constant use of Botox. She has an enviable nose job that gives her a perfect front and profile view. I think she got the same plastic surgeon as Jennifer Connelly because they have very similar slim, pointy, perfect noses. Adams only rose to fame after her successful plastic surgery - like so many other actresses, e.g., Catherine Zeta- Jones, Nicole Kidman. No one looks this perfect without going under the knife"
"jeff_dickey","9","4","11","14 January 2017"," A movie for language nerds, by language nerds. Non-nerds who think should enjoy, too.
","The movie opens with a university linguistics professor having some apparent dream sequences, followed by her arrival to teach an unusually thinly-attended History of Romance Languages class. We quickly learn that her language abilities range much wider, from South Asian languages to those of China (though there were snickers heard in the largely Cantonese-And-Mandarin- speaking audience I was with). What she gets pulled into is, of course, farther-ranging still.<br/><br/>At the very start of the movie, it's strongly implied that the professor, Dr Louise Banks, has never been married, and conversation with the other lead character, Dr Ian Donnelly, self-deprecatingly furthers the impression. Yet a major theme of the movie is grief over loss; we see her daughter grow up and die from a rare disease as a young woman; the experience drives Dr Banks and her husband apart. The grief is searingly portrayed; it is impossible to witness it without taking it as an authentic and major part of the character's life history. It shapes Dr Banks in very real, important ways that are essential to her character's actions and motivations in the movie. To dismiss Hannah as ""dream sequences"" is disrespect bordering on sacrilege.<br/><br/>Did any reviews you've read mention that the aliens think very differently than we do, and that their language, their entire basis for reasoning is based on their seeing time very differently than we do? This is another key to the story, for the clues dropped throughout the film, for the aliens' being very much in the here-and-now while having a very *different* concept of the meaning of ""now"".<br/><br/>I read linguistics at university, and one of my favourite professors started every lecture (reportedly over his entire career with the declaration that ""a *language* is the *definition* of a specific *culture*, at a specific *place*, at a specific *time.* Change the culture, the place, or the time, and the language *must* change; *when* the language changes, that is *irrefutable proof* that at least one of the others has as well."" (His emphasis.) Stick *that* in your pipe and smoke it while you're watching this, along with the question of the natures of time and of perception, and of how people in power have historically reacted to things they don't understand and aren't in control of.<br/><br/>The climax is a bit of a deus ex machina, and there are a few questions any hard-SF fan will quibble over, but this WILL blow your mind if you let it.

What I thought would be negative energy, since there have been so many negative events regarding personality, is surprising me daily. I am beginning to understand that the negative events were caused by a suppression of positive energy in each case and that much more than this, the entire worlds negative events are caused by a collective suppression of each and every individuals positive energy. <br/><br/>Words and labels, these are the idols with which we have thrust the lid closed on such powerful gifts, the senses bigger than all other senses combined, more lucid, more tangible and consequential than the individual imagination is capable of dreaming. <br/><br/>This is the manifestation of our collective being into reality. The new sense of our collective soul.<br/><br/>We have to help one another awaken, together. We have to try harder to describe and correctly interpret the nature of this energy so that we do not frighten ourselves and betray the purity of intention that our instincts are attempting to bring into the physical world, and to relay to others. <br/><br/>The new dawn of awakening is not just an awakening consciousness, it is the true nature of the universe blooming through into our minds. The true soul essence of the cosmos re-emerging as it is. It is only our awareness of that which already exists that 'appears' as the awakening. <br/><br/>It is a gift that is being given to us by nature. Humans will be filled with the reward, their suffering will be explained. Their ignorance will be healed. <br/><br/>The glove is becoming aware of the hand. The question is becoming aware of the answer. The emptiness is becoming filled by this awareness."""

","I have the feeling that I'm always farther and farther from the common people who write reviews and state that this film, among others, is a complete masterpiece. If they are smart people and they judge it to be a masterpiece, where does that leave me? <br/><br/>I'm desperate. Hopeless. Don't know what to do anymore.<br/><br/>I'm not going to pick every issue of a long list, because others have done that already. The flaws are many. Too many to count. Let me dwell into just one point, that according to the ""masterpiecers"" is THE clue to the story, that what makes you discuss the picture for hours: how do you handle first contact?<br/><br/>(This is a worldwide discussion; there are even TED conferences about this)<br/><br/>OK, so let's suppose these guys land (euphemistically, because their ship doesn't touch the ground) on our planet to give us a gift. Check this out: according to the film, WE have got to learn their language. We are primitive and they are incredibly developed. They didn't have the time or the will to learn ours, no, we've gotta do it. They want to hand us a bridge towards a completely different, far reaching mental state and yet, we have to get there with our aboriginal means... Like ""Here's Mars, and here are you. Now pedal on!""<br/><br/>The military, the approach, everything is very primitive: we're afraid, so we'll nuke you. Ah, and if we've got time, we'll try to understand you too. But don't count on it. Cause fear comes first and violence second. OK? We're humans, we trample everything we touch. Remember that. <br/><br/>What appalls me is the tremendous lack of imagination. A developed civilization will find means to communicate with you REALLY FAST AND EFFICIENTLY, don't worry about it!! They will make their intentions clear swiftly, believe me. In any case, they won't play games. Do you cross the universe to play games? And Hollywood movies are based on games, intrigue, mental mazes. All the time. They write exactly the same way we see the military handling the situation in this film: shortsightedly, projecting the present into the future, avoiding big intellectual leaps, looking for shortcuts. <br/><br/>If an alien civilization lands here you've got to shut up and listen. They'll set the rules. They'll explain. If they are good guys, and we too behave in a sensible way, then they'll give us instructions on how to get to their level. They will teach us. They'll understand our psyche and avoid reactions that could cause violence on our part. They would have studied us, they would know us. <br/><br/>And if they are bad guys, they would do some of the same. And kill us or enslave us or whatever. In a much smarter way. <br/><br/>These movies portrait aliens as if they were as underdeveloped as we are. And that's what make most of them dumb. Yeah, really dumb."

You wonder if the people that make these movies watch them when they're done. Didn't they screen this movie? This is the ending you decided to go with? Really? Wait for this to come out on TV. This is not a remake of ""The Arrival"" from the 90's with Charlie Sheen, which was much more intriguing.

I think at times the movie wallowed in it's own self importance and everybody was convinced this was a masterpiece from the outset.<br/><br/>Many times before have we seen this idea..Midnight Special done it much,much better and cleverer , others include Contact..War of the Worlds and The Day The Earth Stood Still( including the re-make) ,, with the exception of Midnight Special all the others are probably on a par with Arrival.<br/><br/>The thing I didn't get was when you say Sci Fi you think of science and spaceman..but nothing in the plot explained any of the science...the spaceships..time travel,,anything! Nothing went into the way the aliens traveled ..not too much of an important point but I think one that should have been addressed.<br/><br/>I have a feeling this will probably bomb as it is ,dare I say it, a tad boring.

"oleksabunyk","8","4","11","13 November 2016"," Great story, not so great sci-fi.
","Film ""Arrival"" based on short story ""Story of your life"" hard to judge. It is a great movie about First Contact with extraterrestrial life, determinism (fate) and some linguistic. Still, it had problems with science and some logic. Too many moments when you want to say ""Enough. Call the real scientist"". Despite all that I will write below, it is a great movie, but a question ""Why they are here?"" is not answered. <br/><br/>First thing: Do you know how many scientist are called, because of UFO? In the USA it two. Theoretical physicist and linguist. And at all, field laboratory looks just miserable, a dozen of tents and five pickups. Like, why someone should care about 500 meters flying egg? <br/><br/>And our two scientists must decipher language of aliens. Yep, the theoretical physicist is the right person to do it. In all movie, he did not do a thing as a scientist. All that he do in a movie, can be done by anybody without a degree. More of that, he is just for lulz. One scene from movie (approximately): ""Ian: ""Do you try to show them Fibonacci set, or etc.?"" Colonel: ""We can't even say hello to them, and you suggest so high matter. All laugh."" Like intelligent space creatures will faster understand a word ""Human"" written on a table, but not science facts and laws which probably similar in the whole universe.<br/><br/>One more thing. The best linguist in the USA, and what did you do with her? Right, let she go inside the alien ship unprepared , where they control gravity, is possibilities of radiation and so on. It is safe of course. We check it twice. And you can use video connection between the inside of ship and laboratory, but why?<br/><br/>All these small details are so embarrassing that just destroy all science at the first half of the film. Of course, some science is good, and it was great to see WolframMathematica on theirs PC. <br/><br/>But mostly it is a drama about destiny and choice. The film is nice, story - great, picture - breathtaking and peoples in government are corrupt. I was not bored at all. Some flashbacks of the main character look unclear for the moment but their sense opens at the end. <br/><br/>It all opens at the end, and it is great. Bad thing is that answer for the question ""Why they are here?"" is StarWars classic ""these aren't the droids for which you search"". But if you are immune to this Jedi things, you can say: ""Hey, but why did you come? Come back, now explain it to us, not just to Louise."""
"itesgong","8","4","11","12 November 2016"," Arrival - The Meaning of Language
","The movie starts with a silent scene, filming the inside of a house next to a stormy sea - I find hear 'sea' a key word, because of it's meaning: something moving back and forth without stopping, something endless. On the right side, there's a table with a bottle of wine and two half full glasses. This scene is important, as it will become a part of a loop which connects to the idea of 'endless', as suggested by the sea. <br/><br/>It is Dr Louise, with a Phd in Linguistics, that is approached by the intelligence to translate a language that the visitors are speaking.<br/><br/><ul><li>What visitors? - Just 10 minutes ago, a black alien space ship standing horizontally, has landed and the military recorded these sounds. Can you translate this?</li></ul><br/><br/>The context is much more complex than this short dialogue is showing. Dr Louise and the scientist called Ian are sent on the ship, where gravity makes them walk on walls. Before the encounter, Dr Louise is having visions of a child she doesn't know, she's having memories of things that didn't happened. Being overworked by the military and going through a tormenting series of memories, her emotional state is stretched even further by the overwhelming contact with the Heptapods, the aliens that look like an octopus. It seemed to me like a cliché, watching in the cinema, octopus shaped aliens making powerful sounds and coming to a meeting with a linguist. Also, the aliens were using their tentacles to spray ink that would form a shape containing information - their language, a non linear language that would express a system of concepts in a shape, a picture of their thoughts in a split second so you don't have to use words and waste time. Based on this, it's the crucial idea of the movie: time and how a language changes the way the mind perceives the world, which tells you that the aliens were seeing time as circular. So, like the sea ... endless. And coming back to Dr. Louise's memories, by the time she decodes the alien shapes, her mind begins processing the memories further in time (because of the way the language affects your thinking), seeing the future and using information as the world is coming to global war, having a bad understanding of why the aliens are on Earth. Chine declares war and all the other nations follow, but at a critical moment the time line of her memories matches the time line of her present day and she remembers future events. Using the information from the future, she stops the offensive, but there's something else: that room again, with the view at the stormy sea and the table with a bottle of wine and ... one glass of wine now. Because, there she is, with her husband (the scientist) and daughter (the child in her memories), just pouring some wine in her glass, watching her family. Her future family, because right now she sees Ian, just outside the military base around the alien ship, having no idea that he'll be having a daughter with her, and the ... endless stormy sea.

"charliesonnyray","10","4","11","12 November 2016"," A Must See From 2016
","There are many films coming out this year that far exceeded my expectations but Arrival is at the top of the list. This is not only arguably one of the greatest films of the year but one of the greatest science fiction films ever. The story follows linguist professor Louise Banks-played by Amy Adams- who is assigned to help the military communicate with a group of unusual extra terrestrials. However, the situation is slowly falling apart as many people are starting to worry that the aliens might have sinister motives. The premise alone doesn't sound like anything too great but it is truly the execution that is what makes the difference. Amy Adams and Jeremy Reiner play well off one another as both colleagues and love interests. The special effects-even the CGI-are also beautiful and completely realistic. But that is the great strength of this film: it's ultra-realism. The scenarios, the dialogue, the science, the language, all of it could possibly happen in real life. That's what makes it so absorbing. It's not a feel good movie like Independence Day but a thinking man's film that's still very entertaining like 2001 Space Odyssey. But the best part is the ending. It might be confusing at first but if you think about it, you will begin to understand it. Arrival is definitely one of those movies you need to see twice in order to fully understand it. If you enjoy films that make you think twice about what you saw, then Arrival should be at the top of your list. With great acting, direction and special effects, Arrival is totally worth a second look."

","Went to see ""Arrival"" tonight: If you are only a Sci-Fi fan for movies that have lots of action, this movie is not going to be for you and I do not suggest you going to see it as you will find this film very slow and boring....However if you like Sci-Fi movies such as Interstellar, Predestination, Contact, etc.....you will want to give this movie a go! ""Arrival"" was beautifully shot with a refreshingly non traditional look for an alien specie for the big screen. The movie has a thought provoking take on communication and the possibility of a greater ability once comprehended. Keeps you thinking throughout the film and well afterwards. Amy Adams is brilliant as usual and though a strong support cast was not really needed for this one, Jeremy Renner & Forest Whitaker were both solid and complimented Adams nicely.......If this sounds like it might be up your alley, I definitely recommend it."

","I have just seen the arrival and overall it is a good movie. If you are expecting to see some serious fights and mind blowing action scenes between aliens and humans well this movie is not for you. The arrival is a very human movie around 12 alien space crafts showing up overnight and the events fallow the incident. It allows the audience to be able to see the human nature and all our primitiveness behind our technology and science. Throughout the movie one can see how hostile and paranoid we can be towards each other as humanity and as nations. We have very little faith in unity and almost every time we prefer fighting over reasoning. The story is good and catchy. Acting is also good. A good sci-fi movie with a story to tell..."
"marcos-73933","1","2","4","3 January 2020"," WRITTEN BY ALIENS TO MIND-CONTROL US
","This movie is so bad that there's only one way to make sense of it: it's written by aliens who have little understanding of humans but want to put us in a trance to mind-control us. So beware of their tricks!<br/><br/>HYPNOSIS TECHNIQUES AND NARRATIVE DISCONNECTS<br/><br/>Long, pointless montages of unimportant aspects of the story with an annoying single violin playing randomly in the foreground that force a cognitive dissonance -- and we wonder, ""Can this actually be important? It must be if it's emphasized like this. But it's so banal."" It makes one's stomach churn like a spinning computer wheel.<br/><br/>A main story that is edited to leave out the most important parts, like a football broadcast that doesn't show the touchdowns or concert footage that doesn't show the band. For example, the translator's first encounter with the aliens and later her discovery of how to read the language are simply...left out. We're not supposed to notice that she simply starts to use a translation app that has magically appeared on her tablet as if the aliens got it approved on the app store.<br/><br/>Too much time in general spent on unimportant aspects of the main narrative, like a chef who serves up an excellent steak dinner and talks to you at length about the color of the plate. A long montage at the end of the movie that forces us to endure supposedly meaningful scenes of a close relationship that for the rest of the movie has only been terse interchanges involving work, and which becomes as impactful as watching strangers kiss in the park.<br/><br/>DISCONNECTED CHARACTERS<br/><br/>People who don't talk to each other in normal language, but use unnaturally quick, staccato remarks as if they are mind-controlled aliens themselves. Interactions in which there is nothing beautiful or even moderately functional.
A linguist who can barely speak as the main character, who spends most of the movie muttering in half-whispers.<br/><br/>LOGICAL DISCONNECTS<br/><br/>Aliens that make animal-like sounds while authorities bring in a linguist and not an an expert in animal communications, or at least someone who speaks Wookie or who has seen the whales in Star Trek IV. Kind of like a hockey team bringing in a soccer coach.<br/><br/>Not giving a briefing or any training to the translator, as if one's first encounter with an alien species doesn't need that. An encounter team that is forced to wear awkward, loose plastic suits when over on the next hill a ski team is wearing state-of-the-art, skin-hugging protective fabrics. Forcing the team to go to meet the aliens immediately after they receive a broad-spectrum antibacterial vaccine as if the body doesn't need the required three days to integrate the formula and develop immunity, as if it's enough to take the vaccine for show.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>So overall the effect is to create a trance that puts one's mind on spin, ready to receive the embedded commands from the off-planet intruders, or makes the mind resist so much that one doesn't know whether to keep watching or run away screaming.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate, because the concept of the movie is good and the story introduces linguistic concepts that could have been explored more deeply.<br/><br/>But at least if you watch The Arrival then the horrible series Another Life will suddenly seem like a work of art."

Someone trying to set a bomb off in the alien space ship for whatever reason seems to be the story. Nope, that's not it either. Toward the end, the linguist knowing a tiny piece of her future seems to be the story, but then that's not it either because it's just a scene or two and has zero connection to the other story themes (language, aliens, bombs), of which there are many. I went to this because I heard it was a profound story. But the supposed profound bit just sits there, disconnected from and underdeveloped as a coherent part of the story. This story was so pieced together it appears to have come from multiple authors who all have very, very different personalities and who couldn't agree what the story was about. So then the aliens take off and we learn almost nothing about them. What the heck? The only part of this story that seemed to have come from one author's soul is the linguistic part, which takes up so much room. The rest makes no sense as part of this story."

"niccoloparrino","8","2","4","7 December 2018"," A breath of fresh air from the sci-fi world
","Can a sci-fi movie be really intimate? It can, and if you haven't checked it out already, ""Arrival"" does it. It's not one of a kind, ""Interstellar"" had a similar scope, but it offers something more. Firstly, it respects the audience in the sense that it feels plausible, and it should feel this way. How can an ambitious and surreal plot live on a basis of wacky science fiction? In the first part of ""Arrival"", the viewer is stunned by the dazzling images and the extraordinary hypothetical scenario. Already enough entertaining, the movie then takes another unexpected course. The plot grows more twisted, without becoming too convoluted.
One beautiful thing that sometimes happens in movies is when an already meaningful element takes on an even more significant nuance. The initial monologue about memory, about the scattered recollections from an entire life, already beautiful in itself, becomes part of the significance of the whole movie, and it's truly satisfying when it does.
""Arrival"" hits the right spot and makes all the pieces fall into place, bringing an ingenious idea to life, which can also live outside the intricate sci-fi context."

No shoot outs, no alien punching, no cheesy one-liners, and no comic book nonsense! Yay!"
"theresamgill","8","2","4","12 June 2018"," A strong film because it was placed in the right hands
","I would honestly compare Villeneuve's visceral punching, yet subtle vision-driven storytelling to that of Alejandro Inarritu (The Revenant, Babel, Birdman). If you want simply solid films built with tension and sometimes delivering thought-provoking plots, Villeneuve is a good choice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So what is Arrival? 12 alien spacecraft vessels with strange, black, oval-like shapes touch down (well, they hover above the ground) around the globe. And one of my favorite things about the film is that it knows people don't want 30 minutes of exposition explaining the backgrounds of the charcaters and why they've been chosen; Amy Adams is a skilled linguist professor, and she's headed toward the spacecraft in under 20 minutes with an established background already setup. She is taken there by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) and accompanied by theoretical something physicist with toned muscles Jeremy Renner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the strongest aspects of this film-just like the visually stunning 2049-is the logical flow of events in the film. It makes sense why Adams and Renner are needed for communication, and the way they go about everything is just smart and practical. I'd prefer not describing how they interact with the aliens-even if that comprises a large bulk of the movie-but just know that the plot structure is much more sophisticated than a typical Hollywood summer flick.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For a film centering around alien contact, it is incredible to see how rooted in humanity the story is. Much of the conflict arises from trust issues from around the globe and especially China's thinning belief that the aliens are here for peaceful reasons. Their turn towards more aggressive tactics and other countries following suit is where the pickup in pacing comes from. And it's also where the film deviates even more from the norm. If you're watching this film in a personalized setting like on your laptop, put some headphones in and crank that volume up. There's a big reason why this film won an Oscar in sound editing; the effects have to be so precise when so much of the plot relies on a linguist trying to figure out how to properly communicate with mysterious aliens that are humorously named Abbott and Costello (Who's on First reference) by Renner. And instead of having a huge, Hans Zimmer score punctuating the action, there's a much more surreal feel from the lack of Johann Johannsson's score (who works with Villeneuve on practically everything). For example, Adams needs to take a breath of fresh air from the stressful work environment, and as she is outside in the beautiful Montana landscape and she reflects on past exposition regarding her family, the touching flashback only has the sound of wind blowing on the tall grass that Adams is sitting in. The minimalist approach brings the audience in closer to this intimate scene, and we hang on every frame.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So this is like a masterpiece? Well, not exactly. Again, technically speaking, it's near perfect like how Inarritu is. But that doesn't necessarily translate to simple entertainment value on screen. These are wonderful kinds of films that can be discussed for hours, but that's not the point of this review. To keep it relatively simple, Arrival is a good film that will keep you intrigued for its duration. But you won't really walk out after the credits and be like, ""Wow, that was great!"" Actually, the effect it will have is probably closer to a desire to go get a mocha, sit by a rainy window of a wooden table with comfy, contemporary furniture at that hip coffeeshop that will have a name like The West Side Coffeeshop or Hot Coffee with Cool Friends, and you'll just want to think about life. I will say with about 20 minutes left, the movie had me worried about what strange, complicated direction it was going to take, but then it fooled me and went somewhere else. It's a clever, cool looking film that is logical at every turn (unlike all teenagers in horror movies)-but I'm not sure it's enough to be classified as ""one of the greats.""

By typical I mean something that features incredibly ill-tempered creatures with goo dripping out of their every orifice, whose only purpose in life is to hurt, eat and destroy us puny humans.

","The delicious irony of Arrival is if the alien squids came to help the humans develop so that they could help the aliens out in 3000 years then Amy Adams's Louise is doing it wrong because she KNEW the future but didn't want to change a thing about it despite gaining clairvoyance. So, I'm sorry to inform the alien squids, but y'all are mega screwed. Once I got this deliciously dark ending, I came to enjoy Arrival better than the boring slugfest this was and why I didn't flat-out give it 1/10. It's a good metaphor for how we are living today. For example, we know about climate change and how our future is heading but we don't really care about it to change our course in any meaningful way. It reminded me a little of Hugh Laurie's speech in Tomorrowland. <br/><br/>Otherwise looking at Arrival, the actual meat of the story was delivered in the last five minutes. What a waste. Even the actual conflict between Louise and her future husband was off-screen. At the end, we're supposed to be comforted at his words about how he fell in love with her when we know they're empty words. Shortly before, she was telling him her husband leaves her and as a top-notch physicist he should have figured out she had no husband, not then and there of course as he wouldn't have known at the time, but later by putting two and two together. If he can figure out heptapod lingo, he sure as heck can figure out English. Boy, I'm not letting that fly. We don't see any of the pair's future marital woes over the loss of a child directly. THAT would have made for insightful drama. Except the drama ended just as soon as it really began. Sort of like the movie ended the way it began. It's not ""smart"", it's just hollow. The only way it could end that way is if there is an emotional payoff and I couldn't have that in the last five minutes I remotely began to feel anything during the movie. <br/><br/>So instead we got a nonsensical plot which ended up with a 8/10 imdb rating. Next time please cut out the aliens, I mean middlemen, and skip to the real drama of the movie. You CAN cut a movie non-linearly without relying on sci-fi tropes. If Memento did it, so can you, Arrival.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a pity Arrival had a nonsensical plot.. I guess to fit a nonsensical world. Bravo."

","We thought this sounded interesting so we streamed it via Amazon. It got off to a good start by keeping the pace slow while introducing us to the main character and what makes her tick. All good films spend time doing this, rather than jumping straight into a screenful of CGI explosions and wrecks.The intrigue built as we saw the mysterious ships and then their occupants with which our hero must communicate to see why they are here. Sadly, the story gets a bit up itself at this point, with memories of her dead child intruding (for no good reason as far I could see) and see rather too many visits to the 'interview room' on board the spacecraft as the aliens' language is (kind of) revealed. The denouement (such as it is) comes when it turns out the scientists have mistaken the word 'language' for 'weapon' (like you tend to do) and the whole global panic was for nothing.

","If you're looking for a tense, unsettling and powerfully atmospheric sci-fi complete with stunning visuals, enthralling drama and mind-blowing thrills, then look no further than Annihilation. With his signature style, director Denis Villeneuve creates an absolute masterpiece with this film, providing not only a visually beautiful sci-fi, but also a film with such ingenuity, and such an affecting atmosphere that your eyes will be glued to the screen at every moment.<br/><br/>There's so much about this movie that will send shivers down your spine, but the majority of that can be attributed to just how powerful an atmosphere is created throughout every single moment. Much like his previous work Denis is able to craft a both elegant yet powerfully unsettling vibe around the entire film, and in tandem with the film's jaw-dropping visuals, there's something so affecting about the film that you can't get away from at any point, pulling you further and further into the bizarre and mysterious world being created before your very eyes.<br/><br/>What's even more impressive is how the film manages to combine various genres in a both innovative and cohesive manner. Its sci-fi elements take centre stage throughout, but alongside that, there's a distinctive haunted house-style vibe surrounding the scientists' journey into the ""craft"", creating great tension that far surpasses typical horror movies, and makes for an even more thrilling watch throughout, as you feel deeply unsettled by the potential for danger in this new world alongside the wonders and marvels that have been created.<br/><br/>And then on top of that, the film does a brilliant job of being an engrossing character-based drama as well. Although not all of the main group of five are as interesting as one another, Amy Adams's character is indeed a riveting lead, bringing emotional depth to the story as well as an endless curiosity that makes what would normally seem like stupid horror movie decisions feel a lot more understandable, and much easier to relate to.<br/><br/>In all truth, I won't say that Annihilation is on the same cerebral level as the likes of Ex Machina or Annihilation, but the way it goes about its story, at its core a conventional adventure into the unknown, with such bold ingenuity and endless imagination is absolutely stunning to watch from beginning to end.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, the film is powerfully unsettling, even featuring what I can call one of the most stunningly disturbing scenes ever put to film, but it's still an entertaining and engrossing watch throughout, thanks to beautiful visuals at every moment, engrossing characters, a very strong lead performance from Natalie Portman both on a physical and emotional level, and brilliant tension and sci-fi intrigue that will definitely have your jaw on the floor come the end."

In texts, emails, phone calls, video conferences, and even face-to-face, people manage to blow their chances to meaningfully connect with their own species more frequently than any of us would like to admit.But what if you weren't trying to communicate with another human, but rather with a completely alien species from another planet?

"Luis_Pineda","8","0","0","21 January 2020"," Good
","Even when the story in ""Arrival"" (the alien invasion) has been seen many others times, from literature to film, it is the way how the story is told the reason why this movie excels. It can remind us to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or to ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"", both movies directed by Steven Spielberg. These films care more about the encounter with the aliens instead of a war against them. In 'Arrival' the previous step to an eventual war is the work that linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and the theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) must do. I highlight this film for the atmosphere that creates with 'the arrival' and the patience it has to show the aliens or even their spaceship. It's until the moment Louise arrives to the camp that we can see the spaceship clearly and it's until the moment that she enters into it when we first meet the aliens. Well, this is because the story is about her, not about the invasion.<br/><br/>Maybe, the most outstanding of this movie is its use of the Kuleshov Effect, which is the different meaning that a sequence of images can have depending on its order. In the first scenes of ""Arrival"" we see the story of Louise and her daughter, Hannah, and how this latter grows until she gets sick and dies. The next scene is Louise getting to her job and being a little indifferent to the news of the ""arrival"". We see her and she looks sad and then, we get to know that she has a lonely life. Immediately, we relate this to the scenes we saw before (the story about Hannah) and we conclude that she was happy while her daughter was with her but, now that she passed away, Louise leads this sad life.<br/><br/>As the movie film goes on, we realize we're wrong, what we saw is correct but it hasn't happened yet, it will happen in the future. The story with her daughter Hannah doesn't happen yet and this life full of happiness is coming. This is the Kuleshov Effect. Even though I think this is the best of the movie, I think it loses its strength at the end and the resolution is not the best. I don't like the final o real encounter between Louise and the alien, or the revelation that Ian is her future husband. Another bad thing is that sometimes the movie is over explanatory and confusing on purpose.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this isn't a perfect movie and it's far away of being a memorable sci fi movie but it has very good approaches and in general terms is a good movie."

Amy Adams is wonderful and I'm glad she got a few noms for this movie. Honestly, you really have to be in the right state of mind for this movie. It's a little more psychological, and there is a spin on time and the date the movie is happening in. I loved that the film was focused on communication and linguistics. It's hard to find an alien film without the entire plot being them trying to destroy the earth. Make sure you have your popcorn and have already been to the restroom, because you could get confused pretty easily if you miss something. It's a very different movie in fact I would say it's the sci-fi movie for people who really don't like sci-fi movies.

I would love to shortly answer to this: first of all we have no idea of what the problem they'll need us to solve will be, so we have litterally no hint about if thr problem itself could ever be solved by aliens alone. Second of all the movie stands by the concept of a unique timeline so they knew both this story would've gone this way and that they would have behaved exactly like how they foresaw, because that's the huge implication over there. Given this info it comes naturally that she had no choice in having a baby with Ian because that is how timeline works in this story. Does timeline work like this in our universe?

"tomlawrencemultimedia","6","0","0","7 October 2019"," Overall decent presentation, but completely illogical
","The beginning of the Arrival is tense. It successfully evokes a fear of the unknown, emphasized by scenes shot with dark lighting, as well as beautiful cinematography. It's definitely an atmospheric, thought-provoking film with slow pacing - much like Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 in that regard. However, so many things don't make sense.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems is how stupidly aggressive governments around the world act in response to the aliens' arrival. This behavior is primarily shown through the perspective of the American military, which feels as if humanity is on the verge of extinction. Do you really think an alien civilization intelligent enough to come all the way to Earth would wipe us out for sport or, as suggested by one intentionally insufferable character, convince us to kill each other (which we do already)?<br/><br/>They could've exterminated humanity long before we even knew what was coming, seeing as how they appeared out of nowhere and avoided initial detection. In particular, one scene with a rogue military unit blowing up a spacecraft (which defies the laws of physics - should give you an idea of how primitive humanity is by comparison) and killing one of the aliens is absolute nonsense. If there was any hope of fighting back, it already left the moment the aliens landed.<br/><br/>This is where things get extremely complicated. After the aliens teach humanity their language and cause their perception of time to become nonlinear, Arrival is unclear on what that actually entails. If the past, present, and future all happen at once, then the cause/effect relationship doesn't exist, which means nothing can exist in any state. The phone call paradox scene could not exist either because a time travel element would have to be introduced, which is not possible according to the possible perception of time explained above.<br/><br/>Furthermore, because the movie presents two perceived experiences of time (normal time and a learned, altered perception of time), logically one has to be the ""true nature"" of time. Both cannot be true. That leads me to the alternative, slightly more plausible option, in which case humanity becomes aware of time being predetermined after learning the alien's language. However, even if time was predetermined, the future still could not influence the past without a time travel element being introduced. This means, no matter which way you look at it, Arrival's story is impossible.<br/><br/>In addition, while the while the flashbacks (later revealed to be flashforwards) are interestingly woven into the plot as a part of the main character's personal mystery, her story is ultimately simple and flat. She decides to have sex with the scientist because she remembers the future they have together, she has a kid with him even though she knew she would die of a rare disease, and he agrees to be with her even though he knew she would not tell him that she knew the kid would die, so that means he knew what he didn't know before he did not know it.<br/><br/>If you're thinking, ""Wait a minute. That doesn't make sense at all!"", you're absolutely right. Throw some aliens into the plot and that's basically the entire story. There is no character development or romance to enhance it either - just a very simple plot, which makes you think way too hard, and a very beautiful presentation. Even if the movie did make sense, it would've been better with a deeper plot and some answers to the most profound questions it asks. Why do the aliens need help in 3,000 years? Where did they arrive from? Why do they need primitive humanity to save them if they're so advanced they can manipulate the laws of physics like gods? Alas, nothing is answered.<br/><br/>Expanding upon the initial tension, Arrival honestly would've been better as a horror film."

","The Sci-fi genre has been getting a lot of love from the academy recently, with Gravity, the Martian and now Arrival being nominated for best picture. It is about the arrival of 12 alien ships in different parts of the planet and no one knows what they are here for. That's where linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) comes in. In order to know what the world is up against (or is in for), someone needs to ask the RIGHT questions and be able to understand CORRECTLY the answers they will give. It is important to highlight the need for clear communication because if we humans speaking the same language often end up in misunderstandings, what more with extraterrestrials that uses a different language.<br/><br/>While the movie is enjoyable and thought-provoking, at best it can be considered as a paler version of Interstellar. First, it touches on the concept of time, how looking at it differently than the usual linear way that we do can make you look at things, and your life differently. Second, they had to change the original ending since Interstellar's arc already covered the concept of leaving earth for someplace else.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I'm not sure if it's because of the story or the way it's written but lead stars Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner were underused but both were able to make the most out of what they're given.<br/><br/>If I were to rank the last three sci-fi movies nominated for best picture, Gravity comes in first, the Martian second and Arrival for third place."

"taiscpilato","8","0","0","5 February 2019"," The movie presents relations between communication, technology and globalization
","In the film ""The Arrival"", is raised the question of how our globalized world would react after the unexpected visit of strange speakers of a strange language, called heptapods. The linguist Louise Banks is called to decipher what the purpose of the visitors is.<br/><br/>The first sight of the globalization process on the subject is when Louise enters the command center, where several video monitors are running, each one with a representative of the countries where there were landings. It is a great conference where each nation would update the other on what each one has learned about the pretensions of the aliens. That way, the tecnology is indeed shortening distances and promoting cooperation between nations, as the ideal of globalization intends .<br/><br/>However, this harmony is short-lived: when they discover the offer of a ""weapon"" to be shared with Earth, the line of communication is cut off and some countries isolate themselves with bellicose proposals. And the borders close again. Also, the US military is reluctant to accept Banks's theories, who says that ""we need to teach the difference between a weapon and a tool. Things can be confusing when the same object can be used in both ways."" The cause of the desunity among the nations is, however, only a matter of misinterpretation of the new language: the ""weapon"" was the ability to have a new vision about time, given as a gift to the Terrans because the Heptapods would need our help three thousand years from now.<br/><br/>In the film, the linguist makes it clear that language is a bridge, a possibility to live with the other, that the other can be understood in the light of multiculturality. Unfortunately, at the moment of crisis the possibilities of union are forgotten and the world takes a defensive attitude against the heptapods, demonstrating the fallibility of communication between nations, even in a planet that is globalized.<br/><br/>Drawing a parallel from the film to actual events, we can see that it portrays the importance of communication in world politics and, tied to it, technology as a (dis)service to human relations. The criticism made in the film can be understood as the fact that humans have more difficulty understanding each other than to understand a completely new language and no phonemes related to spelling. Turning to technology, which provides all the necessary means for communication between people, it is clear that it is commanded by something not so interested in globalizing the world in an ideal way, but in the ways pointed out by Brazilian geographer Milton Santos: globalization as fable and perversity.<br/><br/>Because of all of those aspects, this movie is very efficient when shows that technology may help communications and a fair globalization, but this process is delayed by the selfishness of the nations. And as happened in the movie, was only overcomed after a new view of time - here almost as a superpower - used by Louise to convince the Chinese leader to be cooperative."

","I postponed re-watching this movie, as I did not want to ruin the sense of magic and mystery that it had left me with when I first watched it in the theatre.<br/><br/>But after seeing Blade Runner 2049 and watching Villeneuve's other earlier work, I figured the movie probably really was as good as I first felt it was and should hold up under repeat viewing.<br/><br/>It certainly is a different story, the second time you watch it. The movie doesn't offer exciting twists, so much as requiring you to see the whole thing to fully understand what you have seen. And of course, that understanding brings a different perspective upon second viewing.<br/><br/>But it holds up, the aliens are alien, the sound design is otherworldly and the characters give the actors something to do, although I would have preferred a bit more depth from the supporting characters. However, Amy Adams could carry the movie on her performance alone and luckily, she doesn't have to.<br/><br/>My one issue with the story-telling is the level of exposure the main character appears to need (and thus the audience along with her) to come to her realisations, but it's not grating and doesn't diminish the experience too much.<br/><br/>Don't watch this if you're looking for exciting aliens sci-fi, do watch this if you like a through-provoking piece that doesn't mind following some of the tropes while still telling a wholly original story."

"tabuno","9","0","0","12 January 2019"," A More Leisurely Scary Communication with Aliens
","11 November 2016. Amy Adams stars in this psychological, space-time mystery. While not as compelling or engrossing as Interstellar (2014), Arrival has the same thrill of the new, unusual, and the unknown. Perhaps on the same level as the more claustrophobic Barry Levinson's Sphere (1998), Arrival brings with it a more personal, intimate backstory similar to what Manhunter (1986) accomplished with its parent-child interaction crime-thriller starring William Petersen of CSI. What makes this movie special is its expansion on the alien theme and how we communicate. There is the visual from Wavelength (1983), a sci-fi movie about alien beings and a couple's attempt to help them escape from a secret government station. There is the variation on a communication angle somewhat related to Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Whether or not the recent election of Donald Trump as President of the United States might fundamentally alter the impact of the likely storyline of this movie in terms of this country's response to such an alien situation is hard to figure. Unlike the singular hardcore response found in Phantoms (1998), Arrival offers up a more convoluted response. Arrival presents experiences similar to the sci fi classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Epoch (2001) of which Arrival has many similarities. In some ways, Arrival has the same tone and unworldly presentation as the remake version with George Clooney in Solaris (2002) but with an even a more soft touch. In a fashion, Arrival is the reverse of Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) that instead of the aliens having come and gone and humanity going to them, in Arrival the Aliens appear and remained."
"WalkdenEntertainment","8","0","0","9 January 2019"," A great Sci-Fi film has landed on Earth...This is not a drill...
","In case you have never heard of this film, Arrival is an alien film without the over the top action/chaos such as in films like Indepence Day. Arrival will require patience. This is a visually stunning film and I suggest to the audience to be patient and enjoy the clever and creative shots. Fans who have previously seen Sicario will be able to appreciate this director.<br/><br/>Lucky enough, the movie trailers for this film showed very little of what the film is about. The only tag line we have ever heard is ""Why are they here""...<br/><br/>The film opens up with Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams) who appears to have just given birth to her daughter. We are then shown their life, progressing quickly through a moving sequence. Then we flash to present day where Louise is a expert linguist and lectures professionally.<br/><br/>While she is teaching a class it is soon discovered that earth will change forever. People panic when multiple spacecrafts land on earth. Louise is shortly requested to join (and lead) an elite team to investigate further.<br/><br/>Amy Adams provides an outstanding performance (no surprise here, duh!) but we are forced to put up with a couple of characters that really don't hold any major purpose in the film. There are many moments where I even question Jeremy Renner's role- I felt he was some what wasted as an actor.<br/><br/>Arrival, I must say is a top sci-fi film. As an audience we have questions from the word go and to top it off, the viewer's questions only pile up as the movie progresses. Even when the film is over you will still be thinking about it- seriously, give it the next day or two. But is that a bad thing?<br/><br/>After thinking about my total score for this review for a couple of days now, I'm pretty sure certain things with the film's plot (and ending) simply just don't add up. But then again, I remind myself.... it is a sci-fi film after all.<br/><br/>7.8/10

"LogicIsEverything","Null","6","20","21 November 2016"," What a dumb, lame and clueless crap again
","This awful film almost drove me crazy. It was perhaps the most ridiculous and stupidest Sci-Fi film ever made in this genre. The graphic design on The heptapods, the so-called ""Aliens"" were the stupidest and most disgusting creation so far on the screen. I strongly suspected that such kind of crap was inspired when the stupid screenplay writer(s), the director and the graphic designer ate at the seafood restaurant, or when they visited the aquariums, saw those octopus and star fish, then decided to draw up such ridiculous crappy combination and made them into what we saw in this film.<br/><br/>I have to point out here again, with those so-called alien hands which could only ejaculate black ink as being their language and to communicate, they are not yet evolved advanced enough. With their star octopus sucking star fish like hands, there's no way they could invent tools or machines to build anything, albeit their space ships. The most and the least they could do are suck crap like the elephant trunks, sucking or spitting crap. There's no way they could build anything.<br/><br/>But the most disgusting smoke screen is that they used these stupid aliens just to tell another you've-seen-thousand-times plain story. Mother loved her only daughter but she died, so the mother could never get used to it and moved on. She was tortured day and night and obsessed with the memories of her dead daughter, anywhere and anytime, she just couldn't get rid of her dead daughter's images. We didn't see anything that could prove her unsurpassed reputation as a leading linguist....<br/><br/>Then the American government sent in an Army Colonel to call for her service when the mysterious aliens and their spaceships hung over all over the Earth's countries air space. The colonel supposed to treat her and other scientists, specialists like the lifeline to solve the international and national crisis, yet he just showed his rudeness, impatience to them, not the way around; which was also a very bad scenario among other stupid arrangement. Why she answered to him as a superior and Sir him all the time is beyond me. And this so-called number one choice of linguist could only inspired by her dead daughter's images and memories to solve almost anything and everything she failed to understand.<br/><br/>But no matter, the funny outcome of this film is she found her true love from one of the specialists who has faced the unknown danger with her. She married that guy and had a child again, all the nightmares were gone. (this paragraph you could treat it as a minor spoiler). The invasion of the aliens only gave her a chance to be alive again. An Arrival of a new child is actually what this stupidest sci-fi film really wanted to tell about, and forget those octopuses, people!!"
"ThomasDrufke","10","6","20","11 November 2016"," Story of Your Life
","The one thing I always look for in science fiction films whether they challenge our current viewpoints on reality, humanity, and time. Arrival manages to do all of these things and more. It's yet another masterful job of directing from Denis Villeneuve.<br/><br/>I have seen all of Villeneuve's feature length films except for his first, but I think Arrival may be his best work to date. Yes, that includes the beautifully tragic Incendies. And the gripping and visceral, Prisoners. Or the twisted Enemy. And even last year's hit, Sicario. Villeneuve brings the best qualities from all those films and brings them to one of the best sci-fi films in recent memory.<br/><br/>What makes Arrival so impressive is that it never forces the audience to take a leap of faith in logic or principles. You know from the very beginning that it's going to be a grounded story told in a slow-burn style, and it delivers. I was never sitting in my seat hoping for a groundbreaking twist or a shocking death, I just let the story be told. And it's quite the story.<br/><br/>Amy Adams stars as a linguist who begins to work with the military once 12 massive and mysterious shells appear hovering around different areas of the world. Adams is expectedly amazing and balances vulnerability and strength so incredibly well. The film also balances a surprisingly human story with a global scope well. I knew the original title for the film was titled ""Story of Your Life"", but I can't say I expected such a grand idea to feel so personally important, especially for Adam's character. But this balance, was what I enjoyed most about Arrival. It makes for some surprising and satisfying reveals later on in the film.<br/><br/>The entire sound department and production design team also deserve a ton of credit. Sometimes you forget how important sound is in films, whether that be a score, random noises, or the lack of sound altogether. I can't tell you how impactful the sounds in this film have on setting the tone and feel of each scene. Equally as important are establishing the visuals appropriate for the tone you're going for. The cinematography by Bradford Young as well as the production design from Patrice Vermette deserve some serious recognition come awards season.<br/><br/>Arrival in many ways is an extremely important film right now in our world. It exemplifies what we can do together if we overcome our differences globally. That togetherness is something the film tackles in a refreshingly unique way. Normally, when sci-fi's attempt to tell a story about a potential alien invasion, Hollywood chooses to focus on merely America's side to things. Rarely do we get to see the entire world have to work together to overcome whatever issues the film presents, and that was pretty cool to see. For me, this film is not only important but groundbreaking. Some of the storytelling devices Villeneuve uses to convey language, communication, love, time, humanity and many others are unique and gratifying to see in this particular film. Go see this.<br/><br/>+Villeneuve does it again <br/><br/>+Adams deserves an Oscar <br/><br/>+Use of sound and visuals <br/><br/>+Unique <br/><br/>+Global and personal <br/><br/>10/10"

"anandrajeev979","10","4","12","25 November 2016"," Straight Down a Sci-fi Masterpiece which works due to phenomenal work by Adams as well as a different story that compels you to think
","Arrival is a movie I will easily give 10/10 and perhaps more it there was more points on scale. Let's break down why this film works. Firstly we have the incredible Amy Adams and her performance is absolute terrific.Other Cast including Renner has done great work especially there were some people not familiar to sci-fi but we actually good. Each Moment of Amy Adam is perfect. Her skills are so good that you will love her.As a linguistic professor she killed it. Now the score of the film composed by Johann Johannsson is really terrific and by that I mean its haunting , captivating and a perfect fit to the situation presented j this wonderful movie. Thirdly and most Importantly it's the sci-fi we all have been waiting for. Sci-fi genre in Hollywood is now very common and in that too I think alien invasion are even more common. Every time just huge aliens arrive and humans fight them with all their power but that's not the case here. Thats why Ariival is exceptional. So Basically Huge 12 alien ships called ""shells"" have stationed themselves around 12 positions over the world and a gate opens after every 18 hours. So US Military contacted Louise(Amy Adams) and then begins the epic journey.Before that we must know that she lost her only daughter to cancer. So She and Jeremy Renner's Theoretical Physicist character starts working together to decipher their language. She is successful to have contact with them and starts having some flashbacks after that. Upto this point the story is woven so wonderfully with Breathtaking Cinematography. Aliens are hetapods due to their appearance and Ian(Renner) even name them Abbot and Costello. As Louise began to understand their language more completely , other nations are willing to attack them .Once Louise ask them what they want- they reply offer weapon .Similar nation receive answer like use weapon.So China declares war on them within 24 hours. US military also plant a bomb inside their ship t attack them . Unknown of the bomb Louise and Ian goes inside only to find some weird message from them. After the timing of bomb approaches Costello goes away and Abott saves Ian and Louise by throwing them away. They both wake up in camp and quickly figure out they want to offer something that perceives time differently which they called weapon.Quickly Louise understands something and go to them again even though now they are more higher in the sky after the attacks but they do not leave. They send a small ship for Louise and when Louise goes back inside everything becomes clear. Costello says that Abott is dying and when Louise asks them why are they here, they say they want to help humanity by giving them a gift which is their language as their language has the ability to change perception of time whose flow is linear for us and not for them.In exchange they want Humanity's help after 3000 years. Louise quickly understands her flashbacks are in fact future happenings and that she can understand her language and also understands various small things that accounts for what happens.She realizes she needs to stop Chinese general and others to stop them attacking the aliens. She quickly sees a visions where she meets the General in a celebration and he shows her his number and also says her his wife dying words.Louise then contacts him in present to spot the attack once and for all. After this all the ships disappear as they have given their gift. Ian confesses his love for Louise and she sees again visions of her with her daughter and Ian. This way the movie ends and this is how its great.The Director has done a great or far beyond great work to prepare this masterpiece.It will never be forgotten and hailed as a modern classic. Now apart from this I can ARRIVAL is best sci-fi after gravity , inception , interstellar and others. So Naturally it will get Best Picture Nomination at Oscars.Also I think it can clearly get 6 Oscars in total and that's just predictions 1. Best Picture - Maybe first sci-fi to win this title 2. Best Score - I think it has very high chances here 3. Best Adapted Screenplay - Definitely a strong contender here 4. Best Director - Maybe it can grab this 5. Best Actress - Amy Adams already has had 5 nominations and she can easily win here but I think she will have competition from Natalie Portman's portrayal of Jackie Keneedy 6. Best Visual Effects - Jungle Book and Doctor Strange are strong contenders but this can have a chance"

I couldn't have been more wrong. This film hardly had any action, but I was still on the edge of my seat the entire time wondering what was going to happen. That's how you create a quality film. I haven't seen any other movies from Denis Villeneuve before (such as Prisoners or Sicario) but I will most likely be watching those films in the near future if they're as good as this was.<br/><br/>Everything about this film was sensational. The plot, the acting (if Amy Adams does not receive at least a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars, I will be severely disappointed), the haunting score, cinematography, the twists, the aliens, it was just overall excellent. The messages that the film has as well are so timely, and are exactly what we need at this time. I really hope that this film does well at the Oscars because it deserves it!<br/><br/>This is a film that I could watch over and over again and not get sick of it. Fantastic 10/10"

","After the recent rash of mindless/pointless ""blockbuster"" sci-fi (Batman vs Superman anyone?), this is like a veritable gale of fresh air! <br/><br/>A first contact movie with believable struggles to bridge a gap in communications, understanding, motivations, technology, you name it. . . everything came into play. Brave but flawed characters without the usual over-acted good/bad/mad/funny guys. Just humans trying to deal with a genuine out of this world situation. <br/><br/>The plot is very clever (I'll say no more than that), and leaves you wondering right up to the jaw-dropping climax. <br/><br/>The only downside was the tired plot device of America / The West being the good guys, and Russia/China/The East being the (irrational) bad guys. If you can ignore that, you are in for one hell of a treat!"
"abouhelier-r","10","4","12","16 November 2016"," Another Close Encounter
","Arrival scored big at the weekend box-office and is muscling its way into the awards race. It has been almost 40 years since Steven Spielberg made Close Encounter to the Third Kind. That is not a Spielberg film that people tend to revisit the way they do Jaws, Raiders or E.T. In its time, though, Close Encounter cast a spell of majestic awe that still reverberates through pop culture today. This film with its obsessiveness and mystery, its spaceship of light that seemed as big as a city; made the prospect of an extraterrestrial visit look as wondrous, eccentric and spectacular as we imagined it might be. <br/><br/>Amy Adams is the film's quiet and luminous heart. Jeremy Renner's role is rather modest but he also seems to understand that, while Amy Adams draw on her gift for making each and every moment quiver with discovery. The actress is alive to what is around her, even if it is just ordinary, and when it is extraordinary the inner fervour she communicates is quite transporting. She is more respected as an actress than bankable. The film isn't a sequel nor is it a superhero film, it is not an Alien invasion film like Independence Day Resurgence that basically exists as an excuse to blow up stuff. Sci-fi isn't just for boys. Amy Adams is front and centre in this film, a performance that surely owned her all this Oscar buzz. The film also gives her character a personal tragedy to live with and a one that grounds the fantastical story in human emotion. As a woman, I really do believe that there is a genuine emotional storyline that can speak to women, either mothers or daughters. <br/><br/>This film has been made by the godly gifted director: Denis Villeneuve, who crafted Sicario and Prisoners. He manages once again, to ground this story in a hyper- realistic way. By hooking us with the news of spaceships hovering over Earth in the most random and unsensational way possible. Denis Villeneuve builds our anticipation with great flair. Discovering what the Aliens look like, sound like and how they communicate is the dramatic heart and soul of the picture. That kind of suspense is pretty rare these days. Plus, this film has an obvious poetic grandeur. The images are stately and vast, with an almost super-earthly clarity. <br/><br/>Indeed, there is a pleasing circularity to the structure of this movie and also a circular logic to it. True to its title, Arrival makes an absorbing spectacle of the initial Alien set- up. Though the Aliens don't quite have personalities, there is still something tender and touching about them. There are also, frankly, elements of familiarity. The sounds they make, and the way they look. The point being that even if Denis Villeneuve is a bold and brilliant filmmaker, when it comes to this subject, Spielberg's vision is hard to get away; it still somehow infuses everything. Finally, this notion that if you learn a new language it can rewire the way you think and that the Alien language is their big gift to Humanity is beautiful. Add to it that when learning this language, then you are able to rewire your brain and it actually alters the nature of time: it is mesmerising. The film ties it in with *SPOILER ALERT* a back story that forms the action about Louise and the daughter (in a prologue) who she watched grow up and die. <br/><br/>Overall, like all the best sci-fi it has something pertinent to say about today's world, particularly about the importance of communication and living in the moment. An ideal that shouldn't need any translation. It grips you with the strength of its ideas and the quality of its execution."

","Arrival is a profoundly affecting, deeply philosophical love note to humanity and all of its strengths, when the word needs to hear it most.

"JohnJay85","10","4","12","14 November 2016"," Non-Linear Time
","This is a brilliant film that is deservedly sparking a lot of interesting discussion about its themes. <br/><br/>A lot of reviews, however, are ignoring what seems to me to be the defining facet of the film: a narrative that deliberately confuses past, present, and future, and that can be constructed as linear in multiple ways. Looking back, the opening monologue gives this away, with Adams musing about the limiting structures of time and about being unsure of beginnings and endings. As the film goes on, certain scenes seem clearly to be either flashbacks or premonitions, but this clarity gets disrupted toward the end, as we are left to wonder if Adams' daughter's life precedes or follows the alien arrival. On my viewing, it seems that this ambiguity is precisely the point.<br/><br/>A lot of reviews are trying to organize this film as a linear narrative with instances of either recalling the past or seeing the future, but this language itself remains trapped in a notion of linear time (seeing forward or backward) that the film is trying to disrupt. The film hints at this paradox in a number of interesting moments: the daughter's name as palindrome, the ""future"" conversation with General Shang in which Adams nonetheless does not recall her past conversation with him, the ways the alien language is subtitled ('Abbot process death', if I recall correctly). One might even say the film is actually about the limits of language (or at least, human language): its structure is rooted in a sense of linear time that is itself a product of language (hence the reference to Sapir-Whorf). The film never quite gets at 'how' the alien language moves its users beyond linear time, but this seems to only reinforce the film's ideas about the limits of its own mediums, language and narrative (the latter of which necessarily moves from beginning to end). This film also presents an interesting contrast to Interstellar, which felt far more confident about language's capacity to grasp a radically other form of existence (for example, the aliens existing in certain 'dimensions').<br/><br/>As an aside, there is an interesting irony (intentional or otherwise) in making the Chinese the bad guys. Verbs in the Chinese language do not inflect, meaning they do not change to indicate past, present, or future tense. It seems that in reality the bad guys might have been best-positioned to figure the whole thing out!<br/><br/>Anyway, go see this film, embrace the confusion, and then see it again."

","Reading through some of the other reviews, it's apparent that many people don't understand what science sci-fi is; this movie was, to me, quintessential science fiction. If you're expecting a movie that doesn't make you think too hard while entertaining you with lots of mind-bending special effects and action this isn't the film for you. On the other hand, if you enjoyed movies like Contact, A.I., Gatica, Ex Machina, Interstellar, or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, then you're likely to enjoy this film too. <br/><br/>Another reviewer, 'Bikesloth', summed the movie up well: ""The point of this movie is NOT ABOUT ALIENS, it's about soul searching and reaffirming that it's the quality of life over the quantity of time that we humans spend here."" This movie uses the arrival of alien beings and the question of their purpose only as a vehicle to explore the much more personal question of whether we'd chose to live our life the same way if we knew in advance how it would end. Good sci-fi should make us think, both with our heads and our hearts, and 'Arrival' succeeds at both."

","This is an intelligent, entertaining and powerfully emotional movie about an international close encounter of the third kind. The film's catharsis released a flood of emotion in me - it's that good. Definitely worth seeing. The Canadian director straddles the art-film and commercial film worlds. As a commercial enterprise, the film is unusual in that it is devoid of guns, explosions, chases, fistfights and the other tropes of alien visitation movies, that it has a female protagonist, and that gives precedence to feelings of love and loss over those of terror and aggression. Can't say enough about Amy Adams' performance. The score by Johann Johannsson adds immeasurably to the film's effectiveness."

","Incredible film, but I didn't expect anything else from Denis Villeneuve. And Amy Adams carries this cast on her shoulders with her performance, I wouldn't be surprised to see some award nominations next year for this. A very thought-provoking, intelligent film about alien contact that doesn't rely on explosions or an action hero to get its point across. And with a superb ending and important message, I HIGHLY recommend this film to you, along with Hacksaw Ridge this weekend. If you want something loud, an Independence Day or some cheesy 90s action flick, this won't be for you. This is more Contact, or Close Encounters. And probably the best film score I've heard all year."
"alindsay-al","8","4","12","11 November 2016"," A great interesting sci fi
","This film has been getting rave reviews everywhere I have seen and i have now seen arrival and I really enjoyed this film. The premise of the film sees an expert on languages recruited by the us army to possibly communicate with an alien threat. Amy Adams plays Louise the expert on languages in this film and she is fantastic in this film. She is easily the most interesting character in this film and the character that you care about the most. She is a pretty tragic character and you really feel sympathy for her as the film progresses but she is a strong character as well. Jeremy renner is really good in this film and adds allot to his character that just makes him a likable guy that works very well with adams in this film. Forest whitaker is good in this film as the army colonel, he is a fair character that adds a sense of realism to the film. This Is also the same for all the characters in the bunker and from the other nations that add to this film. The story has a really interesting take on the typical alien invasion that ha me surprised and really interested. There's a twist towards the end that gave This film a real uniqueness to it that I really liked. However, the film ha very little resolution involving the aliens and I found myself with more questions then answers at the end of the film. The script was great it has some great dramatic moments and dialogue in it that makes you care about the characters. Also the film has a dry sense of humour that does work especially for renners character. The style of the film is absolutely gorgeous, this film has the best cinematography of any film This year. But this film has incredibly slow pacing. At times it does work because it gives it's characters more time to develop but it does make this film seem longer then it actually is and drags. Overall this is a really good film that is definitely worth seeing."

","Another year, another highly anticipated film from acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve, the director of ""Prisoners"" and ""Sicario"" is back at it again this time in the science fiction genre with ""Arrival"" starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. ""Arrival"" based off of the novel ""Story of Your Life"" follows expert linguist Louise Banks played by Amy Adams, who during an extraterrestrial invasion is contacted by the U.S. military to try and decipher their alien language, trying to find out what their purpose on earth is, do they want peace? Do they want war? Or maybe something else? Well that's for Louise to find out, but ""Arrival"" isn't really about that, it's a love story, it's a sort of coming of age story, a film about healing and revelation, beautifully told by Denis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer. ""Arrival"" doesn't quite measure up to other works from Villeneuve, but it stands as one of the best science fiction films of the last 5-10 years."

But Arrival is clever, contemplative and dreamlike, and not short of surprises. Amy Adams is wonderful and her character carries the entire film. In fact, for a film about aliens, the overwhelming theme is of humanity. The main message is one that is extremely important to me - we are all in this together and communication is the key."

","Arrival may be marketed as a creepy alien invasion movie, but rest assured, Arrival has more in common with offerings such as 1951's The Day the Earth Stood still, Contact or The Man from Earth than it does ID4, or something of that ilk. <br/><br/>Arrival is the newest output from Denis Villanueve, if you are not familiar with his work, think of Christopher Nolan, if Nolan knew how to compose a beautiful shot and write endings.<br/><br/>Amy Adams stars as the brainy linguist, brought in by Uncle Sam to attempt to figure just how in the hell to communicate with the alien race, who have inexplicably appeared out of the night and seem to be happy to more or less loiter in a number of creepy looking spacecrafts all over the planet. <br/><br/>To get into plot points would be quite spoilery and therefore we'll suffice it to say that Arrival is a brilliantly crafted film with visually arresting camera work and a haunting score.<br/><br/>At this point I'm comfortable in placing it into the top 5 of 2016."

","Alien spacecraft suddenly appear and hover menacingly over twelve locations around the world. A team near a spaceship in Montana composed of the U.S. military, scientists, other experts and, of course, ever helpful politicians, attempts to determine what the aliens want. Linguistics expert Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is part of the Montana team. It soon becomes apparent that the aliens are an extremely advanced culture and that they have a message for humanity. Whether that message is hostile or friendly, or can even be understood, is a matter of debate among countries and individuals. One loose cannon could bring an end to humanity.<br/><br/>Villeneuve is one of my favorite directors. His film Incendies, one of the best I have ever seen, is a hard hitting and masterful piece on the tension between hate and empathy, force and choice, control and liberty. In Arrival, Villeneuve applies his signature style to the genre of science fiction.<br/><br/>Arrival challenges the notion that advances in technology are always better than the fundamentals. This enthralling and potent film combines star power with amazing graphics, a gripping story, wonderful themes, a memorable conclusion, intriguing sound, compelling dialogue and of course a great director.

","Louise Banks (Amy Adams) loses her daughter due to illness. She's a linguistics professor when alien ships land on earth. Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) asks her for translation help and she convinces him to join his contact group. She is paired up with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They are one of twelve teams around the world in contact with a separate spaceship. The aliens use a circular smoke-like writing system. Eventually, China leads several teams to confront the aliens.<br/><br/>This is a change from the action-oriented sci-fi movies. It asks questions and challenges the audience. It's a mystery sci-fi. It is smart although I wonder if it could be even smarter. The reveal is nicely done. I want the writing system to be more profound and more easily connected in some way. The obvious comparison is the message in Contact and solving that message was a great revelation. This film is more murky and mysterious. The general sense is understandable but there needs to be an ah-ha moment in the audience translating the alien language. I can't give away any of it. Amy Adams does some good work. It's a beautiful film both visually and thematically. It's another solid film form Villeneuve."

Many may see this as quite an astounding sci-fi movie with a unique plot, outstanding cast, cool CG, and eye-catching visuals.

","SPOILER<br/><br/>What initially was supposed to be a linguistics based movie, turned to be a thought experiment (with shaky foundations of course, since it is a thought experiment!) about non-linear time! The entire movie is based on, arguably an extreme exaggeration of the sapir-whorf-hypothesis about the linguistic relativity (The way language affects our perception of the world). So essentially it is also about emotion and what it means to live if we already experienced time, both the past and the future! Somewhat like Eidetic memory(not a good comparison but somehow came into mind). When I first saw it, I was disappointed with the ending and thought that it was so random Time-travel stuff at the end. After pondering upon it for a while, I understood that it was a thought experiment trying to interpret what it means to experience something. Questions remain but still a brilliant thought experiment.<br/><br/>A few things were impractical like just having 2 scientists and a bunch of soldiers headed by a captain deciding almost everything and also plenty of time-paradoxes but still a very interesting thought experiment.

"nathanb-martin","10","3","8","1 March 2017"," The Beauty of Human Life
","Arrival is one of the most brilliantly written films that I have ever seen. When I initially saw the trailer for this film, I assumed that it would be a pointless sci-fi movie about aliens invading Earth, humanity's struggle for survival, and the realization that we are not alone in the universe. However, I found that Arrival actually focuses more on the beauty of human life than it does on the struggle to communicate with aliens. The writer of Arrival did a beautiful job of making the audience believe that Louise was currently suffering from the loss of her daughter when the movie began. But it is not until the end of the movie that viewers realize that Louise's daughter has not even been born yet. I have not had a movie surprise me in a long time as much as Arrival has. At the end of the movie, Louise is given the ability to see into future. Because of this, she foresees that she and Ian fall in love and have a baby girl together. But Louise also sees that their daughter, Hannah would die of cancer, and Ian would end up leaving her from grief. In the last moments of the movie, Louise is faced with the question of having Hannah, knowing that Hannah would ultimately die from cancer, or finding a way to not have Hannah and spare herself from future pain. Louise asks Ian, ""If you could see your whole life ahead of you, would you change things?"" Ian replied, ""Maybe I'd say what I felt more often."" The movie leads you to believe that Louise decides to have Hannah, even though she knows that Hannah will be taken from her. This is what is so beautiful about this movie to me. Life is short and busy. We as humans become consumed by work and stress and we take the time we have with one another for granted. We do not know when death will part us from loved ones. But Louise is given the gift/curse of seeing the future and knowing the pain she will endure by losing her daughter. But because of what she knows is coming, she is able to make the most of the short time she has with Hannah. She saw her daughter was worth having even if she could only hold her for a short time. The beauty of human life is that it is short. But with the time we have we can hold the ones we love. We feel pain, excitement, sadness, loss, remorse, happiness, longing, and joy. These are all things that make us alive. The tragedy of human life is that we miss all these things and we wish our lives away until one day we look back and realize that we didn't make the most of the time we had."

","I'm shocked to see how much hatred there is towards this movie in the reviews section when the general rating is actually pretty good and not only on this website. Maybe this is the type of film that you either hate or you either love. I love it, so it's really hard for me to even thought about bashing it so much. What bothers me about all the bad reviews is that most of them try to destroy the film and the experience of watching it without even given true and valuable reasons of why it is in fact so ""terrible"". Most of the reviewers seem to have a problem with the representation of the aliens, with how long it was, how slow it was, how many holes it has. There are a lot of complaints about the inaccuracy of linguistics of people that probably have never even study linguistics. I have. I happen to have a major in linguistics. And I think is beautiful to come across a movie that deals with something so relevant to our species as it is language. Every interaction scene with the aliens felt incredibly powerful to me. Conveying a message is not just based on sharing the same semantic and lexical structures. Is about movement, expressions, is about contact, whether this could be achieved psychically or by other means. Emotional contact is extremely important in language. Those scenes were my favorites. The relevance of the moment, of giving yourself to the moment. This movie deals with fear, with confusion, with pain. But it is no a simplistic fear to the unknown, it is now a simplistic fear to get hurt. It is about us, about who we are and how we can understand that through the understanding of others. Maybe this is not a movie for people that believe science is the core of society or for people that believe in the idea of aliens with extremely advanced technology that can only come to earth to show off what they have. It's not a movie with actions sequences and spaceships flying around. And I love it, I love it precisely because of that. I guess is a movie for people that believes in love and hope as powerful entities, beyond the idea of scientific power. It's about feelings, it's about humanity. It's not perfect. I agree that secondary roles felt at times irrelevant and yes, I would have love to see more about the language and how they manage to understand these creatures. But this movie does not pretend to give an explanation to every single detail, for a lot of you that may seem as a weakness in the script, a mistake, for me, that feels like it was done on purpose. There are a lot of unanswered questions, but you know what, I rather give my own answers to those questions and feel the experience. It is an experience. It's so sad to realize that so many people didn't get that. Anyway, watch it, feel it. Enjoy it. If you don't like it, that's OK. But there is no need for the hatred.

The whole movie is centered on Louise. It takes almost the whole movie to get that she's able to perceive time in a non linear way and that at the end she's the one instrumental to unite Earth.<br/><br/>To people saying they didn't get the purpose of the aliens, I don't understand if you watched the movie or not. The point for the aliens was for the world to get together in unity as humans and put aside the differences, it's not that different than Star Trek in that sense (if you don't know what I mean with that, I'm sorry for you, and I suggest to go and watch everything about Star Trek and you'll get what I mean!).<br/><br/>If you like movies were you don't completely understand what's going on, this is the one.

It does not need any action sequences, it is all about life, language and unity that bring to the twisted concept of the overall plot development with several hints throughout the entire story, further surprising audiences to view it from different fascinating ways. Amy Adams gains respects for her brilliant performance as a believable thinker and expert communicator while her emotions are handled well in order to engage the entire structure of the film. The theme song ""On the Nature of Daylight"" in both the opening and ending of the movie, as well as scores composed by Johann Johannsson enhance the the atmosphere of the film especially the thrilling suspense of invasions, the horror moments during the contact and the emotional depth on life perception. The arrival of the extra terrestrial amazes viewers on how creatively a science fiction may diverge from its generic aspects and link to life - telling us that life is a journey without destination and to live as if the answer is, even if you have known everything about the future."

How predictable.<br/><br/>The basic premise was ""if we all spoke the same language we would all live in perfect peace"". People who speak the same language have being killing each other throughout history.<br/><br/>The other part that bugged me was the portrayal of the aliens being super tech advanced and WAAAY smarter than us. Why couldn't they figure out how to speak the English language? It should have taken them nanoseconds. Yes I know that would have ruined the story.<br/><br/>The movie tried REALLY hard to be profound but I left the theater thinking ""meh"".<br/><br/>Amy Adams, Forest Whitaker and Jeremy Renner were great as usual."

","It's the end of the world as we know it! A much discussed and sometimes feared story has come true which, honestly, always sounded a bit ridiculous to actually happen in the real world.<br/><br/>I am, of course, talking about this new sci-fi drama Arrival"" where mankind is greeted by huge alien spaceships in the sky who seem to be coming in peace wait, did you think I was referring to Trump becoming the next leader of the free world?<br/><br/>But yeah, these two events have a very similar plot summary so it's only fitting that I had the chance to experience them in the very same morning.<br/><br/>Directed by Denis Villeneuve – the man behind Prisoners"", mindbending Enemy"" with Jake Gyllenhaal, Sicario"" and currently filming Blade Runner"" sequel –, one could expect Arrival"" to be a thinking person's sci-fi. And one is not wrong.<br/><br/>It is a 116 minute slow-burner all heavy on atmosphere and light on explosions or any quick thrills. <br/><br/>If you wish a quick reference to any recent well-known movies, the result is a bit like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar"" crossed with Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life"". <br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis's Contact"" (1997) would not be very far either, because Arrival"" also focuses on fragile yet brave female protagonist whose quality acting is one of the main pillars carrying the whole experience. The other one would be overall atmosphere, deliciously dark and ominous. Some will like it, others will probably find it depressing and maybe a bit slow for their taste.<br/><br/>I haven't read the award-winning short story by Ted Chiang that Arrival"" is based on. Wikipedia says that the major themes explored are determinism, language and Sapir-Whorf hypothesis which sounds mighty dry and mostly sci-fi geek friendly. <br/><br/>So it's nice to witness movie makers adding some mainstream appeal which comes mostly in the form of Amy Adams's great performance. <br/><br/>She truly holds the movie together as a woman going where no-one has ever gone before. You will believe her hesitations, the tears, and also the silent determination when the going gets tough. <br/><br/>This kind of role is tricky because of the need to play it out mostly alone, often in close-up where every detail and tone has to be clearly seen and felt. Think Matthew McConaughey's mighty turn in Interstellar"" but decidedly less showoffish.<br/><br/>So it's mostly Adams's one-woman-show, and a quite rare chance to see her doing something memorable and worthwhile on screen. She accepts too many decorative pretty girl roles, even in more ambitious projects. <br/><br/>The all-male supporting cast is good too, especially star players such as Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker. <br/><br/>As stated above, I don't know the original story but ""Arrival's"" message is rather spiritual and not ""dry"" at all. Essentially it is a reminder that mankind's future depends heavily on our ability to understand and connect to the world, rather than attacking and overpowering everything we find foreign or downright alien. <br/><br/>It's a call to rise above the inflexible ego-based mind the western society so dearly values, and to find balance with our intuitive side.<br/><br/>Overall, Arrival"" is a good movie although I wasn't especially happy with the final act which seemed rushed. It felt like somebody grew impatient near the end and wanted to add something impressive"" just in case the people were not happy with this slow-moving tale. <br/><br/>I do not want to talk about it here in detail but, for me, it lessened some of the movie's overall impact. Mostly because there was not enough time to play it out as properly as the stuff that had come before.<br/><br/>But yeah, if you are into more intelligent sci-fi and don't prioritize explosions, Arrival"" is good to go."
"matthewhforrest","7","3","8","29 November 2016"," Well made but serious suspension of disbelief
","Great cinematography and most of the dialogue was solid. There are some glaring plot issues that you don't need to look into too deeply to reveal = SPOILER ALERT = ..... It asks us to accept that these aliens are way more advanced than us (spacecraft tech; interstellar capabilities; non linear time sensing capacities etc) - and yet believe they would need basic language teaching. Even if you disregard the fact that they would already know the teachings (as they know the future! - so upon meeting they already will have had those lessons and know the teachings); they are so advanced they would have detected our crude communication via TV/Radio etc and would have learned all earth languages prior to the ""teacher"" meeting them. It of course then means she has no teaching role in the movie and kind of kills the plot. But it is an inconvenient truth all the same. Also the sacrifice of the blown up alien would be preventable (they would know the future and so have been able to stop the incident) - but it somehow served as a SECOND COMING sacrifice to humanity and so am sure that even though it was predictable and therefore almost certainly preventable (precog style) - it could well have been put in as a Jesus v2.0 sacrifice. <br/><br/>Another slight plot issue is that the father of the child is not in the ""flashbacks"" (turned out to be premonitions) even though she would surely know who her future husband is (as well as future daughter). Of course, it had to be that way as showing who that is (will be) would give away the fact she sees the future (when we are led to believe we are seeing flashbacks)...<br/><br/>I don't think it was as gripping and realistic as Contact. It was still well worth seeing as it felt very credible until it moved into the realm of supernatural."

","I was surprised to see the difference between the high ratings from the critics, and the modest box office receipts. Having seen the movie, I am satisfied.<br/><br/>The film makers have created an uncompromising adult sci-fi classic. This movie does not have the loud music and continuous explosions of today's blockbusters. It is not about gung-ho marines on a bug hunt. It is not about a fantasy adventure in another realm.<br/><br/>Overpowering aliens suddenly appear on earth. It is the task of the experts to learn how to communicate with them. You can only understand their intentions by providing the linguistic bridge between species. <br/><br/>It is not useful to communicate by numbers. That only tells you that there is a compatibility in the sciences. The movie makes it very clear that there is ambiguity in any attempt to understand intent. A weapon can also be a tool. <br/><br/>This should be obvious when you realize that humans often use the same terms (e.g. freedom) with very different interpretations and intentions.<br/><br/>There is plenty of drama in the movie. The eerie appearance of the aliens crafts. The alien environment of a radiation suit. The technological marvel of the alien craft. The sinister response of the hard men in the military and CIA. The bomb attempt against the aliens. <br/><br/>Above all, the movie highlights the disunity and enmity among human nations.<br/><br/>In the end, the linguist (Amy Adams) solves the puzzle. Using her rudimentary grasp of the alien language to receive a message from the future. Thereby, saving the day. <br/><br/>A far greater achievement than the mere mastery of anti-gravity.<br/><br/>On a personal note, the linguist demonstrates free will when she chooses to get married and bear a child. Knowing that a tragedy will befall the child. <br/><br/>To those who don't get it, you're not in Kansas anymore."

"noloxtreme","6","3","8","16 November 2016"," Does not live up to the hype
","Unfortunately Arrival does not live up to the extreme hype. From the critics ratings you would believe that it's the 21st century Citizen Kane or Godfather. It isn't. While I did not dislike the movie, it is enjoyable enough; but saying this movie is better than Interstellar let alone Contact is way off the mark. My wait for a very good science fiction movie since Interstellar and ex-machina goes on.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is about communicating with another vastly different species, akin to us communicating with ants, as an example is certainly an intriguing premise; but the premise to me was not profound enough to have me thinking about it after leaving the cinema, it wasn't even enough to keep me engaged in the movie for the entire length of the film.<br/><br/>To me really good science fiction is not really that much about the characters. For example, I don't consider star wars to be science fiction and Star trek to a lesser extent, because they are character driven stories, whereas science fiction it's about the environment, and a particular concept that acts on the characters and is bigger than the characters. The star of the show for Interstellar is the concept of ""interstellar-travel"" and the implications of faster than light travel. The star of the show for Contact is the concept of humans coming into ""contact"" with an alien species in modern times. But really the intriguing part about contact is the realism of the contact. You can imagine people really acting and reacting like that to such an extra- ordinary event. The main focus isn't Ellie(Jodie Foster's character).<br/><br/>Arrival does not work, like the aforementioned movies, because the movie is too character focused because the premise is really not intriguing enough to hold together an entire movie. Whereas in ""Contact"" deciphering the communication with the aliens was just ""a part"" of the whole, not the entire premise. Not only that, the tension was literally manufactured. The deciphering of the alien language was not exciting enough, it turned out to be these circle ink-blots. Okay, so what. What other incites of the universe or philosophy are we gathering from this? And the tension was completely manufactured. Because Contact was right. Any communication with a sentient intelligent species while it would take time, it would be based on the universal language of science and mathematics. 1+1 is always equal to 2. Any alien that shares this universe with us, is under the same laws of physics, therefore such statements will always be true. Even if you talked to primitive humans, you can easily grunt and point to fire and say ""hot"" and they would understand what you're talking about. <br/><br/>What that means is that establishing communication cannot be the entire premise of the movie."

"dennis_chiu1","Null","3","8","13 November 2016"," Arrival is a nice departure
","""Arrival"" is a departure from mindless sci-fi summer action films. Inspired by science fiction writer Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of Your Life,"" this film is an intelligent take on how the Earth would handle first contact if 12 alien vessels appeared around the world.<br/><br/>This is the first film I have seen from director Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies""; ""Prisoners""; ""Sicario""), and what I can say after watching ""Arrival"" is that he is a solid director. He has the confidence to pace a film slowly at first, and then build intensity as the material progresses. He also has a good eye for shots and working with cinematographer Bradford Young (""Selma""; ""Pawn Sacrifice""). And, he is one of those directors that allows actors to portray intelligent characters with quiet voices, and allows the impact of their ideas to turn up the volume.<br/><br/>Mr. Villeneuve is ably assisted by Amy Adams (""American Hustle""; ""Enchanted"") who turns in a fantastic performance as Dr. Luise Banks, a linguist that is tasked with communicating with the alien visitors. It is a layered performance, where Ms. Adam's speaks with a dull affect and fierce intellect. Her emotions are not worn on her sleeve, and we see her communicate through the intensity of her eyes and her breathing.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner (""Hurt Locker""; ""American Hustle""; ""The Town"") lends a quiet, steady supporting performance, as theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, who is the more tender character of the two scientists who lead teams to determine the intent of the aliens. Mr. Renner and Ms. Adams work well together.<br/><br/>The last person I want to note is writer Eric Heisserer, who adapted Mr. Chiang's short story into a feature length film. Based on his previous work, ""The Thing""; ""Final Destination 5""; ""Nightmare on Elm Street (2010),"" I would not have guessed he could pen such a subtle film, which proves he is a true writer, one who can avoid the dictates of modern attention spans.<br/><br/>After a summer of mindless entertainment, I found ""Arrival"" to be strong film, and a nice reminder that you don't have to dumb down entertainment to be successful, unlike running for President of the United States."
"TheDonaldofDoom","6","3","8","13 November 2016"," And the point is?...
","There are a lot of things I like about Arrival. Mainly, the way it tackles translation between its alien species and humanity. Films would usually gloss over that sort of thing but that's what Arrival focuses on most. The sci-fi stuff here, the non-linear communication, the way the humans slowly piece it together- that's clever. Humans face problems working it out, mainly countries like Russia and China not cooperating with the US and that adds more problems as those countries train their weapons on the alien ships. The ending, also, delivers a satisfying explanation to what it is the aliens are trying to communicate.<br/><br/>But it's also in the ending where Arrival breaks down. The film spends most of its runtime on the communication problems so you'd expect an amazing outcome. But you don't fully get that in Arrival. The ending is clever and moving but not enough so to justify spending an hour and a half building to it."

","It is SO GREAT when real, quality science fiction actually makes it on screen. It is SUCH a rare thing. This movie is great. If you read - in particular - quality, modern short science fiction, then this movie matches the best that you can take away from that experience. I've heard science fiction described as: taking one or a few ideas in science, extrapolating them, requiring some suspension of disbelief from the reader as those ideas are explored in a novel. This actually goes beyond that, but in a very good way. The aliens are clearly so advanced as to put us in the place of ants in comparison. Their science and technologies are relative magic to us. (Something Arthur C. Clarke would appreciate.) But it's not cheesy magic: it's wonder, yet believable. Along the lines of the wonder everyone must admit to when faced with the question of: how is an unbelievably complex consciousness - which seemingly has no explanation other than a metaphysical one - how is that connected to the mundane physical flesh and gore of billions of neurons in a brain. And without spoiling anything, the talk of time and faster than light travel (or not...) turns into a conclusion here that DOES require a good helping of ""suspension of disbelief"", but: the movie earns it. Plus - the cinematography, special effects, acting, sound, music: all terrific, and all fit together into a beautiful whole. What a pleasure to watch..."

Life is simple, huh.<br/><br/>This contain strong spoilers, but this is for those who did not understand the movie and genuinely want to.<br/><br/>THE ""FLASHBACKS"". ----------------- The apparent flashbacks you see in the beginning of the movie are neither flashbacks nor flash-forwards she's having at that moment. The movie just shows you the future and tricks you into thinking she is thinking about her past. But those thoughts and her are still disconnected. Only the watcher will see that there is this connection and the watcher places this events in the past, as the movies intends to. In the now, she does not give any clue about mourning. She doesn't seem very happy at into the now, but actually it has nothing to do with the future yet.<br/><br/>WHO IS THIS GIRL I KEEP SEEING? ------------------------------- By the middle of the film, you notice that as soon she is into the mission and approaching the Aliens, she is starting to feel weird and have the flashes. She is opened up to communicate, and she then start to have the actual flash-forwards, because the aliens start this process. Up to this point, the ""flash-backs"" we were tricked into thinking they were this, were not happening to her. But now they start. And it gets stronger inside her while mission carries on. When she definitely meets the alien inside its dome, she now is given a gift to see the future. She uses that future information to give humanity a fate in that particular situation (with Chinese leader) and she knows fully now that the girl is her future child that will die from cancer.<br/><br/>MARRIAGE FALLING APART ---------------------- She learns within the process of knowing the future, that her husband will leave her, because she will reveal too soon that the child is going to die from cancer. The guy, apparently a strongly firm steady and centered guy in the action, is actually a emotionally fragile and weak parent. With her passing the knowledge to him that she will eventually die, he can't cope it with the reality, and leaves the family when the girl is around 7 years old. (Although we have seen that the girl will actually die in her late teen years). So the husband, the guy, doesn't accept the loss, and moves on selfishly - even when the event is already years ahead. A weak and emotional broken party.<br/><br/>HER EMBRACING OF THE FACTS -------------------------- So when the aliens go away, Dr. Louise is now fully aware of the future. That she will have written a best selling book, that she will have worldly recognition of her work. But she ultimately makes a choice: She will not change anything. She has loved the child already, she know the girl will have cancer, she accepts it. She doesn't prevent anything from happening. The only part that we are not told is that, when she makes a decision to inform her now husband that she knows the future and the child will die, it is considered a mistake she have had done, but certainly she doesn't know yet on how this will develop - thus it will be a ""mistake"" on her part. Nevertheless, she won't change anything. Also, she is not aware of 100% of things in the future (that is why she makes this single mistake).<br/><br/>This movie is about love and loss and human beings. It has nothing to do with aliens that much. It's a movie that will help us understand how tiny and insignificant our mediocre lives are, and what we think is under our control, it is actually not. <br/><br/>This movie is on par with Butterfly Effect (1) and Inception. Interstellar breaks too many physics rules to be considered a better movie, but Interstellar is in fact much of a block buster, with massive physics mistakes (there is no way one can survive being sucked by an even-horizon).<br/><br/>Well, I hope you reconsider this film. Watch again and see what a masterpiece it is. Get your gears going faster and you will understand.<br/><br/>Cheers."

It was outstanding and explained a variety concept in an interesting way. Story which is adapted from a short story was mind blowing because of its story structure. Script had interesting elements in it and it was narrated in a non-linear pattern which sometimes might complicate the entire film but superb direction saved it.<br/><br/>2.)Amy Adams and Jeremy - Amy is the central protagonist and she acted well without any flaws. In short she was a showstealer and she succeeded in portraying her character. Jeremy didn't have any challenging role but he was one of the main characters and did his part well.<br/><br/>3.) Background score- Outstanding and marvelous background score. Its one of the main component of the movie and it really helps the narration to get feel. Viewers are able to feel the characters only because of its soothing background score. I am happy that it got nominated but it should have won because it deserves it.<br/><br/>4.)Vfx and cinematography- Vfx was too good and it helped in giving mind blowing visuals on screen. Cinematography was equally good.<br/><br/>5.)Variety Sci-Fi movie Negatives- 1.) Complicated narration- Narration was complicated at it will take time for people to understand. Only after discussing you will realize the entire plot clearly because it was too complicated and they could have reduced its complicated narration.<br/><br/>Overall- To sum it up its one of the best Sci-Fi movie i have ever seen. It took me time to digest the whole plot but then after sometime i understood everything. Those who say bad about this movie might not have understood its concept.

","Oh man, this one was so good. Better than expected, for me, and I had high hopes to begin with. It was adapted by screenwriter Eric Heisserer from Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of Your Life"". Since its release it has grossed more than $196 million worldwide and been nominated for (and won) multiple awards, which is no surprise at all. It is as cerebral as it is fantastic, all the while dealing with some very relevant and sobering flaws of the human race and politics in general. It manages to be heartbreaking, mystifying, and chilling, with strong characters and a plot that makes you ponder long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>** SPOILERS! **<br/><br/>The most interesting thing to me about this movie is how much the tension between our countries is more worrisome than the mystery of why these aliens are here in the first place. We — with our finger always hovering over the trigger — are a much greater threat than any outside source could be, and yet we're always using that other finger to point the blame. The vagueness of the aliens' arrival is enough to raise the hair on the back of your neck, but it's nothing compared to what we ourselves are capable of. The reactions that people have to the aliens' arrival — rioting, looting, self-immolation, calls for initiating violence — seem so natural for the state of our culture today that it's nauseating. And the miscommunication between countries and leaders — the feeling that we're just involved in a big game of telephone — is exasperating.<br/><br/>The film does an amazing job of making the alien ships as epic as possible — they are these looming leviathans, hovering over the ground effortlessly despite their massive size. They are both terrifying and awe-inspiring, and the swiftness of their silent arrival only adds to the dread. And yet when we see the aliens themselves — these floating, almost delicate, sea creature-esque beings that are quickly dubbed as ""heptapods"" for their seven limbs — I felt nothing but awe and curiosity. The interactions between Louise and the beings is just almost spiritual, in a way. There's a deep connection and seeing her commitment, her full force of dedication to understand them, is beautiful. You almost feel jealous in a way of her privilege of getting to know an entirely new species.<br/><br/>The language aspect alone is enough to keep you deeply invested in the plot. Watching someone decipher ANY foreign language is interesting enough to me, but when that language is being burst forth in a swirling, inky smoke from the starfish-like limbs of an unknown alien species, I am 100% sold. Louise comes to find that they do not communicate verbally, but rather in these complex, circular symbols that actually are sentences with no structural beginning or end. Absolutely fascinating.<br/><br/>The flashbacks to Louise's life with her daughter — and her daughter's untimely death — are absolutely heart-wrenching. They are understated and yet pack such a powerful, emotional punch. There's a scene where Louise holds her hand up to the invisible barrier between herself and one of the aliens holding one of its 7 hands up and during their moment of connection there's this sudden and intense flashback to Louise holding her baby daughter's hand and it had me instantly in tears.<br/><br/>The special effects were used smartly — not to overwhelm or show off, but to add a punch where it was needed. When the aliens push them out of the ship when the bomb was about to go off is one amazing example, and when Louise goes up into the ship alone and is almost suspended in liquid, hair swirling around her, in slow motion fascination while she learns about their true reason for coming to Earth so good.<br/><br/>And their reason is just mind-blowing. They are coming to Earth to give humans the gift of their language, which will allow them to change their perception of time. They know that they will need the help of humans in 3,000 years, so they have come to help us now. We realize that Louise's ""flashbacks"" are actually her visions of the future, her being able to see the life she will share with Ian (who she is just now meeting), and the tragedy they will experience with the death of their daughter (which will result in them splitting up when Ian finds out she had knowledge of the daughter's death all along).<br/><br/>This shifted perception of time is what allows Louise to save the entire project — when China decides to give the aliens an ultimatum after it is believed that the aliens have threatened warfare, Louise is the one who is able to see into the future and know what she needs to do to get them to back down and listen to her interpretation of the aliens' message. The tension while she pieces together these snippets and evades her superiors to accomplish this is awesome.<br/><br/>The majority of the score — composed by Jóhan Jóhannsson — is a wonderfully done addition to the movie, but I am mostly partial to Max Richter's one included piece, ""On the Nature of Daylight"", which has actually been used in quite a few films but is a brilliantly haunting piece of music all on its own (we've had Richter's album, The Blue Notebooks, on repeat in our house for years now).<br/><br/>I feel like I could go on and on here, but really one of the most fascinating, sobering, awe-inspiring movies I've seen in a while. Highly recommended."

I was impressed with the alien language aspect and the visuals of the creatures and ships. Yes, there is a twist, but it's presented in a realistic way rather than trying to trick you. Forest Whitaker I think was trying to do a Boston accent, but it was hard to tell since he would abandon it altogether from time to time. A great overall message, especially for the current climate. It poses far-reaching questions but leaves room for personal ones as well."
"deeparks-21125","9","3","9","12 February 2017"," Beautifully made
","Arrival is a fantastically smart Sci-Fi film that takes the run-of- the-mill 'Aliens land on Earth' plot and flip it on its head. Amy Adams delivered a masterful performance as a brilliant linguist with what seem like flashbacks of her dying daughter. She is chosen by the US Government to decipher an unknown alien language alongside a physicist named Ian so they can communicate with the one of 12 alien spaceships to figure out their purpose on Earth. As tensions rise around the globe, Louise and Ian are put under tremendous stress to find out why the aliens came to Earth.<br/><br/>The setting in Montana gives a stunningly beautiful backdrop for this incredible yet perplexing spacecraft. The environmental CGI is stunning yet just subtle enough to be believable and not distracting from the emotion and story line and the aliens are beautiful and surreal. Their squid like bodies and the way they write is scary and thrilling to watch. Louise's daughters story is heart wrenching as the flashbacks to watch the cut scenes are soft and feel as if you are stepping into a memory rather than seeing what's going to happen in the future. The score is beautiful also. The soft horns really set the mood and filter emotions to you through sound along with the visuals. It is perfectly balanced to enhance the film and to not be overbearing and distracting. The story is so well thought out and unique that every moment captures the audience's attention and keeps them on the edge of their seat wondering what turn is going to be taken next. It keeps you confused and disoriented along with Louise as she tries to fit the puzzle pieces together until it delivers one mind bending yet brilliant plot twist at the end, throwing a wrench into reality itself. There were a few parts that quite seriously irritated me though. Like the fact that a government official thought that a linguist could decipher and alien language from a short recording of a few weird noises. Sorry but not even the US government could be that naive. Also, the bombing of the spaceship literally made no sense to me. There were a couple of others but despite these perplexing events this movie is an incredible watch and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."

","I like it for the fact that it is using language as a backdrop. I am entertaining myself the concept of understanding of the fourth dimension, which is essentially time itself, will make us capable of maneuvering it. But still, this is an interesting concept itself. Superb acting from the leads and I like the character that she is portraying. After knowing the truth, or you can say the future, she doesn't choose to experiment what will happen if she deliberately tries to change it. Like what other films have been doing, they will try to test the limit of knowing the future. But in this one, she chooses to just embrace it, acknowledging that it is her fate. You might say that she doesn't choose to take hold of her life, but I would contend that with she chooses to enjoy the life as it is. Enjoying every moment there is with the loved one, even when she knows that her husband will leave her and her daughter will die. But that's how everyone's life will end up being, we either leave or die. <br/><br/>It is a poignant view of the world, but this might be the best choice after all. She made a choice and she honors it."

"alfredsmith","9","3","9","1 February 2017"," One of the best sci-fi movies ever.
","Science Fiction movies are so diverse. There are successful ones like the Star Wars series that I don't even regard as Science Fiction as it's more a fantasy. The science part of Science Fiction is overlooked far too much in Star Wars. I understand that when you go to see a movie you need to suspend disbelief but many ask you to believe in new laws of physics that make zero sense or forget evolution and allow aliens to look like humans. Then there are movies like ""The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951)"" and ""Interstellar"" that I regard as brilliant.<br/><br/>Arrival is most definitely in the latter group. Early on it is difficult to grasp where it's going but it gathers momentum quickly and the story is not only beautifully told, it's also thoroughly satisfying. It's clever Science Fiction. The aliens themselves were a great choice. Despite their appearance, animals on earth that are similar have complex nervous systems and behaviors, excellent vision, high intelligence and communicate with each other. Communication is the key to this movie as is linguist, Louise Banks played by Amy Adams. The plot revolves around her being recruited to interpret the alien's language. Amy Adams carries the movie. Much is asked of her and she delivers. I'm shocked that she didn't get a best actress Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" is beautiful, complex, and cerebral. One of the best Science Fiction movies ever."

","I really got into the basic plot of the movie and the part that language plays in it. It asked a lot of great questions at the beginning and figuring out how to communicate was well done, which earned all of the 6 stars I gave it.<br/><br/>What bogged me down was some of the melodrama that just has to be included in movies these days. I find it hard to believe that there would be such a rush with regard to aliens that have done pretty much nothing upon arrival. They didn't attack anyone. They didn't even really try to communicate in any way. They just sat there and let us come to them. I didn't understand all the stress and I certainly didn't get the whole bomb plot or responses from China and Russia.<br/><br/>The reveal at the end was pretty interesting too, but, once again, got bogged down with the feels as so many movies do. Imo, the language plot was good enough. We didn't need the added commentary on ""life"" etc., and that was a boring distraction for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed what with all the hype."

","Arrival makes me want to read the book on which it's based. The story is very good. It's the classic trope where extra-terrestrials land publicly and first contact is made. You brace yourself for a disaster since army men put themselves in charge as usual (a major reason why, in real life, aliens avoid Earth like the measles.) And where many writers failed to conclude their own take in a fulfilling manner, Arrival delivers the goods with a clever, emotional, yet simple narrative that explains all what we saw and still leaves a lot to our imagination.<br/><br/>The film thus owes most to its story. It does complement it with great visuals, and decent acting. On the other hand, it does suffer from being unnecessarily slow. Your patience will be tested at times, and is required for you to enjoy your candy at the end. As I said, it makes me want to read the source material much more than it calls for a future rewatch."
"Turfseer","5","3","9","10 December 2016"," Linguist saves nations of the world from each other, but no ""Kumbaya moment"" for her
","You never know what you're going to get with director Denis Villeneuve. I was not impressed with his political bias in ""Incendies"" but was pleasantly surprised with ""Prisoners"" which proved to be pretty entertaining. Now he's tackling sci-fi for the high-brow crowd with Arrival starring Amy Adams.<br/><br/>Arrival is similar to science fiction films from the 50s featuring an alien invasion and the obligatory American response. Villeneuve posits an armada of 12 obelisk-looking spaceships randomly touching down in different countries around the world. The one winding up in the US appears in an isolated area of Montana.<br/><br/>A rather grim Forest Whitaker plays US Army Colonel Weber who calls in linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to try and make contact with the aliens and find out what they want. The bulk of Act 2 involves Louise, along with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), attempting to decipher the aliens' strange language, circular images that appear before them like puffs of smoke. The aliens by the way are called ""Heptapods"" and can best be likened to giant jellyfish.<br/><br/>Be forewarned that those sci-fi aficionados who are used to a lot of action and derring-do on the part of a superhero or two, will be sorely disappointed here. Indeed, Louise's efforts at translating the mystery language is a long slog and only those who are appreciative of all the linguistic references will perhaps leave the theater satisfied. <br/><br/>Meanwhile the political aspect of the plot follows a familiar sci-fi trope—there is usually a progressive group (represented as Americans wouldn't you know it!) and a more reactionary one (featuring the militant Chinese General Shang who is inclined to attack the alien ship and ask questions later). When the Chinese linguists translate an alien word as ""weapon,"" their conclusion is that the aliens are belligerent and have not come in peace (Louise's belief, on the other hand, is that the word is more benign—translating as ""tool""). <br/><br/>The apparent mistranslation provokes an international crisis, with the Chinese now on the verge of attacking the alien ship and others countries following suit. Villeneuve is not content to leave us with the impression that the Chinese and other bellicose nations are not the only ones guilty of a committed jingoism. There is also a rogue group of American soldiers who desire to do in the aliens and at one point smuggle a bomb on board the alien vessel--only to have the explosion deflected (with Louise and Ian saved) by Abbott, one of two aliens aptly named after the iconic comedy team, Abbott and Costello.<br/><br/>Leave it to Louise to save the day when she finally figures out that the aliens speak in a ""non-linear"" language and are able to perceive time as an organic entity. What this means is that we're all in store for a ""Twilight Zone-like"" ending where Louise runs into General Shang at a cocktail party in the future and he instructs her to go back to the present, call him on this secret cell phone number and tell him his wife's dying words that no one else could have known. This convinces the present-day General Shang to believe that Louise is the ""real deal,"" has correctly understood that the aliens mean us no harm, and he orders his army then to stand down, preventing a guaranteed Armageddon.<br/><br/>It's all a wonderful ""Kumbaya"" moment for the nations of the world, but unfortunately not for Louise. She now realizes that all those earlier visions of her teenage daughter dying of cancer occurred in the future, and bravely decides to have the child with Ian anyway, even with the knowledge that things won't end up as gloriously as they did for mankind in general.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Whitaker and Renner have little to do in underdeveloped parts. Adams as the determined linguist certainly is acceptable but is saddled by the heavy-handed script, notable for its total lack of humor.<br/><br/>Villeneuve attempts to temper his happy ending of world peace with a bittersweet denouement for his heroine. But still the aforementioned ""kumbaya moment"" for the nations of the world is a disappointment (couldn't he have thought of something a little more clever?) Still, if your thing is linguistic puzzles mixed in with a touch of Twilight Zone, Arrival might just be for you. Others might not be so forgiving as this is for the most part, one decidedly lugubrious tale of sci-fi fancy."

","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I enjoyed Arrival. I thought it was well-made, with good acting and really nice visuals. The plot was interesting, with a couple of surprises. The final twist was artfully done; I bet not many people saw this coming. The downsides of the movie are slow pacing at some points, uninteresting characters aside from Amy Goodman's, and a really unbelievable view of science. Within just a few weeks, they go from zero to the ability to communicate complex ideas---even more, the Amy Goodman's brain is literally re-wired by the process? No way. I don't buy this, and I certainly don't buy the final twist about precognition. Of course science fiction depends on suspension of disbelief, but the suspension comes out of agreement between the director and the viewer; I felt the director hadn't earned my belief in his idea by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>For me this movie was visually and thematically similar to Interstellar, but Interstellar was more successful. My evaluation of this move is ""nice try""."
"LouisGur","10","3","9","2 December 2016"," Best science fiction film in years
","Arrival is a film that reminds me of why I love science fiction. It is a genre that on film, can be both terrifying and absolutely beautiful to watch. Take Tarkovsky's famous Stalker as an example. While it may seem odd to compare such a classic to this recently released film, I think it is absolutely fair. Arrival is a modern day masterpiece.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve is an absolute master of atmosphere. It only took me 10 minutes until I was stuck inside the world of Arrival. I was experiencing certain contact with the characters, it almost felt like I was around them rather than just watching them. The soundtrack and the absolutely stunning cinematography by Bradford Young creates this unique atmosphere that I have rarely seen in other films.<br/><br/>In some ways, it feels like Arrival is the science fiction film Terrence Malick would make if he ever did one. That is because you could say that the story in this film isn't about alien contact at all, but rather about humanity. It is the most philosophical film I've seen in cinemas all year and one that asks so many questions about us as a species.<br/><br/>It is also time for Amy Adams to get her well deserved Oscar. She has been nominated for an Academy Award five times now, why didn't I know this until yesterday? Her performance in Arrival is simply one of the best performances ever put on film. She is stunning as the main character. Jeremy Renner whom I usually despise was also superb and the two shared great chemistry together on screen.<br/><br/>Arrival is an intense and beautiful experience. There were some parts of the film where I was so scared that I could barely breathe. There were other parts where I was crying because of how beautiful this film really is. In other words, Arrival is a must see.<br/><br/>People will most likely draw comparisons between this film and Christopher Nolan's Interstellar in the future. Do not let that fool you, however. This is one of the best science fiction films ever made. I wish more directors were as gifted as Denis Villeneuve. I can not name five ones working today who are capable of making a great sci- fi film. This is what I'm looking for when I say the word sci-fi, not Marvel superheroes."

It focused more on the human side, that's not a disadvantage, it's just that I wasn't expecting Arrival to take this side.<br/><br/>Of course I wasn't bored while watching Arrival that's because I appreciate beautiful cadres and compositions.<br/><br/>But overall Arrival is totally recommended as it's the best movie in 2016 so far in my opinion."

"jfurena","10","3","9","26 November 2016"," An epic journey exploring time and the human condition.
","Arrival is the newest entry in the science fiction genre from director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) starring Amy Adams (Batman v Superman) and Jeremy Renner (The Avengers). The film follows Dr. Louise Banks (Adams), a renowned linguist professor, and Ian Donnelly (Renner), a theoretical physicist, as they work together to communicate with extraterrestrials that have arrived on Earth. The stakes are high as the two scholars race against time to uncover the reason for the arrival of twelve enormous, oblong, black vessels and prevent a catastrophic war between humans and aliens. However, this is no ordinary alien invasion bursting with violence and bloodshed. Instead, this story adapted by Eric Heisserer (Final Destination 5, The Thing) and based on the story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang focuses on the communication and rationality needed to prevent disaster. Villeneuve, with aid from cinematographer Bradford Young (Selma) and composer Johann Johannsson (The Theory of Everything), creates a vibrant, suspenseful world on the brink of global conflict. The vessels and aliens (named heptapods) have eerie, naturalistic sounds created by sound editor Sylvain Bellemare. The vessels sound like moving mountains, while the heptapods sounds like subaquatic creatures. These mysterious creatures have their own circular hieroglyphic written language that Dr. Banks must translate in order to dispel the tension and reveal the heptapods' true intentions.<br/><br/>Amy Adams drives the story with a spectacular performance. The long shots of Dr. Banks walking around the empty college campus post- invasion suggest the distinguished communicator has shut herself off from the world after the tragic death of her daughter. However, her curiosity and courage take center-stage as she challenges Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) and Ian to approach the heptapods using a humanistic approach instead of militaristic or scientific methods. This is emphasized when Louise erases a portion of Ian's mathematical equations without remorse to write the simple statement: ""What is your purpose on Earth?"" There are close-up shots of Louise and Ian as they venture into the strange vessel with their orange radiation suits. The camera focuses on their faces as they experience the fear of changing gravity, and their erratic breathing resonates as they approach the antechamber where the heptapods lie shrouded in mist behind a transparent glass barrier. Unlike her colleagues around the globe, Louise takes a simplistic, yet time-consuming approach in order to teach the heptapods English and understand their language. Her approach is criticized by Colonel Weber who wants quick results. However, she gains respect as she begins to understand and translate the language. As China and Russia threaten to start a war, Louise must uncover the truth behind her dreams and the alien language to prevent catastrophe in a shocking twist that only a small portion of viewers will decipher.<br/><br/>Arrival is an emotional, philosophical sci-fi film reminiscent of The Martian and Interstellar. Its use of the nonlinear storyline and ambiguous ending reminds us of Christopher Nolan's The Prestige and Inception. The beginning and ending of the film show a beautiful lake scene enhanced by the somber song ""On the Nature of Daylight"" by Max Richter. Villeneuve constructs a sociopolitical film on globalization, the media, and language. He creates a science fiction film based on people, not technology and highlights the importance of the humanities during a time in which the arts are under siege. The emotional story also explores time, life and death, love, and happiness. In one of the film's final lines, Villeneuve challenges the viewer with an ethical dilemma: ""If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?"""

"chrisolson-01223","8","3","9","19 November 2016"," ""Arrival"" - a Jungian psychological review
","The film ""Arrival,"" based on the ""Story of Your Life"" by author Ted Chiang, is a tale about the self-realization of an individual personality. Treating the whole story as an individual's dream or series of dreams, we can interpret it as a projection into drama of what a person undergoes who is integrating new information into a larger personality or individuality, a process that C. G. Jung also called individuation or the realization of wholeness.<br/><br/>The 12 UFO spacecraft, called shells, and the seven-legged aliens that they enclose, are self-symbols, symbols of the integrated wholeness of psyche which combines both what is behind and beyond time and space, on the one hand, and the perceiving ego consciousness conditioned by the time and space forms of perception, on the other hand. The numbers 7 and 12 point symbolically to completed creation (7 days of creation, 12 months of the solar year), meaning completed consciousness and entire personality. They also invoke the astrological (7 planets, 12 star signs) equivalence of what is above (the macrocosm or overall order of psyche) and below (the microcosm or human individuality). These symbols want to be understood by and fully enter into human life, as Jung describes in his book on UFOs and throughout his collected works. <br/><br/>As can happen, the confrontation with the self-symbols overwhelms the ego, projected in the film as the mainly masculine world at large, and causes it to fragment, close down and fall into isolated complexes that cannot communicate with each other. Each complex, depicted as a region of the world with its own language, has adopted a hostile attitude to the unconscious, unknown material that has penetrated consciousness in the form of the aliens in their mandala-like shells. Adoption of the hostile attitude, or turning a fearful face to the unconscious, causes misinterpretation of the alien's intentions and provokes the psychological disintegration.<br/><br/>By contrast, the protagonist Louise maintains an open and courageous attitude to the information arriving from the unconscious; in response, the unconscious shows a friendly and helpful attitude towards her. Louise is blessed with a resilient ego consciousness and a capacity to interpret and integrate material from the unconscious thanks to the help of the aliens, the personifications of archetypal forces in her dreams and visions, and a supportive masculine figure, Ian. She is assisted by the appearance of key archetypal symbols in the form of the eternal or divine child (a daughter she might have had in the past or might have in future) and the wise old man (General Shang). <br/><br/>The aliens give access to the unified world that lies beyond and behind the space-time world of consciousness but that also embraces it. Contact with the self-symbols gives Louise access to knowledge of her future, meaning her psychological potential, most often communicated by her daughter, symbol of the eternal or divine child. Critically, she sees an image of her future book, meaning her realized capacity to understand the aliens' symbolic language, which is another child of her own creation born of a union of masculine spirit and feminine relatedness and their joint generative power. She is also given access to a dream image of communicating with the key player, the at-first evil but now empathetic General Shang, who tells her how and what to communicate to him to resolve the crisis that has engulfed and threatens to destroy the world (ego consciousness).<br/><br/>Importantly, Louise is the only feminine character of any importance in a film dominated by anxiety-driven masculinity. She is surrounded by men who, with the exception of the scientist Ian, mistrust and fear the aliens and are prone to hostile action towards them. In the film, this power complex is epitomized by the at-first dictatorial and threatening General Shang, exploiting the Western spectator's mistrust and projection of evil shadow onto the Chinese nation and its allies. Louise's contact with this hostile if earthly Other, which is needed in order to reintegrate the split off complexes and to consolidate the ego so that it can integrate the new knowledge, is termed treason by the leader of the American military who seeks to violently repress it.<br/><br/>Shang approaches Louise in a dream as a kindly father figure who communicates the key information needed to reintegrate the fragmented consciousness. Shang, who has been transformed by hearing the last words of his dying wife from Louise, the source of feminine relatedness, is the archetypal figure of the wise old man who points the way to the ultimate solution of the problem, which is to withdraw the projection of evil onto others, be they alien or human.<br/><br/>Once Louise has restored order to the world, she turns to completing the work of bringing the self fully into the world through the individuation process. The final step is the chemical wedding or sacred marriage that will give actual birth to the divine child; that is, to a life lived truly and fully with an accepting attitude toward its depth, sorrows and joys.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" describes for us the self-realization of an individual. It shows in symbols what a human being can experience during an in-depth Jungian psychological analysis. It gives a feeling of what life can mean to someone who experiences and understands it symbolically. If that person is you, it means changing life into your life or, as Ted Chiang calls it, into the story of your life.<br/><br/>Chris Olson, Advanced Candidate, Independent Group of Analytical Psychologists (IGAP), London, UK"
"donegalcat","5","3","9","18 November 2016"," Decent premise let down by weak ending
","The film starts out with a good premise. A linguistics professor is asked to help communicate with aliens whose ships have appeared at 12 locations around the world. Amy Adams as the professor, along with a theoretical physicist played by Jeremy Renner enter one of the ships and make attempts to communicate with the aliens on board. This is the most interesting part of the film as the pair try to decipher the aliens communications.<br/><br/>But having established this interesting premise, one that is rarely explored in alien films, Arrival doesn't seem to know where to go next. It ends up with a weak and deeply unsatisfying climax with a cod-philosophical message about language, communication and world peace. And in a blatant piece of western propaganda, Russia, China and Sudan are marked out as belligerents willing to resort to violence as opposed to the Americans who just want to talk.<br/><br/>Amy Adams gives her usual one-note performance, with the same emotion she shows in all of her films. While Renner lacks the charisma or presence to step out of her shadow. Forest Whittaker and Michael Stuhlbarg are mostly wasted in supporting roles playing typically clichéd characters.<br/><br/>The film does look impressive with good visuals and excellent cinematography. There is a decent soundtrack and the film feels well put together. But scratch beneath the glossy surface and the film is vacuous and forgettable. The premise is ultimately wasted and cast aside towards the end leaving this viewer hugely disappointed."

I have a very personal reason this movie affected me like it did to which I will elude later. 10 minutes later my crumbly broken voice uttered the words ""wow"" just ""wow"". It's a long time since I felt like this since coming out of a movie. It was a unique experience.

That I tell u this movie is elegantly paced and deeply moving tells u this isn't your landmark destroying smash bang wallop cgi fest alien invasion movie. Independence Day this isn't. Amy Adams delivers a near perfect performance central to this very human story which uses the alien presence to highlight something very grounded we experience here as human beings. This is intelligent, confident, thought provoking, moving cinema delivered in a stunningly mesmerizing way. The themes this movie explore are very relevant to our times in fact all times. How we communicate with each other let alone with an alien presence becomes the more pertinent question. Understanding the language of emotion of appealing to the human heart is presented in a plot twisting stunning way. That we as humans have to understand that life's tapestry is not all how we wish it to be but that we understand all of what we experience in life including hardship, loss, love joy they are all part of the life we are given. And now the reason this movie resonated with me on a personal level. I lost my daughter over a year ago and I have to tell u no sermon, no priests religious words or prayer has provided me with the comfort or profound message this movie gave me. It's truly cathartic.

","There's nothing scarier than the unknown, yet the unknown is the only sure thing. All that's real is what has already arrived; luckily, the truth of love can never fully depart. Though time causes the pain of endings, the love we experience is always worth it. What does all this have to do with alien-invasion-drama Arrival? Everything. A visually mesmerizing, aurally overwhelming, emotionally disruptive, narratively surprising, and thematically pulsing sci-fi film for the ages, it's not to be missed. The setup is familiar: a group of UFOs appear over different cities all over Earth, and a small group of disparate humans must lead all humanity towards an understanding of their purpose. However, Independence Day this is not. More suspenseful than thrilling, it's high-minded science fiction whose slow and steady pace only emboldens its immense engagement. Think the best aspects of Kubrick and Spielberg: brainy ideas and complex visuals, mixed with spectacle and humanism. For example, on first entering the alien ship, we experience: characters' shifting sense of gravity, fear giving way to wonder then back again, the prescient difficulty of communicating across impossible boundaries. Villeneuve, who's becoming one of the greatest directors of our time, embodies such meaning into each of these moments. Even lines like, ""I forgot how good it felt to be held by you,"" carry meaning beyond their clichés. Its intelligent sci-fi style brought to mind Close Encounters, Tree of Life, Interstellar, and fourth film I won't mention. Just know that time and awareness are huge throughout, leading to a final montage that brought me to tears for the first time this cinematic year. Arrival is an absolutely stunning achievement from beginning to end."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" (2016) is without a doubt the best, most sophisticated and deepest sci-fi movie since ""Interstellar"" (2014). I was simply blown away first of all from the presentation (not the premise, which lets just say isn't very unique, but that is just at the beginning) and later the, well everything else. <br/><br/>The overall story in here is very powerful, not simple by any means and the one which i confess is a bit to hard to swallow at the end. It was sad but at the same time hopeful, and the reason for the arrival itself - no spoilers here - is amazing. Finally, a great sci-fi movie not about destruction. <br/><br/>Directing by Denis Villeneuve was amazing. What a scope and skill to show it. Like i said, presentation of this movie is amazingly good. Music was so haunting and so beautiful at the same time. Script wasn't predictable for a second. I loved each and every scene aboard the spaceship, they could have lasted longer. This is an ""aliens"" movie so smart and so plausible like i haven't seen since ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" - it is that good, it is not ""Independence Day"" by any means. Acting was also superb, with Amy Adams giving her probably the best performance yet.<br/><br/>Overall, i do believe that ""Arrival"" will be a major Oscar contender this year, because it is way to good to be ignored for its genre. It's so much more then just ""aliens"" movie, the one that is so sad but at the same time gives a hope and willingness to take what is the most beautiful and precious for a human being. Great movie and a pure sci-fi movie heaven."

","I can't think of any film with aliens which is non-fear based, which eant to help us as well. ""Close Encounters"", etc. is non threatening, but has no true meaning. Also, in order to fully understand this film, I had to watch it a second time. If you don't, you will miss at least some of the multi-layered stories being told. The part about her daughter, her precognition, etc. are pretty obvious. What took me in the second viewing was this: I came to the conclusion that when Louise is ""remembering the future"", for lack of a better term, time stops in everyone else's space-time continuum. In other words, several minutes may pass while she is thinking/remembering about her daughter, but time does not for the others. There are a couple of exceptions, but this is a primary part of the film that I missed the first viewing. Also, it grew on me the next time as well. It is truly brilliant, and without Amy Adams, I dont think it would have been as good; I don't care who else you can think of. The director said the same thing: he had to have her, or he wouldn't make the film. BTW, Stanley Kubrick said the same exact thing about Malcolm McDowell in 1970 before he began filming ""A Clockwork Orange"". Keanu Reeves absolutely flipped he liked this film so much. I agree. It is hard to top. I liked it more than ""Blade Runner 2049""; absolutely. I think Villeneuve is at the pinnacle right now. Even Ridley Scott has competition in this regard, and he produced BR 2049."

"Eric266","9","2","5","2 March 2018"," A Nearly Perfect Film
","I'm not really a sci-fi fan so I was not in a huge rush to see this movie. I can't believe I waited. It is simply a beautiful film about just how simultaneously small and large we are in relation to the universe. The acting is superb, the script is taut and the directing is on the mark. The special effects look realistic (which is rare these days with CGI so prevalent) and the storyline progresses in a smart manner.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is a linguistics professor named Louise. Jeremy Renner is a physicist named Ian. They are recruited by Col Weber (Forest Whitacker) when 12 alien ships arrive across the globe. The idea being they will be able to make contact with the aliens and translate their intentions. The aliens seem to have benevolent intentions, but of course the military and intelligence agencies have to justify their existence. There is also a renegade Chinese General who wants to attack the spaceships and possibly start a global war.<br/><br/>The ships are well designed. The reverse gravity affect was pretty cool. (The aliens bear a strong resemblance to alien characters on the Simpsons.) 
Eventually, Louise and Ian start deciphering the aliens' language which appear as smoky symbols on a glass barrier. This, too, was handled well as Louise starts to understand that their language consists of symbols and not letters like English. The movie does an amazing job of conveying how difficult it might be to communicate with other life forms should we ever make contact. The expressions the aliens use are misinterpreted and Amy and Ian have to rush to stop a global disaster. Throughout the film, Louise is having visions of her daughter. This is central to the plot and when you understand the non-gimmicky twist (another rare thing in movies these days), the movie takes on a whole new dimension. You can watch it a second time and see an entirely different film.<br/><br/>What I liked most about the film is it has a real easy going pace. The science is handled well and easily understandable. The actors are great and the concept of actually trying to understand another lifeforms view of reality was awesome.<br/><br/>I rated this movie a 9. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is some of the characters were extremely one-dimensional and just seemed tacked on to provide some contrived tension. The intelligence officer and some of the soldiers are an example. Otherwise, this movie was fantastic."

For nearly two hours her and the bland Jeremy Renner try and figure out what the aliens are saying, a ridiculous and boring plot that fails to make its substantial nature revealed. What happens next is a series of mind-bendeling reveals relating to time and space that don't fit anywhere into the story and leaves us with a rather bitter ending.

","I haven't written a review of this kind before but was so disappointed by the discrepancy between the high IMDb rating for this film and what I saw that I felt I must do so. The film starts in such dreary, muted colours that I had to pause it and set the screen brightness to vivid to even see some of the opening scenes. This type of mood setting seems to be popular now but boy does it make for a depressing Friday night viewing. Along with the visual settings I found I could not follow some of the dialogue as background music often drowned the actors voices out or in some cases the actors words were unintelligible. The pace is sluggish and the discoveries made by the lead roles were not evident to the rest of the cast or to many of the viewers I suspect. It is a voyage of discovery, but one where the viewer is kept in the dark even when the discoveries are made. A little bit of stereotyping is present has the usual military ""thickos"" doing all the bad stuff, more through incompetence than malevolence; so very passé nowadays when most senior military personnel have high academic attainments. If you read ""War and Peace"" but the author had left out the ""War"" part or ""Pride and Prejudice"" similarly edited you will have some idea of how this film progresses. There is a twist at the end but its impact is lost in the ennui that I felt. I couldn't wait to get to the end and head off to bed.

","No payoff for all of the slowness. <br/><br/>*** Minor spoiler plot points following ***<br/><br/>I really liked Enemy, I loved Prisoners, and Sicario is a masterpiece but Denis Villeneuve's Arrival misses the mark. <br/><br/>The ""twist"" basically invalidates the main character's reason for having the personality that she has throughout the movie. Arrival also makes the mistake of making this big science fiction first contact movie too much about the personal problems of the main character instead of making it about the subject matter at hand. Because in the end, with all of the time that was was put into so many flashbacks, it doesn't tie strongly enough into the issue of the aliens arriving on earth. Now I understand that the film makers might think that it does. But to me it's just a long drawn out sidetrack that is detracting from more interesting things that the movie could be showing. <br/><br/>Now from a purely technical standpoint Arrival is first rate. It looks and sounds good, but Amy Adams character doesn't add up. Jeremy Renner's character is really the only spark of life and personality in the movie but he doesn't get much of a chance to do anything with it. <br/><br/>I had high hopes for Arrival but, nope."

Upset I spent money to purchase instead of waiting for it to come on cable, Netflix or regular TV. In reflection this was like a soulless failed M.Knight S. like imitation film lacking charm or style. The movie falls flat and is actually a failure with an 8.2 rating? Captain Marks whom u will see little of is the only person of interest and that is because when u see his face u instantly know he is going to do something...eventually. Again the film fails, had they only shown more of Captain Marks and managed to have scripted and built a little suspense in his role around his actions. They could have cut many of the scenes with Amy Adams and made that happen. Towards the end of the film it is over the top obvious that u have not seen the husband so u know who the husband will be as the film has bored u so long, has to be near its end and it is too late to introduce a new character. <br/><br/>A slow slightly boring movie doesn't bother me if overall it has a great story. I have not acted since 7th grade when I faltered over memorizing my lines after a star turn in the 6th grade when a 3 person classroom play was accidentally aired locally by a group testing new equipment but if I had been inserted in the movie and acted badly stumbling over my lines, it would have added some drama and interest. All the immensely competent actors in this film looked and sounded they were all on a lot of Prozac! The dullness of the movie is related to both directional and screenplay issues. Amy Adams tries to create a mood and aura with her acting but she is just a person too much in their own head and not fully interacting with anyone around her. Too bad they put everyone else in the same head space. I believe the reviewers that actually watched the movie not just the trailers had to rate it highly on what could and should have been, not what the movie actually was!"

","Arrival (2016) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Excellent science fiction film has a linguistics professor (Amy Adams) being called in by the government after twelve spaceships appear out of nowhere. The twelve ships are scattered throughout the world but no one can communicate with them until the professor tries to break through.<br/><br/>Science fiction really isn't my favorite genre but there's no question that whenever it's done right you can get an excellent movie. ARRIVAL is a film about an alien invasion but there aren't any major fights. There really isn't too much action. Those wanting to see Will Smith blow up various spaceships are going to be disappointed because this certainly isn't that type of movie. What ARRIVAL is is a movie that tries to attack your mind instead of your ears and your senses. The movie doesn't try to be some blockbuster, although I must say that it's great to see it capture an audience like it did.<br/><br/>I'm not going to pretend that I understood every single moment or twist in the film but what was so great about the movie is that even though you've seen countless invasion movies, director Denis Villeneuve manages to grab your attention right from the start and bring you into the material and take you for a ride. The film has been attacked by some as being dumb but I'm obviously going to disagree with that. The movie works perfectly as a science fiction film but also as a mystery since the lead characters are basically trying to solve a puzzle before it's too late.<br/><br/>There's no question that one of the greatest things going for the film are its performances but the main focus should be on Adams. She gives an extremely intelligent and rather deep performance as Louise. I'm not going to spoil that various plot twists that happen since that wouldn't be fair to first time viewers but Adams is certainly wonderful in the role. One could argue that no one could figure out this language that the aliens are using but Adams really makes you believe the character and you can take this ride with her because you believe what you're seeing. Both Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whitaker are very good in their supporting roles as well as the various other actors in the supporting parts.<br/><br/>The special effects are another major plus. I really loved the look of the aliens and thought they were simple but effective. Their form of communication also works extremely well and I thought it was a fascinating way to tell the story. The music score, cinematography and all other technical aspects are excellent and in the end ARRIVAL really delivers a thought-provoking story."
"taz1004","8","4","15","20 January 2017"," For those who don't understand the movie
","I've read some negative reviews below and they just don't understand. They're criticizing the way Amy Adams tries to communicate and how our government reacted etc and the movie's point is that the aliens did that on purpose to unite the humanity. That obviously is necessary for humanity to help them in 3,000 years.<br/><br/>The plot is something scientific community was theorizing for many years and people who are not familiar with the concept may have issues comprehending it. I suggest watching it again. This is actually becoming popular movie plot as movies like Interstellar, About Time, and few others dabbled on but Arrival is the best adaptation of it.<br/><br/>One complaint I have about most science fiction movies that feature aliens is that they always assume the aliens have similar intelligence as ourselves. All aliens are just more advanced version of humans. Just look at our own planet, we have thousands of levels of intelligence from a chicken to a dolphin to a monkey to humans. One thing people need to understand is that suppose we someday venture into space and find an alien race with a dog's intelligence. That would be marvelous discovery but that alien race will not understand our behaviors or motives. So if an advance alien race who can travel space and time visits us, what makes you think you can understand their motives? The directing and acting were superb. I'm glad they didn't turn it into an action flick as this movie will be remembered for a long time."
"moviewizguy","10","4","15","16 November 2016"," An Affecting Tale of Humanity and Compassion
","I've been looking forward to this film since I read Eric Heisserer's screenplay nearly four years ago, previously titled STORY OF YOUR LIFE and adapted from Ted Chiang's short story of the same name. It was the first time I ever cried while reading a script, so to say I was worried the film wouldn't surpass my highest expectations would be an understatement. As you can tell from my rating, I absolutely loved ARRIVAL. It's easily one of the best films of the year and one of the most affecting sci-fi films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I've been a staunch supporter of Heisserer ever since I read his script, but back then, people only knew him for the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET remake, THE THING prequel, and (the surprisingly good) FINAL DESTINATION 5. Since then, he's proved himself of being a capable writer with HOURS and this year's LIGHTS OUT. But it's with ARRIVAL that shows how skillful Heisserer really is, and I think it's time we finally give him the credit he deserves... I guess having Denis Villeneuve direct your script and Amy Adams deliver a powerhouse performance doesn't hurt either.<br/><br/>With that said, I went into the film viewing it on a level most others wouldn't have until their second viewing. Despite knowing where the story was headed, the film remained compelling and emotionally involving throughout its runtime, and I cried buckets by the end of it. ARRIVAL is a thoughtful, poignant, and heady piece of work. It respects the audience's intelligence to put the pieces together themselves and involves themes regarding humanity and compassion that's very relevant, especially in the past few days.

","We do learn from experiences: good and bad. Also, we will succeed in life if we manage to look at life from all possible angles (figuratively). The more we are exposed to, the more successful we are likely to be. However, we need to be able to still in touch with our emotions and others'. In this challenging and engaging Science fiction film, we get to see how both rationales can stand next to each other, and they're all embodied in a character beautifully played by Amy Adams, who makes quite a comeback to solid acting after a couple of less than satisfying movies.<br/><br/>Here she is a linguist, one of, if not the best in the world. She knows her standing because she's trained herself to be the best; yet she is also able to understand how language functions, and how it has evolved, and most importantly, it can't exist without context and communication. This is what the movie is all about, and it's obvious from the beginning. Still, more than a few in the audience are going to be sidetracked by their own expectations and the very remarkable design of the film.<br/><br/>Based on a short story, the film is expanded both visually and thematically, involving the audience with its plot, and more importantly, with the level of execution by its director and its main star. Adams takes on the role, uses her eyes, voice, and body to convey all the emotions that are clashing inside of her. She tells her team that one must try different approaches to understand what the aliens want, that one must not give up. In the meantime, we are given flashbacks of her life and some dark moments that must have shaped who she has become. Not everyone of her family scenes are sad. There's much love and happiness in there, too. They're bittersweet, and somehow, they're connected to what she's trying to decipher.<br/><br/>Twelve mysterious spaceships, which somehow bring to mind the monolith in the 2001 movies are hovering in different part of the world, challenging each of those regions, taunting them with the possibility of something terrible on the future. Still, a few of the scientific teams break through, only to have a few of them end up tragically, and one of them set on starting what might possibly be, the end of the world.<br/><br/>Adams proves to be the key to the resolution of the mystery, and it's a bit of a shock to realize what is really happening, and how essential she is to making sure that things turn out o.k. Unfortunately, she must deal with some interesting variables: the political agenda of some countries, the unwillingness to trust each other, and the inability to have faith and to dream.<br/><br/>Circles are essential to the story. They come in all shapes and designs, and they are the way the alien species communicates with Adams and the other people around her. There's a bit of a competition between the scientists and the linguists, until they realize they need each other. Also, we get to see the creatures in some disturbing close ups which make us understand why humans are, to say the least, stressed because we are very limited in our beliefs and sometimes can't see beyond what is front of your face. They can't see that the aliens are willing to communicate, that they might share some similarities with the human race, and that they might need each other. In the tradition of H.G. Wells, the great Science fiction films work with both our feelings and our abilities to rationalize whenever possible.<br/><br/>Villanueve keeps you hanging and might test a few people in the audience who are expecting for something flashy and dazzling to happen. It does, it is electrifying to know that stories can still be told without resorting to a barrage of unnecessary special effects. This film has the brain, the heart, and the intelligence to treat us with respect and to even throw some philosophies for us to ponder what it is that we are doing with our lives, and how time is really more than anything a circle, a perfect shape that is all over us in the universe and we certainly learn to take it for granted. You won't after you see ""Arrival""."

","I like Amy Adams as an actress she is good at her job, her movies are not brilliant in my opinion and Arrival is no different.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 3/10 rating because there are some positive elements, the film score (half of it) is very good, the score by Johann Johannsson is different, it's experimental, catchy and unique, I have yet to become bored of the film score as I listen to it a lot on Spotify, not all of it is great, but there are some tracks that I love.<br/><br/>The other positive elements to this film are the decent performances and the atmosphere, this flick is very open, atmospheric and spacious, example the house that belongs to Amy Adam's character is very modern and is set in the middle of nowhere, the rest of the flick has wide open spaces, I like this type of cinematography. Cinematographer Bradford Young and Director Denis Villeneuve did a great job with that.<br/><br/>The story line of this alien flick is different than many other alien movies, Arrival is very serious and makes it clear that this is not one of those Sci-Fi comedies, Arrival is definitely a Sci-Fi Drama Thriller.<br/><br/>As an animal lover, I did not like the scenario with the bird in the cage, there are also many other things wrong with this movie. Many people may not agree with me, and that's their right, but I will still stand by my opinions.<br/><br/>As a Christian, I believe in the Bible and the Bible makes it clear that there are only 2 kingdoms, God's Kingdom and Satan's Kingdom. You could say ""It's just a movie"", but as a strong in faith Christian, my faith can't help but intervene when I watch some secular movies.<br/><br/>We see things from Linguist Louise Banks point of view. The US Army needs her to communicate with these Aliens that have just landed on earth, as the film goes on we see that these Aliens give her all sorts of information. Like I said, there are only 2 Kingdoms, if this were a real life situation, Louise would be getting her information from demons, clearly these Aliens are not God, so there's only 1 other option. I personally don't believe in Aliens, I do however find the topic of aliens interesting at times, and I recommend a Christian site that talks about secular topics like this, the site is ""Answers In Genesis"", they offer a biblical perspective on secular issues and topics.<br/><br/>Now, these ""Aliens"" tell Louise Banks of her future about her daughter Hannah who will have an incurable disease and will die before she even becomes a teenager. We find out the sort of plot-twist that those scenes with her and the daughter were not flashbacks, but were actually flash-forwards.<br/><br/>As the film goes on, a character named Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) expresses his love for Banks. Louise agrees to have a child with Donnelly despite knowing what will happen to the daughter.<br/><br/>I can see why this film has her decide this, the short amount of time to have and to show love, but this is not good enough of an excuse, Louise is being very selfish here, she knows that Hannah will die and with the information that Louise gets way beforehand she still agrees to have the child, the daughter will end up suffering and dying long before adulthood, how is that fair to the kid?! Also, Louise did not tell Donnelly the imperative information, she lied to him and that is also selfish, Donnelly leaving them wasn't right either, him leaving them was not nice at all and was so very wrong, but Louise Banks could've prevented all of that heartache, the best thing that she could have done is to not agree to have a kid with Donnelly and spare that poor child the pain.<br/><br/>One could say ""But every human will eventually have to lose a loved one"", yes but if you're given information like that, then you have to not be selfish by thinking about yourself and think about the situation of the person that would suffer an incurable disease, if you could prevent a loved one from suffering - you would, so in Louise's situation she could have prevented the pain of another human being, plus think about the emotional trauma the child would experience, she probably desired to one day go to college, e.c.t., and all of it will be stripped away from her.<br/><br/>This flick cannot be compared to the reality of humanity, humans are not going to get information from Aliens because Aliens do not exist, Scientists have spent millions of money for decades and decades trying to find alien life and there isn't any.<br/><br/>This movie is just what it says it is - which is nothing but Science Fiction.
The Bible never mentions aliens, there are no purpose for aliens, the topic of aliens is just a distraction from Satan's Kingdom to distract people from turning to God.<br/><br/>Arrival is just not a very good film, like I recommended earlier - listen to the Score on Spotify instead."

Luckily the trilogy was recovered after the splendid toy story 3 so the franchise is still holy but Arrival is one good movie. I think the protagonist are very similar because like Louise i believe woody lost a child too and that's why hes so protective of Andy.

How dare you? How dare you?"
"ctowyi","8","3","10","14 January 2017"," Close Encounter of the Interstellar Kind
","Arrival is one of the front-runners in this current award season and the hype is deserved. This is brainy sci-fi for intelligent audiences, which means it is not a bravura shoot-em-up- with-laser-beams in the vein of Star Wars or Independence Day. I would say it is in the territory of Contact, but thankfully without the kitsch sentimentalism. This is Close Encounter of the Interstellar Kind. <br/><br/>Linguistic professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is called upon by the military led by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) when a dozen shell-shaped spaceships appear at different locations on Earth. Together with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), she is tasked with interpreting what the aliens want.<br/><br/>That's it, saying anything more of the plot would ruin a profoundly unique and I dare say, spiritual experience. This is based on a simple ""what if"" scenario, teased out into a larger tapestry and then hitting the climatic note with such panache that you walked out of the cinema hall more in touch with life. Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer have adapted Ted Chiang's multiple award-winning short story, Story of Your Life, superbly. We are lulled into a state of awe, then once we are entranced by the strangeness of it all we are entrusted with multiple conceptions of what is right and normal. Villeneuve's storytelling is hinged on open-ended dialogue, quiet but tense scenes, dream- like cinematography and intensity exuding from characters in stressful situations. Not once does the story talk down to you, explaining difficult concepts through simplistic expositions. The narrative respects you enough to connect the dots (or circles) yourself. <br/><br/>The story isn't just a clever intellectual exercise, it also carries great emotional heft. It accomplishes it through Amy Adams' excellent performance. Her deep emotions of love and loss boiling just beneath her melancholic exterior is a beauty to behold. Louise Banks is our anchor in this strange world and it is through her we not only learn what the aliens want, but we also enter into her mind-space and see her life as a mother. <br/><br/>Despite some minor missteps, Arrival has so much verve that most people will just dismiss them. The whole exercise is stimulating, intelligent and thoughtful, with something wise to say about the human condition. We won't get many films of this caliber in a year so it would be wise not to miss it. Villeneuve has reached a new epoch in filmmaking with this and I can't wait to see what he does with Blade Runner 2049."
"pablo-73192","6","3","10","11 January 2017"," Review of Arrival:
","A linguist finds herself alienated and separated from her husband after the death of her daughter in an accident. Haunted by the memories of what has gone before everything starts to change for her after the arrival of twelve cone shaped alien spacecraft on the planet. Shortly afterwards she finds herself reunited with her ex as they are both chosen to act as the translators with the alien race. The aliens play with the former memories she has of her daughter as they start the communication process and the critical point of the film is when they enable her to have a vision of a future conversation she could have with a Chinese general in order to change the future time line. The film ends with the linguist reuniting with her ex through them both hoping for another daughter.<br/><br/>I will add the rider that some of my companions thought that the linguist has never had a daughter and has never been married and that the death of the daughter we see is part of her visions regarding the death of a daughter which she will have in the future. Although this particular interpretation was far too complex for me it just goes to show how confusing some parts of the film actually were."

"watersprinkls","10","3","10","23 December 2016"," Phenomenal, well thought out, enjoyable sci-fi film!
","What a wonderful film! I enjoyed every second so much. It was creatively put together in such a brilliant way. It's hard to praise this movie without giving small things away, because everything really just is a brilliant surprise. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This film is also very easy to watch and flows smoothly, making things easy to understand. This is why I think anyone can watch it! This may be the first time I'm giving a 10/10. <br/><br/>I just want to praise the fact that in the beginning of the movie it gives you some clues that you kind of just have to make assumptions about, and in the end it pieces it together in a way that shows you how carefully thought-out everything was... and how some things were there to fool you hahaha. It really is brilliant. <br/><br/>As a casual watcher of sci-fi films, I love films that invite fantasy yet logically provable in some way. I mean without logic, even if fabricated just for the concept for the movie, things wouldn't make sense and it'd seem ridiculous to watch right? This film does a great job with convincing you of how everything works with aliens.<br/><br/>I can't say i'm an expert on sci-films but I know a good one when I see one. This film totally owned their concept of aliens, made it their own, and carried it out masterfully. <br/><br/>I haven't felt this satisfied with a film in a while. I wasn't even the one who picked to watch this movie, I just briefly watched the trailer before going in. Totally surpassed my expectations!"
"asifahsankhan","8","3","10","22 December 2016"," ""Non-zero-sum game!""
","Who are they? Why are they here? What are their purpose on earth?<br/><br/>These are the fundamental questions asked in the new movie Arrival. Director Denis Villeneuve's newest film is a smart tale of mankind's first contact with aliens that boast a sophisticated narrative and nuances, great visuals, and strong performances from its small but effective ensemble cast. ""Arrival"" is one of these such movie treats; an intellectually intelligent Sci-fi that's highly likely to be regarded as a genre classic in the years soon to come. <br/><br/>Dennis Villeneuve (who has quickly become one of the industry's greatest current filmmakers), who here worked with screenwriter Eric Heisserer in adapting Ted Chiang's short story for the big screen, has created a Sci-fi event free of what you'd call large scale alien infused spectacle but instead filled a film with a quietly powerful narrative and ultimately stunningly moving centre that drives this unique vision to grand and near close to perfect Sci-fi heights. With all that's played out, a movie like Arrival about understanding aliens who communicate in a very different way than we do sounds pitch perfect for the kind of a week we've all had. After all, language is the cornerstone of our society, and we live in two very different Americas. To make things even better, the film is the latest in a string of successes by Prisoners and Sicario director Denis Villeneuve.<br/><br/>Centered around the intriguing prospect of Amy Adams language expert Dr. Louise Banks, whose battling to figure out a way to communicate with an alien race that has decided to pay earth a potentially deadly visit, Arrival's narrative is best left relatively unspoken about as its complexities will be enjoyed that much more by those that know only minimal details about where Villeneuve and his talented cast are taking us.<br/><br/>Anchored by what could well very be an Oscar nominated turn, Arrival rides off the back of Amy Adams central turn and while the increasingly impressive actress is ably supported by Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, Arrival really is her film.<br/><br/>Touching, thematically rich and visually robust (albeit a tad too sentimental in parts), Arrival is an ambitious, ultra-intelligent sci-fi drama, custom made for those who like a shot of 'smarts' with their popcorn — the film, dealing heavily with memory and loss, bound to get an emotional response from a handful of viewers. <br/><br/>Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker), a high ranking military official, pays Louise a visit and informs her that alien life has been found on these pods. He also informs her that he needs someone with her particular set of skills to learn how to communicate with these aliens and understand why they're here. With the help of scientist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Louise is to make contact with the aliens and find a way to break the barriers of oral and verbal communication to figure out what is happening. Meanwhile, Louise has memories of raising a daughter she never had.<br/><br/>""Non-zero-sum game!"" — a situation where one's win does not necessarily mean another's loss, and one's loss does not necessarily mean that the other party wins. But in Arrival it's all about using the Weapon Language, the Cornerstone of Civilization<br/><br/>Despite grand visuals, grey cinematography, and a triumphant score, the film's defining hallmarks are its strong narrative, its nuanced direction, and its beautiful acting. You might require some patience and dedication but you won't be disappointed — Have some wine coolers with this one — it's a terrific film!"
"midas-jacobs","10","3","10","21 December 2016"," One of Villeneuve's best films!
","""Arrival"" is based on the short story written by Ted Chiang, which is about a linguistic called Louise bank, who's hired by the army to communicate with aliens, that have landed on earth in these so called cocons.<br/><br/>The movie was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, because of one reason: Denis Villeneuve. I've seen nearly every movie of him, and the ones I haven't seen, I'll probably see in the near future. He is an amazing director, who pays attention to everything he brings into frame, and everything he brings into frame has some kind of meaning. In this movie that's also the case. Not as much as in ""Enemy"" for example, but it's there. At a certain point I thought the movie was going to be like ""Enemy"", because of one scene, but after all this movie wasn't as complicated. More on that later in my second to last paragraph (There'll be spoilers). He also, just like in the rest of his movies (e.g. Sicario, Prisoners), succeeds at building up tension. The scenes where Louise is trying to communicate with the aliens were always kind of tenseful, because you don't know how they're going to react. The cinematography I found to be gorgeous. The scenery, use of focus and lighting were all perfect. The use of focus was something that really caught my eye. It gave scenes a more dreamlike feel, when it had to, which kind of helped me to unravel the twist at the end. At those scenes focus was overused, but it worked. Those scenes also contained more close-ups to show the emotion of the actors, which made everything more effective. The use of colour was also handled well, which only made the gorgeous looking shots, look even more gorgeous. I found it to be a shame that Roger Deakins wasn't the cameraman for this film, but Bradford Young surprised me by doing something nearly as good. Young really captured the reveal scene of the spaceship very well. I think that that was one of my favorite scenes. The soundtrack in the background, the mist waving over the mountains, the camera movement. Everything was there to make the scene fantastic, and it was. The soundtrack was original and fitted the movie well. The CGI I found to be good at times but during one scene it didn't really live up to what the movie had showed previously. The ship and aliens themselves looked good, but there's one scene, I can't talk about due to spoilers, which didn't look good. <br/><br/>The acting was absolutely fantastic. Amy Adams gives again a wonderful performance. She gives depth to her character and you could really see the emotion on her face. You could see what she was feeling, due to the visual story telling of Villeneuve. There were a lot of scenes, where she just had to act, without saying a single word and we knew what was going on inside her head, because of Amy Adams wonderful acting. I really hope she gets an Oscar-nod for this performance, because it really blew me away. Her character was very interesting, but more on that in the next paragraph. Jeremy Renner also gave a fantastic performance. His performance was less spectacular than the one of Amy Adams. <br/><br/>SPOILERS FROM HERE.<br/><br/>The screenplay should also deserve an Oscar-nod for best adapted screenplay. The story was told in a weird – but good - way, whereby you get to care for the character of Louise. This was done by showing her memories of the future, mixed in with the stuff that's going on right now. This was such a creative way to build up a character that I was amazed by it. In those memories they used the focus heavily, like I've said before. The character of Louise really got fleshed out very well. The rest of the characters didn't really get the same treatment, but that's something very normal and something you shouldn't complain about, because Louise is after all the main character. I've also hear people say that Jeremy Renner's character is useless, and with that too I'll have to disagree. He indirectly helped with the character building of Louise and did also do some things himself to progress the story, so I don't see why he would be useless. Now something about the twist. Louise can see in the future. I found the twist to be kind of unexpected. I was kind of expecting some kind of answer in that direction, but not the answer we got. It was creative and something new. Due to a particular scene I was expecting something more complicated, because the twist gets explained fairly well. This scene was also the one that reminded me of ""Enemy"" and this was the one where Louise sees the alien in the corner. It reminded me of the giant spider in ""Enemy"", and because of that I was expecting a movie that you really have to think about to get. That's not entirely the case with this movie. It does make you think, but not in the way that ""Enemy"" does. This one makes you think about humankind and how we react in situations like these. We would just attack them, and that our society just doesn't accept different. It also makes you think about the concept of time and time loops. I loved the fact that the movie makes you think about these things, because that's when you know you've seen a good movie: when it makes you think about it, and not necessarily the things they show in the movie, but the questions it brings up. The dialogue is also very good, but at the end there's just one line that felt out of place. But that's really the only critique I have on that.<br/><br/>That's all I can say due to the word limit. In the end this was one of Villeneuve's best movies. 10/10"

"Argemaluco","10","3","10","15 December 2016"," Arrival
","It's usually a pleasure to find a ""serious"" science fiction film, because we know that it will try to make us think, and it might even teach us something about ourselves. You know... like real science fiction used to do before being usurped by the special effects. Arrival is one of those ""serious"" movies, and even though it offers various beautiful images and an impressive production design, the important thing isn't the spectacle, but the ideas it explores, the nature of the characters and the contrasting emotions provoked by the interplanetary ""culture crash"". In other words, Arrival is a vision of the ""first contact"" which places more emphasis on the human attitudes than the hypothetical extraterrestrial ""conflict"", obtaining a richness of shape and content I had rarely seen in this genre. Screenwriter Eric Heisserer took various common clichés of science fiction in order to rethink them in a format more consistent with the tone of the film; for example, the typical notion of the spaceships arriving at Earth is initially presented without showing those ships, because, during a while, we only see the reactions from the people, the media and, of course, the governments of the world. The whole cast of Arrival brings excellent performances; my favorite was the one from Forest Whitaker, who perfectly captures the internal strength of a sensible and pragmatic military who inflexibly sticks to the rules of the high command. Heisserer perfectly handles the fascinating central idea of the screenplay, until getting to an amazing twist, solidly unifying all the disparate elements of the tale... particularly a family tragedy in the main character's past, as well as the unavoidable romantic hints between the physicist and her. In this case, the romantic sub- plot is an integral part of the narrative, multiplying its emotional impact and accentuating the universal connection theme which leaves us with a bittersweet, but hugely satisfactory sensation, once the film ends. In summary: an extraordinary film which expresses epic science fiction in personal terms. Arthur C. Clarke would have been proud."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","10","12 December 2016"," The kind of sci-fi film you know will be relevant for a long time to come
","Science fiction might have a reputation as a niche genre, but sci-fi movies have also proved, over the course of film history, to be among the most socially important. It's not often that those important ones come along, but time could prove ""Arrival"" to be one of them.<br/><br/>French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve's latest success comes in the tradition of films such as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" — an alien invasion story that is less about our fascination with life on other planets and more about using aliens as a way to hold a mirror up to humanity.<br/><br/>Although a dozen giant black sideways dome-shaped spaceships (called ""shells"") parking themselves all over the world suggests a story of a grand scale, ""Arrival"" is actually rather intimate, focusing mostly on Amy Adams' character Louise, the country's top language expert, who's recruited by the government to try and communicate with the aliens. With a team of military personnel and the help of Ian, a physicist (Jeremy Renner), Louise attempts to decode the aliens' written language and discern their purpose on Earth.<br/><br/>Components of ""Arrival"" feel like a methodical mystery as Louise and Ian make progress and inch closer to the truth. Meanwhile, the pressure mounts as the rest of the world is panicked, and China and Russia — among other countries – consider different and potentially more volatile tactics to get answers.<br/><br/>Villeneuve is not a typical genre filmmaker, which is what makes his genre films of the last few years so unique. He's much more patient and methodical, which forces audiences to soak in the atmosphere and tone of his films. This style lends itself well to the mysterious nature of the story. It engages the viewer with a perpetual curiosity that helps to offset any potential concerns of genre fans that it might be too boring.<br/><br/>Adams also proves the perfect main subject. She makes even the most mundane exposition sound important and she brings such deep humanity into every role she plays, which turns out to be crucial to ""Arrival"" in particular, given what screenwriter Eric Heisserer (based on a story by Ted Chiang) is trying to say about the human condition.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" packs a big third act twist, but the joy of discovering it isn't as important as the philosophical ideas that accompany it. This is a film for theorists and nerdy intellectuals to really sink their teeth into (or perhaps even tear apart the scientific validity of), yet at the same time there's room for just about anyone, not just fans of the genre and these big theoretical questions, to partake in the conversation.<br/><br/>There are actually a couple thematic components to the story that while equally interesting and deserving of attention, in a way split the film's catharsis in two. Both of these big ideas can certainly draw out an emotional response on their own, and viewers might find that one resonates more than the other and lean toward that particular idea as being the central theme of the film, but each has enough prominence that one diminishes the power of the other. It's difficult to complain about a film that has too much good stuff packed into it, but this multi-faceted message causes ""Arrival"" to end on a mental/cognitive note than the emotional one we most often desire in films, even for all the emotional notes it strikes.<br/><br/>No matter how the ending hits you, however, ""Arrival"" has an undeniable social relevance, to the point that it actually became more relevant less than a week after its release than it already was. This is the kind of film that will unfortunately resonate with people who see it generations from now, but we're certainly better off having ""Arrival"" as a work of art we can relate to than to not have it at all.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Some of the best science fiction films are those that aren't actually what they appear to be about, but rather use a sci-fi premise to explore the human condition right here on Earth. ""Arrival"" is one such film. Though an encounter with aliens and humankind's reaction to it sets off the action in this film and comprises the bulk of its story, it's the human characters that we learn and care about.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is one of those human characters, and she gives an absolutely lovely performance, one that totally carries the film. She gets no histrionics or big Oscar scenes, yet days after the movie I was still thinking about her and the journey her character goes on. It's hard to discuss the plot of ""Arrival"" without giving too much away to those who haven't seen it, and this is one movie that will be most effective if you know very little about it. It's got what I suppose would be considered a plot twist, but it's not one in the traditional, gimmicky sense. It grows organically from the plot, and by the time it comes you realize that it's not actually a twist but really what the movie's been about the whole time.<br/><br/>The question ""Arrival"" asks is: ""If you had your life to do over again, good and bad, and didn't have the option of changing anything, would you?"" The ending, and Adams' character's answer to that question, had me crying like a baby in the movie theater.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"jkittrell94","10","3","10","29 November 2016"," A New Scifi Classic
","This movie is the reason why science fiction has always been my favorite genre. It takes something very human and turns it into a story, using the science in the movie to further drive that story, and to give it more gravity and feeling. The score in this film is also very beautiful and Amy Adams did an amazing job acting in this one. I've always thought she was a good actress but this one really convinced me that she is truly Oscar worthy (so did American Hustle). The music in this film should be nominated for an Oscar as well. This was easily one of the best films of 2016, up there with 10 Cloverfield Lane. I think it may be my favorite scifi film since Interstellar."

And by sound I mean the score and the sounddesign. It is the clever story that unfolds and makes you think about it after you left the movie theater.

","The movie tackles one of the infamous questions that we are still struggling to answer or at least to find a way how to answer: who are we and are we really alone?. Before the release of the movie I had some heated debate with some linguists about the possibility of humans to understand a completely different semiotic communication pattern than we. The movie goes around the idea that heptapods communicate through some pictographic writing system that use it to communicate with us. Is it only designed for us or they use that system to communicate between each other. I use French when I'm talking to French who don't understand English. One thing that I has some reserves about the movie is that the fact in a matter of weeks they have reached an understanding of this complex pictographic language while we, humans, failed to even decipher some of the ancient language of of our fellow species and there are some languages that are still a mystery till now. Consequently, it would not be a cinch to decipher such complex system. Also, the link between this pictographic language and its ability to reveal the future was not well spoken and it didn't burn well. Again this movie has made linguists look cool as it was described in some of the newspapers."

Trump to alien, ""go f*** yourself..."" Politics aside, the movie is beautifully filmed and Adams is at her best, but I'm biased. This is a thinking person's film and it completely reeled me. The flashbacks to the extreme tragedy in Adams life are incredibly touching and makes her character a heroine for the ages-reinforcing the absolutely essential need for clear communication-in both personal and professional levels-the ultimate key to success.

"onix_punk","10","3","10","27 November 2016"," How Arrival completes a circle
","Dennis Villeneuve steps away from darkness for one hell of a ride into the light.<br/><br/>In most of the work we know him for, the Canadian-born director uses the worst that surrounds us to tell the story of a world beyond repair. The human desire for revenge in Prisoners or the corrupt underbelly of law presented to us in Sicario to name only two. Yet the minute it begins, we feel Arrival is going to be told through the paradigm of love.<br/><br/>So why did he choose to attack things with a different perspective this time? Why forsake what you know so well and risk engulfing yourself in a game you don't seem to know the rules of? The answers are there. The key is to listen.<br/><br/>Arrival's main focus is communication. When Amy Adams' language expert Louise is assigned the gargantuan task of translating an alien species, collaboration seems not only necessary, but impossible to avoid. Not one, but twelve alien vessels have arrived in as many distinctive places on earth. Teams of scientists and linguists alike join forces to uncover their intentions. Ranging in both geographical and political climates, the need to put their differences aside is inferred with astute meaning.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve has a knack for making metaphor clear as day. His movies do not only tell stories we can connect to emotionally. He also possesses an effortless ability to make us understand their symbolism, like no other.<br/><br/>When her colleague, the astrophysicist Ian, played by Jeremy Renner observes that she uses mathematical formulas to uncover the mysteries of heptatod (the alien language), we notice a bridging of the ever present gap between the creative, and the analytical. Two entirely different worlds collide to give birth to a new and necessary understanding.<br/><br/>It is here that we find the answer.<br/><br/>No amount of the same is going to produce different results, to paraphrase Einstein. No body of work can shine unless it is scrutinized by itself. And what better way to do that than flip it on its head? By tuning in to another voice, Villeneuve proposes we have the cure for the cancer that is our world.<br/><br/>However, assuming the worst is what people do best, and traces of it are also present here. We are certain the aliens are out to get us, and will sometimes stop at nothing to prove so. Using language as weapon seems to be one of our ""strengths"".<br/><br/>To communicate wholly with others is to first be able to communicate to ourselves. The portrayal of this process takes place through vignettes that show Louise' life ""before"" the arrival. She first has to mend the broken pieces that she did not know were there. Only then can she save us from ourselves.<br/><br/>By pitting Arrival against his best opus up until now, Denis Villeneuve created something bigger than himself. He manages to question everything he has ever believed in before and make us find hope in the process. After I've left the theater that evening I've often asked myself: whom else who thinks different than me have I shut out, and lost a world of treasure because of that?"
"cultfilmfan","8","3","10","26 November 2016"," Arrival
","Having now seen three of Denis Villeneuve's films on the big screen (Incendies, Sicario and now Arrival), I hope I do not repeat myself, or my other reviews when I say this, but he is definitely a director who is completely aware and knows how to perfectly arouse and set the viewer's senses to an almost stunned, or at least a very kind of awe inspiring emotion that is completely generated and fuelled by the powerful emotion and power that his films so masterfully play within us with our emotions and senses of vision and hearing. There are some scenes in Arrival, one scene in particular very early in the film where the three main characters are suited up in their protective suits and are investigating a mysterious pod and looking to see what the contents are inside of it and what, or who it represents. The scene sounds ordinary, or simple enough I do admit. However with Villeneuve's slow motion camera and the powerful musical accompaniment of Johann Johannsson's powerful score, the scene is anything but. As we get closer to investigating this pod and what, or who may be inside, I could feel a feeling of tension building up inside of me and I generally felt suspense and also a riveting feeling of fascination and curiosity as to what these characters may find. In a sense I also deeply felt a fear of the unknown as I was not sure what these characters would run into, or whether it would be good or bad. The film in this scene in particular had the same masterful power that Sicario did for example at building suspense and creating a feeling of uneasiness and yet at the same time completely transforming us into the events we are witnessing on the screen and allowing us to be every bit a part of them and everything feels so real and life like and it is as if we are not just watching the film, but that we are also a part of it. Like last year's Sicario, Arrival is by no means a suspense, thriller, or horror film in any way. Also most of the film does not have that impending sense of dread, or doom whereas I felt for one that Sicario did. However this scene in Arrival, was so brilliantly done and played on every single part of my senses and emotions that I would have to say that single handedly it was the most powerful and rewarding part of the film for me. Not to say that the film is bad in any way because it is not and while I vastly prefer Incendies and Sicario, to Arrival, I still found a lot of merit and things to compliment the film on and very few faults. The film if one had to classify it would be labelled as science fiction, but this is more a science fiction film where logic and one's emotions and senses play a large part and anyone looking for huge explosions, or massive special effects and action scenes should look elsewhere. Thankfully here Mr. Villeneuve knows how to create a decent science fiction film with a story that actually makes us think and uses smart and gifted people to play and tell the story and we are never at a loss, or bored, or left restless for any lack of action, special effects, or any of the same stuff we see year after year in your typical Summer movie blockbuster. This film is way smarter and better made than all that and it uses real people and situations that come out of real life to create a story that is in some ways quite unbelievable, but in it's own way and with it's precise and persuasive storytelling, we are hooked not only for reasons of sheer interest, but also we now have our emotions invested into the film, so however the film ends we are in it for the long haul. Amy Adams, does a very good job of playing a woman who has had past tragedies in her life that prevent her from finding joy and peace in a lot of ways, but she is also while hesitant about a lot of things, also a very independent person and one who relies on logic and emotions to make her decisions and do what she thinks is right. She is a damaged person in many ways and we see her daily struggles, but we also see that deep down she has the resources and the power to overcome that if she will let it. The supporting performances from Renner, Whitaker and Stuhlbarg are also all good as they are all typically good actors and do fine here as well. I did however find that the film at times lost some of what made it so interesting in it's second half which I didn't find quite as strong as the first and I also found there to be a lot of things that didn't quite add up, or several red herrings, or things that just didn't all come together for me. I wouldn't say that I didn't understand the film, or maybe I should say that some of it I got and other parts just left me puzzled and there was still a lot left unanswered, or that didn't make sense. This proved to be a bit of a problem at times. Still for a modern day science fiction film which is not typically what I would go see, Arrival is better than most and I thank Villeneuve for giving us a thinking person's film and not just more of the same old stuff that we have seen countless times before."
"Kubricksboy","9","3","10","26 November 2016"," Story of Our Time
","Arrival, as the name would suggest, is not about the aliens, but it is the story of a linguist who corresponds with the extraterrestrials. It is adapted from Ted Chiang's novella called 'Story of your Life', which could have been an apt name for the Film, but it sure would not have aroused as much interest as the name 'Arrival' would. What is considered a 'generic plot' in all the alien invasion films is nothing more than a background in Arrival, and in the foreground, we envision the struggles of the Human Psyche. This is where Arrival stands out with the very best films that came out of the Sci-Fi genre. Like in all the other great Sci-Fi Films, the science in Arrival is only used as a means to convey the philosophical underline.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve is a trademark for psychological thrillers, and in this film, he doesn't shy away from his comfort zone, but rather embraces it and uses it to the film's advantage. Eric Heisserer's adaptation would not have been executed as well as it did in any other hands. The story structure is rather too complex and adds an air of mystery and thrill around what is rather a dramatic story. The Cinematography, music, acting and all other aspects which we consider in judging a film are all accounted for, and your final verdict would most probably be that it is a great film, that it is one the best films of the year, or the decade, or perhaps even of all time.<br/><br/>But all those aspects as are not as important with Arrival as they are with many other films. Arrival is one of this rarest films where one single aspect of the film triumphs over all others. Here, it is the story. The story of Arrival is as captivating as it is thoughtful. You will think about this film long after it is over; you will think about what you saw, about what it meant, and above all about how beautiful its meaning was. The philosophical underline will captivate you. It speaks to you about time, free will, and the inevitability of the future. And you won't be able to help but wonder about how beautiful all of it was.<br/><br/>Arrival is a Sci-Fi film which offers a lot more profundity and thoughtfulness than any other Sci-Fi films in the recent times. This is one among the giants of Sci-Fi."

"kefeilei","3","3","10","18 November 2016"," A disappointment as a serious Sci-Fi movie
","I enjoyed it very much up until the last 20 minutes. Then it turned out to be a massive disappointment. It is very much like my experience with LOST, whose season one built up a huge hype (""wow I can't wait to see how these mysteries are solved in a reasonable manner!"") and then the writers just waived their hands and went ""mehhh, it's all supernatural"".<br/><br/>Yes, ""handwavy"" is the keyword for this movie. The first half is great: it contains so many novel elements and thought-provoking details, and together with its slow pace, engages viewers in active and fascinating thinking and deciphering. But it is there only to make the second half more disappointing when you discover that its rendering of the translation process of an alien language is way too shallow; that there's little explanation for the alien's outlandish writing system; that there's no in-depth thoughts on what time is and how perceiving it as non-linear affects our world and causality (which is the main theme!).<br/><br/>For all the elements in this movie that are fascinating (How to translate an alien language? How does the alien's writing system work and *how* it changes people's thinking?), the writers could not find out a remotely satisfactory answer and decided to waive their hands and say ""they work, dunno how"". Not to mention at the end they played the time travel card, a recurring theme of which many great Sci-Fi movies offered their perspectives, but this one added none. It drew a picture too big for its own good.<br/><br/>So if you just want a movie with aliens in it, kind of thrilling, and in the end tells you a kind of moving story, Arrival can hit that bar. But It's a let-down for serious Sci-Fi fans. It has too little science in it."
"harrywhitehead","8","3","10","17 November 2016"," A heartfelt and near flawless sci-fi, that is sure to become a modern classic.
","Directed by Denis Villeneuve, and adapted from Ted Chiang's The Story of Your Life [1998], Arrival explores how mankind would react to, and communicate with, extraterrestrial beings, who without warning and with an unclear purpose, touch down in twelve locations across the earth.<br/><br/>Threatened by their arrival a team of specialists, led by linguist Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and scientist Ian Donnelley (Jeremy Renner), are tasked with communicating with the aliens, and ultimately deducing whether they have peaceful or hostile intentions.<br/><br/>Perhaps surprisingly Arrival is not just a film about an encounter with extraterrestrials, but is at its core a heartfelt and visceral look at more universal and ideological themes of love, loss, tolerance and acceptance, to name a few.<br/><br/>Acting, particularly from lead Amy Adams, is superb with scenes of genuine emotion and delicate intimacy throughout. Jóhann Jóhannsson's original score matches this sentiment well, with deep and resonating crescendos and delicate strings, which create subdued and deeply moving scenes. <br/><br/>Though the scenario of aliens landing on earth could be viewed as cliché and overdone (Close Encounters of the Third Kind [1977], Independence Day [1996], Contact [1997], etc.), it is ultimately in the final act where Arrival steps into new ground, and transforms into a movie that demands your attention and reflection long after the credits have rolled."
"mattrochman","9","3","10","16 November 2016"," Highly intellectual and brilliant film (explanation included)
","This film is magnificent. It's is a real mind journey and don't be disheartened if you had trouble putting the pieces together immediately. I have included my explanation below. <br/><br/>Like the film Contact, this film examines the realistic questions and conundrums that humans would likely face if we made contact with an alien race. How would we communicate? What would be their purpose?.etc..<br/><br/>So yes - this is not anything like Independence Day. There are no alien craft with green lasers... thank god... <br/><br/>The intellectual aspects of the film are complex and they are handled in just the right way. They don't handhold and overtly explain everything, rather engaging the viewer to think about it and ponder deeps questions well after the film has ended. <br/><br/>A surprisingly grand film, great script, great film making, brilliant acting. Should be given at least an Oscar of two. It has made it into my top 10 favorite films of all times. <br/><br/>****MY EXPLANATION***** You know the expression ""you never forget how to ride a bike?"" That's because, when you hop on a bike after no doing it for years, your brain draws on memories of how to ride and how to balance from your past.<br/><br/>Well, by learning the alien language, the Louise gradually gained more clear insights into the future. You could call them 'flashforwards' but they are really memories from the future. <br/><br/>We only know time to be linear: past, present and future. You can draw on the past in the present. But in this film, the alien language gives you memories of the future that you can draw upon to use in the present. Yes this does raise a rather curious ""time"" paradox. But that's the gist of it. That's why she can draw on a future memory meeting the Chinese General and use it in the present. That's why she can also draw on the future book she will write explaining alien language so she can communicate with the black ink stuff in the present. <br/><br/>Like the name ""Hannah"" - understanding the alien language allowed her to read time forward and backwards. Imagine if you could write a sentence with both hands at the same time, each coming from the opposite direction and meeting in the middle. This line was said in the film and parallels the way aliens look at and deal with time. That's why their communications are complex (and symbolically circular rather than linear). It would seem that the ability to flashforward is explained in the film with ""learning a new language rewires your brain and thinking.""<br/><br/>The purpose of the future daughter who will get a terminal illness is dealing with fate. If we were able to flashforward (have future memories) would we change our decisions in the present? Wisely it doesn't answer this directly, but deals with it deeply. Something for the viewer to wonder on the way home, but also raises an interesting paradox in itself: Maybe she had memories of the future because that was never going to change her mind in the present. Perhaps that was the key to unlocking the ability or part of it. <br/><br/>One unexplained aspect: why did Ian (Renner) not also have flash forwards? Perhaps Louise was the only one truly capable of processing it in her mind."
"parleon-thedon","9","3","10","14 November 2016"," Arrival - review: Complex & Moody
","Arrival is complex. Denis Villeneuve is an interesting director. Every single one of his movies comes with great atmosphere. The only problem I have with Villeneuve's movies are that they lack proper story execution. His movies are engaging enough, but I just always feel that there's something ultimately missing from his stories. I can follow and understand his movies perfectly, but there's just something about his endings that never quite grasp me, and I'm of the belief that his movies never really pack a full punch.<br/><br/>Complexity - the story isn't hard to follow; it's just that there are many layers to this seemingly complicated plot.<br/><br/>Direction - This movie is to be taken seriously; there aren't any action set-pieces, motherships, or gimmicky clichés, however, there is a gimmick present here, but that gimmick is thought-provoking originality within a sci-fi movie. The ultimate question is, does the gimmick work, and my answer is yes to a point.<br/><br/>Atmosphere - Somber, moody, dreadful, and bleak is how I would describe this movie. The cinematography in here is astonishing, and the visuals are breathtaking. The musical score sets the mood for each scene (especially the wide shots of the landscapes with the ships... those are my favorite scenes).<br/><br/>Overall, Arrival is a good movie, but something happens by the end that makes me question its intentions; I didn't understand what the purpose was, but I accepted its merit. Is this movie questioning us as humans in humanity, or is there a philosophical message to be had here? Even though I didn't like the ending all that much, I have to admit that it does make me think.<br/><br/>A-"
"RforFilm","9","3","10","14 November 2016"," Arrival identifies it's own complex language to deliver a great film message
","Put yourself back in French class in high school. The textbook your given has a preface that the new language your about to acquire isn't just important in a modern world, but remains a poetic way of communicating. But then your teacher comes in and you can't get past her introductory, ""Bonjour!"". It all seems to come out as alien and you suddenly think that you'll never be able to communicate with the French. First of all, many French people know English. The other thing that people tend to forget that as babies, their own language was just as strange.<br/><br/>Though we speak and write every day, it usually never comes across that were using a complex system of characters and set structures to even do something basic. It's only when were learning a new language when the difficulty comes up of seeing something in Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, and even sign language. Today's movie actually addresses something that very few science fiction ever figure out; if aliens did come to earth or vice-versa, just how do we talk to them? Much of the previous movies either conveniently give them the English language or simply make the uncommunicative hostile. Arrival goes into better detail on how one might be able to crack an alien language. <br/><br/>Linguist professor Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams) is a brilliant woman, but seems to suffer from bad memories of her daughter who died young of a rare disease. When she goes in to teach a class, she witnesses the news which talks about twelve mysterious UFOs that have touched over various parts of the world. The ships remain in place, but this sets off a panic from the public. Louise is selected for a military team to go to the UFO that's hovering over Montana.<br/><br/>A part of the team is also physicist Donnelly (played by Jeremy Renner) and US Army Colonel Weber (played by Forest Whitaker). They all eventually enter the ship and make first contact with the aliens, which are dubbed ""Abbott and Costello"" to tell the two a part. Louise uses her skills to teach them a few basic words like ""Human"" and ""Earth"". The written response from the aliens is incredibly complicated circle-like symbols. By working with the aliens more, she starts to understand just how the circles work and what each structure means. She is working to eventually ask, ""Why did you come to Earth?"".<br/><br/>Arrival happens to be a fresh change of pace in the science fiction genre, especially after an abysmal summer of lame blockbusters. Not only is the story very creative with how people could potentially talk to life in the universe, but it is gorgeously shot. Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) has crafted the best cinematography of the year with the way he can capture depression, mystery, and from the shot of the first flight into Montana, awe. He also manages to cleverly keep the story within the military camp and only show the outside world through news channels, making the situation more confined.<br/><br/>Amy Adams proves again that she's a very strong actor, considering my phrase for her in 2014 for Big Eyes (which I still feel she was robbed of an Oscar nomination). Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whitaker, while they do fine, are merely passable and are surprisingly given little development. Though to the credit of the story, it at least keeps it's focus on what it needs to do.<br/><br/>Speaking of story, I'll admit that the final twist is creative to both the plot and they way the film is structured, so I will not dare spoil that here. <br/><br/>I'll give this nine shell UFOs out of ten. Those that are looking for a heavier action movie are not going to get this here. What they will get is a slower (intentionally) story about how hard it would be to even say hello should aliens come to our planet."

"ztigr","7","3","10","12 November 2016"," Not so much a sci fi film as a philosophical film (mild spoilers)
","Alright the thought provoking (if it is) question of this film is: If you knew your future would you do the same things. Of course this is really a pretty easy question...if you live a life of woe than know you'd change it, but if you had a mix of good and bad you'd probably take the bad because of the good. That's the ""gift"" the aliens supposedly give, the ability through a universal language to rewire your mind in a way that time no longer is linear. so experiences in the past can still be experienced as clear as the present, and you know the future. And if you think about it, humans would evolve quickly because they'd be able to avoid the very wrong paths very easily, thus taking away the need to learn by trial and error.<br/><br/>Overall the film makes you think, and that's why I give it a pretty good score. It really moves slow, but keeps you engaged, so I always give films like that some leeway.<br/><br/>Now some problems. First the aliens present this ""gift"" by translating that word to ""weapon""...well that doesn't make a lot of sense because the scientists teaching them language, would probably be pretty specific as to what the terms ""weapon"", ""gift"" and ""tool"" are (terms the aliens see as synonyms. AND if language is SUCH an important thing to these aliens, you would specifically make sure you were getting your words right. And if this gift language is supposedly so universal and so wonderful than how is it that they accidentally use the word ""weapon"" in place of ""gift"" when they are talking about it to the humans? <br/><br/>The second problem is the tiny subplot with the soldiers who are afraid and take action against the aliens. Anyone could see this coming a mile away, which goes to say in the real world the military would see this as a probability and protect against it. So its a little silly, to suggest it could happen. I would also doubt the military would allow these soldiers as much contact with the outside world as they were having too. They make phone calls, watch television news...and this is supposedly a ""top secret persons"" only site. <br/><br/>Of course those plot points are to bring a little action to the mix, rather than move along the premise."

The film is itself a brilliant lesson in visual language, expressed through both the plot and the cinematography. <br/><br/>With it's attention to the logical uncertainties of alien interaction and the cast performing their roles excellently, I gladly found Arrival to be an (I must say, pretty much perfectly executed) intelligent, deeply emotionally involved exemplification of the nature of communication, information, elementary and complex human actions... suggesting so much more than what is revealed.<br/><br/>Come for the intelligent scifi, stay for the very real visual explanations and demonstrations of communication and their respective emotional constituents. This movie is smart enough to be a meditation on it's own power. <br/><br/>But don't take my word for it. da dun DUN!"

","Amy Adams is exceptional and really showcases her talents in this thought provoking Sci-fi movie. The 'aliens have landed' type of movie has been done too often, usually predictable, leave your brain at the door kind of nonsense. Arrival needs, and demands your attention throughout, with a very well directed and written film. With an interesting take on how the world would unite or split while facing an alien presence the director makes the story somewhat relevant with today's society. I enjoyed Arrival and would recommend taking time to go see it even although the story does seem to drift away in the final third."

","Every once in a while you come across a film which totally surprises you, Arrival is one of those and what makes it so special is that it's a Hollywood blockbuster. Seldom you see a film which such artistry at the popcorn cinemas. Some might call it sentimental or vague but it's definitely a masterpiece, awesome cinematography, focus on character instead of action, great sound design, soundtrack and most importantly, it tells a lesson about humanity and it uses aliens in a totally exceptional way although the trailer might suggest otherwise. Truly tought provoking and intriguing stuff and that's exactly why it's important independent directors like Denis Villeneuve make blockbusters to because they now how to spend the money wisely and create unforgettable experiences for the average popcorn audience who is being bombarded with conventional, unoriginal and franchised films. Go and see this movie without a doubt!"
"TheMovieDiorama","10","4","16","10 November 2016"," The greatest piece of cinema in recent memory has arrived.
","Another ""aliens making contact with Earth"" movie, Arrival is about a linguistics translator being called to try and translate an alien language from twelve unidentified objects to determine what their purpose on Earth is. Before I continue the review, I must warn you that I've specifically stayed up late at night in order to write this. Arrival is quite simply the greatest piece of cinema I have seen in recent memory. I'm tempted to say, it is on par with Gravity as my favourite sci-fi movie of all time. Damn, that was exciting to say. Now before you say I'm over-exaggerating, let me give you the reasons for this grand statement. Firstly the acting was powerful from every actor. Amy Adams deserves a nomination for this, she pulls in the emotional heft of her character whilst maintaining an intelligent persona. Jeremy Renner was also good as the witty scientist who accompanies Adams and Forest Whitaker was superb as a military colonel who has the weight of America on his shoulders. Then we go to the direction, Denis Villeneuve has yet to make a bad movie. Prisoners was flawless as a thriller. Sicario was excellent and now Arrival has just topped both of these. If he does not get a nomination for Best Director, something is clearly wrong. The way he slowly pans the camera to create tension, the way he focuses in and out of objects in the same shot, heck even the landscape shots are beautiful. Cinematography was captivating, the fact that the alien objects (that the characters refer to as 'shells') look so photorealistic that you can't determine if they are computer generated or not...is just insane. The musical score was beautiful, switching between a string arrangement for the more emotional scenes and a more sci-fi sounding tune for when the characters enter the 'shell'. It definitely pulled me in as a viewer. This brings me to best part of the film, the story. For a film involving a linguist and decoding a language, one would imagine it would be boring. Quite the opposite, I was so intrigued by the methodologies behind the linguistics and how they were used to decipher the language that it just enthralled me. There are some turns that the film takes that some might not agree with, but in my opinion they worked well. It's good to see a sci-fi film that does not insult the audience's intelligence and it's also good it does not require action to be interesting and thrilling. I could go on for hours...I really could. I've never been so happy for a film to be so good in all my life, and I can't wait to watch it again. Overall, Arrival is intriguing, beautifully composed, confidently directed and is quite simply the greatest piece of cinema in recent memory. I seriously hope everyone watches this.<br/><br/><ul><li>Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</li></ul>"

"gavin6942","7","3","11","21 February 2017"," Great Film, But Too Much Drama For My Taste
","When twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is great: the look, the science, the acting, the sound. I especially loved how much linguistics played a role in the story, and how it was explained the various parts of language in thought, as well as the advantages of a written versus spoken communication.<br/><br/>I also thought the idea of the non-linear use of time was very clever, and fairly well-executed. I actually figured out the twist about halfway through, but that didn't make it any less interesting or intriguing. Certain aspects call to mind causality, and put them into question: could the Chinese general say and do things in the future that would assist in the past? Under a strict timeline, no. But yet, for the film, it works.<br/><br/>Which then raises the question: if the timeline is not linear, not causal, how can Louise access the future at all? Would their not be an infinite number of possible futures? By knowing of her daughter's illness, does not that very awareness open the door for her to choose not to have children and avoid all her visions becoming reality? Or is she doomed to ""choose"" a path that is the only one fate allows her to take? <br/><br/>So why do I only give the film a 7 rather than the higher number most people feel it deserves? Simply put, I found the drama a bit heavy-handed. As a science fiction film, it is great, but really diminished by the emotional aspects attached. And while those may be important to certain points the film is trying to make, it still seems like too much focus is put on them. This really brought me out of my enjoyment."
"sammi_lennon","9","3","11","7 February 2017"," For the first time in a very long time I am wholly satisfied
","For me, this film is so groundbreaking and profoundly moving that it doesn't require a lengthy review. Indeed, for me, no review could really do it justice. Suffice it to say that when a film is as brilliantly crafted as Arrival, it articulates itself so acutely that it renders potential reviewers capable of little more than diluting its purity and thus, ultimately doing it a disservice. In my humble opinion Arrival hits the spot on a multiplicity of levels. Examining as it does an experience of alien/human interaction in a fashion that is; innovative, plausible, thought provoking, inspiring and completely moving. Nothing is perfect, and Arrival certainly avails itself of the proverbial 'poetic license' but believe me, as a viewer you won't care one iota about that. We are, after all, talking science fiction here.... how true to life, accurately scientific and technically robust can a film grounded in beguiling fantasy really be? Take it for what it is, Sci Fi at its very, very best and you most certainly won't be disappointed. A sci fi masterpiece to top all others this century so far....."
"chip-726-410993","9","3","11","3 February 2017"," Thoughtful and Beautiful
","Science fiction films tend to stratify into 3 categories, in my mind. The most commercially successful are really just adventure films set in a science fiction universe. These focus on action and fantasy, with futuristic or high-concept elements. They leverage classic story archetypes and superlative visuals to produce enjoyable escapism. Star Wars is the exemplar of this sub-genre, and although Star Trek aspires to greater scientific rigor, it belongs here too.<br/><br/>The second set similarly uses science as a backdrop for noir. These are the darker films, the dystopian adventures. They may not be as hopeful or as fun, but they tend to be more pointed. These films typically propound on a ""what if"" premise, plumbing the dingy depths of possibility. The best are often imaginative, twisted interrogations of human nature or society. This is Blade Runner, The Matrix, Dark City.<br/><br/>Finally, there are what I like to call ""thinking"" films. They are headier, and explore ideas that fundamentally change reality or alter our perception of it. They eschew spectacle and adrenaline to allow the audience to dive deep on a single premise. These films are typically smaller in focus, slower, often centering around the journey of a single character. Usually less accessible movies, Hamlet might opine that these ""pleased not the million, (but) 'twas caviar to the general"". I would count 2001, Interstellar, K-PAX and others as ""thinking"" sci-fi. Arrival fits securely in this group.<br/><br/>Arrival is a big budget take on a small story, focusing almost myopically on Louise, a linguistics expert who is conscripted to help communicate with extra-terrestrial beings who arrive suddenly above the Earth. Her journey of consciousness as she learns to comprehend the aliens serves as the plot, using the events of the story more as context than narrative. Director Denis Villeneuve deftly uses arresting visuals and frank, realistic sensibilities to relate a story that might otherwise be esoteric. It's fantastic elements are believable because of his steady hand, and even the few quibbles i had in hindsight melted away while watching the screen.<br/><br/>Arrival is an experience. It is thoughtful and beautiful, and has lingered in my thoughts since viewing."

"ReasonableApe","10","3","11","31 December 2016"," There is grandeur in this view of life
","Arrival is one of those epic movies that makes you dazed and teary-eyed, in a good way. Even after watching the movie, just thinking about its elegant premise gives one shivers down the spine. <br/><br/>I read the short story that it's based on as part of Ted Chiang's 'Stories of your life and others' in 2014. And I remember thinking to myself, this is one of the greatest, most creative stories ever written. I'm so glad the movie version didn't disappoint like so many other screen adaptations that fall short of doing the book justice.<br/><br/>Arrival combines two of my favorite themes, first contact and linguistics. I have a couple of other favorite movies that come to mind that have similar thematic structures: Independence Day (1996), Contact (1997), The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) and Interstellar (2014). Many recent sci-fi stories suffer from overused tropes and predictable clichés, not Arrival. It's got one of the most creative and daring sci-fi plots in recent years. I would absolutely love to see more film adaptation of Ted Chiang's books. The best candidate in my opinion would be one of his lesser known short-stories, 'The Evolution of Human Science'."

","I was incredibly excited to go into this movie since it was being directed by one of the best directors working today Denis Villeneuve. I walked out of this movie floored. This film I have seen twice not and there has been no other movie this year that has stuck with me long after leaving the theater. There wasn't one thing in this film I had a problem with. The performances are all incredible especially from Amy Adams who gives the best performance I have ever seen from her which is incredibly high praise since she is one of the best actresses working today. She is very subdued and you believe everything that she is doing because she sells her character so incredibly well. The cinematography is exceptional in this film and every shot has a unique visual style from Bradford Young. I am not going to spoil the ending but it takes a while to fully process and that is why it is an excellent film to go see twice because it works just as well if not better seeing it again.It's a film that gave me chills in the first 5 minutes of seeing it and pretty much the whole time. It stuck with me long after seeing the film and it's a movie that raises questions. It is a hopeful movie with bigger ideas than just a typical alien invasion movie. This has been one of the best movies so far this decade. Please do yourself a favor and go see this movie. (A+)"

"ironhorse_iv","8","3","11","20 November 2016"," I finally arrive to my conclusion. This movie is thought-provoking, however parts of it was indeed lifeless and slow. It was a good movie, but not great.
","If we ever meet an advance race of aliens, we're going to have to explain why we've made thousands of movies of us fighting and killing them. Hopefully, they could see films like this, instead. It presents battle and war as last resorts, with only frightened, desperate people looking to violence as a solution. Directed by Denis Villenuve and written by Eric Heisserer, based on the short story ""Story of Your Life"" by author Ted Chiang. The film tells the story of a linguistics expert, Louise Banks (Amy Adams) struggles to make first contact with extraterrestrial who arrive on earth, while as well, dealing with the death of her child. Without spoiling the movie, too much, like 1997's 'Contact' & 1977's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', this film is a deeply thoughtful sci-fi thriller about trying to communicate & understand with aliens rather than trying to fight them. Because of that, it teaches the message of being compassion and discovery, very well. There's also a message about time and choices that's better shown in the movie rather than ever explained here. Nevertheless, I will try to give you some scoop of some exposition. The film deals with Sapir–Whorf hypothesis or Whorfianism, a concept that linguistics and cognitive science believe in that states people perceive things differently depending on the language, we chose to learn and the culture in which, it is spoken. Sadly, the movie doesn't provide, many scenes of that, besides the 'use weapon' part. Also the film linguistics lecture exposition is not that compelling compare to the other previous films dealing with this, because it doesn't allow the learning scenes to be somewhat fun to watch. Every character's mood was dreary and morose. Every line delivered was monotone and monotonous. Don't get me wrong, I get that if aliens arrived, everybody on Earth would be scare of the unknown, but after a month or two of the aliens, not attacking you; you would think these people would lighten up. After all, the creatures are allowing you to speak to them, and you're learning more about them. One of the few things that I did not like about this film was the forced catalyst of xenophobia that was only there to move the plot along. I really hate how the film portray the Chinese as the unstable country, willing to go to war, because of a misunderstanding, with the aliens; when in reality, it's most likely us, Americans, because English is far more complex language to commutate with the aliens than Chinese. The reason, why I say this, is because China uses more ideographic and/or early mnemonic symbols to convey information yet were probably devoid of direct linguistic content. In theory, China should be more advance with their language, than us. Plus, if anything, alien arrival, would probably make human beings would probably be more unite than divide. While, Amy Adams plays a very strong, smart and intelligent female lead character. I found her to be, somewhat boring and too emotionless at times. Even the supporting characters like theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) & Colonel Weber (Forest Whittaker) were somewhat dull. All Ian really does, is exist to be a love-interest. His theoretical physics barely helps the plot, along, when it should. I would had tune out from the film, if it wasn't for, the curiosity of alien language. However, the film's alien language just doesn't add up, no matter how you put it. Being able to tell and work with time is a very valuable skill, but order to tell time, there are several key points to remember. Math is the universal language. The idea that the 'heptapods' don't know basic math, is hard to believe. It's not that possible to have advance society without such systems. In the short story, it's physics, instead of mathematics that the 'heptapods' don't get. It makes more sense, there, because they live in a world of Fermat's principle. Yet, in the film version, the language acts more like spiritualism than science. Despite that, I do have to say, I like the look of the creature. After all, the 'heptapods' species remind me of something out of 2003's animal documentary 'the Future is Wild', which states out that squids are the next sapient life on the planet Earth after human beings leave. I'm hoping that it is, where the filmmakers got the idea. I also like the look of their spaceships. Remind me of the Monolith from Arthur C. Clarke's 'Space Odyssey' series of novels and films. Even the way, the craft is curve, appears to look like a giant hematite birthstone. Terrestrial hematite is typically a mineral formed in aqueous environments or by aqueous alteration, hints my squid theory. I like that is, drawing from the 1970s trippy smart sci-fi tradition, both in cinematography and music. However, I don't like that the film is drawing the plot out. Because of that, it made the movie feel very slow paced. It takes forever, to get anywhere. I think the reason, why this movie is so successful is because of the emotional parental guilt twist. It's actually really impressive, even if it's somewhat confusing with all the time paradoxes. Overall: It is a cerebral movie that will challenge your thinking. I would say it's a good movie, but maybe falls a little short from great."

I can appreciate intellectual movies but I found the subject matter boring and the philosophy that life and time was a circle with an allegory to the scientist's own life felt flat. I cannot understand how this film is so highly rated much less entertaining. For me this was unwatchable.

She is assisted by a renowned scientist played by Jeremy Renner.<br/><br/>""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" will likely always be the benchmark for this genre (UFOs, alien landings). ""Arrival"" is a competent film with fine moments but it doesn't feel engaging enough to fill its almost two hours. Indeed, the acting is good and the story is interesting though maybe a bit far-fetched. It also seems to borrow from ""Gravity"" in which the heroine has a similar difficult past.<br/><br/>The photography of this film is usually in dark tones. The interior scenes always have different levels of darkness. The outdoors scenes are mostly night-time, nightfall, just before dawn, or overcast days. The choice of maintaining darkness is interesting but after a while, it tends to keep the viewer at a distance.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>Well, it's sort of a spoiler. After the release of ""The Martian"" last year, someone astutely pointed out that that film and ""Gravity"" were big-budget Hollywood sci-fi films that involved international co-operation, especially from China, in the rescue attempts.

","Arrival, a science fiction movie, depicting a situation where alien beings visit multiple locations on earth for a reason previously unknown. This movie looks into different reactions that could occur to an unexpected greeting by other species from outside Earth. The protagonist of the story experiences a dream consisting of ""memories"" of events that she does not yet know at the beginning of the movie, foreshadowing the events that are yet to come. When these strange creatures, octopods, appear on Earth and present to the humans a language that normal people can't comprehend, the group of scientists, and even military personal, call this main character to help to comprehend their language and learn what they want. These creatures think differently than people on Earth. Their way of thinking is almost backwards from humans. They know the outcome, but don't know the inbetweens that the outcome takes, whereas we know the inbetweens, but don't know the outcome.<br/><br/>This movie shows many incidents of miscommunication, fear of a new species, and the destruction of one side due to a lack of communication. We see many abstract perspectives in this movie and explore the difficulties we as humans have when meeting a new species, not knowing their intentions or background. We very often judge before looking into things, which causes much more damage than there needs to be. Unlike the rest of the task force involving the octopods, the protagonist does everything she could to learn about this new species and to understand their language. In doing so, she developes the ability to think as the octapods do. She was able to see the outcomes of the actions she will make in the future and was able to maniulate this way of thinking in order to save the octapods and let the, safely leave Earth.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie because it brought many concepts and current problems affecting relationships, like differing perspectives, understanding one another, communication, and even tackled the popular imaginary situation of learning about the future in order to choose a better life for yourself. This imaginary concept is shown when the protagonist learns of the sad future that is held in store for her, she decides to accept it instead of changing it to a perfect situation. This movie really sparked many thought provoking questions, especially about communication and understanding between to parties. The way in which they portrayed these issues was very clever, since many people look to the skies for communicating organisms out in the universe, ""waiting for us"".<br/><br/>Many people who wrote bad reviews about this movie haven't taken the movie into a deeper level, only scraping the surface and accusing the toppings. This movie deserves much more appreciation than these people are giving it.<br/><br/>One of the reviews says, ""my grand daughter could have drawn more convincing and frightening aliens than the highly paid special effects bods did."" I think this person mistook Arrival for a horror movie because this movie obviously is one of the more realistic sci-fi movies out there. Obviously this person doesn't know anything because space is definitely not only made of scary creatures lingering in empty space. This movie was a portrayal of a more gentle species than humans and wanting to help us in order to help them. What part of help is supposed to be horror? It is really triggering how this person expects every sci-fi movie to be exactly like the one before.<br/><br/>At least the writer of the next review understood the part that these obviously gentle creatures weren't here to be scary and frightening, but ""came to earth because they will need our help in the future so they give us the ability to 'think' like them to see time as a whole"" The one thing this reviewer didn't get was that the time travel aspect of the movie was not where the movie fell apart, it was where the whole concept was glued together. In this part of the movie, she has learned to 'think' like the octapods, seeing the result before the process of her life. And this person didn't understand the reason why the octapods came to us for help. It was because unlike humans who can understand the process for an unknown outcome (our life), these octapods know the end result, but don't know how to get there, so they take things one step at a time as it comes to them."
"easy_eight","1","2","6","26 November 2017"," Not sure why many gave this a high rating. Not worth watching.
","The movie started off well enough, but I was confused by the ending and thought that the focus on the two main characters not very compelling. The guy who played the physicist did not act like a physicist. There was not much character development and the use of flashbacks was disturbing. And she was not that impressive as a linguist.<br/><br/>I am even more confused about why so many people gave this a good review.The discovery of the aliens language was not convincing at all. It seemed ridiculous. I still do not fully understand it. The movie Contact, on the other hand, showed the viewer how the language was decoded. It was exciting and the solution unfolded. And, in the end, I sat thinking, this is it? you have got to be kidding. <br/><br/>Also, the decision to use the linguist because she had clearance that was still in effect was ridiculous. It was as if the government had decided that one linguist would be enough. And the movie did not show interaction with the many academics that would have naturally been involved. She just did not measure up and was not convincing in her role.<br/><br/>And there were no other real characters in the movie, just the military guy who originally contacted her and the physicist. That was it. Oh,and the daughter, but even that was just a series of flashbacks and not very compelling. The other actors were really just extras on the set to fill up the screen - more of a distraction than anything else.<br/><br/>And I found the facilities with the plastic doors annoying and dismal. Made me feel as if the movie-makers used this vehicle to cut costs.<br/><br/>Also, the linguist's easy access to the alien spaceship seemed to be a bit of a stretch. She could just wander out to the spacecraft on her own. Sure, that makes logical sense. In real life, she would not have been able to get access to the spaceship without going through many security checks.<br/><br/>And the fact that she could just take off her suit and be fine was laughable. You mean the testing of the atmosphere within the spaceship did not matter? Why suddenly did it matter? And if the aliens came from 3000 years in the future, why wouldn't they set up an environment that was not lethal to humans. And it was never explained why a race of aliens so different would care about humans 3000 years in the past. <br/><br/>It all seems even more ridiculous as I try to piece together the movie in all its parts. And I am still confused about the gift the aliens were giving to the humans. The movie did not take the time to explain what exactly the gift was and how it was to be administered.<br/><br/>Also, the cell phone call was a stretch. I mean, to predicate the movie on a cell phone call. And it was interesting that she just happen to find a cell phone just lying around that had the type of clearance necessary to call a top-ranking Chinese general? And the guy whose phone she took would be constantly on it talking to all kinds of people. If he lost it, he would be in deep trouble. Why would he just leave it on a table? And what is the likelihood that she would be able to even find someone's cell phone lying on a table.<br/><br/>I doubt, if in the short period of time she had to find a cell phone to make the call, she could have every found one. The only way she could have made the call is if she had the help of someone at the highest levels. Sure, just pick up a phone and call the chief of staff of the Chinese army. Gee, I could do that if I only had his number. <br/><br/>And another thing, if these aliens were so powerful that they could influence her thinking and help he see the past and future, why would they even need her? And if they are so advanced, why wouldn't they just have been able to send a message or simply figure out a way to communicate with humans. Or simply prevent the disease or whatever was going to happen without even involving the humans (the prime directive?). I mean, if they knew about the calamity to happen to earth, they would have studied human language. If you can travel through time, communicating with an intelligent species with fully developed languages would be simple.<br/><br/>And if you know how the race of humans communicated, why could not just duplicate that communication? The whole premise of the movie is that the humans could not communicate with the aliens. If you can travel through time, I cannot see how you could not communicated with another intelligent life-form. So much time was spent on the issue of communication. Without the resolution of the communications issue, there would not be much left of the movie. I am betting the books was much more interesting and the film-makes did not do justice to the book. It would be interesting to interview the author and read the book.<br/><br/>And the acting was not particularly good. Amy Adams and the physicist had one mode of interaction and one mode of acting. They both just seemed numb. No laughter, no change of tone, no humor. Also, I thought that Amy Adams lost her daughter. That was also confusing. Did she later lose her daughter? Why did the daughter talk about her father leavings? Did he leave? It was never explained other than by Amy Adams saying that the father did not like what she was saying about what was going to happen in the future.<br/><br/>Do not waste your time."

Sure, you might find it boring if you are expecting an Independence day type of action flick, but that's not what it's about.<br/><br/>In many reviews I see people talking about Louise being tormented by ""memories"" of her daughter. Do they realize that these events are not ""memories"" as Such?<br/><br/>Imagine you were given a chance to foresee the good and the bad in your future. Feeling the torment and heartbreak of what it means to lose the purest of love.

The emotion, the plot, the intellectual dialogue, the plot twist, the aesthetics, the acting, the moral, everything about this movie was just perfect in my opinion.The pathos are strong in this movie, ten minutes into the movie, my eyes were already tearing up. I also loved the original plot line, it's not you're typical ""aliens invade the planet and we all try to exterminate them while they try to exterminate us"" bull crap.

"dickievale","9","2","6","19 March 2017"," Beautiful story
","Arrival is a masterpiece of cinematography and storytelling with excellent performances delivered by all of the main cast. Having read the content of a number of negative reviews here on IMDb, I at least have a better understanding of why the insanities of, for example, Brexit and the election of Donald Trump happened. We truly are a species divided by what goes on between our ears.<br/><br/>The movie is highly recommended."
"fung0","7","2","6","5 March 2017"," Good Film, but Wastes the Original Material
","After 1400-odd reviews, I'm sure this has been said before, but I have to add my voice to the chorus. Arrival is a nice little SF thriller, well-filmed, nicely acted and brimming with atmosphere. But as an adaptation of the original short story upon which it was based, Ted Chiang's ""The Story of Your Life,"" it's an utter travesty.<br/><br/>(I won't reveal much about either the film or the story, but there are some generalities that are worth stating.)<br/><br/>Villeneuve is a director whose work I've enjoyed and admired. And I can appreciate that there must have been enormous pressure to create a marketable film. Profit figures indicate that Villeneuve succeeded, by crafting a moody, modernized take on ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" It's all a bit over-familiar, but well executed, and enlivened by beautiful digital imagery.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, financial success was achieved by throwing away absolutely everything that's truly worthwhile about the original story. I won't give away much, other than to point out that the change in titles tells it all. The short story is subjective, and it's not about the effect that alien Arrival has on Earth's politics or culture. It's about the aliens' effect, and particularly the effect of their language, on one person. And it's told very much from the point of view of that one person.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Arrival, but I was also massively disappointed that Villeneuve failed to deliver the movingly existential gem I was expecting, and which as a director he was amply capable of creating. If you haven't seen the film, I strongly recommend you read the story first. It's by far the greater of the two works, and deserves to be experienced without preconceptions."
"Calaverasgrande","7","2","6","27 February 2017"," good not great
","I was pretty turned off on this movie right out of the gate. It starts like a student film. With a really amateurish juxtaposition of someone 'saying' their emotions. If you have ever been to a student film fest you know what I mean. It was only missing a segment of sloppily putting makeup on to really nail that vibe. Then it gets better, mostly because Forest Whitaker shows up. Amy Adams does her usual great job. As does Jeremy Renner. And the story itself is very good. However the execution was just so gosh dang twee and precious. If you take away the foreboding alien ship and its occupants you have a pile of breathy flashbacks and washed out visuals. Don't get me wrong, I am not expecting every sci-fi film to be Rogue One. However the great core ideas of this story are underutilized. While this could have been a fascinating movie, it is instead boring. I could take the slow pace and precious presentation, if there was something in the way of character development. But beyond Amy Adams character everyone else are just cardboard cutouts that provide utilitarian roles. Even Renner and Whitaker. Maybe in 10-15 years someone will remake this into a decent film?<br/><br/>I wonder if the director likes science fiction at all, or is just under contract."
"c-gribble90","9","2","6","26 February 2017"," A bleak look at our own failings as a species contained within the wonder of meeting a new one...
","(SOME MAY FEEL CONTAINS SPOILERS)<br/><br/>I feel compelled to write a review after observing all the 1* reviews this film is receiving. Trust me I understand that everyone has an opinion but to just nonchalantly give some a low mark just cause it wasn't your cup of tea is childish, and would mean many(who may enjoy this) would miss it.<br/><br/>I thought the film humanised a very 'alien' concept, so much to say as it was focused on one woman's goal to peacefully interact with something not of this world, to learn and understand, to interact and grow. Something many lack within our own species.<br/><br/>Many have pointed to the small group of Military personnel who try and attack the vessel as silly,and with no basis, but our race over history doesn't need much of a motive to fire the first shot. Only a fear and insecurity, which can indeed build over a small group over a few months.<br/><br/>That's what I think the problem people have, the film doesn't hold your hand and walk you through, it's theme is of meeting another species who doesn't see time like us, and this is how I felt as a viewer, that time wasn't linear, that questions of 'how did Louise crack this language/sound in such a short time?' just don't matter, you're looking for logic in something completely illogical. <br/><br/>For me it left me pondering my own existence, if with the knowledge the main character held, would I make the same life choices, is the journey, the experience more than the destination. It had me thinking of personal interactions with people from a different country, religious view, sexually, it turned the camera away from the 'aliens' and solely put in our own downfalls as a species. For that reason I believe it's a must watch.<br/><br/>In summary, if you're looking for a Sci-fi film with a slower pace, emphasis on small pieces of dialogue, drawn out shots, touching musical score and subtle but powerful performance from Amy Adams then take two hours to watch Arrival and many more to digest it's content."
"Reno-Rangan","7","2","6","24 February 2017"," It was a perfect contact, but troubled at the communication.
","The film was decent. Nowadays there are lots of altered versions coming that you won't easily say those are the remakes or reboots or spin- offs or whatever they call them in these days. Like 'Premotheus' to 'Alien', this film can remind you a few titles from the past, but 'Contact' is what the majority of us believes it got inspired.<br/><br/>The eight Oscars nominees for the film is insane. I know some people liked it, and the film was good, that does not mean it is an Oscar product. I'm okay with the technical side recognition as it deserved that. So visually it was very good, but not a special effects extravaganza. Just a simple sci-fi drama, with a few thrills, particularly towards the end.<br/><br/>When the unexpected visitors from the outer-space land their ships in the twelve different locations on the earth, the humans patiently try to communicate with them to learn their intentions. This story focused on the American soil, where experts are brought in to decode the alien language. How the rest of tale develops was told in the remaining parts.<br/><br/>To me it smells like a trilogy. If not, it should be. I enjoyed it, mainly because of being a drama. Sci-fi is always associated with action, adventure and thriller, but this drama was something fresh as per todays computer graphics dominated cinema world. This is particularly for the family and older people like the grownups. Like I said the youngsters love action and violence. So it is a one time viewable film and you will get everything in that attempt itself.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Dustyart","7","2","6","23 February 2017"," Interesting or Boring, Depending on a Viewer's Taste
","Having read many good and bad reviews of this film, I am not going to go into too many descriptive details as to why I liked this movie, or give away anything too specific as to its plot or conclusion. Instead, I'm going to simply warn those away who might find this film a big yawn. If you are someone who wants cowboys and Indians in space, light sabers, funny looking aliens who happen to speak English, clearly defined good or evil adversaries shooting at one another and blowing things up, then this film will offer you nothing. Clearly, many viewers either felt this movie was a drag or saw themselves as being intellectually superior to its creators. There were complaints of plot holes, clichés, slow pacing and my favorite, pretentiousness, an overused word that often just means the subject was too deep to trouble one's brain over. Some people just want to be entertained, and that's fine, and others don't want to be lectured to, and I get that, too. <br/><br/>There is an attempt in this movie to offer some kind of hope that the divided nations of this world might work together someday for a common cause. Some reviewers seem to hate this kind of wishful thinking, finding such ideas trite, and I even read some political rants blasting the film for its liberal appeal and/or its sentimental, romantic sub-plot. These are all valid criticisms, but I don't happen to share them. <br/><br/>For my money, this good-looking, atmospheric bit of science fiction story-telling beats most of the big special effects blockbusters of the past thirty years by miles. It reminded me of previous attempts at using science fiction to ponder big ideas, like the definitive film in this genre, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), and later, THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH (1976), CONTACT and GATTACA, (both 1997), DISTRICT 9 (2009), CLOUD ATLAS (2012) and INTERSTELLAR (2014), all varied attempts to get at something deeper than flying saucers and silly monsters. Some of these movies had bigger special effects, faster pacing or greater mass appeal. There is a dreariness to the design of ARRIVAL, but this wet, misty grayness perfectly fit the story. What really boosted this movie to a higher level was the fine acting by Amy Adams, Forest Whitaker and the rest of the cast. Yes, ARRIVAL is a bit slow moving, and although the musical score is beautiful, it was a little too present and insistent for my taste. Those were my main criticisms. I also wish the film makers had taken a cue from Hitchcock and sprinkled the script with a good dose of humor. But being a serious attempt at getting at some fundamental human questions, which have never been simple - how we communicate with those who don't speak - or think in - our own language, how we relate to time, our past and our future, how we overcome our deepest most common fears in order to avert human disasters - well these things probably left little room for jokes or sight gags. <br/><br/>Those of you who have seen this film and liked it, I urge you to read the ""Trivia"" section on ARRIVAL, which includes a lot of clues and information as to how the writers and the rest of the creative team packed the script with references to other stories, movies, characters and their names, and even vintage television. This section enriched my understanding of this work."

"FelixMH","6","2","6","1 February 2017"," Ambiguous, unfulfilled, riddled with idealistic/philosophical messages, and tries too hard to be thought-provoking.
","If you didn't like Villeneuve's critically acclaimed Enemy, chances are you didn't like Arrival either. For something packaged as a Sci-fi blockbuster, Arrival is really good at building up the audience's expectation for a satisfying climax using established alien-invasion tropes. However, the movie then proceeds to completely shatter this expectation with an anti-climactic and overtly philosophical ending.<br/><br/>The recent trend toward a more realistic, darker and philosophical take of the Sci-fi genre is welcoming, but this doesn't mean philosophical abstractions and not-so-obvious political and social commentaries are good substitutes for a fulfilling story. Unfortunately, this is exactly what Arrival is. The movie's premise is good, the mysterious atmosphere in its first half is fantastic, but a climax composed mostly of rather forced philosophical messages simply left me disappointed. Similarly, I imagine some Sci-fi fans who went into the theatre expecting to be entertained and thrilled came out confused and unfulfilled."

If you look deep you may notice some protest, even rebel against the reign of positive sciences in every walk of life, and a yearning for place among world's elites. Because this movie exactly depicts this: promotion of a handful of highly educated, highly skilled linguists -Louise being one of them- to top positions in world affairs as only they can make use of a sophisticated language with weapon-like power. Now, this cheesy plot feels like a sure way to a disastrous movie, but here it isn't, thanks to masterful directing and monumental performance of Amy Adams.

","**** May contain strong spoilers ****<br/><br/>This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....<br/><br/>This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.<br/><br/>In some movies (often high rated ones) there is a sense and/or something in the beginning that gives away that this motion picture probably in the view of the majority will hit the rate far up and deliver an extraordinary experience for the viewer. Arrival is one of them. As soon as the melancholic, sad, professional and heavy violin starts off to a voice telling its truth in an almost grieving way, I thought and felt; OK...I got it... here they start off with great expectations. This is going to be one of those....<br/><br/>Arrival is the movie about extra terrestrial contact through 12 enormous air crafts from the universe making it's way to earth. Displaying a interpreters' work in speaking with them. This is intact. This is interesting. This is tense. And for them that are interested in an innovative experience. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) travels through emotional and logic senses trying to solve the language to get to the point: What is your purpose here? <br/><br/>A beautiful, thoughtful and slow paced motion picture about contact and visitation of another life form from... somewhere. Made with such grace and deep feeling that it up rises a different new type of era in the ""science fiction"" genre... or...how long will it be science fiction? Just the scene with the explosion done in some kind of caring harmony is telling the tale of what I mean.<br/><br/>The production has blended heavy and sentimental every day drama with near and authentic emotion together with a high sensitivity and social description; the explained is on edge and almost done to perfection.<br/><br/>After less than half the movie, I thought that maybe it could be the daughter reincarnated/continued into an extra terrestrial that came to Louise in Costello. I was wrong... or...wait....was I?<br/><br/>Halfway through Arrival, one thing came to my mind frequently. If this movie has the authentic and serious way of wanting to convey the both excitement, entertainment and the continuing on the path of making the film near to grasp, the picture should have a solid ending.<br/><br/>The way Arrival contemplates the special ""sixth sense and wonderful talents/gifts"" of human beings is remarkable and astonishing! What is out there for us to learn? Is life so much more than our body here and now?<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve, Eric Heisserer and Ted Chiang has taken a different and innovative turn of events in telling this unique (and at the same time ""good old genre"") story. Done with a sense of realism, drama and a vast tension that is all over the screen, through the audio field and in the experience. Entertaining to a high degree. <br/><br/>Some great dialogue throughout Arrival: Louise Banks: How about if we just talk to them before we start throwing math problems at them?<br/><br/>Ian Donnelly: It is a good story. Louise Banks: Thanks! It is not true, but it proves my point.<br/><br/>Louise Banks: What should we call them? Ian Donnelly: How about Abbott and Costello?<br/><br/>About the dialogue, I really want to give a little pun for the story, for you all to discover; Sheena Easton, is the arrival of your future past for your eyes only?<br/><br/>I immediately was hooked by Arrival, both for the product itself and also (as written about before in my reviews) because the story and meaning itself went straight to my heart and mind.<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Audio; those dark and bass oriented sounds that almost could be as vast alarms and growling sirens brings another huge dimension to the movie; very good done and great collected! The audio is very close and done with more than excellent precision; close your eyes and listen to all the little sounds and effects about 27 minutes into Arrival; amazing! Visual: top notch. All those colours! Look at the innocent and clear white and orange as the team is leaving and entering the ""ship"". A feast for your eyes (or is it pun intended; ""A feast for sore eyes... for your eyes only?"")! The environments inside the ""aircraft"" is fresh, simple and very tasteful... almost artistic. Strong, authentic and straight forward and honest dialogue. - The actors : Golden Globe nominations. Further questions? - Entertainment : Wow. That is a word I said out loud as the team entered the vessel; the artificial ""flash light"" is thrown up and lands on the wall as it is the floor. Then there is weightlessness and hefty breathing... what is happening? Recommendation? Yes. Why and how? Clear your senses and be opened minded. Arrival has arrived and with the arrival arrives a different kind of twist on the whole ""they're here"" topic. This is well done. This is a film for those who appreciate extra terrestrial movies, and with that a slow paced and thoughtful one. Otherwise; look for something else. - Age : 11<br/><br/>8,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 9 Brilliant and admirable 8 Excellent movie and a solid production)"

","In an age in which movie makers seem to be completely devoid of creativity and new ideas, every once in a while a movie comes along that demonstrates that it is still possible to make them without selling out to tired story lines, remakes, and cheap gimmicks. The best movies are based on books and Arrival is no exception. By attacking basic thought processes about communication, language, and dealing with the unknown, Arrival forces the viewer to visit some of the things we do that are so basic that we've forgotten the details about how they work and how flawed they can be. This is a thinker's movie; one I'll have to watch several times to fully wrap my brain around the details.<br/><br/>While some of the world's responses to the visitors seems a bit over the top, it isn't detrimental since it serves to keep an otherwise deep story line moving along."

We left 3/4 of the way through and went home to watch 1997's ""Contact"". Really I feel that in today's world with the huge catalogue of sci fi films and books available that someone with the resources to make such a visually stunning film could actually make something which excites the imagination as opposed to this grey pebble of a movie.

He simply isn't interesting- he's funny, but never really goes beyond that.<br/><br/>Second Act- A plot device in the second act is a little lazy, and the audience doesn't really get to see how things play out. It doesn't hurt the film too much in the end, but it is the only part of the movie with plot-based flaws.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Arrival is a fantastic film by a fantastic director. If you let this movie play out, and wait for the payoff, you will be well rewarded. Arrival, for me, doesn't quite beat out Prisoners (a nearly perfect movie), but takes second place away from Sicario. Follow this director; he is reliably interesting and fresh. Even though it has a few flaws, they don't take away from all of the excellence throughout. 9/10."

","By far one of the best films of the year. Captures you emotionally and demonstrates the true nature of our lack of humanity. True depiction of We are afraid of what we do not understand. If you're looking for an energetic sci-fi thriller like Independence Day you won't find it here, don't get me wrong I love Independence Day but this is more of a cerebral complex resemblance to signs. I have always loved sci-fi films; yet what most consist of is over the top visual effects and not much substance behind their plots and building a connection with the characters, however you grow fond of the characters and you feel their bond. It's a great film overall."
"Hopstimop","7","2","6","14 November 2016"," A wannabe deep movie
","Very slow paced, trying too hard to be deep and dramatic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think it's that good as everybody tries to make it.<br/><br/>My reference for deep and meaningful sci-fi story telling is Contact with Jodie Foster. That movie has so many layers and so many things to say and so many characters to transport the messages (because Contact has many), while this one has one simple message, which is milked to death already: work together for a better life and future instead of fighting each other.<br/><br/>And that message is brought to you on a lower grade school class level. What I mean? The world is divided into 12 parts and every part gets some data, which they have to share with each other and put together to get the result that probably will save humanity(?).<br/><br/>Just like when the teacher splits the class into groups for a school project and every group has to solve a partial task and put together their results to get the answer.<br/><br/>This movie is just like Interstellar. A pseudo intellectual movie for half informed book-smart people, so they feel themselves good for understanding and enjoying it while their ""dumb"" friends complain about it.<br/><br/>I don't even start on things, like ""how exactly would learning a language change how you experience time"" and ""why does everybody act like they would carry the problems of the world on their shoulders, when they have absolutely no reason to do so from their point of view""or ""how doesn't she remember in the future what she said in the past to arrive in that future until another person in the future tells her what to say in the past to get into that future""."

","Despite the sci-fi/alien appearance of Arrival, there are many aspects of human life addressed delicately in this movie.
Beside the incredible regard to ""language"" in our world and how much it can be important, complex and intertwined with our thoughts and dreams, I think the key feature of the movie, is that one dimension that we're still trying to crack up; TIME! The main question for our linguistic (Amy Adam's character), is not the matter of how to communicate with aliens, but rather how much she's going to change her life decisions when future is revealed to her? So, does it still worth to live through all the pain, when you know how it's going to end?<br/><br/>Also, there were so many moments that I was just astonished by the amazing shots, like when the spaceships vanished into awesome clouds, that made me appreciate the CGI work behind this extraordinary movie very much.<br/><br/>Like ""Sicario"" and ""Prisoners"", Denis Villeneuve successfully transferred stress and tension throughout the movie, yet without the guns and violence, and definitely didn't let me keep my eyes off the screen for a moment!
Can't wait to see his other movies!"
"Sir Gerry","8","1","2","3 March 2020"," Words create reality
","I don't think this movie is about that ""what makes us human"". Personally I think it is about creating your own reality. The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (""For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned""). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully."

In contrast, circular characters emerge at once, connecting the beginning and the end. It means that Heptapods don't have the concept of time.<br/><br/>As Louise interacts with the Heptapods, a new way of thinking and vision are brought into her.<br/><br/>I think Louise wanted to cherish the present, even if she was aware of the future.

","My Rating : 9/10<br/><br/>The first time seeing 'Arrival' in a theater confused and bored me to death and I couldn't understand anything having lost interest mid-way - also I wasn't such a cinephile 2 years ago. But a second viewing completely changed everything! Kudos to the film for surprising me so beautifully and keeping me fully engaged!<br/><br/>How would I describe it? It's a hybrid of 'The Tree of Life' and 'Interstellar' except not as expansive - it's very minimal - though extremely well-edited to have maximum impact.<br/><br/>It's more a fairy-tale for adults using interesting concepts of time, language and adding in aliens because aliens are cool and intelligent. Yes, there is some suspension of disbelief required on part of the viewer to ignore the plot holes and cliches, so if you're able to 'buy into' the fairy tale you're in for a philosophical, emotional ride.<br/><br/>Using communication and the idea of how as people we are limited in our understanding of the world because of 'thinking' in a particular language 'Arrival' explores our fundamental reason for existence - Why are WE here and what if we had the ability to see the future what would we do and how would we live and make choices going forward? Would we change anything along the way or not?<br/><br/>Honestly, I am really overjoyed at having seen this movie - it really offers the viewer a variety of perspectives - the movie is like the heptapod and we the audience playing the protagonist and figuring out how it all fits in our own lives!<br/><br/>Brilliant piece of filmmaking. The only reason it's not getting a 10/10 is because of some plotholes which are kind of cringe if you know what I mean."

","Ambiguous, serious, thoughtful - this film may be slow-paced, but at no point was I bored. In my view, the science was mostly plausible; the fact that it wasn't entirely plausible was made up for, in my opinion, by the uniqueness of the ideas dealt with in the film, when compared to others of similar genre. As some other reviews say, this film is about aliens, but it is also about language, communication and the incredible differences in perception that could exist between different species. I think this last point could be explored even further than is done so in the film.<br/><br/>At the time of writing, Arrival has an Amazon rating of 3.5 stars - I'm used to filtering through things to watch based on their rating, so this almost slipped my view. I'm glad it didn't. I'm now reconsidering the weighting I place on average ratings - a director who is brave enough to do something different will tend to get quite a few low ratings as well as high ones, just by virtue of the experimental nature of their work. (In this regard, I see parallels to Blade Runner: 2049, which I saw before Arrival, and was actually quite a fan of, although I like Arrival even better.)"

"Dr_Coulardeau","8","1","2","1 February 2018"," Too much honey on the cherry on top of the cake
","The best of this trilogy of science fiction films for the end. This film is in many ways a very good film that deals with the arrival of aliens on earth and their first contact with human beings. It shows a little bit of the panic it creates on earth, like the evangelists and other apocalyptic prophets who announce the end of this world; then the jingoist bigots who require the extermination of these aliens from the very start to protect the human species. ETC. There is no end to human folly. <br/><br/>But at this level of the human response to twelve alien space crafts levitating in twelve places in the world, the film shows how easy the jingoists can win. The American side that started an intelligent mission to communicate with the aliens thanks to the help and competence of a linguist and a physicist, is also the first one shown as trying to blow up the spacecraft, which fails because the aliens detect the explosive and neutralize the bombs that explode within the spacecraft but with no damage caused.<br/><br/>The film insists on the fact that China, then Russia, then Sudan and Pakistan (I might be wrong on this fourth one) want to destroy the space crafts because they apparently misunderstood a message in the alien language and script. Only the American side of the linguistic communication is provided, though the film alludes to linguistic experts on the Chinese side. It is funny because the writing system is what looks like absolutely arbitrary scribbles and ink stains. The linguist manages to make everyone understand that these circles are words, and the physicist using some software manages to isolate some of these words, though we might think that a circle could be more than one concept and thus be a sentence.<br/><br/>But it is when that communication is becoming successful that the paranoia wins in the American camp as well and as fast as in the other camps in the world. It is an impossible and incredible act of rebellion of the linguist that avoids the worst end possible. She steals the phone of the top commander of the camp on the American site and she calls the General, head of the Chinese Liberation Army, and tells him what she thinks about the communication, and it all in Chinese, which is, of course, an advantage over all the military personnel who speaks one language, and even so quite often a dialect of this language, i.e. English. The effect is immediate. The Chinese general steps back and the military confrontation is avoided.<br/><br/>The end is a marshmallow in a fire. It melts down to some kind of sloppy sweet honey-covered soft candy and the aliens just dissolve their space crafts into thin air. And they go away. That's what I call real adventurous explorers. Then some mellow personal ending and touch to have the good Hollywoodian - or should I say Hollywoodistic, or even Hollywoosadistic - happy ending with love, marriage, birth, etc. <br/><br/>But remember! In all vast questions, it is always the linguist - especially if the linguist is a woman and if possible a structuralist - who knows better for a simple reason: there is no science if an articulated language does not exist FIRST. How could Homo Sapiens conceive the concept of ZERO if he did not have a language that had permitted his conceptualization power to develop? And the Mayas, the Chinese and later the Arabs, but probably some anterior communities in the Middle East, developed that ZERO without any communication among them, at least for the Chinese and the Mayas who did it first. And that ZERO will be imported into Europe by Descartes in the 17th century: ""al gèbre"" as he called it.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

I would like to make a counterpoint with my personal story, very well, when I was looking for motivational videos, still very young, it was common to feel lost, even more with by the type of creation I was subjected to, so i was looking for something that would serve me as elucidation. to help me get somewhere, to help me believe, so i found a video subtitled because it is North American and also because I am south american, naturalized Brazilian and had a very tenuous knowledge about the Anglo-Saxon language, well, as I had said, when i watched this video and i listen a voice that seemed familiar to me, not only did it look like it was! The icon behind it? nothing less than Steve Jobs, founder of one of today's largest companies.<br/><br/>I stopped, and I listened attentively to the sign that passed and said exactly like this: ""You can not connect the dots looking forward; you can only turn them on by looking back. So you have to trust that the points will connect sometime in the future. You have to trust in something - your instinct, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach never disappointed me, and it made all the difference in my life"". So this not only made a difference to him, but I believe that for all who have listened to him and believe in these words. <br/><br/>I always believed that the words are very powerful, and we must be careful, for they have powers hitherto unknown to us humans, they are responsible for all kinds of communication, the communication that allows us to teach, which convey a tremendous emotional charge, many deep-seated feelings, Jesus said to love one another and, is there a better way to do this than to rid our brothers of chaos, confusion, and consequently destruction? The language sometimes confuses our thoughts, they limit us in all aspects.<br/><br/>I am not surprised at the importance of being buried after the separation in the tower of Babel, we must ""understand ourselves"" before we can correct ourselves, there is no way to solve the ""PROBLEM"" without first understanding it, therefore communication makes this fundamental, unite the dots""."

I'm not a great fan of slimey alien encounters but here they don't overstay thier welcome and alow plenty of time for contemplation and the overarching humanity and compassion that dominates this story. So unusually for an invasion-type movie there is time and screen space devoted to long languorous sections for thought and releflection and visual allusion that reminds me of Tarkovsky's Solaris, and even Terence Malick's The Tree of Life.

","Unlike most sci-fi, alien, movies - this one is intelligent and thought-provoking. It is more of a slow-cooked pulled pork in style, rather than popcorn popping action, yet watching it are two very well spent hours of your life.<br/><br/>The story - at least as it appears initially - is centered around the arrival of several alien spaceships, and the need to interact and understand not only with them, but also with the other countries of the world. The question of who's to trust is of course there as an important plot point. There are however, a few other subtle, but yet key, pieces in the story that aren't obviously detectable, so anyone looking for some Marvel / Star Wars / Star Trek action should look for some other movie.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie nods more at 2001 or Close encounter of the third kind (1977), or even the 1979's Alien, than contemporary action sci-fi movies. Yet, the tension is constant and powerful, through the careful use of photography and audio. Due to the latter, a surround-system with a good sub is required for the full effect.

All the while global military forces stand amassed on highest hair-trigger alert-status with Thermonuclear counter-strike at the ready should the inscrutable extraterrestrials exhibit even the slightest sign of belligerence.<br/><br/>**spoiler-Alert** Amy Adams appreciates the fact that her powers of translation must by unerringly-accurate and uncannily-intuitive if there is any chance of averting devastating-conflagration on a global-scope.  This uniquely-intriguing film not only showcases meticulous attempts at communication with mysteriously-perplexing (but still quite believable) complex-cosmic Life-forms, but also features heartrending dreamlike scenes of Amy Adams' brief but poignant interactions with her daughter (at different stages of life-cycle and differing ages) feeling akin to poetic vignettes and flashes of insight that always occur just as Adams' character is on the verge of some new revelation with regards to a breakthrough in communicating with the extraterrestrials.<br/><br/>There is also astonishing narrative-progression inherent to this story revealing the cosmic travelers' true intentions along with their uncanny abilities to perceive time & space, encouraging the human viewer to deeply reflect on the fragile + tenuous nature of our own existence, ruminating on how misunderstandings in current Geo-political perspectives of human communication and breakdowns in those information-avenues among nations could easily initiate global calamity and devastation for us all.  <br/><br/>The heightened sensitively to 'space & Time' presented in ""Arrival' could also prompt viewers to reflect on the priceless-value inherent within each precious moment of  'Life' and the importance of cherishing each & every indelible interaction, no matter how brief.  The film ""Arrival' is filled with an abundance of imagination, opening our hearts & minds to fascinating possibilities and potentials (which Amy Adams and Director Denis Villeneuve make quite believable)."

","Arrival has been widely praised for it's visuals, storytelling and performances from its leads Amy Adams and Jeremy Renners. As usual with films that are widely praised from critics, there are its share of audience and movie goers overreacting about how they dislike the film. Arrival is not the typical science fiction film with much action and explosions, and moments of suspense. It does feature great acting and is more of a slower paced drama. It appears people were expecting an 'alien vs humans' battle type film which this isn't. With that being said, after a while of watching the film, it did become to drag on and some parts became quite boring to watch. <br/><br/>Those reviews saying 'there is no plot' weren't paying attention and should be avoided.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","4","18","27 November 2016"," Not a lot wrong with this film, very tense watch
","""Arrival"" is an American English-language movie from this year (2016) and the newest production from rising Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve. The writer is Eric Heisserer and he has been mostly known so far for the new version of ""The Thing"". Here he adapted once again the work for somebody else, namely Ted Chiang, who is responsible for ""Story of Your Life"", the original literary work this film is based on. The movie we have here runs for almost two hours and features Amy Adams as one of the world's most renowned translators. Next to her, we see Jeremy Renner as a successful scientist and Oscar winner Forest Whitaker as a military commander. But sadly, the latter two are not given the material to work with in terms of the acting level they possess. It is really all about Adams' character and the story of course, the rest are just side aspects. We also find out a lot about her, in terms of her job, her personal life, her past etc. right the way you would expect it for a central character. Then, relatively quickly, the story progresses and we find out about the alien invasion and how Adams' character gets called to duty and has to help the government in finding out what the aliens want exactly, if they are on a peaceful mission or on a not-so-peaceful one.<br/><br/>As a whole, I really enjoyed the watch here. One thing I did not like early on was the reference about the main character's daughter as it felt randomly thrown in as a somewhat tragic side story, but as we find out at the very end, it is much more than that and I can forgive the makers for including these scenes early on. Actually the ending almost made me appreciate these scenes. What I did not appreciate, however, was also almost at the very end, namely the scene of how she manages to have an impact on the radical Chinese military leader's decision and I really did not like this plot development. Her character was significant enough already, so no need to let her solve what can easily be considered a global military crisis, especially as they said on several occasions that other countries would follow his example. But not so Adams' character. She does the right thing. Honestly, this all sounds a bit pseudo-dramatic to me and over the top. This also refers to Michael Stuhlbarg's character in my opinion. I think he is a really gifted actor, but the role of the unlikable colleague is so underwhelmingly written here and the moment he points his gun at her is really as disappointing and stereotypical as it gets. I wish they could have sorted this stuff out. But like I said earlier, the good still easily outweighs the bad. And I will elaborate on this a bit in the next paragraph.<br/><br/>I think the general idea is pretty brilliant. Several spaceships come to planet Earth and we (the earthlings) have no idea what they want or if they have good or bad intentions. The scenes in front of the glass are also really amazing, even if I struggled a bit with the scientists being able to communicate so effortlessly quickly. Anyway, it's a science fiction film after all and I can deal with the less realistic stuff. Visually this was a feast and audibly the film delivered too. And it was also pretty atmospheric, which is really crucial with the subject. The atmosphere is the one aspect that carries the film and I was genuinely curious about what would happen next, not just to Adams' character, but to mankind as a whole. So yeah, with this performance Adams catapults herself into the elite of Hollywood actresses under 45 (if she hadn't been there already anyway). The script is very strong too and these minor struggles at times aren't bad enough to destroy the film as a whole, only to keep it from being a great film and one of the year's very best. It still is a strong achievement and I applaud everybody involved. You really wanna see it, especially if you love alien-themed movies. It's not as good as my favorite from the genre, ""District 9"", but honestly, it comes pretty close at times. Now stop reading these words and experience ""Arrival"" yourself. You won't be disappointed."

","As Amy Adams' opening voice-over speaks in sad lyrical strokes, and director Denis Villenueve's lens slides slowly through her empty home, and Johann Johannson's mournful music breathes in the background, we know we're not watching Independence Day. <br/><br/>Adams plays Louise, a linguist seemingly grieving for her daughter. Louise is last to know that twelve colossal spacecraft have entered the Earth's atmosphere and are now hovering in various locations around the globe. Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker), who has a bit of previous with Louise, invites her to join a team who will enter one of the alien crafts and try to communicate with them. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is set largely in a military base in the shadow of the alien craft. The camera meekly moves beneath the huge hovering object, as if anxiously averting its eyes. The sense of awe is palpable and appropriate, filling the audience with a thrilling dread as the crew creep – and float – inside. The sparse design of the alien ship interior is fantastically foreboding, and the form of its pilots is convincing in its otherworldliness. I won't describe them; I'll just say they're named ""heptapods"". <br/><br/>The humans attempt to communicate. While Louise uses words and gestures, the heptapods rely on a kind of hieroglyphic language made from ejected ink. It's pleasingly weird and graceful. These first encounters are the most engaging, successfully giving the sense of an impenetrable barrier between species. <br/><br/>Fans of modern epic sci-fi won't be bowled over by the core message, but I won't name names for fear of giving away the mildest of surprises.<br/><br/>The sombre colour-drained style may be standard these days, but Villenueve contrasts it effectively with Louise's memories of her daughter. The editing throughout the film is textured and nuanced, even if it does collapse into a malaise of generalised Big Feelings in the end. Still, the quality of craftsmanship and the doomy style bode well for the director's upcoming Blade Runner sequel. <br/><br/>For all the heavyweight actors, the supporting characters – from the gruff, pragmatic military leader to the slimy CIA suit – are stock for the genre. Adams is typically soulful and skillful, while Renner, to his credit, tries his best in a role written to be playful, except he's under the thrall of a director who doesn't really do play. <br/><br/>Arrival isn't completely cohesive. There's some of the hard sci-fi slog of The Andromeda Strain, but also the socially conscious grandstanding of The Day the Earth Stood Still. Both are great movies (and both by Robert Wise) – but are they great bedfellows?<br/><br/>Tonally I was reminded of Another Earth, a similarly mournful, cerebral sci-fi movie with a metaphysical twist. But that movie wore its melon-twisting conceit on its sleeve, as opposed to the Nolan- esque puzzle box narrative gradually unveiled in Arrival. As twists go, this one is ambitious: a clever cop-out or a mind-expanding revelation depending on taste. Your capacity for feeling moved may depend on your feelings about the bow-wrapped ending of Interstellar. <br/><br/>Along with Interstellar, a major touchstone is Robert Zemeckis's Contact, which also focused on a passionate female protagonist driven by grief. Contact's depiction of an invaded world swallowing itself whole through reactionary insanity was more fun and more convincing, although I guess the overblown public reaction in Arrival may speak more to the current feverish state of US politics. <br/><br/>Arrival suffers from many familiar elements, and a script that can't match the sumptuous visual style, the committed performances, or the unique production design. Perhaps a little more lightness of touch may have alleviated the slippery slope of the film's neat-yet- divisive second half. But there's no denying that this is impressive, technically astounding filmmaking with an unapologetic intention to awe. Worth seeing – and worth seeing BIG."

"rabbitmoon","5","3","12","1 November 2016"," A great movie - but not more than the sum of its parts
","As Arrival begins, you're led down that familiar path of a Villeneuve film: the dread-laden music, thoughtful cinematography, subtlety and pace imply something deeply intelligent and thoughtful is about to happen. Amy Adam's character is framed within various geometrical patterns and structures - the circular corridors of a hospital, the curved seats of a lecture hall, the square geometry of her house, a TV frame, her University building. She's surrounded by controlled patterns. This makes the arrival of the abstract orbs even more stunning, we're being asked to see something ""new"" in terms of the films language. <br/><br/>And that's essentially what Arrival hinges on - the film asks the audience to decipher its own cinematic language, whilst Louise (Adams) deciphers the aliens language. Will you have the same emotional journey that Louise does? Villeneuve clearly hopes so - but that all depends entirely on how much the film pulls you in emotionally.<br/><br/>But its just a 'movie'. Entertainment. Beyond that, its ideas and ponderings don't have much substance - there's no real emotional insight, take-home message, honesty about the human condition or anything else to really chew on beyond a few reflective thoughts. This isn't Tarkovsky, its not even classic sci-fi. Its more like an extended Twilight Zone or Black Mirror episode. <br/><br/>I think the thing that makes it seem more intelligent/emotional than it actually is, is the clever use of flashbacks. Whenever I see this in a film (notably Nolan's Insomnia, Batman Begins, Prestige, Inception, Interstellar, who I feel Villeneuve has been influenced by) it has a powerful effect - juxtaposing some current situation with some whimsical emotional moment. But the emotions here feel forced - we're not dealing with the nuance of human nature, its that broad-strokes Hollywood kind of 'emotional' that feels more like a cute idea that anything real. <br/><br/>It just doesn't really add up to anything more than the sum of its (admittedly very good) parts. My challenge to any of its fans is this - what is the film really about? Any great film should have a few interesting answers to that question. With Arrival, I'm struggling to find an honest answer that does justice to the quality of the production."

","It is a little hard to comment much on this film without making it a spoiler. The three principal actors, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whittaker all turned in good performances. The film is not invested too heavily in special effects, but they are done well, as is the rest of the cinematography. I feel like they had to work too hard on the central conceit, and the scenes of Adams' character with her daughter dragged down the pace.

"pervocrat","6","2","7","6 July 2017"," Great ideas, thoughtful story... limp execution
","This is an extremely beautiful film and, like much of Villeneuve's work, focuses on ideas to do with humanity, the nature and extent of human experience, and how we can become something bigger than we are. <br/><br/>I loved the idea of humans trying to communicate with a non-linear species that experiences time, thought, and language differently to us, but the explorations of how that really works and would impact both species felt underdeveloped, and I would have liked to see less focus on Louise's motherhood as an illustration and more on the actual mechanics of the plot. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is underused as physicist Ian Donnelly, who doesn't seem to do any actual theoretical physics, and several opportunities to engage with global political, military, and governmental tensions feel glossed over, allowing the movie to become reliant on 'alien invasion sci-fi' tropes such as TV news footage of cranks and outbreaks of panic. <br/><br/>The crux of the aliens' gift also feels like a letdown, too redolent of a million instances of ""the real treasure was knowledge all along!"", though the script does try to underscore the importance of Louise's adjusted thinking and to fully convey its effects. <br/><br/>Great ideas and mostly very good performances from a finely tuned and sensitive cast, but Arrival feels like much more of an appetiser than a main course; an ultimately frustrating movie that promises much but delivers unevenly and with a number of plot holes and inconsistencies. They *are* very good ideas, however."

","This movie has been a blow of fresh air. It is not the typical alien invasion movie. If you are looking for some action kind of ""War of the Worlds"" or ""Spaceship Troopers"" go find something else. This is not your movie. This goes beyond that, to infinity and beyond, as Buzz Lightyear would say.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the apparition of 12 alien vessels arriving at different point on Earth (of course one is on the USA, where else?). The military then contact Amy Adam's linguistic in order to help to establish contact with the alien and learn why are they here and what they want. With her is Jeremy Runner's physic helping with the scientific side. So having this established, the movie then flows into a more scientific-human way to approach the issue than what we are used in Mr Bay's movies or as Leeloo from the ""Fifth Element"" would say: ""big bada boom"". No big bada boom or booms. The point is understanding what they want before shooting; something we aren't that used to in this kind of science fiction movies.<br/><br/>As in all sci-fi movies visual effects are one actor more and in this one the effects are well created and made with extra care. But of course visual effects without music it like a pizza without cheese, tasteless. The music and the sound effects play and important role in this movie because that is what we are trying to decipher: what are they saying. Needless to say both main actors keep the movie at its best specially Amy Adams (when is she going to win an Oscar please?). As usual, she is fantastic and she can transmit to the audience the weight she has in her shoulders as the interpreter between humanity and the aliens. She is THE protagonist of the movie. Nor the aliens and definitely no one else.<br/><br/>This movie tries to reach to you and make you think, not only about what would happen if we were contacted or visited from another species from outer Space, but also it makes you think about humanity as a whole, about life, about your destiny. What would you do?"
"ischwensen","10","2","7","16 May 2017"," Considering all First Contact movies - this is it
","It's been a long time since I rated a movie with a 10, or even a 9, here on IMDb. But a lot of the reviews show, how a sizable number of people were disappointed, or even angered, by 'Arrival'. The reason that so many viewers were really put off by this movie, while many others praise it enthusiastically, stems from the fine line it walks. If it doesn't suit you from the start, you've got two long hours to get quite mad. A fine line: Not much happening in this film, on the other hand - and following my experience of the movie - a rewarding story-line pushed energetically forward. Oftentimes seemingly lifeless, shot in mostly dull colors, the sparse action oriented parts playing out mostly off screen, or transmitted only via news broadcasts ... What's to like? Well, in my opinion, a lot. Starting with the nuanced, and very humane, performance of Amy Adams, the fitting soundtrack (but no engulfing/immersing orchestral music, actually not much ""music music"" at all), the elegantly weighed photography, but most of all the serene calmness of an intense revelation story at the center of this very intelligent film. I felt like I was taken by the hand and guided by this movie while its grand design unfolded without making a fuss of it. Enough bad poetry: considering the many movies that have hitherto tackled the theme of First Contact, and there were some good ones among them, that I still like to watch, 'Arrival' is now by far the best take there is on this sub-genre with its sometimes proud, and sometimes also very funny, history. That said, I really understand people disliking this movie. If it doesn't get a hold of someone, I'm afraid, there's no redemption to be had with him or her for 'Arrival'. Those who haven't seen it yet, just give it a try."
"raa-55017","9","2","7","15 May 2017"," Science Fiction Masterpiece
","Arrival, from the look of all the trailers, seems like a typical Sci-Fi film with not much under the surface. This could not be farther from the truth. Arrival blew every single one of my expectations away and became my favorite movie of 2016. While it begins with the cliché aliens-come-to-earth- for-an-unknown-reason gig, Arrival then unfolds into a complex, intellectual film about the purpose and plan of human beings and their interactions on this planet. The story revolves around Dr. Louise Banks, a linguistics professor portrayed masterfully by Amy Adams, who is recruited by the government to help communicate with the twelve alien spaceships that have landed in random locations around the globe. While the concept comes off as simple, the techniques by which the filmmakers execute the communication elevate this movie to brilliant levels. Visually, the movie is breathtaking. Large, beautiful shots are used throughout the run time in addition to great color and sound design. The film addresses motives such as fate, loss and love while still providing an entertaining thrill ride with well-developed characters. I cannot list off the top of my head one thing I would change with this movie; it's execution and emotional payoff worked wonders."
"hkfilmbuff","7","2","7","13 May 2017"," Just remember this is science fiction
","For a generation who has probably never even heard of Fellini or Antonioni, this could well be a confusing or boring film. For those who find it appealing, do try to read the original story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang. <br/><br/>Flashbacks have become common practice in movie making. Admittedly, flashbacks sometimes made a film, but the technique has been over- used in the last decade in attempts to elevate the ""artistic"" element in movie making. In ""Arrvial"", such segments are in fact not flashbacks per se. One of the key idea in the movie (as well as the short story it was based upon) is about our own conception of time (and time ""travel"", into the future). The most significant verbal interchange in the entire movie occurred early in the movie, between the characters played by Renner and Adams, that brought up the Sapir- Whorf hypothesis, that language could potentially be what constrains our thoughts, and thus our intellectual, psychological, and sociological endeavours.<br/><br/>Ted Chiang, as I remember vaguely, has written elsewhere about the possibility of a language which is deterministic, in the sense that the first ""word"" uttered could determine the entire ""sentence"" to come. I think he was drawing on certain logographic/pictorial language that tells an entire story with one ""picture"" - in the film, they made an attempt to portray how they decipher the alien language, showing the ""translated"" English words around the alien symbols. (Notice also that the aliens did not trace/draw those symbols in a sequential fashion, the entire symbols somehow resolved from some ""random"" swirl of ink, and when Adams tried to mimic the symbol, she said she couldn't do it using both hands - because she was conditioned to a sequential mode of language processing.) I think Chiang's original idea, which the movie also attempted to capture, was the notion of a nonlinear dimension of time, which hinted at the aliens' ability to somehow ""forsee"" the future - they told Adams that they were trying to help humans now so that we humans can in turn help them when they will be in trouble in a few thousands years. <br/><br/>Adams, having been initiated into the alien language, no longer perceived time in a linear fashion, hence all the apparent flashbacks, which were merely snippets of her consciousness which were no longer bound by the normal progression of time. In Chiang's short story, Adams was writing/telling the story of her child's life (before it was born) when the future was already ""known"" to her, which hearkens back to what she said in the movie about ""...despite knowing the journey... and where it leads... I embrace it. And I welcome every moment of it.""<br/><br/>All in all, I think this is a well-made movie, with some novel ideas (for a change). Amy Adams did a great job portraying the protagonist - it WAS her movie. Jeremy Renner was believable in a supporting role. The bit about non-zero-sum game and international cooperation is a welcome message in today's polarizing world politics and religious fanaticism. One could also surmise the fact that Adam's character was ""blessed"" with the ""gift(weapon)"" of the alien's language was due to her willingness to approach them, first by taking off her protective suit, and subsequently in running out to the alien ship when the evacuation order was issued - here is a faint echo of Chiang's notion that an initial gesture (word) can determine the course/outcome of an entire interaction (sentence), from the start. <br/><br/>A final word for those who voted thumbs down outright: our ability (including my own) to comprehend this movie, or the original story of Chiang, might well be tempered by our own individual linguistic idiosyncrasies. A movie to be watched more than once."
"Mr-Fusion","8","2","7","12 May 2017"," This really leaves a lasting impression
","It's your classic tale of alien visitors; where are they from and why are they here? But there's a subtlety to ""Arrival"" that makes it stand out, even while it's drawing comparisons to the wonder and mystery of grander films (""Close Encounters"", ""2001""). The military maintains a sizable presence in the movie, but it never really gets to that hysterical point (sure, the planet's armed forces are ready to go to war, but there's also a surprising level of restraint). And I liked that the real focus was on communication, not just with the aliens, but also between our sovereign nations.<br/><br/>There is a surprise at the end (I don't think twist is the right word because that evokes Shyamalan, and this isn't that movie), and to a certain extent, that's really the point of the movie - even though it's handled with depth and sensitivity. But up until that point, this is Amy Adams' show. I've always liked here, but of her performances, this is one of my favorites. I could compare this to ""Gravity"" and that'd give a good sense of the maternal subject matter - yet it isn't apt because that's not what happens. It's complicated in the best sense of the word.<br/><br/>8/10"

","One could argue that science fiction, in this particular realm of adult thought and understanding, is all just lessons in humanity, exposed quickly on TV through shows like ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Star Trek"", but here further developed into a non-linear experience. It is something beautiful, if not fully understood, but more of a film to experience. Arrival brings a new hero to this genre in the form of Linguistics Professor plucked from her home by the U.S. Military to one of twelve alien landing sites to interpret their intent. The style is deliberate and instructional, but never pandering down, picking up whether others have failed. Amy Adams carries us past a myriad of assumptions and rush to judgments vigilantly. She represents the science of language and it's potential. How can you not get behind that. The atmosphere of this movie is the hidden special effect, not blue screen space wars. That the director brings us the beauty of the challenge faced in the movie should be applauded ...and for those who prefer flying space ships and cool space outfits with blasters, there's a franchise movie awaiting your cash."

","Arrival, directed by Denis Villeneuve, and starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, is an interesting film about first contact with an alien species. The film follows Linguistics professor Louise Banks, as she works with the US government to determine how to communicate with the aliens.<br/><br/>I'll start off by saying this film is a bit of a slow burner. It takes what is really important in the science fiction genre - the wonder of the unknown, the imagination, and the feeling of inferiority in the face of massive ideals, and really nails them. This is one of the best science fiction films I have seen in many years, and may rival my love for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The film has a methodical pace, a cracking ending, and some excellent introspective human elements. Its take on time and space is also very interesting. The film left me frequently at the edge of my seat, as the tension ratcheted up. The movie looks at a plausible scenario for first contact (plausible for the genre, at least). There is very little action in the film, and instead the focus is on learning, adapting and communicating, and follows Louise's character closely through the film, as she struggles with her life, the stress of the job, and a dawning realization of what it means to be a human.<br/><br/>I cannot praise this film enough. It represents hard science fiction at its finest, and is an excellent, terse and concise addition to the genre. It can be easily recommended for fans of science fiction, but those not too into the genre may not feel the same way. Even so, from my perspective, it is a wonderful film, and may in fact become a favourite of mine after a few more watches. A great effort from all involved, and worthy of great attention."

(TIME TRAVEL huh! perhaps there is no correct or wrong way just a WAY!) although to see one's child eventually suffer somewhere along the time frame is a choice i find difficult to comprehend but is a BOLD way to go? unless I have got it very wrong?<br/><br/>The Whitehouse Spokesperson here say ""We have a protocol for a scenario like this"" YES i don't doubt it...Time is closing ;)<br/><br/>It is a sombre (some might even say depressing) looking film with the dark colours but this is why it felt so different and the soundtrack only adds to this feeling with what seemed like whale or dolphin sound signatures? a way of communicating.<br/><br/>It has a couple of messages & they're VERY GOOD ONE's i think...<br/><br/>WE NEED TO LEARN TO GET ON WITH EACH OTHER (perhaps before we can get on with any new alien species) sadly for me I don't see this happening any time as we still have a lot to learn, we are but babies still.<br/><br/>We need to TREASURE & REMEMBER THOSE MOMEMENTS IN TIME that bring happiness, joy, enlightenment & even excitement to us all at times in our lives, these might only be glimpsing for some of us (sadly) but HOLD ONTO THEM DEAR (if at all possible) for they are WHAT MAKES US.<br/><br/>It is a Terrific & Thought provoking picture & one i LOVED.<br/><br/>AMY ADAMS knocked it out of the park with her performance here.<br/><br/>BLADE RUNNER 2049 in GOOD HANDS."

","Contrary to ordinary science fiction films, I guess he tried to be different seen. The idea is really good, but there were some disconnections. Thrown ideas seem to hang when the movie is over. For example, why did they come and why they went? In the future, what they are trying to say in the section? It's uncertain. Amy Adams is play perfect...She took up seriously her role.She's really a lot better now than a real 43-year-old lady She looks young.

"tomsview","9","2","7","25 February 2017"," The answer lies within
","I love the way Denis Villeneuve tackles well-worn genres and stands them on their head. Now I expect that everything he does will be exciting and different: ""Polytechnique"", ""Prisoners"", ""Enemy"" and now ""Arrival"".<br/><br/>I was not so keen on ""Sicario""; it didn't quite get over the bar for me – and Villeneuve set the bar. However ""Arrival"" does, and then some.<br/><br/>Here he has taken on the aliens visiting earth with a message classic, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" – with a touch of old H.G's ""War of the Worlds"" thrown in, and taken the whole thing to a new level.<br/><br/>It's not just special effects; they're good, but they are not the whole show.<br/><br/>When alien spacecraft arrive at many locations on Earth, linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is brought in by the military to try and communicate with them.<br/><br/>The film is absorbing as Louise and a team of scientists slowly interpret the alien's language while also attempting to build trust. All the incidental detail seems pretty much the way you would expect humans to approach an alien arrival with some advocating a peaceful approach and others a preemptive first strike.<br/><br/>What really makes this film hit home is it's emotional depth. Louise has had troubling experiences and these become bound up in her relationship with the aliens.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" has that same insightful quality that was at the heart of Zemeckis' ""Contact"" and Nolan's ""Interstellar"" and also to a degree in Glazer's ""Under the Skin""; they seem to say that the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe is found within oneself.<br/><br/>The sense of spirituality in these films separates them by light years from most special effects laden sci-fi films. Jóhann Jóhannsson's rather impartial score also heightens the atmosphere of ""Arrival"".<br/><br/>It's probably wrong to pigeonhole ""Arrival"" as straight science fiction; one feels that Villeneuve and the filmmakers were striving for something far more profound – I think they succeeded."

"austin0731","8","2","7","11 February 2017"," A great film but viewers should be cautious
","Arrival will be noted as the film of the decade,, ending with a 'shocking twist' that is sure to leave many of the audience shocked. I thought that the film was great, with the exception of some loopholes that are ultimately inevitable in a film of this genre and theme. This film had a great emotional narrative running along the lines of the science fiction line. The acting were brilliant, from Amy Adams to Jeremy Renner all did a fantastic job complimenting each other. I thought that the deep humming music choice was great and set a intense and mysterious undertone. <br/><br/>In the first half of the film our main character is attempting to decipher alien language and it was a very intriguing but ambitious attempt from a movie to try and capture this, as well as very ambitious for the characters in the movie. It was a great insight into language and linguistics, however after one point of the film the gears shifts and now the film enters a position where they deal with time, and specifically how time is nonlinear. This is of course the climax of the film however it is also when the steady pacing of the film becomes quite wonky until eventually imploding into one giant release of sorts.<br/><br/>Upon understanding that the aliens language and thought of time is nonlinear Amy Adams' character starts to be able to see into the future and we understand that the opening scene of the film depicting her and her daughter were actually from the future. Now this is off putting in some ways, because if you really look into this idea you would find yourself asking the question ""why doesn't she just immediately understand everything?"" and of course the means in which her character stops the other countries to call off their attacks on the 'pods' is extremely sketchy and odd. <br/><br/>This film's slower paced first half definitely was an intriguing story while the second half does bring up some questions and plot holes. A friend of mine found this immensely off putting and decided that this completely ruins the film. However as a film I believe that the execution of such complex and theoretical ideas is a good one, the attempt to do so in a narrative fashion is a commendable one, as I have told this friend, ""how else do you expect them to depict a story about nonlinear time within a medium that is one-wayed and linear. Perhaps we are just not ready to take in theories as such that are just not able to be fully grasped by the likes of human as of yet. <br/><br/>One thing that I anticipate will be of significance is this influx of positive reviews, this is because this film does a thing that many films are guilty for, they do a big twist ending with a mass implosion and resolution which masks the idea that this is a great film because of this 'wow factor'. In conclusion I would like to recommend this film but do be cautious in terms of falling into this trap and really think about the film as a whole rather than its surprise ending especially when viewing this particular film."

","This film is so bad it makes Independence Day: Resurgence (2016) look good. No doubt some of the special effects make this film unique, but there is lack of suspense and overall thrill. <br/><br/>This film also fails as a sci-fi action flick. I don't want to go into details about the aliens portrayed in the film- that will spoil it for you if you haven't yet seen the film.<br/><br/>The film starts in flash back about a mother, Louise Banks(Amy Adams) remembering the birth of her daughter. The memories progress till the daughter is a teenager. Then we see that her daughter has contracted a terrible and disease, a form of cancer and she is on her death bed wearing a ventilator mask. She dies.<br/><br/>Then a flashback to the beginning when all was well and the words ""Come back to me,"" uttered by her mother.<br/><br/>Sometime after, twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear across the Earth. Louise, who is a linguist is asked by US Army Colonel Weber(Forest Whitaker) to join a team to find out why they have come. You will have to see the film to find out what happens next.<br/><br/>The film also stars Jeremy Renner alongside Amy Adams. Renner's career has seen him rise from obscurity to one of the most well paid actors in the movie industry. Forrest Whittaker who won the Academy Award, for his role as the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, makes a lackluster presence in the film. So does Jeremy Renner. The main role of the film is of Amy Adams. Though she is a capable actress, I fill the dull script lets her down.<br/><br/>The special effects of the film rapidly become stereotypical and boring. You can compare this film with the Jodie Foster film Contact(1997). I find Contact is a better film, and more so script-wise. The sound-effects of the film are decent but not spectacular. The photography is well handled as well as the direction. <br/><br/>The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve. It based on the short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang. Villeneuve has previously directed the thriller Prisoners(2013) and the action-thriller Sicario(2015). Thank you for reading my review may you live long and prosper.<br/><br/>More alien encounter films to see: Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1978), Alien(1979), The Thing(1982), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Xtro (1982), Lifeforce (1985), Invaders from Mars (1986), The Blob (1988 film), Killer Klowns from Outer Space(1988), Mac and Me (1988), Communion (1989), Metamorphosis: The Alien Factor (1990), Shadowzone(1990), Fire in the Sky (1993).<br/><br/>There are so many more movies but I can't write them all.

I enjoyed Sicario (another film directed by Denis Villeneuve), so I was optimistic.<br/><br/>The basic idea of the film (spaceships arrive, they wait for us to communicate with them, some governments go mental, mass hysteria, etc) seems 'realistic' to me, so for a large part of the film I was engrossed, even though the film moves at a snail's pace.<br/><br/>Throughout the film you are sledgehammered with clues ('Your father is a scientist. SCIENCE! He likes science!'), which eventually build up to the 'reveal'. Personally, I found it a massive disappointment. Trying not to give spoilers, but it sort of invalidates the actions of nearly everyone else in the film.<br/><br/>The slow pace and disappointing ending made this film a gruelling experience.

It's all too absurdly convenient and has very little of the kind of problems we as a species actually have to deal with. I'm tired of this kind of movie. I do want to give it a higher score because it was a genuinely clever film and the portrayal of the international military situation was really timely and spot-on, but come on, the world's real problems don't have much to do with this kind of escapism anymore.

I wanted to see how Humans translated an alien language. This is never properly scrutinized or explained. We see a floating inkblot circle with intricate squiggles around the edges one minute; the next-we see that The Human translators have written many words around these squiggles. I can't recall what actual words they were but similar to Convey-attack-transcend-gullible-uncertain- well you get the picture, many random words, not simple ones. Now, this part of the film would have been fascinating if they had only explained exactly how they actually came to discover the meaning of the seemingly random ink squiggles.

","Scripted by Eric Heisserer based on Story of Your Life, by short-fiction writer Ted Chiang, Arrival is more or less the anti-Independence Day.Arrival boldly snubs the standard alien- invasion vernacular of contemporary movies to explore a mood and language of its own. It may be a touch too subdued for the mainstream, but the movie has brains and originality. Adams gives her best performance as a lonely woman who has to make a decision that will haunt her – though perhaps in a good way – for the rest of her life. Although Arrival is about first contact with extraterrestrials, it says more about the human experience than the creatures from another world. This is a singularly powerful movie, without question one of 2016's best. I go with 4.5/ 5 for Denis Villenueve's another Directorial masterpiece."
"inkblot11","9","3","13","6 December 2016"," Challenging film, with great performance by Adams; most worthwhile
","Louise (Amy Adams) is a professor of linguistics and very well respected. In fact, when the US Army needed some translation of Farsi, she did the task in no time. Yet, it appears she has recently lost her only child, a daughter named Hannah, and the grief is still showing. One day, twelve alien spaceships land on earth, very scattered between the continents. As everyone is apprehensive about their purpose, including those at the university, classes are cancelled indefinitely. Yet, an army officer, Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) shows up at Louise's office once more. With him is a recording of the aliens' language and he wants a translation. Whoa. Telling him she would need much more time and additional tapes, the colonel takes Louise to the spaceship that is in Montana. It is there that she meets an astrophysicist, Ian (Jeremy Renner) and the rest of the crew. Weber informs Louise and Ian that every day, a door of the ship opens for a few hours and they are face to face with the aliens, a many legged being. Thus, Louise and Ian will be front and center in finding a way to communicate with the aliens and, more importantly, find out if they come in peace or destruction. After trying to interpret the whale like sounds, Louise gets another idea. Perhaps they could talk via written language so she brings in a dry erase board. IT WORKS! The aliens are soon making their own circular language patterns. But, as they still need to be decoded completely, will Louise succeed before the rest of the world goes into attack mode? In addition, why is she having strange dreams about her daughter at various stages of her life? This exceptionally challenging and intelligent film is a mind-blower. With nary a light saber in sight, its a fearful yet enchanting meeting of two planetary species. The three main cast members, Adams, Renner and Whitaker, are truly wonderful, especially Adams, who owns the movie. It is her determination, smarts, and empathy that contributes to the search for meaning. Then, too, the alien ships and their beings are wonderfully imaginative, in particular the written alien language. Even so, the ending has to be pondered, as it is deliberately vague. But, for all thoughtful movie fans, Arrival is an immense journey that everyone should take."

","Arrival is a beautifully made, intriguing, suspenseful, and intelligent film. It forgoes the worn-out, overused alien movie script of: Aliens arrive, humans contact aliens, aliens attack humans, humans fight back and win against overwhelmingly stupid odds that seems to come out every other year. Instead, the film asks the question of ""What if extraterrestial life came to Earth NOT to mindlessly kill everything? What if, instead, they came for a mysteriously greater purpose that our two species must learn to communicate in order to understand?"" And it is a question that makes for one constantly tense, suspenseful ride that leaves you uncertain until the very end. I do not understand the negative reviews claiming it to be boring. My only guess is that the people who find Arrival boring would prefer a Michael Bay CGI-explosion filled Independence Day remake; this time, with TRANSFORMERS!

","Professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is one of the most brilliant linguists in the world. When aliens start appearing on the Earth in twelve random places she is tasked by the US Government to enter start communicating with them and eventually interpret their language. <br/><br/>""Arrival"" is one of the best motion pictures of recent times and continues to strike on the trend of very good and scientifically inspired sci-fi films we have had in recent times from ""Gravity"" to ""Interstellar"" and ""The Martian"". This films adds to that very good pantheon of modern Sci-Fi and it just might be one of the best we've had yet. <br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Bradford Young have been quoted saying that the look and feel they wanted to achieve for this film was a ""dirty Sci-Fi"", I think the end result is a triumph for what they set out to do, this film has a unique aesthetic to it, a brilliant one, the choices of editing and photography are incredibly coherent to the structure of the story, there is a whole visual language that is carefully crafted around the emotional and story beats of the film, it carries the audience through the picture and guides emotion masterfully and the best part is that is doesn't call attention to itself. <br/><br/>The array of perfect choices that Villeneuve made here is more and more stunning the more I think of it. The visual grammar he establishes is pure genius, the choice to shoot almost always on the ground, the eye level shot looking up to introduce set-pieces, the use of shallow focus to reflect a key element of the plot, there is a slew of stylistic choices that are carried out with pitch perfect execution by Young and combine in making an almost flawless visual piece that is as beautiful as it is emotionally charged. There is a key distinction from the start to let the audience follow and experience only one clear point of view and that makes for another incredible decision that supports the story and the character development magnificently. <br/><br/>After ""Prisoners"" and ""Sicario"" and now this we might just be experiencing the dawn of a new 'master of suspense'. That is how I would define Villenueve at the moment, his pictures are a masterclass in the building of tension and ""Arrival"" is the best example of that yet. Right from the beginning I always felt a sense of urgency to the story. With small touches and attention to details in every shot, he manages to build and build anxiety on the viewer, there is always this overlying sense of danger that manages to be established early on and never leave. Once again this all just a complex puzzle of stylistic choices in editing and photography that manages to pay off to incredible results. Every choice seems to be the right one, every shot has an aim to say something. <br/><br/>Yet, the suspense is supported by fantastic art direction, production design. From the military base camp which has a clear structure and organization to the Alien ships, everything has been thought out extensively and presented to the audience clearly. Moreover, the weight that is conveyed to the aliens and the ships is vital to the success of the film. They feel alive and present, there was never a false beat with them and their presence loomed all over the film. Sound Design and music too are brilliant, both technically faultless and artistically inspired, bringing to life the emotion of the film just as beautifully as the rest of the departments. <br/><br/>The film is also incredibly smart too, it trusts the audience and manages to open up a conversation that is as complex and multifaceted as it is fascinating and absorbing. This film stays with you, it is one of those pictures that affected me physically in the theater and after it. That is probably due to how much emotion and theme are vitally interconnected to plot and content. Every element the film needs for it to work is set-up early on, the audience is constantly entrusted with information and the film climaxes in a resolution that is as unpredictable as it is beautiful and moving and it never screams at you what is going on, thanks to a brilliant set-up you manage to think about what happens, slowly absorb it as the film is playing. <br/><br/>Amy Adams has probably had one of the best series of performances an actress could have ever asked for. After ""Nocturnal Animals"" she gives us another portrait of character that is bewildering. Her work is constantly challenging and without spoiling everything she handles the differences in her character with a cunning ability. Jeremy Renner here probably deserves the most overlook performance of the year award, he is on the same level of Adams here and plays his quirky, sympathetic character with genuine depth and gives the audience a secondary lead instead of just a throw away supporting character he might have been. <br/><br/>I think that there are a couple of faults the film has, but honestly I am still uncertain about them and have (and desperately want) to see the film a second time to see if some details passed over me. ""Arrival"" is a engrossing experience of emotion, spectacle and intelligence, a deeply moving picture that has me still thinking and one of which's images and concepts won't leave my head anytime soon."

","First I just want to point out that I'm usually not compelled to write film reviews at all - so the fact that I'm writing one now speaks for how this film moved me.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for the standard blockbuster movie lover. People who are looking for another ""Independence Day"" disaster movie, should just skip it altogether, since I can see that many negative reviews come from that type of audience. Don't get me wrong - I myself sometimes like to just be entertained - but this film demands that you ""boost your CPU"" a little bit.<br/><br/>The people who think it was boring - clearly did not understand it, either on the intellectual or the emotional level. Yes, the story has several plot holes and several unrealistic moments (hence the vote 9/10), but those do not change the essence, nor the point of this film.<br/><br/>The point of the film are not aliens per se, that is just the setting. It is a film about us and our decisions in life. About trying to perceive time and reality in a different way. We as a species are locked into a certain way of perceiving things, hence that is where our way of thinking comes from. It is a very difficult task to imagine and portray a different kind of logic and perception in a two hour movie, and I think that Denis Villeneuve does that very well.<br/><br/>There are certain aspects of the movie that may have been done a little more convincing (such as the diplomatic part, military protocol, etc.), but that does not change the fact that if you follow the story carefully and think about it - you will get some wonderful ideas out of it.<br/><br/>Anyone who likes true, smart stories - should definitely watch this in a cinema (or wait for the bluray)."

","""There are days that define your story beyond your life""<br/><br/>Holy crap. This is probably Denis's best and most emotionally powerful film. Within the first three minutes I was on the verge of tears. Every performance in this film was fantastic. The cinematography, like usual for Denis Villeneuve, is amazing and probably the best of year. The score is very unique and goes back and forth from being mysterious to somber. The visual effects, while scarce, are used effectively. And since this is a film that focuses on story more than insane effects, the fact that they are well done adds to the story. The story is unbelievably gripping, but the first half of the film contains some of the most amazing atmosphere and build up I have ever seen in any sci-fi film. Now some people have complained about the last third, but I won't get into that mostly because I feel like I need to rewatch it to fully understand what I saw. But to be honest, I had no problem with the third act.<br/><br/>But the thing that I love about this movie most is that this is a story of trying to understand what is unknown or hard to understand rather than trying to push it away or destroy it. Even with current events it came out at a perfect time. It shows that there are people who don't want to understand the unknown and that there are some who will do everything they can to understand. It shows both the care and carelessness of humanity. And it shows that life is somewhat of a gift and we shouldn't waste it trying to push away, but embrace. And that might sound really pretentious but it really struck a cord with me. I would say everyone should watch this movie, even if some parts of it I don't fully understand. But like the main character I feel compelled to return to find out more, to figure out..... Man that sounded really cheesy.<br/><br/>100/100"

"shoreup","10","2","8","2 December 2016"," Villeneuve's complex masterpiece on the essence of Humanity and Aliens
","Arrival marks a significant evolution in the treatment of Aliens in cinema, eschewing the cheap theatrics of fantasy films or easy projections of murderous intent on all extra-terrestrial life forms started by Ridley Scott's Alien trilogy. The film is based on Ted Chiang's Story of your life but Denis Villeneuve's remarkable vision has significantly enhanced the visual and narrative impact of this story. It starts with the mysterious appearance of enormous bean shaped objects in several locations on earth. Unable to get any meaningful information about the whys and hows of this event, the FBI enlists a linguist, Amy Adams to help in the translation of the cryptic sounds which these seven-footed aliens give out. The story revolves around this communication and what it reveals about humanity as a whole. <br/><br/>Apart from the stunningly melancholic look of the film, highlighting the psychologically bleak state of humanity in general, the film has a singularly haunting theme. Villeneuve is a master of the slow forward moving shot and all his films feature characters whose narrative significance is underscored by their portrayal in these perfect scenes. There are many complex themes treated here, language and conception of space-time being the most important ones. Human language is linear in time and this singular concept makes the non-linear, circular script of the aliens difficult to understand. Our use of the linear script is a reflection of our existence in a frame of time which for us only goes forward. But if this movement can happen both ways, then the language must necessarily be able to reflect that. The prime-riddle of the script Amy Adams has to unlock concerns this reversibility. The psychological impact of our limited language is also shown succinctly. Humans tend to project their desires on inanimate objects all the time. A knife can be a weapon to kill and also a weapon to cut fruits but depending on our desire for either of this, it can be good and evil at the same time. Thus when the Aliens mention weapon, humans interpret that unambiguously as an evil intent, projecting our interpretation of weapon on theirs. Such fundamentals elements of language are explored with great narrative immersion. The last and most important theme is about determinism. Modern day philosophy has over-analyzed this thing to exhaustion and one of the results of this has been the increasingly helpless situation of man to change anything for the better. Because the Aliens can get in and out of time at will, they can view the whole of future from outside of time. Amy Adams is given visions of her future which she does not comprehend at the time. Her understanding of the present comes through her intuitional immersion in her future. The film masterfully balances this manipulation of time without losing the narrative focus on the present. At the end, we are the beginning and the film has completed a circle much like the script of the aliens. The great moment of philosophical insight into determinism and free-will occurs at the end when Amy Adams is asked by her future husband if they want to have a baby. She says yes knowing fully the future of this child. Her answer gives rise to the question, What would have happened if she had said no ? Does fate only work if we give assent to it ? But whether for Amy Adams or for us, the strength to welcome fate knowing it will wrench us is truly worthy of the highest endeavors of Mankind."

I really like it how the movie used seeing the future as a mean to understand the aliens, and they used that to make a movie itself some kind of a prophecy for our own world. <br/><br/>Of course, I mean the fact that the China seems like it's the leading country in the world and America's military has experienced bankruptcy (probably it's overall economy suffered also). It is a really realistic view of our own future if you are aware of what's going on in the world and Chinas economic progress etc...

","Being a sci-fi guy who loves serious, well-conceived sci-fi (e.g. Interstellar, Battlestar Galactica (new one), Inception, The Martian, 2001, 2010, etc.) I saw this the first week out. And given the 8.5 rating and the director's previous work (Sicario, Prisoners) I fastened my seat belt for an intense ride, but alas, I almost needed a seat belt to keep from sliding out of my seat during the late evening showing. In fact, my wife did go to sleep on it. OK, so does that mean Arrival is a boring movie? For me, no, I appreciate elaborate, fairly plausible detail to create a story with authenticity that increases its impact.<br/><br/>But, given my expectations going in (Sicario was a very intense, wild ride and Prisoners was also a white-knuckler) so I was surprised at the deliberate and ponderous pacing, which mixed with the disjointed narrative, never create any real narrative momentum--even at the end when it's time for a climax/crisis. By then, we're trying to get our bearings and decide if we care enough about the story and the protagonists.<br/><br/>So, I would definitely classify this one as for sci-fi nerds only. Not bragging, but I also earned an MA in linguistics, so I was familiar with the overarching concept undergirding the story, which makes it intellectually interesting but ...

","Most of this film is good. The pacing is steady, thoughtful, and not too busy.

My objection is the beginning and the end, both of which are packed with sappy sentimentality. I simply don't care about the character's kids; parenting does not make her more interesting or heroic. The film makers might have invested in some humor for this movie; instead they went with empty sentimentality. I suggest that you arrive a bit late, and walk out right after the phone call (you will know what I mean)."
"howard.schumann","8","2","8","20 November 2016"," About the power of communication
","Denis Villeneuve's (""Sicario"") Arrival is a story about the power of communication, the illusory nature of time, and the importance of words and language in creating our conception of the world. Written by Eric Heisserer from the short story, ""Story of Your Life,"" by author Ted Chiang, it is a thinking person's science fiction film that does more than offer bad guys threatening good guys. While its aliens are no great shakes in the looks department, here they have something akin to brains and are actually trying to teach us something which, given recent historical events, might be problematic.<br/><br/>The story is one we have become familiar with in varying scenarios over the years. Space ships (in this case, 12) from another planet land in widely diverse areas on Earth and proceed to cause the world's great movers and shakers to shake a bit more than usual. Of course, the most trigger happy ones are not us but Russia and China (who else?). The key player in the scenario is Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a Professor of Linguistics. After word spreads around campus of the startling landings, Louise, who is mourning the death of her teenage daughter Hannah from cancer, is called upon by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) who asks her to use her language skills to communicate with the aliens in order to discover the reason for their visit.<br/><br/>Though the focus is on setting up contact, the film flashes backwards and forwards in time as we see her daughter Hannah as a baby being tucked into bed and her final days in the hospital. Reluctantly, Dr. Banks agrees to go to Montana where one of the giant oblong ships is hovering just off the ground. Here she is assisted by physicist Dr. Ian Connelly (Jeremie Renner) who is more interested in the scientific implications of the visit rather than what it portends for the human race. Only allowed on the space ship during strictly enforced visiting hours, Louise and her team find themselves floating through a large tunnel, finally reaching what looks like a big movie screen in which they can see and attempt to communicate with the aliens.<br/><br/>The visitors are seven-legged entities that are designated ""heptapods"" and look like they just escaped from a Walt Disney promo for a future Jurassic park movie. In a rare attempt at humor, Ian labels two of them Abbott and Costello. It is not clear who's on first but it is obvious that Bud and Lou are not fluent in English and can only communicate in a non-verbal, symbolic language drawn in pictographs. The scenes that setup the first encounter are the most affecting and the message is clear that communication between groups that lack a common frame of reference takes patience and determination.<br/><br/>The heptapods' drawings allow Louise to understand that their purpose has to do with us helping them or them helping us, whoever lasts for another three thousand years, a dubious proposition as far as Earth is concerned. Standing out as a good candidate for misinterpretation, the words ""offer weapons"" suggest something sinister to CIA agent (Michael Stuhlbarg). Of course, this throws the world into a panic and the film becomes bogged down in military maneuvers, ultimatums, and time bombs. Ultimately, however, the film focuses on what unites us rather than what divides us and Louise and Ian's personal story and their changing perspective of time adds a broader dimension.<br/><br/>Arrival contains an Oscar-caliber performance by Amy Adams whose quest for knowledge and touching personal story allows us to identify with her search for answers. While the film is unafraid to tackle big questions and contains intriguing notions about the nature of time and how it can affect our personal relationships, its atmosphere is smothered in a sort of cloudy gloom that lacks any sense of the mystery and wonder present in such earlier sci-fi films such as E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. What does stand out, however, is the realization that, as Werner Erhard expressed it, ""Every word brings with it its meaning, but meanings are not inherently there. Language gives the world its meaning. From this stand, things shift—our speaking impacts the world to match our words."" If we have any desire to create a future that nurtures us, as we enter a period of transformation, we have to create a new conversation that questions our way of being in the world, an authentic new story that is based on an abiding sense of community, an intimate connection with nature, and an unconditional love in Samuel Beckett's phrase, ""for the stars in the sky and, on earth, the brave little lights of men."""
"lewiscranstonemail","7","2","8","20 November 2016"," Thought-provoking and emotionally engaging but sometimes dull..
","Arrival is definitely a thought provoking science-fiction film to say the least. With a real, rich development of its central character, Louise Banks. Visually and sound-wise it also excels to a certain extent, from slow gliding shots through fog to beaming white brightness accompanied by an eerie score by Jóhann Jóhannsson. However the film does suffer from a little too much melodrama, as almost every scene (some fairly uplifting) has a depressing side to it. Most of the time, this is Amy Adams who gives a very good but depressing performance. Denis Villeneuve's color pallet is also quite dull. Even in some of the happier scenes, a sterile, modern light is ever present. <br/><br/>By the end of it, I was amazed but really wanted to stick on a Wes Anderson film (I'm not even a big fan)."

I was also hesitant on her casting but I would say that she was pretty close to perfect. I would say that the final scenes get a little too messy. It tries to reveal things that can already be deciphered but I feel like it panders to its audience a little too much.

Riots and political instability soon ensue, especially when the general public gets their first look at the aliens, who are Lovecraftian nightmares of tentacles, standing 50 feet tall and bellowing like whales.<br/><br/>Initial agreements for world scientists to work together soon give way to distrust as hints emerge the aliens want us to fight each other to the death, for whatever purpose (sport?) they might derive. Soon traditional cold war power blocks circle the wagons and we are approaching WWIII.<br/><br/>Flying in to the rescue in true Deus ex Machina style comes our heroine, a wildly implausible yet instantly lovable red head linguist who can predict the future. The aliens teach her how to harness and control her clairvoyance, and the day is saved.<br/><br/>Some minor quibbles. Yes this is a 'smart' sci fi movie. This is the Deep Impact version of V, rather than Apocalypse. However, the movie does not delve nearly deep enough into the subject of scientific understanding of alien communications, which they have been studying and theorizing on how to do since the 50's. Witness the Voyager and Pioneer messages, for example. Instead, dummy linguist starts the conversation with 'hello, I'm a HUMAN'. Rather dumbed down. The math wiz in the room, instead of trying PI or the atomic symbol for hydrogen, or perhaps showing a human DNA sequence, just stands there rubbing his head. This movie could have been on scientific par with CONTACT, but they went dumb, I guess to appeal to a wider audience. Another quibble is that the linguist frequently lies about world history, at one point blaming the Germans for Rwanda (it was the FRENCH....) which I'm sure the Germans are quite annoyed by. She also invents a parable to convince the General about the pitfalls of communication, when there are NUMEROUS examples from her studies she could have quoted (the discoverer of CANADA for example named the country when asking the natives 'what is this place' meaning the whole country. The natives replied, 'KANADA' which means, 'this is our village').<br/><br/>Finally, this is an intellectual time travel movie, yes, please groan away. It was interesting for sure, but really drags in points. Some limited military actions and perhaps some limited demonstrations of anger from the aliens might have been much more exciting, and still fit within the plot."

","I gotta admit...I was thinking a fancier, just as wild, Independence Day. I was wrong. I had NO idea what this movie was about before entering the theater and man, was I surprised. This is the kind of movie that each viewer has his or her own personal story within this one. Language is a great basis for this movie and although we were introduced to the language the Aliens ""spoke"", we each understand other's communications individually. Meaning what you say...may be taken differently by me than someone else. We need to listen AND understand each other. The rest? Sheesh...no way to describe. You must see this and enjoy your own result. It's that great of a movie. This is a stunning piece of work."
"christineyoon","8","2","8","13 November 2016"," Arrival: A Philosophical Take on Science-Fiction
","Admittedly, I was thoroughly confused after watching the movie, Arrival. There was a sudden plot change, a complete tangent from the story about aliens, that made me think for a period of time after the movie. The fact that I couldn't put the pieces together bothered me; I never thought so deeply after a film before. Arrival begins with the emotional thoughts of Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a presumably single mother, college professor, and linguist. When multiple mysterious spacecrafts land on several parts around the world, people go into panic and fear the advance of extraterrestrials. In the United States, Louise Banks and Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), a theoretical physicist, are recruited in order to communicate with and learn about the aliens, called Heptapods. Louise, as an expert linguist, learns the language of the Heptapods and begins to communicate with them; at the same time, she is haunted by her visions. Once Louise, as well as linguists at the other UFO locations, receive a seemingly threatening message from the Heptapods, the world falls into panic again, and countries start to arm themselves for war. On the other hand, Louise believes that there is an error in communication; it is up to her to appease the nations and save humanity.<br/><br/>Arrival has received mostly positive reviews for its touching emotion and its challenging ideas. It is different from the typical science-fiction film, as there does not seem to be a resolution; rather, it is up to the audience to determine the ending. The film gets people talking and thinking of its philosophical themes, distinguishing itself as the new movie experience. Unlike most recent films, Arrival may not be the best film for family entertainment, laughs or amusement. Rather, it will get viewers to think past typical boundaries to transcend the fourth dimension, time. As stated by the New York Times, Arrival does not have much action. Instead, it has vivid, realistic-looking computer-generated imagery (CGI) and visuals and complex concepts and ideas. Viewers will hold their breath in fear and awe as they realize the panic from the onset of the UFOs, see a different visualization of the ""alien"", and take in the hopeless future of world collaboration. The Heptapods, seven-armed aliens that look dramatically different from the typical, green Martians, have a reason for being on Earth different than the usual malicious takeover sequence of nearly all science-fiction alien movies. There is a sense of eeriness that will keep watchers on the edge of their seats, expecting the unexpected, as well as an intermittent feeling of sorrow as Louise flashes into her forlorn visions. Besides its occasional quick cuts—which do go straight to the point—and its moment of random narration, Arrival succeeds in its presentation of content. In contrast to the main characters in many other movies, the protagonists of Arrival are two ""mere"" intellectuals, a linguist and a theoretical physicist, testing the idea that ""normal people""—as opposed to superheroes, criminals, and celebrities—have the most interesting lives and abilities. In Arrival, the fate of the world laid upon these two academics, the heroes, making for an unprecedented perspective. Strengthened by the talent of Amy Adams, the character of Louise is the most important character in the film, the person who saves humanity from its destruction, the individual who wields the most extraordinary power. In addition, she is a woman, whose actions determine the fate of the world. Louise breaks through the boundaries of the female character, depicted as incredibly intelligent—whose mind not only equals that of a man's—and the foremost significant hero. The future was in her hands, and quite literally in her mind, and she was the one to lead people in the right direction. Her mind, especially, worked unlike any others', demonstrating that a woman can have an impressive, powerful mind too.<br/><br/>Arrival may baffle the moviegoer, but it will astonish with its striking graphics and abstract, introspective concepts. It will expand the mind, scientifically and even socially, promising an exceptional movie experience."
"alexlee-84209","9","2","8","13 November 2016"," One of the best science fiction films ever made...
","Arrival is a fantastic science fiction drama which I extremely enjoyed. You would think that when a large grey alien space ship shaped like a coco bean lands on Earth for no apparent reason, it would bring chaos, death and potentially the end of the world. However, Arrival is the complete opposite, yet it still kept me very engaged throughout and is certainly one of the best films I have ever seen and possibly the best science fiction film I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Don't expect from this film huge space ship battles and action throughout. Its got none of that, which I think is brilliant because it shows you can make a very entertaining alien film without any action. The deeper more complex back story to do with Dr Banks (Amy Adams), which I will let you find out, really adds another layer to this film and wraps it up very nicely at the end. It gets quite emotional as we go deeper into Dr Banks life and see the struggles she has had to face: a divorce and the death of her daughter. This film really displays how the human race is very much divided, and really tests the teamwork and trust of all the nations involved. Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are all fantastic and suite their roles perfectly. There is some stunning cinematography: including the shot which shows the ""Heptapod"" towering over the US army camp. <br/><br/>Overall this is truly an amazing film, which you must watch. It is a film which deserves to win some Oscars: prehaps special effects and cinematography. 9/10"
"sol-","Null","2","8","12 November 2016"," Close Encounters
","Haunted by memories of a deceased teenage daughter, a lonely linguist agrees to assist in communicating with an extraterrestrial species in this first contact sci-fi outing from Denis Villeneuve. The film looks, sounds and feels like Villeneuve's earlier 'Sicario' with aerial shots that bask in lush landscapes, another perfectly brooding Jóhann Jóhannsson music score and yet another plot about a young woman out of her depth. The action content here is negligible though, which renders 'Arrival' refreshingly different from most other first contact movies as the film focuses on credible barriers with alien communication. The big question is whether the aliens are hostile or peaceful since it is impossible to understand them. The communication theme is not limited to the aliens though; with spaceships landing in twelve places around the world, issues arise from various countries being unwilling to share information. Much like 'Under the Skin', the film also highlights humankind's tendency to always react violently to what we do not understand, but there is actually a positive tone overall. The film has some pacing issues though. The conclusion is overly drawn out (with at least a couple of false endings) and the final few scenes only serve to blatantly spell out plot twists and turns that did not need to be explicitly stated. The scenes of various young military personnel having their doubts also distract from the protagonist's journey. Whatever the case, Amy Adams is solid in the lead role. Villeneuve lets his camera focus on her trembling hands as well as her face, allowing her to give a true full body performance. Strong support also comes from Forest Whitaker and Jeremy Renner even if it sometimes feels like they could have been given more to do."

","The movie is good - and perhaps better than good. If you like sci-fi it's a must-see movie. However, it is not great – and it is really trying way too hard to compete with movies like 2001 Space odyssey and Interstellar. <br/><br/>The movie cannot decide whether the main object is the alien or the human. The humans are boring and I really just wanted to know more about the aliens. The movie is trying to give us insight into the ""main character"" life story – but it's difficult to care. <br/><br/>Of course, this movie is more about humans and human behavior and communication – and the aliens work as a metaphor. The main problem is that the metaphor has a personality, while the ""main characters"" has none. <br/><br/>The visuals and music is Excellent. The movie would have worked very well as a music video. <br/><br/>Due to very boring main characters the movie is not even close to 8 stars. However, there are several elements of greatness in this movie. 6 stars."
"mannacio","8","2","8","12 November 2016"," Alien Encounter as a Device
","This is an exceptional movie, better than its nearest equivalent: ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". What makes it better is, in part, that the Aliens and their Arrival are largely a device. This device explores several issues. One is how our species reacts to a perceived threat. Another is how language may shape our thoughts. The third is our notion of time. Each one could merit a philosophical paper of its own so it would be far too much to expect of this tale to resolve all of these issues. Yet in its somewhat touchy-freely way it succeeds well enough because it make us think about these issues. Some of us anyway since overheard conversation leaving the theater suggested to me that some people really didn't get it. The rating I have given could, despite how good the movie is, still be a bit high in light of the rating some of the best 100 movies of all time were given. But as a recent film compared to recent films it seems about right."

They kinda rushed through so many details leaving one to assume much. On the other hand, movie was dead slow in places taking way to long to make a point. I did find her interactions with the creatures eerie and intense, especially at the beginning, before the nonsense began. Trying to figure out their language and communicate with them was intriguing. There is the back story of her daughter from birth until her untimely death (or did she?), which leads to some kind of idea-- mentioned in only one sentence, might I add- about ""Time being not linear"", flash backs, or maybe flash-forwards -to incidences involving the Chinese general, Kids drawings, clay figures and Jeremy Renner was always there as the father of her kid???? What?? I was lost! And then POOF, the pods dematerialize and disappear. The point was totally lost on me. I found the sub-title words of what the aliens were saying to her hokey and out of place. After the first hour it's like the director said ""OK Lets wrap this up quick, we're out of time to schedule in any sense of it all. Which was a real shame. For clarity, we are huge Alien/Sci-fi/UFO fans and rarely miss a show or movie in this genre."
"socrates99","8","2","8","11 November 2016"," Underwhelming, but thought provoking and well acted
","This movie attempts to depict what a real first contact might look like. For SciFi fans, that's practically the Holy Grail. Unfortunately, it's also extremely difficult to pull off, especially for those of us who love the genre. (I've been trying to outdo Hollywood with my own musings for years and seldom manage to do better.)<br/><br/>There are several new ideas incorporated in this latest visionary story, and though I found them a bit adolescent, I am happy that regular people are realizing that our being contacted by an intelligent and necessarily more advanced species is going to be far more impactful for us than, say, the cure for cancer or the creation of machine super-intelligence.<br/><br/>The long and the short of it is, this movie asks you to overlook a simple point about the whole predicament as it's presented. And I can't say that stopped me from enjoying the ride, but it did disappoint a bit. The people I was with thought the movie well above average and they enjoyed it more than I did, but they weren't SciFi aficionados, like me, so the bar was a lot lower for them."

Without revealing spoilers, let's just say this isn't your cookie cutter Marvel Cinematic Universe film, and while it appears to be another ""alien invasion"" movie, there really is no movie like this one ever.<br/><br/>This movie knocks it out of the park as far as storytelling, soundtrack, acting, special effects, and an ending twist that just leaves you shocked, confused, amazed, stunned, or all of the above.<br/><br/>Amy Adams should get nominated for something and the movie script needs to be winning several awards this year.<br/><br/>I will say that you need to pay attention during the entire movie and have an open mind in trying to understand what is taking place.

"urthpainter","8","2","8","11 November 2016"," A High Ceiling
","As a fan of science fiction, there are occasional movies I absolutely must see in the theater. I would include Arrival on this list, and really had high anticipation for this viewing.<br/><br/>Arrival does not disappoint those looking for quality film making, and a story well told. But I left not being amazed by a science fiction movie, but seeing another fine example of Denis Villeneuve's film making. He has a unique skill of handling the specific details of one or two characters, while placing them in a chaotic/dangerous environment. Prisoners, Incendes, Enemy, Sicario - You really get to know the main characters in his films though their stress and hardship - that are a function of the environment, and story being told.<br/><br/>Once again Villeneuve nails a consistent visual look, that somehow works from exteriors, interiors, close, long, and even shots with special effects. I'm sure like Nolan, his films have color schemes and strict design to maintain visual consistency. I didn't feel like the environment was a character like in Sicario, but Arrival is beautiful none the less - especially in the atmospheric vistas which include the alien craft.<br/><br/>The visuals and unique content are matched by a jarring, yet somehow completely fitting and even beautiful(?) music score. Might be one of the best parts of this movie and it is clear Jóhann Jóhannsson and Villeneuve have a solid working relationship.<br/><br/>I read a ton of science fiction, and rarely do movies even come close to the concepts and ideas presented by the best authors of this genre. Arrival comes close. Like Nolan's Interstellar, Arrival presents challenging ideas through clever editing, sound design, and visual presentation. But there is nothing like Interstellar's tesseract sequence. Everything is done with traditional film techniques. Yes there are special effects for obvious elements regarding the aliens and their craft, but the vast majority of deep ideas are not attached to visual effects. Not only that, but not all the answers are spoon fed - the viewer has to bring a bit of intelligence to the experience for understanding. This is comprehensive too. What does the title mean? Why are certain camera shots repeated? What exactly is happening with the main character?<br/><br/>These questions are answered over the films two hours.<br/><br/>Critiques. Recreating TV news broadcasts must be difficult in film, because rarely is it done well. The background sets never look quite right, the actors don't behave like news anchors and when they use real people to play themselves? Almost the worst stylistic choice, because it always feels contrived. Arrival uses a lot of created media footage to help set the world stage of an international event. It's acceptable in terms of presentation, and works - but its not great. Speaking more generally, this lack of polish could also be the result of this film being a bit rushed. I noticed the same thing with directors Blomkamp's films. District 9 is stunning, but each successive film he has made seems less complete and polished due to scheduling and less of the ability to make each film a labor of love. Hopefully this won't become a trend with Villeneuve's films.<br/><br/>Worth mentioning: This movie is not Interstellar. Arrival doesn't have the mega budget, or explosive entertainment. The Arrival has a slow pace, heartfelt emotion regarding difficult parts of the human condition, and a complex conclusion that requires some thinking. A group of people walked out of the showing I wend to... five minutes before the film ended, and really I can't blame them. If they were looking for pure entertainment, action or a hyped science fiction film? Probably not the movie they were hoping to see.<br/><br/>But me? I'm a huge fan of this director and I fully enjoyed this movies theater experience. It pleases me to see him working in this genre, and I'm excited for his future work.<br/><br/>Expectations met 8-10"
"ccorral419","8","2","8","8 November 2016"," A fresh look at a genre we know well
","Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario - 2015) provides a new look at the ""alien"" film, giving both a new space craft to marvel and explore, new alien sounds, and a different kind of creature to interact with. For these reasons alone, the film is a success. However, with a complicated screenplay by Eric Heisserer (based on a short story by Ted Chiang), it is the backstory that continually gets in the way of an otherwise intriguing viewing experience. Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker) calls in linguist Amy Adams (exceptionally terrific here) and Scientist Jeremy Renner (playing second fiddle to Adams) to decode the alien chat. All is well and exciting until Adams starts having flashbacks/forwards (I couldn't tell) that somehow relate to the story and hold the secret to the world not falling into despair. When the film ended, I couldn't help but wonder ""what happen""? Music is at times predictable Sci-Fi (Jóhann Jóhannsson), yet it is equally calming and helps move the mystery of the experience along nicely. Cinematography, especially inside the spacecraft, is terrific by Bradford Young. You'll probably read that ""Arrival"" is the ""Close Encounters"" of our day and/or that the film is Stanley Kubrick oriented. Well I say, it's just another alien film that manages to provide a fresh look at a genre we know well."
"Lewis_Heather787","9","2","8","7 November 2016"," A new type of sci-fi film!
","Arrival is a new type of science fiction film that has many qualities that aren't normally associated with this genre, very refreshing. First lets start by saying this film makes you think and is in no way traditional sci-fi film with an over use in CGI or action, no this film is slow,thoughtful,emotional and thrilling. So prepared for a new experience on the genre.<br/><br/>Now the positives of the film, firstly the director Denis Villeneuve who once again showed his talent on the big screen. The camera work in this film is interesting and intriguing at times, it also sets the tone of the film a little. Right from the get go there are long panning shot from the ceiling to the floor, the slow pace shows a journey and that's what this film is. Also the shots in this film work extremely well with the blend of CGI and real life backgrounds, makes the experience seem much more realistic and his helped by good CGI and production design.<br/><br/>Next the cinematography by Bradford Young, which is out of this world....(pun intended). This has to be some of the best cinematography in a film I've ever since, there is never a moment when the picture on the screen doesn't look amazing. There is a dark and warmthness to the look of the film that draws you more in but does still leave you unnerved. <br/><br/>Another positive are the performances which from the three main leads is very solid, that is all they needed to be. Amy Adams once again brings an innocent and likable character to life and someone who you gravitate towards and care for through the journey of this film.Jeremy Renner is also good in the film, being sort of like the audience through the film wanting to help Amy Adams character. Finally Forest Whitaker who is a very bankable actor, showing a tough man who just wants to do the right thing. <br/><br/>The next positive is the story which is interesting and methodical, weaving through the initial contact from the shell and the emotional background to Amy Adams character. Its new,different,re-freshing and the best part about it is the pacing which is very solid throughout and never seems overly slow or fast.<br/><br/>The final positive of the film is the score which reminds me of another science fiction film for its impact in the film. Interstellar's score had a huge impact on the films scenes and situations and I feel that the score in this film has the same effect. Building tension in a long panning shot and then dissipating, making the audience believe something will happen only then not to, an excellent example of a tension builder. It can also be calm and soothing at times which really complements the brash/harshness or the tension. Moments when a more human story is being shown/portrayed on screen like Amy Adams character for example, perfectly has this score dropped into it at her more private moments.<br/><br/>There is only one negative with this film, re-watchability. This film could be tricky to watch again after knowing the twist/pay off, however hopefully the amount of good in this film should be able to carry you through this new sci-fi drama experience. This film has a 9/10 rating or 92% it could be pushing more towards 95% out of 100, this film is a breathe of fresh air for the science fiction genre. A very good film overall, plus its an original film!!"

Amy Adams gives an emotionally brilliant performance. Through a well- written story that captures your imagination, ARRIVAL is both breathtaking and profound.<br/><br/>What I love about ARRIVAL among many reasons, is that yes, this movie has big visual effects and set pieces, but I think this is the one sci-fi movie where yes the concept is intriguing, it has both your curiosity and attention, but the meaning behind it and the themes are way more affecting. It's an extremely thought- provoking film that you and your friends would discuss for days after you've screened it. And the visuals do just about enough to wow you, the approach is so delicate, so precise as to elevate the emotional journey of Amy Adams' character.<br/><br/>A bold script, and an even bolder directing, with Johann Johannsson's celestial music and Bradford Young's beautiful cinematography, much of ARRIVAL also kinda looks and feels like if Terrence Malick made an alien invasion drama. One of the greatest actresses in the history of cinema, Amy Adams, proves once again that she can carry a movie with such magnitude, she's like a battleship that shoots torpedo at enemies in its path and she nails every last one of them. It feels like a privilege watching Amy do her thing in ARRIVAL because you're witnessing perfection at work. The film deals with two big themes, the importance of communication and understanding AND the idea of embracing the inevitable given the opportunity to change it, I love stories like this that end up making you reflect on your life's decisions.

","It would be unfair to neatly divide sci-fi cinema into mindless action flicks and intellectual futurist dramas - many movies have elements of both - but if you did make that division, Arrival would be very far into the latter category. This is, after all, a movie about a linguist learning to communicate with aliens, and if that sounds boring to you then you probably will be bored by this movie, because that's very much what you get. <br/><br/>But as I say, sci-fi doesn't categorize that neatly, so you also get some suspense and a good deal of deep emotional content.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was terrific. It is a movie that tries to create aliens who communicate in a unique, powerful way. I felt it did a pretty decent job of showing the challenges and possible ways to approach learning to communicate with an alien species (although the film acts as though linguists don't already have set protocols to learn new languages, which annoyed me). <br/><br/>I can understand people not liking this, because it is pretty slow moving. On the other hand, the one-star user reviews here usually raised all sorts of dumb objections that suggest they just didn't understand the movie. I'm not saying that there aren't legitimate reasons for an intelligent, thoughtful person to dislike this movie, I'm just saying that there are a lot of hostile reviews here by half-wits. So you should ignore those.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is excellent, the special effects are well done, the way the arrival effects the world is persuasive, and the movie is clear without spoonfeeding the audience.

The problem, however, is that it is a bit of a slippery slope. If done masterfully (usually from a superb director and featuring top-notch acting), you have an all-time classic. If all the concepts aren't grasped, though, you have a muddled mess that doesn't succeed at much while failing at a lot. Fortunately, ""Arrival"" is a prime example of the former, as director Dennis Villeneuve vaults himself into the ranks of Nolan, Eastwood, Spielberg, etc. with this effort.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary (no major spoilers), ""Arrival"" is the story of Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), who is recruited to a site (one of 12) of an alien ""first contact"" of sorts featuring odd cylindrical objects. Louise is an expert linguist, and the government hopes she can break the ice and decode the alien symbology. Paired with scientist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), the pair get to work decoding both the language and the science of this new species. Along the way, they discover that the aliens may be trying to do more than just communicate.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" is one of the best films I have ever seen...bar none! It combines incredible acting, compelling visuals, and a plot that will stimulate you mentally all the way through. I liken it to a mix of two Nolan films (Interstellar & The Prestige) and Villeneuve's previous work ""Enemy"". There is not one boring scene in the film and each scene builds into the next towards a conclusion that will leave you quite speechless with wonder.<br/><br/>I could write for paragraph after paragraph about the intricacies of ""Arrival"", but I won't because it is also one of those films where you DO NOT want to be spoiled going in. I won't go so far as to call it a ""twist ending"" movie, but just the entire concept of the piece is best enjoyed with an open mind.<br/><br/>I really hope that ""Arrival"" garners either its own award nominations, or at the very least for Villeneuve, as it truly deserves them. Yes, technically it falls under the ""science fiction"" genre (that usually gets shut out come award season), but this movie is oh so much more! It can be enjoyed by everyone and easily crosses all genre/appeal lines. I may have just seen the movie of the year!"
"joshteggert","10","2","9","15 February 2017"," Amy Adams provides a stand out performance in this enthralling, grounded sci-fi thriller
","A beautifully balanced story and a compelling cast, 'Arrival' is a modern sci-fi triumph. It is particularly refreshing in the stance that it is not heavily dependent on special effects or futuristic, bombastic violence, nor too complicated in its thematic approach. Moreover, one may say it is ""down to Earth"", and consistently thrilling, packed with twists and shocks that are not only exhilarating, but also plausible.<br/><br/>Amy Adams' character, Dr Louise Banks, is central to the plot, following her inner struggle with an unfamiliar life which she keeps seeing in her mind, and her linguistic talents enlisted by the military after 12 extra-terrestrial spacecraft arrive unexpectedly in different locations across the planet, with her job being to decipher the alien language. The events unfold delightfully, weaving the sci-fi aspect in with the realism seamlessly using flashbacks and visions to deepen the impact of the burden that Banks is undertaking. The distinction between the present and the visions is presented terrifically, subtly hinting at the eventual reveal that ties the whole narrative together, which in itself is magnificent and sincerely awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuve could not have picked a better leading female than Amy Adams, who appropriates the clash between her duties and personal issues with assured naturalism. The audience is very much endorsed in Bank's story, to the point where the aliens themselves are never shown in their full profile until she herself sees them. Most importantly, the film focuses much more on her than it does on the extra-terrestrials, and Adams embraces this wonderfully with her remarkable acting, demonstrating an exterior calmness juxtaposed by a tormented and scarred interior. But as a result of this personal connection, Villeneuve has exceeded expectations in terms of dramatic effect, producing a film that is strangely more relatable than most sci-fi films previously.<br/><br/>In addition, the science behind the story is intelligently constructed, leaving few questions out in the open that cannot feasibly be resolved by the explanations given. 'Arrival' is continuously complex yet coherent, primarily due to the strong storytelling provoked by Villeneuve's expressive and mysterious style, seen as well in his former works 'Sicario' and 'Prisoners', which in combination with Eric Heisserer's fluent screenplay (adapted from Ted Chiang's short story 'Story of Your Life') successfully forms an atmospheric and efficacious cinematic experience, making the film believable over anything else, an aspect that the likes of 'Interstellar' ultimately couldn't master.<br/><br/>However, most vitally, 'Arrival' doesn't just deal with the influence of aliens on the world, but rather the impact of humanity. It's this precise balance that makes 'Arrival' an absolutely exceptional display; another fascinating film by Villeneuve and one of the greatest sci-fi films of the modern era."
"peterp-450-298716","7","2","9","4 February 2017"," Lets communicate E.T.
","""Remember what happened to the aborigines. A more advanced race nearly wiped them out.""<br/><br/>Science fiction is a genre that leaves room for ideological visions and fictional future scenarios. A technological fantasy story, as it were. In ""Arrival"" this is more applicable on a human level. In this case it's the effort of humanity to communicate with an alien civilization. That's fiction enough already. We're not even capable of communicating with each other as humans in a decent manner. Let alone with an alien race that speaks with the use of primal sounds. It's like having a conversation with a group of surreal musicians who produce ingenious sound effects with polyphonic synthesizers. ""Arrival"" isn't overloaded with graphical masterpieces what an average person would expect to see in a SF. No huge spaceships propelling through galaxies. There are no enormous space wars taking place with massive laser battles. No, just 12 black spacecraft, looking like huge black cashew nuts, floating seemingly motionless a few meters above the earth's surface, spread all over our globe. <br/><br/>The central theme is the almost impossible task to establish a communication between humans and aliens. This mission is being led by the linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) together with the mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). For them it's a real challenge to fathom the semantics used by these aliens and to interpret the sprayed circles (with extraterrestrial ink), produced by the tentacles of the octopus-like aliens. And next to that, her work is also hampered by recurring memories of her deceased daughter.<br/><br/>You could conclude very quickly that this would constitute a slow and über-serious science fiction. A film to which literary scholars would respond rather enthusiastically. But believe me, ""Arrival"" is so ingeniously constructed and compelling that your attention won't slack for a moment. Even if a Masai warrior would perform a ""jumping dance"" next to your couch. First there's the melodramatic beginning with a brief, modest overview of Louise's life and where fate hits merciless hard. Then we move on to the section where the visitors are introduced and Louise's help is asked so she would give these, as immigrants considered newcomers, an integration course. The fact that only the US apparently are open to a dialogue while other countries, such as China and Russia, would rather shoot these coffee beans to smithereens, is in my opinion a romanticizing of our current global situation.<br/><br/>The emphasis is on the educational aspect with Louise and Donnelly working against the clock and trying to start a dialogue. Meanwhile we see flashbacks about Louise's daughter. A major event that runs like a thread through the film. However, when the disclosure becomes clear, the message behind the whole turns out to be much larger than the seemingly simplistic story-line. When the true reason for the alien is revealed and the implications get clearer, the film takes on a whole different meaning. ""Arrival"" is a SF with a philosophical slant that'll give you food for thought. Ultimately communicating is the central message in itself. And this on all areas. Hats off to those aliens. They made this miserable long trip just to point this out to us humans. Way to go.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" isn't an action packed Sci-fi full of impressive CGI. But on the other hand, the shown images are incredibly beautiful. The concise fictional elements look minimalistic and at the same time amazing. Such as the entering of the spacecraft with it's tilting, confusing gravity. The mood of this film is immersive. And this also thanks to the supporting soundtrack. Add to that the rather superb performances and a thoughtful script, and you'll get a great movie. ""Arrival"" is not an exceptional SF, but still manages to impress thanks to a masterful concept. Villeneuve-worthy in other words.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

","This movie actually requires you to pay attention so for all those expecting action, warfare and a G. I. Joe type scenario, watch it again from a different perspective. <br/><br/>Arrival had 2 important messages for me and I hope others see the same after viewing it.<br/><br/>1. Mankind is too quick to declare war on anything they feel threatens them WITHOUT making the effort to fully understand the situation. <br/><br/>Look at our current leaders of the first world nations - the USA, China, Russia, the UK...all of them are full of s*#t, threatening and bullying those they deem lesser than themselves. There has never been a more USELESS organization than the United Nations (Palestine, Syria, Rwanda..the list goes on where these countries are at the mercy of the these so-called world leaders who couldn't give a flying f&#k!) which basically looks and acts like a front that has no substance and takes their orders from the very sources committing these atrocities. <br/><br/>2. While we don't officially have the tech to fly through time in either direction (by the time you read this review, opinion may have revised), the second theme is just as important as the first: learn from the past to prevent errors from happening in the present in order to protect our collective future!<br/><br/>We don't have an infinite amount of time so we need to act, however this doesn't mean be an a$$hole and pillage/steal/threaten/destroy in order to come out top dog / ahead of the competition. If everyone works towards bettering themselves, alone, instead of uniting to better humanity, 99% of the world and her beauty is lost to us. <br/><br/>Let's open our minds and hearts, understand both sides and try to make a better world for everyone."
"renanjark","9","2","9","30 January 2017"," A movie about communication (and how the lack of it causes us problems)
","A movie about communication (and how the lack of it causes us problems). A movie about how we interpret the other (the foreigner, the unknown, the visitor) based on our own language. Obviously this is how we establish contact, how we socialize. Languages offer us a way to make ourselves understood. The problem is that there is much more than we can express with our language systems. Moreover, when we try to understand the unknown through our language, we run the risk of misinterpreting the other.<br/><br/>'Arrival' offers a reflection on the importance of immersing ourselves in the culture of the other when we want to understand it. It also allows us to question how our ability to think is limited by our language, our vocabulary, our communication tools. In addition, it brings the reflection about how today, more than ever, dialogues are extremely fundamental. A dialogue, when effective, allows us, in addition to getting out of our arrogant and strongly cemented ignorance, to reconcile the differences that characterize us as humans.<br/><br/>Although I thought the movie was amazing and beautifully conceived, (and here I put a SPOILER ALERT) I disliked the way it painted China (and Russia to some extent) as a naive and inconsequential governance, performing acts that need to be corrected by the US. Beyond the philosophical conclusions of the film, the political outcome would be that the US would remain better prepared keep its leadership. Paradoxically, I thought that, given the character of the language that demanded translation, the Chinese would be far more successful in deciphering it than the Americans. Chinese ideograms and the way they embody concepts in their symbols are much closer to the language of visitors than our Western system. But finally, I'll leave such technical analyzes to those who really understand the subject."

","I chose to watch this movie because of the review rating (8.2/10) and the actors. I'm so glad I did! This movie is slow but slow in a way that is thought provoking. I can understand how there are some reviews about it being boring, but really it's not. It was refreshing to not see a cheesy alien movie...which I was expecting. There is no unnecessary fighting, over the top special effects, or sex. I suggest watching this movie if you enjoy a story that takes time but always keeps you thinking of what's to come. There are so many things to reflect on in this movie. Plus, the actors were great! I'm very impressed with the variety of roles Amy can play.

","Arrival wasn't what I was expecting and I understand how some people are rating it as a dud, but even though it played at quite a slow pace it was still engaging throughout and reminded me of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other similar films.<br/><br/>The aliens invading earth scenario was a side-show to the past/future/present life of the lead character played by Amy Adams, which was a cheap trick actually to make a sedate film seem more interesting, and only really served to give the film more punch than similarly fantastical moral-dilemma films like Tree of Life or The Fountain, which failed even more than Arrival did. Arrival was much better than those, but not a sci-fi film in the traditional sense of the word.<br/><br/>Arrival is, however, a film you can watch a second or third time from an entirely different perspective because of what you didn't know at the beginning or during the film itself, and with retrospect it enables you to appreciate the acting and aspects of the film you'd overlooked before.<br/><br/>Even with retrospect, Arrival isn't a fantastic film because there isn't enough going on and there are too many repeat build-up scenes which makes it plod, but it's still a good watch for the patient viewer who likes to think about their material after the final curtain closes.<br/><br/>The haters are out in force though so this review is going to get '0 out of 10 people found this useful', I suspect. Then again, I think Solaris is a wonderful film, so what do I know?"

Oh, yes, the gazillion Sci-fi films before this one.<br/><br/>Oh yes and Adams can also break through time, saving the world from another major world war by whispering in some Chinese diplomats ear.<br/><br/>Well we already know time is non-linear so no big revelation there and the idea that Adams (who plays a professor in the film) has all this high level top secret military clearance is a stretch.<br/><br/>It's not a horrible film yet it's not a great film.

Indeed it. I have to realize that the film is well directed. The soundtrack is perfect, almost alienating ?! The flaw script sometimes, but it does not disturb. And Amy Adams fit, beautiful and enthralling (and this comes from someone who has never convinced on). I'm not going to dwell much on the plot: the aliens arrive and we try to communicate with them. It 'a simple idea, but I bet that the film failed because the original idea is so trivial to us a b-movie; No. Succeeded because it involves the viewer, drags him into a story in time and space, the humanity island, upsets him trying to approach a philosophical inquiry to the dimension of language, attracts the mystery, fills him full circle of the film as if writing they were the same eptapodi."

I suppose that this in some way sums up US foreign policy but hang on, we have the worlds leading linguist on hand, she will crack this.<br/><br/>So, having explained the enormous difficulty of translating an unknown language without any clues, rather than going right back to basics to establish a foundation, say with numbers, she dives straight in with a hand written sign saying 'HUMAN'.<br/><br/>There were unexplained leaps all over the place and the audience was left to assume that the linguist was so clever that she cracked the code in the blink of an eye as they were trying to count the alien's tentacles.<br/><br/>I used to be a bit of a sci-fi fan but CGI ruined it for me, it has to make sense - even if it is only theoretical or fantasy sense - this film lacked logic and cohesion. The canary (if that's what it was) was corny and the romantic angle was as pointless as the physics professor's presence throughout the film.<br/><br/>It probably says a great deal about how films get made these days, try to accommodate as many interests as possible, bit of action, bit of sci-fi, bit of romance etc. and the result is something that's a bit of rubbish.<br/><br/>I rarely leave a cinema before the last of the credits but my companions were on their feet as soon as they started to roll so I never got to see if Noam Chomsky had been a consultant. ;-)"

These characters are never developed. I know nothing about their personal goals or desires, and they don't change at all, they have no arc.

As usual Hollywood ran with the same old formula that 99% of these type of films always do. Politicians play their games, Scientists want to investigate but the Military wants to blow things up.

"angus-silvie","1","1","3","12 September 2019"," Could have been so much better
","This film had a good underlying idea but the execution was just frustrating. Here are just a few of them:<br/><br/>1. The cameraman seemed to have left a blue-grey muslin cloth over the lens for the entire film. It was dark, muted, miserable, grey. Made you fed up before you had even seen 5 mins of it. The sun never shone. It was depressing and annoying.
2. What's with the heavy breathing, Amy? No-one else wearing a space suit had the need to inhale/exhale loudly the whole time as though they have just run 400m, but directors seems to think that this raises tension or shows that the character is at the limits of their endurance but for goodness sake, all she is doing is walking!
3. Other reviewers have mentioned many of the plot holes so I won't repeat them. But that whole bit about disconnecting from the other 11 sites with the screens all going down together was just daft, as was the aliens being so advanced yet unable to communcate the message they had come with (had they not thought of this before they came?) unless, by chance, a linguistic lady was able to, by some miracle never explained, interpret their circular smoke squiggles?
4. Mumbling. A perennial issue with American films. Forest Whittaker spots Jeremy Renner. ""Fergh ish blufl?"" he asks. ""Chauff"" replies Jeremy. ""Beturf eh wogue"" says Forest before ambling off. Huh? What did you guys just say? Rewinding and playing it back often doesn't help. Because they mumbled!! They seem to forget that there might be an audience straining to hear what they are saying. Annoying.
5. Acting. Amy Adams spent much of her time staring suddenly at the ground and making 'I've just thought of something ground-breaking' faces, before resuming whatever she was doing and revealing nothing. Jeremy Renner was hardly in it. Forest Whittaker just acted the tough guy, mumbled and bumbled around the place barking silly orders, and always looked as though he was really fed up and couldn't wait to get out of there. Perhaps because it was so dim and grey, who could blame him.<br/><br/>There was a good film in there struggling to get out, but it didn't."

","Denis Villeneuve has proven himself as one of the great modern directors after movies like ""Prisoners"" along with this movie and others of his that I'm just flat out dying to see like ""Sicario"" and ""Blade Runner: 2049"" and on top of that this movie is one of 2016's very best. This is no ordinary movie about aliens where we learn to love them and want to be their friends such as in Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."" have shown us or a movie that makes us want to be scared to death of them like ""Alien"" or ""Aliens"" , but it is a movie that makes us uncertain and curious as to what they want to do to us and why they're here on Earth in the first place. The movie stars Amy Adams in a top notch performance that was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar nomination as Louise Banks a linguistics professor who along with the rest of the world learns that 12 mysterious alien ships have touched down on 12 different locations around the globe and is recruited by an Army Colonel (Forest Whitaker) to find out what their purpose is on this planet mainly because she has a top secret security clearance. She then is taken into a helicopter to go to the site where they will find the alien ship and on her team is a man named Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) who she develops a close relationship with on the mission. During the first scenes in the movie while I was waiting for the aliens to appear I felt the same feeling I had waiting for the shark in ""Jaws"" but only this movie isn't as suspenseful. Villeneuve is a director who really knows what he is doing behind the camera and really knows how to get strong performances from his actors whether it's Hugh Jackman in ""Prisoners"" or Amy Adams in this movie. The movie is one of the very best science fiction movies I have ever seen along with ""Inception"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""ET"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""the ""Star Wars"" films and more. This is a movie that will stand the test of time over the next several decades and is truly a masterpiece."

"jornthomasdufey","10","1","3","2 October 2018"," The most authentic ""What if aliens actually visited"" movie I've ever seen
","I've seen this movie many times, twice on cinema, because I had to bring my son to see it, it made such an impact on me.
What this movie does, which makes the whole movie so much more authentic, is that everything that happens in the world, you view through the eyes of the main character. There are no ""meanwhile, in the White House"" scenes, or ""meanwhile, in France"". The few scenes you get from other parts of the World are either through news on the radio, or on TV. This makes the movie all the more claustrophobic and realistic. <br/><br/>This is what would probably happen if Aliens visited, and why I love this movie so much. It keeps the suspense up to the very end, keeping you on edge while the nations of the World tries to figure out, in their own way, what the hell is going on. Why are these alien aricrafts here and what do they want. <br/><br/>Do they want war? Share knowledge? Our resources? <br/><br/>Also, don't get me started on the scenery. If you've seen Prisoners, Sicario or Blade Runner 2049, you know what to expect: Huge, magnificient scenes with music that demands your attention. There are some scenes here that still gives me the chills when I see them. <br/><br/>The music depicts what these people must be feeling perfectly: alarming, menacing and alien. <br/><br/>This movie also has a twist of sorts that makes it worth while to watch a second time, just to clear up any lose ends. Small scenes that makes more sense after you know what's actually going on: what's with the messy timeline? It all makes sense in the end. <br/><br/>Well worth a watch."

So you'll learn a language in a few weeks (or months?) by scribbling abstract words on a white board? You're not even going to start by pointing at reference objects? And mysteriously, you become fluent in no time to the point where you master supra-temporal perception based on language?<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm just old-fashioned a la Shakespeare's ""A rose is a rose by any other name,"" and unconvinced that learning a weird new circular language will suddenly make you clairvoyant?

By the time certain third-act revelations roll around, each one making you salivate at the thought of a second viewing (which holds up and is a very different experience, I might add), you will have been taken on a personal journey far more impactful than you could've imagined, helped enormously by the flick's phenomenal musical score and unique editing structure, and you'll realise that the story itself was never really about the aliens at all.

It concentrates entirely on the first interactions between humanity and the aliens, without departing into a CGI battle, but it is by no means boring. There is always a fascinating tension in the room (well, tent) and you want to know all the time why the aliens are on Earth and what they want to tell the people.

","Arrival remains my favorite movie of 2016 and is probably my second all time favorite after Contact. It's a perfect movie packed with a thirst for answers; an adventure that keeps asking what's next, although giving you clues in front of your eyes right from the beginning. The emotional weight it carries is conveyed masterfully by the lead actress, using mostly just her body language, all orchestrated by the brilliant director Denis Villeneuve in conjunction with an outstanding soundtrack and a sombre but eye striking cinematography. Athough the core of the movie is finding means of communication with an alien civilization, the whole picture asks a more important question: ""If you saw your life from start to finish, would you change anything?""."

"TheOny13","10","1","3","6 February 2018"," When Independence Day meets Interstellar! (no spoilers)
","I watched this movie because it was in my 2017 oscar highlights list and I gave it a try to see how it is. Arrival is directed by Denise Villeneuve who also directed Blade Runner 2049 (which I didn't like at all) and tells the story of a linguistic teacher who is hired by the military to try to communicate with the arrived aliens.<br/><br/>Honestly I was skeptical about this movie having watched Blade Runner 2049 some months ago and at the same time I was realistic and opened for this movie to maybe blow me away. I was constantly intrigued and amazed by this movie. This movie for me is without a doubt the best movie of 2016 along with Hacksaw Ridge. Is a very thoughtful movie with a very deep message that at the same time manages to surprise the viewer in ways that you couldn't even imagine. At the beginning I was intrigued by the concept of aliens arriving on earth and how would it be to try to communicate with them but the movie really took me in directions I didn't expect and rewarded my patience throughout the runtime. Let's start with Amy Adams' performance which was mesmerizing and one of her best in recent movies. She was calm relaxed and almost effortlessly pulled this character with so much depth and motivation. I can't understand why she wasn't nominated for an oscar. Emma Stone did not have a overwhelmingly better performance than Amy's considering the fact that Adams did this in a sci-fi movie and Emma did it in a musical. It is disturbing to see her too (after Matthew McConaughey for Interstellar) being robbed of a Oscar nomination in her case by Maryl who was probably nominated only for being a Hollywood legend like Denzel in the same year(because the next year she was nominated again). Next, the visuals are outstanding but compared to Jungle Book they couldn't match those. The score was great... a very haunting score that suited almost every scene. The story is absolutely fantastic. It reminded me a little about Interstellar's story and it kinda resembles to that in way. It has the emotional pump by the end just like Interstellar did and it also has twist and turns you wouldn't expect in a sci-fi like this. Another thing I liked was the realism in it. Just like in interstellar it starts with scientifical concepts and then takes turns and new directions that go in the sci-fi realm and actually surprised me a lot. There are also flashbacks which in the beginning seemed unnecessary but by the end went full-circle and had such a tremendous impact on me. No point trying to point out the directing and cinematography which are all fantastic. I have only two gripes with the movie and that is spoiler territory which I'll address bellow, but aside from that this movie is flawless and is so similar with Interstellar that for me is impossible to not like it and consider it one of the best sci-fi ever.<br/><br/>***SPOILER HERE***
So the thing that bothered me was that the movie never fully explained who were the aliens and why they'll need human help in 3000 years. The second and last thing that bothered me was that in the end the aliens and Louise were able to talk so easily with each other despite the fact that they spend more than half the time of the movie trying to learn each other's language.
***END OF SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Aside from that this movie is awesome and mind-blowing with fantastic performances and great story. It amazes me how this movie got nominated for best picture, director, adapted screenplay, cinematography, production and sound and Interstellar didn't receive any nominations for cinematography, directing or motion picture since they are pretty much the same thematical movies. 10/10"
"ChaWiFu","7","1","3","18 January 2018"," It's drama, with a Sci-Fi backdrop
","If you want to see some great Sci-Fi about a linguist and a scientist attempting to communicate with aliens...that movie hasn't been made yet.<br/><br/>***spoilers begin here***<br/><br/>This movie is simply about a woman who learns that her future daughter will die early of cancer as a teen. Even knowing this, she chooses to have her daughter anyway. The times they shared together were worth the pain and loss yet to come.<br/><br/>The backdrop of aliens, language, science and time are simply a set up for allowing the woman to see the future. Nothing more. <br/><br/>If the movie were to be rated as a Sci-Fi film it would receive poor ratings - as evidenced by reviews saying as much. This point is where the marketers of the movie missed the mark. <br/><br/>There are a few Science Fiction elements and some moments that are interesting in that aspect, but the science of the movie is too...fictional. The actions of the world-wide scientists and leaders is not believable and the role of Renner as a scientist is underutilized (dare say...not utilized at all). The linguistic methods of deciphering the language are glossed over and the science behind the methods not even mentioned.<br/><br/>But again, this isn't really Sci-Fi. Were the movie in a different setting away from Aliens Arriving on Earth, there would be fewer criticisms. <br/><br/>Reviewing the movie as a drama about the decisions of a future mother-to-be gives a better representation of the film's content. <br/><br/>In that aspect, it is a difficult, heart-wrenching drama that makes the viewer question the judgment of the character since she knew what the outcome would be.<br/><br/>Was the daughter being born a requirement for the future to work out correctly 3000 years from then? The movies suggests not. <br/><br/>Then was Adam's character self-serving to have the child even though the child would die an early death through disease? <br/><br/>Would the child prefer to have lived even knowing her own future?<br/><br/>Renner's character leaves the family when he finds out Adams knew the daughter would die. He tells her that ""She made the wrong decision.""<br/><br/>It's up to the viewer to choose what is right."

"gcsman","10","1","3","20 November 2017"," A triumph for Amy Adams, and for science fiction in film
","Rating a film 10/10 is very rare for me, but this one absolutely deserves it. It's a masterwork from Denis Villeneuve, and this is also a triumph for Amy Adams. She joins a very small list of first-rate actresses who carried the entire weight of a science fiction movie on their shoulders, along with Jodie Foster (Contact), Helen Hunt (Twister), and Sandra Bullock (Gravity). In ""Arrival"", Jeremy Renner gets co-lead billing (and is excellent as well) but it's really Adams who is the story from start to finish.<br/><br/>It's based on ""The Story of Your Life"" by writer Ted Chiang, but Villeneuve and his writing crew made quite a few pretty substantial changes, and I think the result is actually better on screen that it was on the page. In Chiang's story, the aliens (the Heptapods) stay in orbit, and communicate with humans only by way of a sort of holograph station on the ground. And when they leave again, they just ... go. No explanation given and no closure to the story. The movie is, overall, a richer and more satisfying experience.<br/><br/>This movie is unapologetically cerebral in the way it's built on the central concepts of language and communication. How do you start communicating with these new aliens when you have to start from ground zero with absolutely NOTHING in common (not even your planet)? Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the linguist, is the central player in the team that gets it done, and bit by fascinating bit we get to see how it happens. The process is not rushed, and (!) despite the military camp setting where the action happens, it's not violent. (There is one smallish explosion, and a bit of offstage gunfire, but that's it.) What a pleasure to watch a science fiction film that's not just a CGI slugfest. Actually, those so-called action-SF films aren't really SF at all - they're just the empty, boring calories of eye candy. ""Arrival"" is the real thing. It's an intelligent, idea-driven, gripping story that lives and breathes in an imagined world just beyond our own.<br/><br/>One feature of the story that I liked very much was the simple but effective device that not everything was explained. Who are the heptapods, really, and where did they come from? How do they control gravity within their ships, and how do they manage interstellar travel? Most of all, why contact us? We understand by the end that they came here to teach us their language because 3000 years in the future they are going to need us, but what exactly are we going to do for them? These things are just left for us to think over. The same approach was used in Robert Zemeckis' ""Contact"" (1997), when the alien race who transmit The Message to us bring Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) through a series of wormholes to meet them. But then we learn that these aliens did NOT build the wormholes, and they don't know who did; all they can say is ""Maybe they'll come back some day."" All of a sudden, yet another vista opens up. Though the benevolent Messagers are staggeringly more advanced than humans, somewhere/when there are the Tunnel Builders who are just as far beyond them. Levels upon levels. Both of these films gain extra depth and richness by invoking vastly wider context lying beyond what we get to see.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT! From here on, don't read if you haven't yet seen the film.) On a different level, the story is about Louise herself and her personal journey. Adams' understated style perfectly fits the character of a woman who's introverted by nature but who has the quiet confidence of an accomplished expert in her field. Her eyes always reveal that she's thinking and observing. At the beginning, the impression from a fragmented series of little flashbacks is that she must have lost a child to terminal illness but has moved on from that tragedy to continue with her academic university life. Then the aliens arrive, in a dozen locations all over the Earth; they're not attacking, not actually doing anything at all, but not leaving either. She's conscripted to help with the project of how to talk to them. Physicist Ian Donnelly (Renner), as team leader, develops into a close co-worker and eventually into a fledgling romantic interest. But her flashbacks continue, getting worse and worse as she succeeds in getting deeper into the Heptapods' minds. It's a slow-burn mystery, and somewhere along the line it gradually becomes clear that she's quite literally remembering her own future, not her past. At this point, the story becomes not just a path to solving the puzzle of the aliens' logographic language, but a kind of time-travel SF. Louise is going to succeed in learning Heptapod because, in the future, she HAS succeeded, and can reach back to teach herself (with the help of the clues the Heptapods plant in her). The fact that her actions save the world from nuclear war and set humanity on a new path are just nice byproducts of the storyline. Closing the loop brings the story to a completely satisfying end.<br/><br/>The most memorable line in the film is, without a doubt, ""Abbott is death process"", though I'm admittedly lifting it out of the context that gives it full meaning. This gently spoken little bit of dialog, translated from Heptapod, has to be among the most poignant in any movie. I'd love to see more of Ted Chiang's intelligent stories put onto the screen. One that would work particularly well should be his ""Tower of Babel"" which is just mind-bendingly clever and would look great on the screen."

"shelley-bourdon","10","1","3","12 November 2017"," This Sci-fi Masterpiece Teaches Us about Time and as Well as Love
","Having recently watched the movie Arrival for the second time (I loved it so much, once was not enough!), I was confused as to how anyone who had viewed this movie could possibly give it a rating of ""1."" After reading through a good number of the 1- rated reviews, I've concluded that these individuals, in addition to being mean- spirited, missed a very important fact about this movie. This sci-fi story, which deals with the concept of non-linear time, demonstrates how language helps to shape our view of time. <br/><br/>The development of our language is, in large part, dependent upon the physical aspects of our bodies, which, of course, our planet's environment helps to determine (i.e., a planet with a super-strong force of gravity will foster the growth of smaller physical bodies than, say, a planet with a weaker force of gravity; a planet that is mostly liquid will foster the growth of physical bodies that have ways of ""swimming"" through that liquid, while a planet that has a lot of dry land will foster the growth of bodies that ambulate across the land with physical appendages that ""walk"" rather than swim). If you look at the human body, with its pair of eyes that are placed on the front of our heads, it makes sense that we view reality primarily through the lens of linear time. Because of the placement of our eyes, we literally see ourselves ""moving forward"" every day, and our language supports such a view. Not only do we often speak of ""moving forward"" on a project, we also refer to someone as ""backwards"" when that person does not display ""forward thinking."" <br/><br/>But what if our bodies had been constructed differently? What if we had multiple eyes that wrapped around our heads, allowing us a 360-degree view of our environment in every waking moment? We might have designed a world view that incorporated non- linear aspects of time, and our language would most definitely have reflected such a view. If, though, in traveling to another planet, we attempted to teach our language (steeped in the concepts of non-linear time) to another species (not steeped in non- linear time), as they learned our language that might cause a shift in the perceptions of those other beings so that they were able to grasp, more easily, the concept of non-linear time. And this might, in turn, begin to change those beings' perception of ""reality,"" simply because they would be viewing reality through a different lens.<br/><br/>Already we have humans upon our planet (some of our physicists, for instance) who are able to view time in a non-linear fashion. Einstein once wrote that ""People like us, who believe in physics, know the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" I believe it is the language of mathematics that has helped these physicists to look outside the box of our conventional perception of time. However, if one is not mathematically inclined (and I include myself in this category), watching the movie Arrival can help, I have found, to nudge one's mind into a new way of perceiving time. <br/><br/>But, as much as I love how this film portrays the concept of non-linear time (and demonstrates how language can impact the way we view time), there is one other aspect of this film that is, in my opinion, equally important: this film is a visually beautiful portrait of a mother's love for her daughter. Loving a child often pierces the heart in a way that no other type of love does. It is as if, through the act of loving a child, a permanent imprint of the child is left upon the heart forever. It is, I have found, a gift to love a child (even when that child is not so easy to love). You learn how to put the needs of another ahead of your own, and that helps us to learn how to be a little less selfish and a little less self-centered. The portrait of a mother's love for her daughter, found within the film Arrival, is one of the most ""real"" depictions of parental love for a child that I have found in the World of Fiction. Both times I have watched this film, this portrait of a mother's love for her child has moved me to tears. <br/><br/>In my opinion, Arrival is a perfect ""10,"" a movie that I will enjoy watching again and again. From the bottom of my heart, I sincerely thank every single individual who contributed to the production of this sci-fi masterpiece!"

There are many fine ""real"" scifi movies, but Arrival just didn't hit home for me.<br/><br/>Looks great, acting is pretty good, soundtrack OK. The idea is kind of OK in general, but the first real problem for me was that I kept thinking (no pun intended) that why would the aliens have spoken and written language to begin with. Why assume aliens would have that much in common with us. Like they used to paint actors green to distinguish them from humans and make them alien. I kind of needed more than decoding different style of writing.<br/><br/>Acting like said is pretty good, but like has been said in other reviews, everyone except for Amy Adams' are very thin characters. Renner shows promise, but it's a shame his character is so under developed, especially due to the ending ""twist"" of the movie. There's no revelation there, just a somewhat predictable twist, but with more in the script for Renner, it might've been better.<br/><br/>I have to admit even I felt this movie was a bit boring at times. I kept looking at the watch and thinking now would be a good time to thrust the script, and often it did find a new twist to it, but it never really gets very interesting.<br/><br/>I don't know, it didn't work for me at least in the first viewing. The part with social chaos, soldiers vs personal growth, how we perceive time etc didn't feel at balance. I may need to watch it again to see what the fuzz is about.

People start panicking and governments begin mobilizing, which I suppose is only natural. But let's face it. If they wanted to kill us, then given their advanced technology, there wouldn't be anything we could do about it. Be that as it may, because of Banks' language skills, Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) shows up in her office to enlist her in translating the language of the aliens. Weber plays her a snippet of the aliens talking, which lasts just a few seconds, and he asks her what she makes of it, as if anyone could translate a completely alien language from such a small sample. I was hoping her reply would be, ""He said, 'Take me to your leader.'""<br/><br/>Banks says she would have to interact with the aliens in person to be able to communicate with them. Weber refuses and says he is going to Berkeley to see if Dr. Danvers will work for them instead. Banks says, ""Before you commit to him, ask him the Sanskrit word for war and its translation."" Is this a trick question? The translation of the Sanskrit word for war has to be ""war""; otherwise, it's not the Sanskrit word for war. Presumably, she is talking about the etymology of that word, which is ""gavisti,"" rather than its translation. In that sense, I suppose you could say that the ""translation"" of the Spanish word for pregnant is ""embarrassed,"" for example. Anyway, the whole point of this is Banks' way of letting them know that Danvers is second rate. When Weber finds out that Danvers thinks the translation of ""gavisti"" is ""an argument,"" whereas Banks knows that it is actually ""a desire for more cows,"" Weber knows that he must give in to her demands to meet with the aliens. Thank goodness Weber didn't enlist Danvers for the job! With his second-rate language skills, he might have caused an intergalactic incident.<br/><br/>On her way to the aliens in Montana, she meets Dr. Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist. He quotes from the preface of one of her books, ""Language is the foundation of civilization,"" and then tells her she is wrong, because, as he puts it, ""The cornerstone of civilization isn't language, it's science."" I guess this is the movie's way of introducing some kind of science-versus-the-humanities conflict into the story, but we cannot help but feel we are being manipulated into being on Banks' side, for it is beyond obvious that you can have language without science, but you cannot have science without language. And just in case we missed it, the point is further driven home when they arrive at the place where Banks is going to get some facetime with the aliens so she can learn how to speak Alienish. Donnelly asks if the aliens have responded to things like Fibonacci numbers. Weber has to point out to him that they are still working on the responses to the word ""Hello.""<br/><br/>However, even Weber seems a little obtuse on this point. He later complains that the vocabulary list that Banks has constructed has words like ""eat"" and ""walk,"" which he calls grade school words. Didn't he take a foreign language course when he was in school? We all know that you have to start off with common words like ""eat"" and ""walk"" in the beginning, that you have to learn how to say things like, ""Where is the library?"" before you can start having complicated discussions about whether the aliens intend to kill us. Once again, the movie forces us to identify with Banks, because everyone else in the movie seems to be a little bit thick.<br/><br/>Now, it seems to me that if the aliens have the technology to travel light-years across space, they have the technology to receive our television broadcasts, by which they could have learned to speak English before they ever got here. But the problem with that, according to the movie's version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, if the aliens learned to speak English it would rewire their brains, and the next thing you know, they would become rational like us. That would never do. So, Banks has to learn Alienish, which will rewire her brain so that she can grasp the mystical premise of this movie, which has something to do with the Eternal-Now and the Oneness-of-Allness. This is why, presumably, their written sentences are basically circles with curlicues. Our sentences have a beginning and an end, but the circular expressions of their thoughts defy such a linear manner of thinking. The practical consequence of this mystical premise is that the future has already happened. In fact, the aliens are helping us now to become One with each other so that three thousand years later, we will help them.<br/><br/>Furthermore, what we saw at the beginning of the movie is actually what will happen later after she marries Donnelly, and all the flashbacks she was having about her daughter were really flashforwards. In one of those flashforwards, she tells her daughter that Daddy became angry and said she made the wrong choice, after which he divorced her. The choice in question had to do with her deciding to have a child even though she knew the child would die from a rare, incurable disease. My guess is that he said something like, ""Why the hell didn't we go to a fertility clinic and get the bad gene removed?"" But that would just be the same old, rational, scientific, linear way of thinking that comes from speaking English."

","This is an engaging movie with a few familiar themes: huge and mysterious spacecraft suddenly show up, first contact with aliens, science vs. military, individual effort battling group think. But what gives this film its real pizazz is the 'flashback' under-plot that starts early on and only becomes (moderately) comprehensible after various revelations and breakthroughs that emerge gradually from the main plot. Because of this, the story is quite complex and keeps the unraveling in progress all the way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, however, the denouement is (to me) unsatisfying. No amount of arm-waving is going to convince me of the main premise, which shall remain unrevealed.<br/><br/>A very interesting movie, but left me disappointed. Maybe I should read the story it is based on."
"TxMike","Null","1","3","4 May 2017"," ""Life's a journey, not a destination.""
","We watched this at home on DVD from our public library. <br/><br/>This movie is a distinct departure from most Sci-Fi movies. There is very little action, it moves rather slowly most of the time, and is mostly a study of relationships in the broadest term. <br/><br/>With no fanfare and no warning 12 mysterious, elongated vessels appear around the world, one of them in remote Montana. They are said to be about 1500 feet tall and hover a few feet above the ground, with no detectable energy or waste. Certainly alien craft, what are they here for?<br/><br/>Each country approaches each of the 12 independently, trying to figure out how to communicate with them, yet eventually they cease to cooperate, to share their progress. For the one in Montana Amy Adams as linguistics professor Louise Banks is recruited to help. As well as Jeremy Renner as Mathematician Ian Donnelly. The military official in charge of the approach and investigate operation is old reliable Forest Whitaker as taskmaster Colonel Weber.<br/><br/>The mysterious vessel apparently opens a door at a certain time each day, allowing a team dressed in full biosafe gear to enter into an anti-gravity chamber. They bring along a Canary, as long as it tweets then they are assured they are safe. They try to communicate with the Heptapods, separated from their hazy enclosure by some sort of transparent, glass-like barrier.<br/><br/>So what the story is about concerns how we communicate with each other and try to communicate with others, in this extreme case aliens who draw circles with features. Eventually it is interpreted that they are here to share a gift, and that involves overcoming the barriers of time. <br/><br/>In a sense the overriding theme of the story is ""Life's a journey, not a destination."" Throughout we witness Louise's flashbacks, of a husband, a young daughter, but in the end we realize that it was a preview of what was to happen. Her thoughts transcending time.<br/><br/>So, did we enjoy the movie? Yes, we did, as always Amy Adams is great and the story is interesting. We don't view it with the high reverence that many do, while it uses rather creative ideas in the end it is all fiction and has no lasting implication, except maybe to be more diligent in respecting others and communicating well. But most of us already perceive that without seeing it in a movie."

All the while it lays the breadcrumbs for a third act reveal (I'd hesitate to use the word twist here) that may not satisfy everyone.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","16 April 2017"," The additions to the original short story water down this scifi experience
","This is the first Denis Villeneuve film I've actually liked, and it gives me hope for the upcoming Blade Runner 2049, which is a sequel for the 1982 classic. It's based on a short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang, and the basic premise goes that twelve alien ships have arrived to Earth. Each has seemingly randomly chosen a spot on Earth to hover over and after a certain amount of time a door always opens, letting explorers in. The movie is told from the point of view of Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a world-class linguist, who's been tasked with communicating with the aliens.<br/><br/>On many levels it is an extremely refreshing science fiction experience. It focuses heavily on the protocols of first contact and the difficulties of trying to communicate with a new civilization that's so removed from our own as to make the task almost impossible. That might sound boring to some, but the film is anything but. Insert some unforeseen twists and difficulties, which I shall not spoil here, and we have a more than decent story in our hands.<br/><br/>It's also technically superb, as well as well-acted all around. The film looks absolutely fantastic, which has always been Villeneuve's strong suit, but in this he really pulled out all the stops. The first slow shot we get of the alien ship hovering above a misty valley is some of the finest visual cinema I've experienced in years. The whole film has this gritty realism applied to some pretty outlandish visuals and concepts, and it works beautifully. Also huge props for Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, playing the other scientist in charge of communications. Both are really talented actors, but the show absolutely goes to Adams.<br/><br/>Where the film unfortunately loses me a bit is in the additions made to the original short story. There was some military presence in the original as well, but here it has been brought into the spotlight, which doesn't make the film any stronger. The original concept and the original themes were already strong enough. Throwing in some inept criticism against redneck armed forces and strong arm negotiation tactics only takes our focus away from the main idea. The plot also moves around pretty clunkily. For example, there's this general mentioned early on in the film, seemingly casually in the background, but each and every member in the audience could instantly tell that he was going to return to screw something up. The film is full of moments like this, which also takes away from the central idea by pulling on our suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, despite its flaws, Arrival is a good scifi film. It had the potential to be a great one and there are definitely flashes of that greatness scattered throughout the film. Unfortunately the task of telling a coherent and structured story is where Villeneuve drops the ball a bit. Still very much worth a watch for all those looking for something new in the scifi genre."

We are here to help you, (which they kinda didn't). But in return you must help us in 300 years? Help with what? and why if they are so advanced do they make us spend months learning their stupid language. Was it just to make everyone work together? It led us to brink of war for goodness sake, what if the main character hadn't figured it all out....then what? It was just to much faith and wishy-washy working together crap for me to take what the film makers were selling seriously. <br/><br/>It was beautiful shot though."
"ReganRebecca","7","1","3","27 February 2017"," Not quite my taste
","I really wanted to love Arrival. I'm a fan of so called ""smart"" sci-fi, stuff that manages to bend out of this world stuff with beauty. Arrival was one of those movies that seemed to tick all the boxes (female led, prestige cast and crew) but I found myself a bit let down. <br/><br/>The movie is about Louise Banks, a university professor of languages who we first meet in the opening frames of the movie as her she takes care of and raises her young daughter, only to lose her when she is still very young. We then see Louise at her job when 12 alien space ships land at an assortment of random locations around the world. Because of some earlier work she did translating for the military, Louise ends up getting assigned a job helping the army translate and talk to the aliens (quickly dubbed heptapods). Louise and her partner Ian end up becoming close to the two heptapods that try to communicate with them, and they struggle to figure out what to say and how to say it before the trigger happy government attacks the aliens and starts a war they might not win. <br/><br/>There's a lot to admire about Arrival. Amy Adams is great here as Louise (sadly snubbed for an Oscar despite the film receiving multiple nominations). The tech work is also very good. This isn't a movie that goes for intensely gorgeous visuals, but there is still eye-candy in the form of the written version of the alien language. <br/><br/>The central story and the ""twist"" at the centre of it is really great too, and it's only something that will enrich the film in multiple viewings. And yet despite the intimate story there was something about the film that just didn't work for me, primarily the nitty gritty details of the script. Despite the elegant structure and ideas there's some dialogue that's too quippy and on the nose and there's this whole section in the middle that is just five minutes of information dropping voice-over over montage. It's a weirdly lazy technique for a film that sweats the details. There's also a relationship that ends up being central to the ending and the plot that I never quite bought and doesn't feel organic at all. <br/><br/>Your mileage may vary. While I never quite succeeded in feeling that emotional connection that would have elevated the film from good to excellent I can see from the ratings and reviews that others just don't have that problem."

I was expecting something more bold - the Aliens just came here to show some calligraphy of languages? OK, yes, the language is the key to open the possibility to bend the time axis psychologically. But, does this imply that the setting here is that everything is predetermined? ... I would really wish this movie can go deeper about their setting of the world."

","""Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating,"" scoffs Jim Carrey's lovelorn protagonist in 2004's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. He'd get right along with Amy Adams' linguistics specialist, Dr. Louise Brooks, from Denis Villeneuve's Arrival. Like Eternal Sunshine, it's a elegant, grounded but stylized portrait of grief and profound communication breakdowns amidst an almost-plausible science-fiction landscape. However, Villeneuve's film also makes its mark as one of the most haunting, introspective, and tautly, fiendishly clever films of the last several years. <br/><br/>Like most of the best sci-fi, Arrival is not really 'about' the aliens it introduces (don't worry, that's not a spoiler), but rather what they draw out in the humans whose lives they enigmatically appear in sans explanation. Their monolithic, oblong spaceships peppering the planet not only contribute to the pantheon of evocative sci-fi imagery, but also serve as handy ciphers for social commentary. To many, they're instantly a threat, or superfluous beyond their potential for extraterrestrial weaponization (or both), and there's a chortle to be had in how unsurprising it is the film plays out amidst the cradle of stifling U.S. military bureaucracy. But screenwriter Eric Heisserer also neatly weaves in the story of Dr. Brooks, anchoring the macro conflict on her own personal interactions with the aliens as a focal point and refuge from her own almost vegetative loneliness and grief. He and Villeneuve allow Brooks' own drama to teasingly dance amidst the global histrionics, with the key conflict not being the extraterrestrials demanding to be taken to our leader, but our wishing we shared the vocabulary to express such sentiments beyond the mysterious Rorschach test ink blots they spew, like union negotiations told through smoke rings. <br/><br/>Fittingly, in a film revolving around communication, Villeneuve is coy about showing his film's thematic and narrative hand too early. Planting firmly in the Close Encounters of the Third Kind school of mature, muted sci-fi, Villeneuve practically cackles with delight in exploiting every (good) trick in nonlinear storytelling book, using masterful editing to unspool wrinkles of story that carry unexpected waves of devastation and devastating hope. Here, Heisserer's screenplay is clever to a fault in its lean simplicity, finding power and poignancy in stark images (Brooks reveals that the Chinese military have been teaching the aliens to communicate through mah-jong, thereby establishing an inherently adversarial dynamic), with even certain lines that initially play as clunky instead proving to be red herrings, retroactively revealed as urgent clues and secret foreshadowing. It's unquestionably a slow-burner, with Villeneuve's pacing remaining firmly steady throughout, which, at times, grates against the brewing sociopolitical state of emergency, and a clinical feel that at times verges on excessively emotionally sterile. Still, the film's masterfully precise technical prowess alone makes the film worth viewing in cinemas. Bradford Young's dreamily gliding cinematography, composer Jóhann Jóhannsson's whimsically, playfully twinkling score, and some of the most unerringly spot-on sound editing in recent memory (to say nothing of the gorgeous scenic filming locations) all conflate to establish a blanket of eerie serenity amidst the global chaos. It's a fishbowl feeling that Villeneuve stirs from restlessness into deliberate claustrophobia in the final act, but, by gosh, if an audience is to be trapped in a fishbowl, it may as well be a fishbowl as beautiful as this. <br/><br/>Many leading actors working amidst such old-school sci-fi would have succumbed to the temptation to punch up the disquieting calmness with heavy-handed scene- stealing. Thankfully, Amy Adams is a far wiser and intuitive performer than that. Her work here is exceptional in its quietness, her subtle ebb of emotions throughout seeping into the viewer like a gentle rain flecked with the lightning surges of her perilously fleeting interactions with her daughter. She abjectly avoids any Oscar- baiting melodrama in favour of simply embodying Brooks like a comfortable slipper, making it one of the most affecting and truthful performances of a woman in pain we've seen in some time. Conversely, Jeremy Renner gives a sturdy performance throughout, but he's so bland and indistinct that his casting as a character too easily regulated to expositional fountain is instantly forgettable. Nonetheless, Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg each excel at no-nonsense resonance as the commander and PR exec of the governing military, their strained and often contradictory grimness exposing the lion's share of social commentary. <br/><br/>""What is your purpose here?"" is the guiding question for Brooks and her team. Arrival's is far less reticent. It's a story about a mother and her daughter. It's a story about a planet learning to listen. And it's a story about how time and love are the only truly reliable concepts, but not necessarily in that order. Like its depicted otherworldly visitors, Arrival is distinctly odd and discomfortingly tranquil, but stirringly mesmerizing, supremely clever, and surprisingly rewarding. Most of all, it's unassumingly unforgettable, and primed to take its place amidst the great science- fiction of the era. <br/><br/>-9/10"

","Arrival seemed to kind of come out of nowhere. Released at the end of the year without a ton of promotion and publicity, the film has nonetheless had tremendous staying power and has continued to build its box office gross through word of mouth, becoming one of the surprise hits of the past year. While not a mega Blockbuster like Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (also a solid recommendation), the success of Arrival proves that audiences still respond to stories that aren't dependent on wall to wall action and explosions. Some may see Arrival as boring. The marketing, after all, made the film seem more action-packed than the final cut actually is. But even if the movie isn't always super fast paced, it's always at least interesting and intriguing to watch. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner give probably the best performances of their careers, giving life to characters that might not have seemed completely three-dimensional on the page. Renner and Adams share great chemistry and absolutely sell moments that could have come off cheesy or schmaltzy. The selling point of Arrival may be the alien story line, but Renner and Adams are the movie. This is really an actors' movie. However, my only one complaint about Arrival is there could have been one or two more scenes developing Renner's character and his motivations/relationship with Adams. Doing so would have been the finale slightly stronger, even it still an extremely effective ending. There are those who will be split on the ending of Arrival. Some will love it, others will absolutely hate it. I found it to be the most memorable ending of any movie of 2016. The ending begs audiences to rewatch the movie again, something I'll have no problem doing in the near future. Arrival is the best sci-fi film to come out in years. 9/10"

But after that I felt let down. <br/><br/>12 black block things arrive at random points on the earth. <br/><br/>Doors open in them every eighteen hours and people can go in and try to communicate with aliens. <br/><br/>The race is on for nations of the world to decipher the alien language and communicate. What are the Aliens intentions ? <br/><br/>We all wanted to know the answer to this.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is Dr Louise Banks a gifted linquist/translator brought in by the U.S. military to try and decipher communications from Aliens via the black block thingy hovering over Montana. <br/><br/>Where it gets a bit silly was how the military (led by Forest Whittaker) are Hollywood military stereotype stupid. <br/><br/>They bring in 'experts' but don't want to listen. Everything is a threat, if in doubt shoot it. The Chinese military have the same stereotype stupidity and intend to attack, supported by other countries. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>What I found irritating was several aspects: <br/><br/>All through the film we are shown Louise Banks apparently having 'flashbacks'. She has a daughter and an unseen husband. Her daughter is born in flashbacks and you see parent/childhood memories 'flashbacks'. The daughter gets cancer and dies. Turns out she is dreaming of the future. <br/><br/>She even has flash forwards where she sees she phones the Chinese and stops them attacking. She knows the Chinese generals number and what his wife said on her death bed to convince him of the truth. <br/><br/>It doesn't actually explain how she got this number let alone knew the death bed speech in the first place. (The audience are clearly not expected to ask questions) <br/><br/>Louise Banks seems to be the great translator and has 'cracked' much of the alien symbols language. <br/><br/>However, the soldiers escorting the scientists into the Alien block each time seem remarkably stupid. So stupid and scared, they decided to place a time bomb in the black block thing 'to send a message' to the aliens. <br/><br/>Surely they would have vetted these soldiers more? (The audience are clearly not expected question stupid things) <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner plays a physicist who doesn't actually do very much.

The message it imposes is also very meaningful and really says something about society. I would say this is one of the best films of the year. The coloring was decent, it had a tone of light blue and grey which is fine, not really my style but it fits the movie. The realistic aspects such as chaos within cities and countries communicating was very well done.

"tapio_hietamaki","10","2","11","3 February 2017"," A stellar story of alien visitation, language barriers, scientists and human grief
","Based on Ted Chiand's brilliant science fiction short story 'The Story of Your Life' and directed by Denis Villeneuve, it is no wonder this movie turned out to be good. Villeneuve is a master of puzzles and ambiguity, as his previous movie 'Enemy' demonstrated, and he is no stranger to intense atmosphere either, as seen in 'Sicario'. 'Arrival' has a bit of both, and it also brings warm humanity into the mix. Paradoxical as it is in a movie about alien visitation, 'Arrival' is a story about human emotions at its heart. It is a story of love and grief and letting go and I'm not ashamed to say that it brought me to tears.<br/><br/>The movie is largely carried by three things: Amy Adams' moving acting performance, the central mystery of the story that slowly unravels, and the otherworldly atmosphere that comes from the unnatural design of the monolithic spaceships and the disturbing yet beautiful musical score. Quite like 'Contact' - another one of my favorite science fiction movies - the movie is not an action adventure but focuses on actual science, hypothetical as it may be, and like in 'Contact', the science makes way for the emotional content and the protagonist's character arc.<br/><br/>The short story 'The Story of Your Life' is mainly focused on the alien language and the science of linguistics. The movie follows suit, though it adds some things to spice it up a bit. But the linguistics are central to the story, and they are fascinating. The aliens have a writing system that does not correspond to the sounds they make but is an entirely self-contained language. They use a single symbol to represent several words and even several phrases, piling layers of meaning onto the symbol until it is nearly impossible for humans to distinguish all that the symbol contains. This is so delightfully alien and yet so frighteningly plausible that the thought makes me squirm.<br/><br/>By the way: the film's title refers to more than just the arrival of the aliens."
"Dorjee_Wang","9","2","11","16 January 2017"," Marvellous movie
","Arrival might be the best work by Denis Villenueve (Sicario, Incendies, Prisoners) and the smartest piece of sci-fi since Alfonso Cuaron's 2013 film Gravity. Based on a short story ""Story of My Life"" by Ted Chiang, the film's an introspective piece of work which'll not only get the viewers talking about it but will also get their emotions reeling. It's so unlike any sci-fi movie ever done before as it sheds the weight of war and thrill and focuses purely on inability to communicate properly with the extraterrestrial and one's perception.<br/><br/>Unlike some of the previous works by Villenueve, Arrival reflects on the better side of humanity by interplaying the relationships between the two species. Yet it's still full of mystery and marvel as the intentions are truly left unclear until the end. The flashes of scenes is brilliantly edited in the present context of the movie, and makes the screenplay very emotive and reflective. It compounds views on what one's actions can lead to. The smartest decision by Villenueve might be the trade off between heavy reliance on special effects and focus on emotions and perception. This not only propels the message behind the screenplay, but the subtle effects also complements the ambiance.<br/><br/>The cinematography is simply beautiful. And if the movie does not get an Academy award nomination (or a win) for it, I shall forever resent them. It's beautifully done and features references to classics like 2001: The Space Odyssey and the Day the Earth Stood Still. The score only aims to complement the movie more. The art direction is greatly done as well, as the empty vast space inside the supposed shuttle only goes on to elevate the mystery of the movie even more.<br/><br/>But the true hero of the movie's not the brilliant screenplay nor the cinematography but it's Amy Adams. The movie quintessentially work on the basis of her performance. Adams sheds her usual demeanor for a very subdued performance here and it simply works wonder. Playing a linguist tasked with deciphering the ambiguous language from scratch while fighting her own fears. She's phenomenal here, her body language, her countenance, it only makes the movie more compelling than it already is. I would go so far as to exclaim it the best performance she has given since Doubt.<br/><br/>The movie's not without its flaws though, running at a length of about 120 minutes the screenplay can get lax by the end. Whitaker, who's a wonderful actor is entirely wasted here as his character falls behind the scene for a big length of the time. Renner fails to contribute anything to the movie as well and could've been easily swapped out by anyone and it wouldn't matter.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie's an intellectual piece of work, which will not only work your emotions but also get you thinking, carried by a brilliant performance by Adams and marvelous technical work, Arrival's a must watch for not just sci-fi fans but any moviegoer. 9/10"
"domdalmasso","9","2","11","15 January 2017"," One of a kind
","Very well scripted, and surprisingly human. This movie is about aliens, yet the main focus is Amy Adam's character: her experiences, her choices, her feelings. In the reviews that gave this movie a low rating, I find a reoccurring theme: ""the movie is boring"". I think this has more to say about the viewer than the movie. Boring as in there isn't a lot of action... Sure. But boring is the last thing I would call this movie. It was fascinating, I was all eyes and all ears. Unique sci-fi movie, one of a kind, not action packed like you might expect, but beautiful movie nonetheless. Love the play on colors and the close focus lens in this movie. Cool concepts too. 9 out of 10"
"Velvetier","Null","2","11","20 November 2016"," Why do people either love this or hate it? (Some spoilers)
","I'm surprised at all the 1 star and 10 star reviews of this film. So people either love it or hate it? Most films are around 6-7 stars for me. Films tend to be a mixed bag for me. <br/><br/>I thought this was a good movie, for the most part. It had a nice story, fine cinematography, a cerebral ""puzzle"", moving moments, and decent acting. I thought this would be nominated for a few Academy Awards. This reminds me of M. Night Shyamalan films - sophisticated puzzles, a ""think piece,"" a bit gimmicky. <br/><br/>Racism and stereotypes are rampant in most American films. Arrival is based on a short story by Ted Chiang. He's Chinese American, but none of his stories have ANYTHING Asian in them. In the film, they put in the usual ""China-is-the-bad-guy"" crap - nothing new. They ALSO decided to make the white woman the SAVIOR who reforms the evil Chinese general. That's as old as Hollywood itself. A similar film is Anna and the King (1999), where Jodie Foster, the mighty and attractive white woman, comes to save the day - she ""reforms"" the backwards, misogynist Thai king played by Chow Yun-Fat. White people fixing up bad, backwards Asians is as old as time itself. And it insinuates itself into EVERYTHING, not just films. <br/><br/>Basically, US films, including Arrival, loves hammering in this:<br/><br/>-White = good, right, almighty -Asian/Chinese = wrong, backwards, evil, avoid, look down on<br/><br/>In the short story that Arrival was based on, Chiang failed to have ANYTHING Asian in it. That's the way he thinks and operates - every one of his 15 stories only have WHITE PEOPLE. To be an Asian American and to ONLY have whites in ALL your stories - what does that mean?! He thinks he's white, only hangs out with whites, and is, basically, white. For some reason, the film deviated from the story in that they decided to throw in an evil Chinese general who's out to destroy the universe. Maybe the Quebecois director decided to throw that in, and it had the COMPLETE approval of Chiang. <br/><br/>Chiang's one of the plentiful Chinese Americans who hate China and anything Chinese. That's a given - we grew up in a country that really hates us, so we hate ourselves and try to get as far away from our ancestral roots as possible. Chiang even wrote a New Yorker article bashing Chinese characters and claiming it's far inferior to English and Indo-European languages. Okay! <br/><br/>The guy who played the Chinese general is some actor named Tsi Ma. He has a long & acclaimed career, though none of us have heard of him. Despite his authoritative presence in the film, you can see Amy Adams looks down on him. See her face as she faces him in the grand party scene - she loses her usual pretty look and just looks blah. She's seeing a plain, slant-eyed Chinese man, and she finds his look, and his self, unappealing. That sums up how all people see Chinese people - even those with illustrious careers & an authoritative presence. <br/><br/>Adams' Mandarin is absolutely atrocious in the film. It shows is that she really doesn't like the Mandarin language, or Asian people. She doesn't BOTHER to want to learn to pronounce those few lines better. This reminds me of the time Emma Watson & Daniel Radcliffe spoke some Mandarin, and Watson butchered it in the most embarrassing way. That's because she, and most people, simply have no respect or love for the Chinese language, Chinese people, or China and its related lands. <br/><br/>Also, I have no idea why Adams' character spoke Mandarin to the Chinese general on the phone, and then he spoke perfect English to her when they met. This shows that people think Chinese don't know any English. Leave it to the brilliant, mighty white woman to bow down to the backwards Chinese by speaking (terrible) Mandarin - when pretty much all high-level leaders in the world speak FLUENT English, including, apparently, this general when they met in the formal ball scene. So if her Mandarin is bad, and his English is perfect, why does she speak her poor Mandarin to him on the phone?! It was so bad I didn't understand ONE word she said. <br/><br/>People who hated the film can point out a lot more plot holes besides this one. There are so many contradictions - the filmmakers really didn't have their head on straight. <br/><br/>In the short story, the daughter died of a rock climbing accident at age 25. But in the film, she died of cancer/leukemia as a young teen. It really would've been more interesting if they stuck with the short story on this one. <br/><br/>The love interest in the short story was named Gary, but in the film, they changed his name to Ian. I guess Gary doesn't sound sexy for a love interest these days. The story was written in 1998, and I'm not sure Gary even sounded sexy back then. But I don't think Chiang meant for him be sexy - he's a theoretical physicist, for heaven's sake. But in a film, you need cool, attractive characters, so Ian it is. Jeremy Renner might be considered attractive in an odd way, but he lacks charisma & presence. He seems really boring. <br/><br/>Adams looks young for 42, thanks to celebs' constant use of Botox. She has an enviable nose job that gives her a perfect front and profile view. I think she got the same plastic surgeon as Jennifer Connelly because they have very similar slim, pointy, perfect noses. Adams only rose to fame after her successful plastic surgery - like so many other actresses, e.g., Catherine Zeta-Jones, Nicole Kidman. No one looks this perfect without going under the knife!"
"jrarichards","6","2","11","17 November 2016"," At-times innovative take on a ""first contact"" ... but not as subtle as it thinks it is
","As the title suggests, ""Arrival"" is sci-fi (based on a Ted Chiang book not called ""Arrival""), ostensibly about the arrival of enigmatic alien spacecraft and ensuing attempts to communicate. It is from French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, and one can sense an intense (""non-American"") desire here to prove that a subtly cerebral approach can outperform a big-bucks SFX-dominated alien movie. Given my panning of emptily-whizz-bang new ""Star Wars"" and ""Independence Day"" movies, I was ready to believe. <br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>The film starts OK with a hyper-minimalist but genuinely affecting encapsulation of reaction to the appearance of 12 alien craft around the world. This works, and is tense, impressive and fun.<br/><br/>Alas, audience doubt begins as Col. Weber (Forest Whitaker) first meets our hero - linguist Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams). Whitaker normally grabs a movie and dominates with his great abilities and presence, but here he largely fails, delivering terse (sometimes witty) Colonel-type lines that do not really need his skills. He is mainly background. Indeed, in ""Arrival"", EVERYBODY is background to Banks, including (virtually) the only other key character - astrophysicist Dr Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner).<br/><br/>The fact that our two boffins are only at doctoral level is telling. And a further sign of slapdash (reason for doubt as to quality in depth) appears as the first Banks-Weber meeting ends, and the former warns the latter against cooperation with another linguist, on the basis that the latter mistranslated a word from Sanskrit! Given a US military seeking out the greatest experts to deal with the biggest issue ever faced, we in the real world would be WAY beyond mistranslations of single words from a language in which Sir William Jones was an expert back in the 18th century!<br/><br/>And that typifies ""Arrival"". Superficially, it's straining its sinews to be clever and nuanced, but it just isn't, because ""defence in depth"" is lacking.<br/><br/>If a film eschews big-bucks effects for intellect, then brain there needs to be. Here the story focuses down to the team making linguistic contact - leaving some viewers secretly longing to see the growing fear and chaos which ""Arrival"" summarises through TV news feeds, as well as (just) one aerial shot implying that millions have dropped everything to drive to Montana for a peep.<br/><br/>The focusing in goes so far in fact that only Banks matters, with other support characters - even Donnelly - in the shade. This is amazing in a two-hour film, but also cheap and actually unsubtle, and one-dimensional. Nothing of the kind could be said of that (early) special-effects-fest ""Close Encounters"", which remains impressive and extremely moving, including - indeed especially - for scientists. If you push beyond the first Richard Dreyfuss-type story, ""Close Encounters"" has layer after layer of realistic-looking scientific approach to the events portrayed. Under Spielberg, people who look like a genuine team of experts from every field are shown as well-prepared, doing things real experts would do. Everybody has a task, and performs said task faithfully and tellingly - whether centre-stage or in the wings.<br/><br/>In ""Arrival"", the minutes pass, and yet the support team remain unknown and mainly stereotypical, and (mostly) seem to be doing irrational things, or nothing at all!<br/><br/>As ""Close Encounters"" shows, the very idea that aliens would choose Earth, and make it here FUNDAMENTALLY undermines the non-communication plot. They would have monitored our broadcasts, and gone online on closer arrival. Inability to speak would not prevent understanding. In Spielberg's magnum opus, hand signals, music and a simple form of mind control helped. In ""Arrival"" in contrast, the aliens' fiendishly complicated language has to be decoded by Banks, and this marks a high-point of the film ... for those accepting the need for translation. But these aliens also turn out to have mind control, so why all the messing about? <br/><br/>It's just not logical...<br/><br/>On the plus side, Banks's insight into the culture and motivations of the heptapod aliens is cleverer stuff. But it's her solo effort that has got us there, and that is not realistic.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film ends with its audience gaining adequate insight into various things that have gone before, with the character of Gen. Shang coming to the fore. Like ""2012"" (an effects-rich film, certainly, but also self-believing and pretty cohesive), ""Arrival"" reminds us that cooperation with China is make or break now, and that's interesting, Indeed, when Shang emerges from the background, we have a VERY powerful (if so-brief) contribution from Tzi Ma to enjoy. <br/><br/>The (very) ending here has some clout, and is moving, given that it also addresses the family circumstances of the main character(s). This IS the subtle part tacked on to several hours of less-than-adequate alien stuff. But can that really be justified? <br/><br/>Indeed, if the family-oriented ending is moving, the rest of ""Arrival"" is mainly emotion-free, and certainly joyless, unlike ""Close Encounters"" or ""Star Trek: First Contact"". There is tension/fear, puzzlement and (occasionally) mission, but no real hint at the wonder of what is happening, right up there with the risk. This is a flawed lack of realism, given that devoted exobiologists and others would do the job, but also find it supremely meaningful.<br/><br/>With its strongish ending and an at-moments interesting work on efforts to understand a language, ""Arrival"" is not without pluses; but it could have done better. What is more, ""Star Trek"" and even ""Dr Who"" have dealt regularly with communication issues/barriers vis-a-vis aliens, and these short-episode shows HAVE managed to pose more interesting questions, and achieve loftier intellectual heights, than ""Arrival"", for all its pretensions. That should raise an alarm for both those who want to be subtle in sci-fi and those who want to dazzle us with effects. There is ALREADY a successful middle-course out there. People have ALREADY combined intellect and spectacle in alien-focused sci-fi - even back in the 70s.<br/><br/>Can today's film makers not match that?"

","I saw ""Arrival"", starring Amy Adams-Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice, American Hustle; Jeremy Renner-Hawkeye in the Avengers movies, American Hustle; Forest Whitaker-Taken 3, Panic Room and Tzi Ma-Million Dollar Arm, 24_tv.<br/><br/>This is an alien invasion movie for the crowd that is tired of all those action packed blockbusters. There is very little action here. It's more along the lines of a mental exercise. It's based on a book by Ted Chiang called 'The Story of Your Life' and the movie starts with Amy talking about her daughter's life-from when she was a baby until she became an adult. Amy is a linguistics professor-she can work languages like a puzzle and get to the true meaning of dialects better than anyone. All of a sudden, 12 alien looking objects appear all over the world, just hovering about 20 feet off the ground. Forest, dressed in a military uniform, shows up on Amy's door step, saying they need her help in establishing communications with the aliens. He takes her to the closest one in Montana where Jeremy is waiting-he is a mathematician on the team. Their mission is to find out if the aliens are friendly or just looking for something to barbecue for the weekend. The military are in contact with the other countries where the other 11 objects are located but no one will swap information with each other-each is afraid to give someone else an advantage over themselves. Tzi plays the head of China and he is ready to start attacking the aliens at any moment so there is a time limit going on. It's not a bad movie, just not action packed. Example; I remember one explosion and no one even got hurt-I think they just put it in to make people think the action was about to really get cranking...but, nope, that was it. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It would be alright as a rental, if you are not into action-Like I am."
"dave-mcclain","5","2","11","11 November 2016"," ""Arrival"" brings us a creative, but dull and inconsequential story.
","When a movie is such that its genre is difficult to nail down, the combination of words used to describe what kind of movie it is are significant. There is a difference between a crime drama and a crime thriller, and between an action fantasy and an adventure fantasy, and between a horror thriller and just plain horror. The difference is usually a matter of focus and emphasis. So, when you go on IMDb.com and see ""Arrival"" (PG-13, 1:56) categorized as ""Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"", you can be sure that distinguishes it from, say, the ""Star Trek"" films, most of which are listed as ""Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"". ""Arrival"" is one of those movies that's hard to pigeon-hole. If it helps, I'll tell you that I see this film as 20% ""Independence Day"", 50% ""Contact"", 10% ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and about 20% other movies which I can't mention in this review without spoiling the movie's twists and reveals even if they are kind of predictable.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" centers around Dr. Louise Banks (multiple Oscar nominee Amy Adams), a brilliant linguistics professor at an unnamed university. The film opens with a montage of Louise as a single mother raising an intelligent and creative daughter who ends up tragically taken by an unnamed disease before reaching adulthood (not a spoiler, because this all happens in the film's first five minutes and is used mainly as character development). These scenes show Louise to be a doting mother, who is devastated by her daughter's premature death and has an understandably difficult time getting on with her life.<br/><br/>When 12 huge objects which look like filled-in canoes arrive from outer space and park themselves vertically just above the surface of the earth in seemingly random and mostly remote locations all around the globe, people panic, riot and wonder. These things are just sitting there, not doing anything. The militaries which protect the countries where these objects are hovering discover that every 18 hours, a door opens at the bottom of each space ship, allowing humans to enter and attempt to communicate with the 7-legged, octopus-like beings which ""speak"" in seemingly random sounds.<br/><br/>Army Colonel Weber (Oscar winner Forest Whitaker), who is in charge of the site around a ship floating over the state of Montana, comes to the office of Dr. Banks (who had previously done some translation for the military and still holds a Top Secret clearance) to enlist her help. Louis is paired with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (multiple Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner) and, within hours, the two of them are accompanying Col. Weber and several military technicians into the Montana ship every ¾ of a day, interacting with two large septapods (as they label them) floating in a cloud behind a transparent wall.<br/><br/>The process of communication goes frustratingly slowly. After Louis and Ian decide to remove their protective suits (so the aliens can better ""see"" them), the septapods begin communicating by spraying onto the barrier an ink-like substance that forms circles with different combinations and configurations of bumps and swirls on the outside of each. Louise and Ian painstakingly figure out the meaning of these circles and how to use the heptapods' written language to find out why they came to earth. Meanwhile, U.S. military and political leaders, whose concerns are voiced by an on-site C.I.A. representative, Agent Halpern (Michael Stuhlbarg), are growing impatient, while international military officers, following the lead of China's General Shang (Tzi Ma), are pushing for decisive action.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" offers up an original and very human, but rather dull sci-fi story. It's more intellectual than action-packed in nature and doesn't need battle scenes or imminent threats to the survival of mankind to make its point, but it could've used a more engaging plot. The movie ends up being not much more than a 2-hour sermon about embracing life with all of its ups and downs, which isn't enough to justify the film's long, slow build. Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer (adapting Ted Chiang's multiple award-winning 1998 novella ""Story of Your Life"") arrive at the moral of the story in a way that's creative and memorable (and the cast is outstanding), but the journey is too tedious. ""B-"""
"tsafwah","10","2","12","6 March 2017"," Yes, language is a science too!
","My perspective on this movie is that it is more humanistic than it is about aliens. Yes, the subject is the aliens coming to the earth and we want to try to configure why they come here. What are their purposes? What can we deal with them? How can they understand us and most importantly, how can we understand them.<br/><br/>But... that's not the focal point here. It is more about humanity. Our values and how can we act when things pressure us. We always fear of the unknown, we defense first before we get to open, we rather fight first than we want to communicate to each other. The different nations that take different course of actions toward the 'alien invasion' really speak to how we live in this world. Most people like the easy way to deal with things but not everyone dares to take the highest roads/risks.<br/><br/>Amy Adams performs her character so divine. I don't think other actress can replace her character here as Dr. Louise Banks. The way she struggles with her health due to brain 'rewiring' and episodic memories that seems to be so real that she tries hard to maintain her ground.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movies that you'll discuss for hours or maybe for years. Everyone has their own interpretation on this. But my interpretation is that the alien come just to give clue that they may need help from human in 3000 years later. Dr. Banks asked ""How would you know about the future?"" and the Hannah, the child character, is the child that she'll have in the future as she asked to the alien ""Who is this child?"" and later she knows that she and Ian is the parent to the child. Basically, the alien invasion event is the start of Louise and Ian and their child soon to be dead, Hannah. And she knows this from her communication with the alien. Then at the end of the movie, the aliens around the world just vanished, now they get their message across and understood by one human named Dr. Louise Banks. Later all humanity will understand this, yes, it'll takes just one person that can change the world.<br/><br/>Now, I must say that the writers of this movie, Eric Heisserer and Ted Chiang, are sheer brilliance! This movie is just stunning at its film making, the camera works, the sounds, and everything is just bona fide EXCELLENT to me!"

","Amazing movie, very intriguing and interesting throughout. very powerful and moving. beautifully shot.. great directing (2 viewings)<br/><br/>
SPOILERS<br/><br/>
i was worried this movie would have a vague abstract ending open to interpretation. when they started showing the play dough alien and her teaching the language i started getting so confused, wondering if it was time travel and she was affecting the past. then, in one climactic moment, the reveal. i went from not know wth was going on to understanding everything perfectly. the twist brought me to tears from how awesome it was. everything made sense at that moment. and it was a more perfect and satisfying conclusion than anything i would have come up with. and as with all great twists, they tell you the twist early in the movie, when they said something like ""i thought this was the beginning, but they see time differently than us""<br/><br/>this movie also has a lot you can discuss afterwards. like the reason she got divorced (presumably because she told him their daughter would die and he was upset that she didn't tell him beforehand because he wouldn't have gone through with it). and the concept that the language is circular, and it doesn't matter if you read it forwards or backwards. that parallels her ability to now see time differently, not linearly. it also relates to the daughter's name being a palindrome. hannahannahannah.<br/><br/>She got married and had a baby knowing she would get divorced and lose the baby. I think that's the difference with seeing time all at once instead of linearly. The way we see time we would be sad at every moment after she died. The way the aliens look at time they see all of time at once so they always see that she died, but at the same time they always see every moment while she was alive and loved each other. That's kind of like when people say I wouldn't have changed anything because I cherish the time we had together. Some people can handle it well, other people would rather not even deal with it if they could avoid the pain that comes after. But I think if we could remember everything equally instead of just remembering mostly the last thing that happened , it would change our mind"

"zester3","6","1","4","8 February 2018"," Not for some...
","Well, it's only a film, let's face it. And does it really matter? I suppose at the end of the day it doesn't.<br/><br/>If anyone is actually interested in this from a sci-fi point of view what I'm going to say will be a spoiler. Actually, that's the interesting rub. It doesn't matter because this film is so opaque that knowing what it's about before you start is the only way you're going to understand it. So I'm doing you a favour.<br/><br/>If as I did, you just start watching it (I knew vaguely it was about aliens arriving, language, etc etc, but not much more than that) then you're going to be thoroughly confused, disappointed, and in the end cynical.<br/><br/>I jest not. I'm not completely foolish and I want a film to succeed and be good - obviously, if even for my own sake - but I couldn't help starting to laugh and make comments to myself. It had that effect. Which is a very bad sign.<br/><br/>I don't know if all the people who've raved about this film knew the premise of it before they started or not. If you know that the first scene isn't present day but technically the future you might feel better. But you don't. Or I didn 't.<br/><br/>If the idea of the film is to severely challenge our ideas of linear time then it succeeds, no question. That is its forte, and very well it does it. However, if as a human being, you want to feel human and enjoy the film then you need to connect with the characters. All great films and stories have done this. They draw you into their characters' lives, you begin to know them, and to know them is to love them.<br/><br/>But here, there's no backstory. I have no idea who the woman was. I have/had no idea who the man was. I do know that the chemistry between them was non-existent. You will realise the absurdity of this when you see it. On the other hand it might have been the whole point, but that doesn't make for a good film.<br/><br/>There's also the usual predictable Hollywood idea of visiting aliens to be confronted by the stupid military who only want to shoot things because they're frightened and ignorant. Like those isolated tribes in the jungle who won't let you near them and fire bows and arrows at helicopters and strangers. For some reason we're always portrayed as ignorant, frightened savages and aliens as the enemy, a threat, to be approached with both hands on a hair trigger.<br/><br/>Of course, the hero of the day is always the one with a tad more guts and initiative who actually behaves normally and goes to see what's happening instead of cowering behind a tank. Well, obviously. But I digress.<br/><br/>So, if you're prepared for the usual stupid 'Let's just shoot them' attitude from the military, a very, very vague meeting and contact with strange creatures from somewhere else, your sense of reality to be jiggered about to the point of invoking sarcastic comments, and no human feeling whatsoever from or between the characters (except maybe mother and daughter but it doesn't last), then you'll love it.<br/><br/>Personally I wanted very much to enjoy it. I like my sci-fi films; I like that kind of thing and I'm good at scientific/philosophical ideas (Interstellar was no problem) but I couldn't. In fact I was driven to sarcasm, and that's a very bad sign.<br/><br/>But the film's had awards, a 94% rating on one movie board, critics eulogising over it, so maybe they knew something I didn't. I know I spent the whole film in a warp trying to connect with the characters and not succeeding because there was nothing to connect with.<br/><br/>As for language and/or linguistics, forget it. The author's a Chinese American. I have a feeling that the real underlying motive is about a Chinese person feeling like an discombobulated alien in America whose people don't understand language character-symbols and we're all having communication troubles. Build on that the old, worn cliche about humanity having to be saved from itself then you've got it. But only badly and vaguely because even that is not an act of mercy, it's a trade-off, an investment in an unseen future. (When the future is convenient to the story it really is the future, otherwise it's all mixed up).<br/><br/>What's wrong with this whole thing is there's no love in it, therefore there's no real film experience. At least ET and Close Encounters made you cry a bit. At least you were rooting for the guys in Interstellar. The same thing with Gravity, awful though it was. Here, the only star interest is some extremely cerebral, and therefore disconnected, idea of time distortion - and, frankly, who cares. But at least it's got me talking about it. But probably only because it's mysterious. Which might be a polite word for confusing.<br/><br/>So, if you're going to see it, be aware that it doesn't start in the nice sensible present like a proper story, you're watching the future, except they don't tell you that. Just bear in mind that events as they unfold may not be linear and you might, just might, get through it without laughing. Maybe.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, or fortunately, there is a serious element to it too because time may not be very linear depending on your mindset... but we better not get into that."

","Not understanding the high marks for a boring, nonsensical film.<br/><br/>Other than the US military paying little attention to this Arrival, it appears the creators of this film paid little attention to other science fiction films in the same genre.<br/><br/>My wife and I both watched it, without any idea of what it was about. We both came to the same conclusion: ""What was that?"""
"mposey-64393","3","1","4","14 November 2017"," Because nothing says ""TIME TRAVEL"" like heavy-handed politics and children dying of Space Cancer!
","You should not watch Arrival, because everything you need to know about the movie is right on the cover: Amy Adams staring solemnly into the distance, while Jeremy Renner gazes longingly. Oh yeah there's aliens that apparently deserve better placement than the black guy from Battleship Earth (arguably a better alien in that movie than the Cthulhu Heptapod things were in this one.) <br/><br/>What makes this movie terrible, and not just able to be avoided unless you need some background noise for Netflix and Chill, is that your primal lizard brain really wants to like it. The visuals are on fleek, and the score is one of those maudlin pastoral dirges that make you want to go to bed and die. Speaking of dying, Amy Adams' kid dies. That's not a spoiler because that's literally how the movie opens. Just throws it right out there on the Thanksgiving dinner table. It's gonna be a real depressing 2 hours, and don't you regret not clicking on the Avengers instead because, of course, now SHE wants to see what happens since dying children are like glue traps for millennial chicks and you're too invested at this point.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the synopsis, there are these aliens that come to earth in twelve of those old native American grind stones that you had to smash corn with when your 6th grade class visited that pioneer village, and they speak only in coffee stains. Swear to God you're going to watch it not believing me and then go, ""Oh damn, he wasn't kidding like when he said Eleven dies in Stranger Things 2."" Evidently these coffee stains allow you to see the future ONLY IF YOU ARE AMY ADAMS despite the fact that Jeremy Renner did just as much work and actually cracked the fact that the only way to save the world was to embrace this clumsy allegory for Globalism. Where's your pay gap now, ladies?<br/><br/>So Amy and Jeremy try to stop Forrest Whitaker from blowing up the grindstone squids despite the fact that one of the Heptapods says something in Caffeinese translates to ""Use Weapon"" and that's usually the time the aliens should have actually stepped back and thought, ""Oh hell, that was probably a really stupid thing to choose as our first words to a militarily developed native race in whose yard we happen to be parked illegally."" She eventually steals a phone and tells THE ONLY MILITARY GENERAL IN CHINA EVIDENTLY what his wife said right before she died and as they say in China, ""If you can remember what my wife told me on her death bed, then I have to call off my alien war."" So he tells future Amy Adams his personal phone number knowing that present day Amy Adams would then know it because when red headed white girls bust out fluent Mandarin, you suddenly learn everything about FTL Time Travel (which this claimed to be but absolutely wasn't).<br/><br/>Oh yeah, also also Amy Adams keeps going back and forth in time every time she reads what the aliens are saying like she's having photosensitive time-seizures. It's not confusing however, just remember that every time you see her with her kid, that part of the movie is completely vestigial to the main story and cutting it out would actually make everyone feel better.<br/><br/>So the aliens take Amy Adams up into their ship, and basically lay out the whole plot of the movie in subtitles because the director of this movie spent way too much time reminding everyone who watches this movie that humans are flawed, and are capable of getting sick and dying at a young age. Oh yeah, and she goes from knowing about 4 words in Coffee stain/Caffeinese/whatever to being able to carry on entire existential discussions with aliens capable of INTERPLANAR TRAVEL yet know dick about grammar and conjugation, and talk like they came from super advanced albeit somehow still REALLY into Frank Lloyd Wright squid world on a J1 Study Visa. Whole thing is just silly.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and instead of deciding not to have a child so as to prevent it from suffering a horrible death, and just explain it to Jeremy Renner who will believe her because she just made the aliens go away and those people probably would know stuff like that, she voice-overs this whole thing about embracing the inevitable because as soon as Jeremy Renner admits that he loves her he also leans in and Whispers Joe Biden-style, ""I want to put a baby in you"", or ""let's make a baby,"" or something super appropriate for a pre-first date phase of courtship. <br/><br/>And then it literally ends. And you're trying to conceal the genuine fury that Hollywood had the nerve to put a SCI-FI label on a Nicholas Sparks story. What did the aliens eat? What forms of government did they have on squid world? Why did they talk in coffee circles? what was the magic intelligent ink that they used to talk made of? can you send me the PDF on how to learn that language so I can (trigger warning) Trump my friends who brag about knowing Tolkien Elvish. These are the questions that should at least be teased with the hint of an answer if you're going to qualify as a legit science fiction film. <br/><br/>But no. All we learned about the aliens is they really like to see Amy Adams cry."

","So glad I rented this from Netflix instead of paying who knows what to see it in the theater. I'm really not sure what all the fuss was about. I gave it a three only because Amy Adams did a fantastic job and the cinematography was great. The movie was slow as molasses. I don't always have to see a fast paced movie, but if you are going to have one as slow as this, please tell me a compelling story. Jeremy Renner was totally wasted in this movie, he didn't do anything. Forest Whitaker was just mad all the time and the rest of the cast was basically non-existent. Amy Adams plays a linguist who is called upon to try to decipher what the aliens are saying. Forest Whitaker's character acted like deciphering a new language should be like learning to count to 10. All he did was say hurry up and we can't do that. Jeremy Renner, the scientist on the project was just window dressing as far as I could see. He didn't have any meaningful lines or input into the movie. Amy Adams carried the story and the emotion. She is the only reason I actually sat through the entire movie. In the end there is twist. They tried to make it like the twist in the Sixth Sense, but Denis Villeneuve's direction is so scattered and subtle that it falls short. My husband actually missed it and he loves these kind of movies - being a HUGE fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey."
"Ziya90","4","1","4","30 September 2017"," It is not an academic essay or an important scientific research, it is just a flat sci-fi drama
","Arrival is a flat, stagnant and pretty uninspiring sci-fi drama with clichés throughout. If you are a science fiction fan or having an interest in alien invasion movies, it is a little possibility that you will be pleased and satisfied, because this film is not about aliens or the world society's reactions after the possibility of an alien invasion. It is more about communication, language barrier, linguistics etc. but it fails to deliver its messages and themes because of several flaws. All those posters and trailers evoke a mystery, suspense and little action, but the film's point is pretty different. We have a main character who is a go-getter type of a woman, she is talented, determined, an alpha female which is another cliché, but that's OK. Cliché casting choices? Never mind. Her character has also a sad background which is an emotional exploitation of the audience! The movie asks some important questions about life, death, future and past, our destiny and the words we speak, but it focuses on a few characters and doesn't care about the rest. The real flaw of this film is that the story becomes too personal after a while which is another famous cliché and unavoidable fate of blockbuster movies: the chosen one! I have a problem with the aliens in this movie. The envisagement of them is uninspiring. They look like giant octopuses and sometimes they feel like they are pets. I call this Transformers syndrome, because since the creators of these creatures are humans, they think like a human which causes a creativity problem in this movies such as a robot with beard and cigar or an octopus-like alien etc. The film also deals with Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, but this is not a comprehensive academic essay, a documentary or an important scientific study on linguistics, this is just a sci-fi drama, that's why I believe that it is overrated. Arrival has some statements about war and peace, unity and solidarity, but it is not effective and it drops a few plot holes into the story. The editing of the movie is smart, honestly brilliant, but no more than that. Arrival is not a thought-provoking or a very deep film, is it? These movies such as Arrival, The Fountain etc. don't reveal the secret of universe or the meaning of life. By the way, Arrival is not an action film definitely and I didn't have such an expectation. I knew that this movie wouldn't be like Independence Day, but this is not the point. The movie fails to deliver panic, chaos, suspense and paranoia well thanks to the script or low budget, I have no idea about that."

","May contain inadvertent plot spoilers for some people.<br/><br/>The aliens arrive on the planet in 12 places having to do with Sheena Easton songs...or not. Louise (Amy Adams) is a linguistics expert who somehow still has a Top Secret security clearance after 2 years (normally gone after 30 days). She is taken to the alien vessel to communicate with them, which is a struggle. There are 12 landing sites in all and everyone is attempting to talk to the aliens. The aliens are heptapods and communicate with rings that look like ink blots. Louise has flash backs of her deceased child...or wait...is it? Yes, not to give away the formula, but a linguistic saves the planet. I understand the confusion people get from the film because it utilizes the idea time is not linear in the final explanation and not too clearly. Now how the heptapods were able to perform the metallurgy needed to construct vessels capable of space travel without opposing thumbs is beyond me. Yes the film raised my geek endorphins to a new high and then I realized...(criticism) First off I don't think the DOW can lose 2,000 points in one day. They would shut down trading before that. I liked the level A suits for meeting aliens and the fact they had people dressed in protective gear to help don and doff them....but they shouldn't need the gear to help them on with the suits, just off. They should typically be dressed 1 level lower in protection to do doffing meaning level B suits. They were not. Again they confused radiation and contamination royally. An EPD and/or TLD should have been worn if that was the case, that way you don't do a blood test which can only detect levels beyond your legal limit. Canaries check for carbon monoxide levels not radiation levels and we have machines better equipped to do that. It made for a good visual, and if you are going to go all geek with circular sentences and non-linear time, take a minute to get remedial knowledge on radiation and contamination...my pet peeves with so called sci-fi films. Interesting film, but flawed.<br/><br/>Guide: 1 f-word. No sex or nudity."
"pixlreality","7","1","4","15 August 2017"," A great movie....with some flaws!
","The initial impression this gave me when I was done watching was, ""wow, that was great!."" But it soon digressed to the flaws that this film has.<br/><br/>To start with the good. This movie has AMAZING cinematography. Everything from the CGI, to the grass is beautifully directed. Every scene is well recorded and it all shows a great picture that is pure eye candy, and that's a good thing. The nature of the aliens is very mysterious and leaves you wondering about what else could have happened. I was wondering the entire time if the aliens were actually hostile, but they in turn show something a bit more beautiful. I love the message that this movie portrays, as it try's to show the audience that, in a situation like this, we would need to work together to solve a problem like this. This movie shows that, instead of waging war with each other, or better yet, aliens from a different place. Why not join together and learn more about one another.<br/><br/>The faults with this movie are apparent, but need to be addressed. Firstly; why don't they explain MORE about the aliens origins. I understand that the movie wants the aliens to be shrouded in mystery, but I never really learn much about them other than they use some sort of plasma-like ink to communicate, as well as the deep undulating sounds that they emit. The one part that makes this movie lose a few points is the part when the lot of soldiers put a bomb inside the UFO. This was a tragic mistake by the directors. For one, the movie never explains what the UFO was made out of, and IF a bomb of that size could even trigger a small dent in the craft. Another thing I didn't quite understand was the flashbacks. How and why did they happen. The movie starts showing our main character hallucinating and even lucid dreaming. But they never explain the correlations that she had with the aliens. It was almost like she was connected with the aliens, but the movie never explains why she was chosen to be the one to do what she did.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie was great. It does have a flaws, but conveys a great message. To all the people who give this movie a one star, they simply do not understand the hidden message that this movie has. It's not all about action everyone. Sometimes movies that are smart with what they do (in this case), will work wonders. And in the end, it IS a Si-Fi movie. Movies aren't perfect."
"Sam-953-169285","4","1","4","1 August 2017"," Scientifically deficient
","The acting is wonderful, Amy Adams is a joy. At least the writing gives her the material to use in that way.<br/><br/>If you are the type of person that is irritated by scientifically deficient stories then you will be disappointed by this. I don't know if the linguistics are believable but .... well actually when you get to the end you will think, what? The premise of the linguistic style really does not make sense. The premise jumps from linguistics to something else entirely.<br/><br/>You would think that if aliens journeyed to Earth and made an appearance with so much organization and preparation then they would be prepared to assist in establishing communication. In other science fiction stories, aliens study our TV shows and learn how to communicate. You would think these aliens would do something like that and/or be better prepared to communicate. They would have equipment, such as televisions, or something that would make it more convenient to communicate; just the physical communication at least. Instead this movie makes the aliens look so incapable of so much.<br/><br/>In real life, the countries of the world would work together better than in this movie. NASA of the United States of America has discussed the problem of communicating with aliens. There will be many experts working together to solve a problem such as in this movie if it ever exists in real life, it would not be just one person.<br/><br/>Some movies are wound quite tightly in the sense that you can't fast-forward over much of them (I often however fast-forward over chase scenes and such) but much of this movie can be fast-forwarded over."
"justkrepper","9","1","4","20 July 2017"," In a future not so far away
","Arrival is a poignant film with a rather simple and refined visual aspect, whether it is in the design of the extraterrestrials creatures (which makes by the way more credible), that of their ship (called ""shell"" in the film) or in the creation of sets.<br/><br/>I had the pleasant impression of a film which, for once, took the time to explain as clearly as possible the phenomena and actions that were taking place on the screen. Some scenes appear like deep breaths that leave space for reflection, both for the characters and for us spectators. In a sense I was even able to immerse myself little by little in the life of the heroine until fully sharing her feelings and her ambitions. I would also like to mention the correctness with which Amy Adams embodies the protagonist, which gives even more intensity to the situation. We follow with avidity the process of interpreting the language used by of the apparent alien visitors (Xenolinguistics), and subsequently of the powers that this generates when this language is mastered (for Louise Banks the possibility to know the future)<br/><br/>A small default that would explain the note I attributed to this film (09/10) would be the lightness of certain dialogues that created a lag in relation to the tone and general atmosphere of the film. I speak mainly of some conversations between Louise and Ian punctuated by typical phrases, straight out of a romance novel. They contrast too much with the gravity of the situation, for we are still talking about the discovery (then taken as an invasion for some) of an inhuman kind. <br/><br/>If this film has taught me something, it is that an event like this would cause our loss, the disappearance of the human species. Indeed, we would be unable to agree between citizens and heads of state, except that this time there will not be Louise to allow us to perceive the future and thus save humanity (although we can always believe it)<br/><br/>Arrival explores a new side of the science fiction genre, which is proving to be very interesting and deeper."
"BeneCumb","6","1","4","15 June 2017"," A been-there-seen-that movie with substantial flaws
","This decade has made happen dozens of sci-fi movies with activities in a limited space and time, with slow pace and lengthy speculations about mankind's present and future. On the usual line, I am not into similar productions, but the reputation of the movie and it awards ""urged"" us in a group to pick the one in question. <br/><br/>We all watched the movie in full, but all of us had several misunderstandings and indistinct places solved only afterwards, when reading about its plot... Vague flashbacks, strange behavior of characters in clear situations, and settlements based on Western approaches made this a topsy-turvy watch, with trivial ending and naive conclusions. And as a linguist, I know that one is unable to figure out a totally different language/pictograph in a way we see in this movie. Bringing the Western wishful thinking into the minds of non-human aliens may flatter some part of respective audience, but it is neither scientific nor logical approach... And if the basics is totally odd, then the following events do not make any good sense, particularly when bearing in mind a sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>Therefore, for me, Arrival is above mediocrity due to the direction and leading performances only (Amy Adams as Louise Banks and Forest Whitaker as Colonel Weber, above all). The overall concept is unreasoned and necessitates to refer to its plot description later on for some of its angles and ideas."

","I kept waiting for this movie to clue me in as to where it was going, and what I should sort of expect, but it just kept dragging along, seemingly with nowhere to go.

This is one movie I sat through and left thinking, ""well, that was 2+ hours of my life I'll never get back."" This is certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen, but the chances of me wanting to see it again when it comes to cable are slim and none.

It seems many found it hard to understand and as a result, found the movie boring. I personally can't understand this, as it is in fact quite straightforward, but I won't spoil it by dissecting it in the review.

If you go into it, expecting or wanting gun battles and explosions, then you will be sorely disappointed. If you go into it, expecting a slowly paced, emotional and clever sci- fi/drama , then you will probably enjoy this great movie.

"cole11235","7","1","4","17 March 2017"," Entertaining but by no means a masterpiece
","Arrival has a very intriguing premise, great cinematography, and a performance by Amy Adams that should have garnered Oscar consideration.<br/><br/>However, it is by no means the masterpiece some are painting it to be. This is not the ""thinking man's"" philosophical movie that some ascribe it to be. The conflicts in the movie are face value and do not carry much moral weight. Yes, the movie hints at the idea of determinism, but it does not flesh this concept out whatsoever.<br/><br/>In regards to the movie itself, Arrival has a very interesting and unique premise. Through beginning the movie with that essentially happens at the end a circular progression of events is created to parallel the circular language and depiction of time that is so frequently stressed in the movie. The musical scores are quite good as are the effects and the views. From this alone, the movie is passable to sit through.<br/><br/>The greatest sin of this movie is its unfulfilled potential. The plot is not very well fleshed out. Any true conflicts within the movie are extremely base and unrealistic. The main threat is the compulsiveness of China and Russia, a common movie trope here in the states. Future threats to mankind and the alien race are alluded to but not explained. Twelve alien ships came with a ""gift"". The gift is the language the aliens speak that allows you to see time. However, this is seemingly only passed onto and fully understood by Louise, leaving a lot to be desired. Furthermore, there is no real character development for anyone besides Louise, the linguistics professor played by Amy Adams. The next closest character to gaining any substance is Ian, a physicist played by Jeremy Renner, who in the end only serves as a glorified narrator.<br/><br/>Overall, it is an entertaining movie but certainly not Villeneuve's ""mangum opus"" as some are calling it. His work with Prisoners was much more complete as a movie."

Through terminal illnesses and mathematical and linguistic conundrums it paints itself as something profound and new but in truth is lacking any originality or depth. Disappointingly there's also the usual clichéd sci-fi tropes thrown in, such as Russia and China being portrayed as insensitive and overly aggressive, the disillusioned rogue soldier who attempts to sabotage our heroes' world saving plans, shots of rioting breaking out on news channels around the globe.

"PrashunChakraborty","7","1","4","1 December 2016"," Very good but falls short of being great
","Arrival is a good film but not great. Watched it yesterday in the local movie hall and was immediately disappointed by how drab it looked, where did all the great cinematography and camera-work of the Director's previous work Sicario had gone? Rechecked the trailers and there was definitely problem with the print given to PVR, which is such a shame because this movie looked excellent in trailers and so bad in the movie hall. As far as acting is concerned everyone was decent and I think this is the first time Amy Adams has been the first lead of a movie and she brought her A game, easily career best performance. I thought the first half was quite weak, there are a lot of ""talky"" generic scenes which could have been cut, the extra effort to show the military protocol of isolation, immune system boosts, suits, etc. etc. got way more screen time than it deserved, Denis Villeneuve should have trusted his audience, we understand all the protocols, don't spend half an hour to forty five minutes explaining it to us with chitter-chatter and therein lies the biggest fault of Arrival, there are just so many scenes that a person who watches these kinds of films doesn't need, some aspects just feel a bit dumbed down. There is also one convenient, really bad story angle which just adds fifteen minutes to the runtime but was completely unnecessary. If I was the editor, this movie would have lost good half an hour if not more. BUT and this is a big BUT, the second half picks up momentum and where all the seeds the film planted start to take shape, and this is quite well done, I was impressed, the climax was truly the highlight of the film and so well done but can't be discussed without going into spoilers. The music and score is good but not as good as Sicario, and often feels forced and overused (especially in an otherwise excellent climax). All in all, despite it's rough edges, I still liked Arrival, I liked it more than the usual science fiction releases around this time of the year- Gravity, Interstellar, Martian, but this is not that great first contact film that we will be talking about for years like 2001 or Soalris, just a solid film for this year."

","After watching this movie, it really made me look life differently. It captured very beautiful moments, moments of the protagonists past/future. & Although it left me very confused at times, the story slowly let me in and answered mostly all of my questions. But there is one question that is still on my mind which is when the Alien tells Dr.Louise Banks(Amy Adams) that in about 3000 years into the future, they will need humanities help. It is very unclear what it is that they will need help with, but I really hope they come up with a sequel, possibly in the future set in the year 5016. Im not sure if the director Denis Villeneuve is steering towards that direction but it will surely draw a big crowd considering the success of this film! <br/><br/>ACTORS/CHARACTERS I just wanna point out that this is Amy Adams very best performance thus far! She was phenomenal, and as for her character I thought they nailed it on the spot. I think they certainly choose the right kind of background for her character because it's very different aside from other sci-fi films.<br/><br/>As for Jeremy Renner, he was great also, he was also the lead role in the movie HurtLocker, which was also an amazing film. His character is also very great and creates a great supporting character for the story. And honestly, the other actors were pretty solid as for acting, but there was some issues i had. One being the logic of the other characters in this movie. For example, the country leaders. They were by far the most delusional people in this movie. Lets be honest here, what can you do to an alien space craft? I doubt they can even make a scratch on UFO, come on its an Alien spaceship that is far more technical than anything we have today, so its best not to tick them off unless they show aggression... which they didn't. But, it is just a movie. <br/><br/>OVERALL Its just an amazing movie I just kind of wished it was a bit longer and had a bit more settings, but despite the little tiny problems in this movie.

Humans with all its war, ego, greed, miscommunications, short-tempers and small-mindedness. To only take in the first half of this story is proving my point, including my own shortcomings. As a matter of fact, I kept wondering how on Earth did this get nominated for Best Picture?<br/><br/>Isn't it obvious by now? Yeah, stick it through to the second half. <br/><br/>Some people I know who have seen this state they didn't understand it. Didn't catch the answer to the one question this movie pounds into our head: ""Why are they here?"" I do not follow. I don't understand, even with the complexity the second half throws at us, the mission is actually pretty clear.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is about the military attempting to communicate with an alien race of 12 ships that hover over random spots. In comes (the fantastic performance by Amy Adams who plays) Louise and Ian (the normal, expected and welcomed acting job of Jeremy Renner) who work as a linguist and scientist duo to communicate with the aliens. It's not a quick process, especially when they have to deal with different gravity, beings, barriers and, of course, languages. But the military and governments are impatient. I suspect some movie watchers are, as well.<br/><br/>Like I made evident, stick with it. It becomes clear and amazing. With as much dirt as they throw at the human race, the movie reveals itself as an eye-opener. <br/><br/>I have given too much away. My point is: watch this to the end and let the script tell you a marvelous story. <br/><br/>It's slow, unabashedly at times. Maybe a little too realistic. But, it gave me hope that my own secret sci-fi fantasies could come true. Hint: Voyager.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: It's not a movie I would watch repeatedly. In fact, I have no idea (currently, but maybe they do.) when I will see this again. That said, I am super glad I did see it and wish this could really happen. We need this. WE REALLY DO."

Based on Ted Chiang's story ""Story of Your Life"" the script by Eric Heisserer explores some very meta ideas (""What is your purpose on Earth?"" to begin with) while director Denis Villeneuve balances the near documentary-like aesthetic employed thru out.

"tobias-hollinetz","8","2","13","9 December 2016"," A very creative idea about the first-contact scenario, with an intelligent plot and Oscar-worthy performances.
","Minor Spoilers!<br/><br/>Arrival is a film about the first contact with aliens, which is a very often used topic in the science fiction genre. So the question is: Is ""Arrival"" able to deliver something different and do I recommend the film? I will tell you below.<br/><br/>What ""Arrival"" does different is the whole plot, there's no ""They've come to kill us!"" or ""We have to destroy them"", I think this is the first film about this topic without villainous aliens. In fact, it shows what I think would happen: Humanity attacking first. <br/><br/>The plot never felt to strange and did not leave the feeling of a rush or unexplained moments, except for one point I mentioned below, it has a nice pacing and flow through the film. The only two things which bothered me were: 1) There weren't any politicians shown, just the military, I don't believe that not a single president is interested in the matter. 2) The translating process started off nicely, but it then felt a bit rushed with not enough explanation.<br/><br/>This is no film for everybody and if you expect a blockbuster like explosion-orgy you are wrong here. But for everybody else who likes slow crafted, intelligent, different films which want to point something out and support a non-destructible way, this is a film for you.<br/><br/>The performances overall were excellent, Amy Adams manages to deliver the situation of the linguist in a very emotional, but believable way, it felt very natural and nothing over the top. Jeremy Renner was a very charismatic scientist, although he has not enough on-screen time in my opinion and you never know why he really is in the team except for some plot-details.<br/><br/>For me ""Arrival"" is one of the best films, if not the best, of 2016, there's just so much done right here and I'm really looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's future work, hopefully it will be as good as this!<br/><br/>And I'm not a native speaker, so I apologize for any spelling mistakes!"

","Denis Villeneuve is aiming for a high brow, intellectually stimulating sci fi film. It had all the tropes of an alien invasion film. You might think Independence Day or The Day the Earth Stood Still or even 2001: A Space Odyssey but the director keeps his cards closely to his chest while leaving little clues here and there in the space/time continuum.<br/><br/>Twelve alien ships land around the globe. Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is the linguist expert brought in by the military in the USA to communicate with the aliens in the ship that is over Montana.<br/><br/>Physicist Dr Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) has also been recruited to find out how the spaceship has travelled through the vast reaches of space but both are really tasked to find out why they have arrived.<br/><br/>The various governments and their associated military are convinced that this is an invasion and some of them have become extremely nervous with the alien's intentions and the slow pace in understanding what is going on. Before long nations that were communicating with each other suddenly cease sharing information and throwing down ultimatums to the visitors.<br/><br/>Dr Banks makes a breakthrough and finds out that the aliens have a complex visual language but the meaning of the words are open to interpretation which is not helped by a media frenzy based on misinformation and half truths. Dr Banks is also affected by scenes of her daughter who died young through a rare disease but those memories might actually help her to deal with the aliens.<br/><br/>Even though the events depicted are on a global scale, Villeneuve keeps the human drama on a smaller more abstract level and lets the film unravel like a mystery. I guess there is something a little Christopher Nolanesque about the resolution. There is clever and eerie use of music and sounds. With the appearance of the aliens, you can understand why people are nervous. I found myself thinking back to Independence Day or the television series Torchwood: Children of Earth for sinister motives by the aliens as they were shrouded in smoke behind a glass wall."

","Last night I saw Arrival at TIFF and my mind was blown. This is by far Villeneuve's biggest film he has tackled yet with so many strong universal themes but yet also feels very emotional and intimate from the perspective of Amy Adams's character. Arrival is unlike any movie I've ever seen. It's about love, loss, tolerance, language and non-linear time, wrapped in a science fiction story about our first encounter with extraterrestrials. This movie is the best movie.<br/><br/>Louise is lecturing at a university; twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear across the planet. U.S. Army Colonel Weber asks her to join a team, with physicist Ian Donnelly, to decipher their language and find out why they have come to Earth. The team is brought to a U.S. military camp in Montana near one of the spacecraft. They call two alien which is nicknames them Abbott and Costello. Louise discovers that they have a written language of complicated circular symbols, and begins to learn the symbols that correspond to a basic vocabulary. As she becomes more proficient, she starts to see and dream vivid images of herself with her daughter. <br/><br/>When Louise is able to ask what the aliens want, they answer: ""offer weapon"". A similar translation ""use weapon"" is received by one of the other sites. Fear of a potential threat from the aliens leads other nations to close down communications on the project, and some prepare their military for attack. However, Louise thinks that the symbol interpreted as ""weapon"" might have an alternative translation, such as ""tool"" or ""technology"".<br/><br/>Rogue soldiers plant explosives in the spacecraft. Unaware, Louise and Ian re-enter to communicate with Abbott and Costello again. The aliens give them a much larger and more complex message. Abbott ejects Ian and Louise from the craft as the explosion occurs, which leaves them unconscious.<br/><br/>After Lan and Louise wake up, Ian works out that the symbols relate to the concept of time, and that it is one-twelfth of the whole ""gift""; they conclude that the aliens must want nations to cooperate.<br/><br/>Louise rushes back to the spacecraft, which sends down a shuttle to take her inside. She meets Costello, who communicates that Abbott is dying. Louise asks about her visions of a daughter, and Costello explains that she is seeing the future, revealing to her that her ""visions"" were not flashbacks but flash forwards. Costello also communicates that they have come to help humanity by sharing their language, which is the ""weapon"" or ""tool"" because it changes the mind's perception of time. The aliens know that 3000 years into the future they will need humanity's help in return. They ask her to use her ""weapon"" - her ability to see into the future.<br/><br/>Louise returns as the camp is being evacuated. Louise use her future power to know Shang's wife last words and she use to that to stop Shang's military power (China power). The planned Chinese attack is called off and the other nations resume contact with each other, as the spacecraft disappear from Earth.<br/><br/>When packing to leave the camp, Ian admits his love for Louise. They discuss life choices, and whether they would change them if they knew the future. Louise foresees that Ian will father her daughter Hannah, whose name is an intentional palindrome, and leave her after discovering that she knew their daughter would die before adulthood. Despite also seeing that Ian will leave her when she eventually reveals their daughter's future, when Ian asks her if she wants to have a baby, Louise agrees."

","I knew nothing about this film aside that involved aliens per the poster and trailer. I ended up seeing this movie for one reason (well two actually) only--the leads in the film. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are fast becoming my favorite performers of their generation. They are--surprising. Surprising in depth, surprising in how relate-able they are, surprising in how normal yet attractive they are.. and there are no disappointments here. They deliver......okay, enough with fawning over the leads.<br/><br/>So the film--if you liked (or loved) Contact, you will LOVE LOVE LOVE this film. The story was clearly something that would appeal to me--I love a good scifi film and its my favorite genre. But this movie sidesteps the flaw that tends to grate on your nerves in the film (and book) Contact---the foibles of humanity coming to the surface when faced with contact with an EBE. Its not ignored in the film, its just a minor plot point rather than the point. Which is just fine with me because the main plot is fantastic.<br/><br/>If you are into the Aliens/Prometheus version of scifi they you will probably be disappointed. No action, no scary space monsters picking off humans, no gore and no murder mayhem. In fact, after watching this film only one word seemed to capture it in my head. SMART. Its just a smart movie. The plot is really creative and I left the film feeling just like I did when I was a kid after seeing a good scifi film---I just wished that what I had just seen was really true. <br/><br/>I will be seeing this movie again--its that good."

Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and the rest of the cast are tremendous. Subtle acting and a truly unsettling soundtrack flood the atmosphere, it's almost difficult to breathe at times, I've not seen so much emotion in a film in a long time.<br/><br/>If you have a smart head on your shoulders, have experienced love, you'd be insane to not abandon what you're doing right now and watch this film."

It deals with one of the most run-of-the-mill situations that has been portrayed several times in Hollywood-'The Arrival of extra terrestrials on earth.' However this approach is like nothing we've seen before. It is above the typical idea of extinction of the human race. It has a much more radical perspective (when I say this, I refer to the way they dealt with the situation, it was very human like)<br/><br/>Each and every aspect of the movie is perfect right from the story to the acting. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner were brilliant as the leads. All the scenes were directed with a purpose that is easily understood. In each clip the audience is able to feel exactly what the director wanted to show. You are able to relate to the character's emotions and actions. <br/><br/>As for the story we see that more than it just being scientific, a philosophical outlook is also shown. The soundtrack is a great asset of the movie. It amplifies the feels of each situation for the audience. Especially in the ending, surely it'll stay in your head a while. <br/><br/>This movie is a must see. Everything you could possibly expect from it, it delivers on and does much more than that. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: The only questionable scene of the movie was the part where they show Louise teaching the language of the aliens to a class.

","Before I saw this film, I was baffled by how polarizing the user reviews were. Tens and ones, but very few in between. After seeing the film, I absolutely get it. Start by asking yourself if you enjoy the following movies. Sphere(1998). 2001: A Space Odyssey. Solaris(2002). If your answer is no to any of these, particularly those last two, do yourself a favor and watch something else. It would be insulting to call this the thinking person's movie, because I can think of a number of highly intelligent people that would not like this movie at all. It would be closer to say it is the extremely patient, thinking person's movie. The pacing reminded me of 2001, though it is not quite that slow. There is very nearly zero action in it, but a whole lot of highly thought provoking concepts that build over the course of the movie. For myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but I also understand the hate if you went and saw it, expecting something like Independence Day. In this movie, the battlefield takes place in the mind, and the heroes are the linguists and the mathematicians."

The sappy Hollywood ending, hover, took the ratings down a notch.<br/><br/>A LOT of work went into creating the unique sounds and language of the aliens.

","I'm going to focus on one aspect in my review as I feel it's the worst aspect of the movie and really lets it down; the script. It's truly awful.
It also spoils the portrayal of the characters, as statements come out of their mouths that no-one with an IQ above 90 would utter, let alone a scientist.
The military characters are all lazy stereotypes, their stupidity and impatience only there for exposition and to move the plot along. Forrest Whitaker's character at one point can't understand the difference between translating a well known human language with an alien one (also why is he trying to do a bad Bostonian accent?)
My PhD was in a project related to astrophysics and I didn't recognise any qualities in the scientists on screen with real life. Maybe it's too boring to portray scientists as they are, but I think The Martian did an OK job of it (leaving aside other issues with that movie)
There is some antagonism between the social and hard sciences in real life, but some of the exchanges between Amy Adams' and Jeremy Renners' character were excruciating. She says language is the foundation of civilisation, he contradicts and says it's science. That's just wrong and anyone with an inkling of history wouldn't make the claim that it's science as the scientific method was quite a late innovation in humanity's history.
I wanted to like this movie, but I found it truly exasperating."

"Mladen007","9","1","5","14 October 2017"," Original and true refreshment in this genre.
","Sharp and Short<br/><br/>At first, I was afraid that we are going to see something that we've already saw, only in a different way. That was the reason why it took me a few months to convince myself to watch this movie. But when I watched it, I was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>Arrival is a story which brings a new perspective of potential relation between people and creatures from outer space and that is what makes this movie unique and special. It starts when twelve mysterious spacecrafts appear around the world. Every similarity with other look alike movies ends here. Two main characters are Louise Banks, linguistics professor, and Ian Donnelly, scientist, physics specialist. They are trying to communicate with aliens in order to find out a reason for their landing. The way in which they try to do this is something we've never seen in such films. It includes mutual learning of languages. Louise and Ian tried to describe words to aliens so the aliens can show them the same words on their language. This turned out to be a very good plan. This, combined with Louise's ability to see future (which is very difficult to find out until the end), makes Arrival so special. It was a real pleasure to watch it. We were used to more or less same stories in this movie genre which almost always for the main theme have a war with aliens. Arrival brings new, original approach, which I think should be priority if similar things happen in real life. <br/><br/>I have to leave some room for praises for cinematography. Bradford Young alongside director David Villeneuve did a great job. This is not a surprise because Sicario and Prisoners, two other very good Villeneuve's movies, also have great cinematography, when Roger Deakins did excellent job. Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker were good, although there was a room for better performances. In some critical parts, they looked slightly indifferent, but we have to have in mind that their parts weren't easy, especially Amy's. Sound editing (movie won an Oscar for this category) film editing, screenplay and lots of other things deserve special praise. All of that, brought one Oscar win and several Oscar nominations. Denis Villeneuve has one more excellent movie to add to his biography.<br/><br/>Excellent!"

","This is a fairly rare movie. Firstly that it is a science fiction that puts its emphasis on the first word, science, more than fiction. Of course, it's a made up story, with some decent special effects. But the interesting part is the story, and the growing understanding the character Louise gets as she tries to communicate with an alien species.<br/><br/>First contact movies is always interesting, especially those movies that doesn't go directly to action filled war movies. It raises questions about how the aliens look, act and communicate. The last is the focal point of this movie, as the expert Lousie Banks is brought in to learn how to communicate with the mysterious aliens. Lousie makes some headway, but soon also starts to experience strange dreams and memories. Can they help her solve the problem. <br/><br/>The dual mysteries of the alien language and Louise's dreams easily caught my attention and immediately made me think, speculate and guess my own solution. The movie made me take part in the puzzle, the mark of a really good movie. Unfortunately, someone decided that some extra drama was needed and inserted an attack of some fearful soldier, and the preparation of war by humans. Too much of a cliché for my taste, and actually unnecessary to make the story captivating enough. It seems like the writer/director didn't trust the scientific mystery to be enough. But in my opinion it took away more from the story than added to it.<br/><br/>Still it is a refreshingly good movie, that activates the viewer instead of passivating them. It raises more questions than it answers, in a good way, both about the story, but also about our own perception of the universe.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Dark_Knight23","9","1","5","2 October 2017"," The Arrival we've all been waiting for
","Any film can have a story filled with drama, action, romance, and intensity, all led by its main protagonists and antagonists significant decisions. Although despite all this, the connection between that story and its audience is the factor that separates a successful film from a mediocre. Thus, the factor Denis Villeneuve's 'Arrival' most prominently possesses. It thoroughly engaged its audience through the journey of Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and her new counter partner, mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), as they attempt to communicate with the Aliens through their language in order to further understand the meaning behind their sudden arrival upon earth.<br/><br/>Arrival expressed a sense of Drama and Mystery while raising the concern of a disaster always being in potential sight. As many would agree it's unique in its own defence compared to most, if not all Alienated sci-fi flicks, especially in the current era of its sort. Cutting off of the cliché Aliens vs Humanity straight out war, it gives us a different kind of connection to the species at hand. We are never really convinced as to which side they're really on, which gives the film a style of distinct excitement. Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer did a terrific job with this masterpiece as they truly captured the absolute attention of their audience. This was most notably through answering a question that was never asked and finishing a puzzle many would assume was solved, as they're made to realize they were actually missing a piece the whole time. This strategy is used through the connection between Louise Banks and her motherhood, which gave the film a sense of suspense and intensity it would most likely not be the same without.<br/><br/>Films Pros:<br/><br/>-Superb direction by Denis Villeneuve as he brings his unique artistic imagination to the screen, creating the sense of dramatic intensity and puzzlement that turned the film into the stunning visual success it became.<br/><br/>-Spot on Cinematography from Bradford Young as the shady and gloomy image he created set the perfect tone and rhythm for the film, almost flawlessly from start to finish. In the end earning him an undeniably well-deserved Oscar nomination for his efforts.<br/><br/>-Amazing score from Jóhann Jóhannsson. The Icelandic composer flawlessly complemented each scene that he filled with his glorious soundtrack, as it helped express the films tone upon the setting and circumstance its characters were confronting, whilst setting the current state of emotion for viewers, unquestionably touching many of them as well.<br/><br/>-Captivating performance from Amy Adams as per usual, also strongly followed by her peers, most notably from Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker.<br/><br/>-Stunning visual effects as the Heptapods distinctive structure along with their egg-shaped alien craft were brought to life in an exquisite fashion.<br/><br/>-And last but not least, Eric Heisserer's adaptation of Ted Chiang's original novel 'Story of my life' was structured phenomenally. Most significantly when it transitioned from the present moment into quick flashes of memory, which was what I personally thought was a grand achievement in itself.<br/><br/>Films Con/s:<br/><br/>-The process of formulating the aliens language could had been visually betrayed in more of a first person manner, as at times it definitely seemed very rushed, leaving viewers in slight wonder as to whether the translation process is really that hard.<br/><br/>From all of this, Arrival's boundless outcome was clearly obvious as it pays homage to the alien genre without even getting caught up in many clichés, proving its uniqueness. Its gloomy and exciting mystery gives fans the inside look and dramatic sci-fi experience like never before, displaying the limits that a visual sci-fi masterpiece should take in order to become successful.<br/><br/>My personal rating: 8.7/10"

","Hollywood is in a strange state. The movies can't be more successful, with giant film franchises like cinematic universe. Yet somehow, a lot of people are getting bored of them due to being repetitive. Thankfully, directors like Dennis Villeneuve change this course with his bold, innovative films that challenge the viewers. And arrival is one of them. <br/><br/>Amy Adams stars as Louise Banks, a doctor in linguistics tasked with communicating with the aliens that have landed on earth. There is no explosions, no action sequences or portal in the skies to solve the issue, but instead they try to deal with interacting and understanding each other. As Louise crypts more of the aliens' language, she learns more not only from the cultural side, but finds a spiritual state in her self. The strength of the film lies in how the people react to this arrival of aliens. The social media and news of course spreads fear and paranoia across the globe, resulting in leaders, while having good intentions, take the wrong decisions. <br/><br/>The way Villeneuve executes the communication between Dr. Louise and the aliens is mesmerizing. Its atmospheric, other worldly and exotic. And it shows through the mind and talent of an auteur who knows what is he doing. He knows how to deliver an engaging style that helps the film. His psychological emphasis on the subject matter makes a movie unique unlike any other. <br/><br/>From a film making standpoint, this movie is a masterpiece. The direction that gives a moody feeling, and beautiful spectrum, is one of the biggest strengths of the movie. The way the conversation is shot and orchestrated is something to behold. Villeneuve created a sci film that feels operatic at its core but withing the modern age. The musical score is very beautiful and meditative. <br/><br/>Arrival isn't just about language and communication, it's also a journey about spiritual self, and your story within the realm of your reality. A beautiful masterpiece. 10/10"

","I don't really plan on any spoilers, but be aware that I might say something about the movie! I gave it a 9 because it deserved it. It was a great film for anyone to watch. It might be long for some people because it was more cerebral than say District 9 which was a Sci-fi action movie.<br/><br/>Amy Adams was great as Louise and was good for the part as a linguist trying to crack the language code and honestly communicate with the aliens. She had special gifts as well as will be seen at the end of the movie which I will not divulge.<br/><br/>Ian was great as a person who grew to love Louise as the movie progressed. I think he not only loved her as a woman, but respected her intellect. He was a physicist (I believe), or a rocket scientist, and he gave her the biggest compliment one could give: he told her she reasoned like a mathematician. He was right if you watch the movie, her reasoning with alien communication was impeccable.<br/><br/>Forrest Whittaker played a Colonel in charge of the operation. He is really a top notch African American actor. I've liked him ever since I saw him in the ""Last Kind of Scotland"" or something to that effect. He played Idi Amin, the brutal dictator from Uganda...and he was GOOD! He is as good as the black dude who played on The Matrix.<br/><br/>Anyway, the lead characters played their parts very well.<br/><br/>This movie is VERY unique because it took the avenue of trying to communicate with an alien life form versus Independence Day where survival of mankind was at stake. The music was as haunting as in the movie ""War of the Worlds"" with Tom Cruise, or maybe ""The Shining."" It gave a creepy feel to the movie! Bottom line for me: see the movie, you won't be disappointed."
"brian-waldbillig","10","1","5","8 August 2017"," Beyond 'how' to 'what' and 'why'
","Just the other day I finally saw The Arrival and I was struck by the first exchange between the two specialists chosen to try and figure out a way to communicate with the aliens visitors who parked their spaceship in Montana without bothering to ask the permission of the US government. Technically, their presence in US airspace and on US soil constituted an invasion; presumably China and the ten other nations around world that suddenly found themselves unconsentingly hosting alien spaceships (warships?) saw the situation in similar fashion.<br/><br/>Jeremey Renner's character tries impressing Amy Adam's character by reading her a passage from one of her books in which she claims that language is the foundation of civilization. He compliments her both on the sentiment she expresses and on the beauty of her writing, but immediately corrects her. For him it's obvious that the foundation of civilization is science, not language. This odd flirtation between the two eggheaded academics is destined to ... well, you should see the movie if you want to know what happens next.<br/><br/>What struck me was this: In reality, both characters are wrong. Completely and utterly wrong about origin and foundation of civilization. Science/technology and language are two separate, distinct, and complimentary means by which civilization is communicated. Neither science nor language is the 'stuff' of civilization. They provide the 'how' but not the 'what' and 'why'.<br/><br/>To my estimation, the 'what' and 'why' constitute civilization, and it's religion (in it's broadest and most basic sense) that furnishes the 'what' and 'why' of civilization for us and, presumably, for beings like us. Religion itself, in the sense of the universal spiritual impulse that I've described elsewhere, arises in response to the need for meaning, purpose, and connection. It's all well and good to be able to communicate, to have the means for communication, but without a connection, without personal intimacy, you're not likely to share anything that is of value and meaning to you. But when both parties have a shared purpose that gives some meaning to an otherwise meaningless existence, they choose to become intimate with each other, like lovers. And from the intimacy of beings who love each other, family arises, continuing across space and through time a love that creates and protects and expands and binds together. <br/><br/>Love becomes the 'what' and 'why' that brings together beings who once were strangers and makes of them a spiritual family, and from the love of the spiritual family religion is born. So maybe what I said about religion and civilization wasn't quite precise, since religion is also a means, a tool, by which the love that creates the spiritual family is formalized, institutionalized, made lasting, made present to the world. The foundation of our civilization (and presumably of other civilizations) is the generative love that creates life within a community, which we call the family."

","The two main themes of this film, that time is illusion and that communication is essential to peace, are fundamental to Buddhism. But, while Buddhism is popular in China, this film misrepresents Chinese communication, and also how members of the United States Army communicate with one another, and how our television reporters report news. The Chinese people, speaking Mandarin or Cantonese or any other dialect, didn't indicate pronunciation in writing until the Chinese government developed a system of transliteration into the Roman Alphabet in the twentieth century. But the film says that writing every human language indicates pronunciation, ignoring that every Chinese word is a one-syllable name for a picture, a picture that doesn't independently indicate pronunciation. And the film also blames China for the main failure to communicate it portrays and says, contrary to the last past decade of the history of Earth, that Russia is in cahoots with China. You can talk with a soldier and watch news on television to see other discrepancies in the film's communication. But most of us prefer the Greco/Roman and Judeo/Christian/Islamic ignorant bigotry of sports. HITRT"

It makes you wonder about things and how interconnected we all are on this planet. Universe? It filled me with warmth by the time it was over. I love a movie that does that to me.

"WondrousMoose","9","1","5","18 July 2017"," Balancing intellect and emotion, Arrival is a truly remarkable sci-fi experience.
","What would happen if an alien race visited Earth? Artists and authors have been answering this question for over a century, bringing different perspectives to the issue. While the portrayal of hostile extraterrestrials attacking the earth is certainly popular, there is a place in science fiction for stories of diplomatic visits, exploring how other civilizations may interact with ours and how humanity deals with changes on this level.<br/><br/>When large spacecrafts land around the world, Colonel GT Weller (Forest Whitaker) brings in linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to assist in translating the aliens' words and writing. Together with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Louise works to communicate with the ""heptapod"" aliens, while at the same time, she is haunted by flashes of her daughter's life and early death. As tensions build and the threat of global war grows, Louise must find out why the aliens have come and what their visit means for humanity.<br/><br/>I find that one of the film's strengths is its portrayal of how people around the globe react to the heptapods' arrival. We see people rioting, a radio personality calling for violence against the aliens, governments reacting through paranoia, and more. In its purest sense, Arrival is a movie about people that also features aliens. It uses their arrival as a backdrop for a story about people, in more ways than you could ever expect when walking into it.<br/><br/>Arrival is a rare film that can balance ideas and emotions in such a way that neither overpowers the other and both can be integral to the film's character. This is without a doubt one of the finest science fiction films of the last few years, if not the past decade, and I have personally recommended it to just about anyone who will listen to me."

","Dennis Villeneuve is becoming more and more mainstream as time passes, which is exciting news for both Cinephiles and Moviegoers. If one were to judge his filmmaking style based on his previous films, one would not expect a Science Fiction film to pop as a future possibility. Having said that, it is more than pleasant to watch him do this film. Arrival is perhaps one of the best Science Fiction film made in recent times.<br/><br/>The film is based on a popular short story called ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang, crafted for screen by Eric Heisserer. The plot revolves around linguistic professor Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams) who is assigned the task of interpreting the language of Alien visitors and understanding the purpose of their visit.<br/><br/>Arrival is such a refreshing take on the age-old Alien visiting Earth scenario. Not a scientist, but a linguist is called for help, to save the day. And she happens to be a WOMAN! Yes, Hollywood like many other institutions has had a notorious history when it comes to treatment of women. However, Dennis seems to be a part of the consciousness that actively celebrates women with most of his films having female leads. And since Arrival's heart lies in a mother-daughter relationship, it makes Louise's character all the more central to the story.<br/><br/>The mother-daughter relationship however is not as simply understood. The way the film opens one assumes the mother-daughter montage to be a past memory, and the grief of Louise losing her daughter seems to weigh down on her present condition. However, only later is it realized that this was a future memory completely redefining Louise's character.<br/><br/>t's quite an achievement to make a non-linear narrative tangible in the linear format of a film. Although this is not the first time this has happened. Filmmakers have been playing with time since the very beginning of film. This brings us to one of the ideas that this film deals with, Non-linear time. Like in film, the time that we perceive in real life is extremely linear, meaning it keeps moving forward. However, that's a very classical understanding of time. Is time really that simple? Can it not pause, stop, move backwards or jump forward? Such ideas have been a staple diet for science fiction writers. And Arrival seems to have a take of it's own.<br/><br/>Similarly, the idea of intelligent life existing outside our solar system has fascinated many throughout the years. And such fascination has most colorfully translated into various pieces of art. And why must it not? It's the same kind of curiosity, which resulted in various real life inventions.<br/><br/>It is not just ""the apple falling on Newton's head"" scenario but many real life scientific inventions have in fact been inspired by science fiction. Take the Rocket for example. Robert H Goddard who successfully built and launched the first liquid-fueled rocket was immensely influenced by HG Wells' classic novel about a Martian invasion, War of the Worlds. At the age of 16, when he first read the book, he was so moved that he decided to pursue spaceflight as a real life possibility. Science fiction and real world science are not as mutually exclusive as one might think.<br/><br/>So what real science possibilities does Arrival bring forward? No one knows, that only time (whatever that is) will tell.<br/><br/>Keeping the future possibilities aside, the film currently has a lot to offer from the use of language to visual representation of alien life.The language used by Heptapods is non-linear; having no directions, essentially making it free of time. This further raises a thought that maybe this is how the Heptapods think too, free of the linear human logic. That can be taken as a very interesting comment on our culture of thinking which is based on cause and effect, the very foundation of human logic. This thought is mirrored in dialogues such as ""Language is the foundation of a civilization"" or ""Language is the first weapon drawn in a conflict"".<br/><br/>As the film progresses, the humans start to learn their language moving the film into its final act. It is understood that the Heptapods want to 'offer weapon' which causes immediate mass panic and hysteria. However, Louise points out that weapon might not have the same meaning as it does for humans. Heptapods might not even realise the difference between a weapon and a tool. Here's another example of the beautiful ideas that his film is full of and how effortlessly it portrays it. Such ideas are an example of good storytelling, which provokes deep thought rather than serving the audience with all the answers. Arrival like many of Dennis's other films is full of such moments.<br/><br/>The film builds up on you slowly. It's not just a one-time affair. It leaves you with a lot of curious thoughts. As the film closes, towards the end it even brings up the paradox of non-linear time. Louise has a lapse of the future memory where she meets General Shang. In the future however she does not remember her past, which is the film present. It seems that only in her future is she realizing the past memory. Maybe, that is the true nature of non-linear time. One might have access to the future and the past but one in no way could influence it. And that is perhaps why the Heptapods arrived in the first place."

","Arrival Scores and Review Script: 9/10 Acting: 8/10 (Adams was amazing but I thought Renner was weird) Visuals + Cinematography: 10/10 Character development and inner thoughts: 9/10 Review: Started 2017 with a great film. First off, let me tell you how much I love the camera work and directions in this movie. The visuals are stunning, and the camera angles add to the emotions of the characters (I love the different angles that used on Amy Adam's face to convey her different feelings). The scene where they introduced us to the UFO in Montana was done beautifully. I WAS SCREAMING because of the aesthetically pleasing nature of the scene. Okay, then the acting was really really freaking good, especially Amy Adam's. Her every movement makes me jump off my seat in excitement or fear or sometimes even joy. Amy's performance is terrific, sending chills down my spine. Notably, in the scene where she talked to Abbott and Costello, her facial expressions were beyond amazing - conveying fascination, fear and pure happiness all in one shot. Stunning performance! The message of the film is poetic and could not be more relevant to today's political situation. The film wants to teach its watchers that they must join forces and work as a united entity to achieve success, which in the movie is the gift, a universal language. The beautiful message is hidden in the dialogues between Ian and Louise. Speaking of the dialogue, there's one conversation in the movie I want to praise particularly. It was delivered towards the end of the movie, where Louis asks Ian ""If you could see your life from beginning to end, would you change it?"" to which Ian answers ""No, I would just find a way to express my love more"". The script is brilliant, and those two lines will go into my book of good lines for sure. Overall Arrival is a thought-provoking, beautifully executed and emotionally touching movie that I would have my future kids sit down and watch with me."

","When people think of sci-fi films or shows, they immediately think something along the lines of Star Trek/Star Wars/Firefly/Halo-like universe. Something with aliens, space travel, exploration, etc.<br/><br/>I believe there should be different sub-genre's of sci-fi; one for the generic futuristic sci fi setting we are all used to... and others that explore potential scientific approaches to first contact. Unlike Star Trek's flawed trope of universal translator, Arrival explores the simple incidence of that first contact. There is 0 action, there is almost no real PROGRESS in any goals other than communicating in the entirety of the movie. The film feels slow paced but you still felt the suspense. The soundtrack's ominous and eerie tone is also perfect in how they portray things we had not considered about some sci-fi aspects such as gravity manipulation.<br/><br/>All the while of exploring a great sci-fi theme, it tells a beautiful story of the character Louise which I believed could have been a separate movie of its own considering how many people can relate to that sort of thing."

","I went into this film aware of its reputation and the praises it received from critics; and rightfully so. The film is subtle and simple, it doesn't blast your senses with a lot of special effects and convoluted plot lines, though it does require you to pay attention. However, it does so in such a way that your attention is held without being overwhelmed. The film conveys a nice balance of tension and drama and portrays a reasonable, real-world reaction to a sudden alien presence. Now, perhaps it was the wine or the fact that I have a young son and am already emotional compromised, but this film had me in tears from start to finish. It hit me on an emotional level but also made me think. The plot focuses on time and communication, both of which are extremely important, and the significance of timely communication. It is amazing to me that the subject of communication and how easily it can be misinterpreted or misunderstood is such a universal thing, and yet people in this world too often don't stop to really think about it. Too many things have to happen on a dime and real conversations are lost within a person's personal desires and views; minds can so easily be changed if we simply take the time to listen and communicate."

","I went into this not expecting much, just another Hollywood flick about nasty aliens and heroic humans saving the hordes of homo sapiens infecting the globe. <br/><br/>I came away surprised at the intelligent story and the great atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a few plot holes here and there, but less than some have mentioned there being. <br/><br/>The following are true:<br/><br/>1) NASA and the US government have almost certainly people on staff that specialise in communicating with aliens, if such an event would occur. Probably have a whole bunch of plans set up for such an eventuality. Them being caught with their pants down like this is a bit silly. <br/><br/>2) The Aliens being able to understand the audio and visual input Louise is giving them is very unlikely. I mean, I hardly hear her whisper in that suit. <br/><br/>However, here comes the whole idea of the film into play, they understand her because they ALREADY HAVE. Same as she suddenly understands them by having future-memories, they would have known what she was trying to say because they can remember it from the future. <br/><br/>She also learns it much faster as you would normally expect because she already has done so, even subconsciously. It's not a superpower, it's because at one point she has learned to think like they do and that means that her present self also does. From the moment they meet she is in this forever loop. <br/><br/>3) Nothing is explained about why they are there and how POOF their ship can disappear!<br/><br/>It is explained, the gift/weapon is what humanity will use to save the aliens in the future. The Aliens already KNOW that's is all they have to do since this enough to set the humans on the right path. This is the skill they need. We do not know the threat yet, maybe it's actually from us? <br/><br/>It's okay to leave it like this, keep some mystery in the story. Not everything needs to be overly explained away. <br/><br/>The ship, well possibly it's not even there to begin with. It's rather like explaining the workings of a TV to a cat. Is the rabbit really there because you can see it and hear it?<br/><br/>The aliens tell them that the 12 ships are 1, and everything happens at the 12 locations at the same time as well. They give out the exact same information to everyone.<br/><br/>It could be a recording even sent from their dimension/ world and just beamed at 12 locations for convenience. <br/><br/>Also explains why there is no radiation or anything coming off the ship. <br/><br/>That we don't understand exactly how this works and it's not explained is good, gives you something to ponder. <br/><br/>The future-memories sometimes get a bit much, certainly at the end. But that's also the heart of the movie. <br/><br/>If you know your future, that you will have a child but they will die from a deadly horrible disease...would you still do it? How would you live with knowing the future? <br/><br/>She accepts this in the end, when in her future-memory he ask her if she wants to make a baby, she says yes. <br/><br/>Knowing he will leave her because he can't deal with the truth and the child will die. <br/><br/>I don't know, but all of this makes the movie pretty special. And makes me forgive the small flaws there are in the logic of some things. <br/><br/>The actors are pretty amazing too, although apart from Amy they are a bit under used. The music and cinematography are excellent and really left me stunned. <br/><br/>If you are looking for an independence day action flick, you are going to be bored silly. <br/><br/>If you want to immerse yourself in this strange reality, please watch as you will probably love it or at least be intrigued by it."

After i watched this movie, it really saddens me that it only won one Oscar (Sound Editing) despite being nominated in 8 categories.<br/><br/>The story begins when twelve spaceships inexplicably land on different parts of Earth and cause mass hysteria around the globe because no one knows what is the purpose of their arrival, which triggers a discussion whether the heptapod (name of the alien race) wants war or peace. But since the aliens are letting people enter their spaceship for two hours a day to study them, US military sends linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to understand the heptapod language and find out the meaning of their landing on Earth. Alongside this mission is Col.

","I believe the ""end state"" of viewing films is a desire for theatrical entertainment. We all love a good story. ARRIVAL delivered on both fronts; entertaining and good storytelling. <br/><br/>I very much enjoyed ARRIVAL and I felt thoroughly engaged throughout the entirety of the film. I do get it how everyone is different and some of the negative reviews certainly confirm this fact. Personally, I found myself deeply absorbed by the story. Just the same, I can understand the comments concerning some of the questionable directing examples such as the unimpressive method used to initially make contact with the aliens - (tiny whiteboard and dry erase marker with crude handwriting). For me, I chose to gloss right over such trivial moments in order to remain engaged with the story which was riveting and imaginative.<br/><br/>Some of my favorite sci-fi films are the more cerebral type: The Day the Earth Stood Still – 1951, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Contact and Close Encounters of the Third Kind just to name a few. Part of the entertainment I take away from such films was the thinking journey that was involved. ARRIVAL easily falls into this example.<br/><br/>Amy Adams performance was most effective in helping me to navigate the complexities of what was going on. Bravo to Amy for the impressive and moving lead role as well as hats off to fellow performances by both Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film and I highly recommend it."
"julesfdelorme","9","1","5","16 April 2017"," Faint yet High Praise
","Arrival I'm a bit late in my review on this film, but, when you consider the theme of time as a non linear force that threads its way through this film, perhaps I'm not actually late at all. I haven't been a very big fan of director Denis Villeneuve's work. Those who know me, know that I love odd and I love weird, but I just can't bring myself to forgive Villeneuve for what I consider to be the silly and unearned metaphor at the ending of Enemy or the long overwrought pointless tension of Prisoners. I just didn't buy into either of those film's premises. I understood what Villeneuve was trying to do in both films. So please stop trying to tell me that I just missed the point. I got the point in both cases. I just thought that the point was stupid. I probably would not have started watching Arrival if I had have known it was directed by Villeneuve. But in this film, Villeneuve seems to take a page out of Terrence Malick's playbook in the way that the story fades in and out of time with a dreamlike quality. And that gives Arrival exactly the right tone for its subject matter. The film, about a translator who is brought in to try to translate the language of aliens who have mysteriously visited the earth in different locations around the earth, falls down in a few places with the logic of its science and the behaviour of some of the characters. And it's not an easy movie. At times its dreamlike quality leaves you struggling to make sense of what exactly is going on or why you should care about what's going on. But in the end Arrival strives to be better than just another visited by aliens movie. It never indulges in easy emotional moments or in treating the audience like we're too stupid to understand it. The cast, including Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and the very underrated Forest Whitaker, is excellent, and the film makes you stop and think about how we take communication for granted and how difficult it could actually be if aliens were ever to actually pay us a visit to actually communicate with them. It is a very smart and challenging movie. Like much of Malick's work, and like most of Villeneuve's work, it is often flawed and imperfect. Yet Arrival, I think, is better than its flaws, and challenges us in a very interesting way. It's not a movie for everybody. But the fact that it does win over someone like me, who has never liked a Denis Villeneuve film before this, may give you a sense why you might want to watch it. I do recommend Arrival. In fact, I recommend it quite highly. It tries to be better than the usual fare in this genre. And in my opinion in succeeds more than it fails. This may seem like faint praise. But I mean it as very high praise indeed. Arrival is not like any other movie of its ilk that you are likely to see. It may not be for everyone, but it is more than worth the effort and the time to watch it and make up your mind about it yourself. Many of you should see Arrival. Not because it is perfect. But because it is not trying to be every other movie that you've ever seen. There is a famous story about two film critics being overheard as they cam out of a screening of Stanley Kubrick's 2001 when it was first released. One critic is said to have turned to the other and said ""I don't know if I've just seen the greatest movie ever made or if I should be asking for my money back."". Many movies since have tried to approach the high intelligence of Kubrick's great masterpiece. Arrival comes as close as any I've seen. For me that is the highest praise that I can give it. It's not 2001. But it comes close to being as enigmatic and as thought provoking. If you hated 2001, and many people do, don't go out and see Arrival. If you loved 2001 however, then Arrival may be about as close as you're going to get to a film that matches it. It doesn't quite get there. But the fact that it tries, the fact that it almost gets there, makes it worthy of attention. Not by everyone. But by those of us who want film to be more than mere entertainment. For those of us who like to be challenged and to be made to think, really think. Taken all in all, I think that Arrival is a great film. Don't go to see it if you're expecting anything like the many Star Wars sequels. But do see it if you want more than big explosions and catch phrases from a film. Do see Arrival if want more from a film than for it to be easy and obvious. And I do mean that as very high praise indeed."

","Very interesting nice realistic-like sf! Plot is brilliant, and I have to confess I actually did not understand it entirely after seeing and had to research IMDb for that.<br/><br/>Again, it's about time circles: Louise's daughter dies of cancer and she has flashbacks a couple of years before; she already knows the private number of general Chang that he is going to give her in a distant future, along with the very words that will make him change his mind and saves the world a war, and in 3000 years the aliens will need our help, they know this already. (The good news: it seems we will still be around by that time).<br/><br/>In some of the comments, Louise is accused of being selfish, because she knows what is going to happen to her daughter and still accepts to get pregnant. I understand the accusations, and I myself would do everything to cheat the inevitable and avoid a child. But: there's a thing about time circles, maybe she just couldn't avoid! After all, she became able to look in 4th dimension (time) and foresee future, but if there was no daughter this WASN'T the future. Like, if a paranormal gifted person tells me she sees me dying next day in crashing flight 241, so I cancel my ticket, she proved she is not para normally gifted because her viewing was incorrect.<br/><br/>Has also to do with the question whether universe is deterministic; do we have a free will or are we just driven by a bunch of physical and chemical processes in our heads, so that future basically can be calculated? I don't know, but actually exactly because of these contradictions I do not believe that viewings in future are really possible (in distance, maybe yes).<br/><br/>Minus point in the movie: it seems very improbable to me that there would happen such a strong rebellion in the US army in this critical situation, that authorities are disobeyed even getting to the point to enter advanced explosives into the space ship. This was probably added to avoid a lack of action in the movie and to have at least one explosion.<br/><br/>The part where she suddenly can stand the aliens physical environment including gasses etc., when she is lifted up by a black shuttle and meets Costello, actually I'm not sure how to interprete this, it's unclear to me. Was this all in her head, was the contact brought by telepathy and suggestion? Meanwhile, Costello knew a lot more about humanity and her mind, so it's possible, but not sure."

","Remember Abyss? Where the benevolent - but still threatening - aliens showed the human race that war was futile and we wept at the (cut in some versions) montage of awful things that the human race was capable of? Arrival was similar without being so dramatic.<br/><br/>Amy Adams lead the film well. In all honesty she carried the film as the other characters (other than her daughter) didn't really have much of a look in. It was interesting seeing Forrest Whittaker play very much the second fiddle, although he played it very much to type. Other characters were more or less obsolete, with the exception of a few nagging mozzies flying around to provide a little tension and the necessary conflict, much of which was - like a mozzie - just in need of a sharp slap. She was excellent as Linguist Louise, very understated and sedate albeit a a little too ""monotone"" and ""internal."" The whole film was a little laid back, never quite enough tension to feel any real threat, and the characters other than Amy weren't deep enough to really care about. That said, Jeremy Renner was nice, but it was never really explained exactly what his purpose was, or rather what input he achieved, in terms of the First Contact, and was in a subsidiary role to Louise.<br/><br/>That all said, I loved the film and I really enjoyed how it weaved the convergent narratives neatly and beautifully and kept you guessing. I wasn't surprised by the twist, and had suspected as much, noticed the little clues, but it was still really well achieved. The story was clever, simple (premise) yet intelligently brought to the screen. I think the quietness brought a strength to the simplicity but I think there wasn't enough emotion or variety of activity to make the film truly epic; not enough tension in the international political scene, or from the aliens themselves. The teaching/learning scenes were cut too short/too staccato and too much was implied and glossed over, it was if the editor was too heavy handed and trying to go for intrigue, just omitted some of the plot. There was too much process that I felt needed to be put back in, not for explanation (the plot was clear) but for interest. The learning of the language, went from ""my name is..."" to sentences without actually showing the process - it needed a little delineation, more explanation of the circles, as I was interested.<br/><br/>Mention must be made of the SFX - reminiscent of Independence Day - and faultless. The aliens ""Abbott"" and ""Costello"" were excellent; their mode of communication beautiful and the real first contact was really quite special. The (for wont of a better word) 'space ships' that the heptopods arrived in were beautiful too and some of the best SFX were their departure and their existence and presence on the screen with helicopters/ships etc, and the gravity scenes were well done.<br/><br/>Overall a watchable, beautiful and intelligent film, and whilst on the surface it seems perfect, and I don't need linear story lines or over-explanation of things, and it did what it was meant to do in terms of storytelling, I feel that it was missing something, the profundity of gripping emotion and heart-pounding tension. It had more scope but just fell a little short. Less is more, and I like how that is generally employed here, going against the grain of Hollywood overkill, and also how America weren't perfect, and China (the great Tzi Ma) were the heroes and leaders of the conclusion (with Louise of course). An awesome experience of cinematography that I would recommend."

","'Arrival' is a masterpiece—it was, it is, and it will be. <br/><br/>This film balances the alien sci-fi element with its motifs of unity and balance. The language of the aliens shows the power of balance. We see balance between individuals (e.g.: Ian and Louise), balance between countries, and balance between the sciences (e.g.: numerical methods and linguistics). These balanced converge on the main thesis: a balanced worldview, in which we make decisions seeing the end from the beginning. <br/><br/>This movie involved me on a deep emotional level, and makes me want to be a better person. But on to the technical side. The pacing was excellent—it keeps the viewer involved throughout. The accurate linguistics and scientific analysis delighted me. The governmental decisions were understandable, though often frustrating (this was deliberate—I was grateful for the point they were making). The visual effects were well done and not overbearing. The use of time was clever and enjoyable, reflecting the theme well. <br/><br/>I wholly recommend this film to everyone."

","This movie was difficult to rate.<br/><br/>It is sentimental and cathartic. My guess is that the stereotypical man will view it as a chick flick. It's more about a woman's love for her daughter than it is about the aliens.<br/><br/>Cerebral, slow-paced and lacking in thrills, explosions, and chase scenes, it's target audience is adults (women?). Your stereotypical tween and teen males will find it boring.<br/><br/>Some aspects of it were cringe worthy, other aspects were enjoyable, lovely and intelligent. The sci-fi aspect goes beyond aliens and into the realm of, if I'm not mistaken, the fabric of space and time.<br/><br/>Overall I liked it and will even praise the cringe worthy parts for a good effort."

"TheJediWay9","9","1","5","23 March 2017"," ""Arrival"" is a well-directed, thought-provoking film about understanding extra terrestrial life.
","""Arrival"" is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whitaker, and when alien spacecrafts touch down on Earth, Louise, played by Amy Adams, is asked by the US government to interpret and understand why and what they are doing here.<br/><br/>Don't go into ""Arrival"" expecting crazy action scenes and explosions. Though this is an alien invasion movie, it is a film that is grounded and winds up being a character study. We learn a lot about Amy Adams as a character (No bathtub scenes in this one). we learn about her troubled past, and we see how she acts when she feels the government starts to take too much control. She did a fantastic job in these scenes, and the entire cast did a very good job as well. <br/><br/>Tension in this film is very well presented. Though there are no action scenes, you feel as if the aliens could attack at any second, or the humans could attack at any second. It is very well realized. Almost any time a human enters the alien spacecraft it is presented in a way in which you feel like something bad is going to happen, and I really give the film props for that.<br/><br/>This movie is so well shot and well directed. Denis Villeneuve keeps proving himself as a director. Each shot in this film has a purpose. They way certain scenes are shot really help to ratchet up this tension that is presented in these scenes as well. The creature designs did kind of bother me but it's only a small nitpick. The aliens look like giant squids. That's basically all I can say about them.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the third act of the film. The third act of the film really makes you question the entire thing. There's a big revelation at the end, a plot twist in other words, and it really makes you wonder. There are some things that are glossed over in this third act, as it seemed a bit more focused on trying to be clever and smart, which it was. But this twist just seemed to come out of left field. It definitely didn't hinder the movie. It's a twist that makes you think long and hard. I have had multiple discussions with co-workers who have seen the film and some of them can't even figure out what the film was about. It's a film you really have to study, and this third act may detract some viewers. If there are people who don't really like sci-fi and are watching this film and then the twist happens, they may not understand it. I think it's a twist left open for many interpretations, and the film does a good job of selling that, but really doesn't answer some of the other questions it presents in its first two-thirds that you may have had. There were definitely some things that could have been explored more.<br/><br/>I am going to give ""Arrival"" a 9.2/10"
"blackfiregamer","9","1","5","22 March 2017"," E.T for adult
","I love science fiction movies, it is from my perspective a genre that pushes beyond the limit of comprehension and make us reconsider our own existence. A good Sci-Fi movie makes you doubt and question about yourself and the world surrounding you. When I heard about Arrival and all the positive feedbacks and reviews it received, my expectations were relatively high. I then watched the movie with a certain fear, the fear of being disappointed by all of this hype. Well I can say that the movie was not only up to my expectations, it went way above it.<br/><br/>The main story is fairly simple, twelve alien ships arrive in different part of the world. Nobody knows why. The whole movie plot resolve around the quest of communication between the aliens and humans. The main character is a linguist teacher named Louise Banks who lost her daughter prematurely because of cancer. The army request her help to develop a communication method with the aliens.<br/><br/>The idea of aliens showing up on our beloved earth is already known by the public, in most of the cases the aliens appear as hostile creatures whose only purpose is the destruction of the human race. Arrival on the other hand focus on the language barrier and the conflict it creates among the humans; how can we communicate with them without accidentally starting a war? The movie shows how limited and close minded our vision of language and time comprehension is, the aliens are not only here to enlightened the humans but the viewers themselves. The language barrier is as problematic with the aliens as it is with the humans and the various interpretations they deduce.<br/><br/>I was really amazed by the meeting sequence with the aliens, the right use of light and background music made the scene genuinely disarming, i couldn't stop thinking about «Encounter of the third kind», there is an echo between these two movies and the way they treat the human- aliens meeting. As a viewer mystery quickly substitute fear and you ended up being as curious as the protagonist.<br/><br/>From a purely technical point of view the movie is visually appealing, it's nothing revolutionary but it certainly good enough not to break the immersion. The most noticeable element was probably the editing and how coherent it is with the ending. The actor's play is also on the point, however the character's archetype seems a bit too linear and predictable in my opinion. I was a bit disappointed by the soundtrack, usually science fictions movies from this category tends to leave remarkable music that you will remember long after seeing the movie. It's unfortunately not the case here, it does the job but it's far from being a masterpiece.<br/><br/>In conclusion i highly recommend Arrival if you are a Science Fiction enthusiastic, it is without a doubt one of the best movie of 2016. It's a fresh sci-fi movie and a good surprise. Even if you are not a huge fan of sci-fi it's still has a strong and very well written story on it's side and i advice you to give it a try."

Some people have said they had some problem following the ending of the film and that is their fault. The film makes very clear what has happened. However if you remember the beginning, that's where your confusion will come. They surprise us by using nefarious tactics to ensure that we are surprised by the film's end.

Fear is quickly taking hold of many people, some of whom have the power to start a war with the alien visitors. If the ""Arrival"" of the aliens is meant to bring peace and friendship to humans, then it must be quickly confirmed before itchy trigger fingers causes an intergalactic war.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Arrival"" is the scene when the aliens are introduced. Let's just say if I was there, I'd either run screaming like a Wayans brother or start crying like Matt Damon.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" moves slowly, methodically, allowing the audience to soak in everything they hear and see. Although many characters are in this movie, almost all of the focus is on Adams and Renner, making ""Arrival"" feel more personal.

","Without honest Arrival is a kind of movie that critics like. To me it is too familiar and feels old fashion. The theme of Arrival has been be tangent in some Star Trek episodes and because of that it doesn't feel fresh idea to me. Arrival is a good movie, but somehow predictable and way too slow. As an episode of a television series it might work, but as a two hour movie it is simply too long. Even plot feels somehow clumsy. If you want to make serious science fiction film sappy romance won't be a part of it. Especially when chemistry between lead actors doesn't feel right in any level. End scene of the movie is also stupid and hasty. There is no real meaning for the aliens and suddenly they just disappear???. Beside all that Arrival is a quite good movie. It is not bad, simply too long and slow. It is a kind of movie that make movie critics pee honey. I am sorry to say that Arrival is not movie to me, even probably many people likes it.

","This was the first time I felt tears flow from my eyes while watching a film in response to a shocking revelation. Normally, you know, the tears come at a sad scene, or a particularly uplifting and gratifying scene; this film, by the stars above and fires below, ARRIVAL, completely blew me away. It puts even Interstellar to shame. I'm left with a vague feeling of astonishment that is strangely coupled with a sensation of enlightenment. For not only did ARRIVAL storm my mind like the tornado that whisked Dorothy away, but ARRIVAL also taught me some things about linguistics, temporality, international relations, and the importance of one's own child and the special moments that you, as a parent, spend with him or her.<br/><br/>The essence to all mediums of art - whether film, anime, literature, etc. - is to further our understanding of what makes us human. This is what defines us, what distinguishes us from the lesser animal. ARRIVAL is a story involving aliens. I've seen/read quite a few stories with aliens - but ARRIVAL trumps them all in terms of, simply, its call to humanity. It is a very realistic film; the chaos that ensues after the 12 UFOs suddenly appear throughout the globe is probably what will happen if a similar event occurs in our own world. What should happen if two sentient races of such disparity happen to meet? The first step is communication. ARRIVAL is a story of humans' attempt to communicate with, and ultimately understand, some aliens."

","""Arrival"" (2016) is an unusually smart and thought-provoking science fiction film. It isn't really intended by its creators as a ""twist movie,"" but it does include an unexpected component that should surprise and challenge the viewer. (I don't want to say more about it, for fear of spoilers.)<br/><br/>Amy Adams actually is a terrific actress, and she seems to do well in understated roles that require her to be thoughtful and deliberate. (Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are both quite good too, even if they seem confined to roles here that don't require much range.)<br/><br/>One caveat — this isn't a standard science fiction thriller. (Although ""Arrival"" has some decent suspense, I'm inclined to think that this shouldn't be considered a thriller at all.) I do think that viewers expecting a more mainstream film will be disappointed with this story conclusion's more subdued and unconventional payoff. (Again, I just can't say more here.)<br/><br/>I'd rate this an 8 out of 10; and I would recommend it to science fiction fans."

"ClaytonDavis","9","1","5","19 February 2017"," 'Arrival' Is a Masterclass in Filmmaking With Amy Adams Magnified
","The science fiction genre has evolved into some of the most prolific imagery and storytelling of the silver screen. Denis Villeneuve's splendid ""Arrival"" has the foreign director taking on uncharted territory and putting forth his finest film of his career yet.<br/><br/>Starring Academy Award nominee Amy Adams, ""Arrival"" tells the story of unidentified spacecrafts that enter the earth's atmosphere. Just hovering over the ground in dozens of locations around the world, it is up to a linguist and a scientist to break the language barrier and find out if their intentions are honorable or hostile.<br/><br/>Natural comparisons will emerge to Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar,"" and while that film's ambition was generally accepted and positive, ""Arrival"" taps into something Nolan's film only hoped to achieve. The exquisite class in which Villeneuve's film exists is such a daunting and audacious triumph. Eric Heisserer's script may at first feel familiar, perhaps too much so, as the first half of the film seems like the same foundation we saw with Alfonso Cuaron's ""Gravity."" When the story is turned on itself in a soft and credible fashion, ""Arrival"" opens itself up as one of the year's most brilliant feats.<br/><br/>With performances that have spanned a vast net of quirky and strong supporting players (i.e. ""Junebug"" and ""The Fighter""), Amy Adams has emerged as a fully realized leading lady. While some will attest her previous lead roles in ""Enchanted"" and to a lesser extent ""American Hustle"" as proof that she's already mounted this campaign, discovering what she does here will make you change your perception. She is a talented artist, sensitive and endowed with the tools of a legendary actress. It is a beautiful work.<br/><br/>Co-stars Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are served well in their minimal roles. As the slick but engaged scientist, Renner approaches his role with the utmost candor. Whitaker, as an army leader, is blunt, honest and frank – everything you would want in anyone playing a character such as this.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Bradford Young is utterly suave in his usage with the lens. Already capturing our hearts with his works on ""Selma"" and ""A Most Violent Year,"" Young's glossy and poised framework is not only exciting, but visually moving.<br/><br/>For the third year in a row, composer Johann Johansson raises the bar for nearly all creators of the musical language. ""The Theory of Everything"" and ""Sicario"" were just the beginning for him. He mounts an orchestra of vast sensations. The sentiment of each scene is built within Johansson's response to the words on screen. He not only has respect for the visual works being created, he compliments the details in which the expressions and languages endure. It's another Oscar-worthy work that will undoubtedly bring him another nomination.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" is a film that can seem bigger than itself. Perhaps it's even ""too smart."" However, movies should challenge the viewer. The stamina of a film rests on its tenacity and persistence to dare the viewer to explore new thoughts and feelings. ""Arrival"" achieves just that. It is a film that should be noted in multiple Oscar categories and revered by all except the most impudent viewer. This film is not to be missed.<br/><br/>GRADE: (★★★★)"
"tomgillespie2002","9","1","5","12 February 2017"," One of the finest sci-fi pictures of the past decade
","Anyone who may be somewhat hesitant to let themselves get too hyped- up about the upcoming sequel to Ridley Scott's sci-fi masterpiece Blade Runner (1982) can now at least be assured that the movie is in the safest hands possible after viewing director Denis Villeneuve's Arrival, one of the most intelligent and thoughtful first contact pictures in recent memory. Arrival's November release date goes some way to indicate the kind of audience the film is going for: just in time for awards season and about as far removed from the CGI-laden destruction-athons that litter the summer as you can get. No monuments are blown to smithereens here, nor does the American President deliver a stirring speech to a chest-thumping crowd. Villeneuve's concerns lie with the necessity to communicate and the strength to be had in unity.<br/><br/>Adapted from Ted Chiang's short story Story of Your Life, Arrival begins by establishing the mindset of its heroine Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguist who is in mourning over the loss of her daughter to cancer. During one of her lectures, she is asked to turn on the news, where it is being reported that twelve alien spacecrafts have touched down at seemingly random locations around the world. One of the giant, egg-shaped ships touches down close by in Montana, while others hover mysteriously in the likes of Australia, China and Russia. They don't emit any gas or toxins, and their purpose and intent are frustratingly unclear. Naturally, all hell breaks loose across the globe with looting, violence and plummeting stocks leading the media to dub this an 'alien crisis', and Russia and China becoming increasingly nervous.<br/><br/>Having participated in a Farsi translation a couple of years earlier, Louise is brought in by U.S. Army Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to help communicate with the alien beings, along with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). A base has been set up at the Montana location, and Louise quickly establishes contact with the two giant creatures, who Ian dubs Abbott and Costello. They communicate by ejecting a substance from their tentacles, which manifest in circular symbols, each slightly differing from one another. With Weber and CGI Agent Halpern (Michael Stuhlbarg) insisting that time it of the utmost importance, Louise must decipher the alien language and establish the reason for their arrival as other countries do the same, and before an over- eager China strike first without knowing the extra- terrestrials true intentions.<br/><br/>Time and non-linearity are central to the film's themes, and Arrival's careful pace and fractured narrative will certainly frustrate anyone hoping to see a traditional alien invasion picture. Screenwriter Eric Heisserer and Villeneuve have much bigger ideas than to have both sides simply blow each other up. The film shares more in common with Contact (1997) and Interstellar (2014); more philosophical and contemplative works of science-fiction that raise the big questions. But this is not two hours of chin-stroking, as Villeneuve repeats his Sicario trick of building a tense atmosphere full of dread and trepidation. The first glimpse of the alien ship is an otherwordly experience, as Johann Johannsson's score blares out horns and deep rumbles, like the song of a whale from another planet. It's all anchored by Adams' terrific, restrained performance, as she channels pain and frustration through her tough, closed-off exterior. One of the finest sci-fi pictures of the past decade, and one that cuts to the very fabric of what it means to be human. The Replicants are surely in safe hands."
"fieres","7","1","5","20 February 2017"," Fascinating meditative film
","I begin with saying that the best part about this film are the single star rated reviews. Some of them are so hilarious and I can relate to them. The thing with this film is to treat it as a meditative medium on notions such as past, present and future (time and space)where they seem to merge, where one is to appreciate the present and let go of the future, on our bonds that unite us or divide us as humans etc. In this regard I found it spiritual and serene. Apparently the director goes for this approach because even with some tension that arises during the film, this is dealt deftly and 'outside' the canvas so that any excitement is squashed before our mind registers what is going on. I did get frustrated sometimes especially in the first half with the dialogue which is very absent and sometimes unintelligible and not revealing and the silence that permeates the film, minimal soundscore, characters are not developed and seem to be in a permanent state of suspension. But then I reckoned this is that type of film, where one has to let go any preconceptions and just absorb with what is going on on screen . That way I enjoyed it and kept me thinking afterwards"
"jb_campo","8","1","5","20 February 2017"," Thoughtful and moving
","Arrival is a thought-provoking science fiction movie. The plot revolves around alien ships that look like eggs that appear over 12 countries and open themselves for interaction with each country. Amy Adams is the linguistic professor who teams up with a physicist played by Jeremy Renner to try to communicate with the ship that hovers over America.<br/><br/>The Director Villeneuve builds tension using pressure between the countries, each trying to break through and find out why the aliens are here. There are very clever usages of time-like flashbacks that give some clues, but what does it mean? There was excellent chemistry between Adams and Renner. Forest Whitaker plays the Colonel in charge and he does an OK job. <br/><br/>The most interesting part is how each race learns to communicate with each other. The scenes inside the egg ship are really well done from a CGI and story viewpoint. <br/><br/>This movie will keep you guessing until the end, and even then, you might be left wondering if you got everything. And if you like those kinds of movies, this one will touch you deeply from the human standpoint. Director Villeneuve also made Enemy and Prisoners - I recommend both highly. I also recommend Arrival as an excellent example of a movie where plot and acting skills are so key to the success and your experience. Enjoy Arrival!"

"witster18","6","1","5","19 November 2016"," grabbed a fellow movie buff and went to see this last night...
","Like I said, I'm a big movie-buff no doubt. I've seen about 4k films, and my sidekick for the night had seen about the same. We're always talking films, and when the wife stammered at the prospects of seeing ""Arrival"" for my birthday, I called-up Chris and we decided to grab a brew and catch a movie.<br/><br/>So I go in with pretty high expectations. Villeneuve had really caught my attention. From Incedies(8/10), to Prisoners(9/10), to Enemy(6.5-7/10), and Sicario 7.5-8/10.. I could easily say that Villeneuve is among the top 2-3 directors that I'm currently awaiting their next projects. I was giddy about him being attached to direct the new Blade Runner, and I went into the theater to see what all the hype is about(8.5imdb), and to get a look at Villeneuve's sci-fi ventures. <br/><br/>We were disappointed. <br/><br/>First, It's a heavy film. A very difficult watch. And while I actually dig the 'fill-in-the-holes' aspects of direction(on occasion) that don't feel the need to spoon-feed you everything, and I understand that this is also a characteristic of European directors, there is a point where it can become a distraction, and like the case here, end-up as a fairly empty shell, or an incomplete thought.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" is thought provoking, but far from 'entertaining'. The film moves at a snails-pace, and fails to really connect any dots down the stretch. It makes me want to watch it again to see what else I can figure-out about what it all means, but it will be another difficult 2 hrs, and may not be the most fruitful adventure. <br/><br/>I'm no Albert Einstein, but I have scored above 120 on 3/4 official iq tests(119 on the other), and Chris is a smart guy too, but I also know that the movie community will flock to the ever-so-oft used, ""they just don't 'get-it'"" fall-back. Oh I get it, and I found it to be very boring. It definitely made me try to connect a lot of the dots, and in that aspect it was a success. But, in terms of overall entertainment, or me being able to figure out what was trying to be said late... like an f-16 zooming over my head. That's the way I feel about the current 8.5 rating too. Really? Eeek. <br/><br/>Amy Adams is good. The film looks great. There are a few really cool aspects in terms of Amy's interaction with the aliens, but past that... booooooring. <br/><br/>The fact that we thought it was boring doesn't make us stupid - it makes us honest. We listened to the films' deep thoughts concerning time- continuum and seeing into the future... the whole dejavu aspect is at the core of the sci-fi, intellectual ""do you get it"" here, but unlike say ""interstellar"", what lies in between is far less 'entertaining'. <br/><br/>We sat and watched the credits roll and talked about the film and about some of the ideas and concepts it dabbled-into in it's latter half, and none-of-it really made much sense, and the film just seemed so unconcerned-with it making sense, and even more so, keeping our attention.<br/><br/>This film is NOT for everyone. I expect it will receive mostly favor from the hardcore movie-buffs on websites like IMDb, but I think this score is destined for the mid-7's, even if it takes a while, and will forever be considered an avante garde piece. THis is NO ""Close Encounters"", that I can tell you unequivocally. It's not that cohesive, character-driven, or entertaining.<br/><br/>62/100<br/><br/>Probably not nearly as bad as I'm making it sound, but I(we) definitely left a little disappointed, and there was a collective audible gasp when the film ended. The kind you get when you see a film that dashed expectations. DId I mention it looks good? SOunds good too. Acting is solid across the board.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this to the average-joe. It's pretty tough for a seasoned movie-buff, and I wonder about the legitimacy of a large part of the positive written reviews, especially since so many were written before release and didn't cite the festival or location in which it was viewed. All this coming from the guy who drew conclusions and read into the depths of a film like say, ""Goodbye Dragon Inn"". Very, very ambitious, and very, very deliberate. A tough watch!<br/><br/>Call me stupid - I'm sticking with 6/10. That rewatch won't be anytime soon. Dunno if this was a tune-up or just an artistic vision that just doesn't translate into a cookie-cutter mold. SOme people will praise it for that - personally found it to be lacking too much... character-depth.. cohesion... no defined climax.. meaning? A little dumbfounded this morning."

","It was disappointing for me. I was expecting the movie would show more of the process of understanding the language of aliens which looked very interesting with the circular patterns and all. I wished the movie explored more of that. I think it lacked focus because it continuously went in flashback which I did not understand the significance of. I think there is a deeper concept underlying the story which the director was not able to convey properly. The cinematography was also not all that great. I liked the alien's spaceship. Also liked the idea of graphical written language in a circle which is faster to write. Wanted to see a lot of communication between aliens and humans which didn't happen. The protagonist's personal life story was unexpected and not required. A rare movie where aliens are not attacking. Peace."

Despite falling to the usual Hollywood theme of vilainizing foreign powers like China and Russia and portraying again the Americans as the only rational thinking country of the planet earth (Donald Trump seriously ? ) this movie is by far one of the best sci-fi thrillers/drama to date . Using hard science to back up its theories and understandings that we have acquired recently as a species about how space , time and the understanding of these variables tie together with the way we perceive the world , the movie stands apart from Alien invasion and VFX overload movies and delivers suspense and drama in a league of its own .

"StoryArchitect","9","1","6","2 August 2017"," ARRIVAL: 9 / The Chess Game of Art -- My Silver Knight Rating System Explained
","Cinema is Art--a grand creative chess game costarring Form and Story. And in keeping with the metaphor of chess, I cast these costars in the role of knights: the White Knight of Form and the Black Knight of Story. When I evaluate a movie, I evaluate the performance of each knight.<br/><br/>But these two knights not only stand alone. On the rectangular chessboard of the silver screen, the White Knight of Form and the Black Knight of Story also partner as one unified knight, through collaborative ""conflict""--""the basis of every art,"" as Sergei Eisenstein said in Film Form (1949). Just as opposing sides of a coin, heads and tails, partner as one unified coin.<br/><br/>In the Chess Game of Art, I dub this one unified knight The Silver Knight of Form & Story.<br/><br/>The Silver Knight of Form & Story is the Avatar of Art, which represents an ideal-- indicated by a perfect Silver Knight Rating of 10. The Silver Knight Rating reflects my restrained judgment as to how well a movie hits this mark.<br/><br/>And the Silver Knight Rating measures more than my intellectual perception of where a movie falls along the spectrum of artistic merit that ranges from mediocrity to mastery. The Silver Knight Rating also factors in how psychologically pleasing I find the movie, how deeply the movie impacts me emotionally . . . induces catharsis . . . inspires in me an involuntary welling up of ""aesthetic emotion""*--a term coined by Clive Bell in Art (1914) that Robert McKee redefined in Story (1997) as ""moments that blaze with a fusion of idea and emotion . . . the simultaneous encounter of thought and feeling."" The Silver Knight Rating reflects the power of a movie's presentation of Form & Story to do what McKee says life typically can't do, but art can: unite insight and emotion.<br/><br/>My Silver Knight Rating of ARRIVAL:<br/><br/>White Knight (Form): 9<br/><br/>Black Knight (Story): 9<br/><br/>=<br/><br/>Silver Knight (Form & Story): 9<br/><br/>I developed my concept of Form & Story and my chess-based terms White Knight of Form, Black Knight of Story, and Silver Knight of Form & Story in my work as a practicing architect and architectural theorist. I draw from a deep well of research into literary theory and painting to highlight the concept of chess as an analogy or metaphor for art--and a metaphor in which the chess piece of the knight plays the lead role dating to at least Russian Formalist Victor Shklovsky's book Knight's Move (1923). I have written extensively about this research and the meaning of my special terms--for example, in my IMDb commentary on THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI. And in my book Visual Ef9ects.<br/><br/>But the terms Form and Story as applied to a building do not entirely parallel these terms as applied to a movie, so when it comes to movies, here's what I mean.<br/><br/>Form = Quality of Production. The Aesthetics of Sight & Sound. Cinematography & Soundtrack, including musical score and sound design. The visible and audible (optical and acoustical) expression of artistic choices that also include set design and film architecture, lighting, wardrobe, visual effects, and editing . . . as well as the quality of acting and directing.<br/><br/>Story = Quality of Screenplay. Shakespeare or hack? Does the screenplay present a good story well told? I base my rating on how much a movie sinks below or rises above this bar. For example, does the screenplay present a bad story well told? A ho-hum story told by an amateur? A great story beautifully told, rendered by a Story Master? And of course, Story itself represents an expression of Form, a very demanding expression of Form, requiring of the Story Architect special artistic powers and command of archetypal principles to first design an excellent story and then to craft its telling into an excellent screenplay. All of which factors into the dimension of cinema that I call Story.<br/><br/>So for example, by way of analogy with the allied art of the stage, if Bertolt Brecht's play GALILEO benefits from an outstanding production or suffers from a poor one, then the rating for Form would go up or down. But the rating for the play itself--Story--would stay the same.<br/><br/>For my rating of Form, I rely on a frame of reference shaped by my study of music and acting and by my work as a visual artist, principally as a practitioner and theorist of painting and architecture.<br/><br/>For my rating of Story, I rely on a frame of reference shaped by my education as a screenwriter, which helps me size up the degree to which a screenplay reflects advanced and inspired application of universal principles of Story Design spelled out in books like The Writer's Journey, by Christopher Vogler; Memo from the Story Department, by Christopher Vogler & David McKenna; Save the Cat!, by Blake Snyder; and Story, by Robert McKee.<br/><br/>I also factor in the degree to which Story Design measures up to what I call The Symbolic Rectangle, which I lay out in my IMDb commentary on MERU.<br/><br/>Bottom line, by way of analogy further afield, Does the expression of Form & Story that a movie presents have more to do with the level of amateur cycling that my nifty three-speed Brooklyn Flyer and my cycling skill set represent? Or with the level of professional cycling that we associate with the quality of bikes and skill sets of the competitors in the Tour de France?<br/><br/>Only movies that rank as worthy of the Tour de France, as it were, get highest Silver Knight Ratings.<br/><br/>Like ARRIVAL.<br/><br/>An expression of Form & Story summed up in one word: Exquisite.<br/><br/>Everything about the movie radiates creative genius--complex, deep, multi-layered, intellectually profound, and visually and aurally beautiful, building through its masterful story design to a stunning convergence of insight, exhilaration, and heartbreak. I'm one of the lucky few who saw ARRIVAL before laying eyes on the poster or knowing the genre or even the logline. Thank, God, because the IMDb logline gives away more than I'd want to know before plopping down in my seat at the theater: ""A linguist is recruited by the military to communicate with alien life-forms after twelve mysterious spacecrafts land around the world."" But, blissfully, the logline keeps us light-years from the heart of the story, what the story is really about. (Which I won't spoil here.) Including, thematically, what it means to be Human. Could there be a universal language of Time, which loops us continually around the circle of Life, flashing back, flashing forward, freeing us to experience boundless synchronicities of departure and arrival--on behalf of the survival and harmony of individuals and civilizations throughout our multi-dimensional universe? Can we control our destiny when we learn the universal language of Time? And what do we do when our humanity and time converge to require of us to make choices we cannot fathom making?<br/><br/>Just like THE INSIDER, the title of ARRIVAL has a double meaning. Two Insiders in THE INSIDER, not just Jeffrey Wigand, but also Lowell Bergman. Same with ARRIVAL. Two Arrivals in ARRIVAL--not just aliens. And like the constellation Orion in the night sky, this parallel Arrival hides in the title in plain view. If you know where to look for it, you can't miss it. And if you do miss it, the DVD special features, where Ted Chiang talks about his short story, adapted by Eric Heisserer for the screen, will give you a clue. No wonder the Academy nominated Heisserer's screenplay for Best Adapted Screenplay--it should have won.<br/><br/>ARRIVAL presents a stunning story, two symbolic stories woven together as one, rendered by a team of remarkable artists who give this exquisite Symbolic Story exquisite Visual Form.<br/><br/>___________________________________________<br/><br/>*NOTE: Robert McKee gives an ironic twist to the meaning of ""aesthetic emotion."" Clive Bell coined the term to defend abstract art. Aesthetics! Bell said that aesthetic emotion rises within us from the impact of the aesthetic dimension itself. Form triggers emotion! Meaning not required. In fact, Bell maintained (again, in defense of abstract art), Form is Meaning! The only ""Meaning"" required. No need for Meaning outside of Form or beyond the Meaning of Form itself. In my book ""VISUAL EF9ECTS: Architecture and the Chess Game of Form & Story,"" I highlight the clash early in the 20th-century between this British Formalist viewpoint (Clive Bell) and the Russian Formalist viewpoint (Victor Shklovsky). Bell vs. Shklovsky. And for the past 100 years, in the education and practice of architecture, Clive Bell's viewpoint has had the upper hand: Form. Form. Form! Abstract Form, yes; Story, no. Aesthetics, yes; Symbolics, no. Chess Moves, yes; Chess Meaning, no. My theory and practice of architecture takes the less popular position: Yes, to all of it.<br/><br/>Just like the Mother of the Arts today: Motion Pictures.<br/><br/>Whether for the big screen or the small screen--whether feature films like ARRIVAL or open-ended narrative TV series like the 62-episode BREAKING BAD--motion pictures of surpassing quality thrill us by the magic of Visual Storytelling. The screen--cinema and TV--is the primary artistic medium of our modern world, uniquely able to spellbind us by the dynamic double-edged sword of Form & Story, possessed of emotional superpowers that bring us face to face with the truth.<br/><br/>Long live the Silver Knight.<br/><br/>© copyright 2017 by JEF7REY HILDNER"
"botrytis","7","1","6","5 July 2017"," Like watching a Pepsi Commercial about unifying every human on this Earth
","So there is a language - presented by the aliens - which defines not only linear definitions as we humans usually use ours, it is more complex one that includes feelings, emotions, a shred of something universal where time isn't linear, meaning that it can stimulate your whole psyche, your memories in a way that even you will have memories about things you will (most likely) only encounter with in the future. That's a sweet concept and quite logical one when it's about time being relative (the past, present, future is basically one) and humans being a species with limited cognitive function that cannot quite comprehend how universe works yet.<br/><br/>Now the movie pretends to be an alien/science fiction movie but it figures that it's just a melodramatic story mostly based on the backlashes of idiotic human behavior - like marching aggressively against aliens without knowing what their intentions are - and fabled solutions - like changing someones determination by saying the last words of his dead wife in mandarin to make him sentimental -, which leads up to unifying every nation in our world; it's like watching a Pepsi Commercial. I mean, really, just like that everything was solved. <br/><br/>The conclusion of the movie is that if we know the future we will cherish our present more, every moment we live through. And the key to that ""power"" to feel, see the future is to have the Universal Language presented by aliens, who somehow want to help humanity, because in 3000 years they will ask for help from humans. The whole alien part of the movie fades away and makes us the protagonists, ending up this movie being a melodrama/soap opera story with cringe worthy narrative which holds focus on Earth not on Aliens, not on the whole Universe beyond our planet. Leaving us with a quite interesting and good concept with a ""could have been told much better"" overall movie. As you see, the part isn't well articulated where the human nature comes in. See, there are people who will cherish their present differently such as with hurting others for their own safety, they get into desperate positions where they have to ""Accept"" their predestined fate, because if not, well chaos will emerge. While this movie is focusing more on how much problems we have on Earth, fu** the Universe, an other timeless piece like The Contact looks beyond our imagination and still reflects on our humanity as well with a much more satisfying motion picture, but the Arrival is a good example for how could this story be told in another way. <br/><br/>So overall it's not a bad movie, nor perfect. It is a bit self- important storytelling with a narrative that we have already seen in other forms, versions quite several times before. The Concept is more interesting than the movie itself, which I believe is not that re-watchable as for example The Contact or Interstellar. <br/><br/>Rating: 6.7/10"

","I think we are all familiar with movies that have aliens coming to earth and not destroying things. This is not something that in this century hasn't been shown much in science fiction films. In the 20th century it was much more common with movies like close encounters, E.T, the day the earth stood still, contact and others which probably weren't as great. This century so far has had only one movie like that which is district 9. Everyone went to see it and they were blown away. It was obvious there would be no movie like that in this century. We were wrong apparently. Along came Arrival. When it was announced I was excited and it didn't disappoint. Not only is it well acted, not only is it well plotted and not only is it smart, the greatest thing about Arrival is that it is original. Most aspects of Arrival are original, from the look of the aliens to the look of the spaceship as well as its concepts and pace. I guess what will fascinate most is the incredible twist ending which will I am sure in the future be as iconic as the twist in 1968s planet of the apes. I won't spoil the ending for you so don't worry. The performances were pretty good but best of all was Amy Adam's performance which should win an Oscar. The concepts of this movie were pretty thought provoking and original mostly. The look of the spaceship and aliens was original as I already said but cannot be described.

","""Arrival"" is the story of a global alien invasion. Though this is far from the familiar fodder of ""our planet is in peril from intergalactic creatures intending malice and mayhem"".

Of course, the ultimate goal of almost everyone on Earth is to find out two questions from the aliens, which are ""Why they are here and What do they want?"" Over the course of several months, Ian and Louise communicate with basic language skills with the aliens in order to try and figure out why these twelve spaceships have landed on Earth.<br/><br/>Villeneuve always gives an honest look at how we might react to this, by sprinkling the backgrounds with news pundits covering looting and politicians giving their two cents in. The real underlying story is with Louise and the loss of her young daughter to cancer, which we find out in the first scene of the film. Her coping and flashbacks to her daughter play a key role in moving on with life and trying to find an answer as to ""Why"". The film goes down a brilliant rabbit hole as to why the visitors are here on Earth and what their intentions are.<br/><br/>There is a mix of senses that Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer incorporate throughout 'Arrival' that plays to your pleasures and fears on a very emotional level. You won't see burned buildings or people running and screaming or even the White House being blown to bits here. Instead, you will get an excellent and very original take on the alien invasion that has a ton of heart and soul with some grounded, yet excellent performances by everyone involved. This is one of the top sci-fi films in a long time. <br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"Ar_Pharazon_the_golden","7","1","6","19 January 2017"," Well made, but...
","Arrival is centered around a very interesting concept. How would you communicate with an alien species? How can a scientist approach this contact effort when faced with the impatience and the dictation of topics by the politicians and the general public? The film deals with the issue patiently and semi-scientifically, albeit in rather naive fashion (Amy Adams is the second linguist working on the project, and no one so far had thought of trying drawing/writing? Com' on). The side story with the daughter looks like the most overused cliché in cinema (you can guess ""dead kid trauma"" from the first scene) but turns out to have a bit of a twist which makes it clever. The aliens themselves are interestingly Cthulhoid (just in appearance!), the other countries' attitude towards the aliens does not really drift towards wrong- cause- they're-not-Muricans territory, and all in all the film has no major weaknesses - except for the main plot resolution, which is that the aliens' gift is their language. Which could be a good idea, if understanding their language didn't provide a way to...see the future. Yep. Apparently with amazing accuracy over incredible time periods. How is this a thing? I don't know. But science fiction films which try to focus on matters that regard actual science and more or less realistic issues should probably avoid this sort of interstellar-y mumbo jumbo."
"artmania90","9","1","6","16 January 2017"," Loopholes aside this is an astonishing personal drama... with aliens
","""Arrival"" is the kind of movie I wanted to watch with as little information as possible. The trailer intrigued me and roused my interest: a story of aliens finally making first contact, and our inability to understand them. How that could sustain itself for a 2-hour run time was beyond me, but this (I'm thrilled to say) is a movie full of beauty that just about left me spellbound.<br/><br/>Our heroine is Louise (Amy Adams in what has got to be one of her best roles), a linguist who teaches at a college and lives alone in a glass house overlooking a lake. We learn about her daughter, a smart young girl who died of cancer at a young age. It's a heartbreaking opening to the film, a set up to a story that has more emotion than the sci- fi genre would have you believe. Suddenly, large orbs appear all over the world. It makes the news and interrupts the class with a barrage of phone calls and texts. No one can verify them as man-made, and the locations around the planet seem strategic. This is indeed first contact. People are glued to the TV and buildings are evacuated. I wonder what would happen if aliens ever were to touch down on earth. I would assume this is as accurate as I would imagine.<br/><br/>Louise is contacted almost immediately by a Colonel (Forest Whitaker), who confirms contact has been made with the alien beings, and yet no promising communication can be made. He asks her to decipher an audio clip that sounds as much like a language as a whale's call. It's impossible. Louise confirms that the only way to actually learn would be to have a face-to-face encounter; to teach them the rudimentary words and go from there... You start with the word for ""human"" and end with the answer to the complex question ""what are your intentions here on earth?""<br/><br/>The spaceship is one of the many striking aspects of the film, first revealed in a grand shot in the wilderness of Montana. Fog spills over green hills, and there on the horizon is a black mass 1,000 feet in the air, hovering just above the ground. A military base is set up nearby, and work is quickly underway. The entrance to the ship is a 10-foot hole that opens at the base every 18 hours. A cherry picker raises the crew inside the chasm, and a change in gravity allows them to literally walk up the walls to a meeting chamber. I wonder how they first made this discovery, or who was the first to agree to venture inside the menacing ship.<br/><br/>There is a twist of sorts at the climax of the film that leaves you reeling over the images and moments leading up to it. It still has me scratching my head by the complexity of it, and left me somber at it's implications. This is a deus ex machina to end all deus ex machinas, and yet I was moved by the way it worked out (rather than feeling cheated). The climax ends in a way that could only happen through specific series of events, and if you think too hard about what is happening you will only hurt yourself. How badly I want to ask you questions about the movie, the ending, the aliens (10-foot tall beings that look like upright squid), and the expansive questions of fate and choice. This is a brilliant movie directed by Denis Villeneuve (he made one of the decade's best movies last year with 'Sicario') and the talent displayed is bar-none some of the best filmmaking around right now. The score by Jóhann Jóhannsson is surely an Oscar-contender for it's ease in slipping back and forth between sounds of horror and orchestral moments of harmony. For a film this complex, giving a concise review is hard. It's better to just advise you to see this movie as soon as possible, and perhaps plan ahead to see it twice."

","Short version, okay to wait for renting it, does not demand the big screen....and yes the film is not an action flick, but nice enough to see and then think/talk about it with friends/family. A fine Friday night before dinner film.... The less you know about it, probably the better.<br/><br/>Longer review, mild spoilers included...<br/><br/>My 8th grade boys and I enjoyed this (but the same week, they were buzzing more about the TV show ""People of Earth"" for what it's worth.) Having recently read a book by Steven Johnson arguing on behalf of the more intricate stories in TV shows as a sign of growing intelligence or something like that, it was interesting to see this film, heralded as a smart sci-fi film, but with such a slim story line.<br/><br/>Of course the story line does get a bit curved or warped if you will, and there is a whiff of romance. But I almost felt like this could have been an excellent Twilight Zone (a moment of silence for the failed efforts to revive that classic show).<br/><br/>I did find myself wondering about the 12 different locations (Sudan, Pakistan made the cut along with the US, the UK, Russia and China, so was North Korea left off the list...was it targeted at the top 10 war-torn, or war-friendly??). I also wondered if each arrival came with two 7-footers (not the NBA type).<br/><br/>But the spare story-telling might have been intentional, the vague swirling images of our visitors....and the stellar, scene-stealing soundtrack all could help make less more. Surely the romance tried that inverse relationship, that definitely felt like a jig-saw puzzle missing a lot of pieces. Heck, even when the team visited with Abbott and Costello, they didn't use the whole time allotted? That part bugged me (but of course I also wondered if the aliens were initially communicating to the canary in the dilithium crystal mine).<br/><br/>In hindsight, or is it foresight, could the linguistic relativity have also given Amy Adams' character other flash-forward-backward visions. Opened up new stories to tell. Or made for some 2001 homage montage.<br/><br/>Anyways, the austere atmosphere for everything about the film worked okay, and I almost would like to see a mash-up of an old Obsession TV commercial with the alien interactions. Cloud chamber chic! Because of the more subtle nature of the film, if you didn't catch it on the big screen, I think that is fine (or if you want to save a couple of months worth of Netflix charges....) It was somewhat exciting to see the first shots approaching the alien ships, and the interaction (which you may have seen a little of in previews).<br/><br/>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly I went looking just now for how quickly people could translate such a truly foreign language, and came across this article that I enjoyed, and you might as well.<br/><br/>Hmmm, not allowing the link so it's at slate.com wit Betty Birner, a linguist, from 11/22/16.<br/><br/>Actually she dismisses the ""linguistic relativity"" that I had heard about before, and also it has the name of the theory that I didn't quite catch in the film : Sapir-Whorf.<br/><br/>Lastly I saw some comments in the chat area, and I do think that this T2 film argues for determinism, and that always gives me the free-willies."

","So much going against it, mainly there was not much to it. For a very long time, there's no ticking clock. No tension. No threat.<br/><br/>I went in trying to pay attention because of the mixed reviews and that many said they were confused. I generally wasn't confused although it tried very hard to be such. The ""loose"" chronology was apparently verified by experts, but was sometimes hard to swallow.<br/><br/>The opening was effective on trying establish sympathy for Amy Adams character. But it took me out of such when she didn't age, although the daughter's life probably covered 15 years, at least. Then, of course, we find out that the birth of the daughter had not happened.<br/><br/>Although I enjoyed Adams performance, it really turned out there was nothing to the character. The supposed sympathy card about the daughter was the cheat and it never happened. Sure, she was a brave scientist, but not much else.<br/><br/>Found it jarring that the arrival and lead up to the meeting of the aliens was slow and methodical but then once they met them, we quickly cut to the post-op of that meeting. The tension and anxiety was evident but then the twisting of gravity (because the ship was tall and thin) was just a device and not really interesting.<br/><br/>And there was not much to the rest of the film, where most of the tension (albeit manufactured) of the piece exists. The soldiers get paranoid. The Chinese get paranoid. Although probably plausible in the real world, I just had a tough time with it in the context of a film.<br/><br/>But the concept was very interesting. Shades of Slaughterhouse 5. I had also seen another very interesting time movie called ""Predestination,"" but had a serious paradox. The paradox questions came up with Arrival. Why was she having dreams about a daughter that she never had? Why was she having visions of a meeting with the Chinese general she never had? But I bought it.<br/><br/>But it dropped the ball on what ""gift"" the aliens supposedly gave Earth. And was the daughter what would save the aliens in the future?"

","By now Denis Villeneuve has proved he's master of visually striking and atmospheric films. And 'Arrival' is visually stunning film, and it has a substance. The atmosphere screams upcoming doom and every scene is built up like some big disaster is going to happen soon. It raises many philosophical questions and also tries to answer them (how good are the answers depends everyone's own personal beliefs and philosophy) Many call 'Arrival' thinking man's sci-fi. Within two months I've seen it twice. 'Arrival' is kind of film that makes you think over it (if you like to analyze the meaning of art and life) and it holds up the second viewing. Although the plot twist is already known, but 'Arrival' is built up with edge of your seat suspense and atmosphere, that it doesn't ruin the experience of the second viewing. Describing the plot is quite pointless here as it will ruin the surprise and twist moments of the film, but all the plot elements are glued together masterfully, that the cracks are not visible. One can say that second viewing is even necessary.<br/><br/>Three main actors did terrific job so Amy Adams and Forest Whitaker both deserve an Oscar for their efforts.<br/><br/>By far the best science fiction film in recent years.

","""The Arrival"", directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring Amy Adams, is certainly one of the best films of the year and one of the finest films ever made about the events surrounding first contact with extra-terrestrials. First, Ill state the obvious. As with any Villeneuve film, the photography, score and performances were spot-on. I think this movie accurately depicts how different world powers would approach this situation and executes that perfectly. Amy Adams is more than deserving of an Oscar for her performance and I can honestly say that after viewing this movie only once, I already want to see it again. This film explores several concepts including, the power of language and communication, the theory of time and what it means to leave behind a carbon footprint on this Earth. I can safely say that this is Mr. Villeneuve's finest work yet and one of my all time favorites. This movie is a timeless masterpiece that will resonate with it's audience and have you thinking for a while after."
"annuskavdpol","6","1","6","11 January 2017"," Arrival is like Contact
","This movie Arrival has the feeling of Contact because both movies have a main character that is a middle aged female. In both movies there are a lot of flashbacks and memories and an interplay between now, past and future. The dark oval shaped space crafts looked like the Evil eye in Lord of the Rings, Mordor. And I thought this movie had elements of ET - like the way the base camp was set up and the plastic like uniforms the team had to wear when visiting the alien creatures. At first I thought this was a pretty original idea for a movie, but when I watched the movie further, I noticed that so many Hollywood movies had already experimented and displayed almost all of the parts of the science fiction story line and plot. Mixing in components of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 2001: A Space Odyssey. I guess it costs the directors and film sponsors lots of money to make a movie like this, a couple of million, and the movie needs to be a success in order for it to break even financially. I can sense that Arrival stayed within the status quo of what a Hollywood audience would consider safe. It did not come up with anything evil or scary instead it stayed within the comfort-level of the general film population. What I would have liked to have seen is some brand new original ideas regarding aliens, and the idea that these aliens have a different technique of writing is not different enough in my mind. To me, it means that aliens and humans are more the same then different in their ways of thinking, communicating and processing information. A more original idea would have been something along the lines of a non-verbal but pure sensory communication. Something that could not be data analyzed within the house-hold computer."
"JMCReelReviews","10","1","6","8 January 2017"," Arrival is a majestic, beautifully created piece of cinema that is steeped in melancholy and flows with a real elegance.
","Director Denis Villeneuve has been making something of a name for himself recently for mastering gritty, intense and suspenseful thrillers (see Prisoners and Sicario for example). It was intriguing, therefore, to discover that he has branched out into Sci-Fi here with Arrival, in which 12 alien spacecraft descend on Earth and station themselves at random locations across the globe. True to form, however, Villeneuve delivers one of the most intelligent, creative and insightful Sci-Fi movies of recent times.<br/><br/>In Arrival, a language expert, Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) must analyse and decipher what the aliens are saying. As she spends more time with the aliens, she is haunted by the memories of what happened to her daughter, Hannah, which is revealed in a heartbreaking opening sequence accompanied by Banks' narration as she explains that ""there are days that define your story beyond your life"".<br/><br/>This notion of the predetermined, as well as the recurrence of Hannah, becomes a metaphor for one of the key questions of this story; would you do anything to change your life when you know what is going to happen? Villeneuve manages to enhance this notion further with superb use of imagery. The spacecrafts are colossal, frightening, looming structures that hover above the ground yet are almost featureless beyond their unusual lens-like shape. The aliens are huge; so big in fact that we only ever see their bottom halves. Both designs serve as a reminder that there is a much bigger force at play affecting our lives. Meanwhile, Villeneuve creates an element of mystery behind these shapes and designs; what is inside these strange, hovering objects? What do the aliens look like in their entirety? In providing the audience with visual reminders of the unknown, Villeneuve also manages to imply that whilst our stories may be 'defined', we don't necessarily know how or why.<br/><br/>If there is one flaw with Arrival, it is a minor one in that as it reaches its conclusion, we discover the real reason why the aliens have come to Earth. Whilst the build up to this point is intelligently and exquisitely formulated, the basis of their purpose feels surprisingly weak and short-sighted. Ironically, despite the film being so adept at developing the theme of life being already defined, it perhaps needed to be another 10 minutes or so longer so that the audience could obtain some degree of closure on the impact of the aliens' invasion.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Arrival is a majestic, beautifully created piece of cinema that is steeped in melancholy and flows with a real elegance. There are plenty of comparisons to be made to this, including Interstellar and Inception (the spacecraft tunnel scenes are very much reminiscent of the latter), and also Gareth Edwards' Monsters. However, Arrival feels that bit more taut, succinct and complete, almost effortless in its delivery and more profound with its message.<br/><br/>For the full review and other movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"

I thought this film was going to have the action and suspense of ""Contact"", which was actually good, but it didn't. The story is actually a good one because it wasn't your average extraterrestrial or alien film. As far as the acting goes you couldn't have asked for a better cast to do the job. Forest Whitaker, Jeremy Renner, and Amy Adams were exceptional! I just wish there talents could have been displayed in a better film. Other than that there's nothing I really can say about this film.

","Unfortunately when I saw it last night I was asking all of the same questions because quite simply, the movie did not make sense. In her opening monologue she is seen with her daughter speaking about how rough things are in the present state. To begin, this is the first time the movie tries to trick you into believing the daughter has already died. Second, in talking about how ugly this is, why would you choose to have this kid with the scientist when you know the genetics will lead to a rare condition resulting in death? I would not wish that on any child. My girlfriend saw the movie with me and tried to make sense of it, saying that altering the future could have a domino effect that could lead her to not have talked to the Chinese diplomat. There's a problem with this theory as well, she already obtained the information and used it to calm the Chinese Military and time IS linear. I was also extremely upset with the music selection. It was downright annoying at most parts of the movie, and I have read that the movie has been disqualified from the Oscars because so much of it was copied from other movies. It seems very unlikely that she is the only person on earth, apparently, that can see the future but oh thankfully she is chosen to speak to the aliens and, oh, what a coinky-dink, the aliens no she can see the future too!!! The relationship with the scientist was extremely forced. After solving a global issue, I generally feel like the ""I know that I was supposed to meet you"" line did not work for me regarding their relationship. Then all the forwarded cut scenes leading to ""let's have a baby""... I don't buy it. Again, if she knew her actions would leave the child fatherless why not tell the scientist WAY in advance what she had been seeing and not drop that bombshell on him. Hell, I'd be running from that crazy bitch too. The scientists conclusions from when our main character had fallen asleep and he figured out the 3D structure involved time seemed really ridiculous and scientifically speaking, I can't make any legitimacy of it. Why the hell was the bird there? The damn thing was so go damn annoying. Others told me that they thought the bird could talk to the alien but when was a single time you saw the alien address the bird? The damn thing went ape. Talking of poor cinematography, it looked like they continued to use the same shot of the bird flying from one end of the cage to the other over and over!!! Seriously!?!?! Finally, yes the idea of time travel is, as others are frequently mentioning, the key point the movie has emphasized... by accident. I don't have to reexplain how damn awful they messed up playing on linear time is, as many other redditors have clearly done so, but it was absolutely pathetic. I left the movie shaking my head ""No"" at this film."

","2016 has been a pretty odd year for the most part, but for the characters in Arrival the year is going to get even more memorable as their world has itself some alien visitors. Starring Amy Adams and directed by Denis Villeneuve, Arrival keeps the director on a good streak, remaining without a bad feature film under his belt, while also paying homage to Kubrick's 2001 as evident by the orange spacesuits and the curvature of the hospital corridor in the films opening sequence. Lets hope Villeneuve' influence and streak continue with Blade Runner 2049. Please God.<br/><br/>This film for the most part is a rather enjoyable aliens-arrive-on-earth movie. A team of scientists and language experts are brought together by the government to attempt to make contact, it follows basic plot conventions and plays as the most realistic and logical reaction America would have to an event like this (other than opening fire immediately). So for the most part the film is an enjoyable viewing of evident plot conventions.<br/><br/>However this is not all there is to the film. No sir. The film focuses mainly on language expert, Louise Banks played brilliantly by Amy Adams. Adams' performance in conjunction with Villenuve's heartfelt and realistic construction of the character are a winning combination. Right from the opening sequence you already feel for Louise and are drawn to her as she is established beautifully in an opening montage that meets the ranks of Disney's UP. A short sequence but one that brings great emotion and establishes the protagonist extremely well.<br/><br/>As well as a well established lead the film also has a well executed narrative progression. Events progress naturally and questions that both you and the characters have been asking finally get some answers. Thankfully these answers don't disappoint at all, in fact they will blow your mind. Take my word for it that is not an understatement. So please go watch it and tell them Dan sent you.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the only issue with this film is that it peaks just a bit too early. Once all questions are answered and the film has hit its peak, the film then continues on and gradually starts to decline a little before the credits actually roll. There is a particular sequence with the Chinese President at a party which I personally felt to be simply ham-handed and thus almost ruins what was a very enjoyable and intriguing film.<br/><br/>Overall, Arrival is fantastic sci-fi film with a slightly ham-handed finish but that is largely forgotten about thanks to Amy Adams great performance and Denis Villeneuve's masterful directing. A must see for fans of the genre and film fans. Now that's a proper introduction."

","Dennis Villeneuve delivers - the kid is good!<br/><br/>This is the intellectual kind of sci-fi, the kind that takes its time, that makes you think, that tries to bring the genre and thinking forward. The language angle is fascinating and fun to explore. <br/><br/>Amy Adams plays the linguist fantastically well and Villeneuve's decision to stick the camera 95% on her is incredibly strong at building tension and a connection with the character. The opening scene where you actually don't see the aliens arriving but simply Adams' interaction with the world reacting to the arrival is simply fantastic.<br/><br/>There is only one issue with the movie: purpose of the aliens. Without spoiling it's hard to get into but the conclusion is a little light for the aliens let's say to remain vague<br/><br/>Other than that, fantastic movie, worth a couple of screenings!"

","Louise Banks (Amy Adams in the role) is a linguistics Professor. She appears to be living alone leading a quite life devoted to her profession and teaching. Occasionally she recalls vaguely memories of a young child growing up and playing with her.

Banks discovers their enigmatic language (based on circular rings) and learns an unexpected truth about time and her own life.<br/><br/>I liked very much this film. Not your average sci-fi adventure. It is a deeply personal movie about the essence of time, loss and rebirth. Based on a short story by Ted Chiang it tells us a lot about time in our lives and how language signals can give meanings and sentiments that can mark our existence for ever."

I really enjoyed the scenes where she and the other personnel approached the spaceship. Also, the process with which they went about communicating with the alien species.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie though, it became a little bit cheesy. I thought the music was overly sappy, and they kept cutting to sappy memories (this isn't a spoiler so don't worry) and romance and ""the human experience"".<br/><br/>All in all, a solid movie-going experience. Makes you think quite a bit. This is a movie you will end up reflecting on at least during the drive home. Maybe you will end up talking about it with friends and family.

"JimD73","7","1","6","7 December 2016"," Arrival's human elements outshine its speculative ones
","Arrival is the kind of major Hollywood movie some sci-fi fans have been eternally asking for. It's a story of alien vessels descending on Earth that doesn't present itself as an excuse to blow up the White House, or immediately turn into a cheap thrill ride. Its main focus is on something technical (linguistics), and it doesn't immediately turn into faux-mathy quantum-this relativity-that technobabble but instead lets it drive the plot. It involves nations colluding and high stakes, yes, but it also is consistently a very personal story that never loses sight of its main character. It leaves plenty of room for imagination while not resorting to magical excuses. But something's still missing for me. Arrival is a sparse, thoughtful, beautiful film that I just can't love, mostly because it's payoff simply didn't entirely work for me. To go on much further would be clearly spoiler territory, but suffice to say that the movie doesn't cheat with any twists nor does it betray its tone. In fact, its payoff is incredibly affecting dramatically. While the viewer in me interested in human stories left satisfied, the world- investigating nerd in me felt a bit let down.<br/><br/>Arrival's sparsity and humanistic elements come to the forefront immediately, starting with flashback's to Dr. Louise Banks' (Amy Adams) daughter dying young, and allowing the landing of the aliens to happen entirely offscreen. We only see what Dr. Banks sees, and only get a full-out effects shot once she's brought in by the military as a linguistics expert. Twelve crafts have landed sporadically around the world, and while Dr. Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) try to figure out just what they want, they must work with the other eleven nations while also staving off aggression towards the visitors both foreign and on their base. It's timely that international mistrust plays such a large role here, considering the current nationalistic trend in politics, but Arrival mostly shies away from that form of commentary. It has more sympathy for the aliens themselves, and condemns those who see mystery and respond with fear. Alt-right- esque commentators make brief unsavory appearances, panic spreads through a literal game of telephone, and when Renner notes that they're having ""Coffee with some aliens"", it's possible to mishear as something very politically relevant today.<br/><br/>For all that it has to say about how we treat those deemed ""other"", Arrival is more interested in it's sci-fi elements than its political ones. And while they don't entirely land for me, they take big swings and hit home emotionally. A lot of it's successes have to do with its score, beautifully subdued and often incredibly sad, and Villeneuve's command of mood, painting the movie in a washed-out blue haze on Earth and surgically cold blacks and whites on the vessel. Its alien design is fairly minimalistic, with the gravity- bending trick seen in the trailers as its lone flashy moment. Otherwise, it's content with its giant black obelisks of vessels, remarkable for their unremarkability. Amy Adams gives a career-best performance in the middle of a fantastic career, important as the movie rests entirely on her shoulders. No amount of disappointment in the end result can erase the fantastic buildup, and if you're able to go with it all the way, the reward is memorable and touching."

What comes to mind? Alien? Interstellar? Blade Runner? Matrix? Inception? Yes! I am talking about such conceptual brilliance in a movie. And Arrival passes it with flying colors - sometimes so overwhelming, it surpasses the benchmarks too.<br/><br/>Coming straight to the script - the beauty and realism of a protagonist who is unperturbed by the commotion around regarding an unknown event, sets the tone of the movie. Unlike in-your-face surrealistic heroism, the people with knowledge tend to be realistically unaware of the happenings - especially when such an extra-terrestrial event takes place. <br/><br/>The design of the space-ship and its locales are just so haunting and mind-numbing, it translates from the emotions and mannerisms of the actors in the movie to the audience seamlessly. Same goes with the design of the aliens which is unique in its own might, and reminiscent of the haunting originality of the Alien franchise. But what takes the cake - is the graphic language of the aliens which is so unique and interesting - one may never even fathom such creativity. All of it while the earthlings were unable to communicate via the audible approach being used by the aliens - another realistic incidence of such a contact!<br/><br/>It is not unrealistically snappy as it takes the protagonists hard work and time to even begin to comprehend the subtleties of the alien linguistics, and the translation is mostly lost. This is one of the best representations of such a scenario, as one does not simply create a dictionary for a species in a day. Not to forget the other subtle but important precedence of various alien ships landing in various parts of the world - and not only in America (a hilarious joke among non-residents of USA). <br/><br/>This movie is haunting and beautiful on so many levels : The music is numbing and characteristically ""alien"" which transcends the various fears and emotions of the characters into the audience without trying too much. The visuals are mind-boggling and overwhelming - reminiscent of Alien and Interstellar, but more subtle, haunting and less heroic. The story itself with its great twist (a trope of Shyamalan) and the concept of time ( like Interstellar), has a beautiful philosophical and emotional value, almost unseen in the majority of science fiction flicks.<br/><br/>The best quality of this movie is that it subtly takes away from the alien event, and rather focuses on the emotions, consequences and life-changing transformations of the earthlings and the people surrounding the event. It does not make the aliens the incident of importance - but rather a process which changes and focuses on the conscience of the human race.<br/><br/>Let me warn you though - this is not a movie for the audience who want snappy and action-packed entertainment from a science-fiction movie. In some parts, the movie is rather boring, as it delves deeper into the comprehension of the event, and in the end, it is just plain acceptance and moving on - there is no big climax waiting to happen. Also, to add to the frailty - the CGI in some parts of the movie is questionable, considering that it was such a well-made movie with high production value. <br/><br/>It may seem like this movie tries to borrow from franchises like Alien and Interstellar, but in the end, it creates its own unique world and manages to shelve away any such comparisons- thus creating an original idea and sci-fi masterpiece altogether. It is a fresh addition into the big names which redefined the genre of sci-fi easily sitting beside Matrix. Blade Runner or Alien. <br/><br/>Verdict : Brilliant and redefining cinema, and one of the masterpieces in science fiction. 4.5/5<br/><br/>P.S : The movie is based on the short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang which was the winner of the 2000 Nebula Award for Best Novella as well as the 1999 Sturgeon award."
"Hellmant","9","1","6","16 November 2016"," Reminds me a lot of the 1997 sci-fi hit 'CONTACT'.
","'ARRIVAL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The new critically acclaimed science fiction drama, about an expert linguist that leads a US military team in trying to communicate with alien invaders. The film was directed by Denis Villeneuve (who's helmed such other critically acclaimed hits as 'SICARIO', 'PRISONERS' and 'ENEMY'), and it was written by Eric Heisserer (a veteran horror flick writer of movies like 'LIGHTS OUT', 'FINAL DESTINATION 5' and the 2010 'A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET' and 2011 'THE THING' remakes). The script is based on a 1998 short story, by Ted Chiang, called 'STORY OF YOUR LIFE'. It stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg and Tzi Ma. The film has received rave reviews from critics, and it's been a big hit at the Box Office. I think it's a sci-fi masterpiece. <br/><br/>12 alien spacecrafts touchdown around the globe, alarming the entire world population. Louise Banks (Adams) is an expert linguist, that's selected to lead a special U.S. military team in trying to communicate with the extraterrestrials. She's joined by a theoretical physicist, named Ian Donnelly (Renner), and a US Army Colonel, named Weber (Whitaker). The team engages in a desperate race against time, to find out why the aliens are here, before violence erupts around the world. <br/><br/>The film reminds me a lot of the 1997 sci-fi hit 'CONTACT' (which was one of my favorite films released that year); it tells a similar story about alien invaders, with a similar strong lead heroine character that's trying to make 'contact' with them. Adams is amazing in the lead role, and Villeneuve's direction is superb. The movie is a little long, and slow-paced in places; but for the most part it's very engaging, and intense, and the ending is absolutely breathtaking (I cried). It's definitely a sci-fi masterpiece, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/191482784"

It reminded me of the first time I saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". I hope so much the studio will release an extended DVD version with at least 10 additional minutes explaining the ending a lot better. It would also be nice if they could better explain why the aliens are here at all. It seems like it was a complete waste of the aliens time and effort trying to communicate with the cave-man like human race - compared to their obvious technology."
"Dachi1994","10","1","6","4 December 2016"," gewesen gegenwärtigen zukunft
","I will not start talking about the details of the script I will talk about those parts, which I think are harder to understand. Main hero of the movie is Louisa, linguist, who is in a depression because of the death of her daughter. Louisa is nihilistic towards the world but ""there are some facts in the world, which you can't evade and you can't shut your eyes on them"". This kind of fact for Louisa is the arrival of aliens on earth. Louisa is elected to communicate with them, because she is the best linguist of country. Louisa establishes contact with aliens, which give her some kind of gift. By this gift Louisa starts to see the future and some illusions start to come to her concerning some child. At first personally I thought that this is a child that she will have from Ien in future (and it really is so), but I thought that this is her second child, that she will gave birth after the death of the first one. But it's not that easy. Actually Louisa has only one child, that she will have from Ien after aliens leave earth and which also dies in the future. But here arises several questions. Before the arrival of aliens Louisa is in depression, for the loss of her daughter, it seems she already sees the future and feels the pain of a loss. How can Louisa see the future when she hasn't yet received this talent from guests? How can she see the future before she has received this vision? <br/><br/>This case is not the one that might be beyond logic. Thing is, that the gift that is conferred from aliens provides such a possibility. Talent received from them is not that you can just see the future, it's essence is that you can perceive your existence as a whole. Existence of a human is of this kind, it exists in a wholeness, we just haven't have an ability to perceive it as such. Time for a men is not a whole, it is divided and torn. But Louisa is conferred with an ability to perceive it in wholeness. Consequently, nonetheless, that she received this gift for example in 2016 this doesn't mean that she couldn't have used it in 2010. On one moment of her life she received the talent to perceive this life in wholeness and thereby it turns out, that she always had and will always have it. According to the nature of this talent she has it already, before she received it in her torn time. By the spoiled, human time this is impossible, but this is possible, for a true, whole time. <br/><br/>Not only human time and human person is torn, torn is also human language and humanity itself. Humans can't hear each other, can't talk to each other. Fact, that humanity talks in many different languages is only an expression, that humans can't communicate with each other in inner dimension. When I say that humans can't understand each other I don't only mean that they can't understand each other, because they just speak in different languages. In a camp where there was participating representatives of twelve countries everyone could understand what others were saying, there was an ongoing translation and there were many professional linguists, nonetheless they couldn't understand each other, all the twelve stations refused to communicate, humanity has divided. This happened exactly because they couldn't hear to each others inner, spiritual voice, no one has seen another as a whole being, as a person, but everyone was competing with each other and in spite of an outer unity internally everyone tried to surpass and defeat the other, to say short they didn't love each other. <br/><br/>Why exactly Louisa? Why did aliens award exactly Louisa and not someone else? Perhaps this is not accidental. As we know Louisa is a linguist and as it turns out the best one in her country and maybe in the world too. As I said, lingual separation is an outer expression of the fact, that humans are separated within. But Louisa, owing to her knowledge, had best of all restored this outer separation in herself. By knowing a language, by speaking in it man ""restarts his mind"" and in this way he unites different cultures. Maybe this all was a prerequisite that she could also overcome her inner separation and for Louisa's effort that was expressed in the knowledge of languages, she was chosen as an addressee of a gift. I think more essential and significant in this movie is something different. In a dialogue with Louisa aliens tell her, that they are helping humans, in order that humans will help them in future. How can humans help beings that surpass them with such a level? Certainly here is not meant nothing material i.e. nothing that you can take away by force, physically. If it would be this way they would need nothing to teach or give away as a gift, they would take it away from humans without a single contact. it seems they need from humans, that, which those latter will achieve when they will exist as a whole, only after overcoming the division in a human reality. It seems that they can be helped not by the human existing by body and matter, as they appeared before them at the present, but by the one who exists by soul and spirituality, like one they see in the future. Cosmos, aliens, god needs a help of a human, but of a whole man, which means not the corporal one, that speaks with a language of a weapon and power, but the one that speaks with a language of love and peace. Prototype of this man in the movie is named Louisa, who overcomes the division of time, and sees future as present of a past, that is gewesen gegenwärtigen zukunft."

","It is so cliché that drama movies put a child dying from cancer or a rare disease in the big screen. And then a bunch of people question why a child is supposed to die young? How can God or any power in this universe allows that to happen? Well, I am not so sure cancer and some other diseases are that random and caused by anything but a combination of bad habits and bad diet from parents, their parents' parents and I can't say how far that could go. People are smart enough to make all sort of financial plans, save for mortgage, cars, but when it comes to plan a ""life"" they forget that genes are passed on. And maybe there should be some sort of ""bad luck"" but I think that's a lame excuse. People who eat what they wanna eat, drink what they wanna eat and do whatever they please totally ignoring that information is available and most everybody knows a diet rich in fat, sugar, sodium, salt, fried and fast food just to mention some, also no exercise at all, these are the recipe for disaster. Bad genes are passed on. Maybe it will skip a generation or two, but fatally it will get to someone sooner or later! So, do your part and stop blaming the cosmos for your acts.

","Excellent!The tension between hard science solution [ represented by the physicist] and the Humanist language/communications expert. We saw this film last Wednesday, and by chance had seen ""Contact"" just the week before. The two films, made years apart , have a natural affinity and make a good progression. It was so nice not to be spoon fed obvious facts and details and not to be needlessly spooked and frightened.The cheap special effect and pyrotechnics of lesser films are totally missing here.Rather, thoughtful conjecture about what ""aliens"" might be.What they might want. What they may want to tell us. The interlacing of time and place is mesmerizing and I would strongly recommend this film. This is a film that viewers will return to, perhaps many times, to see how the time elements are developed. Well done! This thoughtful science fiction is a credit to the genre."
"peefyn","9","1","6","3 December 2016"," Beautiful, scary and realistic
","The last sci-fi movie about a linguist I can remember seeing, is Stargate. And that movie didn't even attempt to seem realistic. One of Arrival's great feats is presenting linguistics in a (close to) real way, and making it really interesting. The same is true for its approach to other sciences. The time they have spent making it feel and seem accurate pays off really well.<br/><br/>The science has gotten quite a bit of attention, but it's not what I liked the most about the movie. The highlight was how (scaringly) it depicts the world's reaction to what happens in the movie. It's terrifying, and it's the reason science fiction as a genre is so important. It gives us a (possible) reflection of a side of us that we hope we don't ever have to face. Because I can see countries reacting as they did. And citizens. Uprisings, panic and fear, all spiraling out of control into a unbearable situation. The movie is not filled with this, but it's in the background and in the back of your head throughout the entire film, and it's scary. It's almost like I wish everyone would see this movie, so we would know better.<br/><br/>The concepts explored are all very interesting. Humanity's reaction, as mentioned, but also the scenes showing first contact and how it is handled. This is not a movie with a big twist, but it does hide something that is hinted at, and that pays off well in the end.<br/><br/>It's also visually a very interesting movie, and the soundtracks fits it really well."

Because one or more or all of them must have affected my enjoyment of this movie, because I thought it was OK, but nothing special - when it seems everyone else thinks it is a master piece. To be honest, I even closed my eyes on a couple of occasions. It suffered from taking a very short story and trying to stretch it into nearly 2 hours. Which naturally creates huge empty spaces which need to be filled with something more than just beautiful scenery or empty dialogue. <br/><br/>The language angle was good - the possibility of misinterpreting messages and intentions. But at no point did I sense any jeopardy from making any mistakes. Even if the humans attacked the ""Aliens"" where was the certainty that they would retaliate? There had been no previous show of aggression. In fact ""jeopardy"" was lacking in all interactions. We see a previous person being carted off after interacting with the aliens - what happened to him/her? When our guys interact with the aliens I sensed no risk or threat. So why the predecessor had to be carted off is beyond me.<br/><br/>And of course it committed the cliché of depicting America as the world's peace keeper, China as the world's aggressor and Russia as the brutal nation which executes one of their own. <br/><br/>And then there are plot holes:<br/><br/><ul><li>Are we really expected to accept that these ""aliens"" suddenly arrived completely undetected in their approach, placed themselves in 12 apparently random locations (that happily included America) and then spent months in dialogue with lots of so called linguistic specialists, none of whom could have enough common sense to work together. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They came to us to give us a gift and yet made it almost impossible to communicate it? Surely if they had the power of foresight they would've known that communication was key and would have worked something out? And what will be happening in 3,000 years that we will help them out with?</li></ul><br/><br/>Like I said in my summary, maybe it was too clever for me. Maybe I need to see it again to ""get it"". But frankly I have no desire to sit through it again."

"TheFilmFreak1","7","1","6","27 November 2016"," Arrival Left Me Frustrated
","2016 has been an awful year, in both the cinematic realm and the real-life one. With virtually no above average blockbusters released save for 'Civil War' and the second 'Conjuring' movie, I hoped that one of the first mainstream movies designed for the upcoming awards season would provide a respite from this year of idiocy. It did, but not to the extent I had hoped it would.<br/><br/>The first act of this film is, quite simply, exceptional. Denis Villeneuve plays up the mystery and tension of this scenario - which in many ways resembles the first act of Independence Day - to levels of true excellence. We do not get a proper glimpse of one of these alien crafts until the moment our protagonist Dr. Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams) sees one first-hand, at which point we are treated to a wonderfully composed long shot of the bizarrely shaped vessel levitating above a green, mountainous expanse of land as a truly haunting leitmotif for the alien presence plays. Subsequent scenes expertly maintain the tension by staging the first occasion Banks boards the ship, joined by theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (played by Jeremy Renner), with near Kubrickian precision and pacing. The 2001 parallels are inescapable here, and indeed very welcome, as such an occasion as this can only rightly be played for every moment it's worth.<br/><br/>The second act then rolls in and turns the movie into a puzzle story, as our heroes try to figure out exactly for what the aliens are intending to do on Earth. It's arguably the 'funnest' section of the movie, and it is certainly the most interesting. At this time of increasing divisions, people trying to figure out how to successfully communicate with someone else seems like a very prescient story to tell. The trailers have already spoilt their initial answer, but I will not. What I will say is that it rather rightly has the people of the Earth perturbed, although I still insist the reactions of many of the world's governments to the answer was frankly schizophrenic. Still, a solid second act that proceeds an exceptional start.<br/><br/>But then the third act begins, and the screenwriter rather inexplicably develops a seething contempt for his audience. Up until this point, we have been treated to flashbacks of Banks' past traumatic experiences with a child who died of cancer and a vicious divorce that followed soon after. They were not particularly well-directed scenes, and I felt their presence as shorthand for character depth only succeeded at lessening the film. Well, certain revelations occur about the nature of the aliens' language that, shall we say, cast these scenes in a different light, and with that the film suddenly explores a concept that I had not anticipated that it would explore at all, nor really wanted it to, upon entering the cinema. This is a spoil-free review, so I won't tell you what it is. I will give you a hint, though; Christopher Nolan covered it rather recently, and it is a concept that is infamous for allowing characters to be quite literally handed the solutions, having done almost nothing to earn them.<br/><br/>I applaud the film for dealing with this concept in this particular way, and hope it will interest people in exploring the theory behind it, but this intellectual adventurism comes at the considerable cost of narrative tension and plausibility.<br/><br/>I loved so much of this film, but by its end, it had let me down, and I cannot give it anymore than 7/10 for that grave sin."
"NotTheOne000","6","1","6","27 November 2016"," Ersatz intellectual sci-fi that thinks it's deeper than it is
","On paper, I should have loved this film. Slow-paced sci-fi with little Blockbuster action, based around well-drawn human characters... what's not to love? Well, first the good. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is good too. It's a very well executed piece of film-making in many regards, and will be loved by many cinema goers.<br/><br/>However, the film has one big problem.<br/><br/>The essential component of any good ""soft"" science fiction story is that it allows us to examine the human condition in novel ways. Through the use of allegory, we can take apart our real-world behaviour and examine it in a new light. District 9 does this, Moon does this, 2001 A Space Odyssey does this (though you have to read the book to see it properly), and Ex-Machina does it particularly well. This film fails completely.<br/><br/>Arrival presents one very big ethical dilemma (which I won't reveal) and then dismisses it pretty much out of hand, failing to address the real emotional challenge and the genuine moral conundrum it poses. Worse than this, it ducks the dilemma by invoking gender stereotypes - women are unable to face hard decisions and will passively sacrifice themselves to their soft, fluffy feelings and end up going with what was meant to be, while men will react to any difficult situation with anger and stone-walling to the point of damaging their relationships because, you know, that's what men do. There is no challenge to this behaviour, no revelation that it doesn't have to be this way, no attempt to suggest that actually women can make the hard choices or that men can have a deeply compassionate side that reaches beyond the ""me man, me protect"". The characters do not take a personal journey, and do not learn anything about themselves at all.<br/><br/>Given the main character is a woman and that her relationship with her male companion is so integral to the piece, it was extremely disappointing to have what should have been the core of the film treated with so little consideration and given so little screen-time and so little gravitas. It's as though someone put a red pen through the most interesting and important scenes (I have not read the original story, so this is quite possibly what happened), or some film exec saw how well Interstallar was received and thought ""yeah, lets find us another one of those"" and grabbed the first clever-looking sci-fi script that crossed his path.<br/><br/>There has been comparison with some of the great sci-fi movies of the past. This film is no-where near as ground breaking in terms of its ideas or as rich in terms of the depth of its characters as those classics. It does not challenge us, it gives us the same old clichés and is more interested in the big reveal and the cleverness of its premise than the implications of these things. The film lacks authenticity, preferring to dazzle us with its assumed smarts than address the difficult questions. The irony is that if the exact same story had been told in the form of a Blockbuster, it would have been much more fun without losing out on any of the ideas! Disappointingly, only 6/10."

","There has been one late year sci-fi drama a year for the last 3 years in Gravity, Interstellar and The Martian. Arrival is this year's and it's better than them all IMHO. Arguably the best alien scifi since Carl Sagan's Contact. It might not have the same level of graphics as Interstellar, Martian or Gravity having been made in less than half the budget of either one of them (I- 170$M, M- 110$M, G-100$M, A-50$M). But it's makes up for it with a better parent-child relationship than Interstellar, making linguistics interesting just like The Martian made Science interesting, and had a better story than Gravity in general. Director Dennis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners) once again showcased his ability to tell complex stories in a simple to understand at the same time keeping it intriguing. Amy Adams had the most work to do with the entire movie being told from her point of view and will deservedly get an Oscar nom for her role.

","While most sci-fi involving aliens has de-evolved into ID4 or that horrible sequel The Arrival is a breath of fresh air. The writing, acting, directing is all at the level of top film making. At the core of the story it's not about alines, world destruction or any of that BS, it's about a personal story (Amy Adams) her journey through this event has you on your toes the entire film. <br/><br/>The learning of language and what the aliens want is just a set-up for an emotional gut punch I'm still thinking about days later. This is how sci-fi should be done. One of the closet film I can think of is Contact - even thought I think that this is a much better film. The ending will have you reeling for days afterwards but the reason why is because it leads you into the next part of the story and makes you think about what is to come next, which all great sconce fiction makes you do."

","This is not your regular science fiction movie, that is for sure. aliens are coming in 12 locations, nations are scared, alarmed and eager to know the ""purpose of these beings"" while being highly skeptical of ""destructive motives"" which is more or less an instinctive reaction to something that we don't understand. And then, in a very smooth and unexpected transition, comes the notion of language, time, how they are related and how we interpret things and act based on our perceptions, motives, understanding etc..We are usually used to look at the ""shape of things"" or at ""first layers"" and this is exactly what the movie is telling us not to. Aliens, foreigners, ""different beings"" is only the first layer of a very complex and humane message (that I do not want to spoil for you). This is a movie for people who dig for layers, enjoy cult-like imagery, and do not mind thinking about the movie and its message long after the final credits.

I am glad that he goes back to the weird twists that Enemy has with this one but they don't quite hit home to me like Enemy.<br/><br/>The film is very very slow and methodical in it's pacing, and while it may seem like it drags on at points, I never felt bored with the film. My intrigue only grew as the movie progressed and you started to see progress in both story lines. I was glad that they focused on the human aspect and stayed away from any kind of alien action sequences. <br/><br/>The slow discovery of the film reminds me very much of 2001 A Space Odyssey as I've seen many other reviews stating and it's a very similar film. Many movies nowadays fail to deliver discovery/mystery in a way like this. <br/><br/>Now everything in the movie is put together in a great way but the whole payoff for the aliens and their purpose and how integral Adams is to everything just isn't that great. The twist hit home really well but once it is revealed you put all the pieces in place fairly quickly if you were paying attention and the film drops the ball by not throwing a few more. <br/><br/>Overall it's a gorgeous film with wonderful pacing. I may be acting like an adrenaline junky by requesting more twists but I feel the buildup could've allowed for a little more to the ending."

","Arrival is an exploration of time in both thematic development and the film itself. Through its subtle complexity, the movie revives the sci-fi genre (hopefully) into an intriguing addition to dramatic cinema.<br/><br/>The screenplay carries the film through strict adherence to the plot and theme, unfortunately disregarding character development. It is absolutely stunning in the application of the theme of time in a carefully orchestrated plot. The directing only works to supplement the thematics, causing it to be effective, but preventing any show of truly exemplary direction. The cinematography is similar in its support of the themes. However, both the directing and cinematography cut away from the performance of the actors, leaving Amy Adams in an empty spotlight and the supporting cast in the shadows.<br/><br/>The plot itself leaves the entire effect of the film through its thematic development to be grasped in the final moments. Although the ending is moving, it leaves the audience behind due to the quick transition in pace from slow to fast and the expectation of their full understanding.<br/><br/>Thus, Arrival succeeds in its subtle development of time, but forgets to leave enough time to finish.<br/><br/>8/10"

","What a beautiful story. Different than any other movie I have ever seen. The story unfolds and surprises and makes you wonder all the time what is happening. The actors are doing a great job. However, when for 80% of the time I am looking at 95% of the screen being out of focus I am not happy. The movie has no light, everything is gray and with the only focus being on the back of the head of Amy Adams that does not work well for me. There must be other ways to tell a story in a movie than by blurring the entire screen. The story and acting are overwhelmed by the irritations and disappointment. After ten minutes in the movie I really wondered if I should walk out and forget about it. The story line kept me in."

","A more than decent SF film which goes for the intellectual approach and ideas instead of explosions and guns, and gets quite emotional in some scenes without becoming silly. Actually, there was one explosion, which was not necessary - the reason behind it was probably to raise the tension but I thought the human/alien meetings were strong and strange enough to do without additional scares. The communications by glyphs was a good idea for a visual medium.<br/><br/>The military angle of the operation was rather cliché, and I didn't understand why they didn't use the good old field telephone instead of radios when faced with communications problems.<br/><br/>I adored the spaceship design, especially how they took the common UFO-like lens shape and played with our perception habits by simple turning it by 90° - cute ""twist"".<br/><br/>At the heart of the movie is Amy Adams, she carries it with ease and is completely convincing, every single other role is just necessary padding."

","I watched Arrival last night. First I couldn't comprehend what is being said, shown and experienced. It would take a good day or two to digest all the information. Might even need to watch it 3 or 4 times to get it fully! With that being said it is one of a kind in the sci-fi genre. Actually it is a mix of sci-fi, drama and spiritual genres. <br/><br/>What I liked: Amy is awesome. She has done a brilliant job with her acting. She delivers a great performance in every scene that makes the viewers 'feel' what that character felt and 'live' the experience with her.<br/><br/>Music is incredible. The music is not too dramatic or too low, it mixes and merges with the visuals. The music/hums inside the spacecraft puts one in an alien environment/world.<br/><br/>The idea of the movie: The concept of this movie is quite new and different from other sci-fi movies. 'Time is not linear, and thinking in the aliens language might eliminate time and there by eliminate misery' This is actually a Buddhist philosophy, also a quantum physic principle. Great idea!<br/><br/>Room for improvements: Jeremy didn't play much of a role. Though the movie is centered around Amy, he could have had some strong character. In other words his character could have been made 'deeper' that it was, at least half-deep as Amy's!<br/><br/>The alien's look could have been improved! We have seen this kind of octopus looking aliens in a lot of Hollywood movies. It could have been like a smoky or less rigid form that can change shapes!<br/><br/>Overall, its an awesome movie.

So much so that I feel as though this has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The movie is a thought provoking thriller. The movie captures the attention of the audience with the scenario of Aliens landing on the planet earth. The movie depicts a world where many citizens are fearful of humanity, many countries are defensive, and a select few scientists are trying to get answers. <br/><br/>Through the narration of a linguist, the movie uncovers a deep and surprising story. Many scientists all around the world are trying to figure out what the intention of the aliens are.

","Arrival is an alien movie that has very little to do with aliens. Its chiefly about a depressive linguist named Louise who is chosen to attempt a translation between the aliens and the U.S. military. However, I think many audience members will digest this movie with very little remembrance paid to the extra terrestrials. The important events take place in the psyche of Louise, which reveal themselves to us only in the final moments of the film. (Going forward there will be spoilers).<br/><br/>First the bad: There are some irredeemably corny lines (mostly from Jeremy Renner's character) that are significant, they lessen the dramatic tone at critical plot points. There are also some scenes where characters are transparently stilted or behave irrationally. Forrest Whitaker's character, for one, is either understated or entirely dispensable. The acting on the whole is forgettable, but never awful. Adams performs well, though her emotional volume is pretty uniform all the way through - which is not necessarily inappropriate. The story is not exactly about her growth as it is about her accepting her own peculiar mind. <br/><br/>Yet Arrival succeeds in ways that are more important. When the twist comes at the end it suggests several things about Louise and about people in general. For one, our reliance on a linear narrative, or on a narrative-period to give our lives stability, meaning. We ignore obvious clues that the film's prologue is actually its epilogue, mimicking the denial that Louise likely lives with throughout the life of her child who is destine to die. <br/><br/>It speaks to the greed or craving for optimum human experience. Louise, for whom its implied lives a rather muted life (which is ironic) before the alien landing, gets an unprecedented opportunity to talk with the aliens. Then they reveal to Louise her gift, to see into the future. In that future, she see's she'll have a child - and that child will die in her twenties. Yet she has the child anyway (without telling the father of her premonition). She has the love affair, the celebrity status, the family by the lake, and indeed all this ultimately disintegrates as she knew it would. <br/><br/>Alternatively, or maybe in conjunction with this, her behavior can be explained as follows: Louise realized she had no free will and surrenders her attempt at controlling reality, and thus finds some measure of happiness. Similarly, Louise maybe recognizes that life is hopelessly fragile, futile even, but decides the moments of both breakdown and beauty are still worth experiencing in full. <br/><br/>To summarize: Arrival is thought-provoking in ways many big-budget Sci-Fi's don't even try to be. There are many other strengths in cinematography and sound that make Arrival solid. Enjoy."

","Another alien invasion movie you say? Haven't we all seen this before? Close Encounters, Independence Day, War of the Worlds.. etc. They came from the heavens, and they either want to help us or take over the world. What's the big deal about Arrival. See it for yourselves, and look closer. Something utterly fascinating has been achieved by Denis Villeneuve, who is now a three- time hit maker. It's all about communication, and the meaning of life. A linguist goes through a journey of interpreting the peculiar written language of the alien creatures, which sort of resembles the Rorschach test. She discovers along the way that she can see into the future, and foretell what happens in her life long after the aliens leave.<br/><br/>The film is something to behold. Villeneuve does an incredible job directing once again, with outstanding cinematography by Bradford Young and a masterful score by the GREAT Johann Johannsson. Amy Adams is as breathtaking as ever in the starring role, accompanied by great performances by Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whitaker. It's a head scratcher, and that's a good thing indeed."

","Arrival is a well filmed, interesting, and thrilling movie that's ending is a tad too confusing. Arrival follows a young, and attractive, language professor, Amy Adams, who has recently lost her daughter. Shortly after her daughters death she's recruited by the army to translate the language of some squid like aliens that recently landed on earth. The aliens have landed all across the world and each country is trying to understand what the strange creatures are trying to tell us. After a few hard days of work, Amy starts making some real progress but the other countries believe the aliens are trying to give them a weapon to kill their enemies. Fear of a weapon causes all of the countries to stop communicating their findings to the other countries. Fear and panic spreads across the globe about this ""weapon"" the aliens speak of but Amy thinks they meant something else.*!*!*!(Spoiler, look ahead for the spoiler over message)*!*!*! After visiting the aliens one last time to speak, she finds out that the weapon is their language. After one learns to speak it, time isn't linear. She uses this knowledge to go into the future where she has saved the day. In the future sequence, the Chinese commander thanks Amy for calling him right before he nuked the aliens by calling his private number and telling him his wife's dying words. He then proceeds to tell Amy this information. Amy now is back in present day and calls up the Chinese commander and tells him his wife's dying words *!*!*! (Spoiler over)*!*!*!. While movies like Inception or Shutter Island have semi confusing endings that make you think. Arrivals ending seems silly and confusing just for the sake of being confusing. Besides a semi poor ending, Arrival has great CGI and cinematography. The aliens and their ships are massive and creepy yet interesting. The camera is usually focused on Amy while blurring out the background to show that the alien's language is always on her mind and she is always thinking about it, rarely caring about what's going on. Overall, Arrival is an enjoyable movie that's well shot, has an attractive protagonist, a bad ending, and cool CGI. It won't win any awards but I would definitely suggest watching"
"TruthTwentyFour","7","1","6","21 November 2016"," The disappointment you feel when you see a good movie that could've been great.
","SPOILERS!!! Remember the Martian? Yeah, the book was way better than the movie (surprise surprise), but for the sake of comparison I'll use it as an example to kind of flush out what I found obviously, and some times painfully, missing in this film.<br/><br/>Remember when all of the scientists got together to figure out how to get one guy home? There was some cool ""working the problem"" scenes that pulled the viewer into the story and the technical problems they had to over come and surmount. You felt like you were ringside in solving a mystery.<br/><br/>There is none of that here. The entire U.S effort basically boils down to just two scientists working the problem, which I find highly improbable. Yeah, they introduced her team when she first got there, but that was pretty much it. You didn't see much of that ""team"" after that, batting the ball around and solving a mystery. Nope, it was pretty much a one person show. Implausible.<br/><br/>Remember in the Martian, when they showed government officials, and how this problem went all the way to the top. Not here. All you see is one Army Colonel running the show. So yeah... This is the biggest event in World history let alone U.S. history... maybe perhaps spend 5 minutes extra camera time in this film, on the how the higher up's are working the problem? Implausible.<br/><br/>And then there is the communication amongst world powers. Here's a really good question. Do you really think we're going to stop talking to our allies, comparing notes and working the problem, just because a few Nations went silent and cut off communications? The screen goes blank with the U.K. in solving this mystery, just because China and Russia's screens go blank? No way. This is way too big for this weird cut off of communication, especially from our allies.<br/><br/>Also, I don't buy for a second that those soldiers would have, let alone could have, sneaked a bomb on the spaceship. With something this big they would have had Navy Seals in place following orders to the letter. They explain this action because one of them sees an internet broadcaster--weak tea. And then they're going to bring guns and shoot their fellow soldiers. Right.<br/><br/>Outside of that this movie was great. It was just too bare bones. I can understand what they were doing here. They wanted to strip the story down, trim all of the fat, so you could just focus on the main character and the evolution and realizations that grew into learning how to communicate with the Aliens. Grew in fact into a great Sci-Fi twist. That part was awesome. But they threw too much overboard, stripped to much off and tried to shed to much weight, and the movie foundered because of it.<br/><br/>It's ironic because this film is intended to be a Sci-Fi thinkpiece. And yet any thinking person out there, who maybe figured out the twist a few minutes before their friends did, was also subjected to some fairly big believability holes that could have easily been filled out.<br/><br/>So... Good film, that should have been Awesome!"

","I didn't go into this film with high expectations, however I was really shocked by how good it was. I hadn't done any research on it, or even watched the trailer. I was expecting it to be another film that just has massive explosions, constant violence and no story. However, the film was very different. It didn't waste any time at the beginning, and within 6-7 minutes got to the main story. From then on, it was taken very slowly, almost a bit too slow, therefore the film could have been cut down by about 15 minutes. However, as the film went on, it became even more clear what was happening. Everybody assumed that the beginning sequence was set before the main film, but it was actually in the future! And finding out that Ian is the father was an unexpected surprise! I would definitely recommend this film to anybody that likes sci-fi films. I am sure I will re-watch this film at a later date!"

","A sci-fi movie that assumes there is intelligent life in the cinema is something of a rarity. ARRIVAL reworks themes from other movies - notably 2001 and CONTACT - but it reworks them with a fresh perspective that makes this movie seem intriguing and original.<br/><br/>Shell-shaped spacecraft arrive at various locations around the globe. The US one hovers over a field in Montana which quickly becomes a military zone like Area 51. Linguistics expert Amy Adams is summoned to try to communicate with the octopus-shaped aliens who squirt their words onto a clear wall that separates them from the scientists and their military escorts whom they allow inside the craft.<br/><br/>The big question, of course, which occupies the entire movie, is: Have they come in peace? With (fond!) memories of MARS ATTACKS and WAR OF THE WORLDS, I was constantly anticipating mayhem. In the Pentagon (clearly not presided over by a Bush or a Trump) the doves, for once, are not silenced, but around the world the hawks squawk the loudest, inevitably.<br/><br/>The CGI here manages to be stunning without being over-the-top. Adams gives a nicely judged performance which justifiably dominates the movie. The story lacks pace but it delivers on thought-provoking content. Probably, as in 2001 and CONTACT, most of the audience will come out wondering, What the hell was that all about? Good: get 'em thinking. Treat us as intelligent beings - like the tentacle people!"

It's cleverly left up to the viewer to stay engaged and slowly make sense of it all.<br/><br/>The alien creatures and their method of communicating is exquisitely conceived and visually portrayed, as is their own alien ""humanity.""<br/><br/>The portrayal of how various world leaders react to the alien arrival, and how these leaders interact with each other is a sadly accurate commentary, as were the scenes of the media riff-raff stirring up angry and violent sentiment.<br/><br/>One point deduction: The too oft repeated mother daughter scenes were gratuitously sappy, were an unnecessary distraction, and didn't add value to the story. <br/><br/>One of the very few movies that earns/begs a repeat viewing for full comprehension.<br/><br/>A masterpiece?

"bkrauser-81-311064","9","1","6","12 November 2016"," Smart, Cerebral, Emotionally Affecting and Fascinating
","A thought occurred to me while I was watching Arrival, the latest in a long tradition of alien-invasion films. While basking in the film's visual splendor and wrapping my head around it's multitude of character detail and narrative ebbs and flows a voice murmured; ""this is why you go to the movies."" How a movie of such unabashed intelligence and subtlety managed to get made today is beyond me, but for those in dire need to reaffirm their belief in unity and the angels of our better nature, look no further than Arrival. To put it bluntly, this movie is a marvel.<br/><br/>The film begins with twelve alien spacecrafts appearing as if out of thin air above various places around the globe. In response, the United States government dispatches a research team headed by Colonel Weber (Whitaker) and experts Louise Banks (Adams) and Ian Donnelly (Renner) to investigate one of the landing sights in rural Montana. The mission: find out what do they want? Why are they here?<br/><br/>Immediately we're brought into the head space of Louise Banks, a preeminent linguist, charged with communicating with the alien race. The creatures - always presented in a white fog and separated by glass, seem to lack verbal communication. What they do have is a written language which they scrawl across the glass in circular patterns for Louise to decipher and understand. ""You approach language like a mathematician,"" says Ian in a moment of admiration. Indeed, she solves the various puzzles embedded in their language with considerable efficiency, all while shes being haunted by bitter personal memories and visions.<br/><br/>Throughout her illustrious career Amy Adams has always managed to find muted stoicism and fascinating truths in her characters. Starting as a bit of an opaque audience conduit, Louise slowly reveals herself as the keenest mind among her peers. She drinks it all in, every physics bending moment and every bureaucratic setback; considers her options and makes the wisest choice. All the while, we as the audience are right there with her, hanging onto every understated modulation of her voice, hoping that her reasoned arguments will win the day.<br/><br/>And she has a lot to go up against. As she struggles to learn the visitors' purpose, research teams across the globe argue among themselves, coaxing government and military brass closer towards war. Even members of her own unit begin to fear the worst when the creatures begin to use the word ""weapon"" in their parlance. At one point we're given a literal time-clock which may not be as white- knuckling as the border shootout in Sicario (2015), but nevertheless keeps us glued to our seats. A nearly impossible task when considering the film's plot is essentially ""let's sit down and talk it out.""<br/><br/>Arrival draws immediate comparisons to Contact (1997) and Interstellar (2014) which become all the more apparent when the third act reveal flips the narrative upside down. I dare not ruin the big plot twist lest to say unlike those other films, Arrival doesn't contort itself to appear smart. It simply is smart, trading in half-realized notions of physics into real questions about how we communicate and how that communication can wire our thinking. In so doing the film becomes a foolproof and unique sci-fi chamber piece that is simultaneously intimate and epic while leaving audiences with plenty to talk about afterward.<br/><br/>Much of that dichotomy is molded by director Denis Villeneuve whose discipline, attention to detail, symbolism and lighting can be best compared to David Fincher. While many directors may try to clutter the tale with eye-popping visuals, Villeneuve realizes that he can create a sense of grandeur with simple geometric shapes and color choice. Yet what sets Arrival apart from David Fincher films (or for that matter any of Villeneuve's other films) is its cautious optimism. If ""cinema is a tool to explore our shadows,"" then Villeneuve seems to be saying underneath all that darkness there is still a sense of communion; a solace in knowing we all share in anger and grief as we do happiness and awe.<br/><br/>Arrival is a smart, cerebral, emotionally affecting and fascinating sci-fi film whose grandeur demands to be seen on the big screen. The acting across the board is fabulous with Amy Adams once again turning in a masterful performance worthy of recognition. The direction and the story are nearly flawless in their construction and execution. Not a single frame is wasted nor a single plot thread left un-sewn into this mind-melter of a movie. Watch it; then watch it twice."

","Some viewers may object to the descriptor ""time-travel story"" because there is no actual travel, at least not spatially. But this narrative explores the very sticky problem of (mental) navigation through time in a non-linear way. Supposing you could see the future and, in doing so, you could use that information to affect the present. This is what Louise Banks learns to do, by learning the language of aliens who experience time as a continuum (as opposed to the linear flow of time's arrow, the way humans generally perceive it). Note that she can affect the present, but not truly alter it.<br/><br/>Therein lies the philosophical problem which is not explored here. Unlike the 'Terminator' or 'Back to the Future' franchises, where ""the future is not yet written,"" here the future is set and unalterable. How do we know this? Because otherwise, Banks has no reason to trust what she's seeing. In this scenario, she has no free will. While we can appreciate the difficulty in expressing such a thing in film, the realization that future events are determined takes the steam out of decision-making. In fact, with time as an unalterable continuum, all decisions are already made. The beauty and mind-bending thing about all this is that such a universe may very well be the one we live in."
"Bangell153","8","1","6","16 November 2016"," Brilliantly made; emotionally, but not intellectually satisfying
","I was incredibly excited to see this movie from the moment I saw the trailer - it promised to be a return to intelligent, intellectual sci-fi. And while the film delivered on that promise for most of its run-time, a sloppy ending to the sci-fi plot(no spoilers ahead) required and received partial redemption from the emotional punch of the film's finale.<br/><br/>The ever-brilliant Amy Adams plays a linguist tasked with communicating with strange alien craft which land in 12 locations across Earth. I always love watching glamorous Hollywood stars attempt to play academics - but Adams succeeds in being convincing. Her acting really holds this film together, and from the beginning to the end her subtle performance was spellbinding and occasionally tear-jerking. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker play their supporting roles ably.<br/><br/>The visual design of Arrival is one of its strongest aspects, because it's hit upon the fact that in the modern age of special effects, sometimes less is more. The 'ships' themselves are huge but featureless, and their strange nature is established not through a visually overwhelming special effects sequence, but by a simple cinematic trick where gravity is 'flipped'. By keeping the visuals simple and straightforward, Arrival in fact enhances, rather than diminishes, the 'alien' nature of its subject.<br/><br/>Most of the film concerns Adams' attempts to communicate with the aliens and understand their language, while tensions around the world build as different populations and governments take different attitudes toward the aliens. The process by which the humans and aliens begin to be able to communicate feels realistic, without any glaring Hollywood 'aha!' moments, and seems to take an appropriate amount of time. The political ramifications of the situation, while frequently alluded to, are not really explored in great depth, and some may feel that the film misses an opportunity to really have something to say on this topic.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the way the sci-fi plot is resolved feels incredibly rushed, unsatisfying, and unrealistic. Sadly, people were even laughing during my screening at how conveniently things are wrapped up. Because so much of the preceding run-time had been dedicated to a very detailed, patient exploration of how communication could begin to be attempted, it felt jarring for the resolution to be so rushed. Ultimately, the film is concerned less with these matters, or with the geopolitical situation, and more with the emotions of its main character, and the window onto the wider human condition which she provides. In this respect, the ending is a triumph, so bursting with pathos that one struggles not to feel profoundly moved. Like all great sci-fi, Arrival takes a fantastical concept and uses it to reveal something very real and very human.<br/><br/>Arrival is not a perfect movie. The political aspects of its plot are too insufficiently explored for it to make a real statement. The personal, emotional storyline is extremely moving, but perhaps should have been more tightly focused on throughout the whole movie rather than the technicalities of inter-species communication. But Arrival is a bold movie, fantastically made, which packs an emotional punch and treats its audience with respect. May this ambitious film usher in a renewed interest in thoughtful sci-fi; and may Denis Villeneuve continue to go from strength to strength."

By that I mean it's quite slow. <br/><br/>But it's beautiful and crafted and emotionally engaging. The Aliens that arrive on earth in 12 seemingly unrelated locations do not appear to be warmongers, but are they? What is their motive? To find that out humankind will need to collaborate globally in finding a common language or means to communicate.<br/><br/>That's gonna be tricky when three of the countries involved (Russia, China and Pakistan) are not commonly associated with collaborative political working (a bit too much Cold War/Axis of Evil rhetoric here for my liking) and indeed these are the three countries that prove most troublesome and potentially trigger-happy in the plot.<br/><br/>Throughout, I was wondering what would happen here if this was real and Donald Trump was in office. It doesn't bear thinking about frankly.<br/><br/>Anyway, thankfully for humankind it's Amy Adams as a poly linguistic professor called Fiona that's in charge of negotiations with the Montana located spaceship full of Heptapods (7 legged floating Octopi). Beautifully and sympathetically rendered.<br/><br/>Her accession to the post is a direct result of her in depth understanding of the Sanskrit word for war and its meaning (A desire for more cattle) unlike her potential competitor.<br/><br/>(Blink and you'll miss that.)<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker recruits Adams, playing a passable General in charge of alien negotiation, and Adams is joined in her quest by mathematician Ian played in a nicely understated fashion by the always excellent Jeremy Renner.<br/><br/>But this is Adams' movie (she's a n increasingly class act) and it's obvious why she is receiving Oscar nods (I doubt this is a winning role though).<br/><br/>Like everything about this understated movie the cinematography and special effects are designed to seduce rather than excite, but for me Bradford Young's Dickensian lighting underwhelmed rather than understated.<br/><br/>Johan Johannson's music is a big plus. It underscores beautifully and clearly takes some cues from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Indeed this is the movie that it most resonates with; that and 2001 A Space Odyssey.<br/><br/>The back story of Adams' life has a brilliant twist that uncoils slowly but surely and makes the whole a deliciously complex tale to unravel. <br/><br/>It's worth it in my opinion; but not my companion's, who opined that it was ""two hours of my life I won't get back, even if Jeremy Renner is nice to look at"".<br/><br/>Way above average, thoughtful, slow moving but grown up sic-fi.<br/><br/>Just don't expect Jedi forces."
"The_Stoic_Minion","7","1","6","15 November 2016"," An interesting take on a very common theme
","Despite the marketing suggesting the idea that the film is more of a thriller, Arrival is actually more of a psychological drama centered on humanity. <br/><br/>Amy Adams plays Louise, a linguistic professor, who is enlisted by the Army to communicate with an alien species that mysteriously arrived on earth in 12 ships spread across the world.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve whose previous films I haven't actually seen but he definitely seems like a capable director. His style resembles that of Christopher Nolan due to his use of minimal lighting, shallow depth of field, and epigrammatic storytelling. But just like Christopher Nolan's films, sometimes the story can get weighed down by all of its complexity.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is, in my opinion, the strongest section. The director does an excellent job of approaching this common story of aliens in a very pragmatic way. We feel the uneasiness of the sudden situation that mankind finds itself in. When Louise is approached by the Army and becomes involved, we understand her desperation to be a part of it. This eventually leads to the first contact, which was an incredibly suspenseful collection of scenes. But once that moment finally came, the rest of the film started to feel sluggish. <br/><br/>The bulk of the film is Louise attempting to tactfully communicate with the aliens in order to ask the big question: What is your purpose on Earth? The problem is that despite how interesting it was to see how a linguist would break down a language, the film comes to an absolute stand still. There is montages, narrations, and random visions that push the story along but the scenes felt dragging and out of place. It isn't until towards the end that everything starts to pick back up again. Once the big question was finally answered by the aliens, I found the outcome quite grandiose. Then when the twist came, despite figuring it out beforehand, I felt like I was misled. Don't get me wrong, it connected everything. But in the end I just didn't really understand certain character motives. <br/><br/>Even though the film has its share of small flaws, Arrival is still deserving of a watch."

I honestly think the less you know about this film before you see it the better it will be. It is superbly acted in particular by Adams who so much of it rises and falls. The film is superb at showcasing the flaws and the strengths of the entire human race. It follows a similar suit to many films of the genre, in that the fate of humanity seems to rest on a couple (but mainly one) unassuming hero(ine). That is where the clichÃ© ends. I found the whole thing much more believable than the majority of 'Aliens have landed' films. It was emotional, incredibly human and totally believable...to a point.<br/><br/>As the title says, there is so much that 'Arrival' does right but the scientific theory behind how the whole resolution is reached is largely nonsensical and a bit silly.<br/><br/>The notion is nice but it was just a leap too far for me to get on board with.<br/><br/>After that blip in my viewing delight though I was thrust back into the film.<br/><br/>It ended with me asking moral questions of myself, trying to empathise with the main character and admiring the choices that they make, whilst still wrestling with the question 'What would I do?'<br/><br/>A really good film that I felt utterly drawn into."
"evan_harvey","7","1","6","15 November 2016"," Interesting, but not fascinating
","All the reviews said this was an amazing film about big ideas and concepts. Well, there's really only two ideas/concepts. There's the aliens and why they're here (pretty standard stuff at it's core) and then there's the the two leads (this one is a bit more interesting).<br/><br/>I really hoped to come away from the film with some things to mull over, but found that it was all pretty straightforward. The ideas were interesting, but not engrossing.<br/><br/>It's a much more minimalist style of sci-fi, which really works well. The sets are pretty sparse, the locations are kept to a minimum, and it manages to capture a few moments of reflection amongst the confusion of dealing with aliens.<br/><br/>The theory that language shapes how we think is an interesting one, and this film makes a great platform to explore that. This theory is still largely unsubstantiated, and while this film doesn't really challenge that, it does play along the same lines. Language is just a tool though, and it can't truly be isolated (from other factors such as culture, up-bringing etc) to the extent that the theory suggests. Otherwise all people who speak a particular language would see the world exactly the same way, which is clearly not true.<br/><br/>The ending feels a bit rushed, and there's a particular moment (when saving the world) that I felt was a bit lazy. It didn't fit in with the rest of the story.<br/><br/>Other reviewers will claim that the main character goes through a journey of self-discovery, but she really doesn't. Her character doesn't actually change at all during the film - this is the real indicator of whether there has been any self-discovery. There's no actual self-reflection, nor any real questioning of what makes us human (this isn't addressed at all). There's the usual fear of aliens etc, but it's presented in a flat two dimensional way.<br/><br/>Other reviews have crazy headlines like ""Arrival is a stunning science fiction movie with deep implications for today"", except, of course, it really doesn't have any implications for today, as it's a sci-fi film about things that will never (in the foreseeable future - pun intended) happen.<br/><br/>I think the real problem is that so many modern films are weak and rubbish that when a film with even a hint of something more profound come along, people go gaga over it.<br/><br/>It's okay, and it's interesting. It's a welcome change from the blandness of Marvel films, but it's also not a profound as the reviews claim."

","While this genre is generally not my thing this movie is a step upward. Golden Globe winner, Academy Award Nominee Amy Adams is the reason; an actress who elevates everything she is associated with. On a purely visually level the 2 hour movie is dark and pops of color are rare which is clearly for a reason. No doubt it will provide more questions than answers and it appears to be why it was made. This movie could provide a much needed anthem for the world. The themes of humanity (good & not so great), language, death, science, compassion, love and memory are explored. Most people will only recognize two other actors; Jeremy Renner and Academy Award Winner Forest Whitaker."
"Irie212","7","1","6","15 November 2016"," ""Always in motion is the future..."" --Yoda
","Since this film is about humans being stuck in linear time, let's take first thing first. The premise: Aliens arrive in 12 ships, posted around the Earth. A linguist, Louise (Amy Adams) is recruited to go to the Montana location to help communicate with the heptapods (as these squid-like creatures are called). Joining her to head the project is a physicist, Ian (Jeremy Renner).<br/><br/>When Louise begins to decipher Heptapod B, the aliens' written language, she also begins to see flashes of her own life-- glimpses that the audience naturally assumes are memories: random scenes of her with her daughter, Hannah, including a conversation about her separation from the girl's father, and a scene of Hannah dying when she's still a schoolgirl. <br/><br/>But no, these are not memories, because it turns out Hannah did not exist before the aliens arrived. She is the daughter of Louise and Ian, who meet at the alien encounter. (Many reviewers, including Anthony Lane at The New Yorker, got this wrong. His review refers to the glimpses as flashbacks, but then admits he ""hasn't worked it out yet."")<br/><br/>The key is the heptapod language, a kind of alien code that allows those who understand it to see the future but-- and this is also key-- not the *whole* future, and perhaps only your own future, at least not until you're fluent in heptapod. Louise gets glimpses of her future as she learns heptapod, and when she realizes that, she concludes that the aliens arrived to deliver their language as a gift: the ability to perceive nonlinear time, to glimpse the future.<br/><br/>She's half right. It is a gift to humanity, but the heptapods arrived, on what could well be a suicide mission, with a much bigger purpose. They're desperate. As Louise eventually learns, they have seen the future of their own civilization, and know a catastrophe is coming. They're here because they will need Earth's help.<br/><br/>The aliens and their perception of time as nonlinear is not developed. We learn little about them. Instead the basic theme-- communication as an aid to survival-- is explored through Louise, Ian, and their doomed daughter. The film has a lot of impressive CGI and sci-fi trappings, but at its heart, it is a family drama and-- to a greater extent than is needed, I think-- an action picture with rioting citizens, rival nations, and a bull-headed military.<br/><br/>It may be peevish of me, as someone who likes robust science in their science fiction, to wish there were less family drama and more about Time/Spacetime. But this is a thoughtful and well made film, powerful in places, and quite often suspenseful. I applaud the filmmakers for providing an escape from the question that arises when time becomes nonlinear-- If you know what happens in the future, are you free to prevent disasters? do you have free will?-- by giving Louise only glimpses, and random ones. She never sees the immediate future, so she doesn't know how the alien arrival will be resolved. Therefore she take a grave risk (which I won't reveal, because I still don't quite understand why or how she did what she did) which stops a military attack on the alien ships.<br/><br/>Now that I've written this, and thought about it, perhaps ARRIVAL deserves a higher score. I must see it again..."

","This is one of those films that will clearly divide people into two categories, the ones that love it and the ones that.. err.. meh it? I, unfortunately, fall into the second category. It was a beautifully crafted movie, with great acting, yet it made me feel almost nothing and I left the theater without learning anything new.<br/><br/>So is it a waste of time? Certainly not. Amy Adams does a great job of portraying the aloof linguist that is called to communicate with aliens and the visual design of the film is quite pleasing. The gimmick is also interesting, and I am not going to spoil it here.<br/><br/>The problem is that the film is based on a short story and it shows. Other than the mood and the acting and the gimmick there is nothing else but empty atmospheric space. Reminded me of Melancholia that way, another movie that I absolutely hated but many said was wonderful.<br/><br/>So, bottom line: clearly better than average, but is it a masterpiece and the best film of the year?

"swilliky","9","1","6","13 November 2016"," Beautiful Science Fiction
","A beautiful and ambitious film, Arrival hit theaters this weekend with a remarkable story and stunning visual effects. Based on the short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang, this film directed by Denis Villeneuve shows the potential of thoughtful and complex science fiction. Viewers are introduced to Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) as she raises her daughter through a rapid montage that ends in tragedy. The haunting photography from cinematographer Bradford Young adds to the emotional impact.<br/><br/>As the story moves ahead, aliens arrive in strange and large pods that can only be entered during certain time intervals. Louise is recruited by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to decipher the alien language and figure out their purpose. With the help of theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), they enter the pod and begin to communicate with the spider or squid-like species. <br/><br/>The effects are amazing and awe-inspiring but the story is more personal and touches on themes of language and the development of one's brain during the process of learning. It also explores time and knowledge of the future reflecting on the choices we make and how we perceive the events of our life. This film is an example of great writing meeting great directing with stellar acting on top to make for one of my favorite films of the year that is both moving and entertaining. <br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"piratezippy","9","1","6","13 November 2016"," An sci-fi for the intelligent!
","No Spoilers!! First there are films that make you think, and then there are films that preach to its audience. This is one from the former not the latter. Remember when you watch films like 'Shawshank' or 'the usual suspects' You think 'wow what a twist!' you think 'dam that was clever'. You think. I will not say that this film is up to that standard of greatness, but close. One of the smartest films in recent years that have come out of the studios. There is no wham bang crash wallop to this film; this is not a star wars/independence day type alien film. This is Kubrick-esque. So what's this film about? Not the aliens. No, it's about nature of humanity. Jean-paul Satre would enjoy this film. It is existentialism to its core. Amy Adams delivers a realist performance, and is supported well by Jeremy Renner. Forest Whitaker, such an underrated actor. Plays the military leader of reality, not gun-ho asshole. Again a subtle supporting role, allowing the lead and story take lead. Some say Adams carries the film well, but she has to carry the story, there is no other way the film would work. She would be my vote for best actress when award season starts. The photography is high quality, whether FX, or natural or mixed, it adds to the mood, feel of the film, not overpower it. This leaves the room for the viewer to think, absorb the information received during the telling of the story. The sound/score is balanced and well used (except the final 14 seconds, hence 9/10) I loved this film, it was right up my alley and you leave the cinema thinking, and maybe emotional. I laughed when leaving, as I heard a few kids say 'I don't get it'. Well this isn't star wars kid! This is intellectual sci-fi. This is 2001. This is Blade Runner intellect. This makes you think! To be honest I would say a film that is maybe a bit too clever for under 16s and a slow pace that the x box generation might find too slow. But if you can think, then go and see this film, I am glad I did, and I am still thinking about it."
"burlesonjesse5","6","1","6","12 November 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Arrival
","Containing a numbing, techy soundtrack, made for the widescreen, and distributed by Paramount Pictures, Arrival (my latest review) chronicles the modern day event of mysterious spaceships touching down via twelve different places in the world. With the U.S. Military being baffled by said event, a team of scientists (played by Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner) are assembled to negotiate with the extraterrestrials to find out what they truly want. Question: When did Earth's denizens become so darn afraid of alien species? That's what I asked myself a half hour into this 116-minute flick.<br/><br/>Anyway, in relation to Arrival, I have never seen a science fiction vehicle take itself so seriously, so pensively. Semantic symbols, decodes, language translation, mathematics, etc. In truth, I thought I was watching a high school film strip or secretly conducting a science project for Mr. Wizard. Who knew large spacecraft looking like half- eaten pistachios, could so profusely churn the mind's eye.<br/><br/>Now Arrival with its jumpy narrative and ode to the workings of a Pink Floyd music video, is directed by Denis Villeneuve. And as with his moderately successful Prisoners, no one does dark and dim quite like Villeneuve. Discarding violence and death by penetrative lasers, he tries to reinvent the close encounter wheel here and comes up with the first sci-fi, art film since 2002's Solaris. He also creates a thinking person's Independence Day as well. In certain scenes, Villeneuve uses rack focusing to capture various shots. Occasionally, he goes panoramic with other shots. He likes to mess with you, to have you linger, to turn the tables on your understanding of what manageable storytelling is.<br/><br/>His Arrival at first, feels slow, educational, and even a little pretentious. In the second half, it digs deeper. Flashbacks upon flashbacks, manipulation with the audience's perception of time. Arrival in the end, doesn't really project itself like a film about alien invasions. It unwieldy turns into a character study for one Dr. Louise Banks (played with nerve ending efficiency by Adams).<br/><br/>In hindsight, my speculated cognizance of Banks, is that not only is she a linguist but she can also see into the future (spoiler). When you start to ask questions about her, the movie ends rather frustratingly and on a sad note. Therefore, I didn't come out of Arrival thinking it was a flat out masterpiece. However, I know that it's the type of cinematic peppery that I just have to see again. Rating: 2 and a half stars."

Trump's Red State voters are stuck in the 1900s, listening to AM radio all the time. In the two weeks before the Election, perhaps the most popular radio show--COAST-TO-COAST--was quoting and discussing all the hacked Wikileaks from Hillary's Right-Hand Man, John Podesta, and his insistence that ALL the terabytes the U.S. Government is concealing on Our Alien Presence would be dumped on the General Public Hillary's First Week in Office. Leader Trump and the Red Staters KNOW that the Wall Street Clowns (not to mention the citizens of backwards countries such as Canada, France, and Germany) CANNOT HANDLE THIS TRUTH!

","I haven't seen such a poor plot Sci-fi like ever. Even Star Wars movies are better Sci-Fi than this. Anyway, the whole movie tells a story of aliens who came to earth to give the ""gift"" of how to see future. The aliens can't talk our langue, but they do have their language of signs. The protagonist learns their language in time and somehow this makes her see future. Anyway the goverments want bomb the aliens, so protagonist stops them, she simply says something to war general which only he knows, but she only learns this by seing the future. It wouldn't ever happened unless she knew the future, which makes it a paradox, a very bad one, this is the worst cliche plot hole a time travel movie can make, so obviously this is a bad time travel movie. Also the whole movie protagonist sees future events 1. without firstly even knowing the language 2. At the end of movie it's supposed to be a plot twist (You were supposed to think it those were memories) but since those ""memories"" showed a child and a romance with the dude which she obviously during the film met for the first time and the fact that the child was never brought up to the plot or conversations in any way makes it was obvious that those ""memories"" were future seeing.<br/><br/>Anyway this movie fails at everything, the characters are weak, whole movie is slow and boring and plot is so full of plot holes that this movie doesn't even deserve to be called a Science Fiction. One of the worst movies I've ever seen."

If you're not into meaningless movies, and like to think, you cannot afford to miss Arrival."
"bhnmt61","7","1","7","22 February 2017"," flawed film still worth seeing
","I went into this film expecting something along the lines of Contact meets Close Encounters meets Independence Day, and instead found something very different. Now that I've seen it, the film it reminds me of most is Sixth Sense, where the last few minutes entirely re-maps what you think you've just seen. Arrival has plenty of flaws-- the Jeremy Renner character is woefully underdeveloped (and what exactly does his team DO?), the Forrest Whitaker character doesn't seem to serve much purpose, and as many other reviewers have noted, the method used to learn to communicate with the aliens is just silly--although to give them a little bit of credit, they do give the impression that what we are shown is only the tip of the iceberg of the round-the-clock work that was going on.<br/><br/>But if you can let all that go, this film isn't really about aliens at all. It's a meditation on grief and pain and the limitations of human knowledge. If you knew how much pain was in your future, could you bear to face it? If you knew how something would end, would you still go through it? It's heartbreakingly poignant.<br/><br/>Also want to add that I am not much of an Amy Adams fan, primarily (and oddly) because of her lightweight voice. It suited the princess role in Enchanted perfectly, but in every other role I've seen her in since, she's seemed miscast. So I was not expecting to appreciate her in this film. But by the end she had won me over. I can't think of another actress who could have played this role.<br/><br/>So, yeah, it's flawed. There are tank-sized plot holes (as there were in Sixth Sense), and either they ignored huge swaths of what would really happen in an alien invasion, or (to give the film-makers the benefit of the doubt) they chose to leave that stuff off-screen. But it's still worth seeing: fabulous mood-building, solid acting, great soundtrack, thought-provoking and touching story."

She no longer experiences her thought's as we would in a linear fashion, but is now able to relive and experience the emotions involved before they physically occur.

","*SPOLIERS* *SPOLIERS* *SPOLIERS* *SPOLIERS*<br/><br/>Really a wonderful look into linguistics and how our native language affects and (as the film argues) limits our worldview. Also conceptually reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five. Beautifully shot, and an example of the fact that aliens probably wouldn't all land in NYC or LA or Paris or Giza. The Montana location is truly stunning. The acting is great, and the story moves along quite well for an alien sci-fi film with minimal action. The thoughtfulness that went into the design of the aliens and their society is refreshing (especially as compared to the highly sexualized anthropomorphised aliens in too much fictional media). But it is really the conceptual complexity that left a mark on me. Films that provoke such deep critical thinking are rare, and this stands out. It's also lovely to find one that has big-budget VFX and production value."
"sadovskajana","7","1","7","12 February 2017"," Nice story, very much predictable and a few illogical conclusions
","Very easy-going movie full of emotions, great for relaxing. Mainly because of the reason that it is super-predictable and after first minutes the spectator can easily predict the ending. Despite this fact it is worth of seeing.<br/><br/>I have few questions which were not answered in the conclusion of the movie (mentioned below). I admit that the idea of living the life that you know how will end up sounds romantic. But truly, when you know that your husband will separate from you because of your secrets and your first child will die, why not to have more kids and share the truth from the very beginning?<br/><br/>Louise could give a birth to Hannah, but she could have 1,2,3... more kids just to be sure that one of them will survive and to be honest to her husband and not to die like an abandoned old woman."

","As often happens, I feel at pains to respond to all the negative reviews I'm reading here...<br/><br/>I should first point out that I read the Ted Chiang book that contains the source short story this movie was based upon. The book comes highly recommended, and Chiang doesn't consider himself a science fiction writer.<br/><br/>All the elements in the movie are almost exactly the same as in the book. I say this, so as to highlight what some deem as poor alien design. It's always a tricky thing to pull off, especially since there are no confirmed sightings of actual aliens. In my mind, anything goes, but in this case the Heptapods were on the page before the screenplay was written.<br/><br/>Again, the dialog, ""Do you want to make a baby?"" is straight from the book. It's explained that this comes after two years of marriage, so it's not intended as a lame pickup line.<br/><br/>Someone even had issue with a lack of apparent government involvement. Seriously, do we need another movie with the president making all the actual decisions on screen. Government interaction is implied by means of common sense. We really don't need to see what 11 governments are up to directly. That would be boring.<br/><br/>I guess these things were lost in the movie. I tend to enjoy movies that leave some of the story unexplained in detail. Books get away with this with prose and narration, and movies often don't have enough screen time to go into the same level of detail. I tend to turn off my common sense radar for movies like this. First and foremost, it's intended to be entertainment. And, if you're busy sighing and complaining about these elements, you're missing the point of the story."

The stupid aliens arrive with their technology which is 1000 times more advanced than ours, yet we manage to defeat them easily..<br/><br/>This movie reflects a more realistic scenario on things would ACTUALLY play out if we met a species that is so much more advanced than us, and so fundamentally different in every way. How would we communicate? How would communication work? Just look at how easily we misunderstand each other. How can we expect to make any sense of an alien race? <br/><br/>This movie is brilliantly thought out. You have to pay close attention at all times, as it gives you small clues that you'll need to put it all together towards the end.

"theocharous_an","8","1","7","10 February 2017"," An inspiring and thought-provoking sci-fi
","""If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?"". You may have come across this question before but never has it been so relevant as in Denis Villeneuve's latest sci-fi film, an exciting picture that explores a wide variety of topics including time-travel, extra-terrestrial life and linguistics. Arrival aims to inspire and challenge the audience and it does so very well.<br/><br/>Eric Heisserer had been trying for years to adapt the Nubella winner novella ""Story of your life"" by Ted Chiang. As of 2012, he had almost given up and the screenplay found its way in ""The Black List"", a collection of the best unproduced screenplays. Fortunately for all of us, Denis Villeneuve got an interest in it and the result was one of the best director/writer pairings of the year. The main character is Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguistics professor who is hired by the US military who are trying to translate the language of some unidentifiable beings that have apparently come from another place in the universe in twelve mysterious spacecrafts.Political tension grows all over the planet as the aliens' purpose is unknown and their only way of communicating is an incomprehensible writing. Teamed up with physics professor Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Louise must find a way to decipher the bewildering writing before the situation gets out of hand as nations all over the world start to face the spacecrafts with hostility.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve proves again that he is one of the most exciting directors working now in Hollywood. The directing is top-notch and combined with Bradford Young's cinematography and Jóhann Jóhannsson's score we have an excellently paced, visually stunning and deeply affecting feature. To top it all, Amy Adams gives an extraordinary performance. The absence of her name in the Best Leading actress Oscar nominations is probably the single most shocking snub of the year. She is absolutely stunning in this one. I could almost feel nausea myself when I first saw her in that suit. <br/><br/>The reason why Arrival works is that it tackles so many matters without offering a specific take on them. Everything is left to the audience. How should humanity tackle a possible alien approach? How important is language in our way of perceiving our nature? What would we change if we knew the future? I don't even dare to put myself in Louise's place. I can't tell if she made the right or wrong decision and the film won't tell you either. What else is remarkable about Arrival is how thoroughly it was researched scientifically. Several scientists, especially linguists, were approached to give their consult and this is what gives the film a realistic tone and solid background. If there is one thing that I didn't like was the confrontation with the ""Bootstrap Paradox"". This is when a future and a present action are both caused by one another without a logical explanation of how this cycle started. It's actually common among sci-fi films that deal with time travel, but it always feels irritating to me. Interstellar, Minority Report and Donnie Darko are just some of the titles. The paradox even has its own film titled Predestination. Fortunately, it's not so important in the plot of this film.<br/><br/>In summary, Arrival is an outstanding picture and I was delighted to know that it was nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cinematography. I repeat it's a shame Amy Adams was snubbed. It's good to know that films like these are produced in Hollywood and can't wait to see Villeneuve's next feature, the long-awaited Blade Runner sequel. He has showcased better than ever what he is capable of with Arrival and I really hope he continues to do what he knows best.<br/><br/>More reviews on https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com/"

"ianbuenav","7","1","7","8 February 2017"," The Arrival is an entertaining well made film, until you get to the ending.
","The First thing that i like in the movie is that i like the depiction of the aliens. How they tried to interact with them using a certain language. I was trying to imagine that perhaps if this scenario happens in real life we would be facing similar problems. I also like the mystery in trying to understand their language and i felt that part was executed well and the cast were outstanding.<br/><br/>What i don't like however is that on paper the story is very thin and it lacks substance. What i like most about the film about the aliens weren't as fleshed out as i would like to know more about them and their predicament after 3000 years as they said. Near the end, it feels like it was rushed and that the time-travelling part was quite out of place. It felt like it was a cheap way of using deus ex machina in order to put the protagonists role in the story..<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie for the most part. The problem is that i don't think this movie gives much depth or lesson to begin nor does the interesting portrayal of the aliens redeem the terrible excuse of the ending this movie has."

","This is a great film. The plot interweaves with the theme, the acting is really good. The pace of the film is very well done. If you are looking for a sci-fi film with high paced action and CGI to go with it, then this is not your film. However, this film uses special effects in a sparing and very effective way. If you want a thought provoking film, then this film is for you. It makes you think about how important communication is and when confronted with an unknown, is it the best policy to work with the unknown or against it."
"ivko","7","1","8","7 March 2017"," an interesting thought experiment
","I really liked this movie, but more as a thought experiment than as straight science fiction. If I had one criticism of the film it would be that it sort of changes tone in the last act from a ""hard"" sci-fi to more of a fantasy, leaving part of me wishing they had seen the original theme thru to the end.<br/><br/>Both themes are well done enough that I enjoyed the film despite any incongruities I perceived. I should mention that I turned the spoiler tag on just to be safe, but I'm going to try and be a little vague anyway because I don't want to spoil a few big reveals that come together at the end of the film.<br/><br/>The basic plot: the world is stunned when twelve alien craft suddenly descend to earth and throw open their doors. As society begins to buckle a bit under the strain of this historic event, a talented professor of linguistics who had previously worked with the government as a translator is selected to join the US team attempting to establish communication with the aliens.<br/><br/>This first act is probably my favorite part of the movie. The alien physiology and method of communicating is very well designed, which gives a definite ""this could really happen"" vibe that is very engaging.<br/><br/>Likewise, the challenges and methods used by the team to try and understand an alien species that shares very little in common with us was fascinating. In a lesser film it would be easy to have the protagonists ""realize"" that they needed some trivial concept to communicate while the rest of the cast looks on in awe (e.g. ""We just needed to realize that for the aliens, all of their conversation is done as stories!""). The reaction of the other characters is used to lead the audience to the idea that the protagonists are really smart, even if what they did isn't particularly brilliant. It's a common technique used by lazy writers to develop a sense of genius on screen when they don't really have any actual genius ideas to offer.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, a dangerous situation develops between the nations that has to do with each nations motivations and fears. And again it feels realistic and engaging as it unfolds, although here is where the fantasy ideas about to be revealed start to create some plot holes.<br/><br/>Without directly revealing any plot points, let me just make a couple of points about things that movies do that invariably create plot holes only solvable by ""magic"". The first is about anything having to do with traveling into the past or getting a book of horse race winners from the future or any other kind of ""information from the future"" scenario.<br/><br/>The basic problem here is that these situations always create paradoxes. If my crystal ball tells me that in five minutes some guy is going to punch me in the face I will invariably change my actions to avoid getting punched. But in doing so, I invalidate the ""future"" I saw. Information is, quite literally, energy, and by adding energy I am changing the conditions leading to the future and hence, the future. So knowing the future changes the past which changes the future which changes the past and so on. Movies that feature time travel have no choice but to gloss over this to keep the plot from becoming a confusing mess, and in so doing break with ""realistic"" story telling.<br/><br/>The second point I want to make is with what psychologists call magical thinking. This is where you make a mistaken connection between cause and affect, usually because you wish it were true. As in, ""if I go stand by the fridge my team always makes the field goal!"" Unless it's an X-men installment or whatever, movies don't usually have these plot elements in ""realistic"" movies because the writers know people will spot it and call them on it.<br/><br/>But there is an exception to this, which is when a writer takes a true piece of information and marries it to an unrelated but seemingly connected idea. Then the true fact becomes the justification for the made up thing. So for example, it's a proved fact that forcing yourself to smile even if you don't feel happy tricks the brain into actually feeling happier, something having to do with muscle memory or whatever. But if I tell you that and then tell you that learning to smile all the time can cure you of ever being depressed again, that is pure BS. The two ideas *seem* related, so knowing that the first one is true might let you believe the second one is too, but they're not and it isn't. The movie has a pretty big whopper in this category related to the true fact that immersing yourself in a foreign language actually changes the way you think.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" sticks to the idea of ""What would happen if aliens landed on earth tomorrow?"" pretty well, and makes a stab at showing how people might react. In the last act it uses some of the issues I mentioned above to veer away from this into ""What if space wizards gave us magic?"" territory, but really only so that they could wrap up the plot and ask some interesting philosophical questions on their way out. Bottom line, I really enjoyed the film. I just think I might have enjoyed it a little more as a straight sci-fi flick than as a fantasy piece."

Linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Theoretical Physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are brought in to communicate with the aliens to find out if they are friendly and why they are here and what do they want?<br/><br/>We can be somewhat thankful that the US Army doesn't bring all their tanks and fighter jets to confront the Alien ships as we have seen in many Sci-Fi stories of the past. No, we see a more civilized approach, but Louise and Ian are as confused as we are. <br/><br/>This is slow-going, and we keep waiting for something to happen that will benefit mankind. Isn't that why movies are made? Ooops, my mistake. <br/><br/>Okay, long story short the Aliens are here to give mankind a gift now because in the future - in 3000 years - they will need our help in return. When you find out what that gift, is email me so I will know. One could say the gift is for the nations of the world to find a way to work together to avoid destroying themselves. You buy that? Louise does ask them how do they know the future? How indeed?<br/><br/>We see Louise struggle with trying to communicate with aliens who look like giant squids and we see-flashbacks with her daughter Hannah leaning about language and emotions.

Hard to tell. <br/><br/>You see I don't buy any of this. Why? Because aliens who are much more advanced than we are would surely know how to communicate with us ""in our language.""

","I'm truly surprised by the number of negative reviews. I felt compelled to create an IMDb account and add my 2 cents to counter the apparent fecal storm in the reviews section.<br/><br/>The average moviegoer has been conditioned to expect a certain type of content (look up ""Pavlov's Dogs""). When they don't get it, they are confused. They feel cheated and stupid.<br/><br/>Arrival is a movie that indeed delivers on so many different levels. It deals with the practical aspects of extraterrestrial contact. How would one approach an alien and how would one engage in a dialogue with them? Through the protagonist's eyes we can learn about the beauty of the ""human experience."" The audience gets to analyze the situation at hand as the movie progresses. <br/><br/>But if you are one of those people that always expects aliens to land on the White House lawn (where such things usually land) and if you expect an instant violent encounter with numerous lasers and explosions, you're out of luck. Please stop expecting this type of content. Arrival is not categorized as an action movie!<br/><br/>Why not learn about the Fermi Paradox or the Arecibo message? The movie is so much more than ""some chick translating stuff for two hours."" If you want action and guns, go see something else. If you're looking for intellectual stimulation and if you enjoy a good balance between character development and an eloquently designed story-line, this movie might just be for you.<br/><br/>TL;DR: This movie is for smart hombres.

At no point does she appear a superhuman hero destined to save the world (although she quite definitely is).

A different kind of 'Extra-terrestrial' film in my eyes but I may have been blinded by a feeling this would end up like some sort of poor mans Independence Day. Not a huge amount of what I'd call 'guns and glory' action but it still felt really exciting. This was tempered excellently with the slower moving, subdued and sad scenes. The storyline was well crafted, kept me really engaged throughout and the crescendo was really clever and thought provoking. Rightly so Amy Adams has had some plaudits as she was excellent throughout but I loved Jeremy Renners contribution and thought it played a huge part in making Adams character.

"dsalouk","9","1","8","6 February 2017"," Delightfully deep and powerful
","Arrival is another great film by Villeneuve, who seems unable to put a foot wrong so far. It has a suspenseful score akin to Sicario that creates a tense and highly strung tone. Amy Adams showcases some incredible acting that helps bring to light its interesting and questioning time-line. Playing with concepts of the effect of language on the mind, this film is emotionally charged, as well as influential on its take on language, time, and the inevitability of ones actions. Arrival is a fantastic film, enabling a shroud of intrigue and excitement with the perfect close. It is disappointing to see such a talented actress as Adams still not rewarded for her performances, that are unquestionably getting better as the years progress."
"jssrfx","10","1","8","5 February 2017"," An inspired, visionary, and emotional appeal to knowledge and humanity
","This movie has done something that rarely happens to me. It has left me emotional on many levels, it has inspired vision, and is very thought provoking. As someone who speaks more than one language fluently, I do understand the difficulty, both, in mastering different meanings, and how one misspoken word can potentially cause conflict.<br/><br/>I've always had a love for science-fiction, especially Star Trek, so the entire concept of mutual understanding, working together, and even the concept that time is not linear, was nothing new to me. In a time and age where it seems that 'racism' is common place again, and in a time, that seems to seed diversity more than unity, this movie touches on something that is very, very true. The fact that only if we all realize that there is only ONE RACE on this world, when we start working together, only then will we truly start making progress. That is where this movie conveys its powerful message.<br/><br/>Whether the alien species shown in this movie recognizes our potential, our creativity, and above all else the one trait that all of us have in common, curiosity, or whether they just found the one other planet close by that has intelligent life, is kept in the dark. It is not important. What we have here is a linguist and a scientist who both try to establish a dialogue, constantly fighting the fear and instinct to lash out by their own, and other country's governments and military. We understand the importance to not surrender to fear, distrust, and paranoia, which is something that plays an all too real role in our time and age.<br/><br/>The conclusion that a single gesture to reach out can change the course of history, and that even cultures that are diverse to the superficial view, have a common ground; basic interaction, personal needs, wishes, and desires, and that those are far more important than any political agenda. The moment we realize that talking to one another, and more importantly listening, is the solution to conflict, a global peace will be possible.<br/><br/>This is a movie about science, knowledge, and understanding. If you don't find that appealing, the entire message may be lost on you anyway, but you would also miss one of the greatest science-fiction movies of all time."
"hennyxu","9","1","8","1 February 2017"," must see
","Henny's Movie Review: Arrival (NO SPOILERS)<br/><br/>In two words: MUST SEE.<br/><br/>Arrival was truly a welcome change in a time where mindless action movies reigned supreme. It is a good drama/scifi/mystery movie that will keep your attention from beginning to end (something most movies these days are struggling with). So why are you even reading this review? Really, go and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed, especially since ""they have arrived"".<br/><br/>The following will dissect the movie: Arrival, discuss the current movie industry and the art of film making. Don't worry I'll keep it all as concise as possible, however I do need to discuss all of the aforementioned topics since it is all related to the movie. The review will be divided into the following point:<br/><br/><ul><li>First I'll give my opinion/dissatisfaction of the movie industry (i.e., Hollywood). - Second, I'll talk about movie as a visual medium - And third I'll review the movie (certain parts of the review are intertwined with the first and second points) this time I'll keep it a bit superficial to prevent spoilers.</li></ul><br/><br/>Movies these days are often catered to the common denominator with studio executives, more often than not, deciding which path to take. This is understandable since it will most likely lead to more profit. However, depending on the choices made, these decisions can also ruin a movie. Furthermore, it is restricting the director and the rest of the cast and crew creatively. This is something that is happening too often in Hollywood (e.g., suicide squad, fan4stic), resulting in mindless action movies or movies that are afraid to take the extra step. Movies have become safe and this can be traced back to how they treat the intelligence of the audience. I often say that it is important to treat your audience as smart people whom understand more than less. This will lead to better stories and positively affect the progression of a movie (e.g., less explaining). With all that said Arrival doesn't suffer from studio interferences and most importantly treats the audience as intelligent people (more on this later in the review). I do have to admit though that I do like simple movies, they are harmless fun. <br/><br/>Movies are a visual medium that uses images to convey a story. Even though, this is basic knowledge we still have many movies that spend hours and hours on explaining things. This shouldn't be necessary if the movie uses the visual medium properly. I'm not saying that we can cut all the dialogues out of a movie; however I'm saying that if you treat your audience as intelligent people you won't need certain dialogues. Sometimes a simple, better yet, a good impactful image can say more than a thousand words. This is something that immediately jumps to my mind when I was watching Arrival. The dialogues are short and most of the events are conveyed through visuals (e.g., facial expressions, surroundings) and atmosphere. It is one thing to tell a story but when we watch a movie we want to see it.<br/><br/>Thank you for listening to the ramblings of an old man. Without further ado let's talk about Arrival.<br/><br/>Arrival is a movie directed by Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners) starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. It is a well put together circa 2 hour movie that effectively uses imagery and atmosphere to convey the story and keep you intrigued.<br/><br/>The story (no spoilers): Arrival tells a story about a linguistics professor Louise Banks, played by Amy Adams, whom is tasked to interpret an alien language when twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world. The story has a very good progression, there are no moments within the movie that dragged and throughout the narrative the movie knows where to put the focus. The atmosphere is very good and more importantly constant. It doesn't jump all over the place.<br/><br/>Characters: The movie has two main characters namely Professor Louise Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly (played by Jeremy Renner). Louise is the main protagonist/lead character and we discover everything together with her. Her development throughout this movie is interestingly confusing. Ian is there to support Louise with scientific questions and discoveries. His role is quite minor but important to an extent. I know this is all quite vague but the reason for this is to prevent spoilers.<br/><br/>Cinematography: The cinematography of Arrival isn't that spectacular. It has a grey/greenish color with a serious vibe throughout the movie. The alien spacecraft is interesting, but most of the time the movie takes place in an army base.<br/><br/>Three-Act-Structure: - Beginning, Strong with a good setup for things to come. - Middle, Good continuation of what was setup with a short moment for everything to sink in. - End, Strong ending.<br/><br/>Music: It did a good job to set to mood but other than that it isn't really noteworthy (shame).<br/><br/>Summary/conclusion: As you can tell I really liked this movie. It was something I really needed especially since I've seen many B quality movies lately (also talking about you INFERNO). Arrival doesn't hold your hand throughout the movie and it assumes you have a basic understanding of science. I liked this because other movies would've used a part of the movie to explain every scientific theory. I would love to go into more detail about this movie especially the pros and cons, but that would spoil the movie. So I apologies for this superficial review and I promise I'll do better next time. The movie is called Arrival and it truly has. Finally a must watch movie has arrived.<br/><br/>I give this movie a: 8.5"

","We write and speak in sentences, which usually from left to right, is in a literal line. What if languages is non-linear? Languages involve time dimension, in which implies there is space limit when writing. From Arrival's depictions on how aliens, the Heptapods communicate have put the movie far more than just Hollywood aliens-category. It tries to emphasizes from languages, conversations and communications, to a much deeper dimension on non-linear time. Humans and Heptapods experience time differently. Human view time linearly, with past, present and future, while Heptapods view it non-linearly. When the Russians were confused by their Heptapods who send message, 'There is no time.' It literally refers their languages is unbounded by time dimension. <br/><br/>The Heptapods rely on semiotic communication that could draw the whole picture quickly and effectively. Their languages are depicted as in inky circulars, representing that there is no beginning or end. It could further put forward that their dimension does not involve end or beginning, which is non-linear. They experience past and future all at once. <br/><br/>'What do they want? Where are they from?' are the questions that the 12 countries trying to unravel, so as Lousie and Ian. Throughout the process of teaching the Heptapods, Abbott and Costello, human languages, Louise has eventually delve herself into the inky circular languages, which she even dream in heptapods' way. In a scene when Louise and Ian went back to the dome, to make clear what does the Heptapods wrote 'Offer weapons.' literally mean, as Louise stressed on the difference between weapons and tools. One of the Heptapod offers inky fog to Louise, however, she first expressed she couldn't handle with only two hands as the ink circulars system is far more complicated from that she used. But then, she closed her eyes, conveying her thoughts to the inky fog, meaningful inky circular formed. <br/><br/>'If you could see your whole life laid out in front of you, would you change things?' Louise asked Ian. Through changing the narrow perception towards time, Louise could see the world as the Heptapods do, in non-linear time dimension, without past, present and future. At the beginning of the movie Louise's daughter Hannah infected with life-threatening disease. At first, it seems to be Louise's flashback. But then, it turns out to be neither flashback or flash-forward. Near the ending, when Louise tells her daughter, Hannah, that her name is palindrome, she is explaining to the audience: these just simply exist free from time dimension. 'I used to think this was the beginning of your story' as Louise narrated near the ending. There is no beginning or ending. Live in the moment, unbound from time, past or future and make choices."
"Oberrated","9","1","8","29 January 2017"," Let curiosity take control and enjoy this sci-fi masterpiece
","'Arrival' was truly a wild ride. Honestly, I feel this will be a film to be remembered within the genre for years to come. While some fans of the genre may feel that Sci-Fi films should be filled with alien blasting action or deep adventure, 'Arrival' thrives off of the desire to understand and an all-around curiosity for not only what an alien species could do if they were to interact with human civilization but what human nature could do given if this situation were to happen. As an audience member, I found myself curious as to what was going to happen next within the story from start to finish. Although moving at what could be seen as a slow pace, it had this creative ""edge-of-your-seat"" feel to it as I anticipated anything to happen at any moment. If you are to view this film, I will warn you, curiosity and confusion can/will occur, but it only compliments the creativity within this film... Production wise, director Denis Villeneuve executes with suave perfection. With every passing moment, you can feel his influence in what he wanted each actor and actress to express with every movement and reaction. From as little as a simple gesture to the biggest line execution. A special nod goes to Bradford Young for the cinematography within this piece. There were scenes and moments within this films that looked utterly beautiful that blended so well with the vibe of the film. Leaving myself, personally, with stills and movie moments I will never forget as they were so interesting and creative to watch unfold.<br/><br/>With the Sci-Fi Drama 'Arrival', expect curiosity to take over. It is a story to remember and debate/discuss with your friends for hours on end. A strong recommendation here from Oberrated and yet another worthy Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>-- Oberrated.com --"

","This was a good movie. I was reading the reviews to see if whether or not I actually wanted to go watch it. There were no ""okay movie"" reviews; it was either flat out bad or flat out good to people who had already watched it. This made me very skeptical about watching it.<br/><br/>Boy oh boy was I glad that I watched the movie. I kept in mind the negative reviews while watching the movie to see if people weren't really just nitpicking too much.....people were just really nitpicking too much. When you nitpick too much about a movie, of course you're not going to like it because you're hung up on the stuff that you nitpicked at.<br/><br/>If you allowed yourself to be immersed in the movie, you'll love it. The first 30-45 minutes or so was SUPER slowwwww, BUT, I understand why. The director was really just trying to immerse the viewers into the movie with different AND beautiful shots. The cinematography of this movie is outstanding; even the people who hated the movie have to respect that part of the movie.<br/><br/>Watch it if you haven't. Let the mood of the movie set in, and just watch. Don't nitpick because things do get explained in this movie; some, you just have to connect yourself through previous dialogue."

","It is a good movie, at least before the conclusion of the first half or so. Good enough to pay movie to watch? Not really. Also, the film cr@ps out at the end thanks to blatant pandering to Chinese audiences. In other recent big budget films over the years, you would just see some random Chinese actors doing pointless sh!t in the background for some idiotic subplot. But this film takes the pandering to catastrophically moronic levels. Frankly, it cheapens the movie up until the end, where it just kills the movie. The ending reminds me of a Batman V Superman ""Martha"" moment. What seems like an interesting film turns into a convoluted eye-roll of a hipster's parable."

"tymbus","4","1","8","16 November 2016"," Enough of the suffering, more of the suffrage!""
","Arrival is science fiction cinema for women. <br/><br/>The film shifts science fiction cinema's preoccupation with re- enacting colonial conflict and discovery as ""a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores"" (Malcolm, Jurassic Park) to a relationship drama played out between linguistics expert Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner).<br/><br/>'Arrival' refers to the appearance of twelve enigmatic alien spaceships on Earth and to the yet to be born the birth of Banks's and Donnelly's baby girl , who we see as an infant and as a young adult in the film's opening moments. As memories of a life that has not yet occurred unfold for Banks, so does her ability to understand the Aliens' purpose in visiting the earth.<br/><br/>So 'Independence Day' this isn't, thank goodness. Arrival is, instead, a wistful, dreamlike exploration of the meaning of human suffering. At the same time, it explores the way reality is gendered by culture and the categories by which we perceive reality. Differences between masculinity and femininity are sometimes expressed in the opposition between 'hard' and 'soft'. On the science fiction literary scene 'hard' or even 'radically hard' SF is characterized by its focus on engineering, the physical sciences and humanity as little more than meat. <br/><br/>In contrast, Arrival knowingly foregrounds the soft (humanistic) science of linguistics, communication and emotion. The hard sciences are represented by Donnelly (a physicist. But SF cinema's masculine focus on war, conflict, and destruction is relegated to a threatening backdrop against which Bank's and Donnelly's relationship and Bank's attempts to communicate with aliens are played out.<br/><br/>In place of quantum physics the film explicitly references socio- linguistics and, in particular, the 'Sapir-Whorf hypothesis', that language shapes or even determines our perception of reality. As an aside, it was Sapir's student Benjamin Lee Whorf who was responsible, in an article 'Science and Linguistics', for spreading the academic urban legend that Eskimos have anything from four to a thousand (!) words for snow. Whorf's main legacy is a linguistic relativism that posits language determines perceptions whether that be perceptions of the alien (here, the film utilizes the time honored convention of representing the alien 'other' as a kind of squid) or of men and women. In a culture where gender difference is a fundamental way of categorizing the world, time itself can be gendered.<br/><br/>Masculine time is characteristically linear, goal directed and enacted in the public sphere, feminine time is cyclical, marked by repetition and enacted in the domestic sphere. Fundamentally, feminine time is organized around child birth and child care. While this will strike some ears as over generalized and prejudicial, what way time should be spent forms part of the core of sexism (and racism) in, for example, women's experience of employment. Whorf himself used a study of the Hopi to exemplify the way conceptions of time can be culturally relativistic. He, contentiously, argued that the Hopi have no concept of time and that the Western concept of time as flowing smoothly from the past to the present is culturally specific. In Arrival, the Aliens work with a cyclical (feminine) conception of time.<br/><br/>The cyclical way the Aliens live in time is represent by the aliens' language – which consists of circles of ink and by the name Bank's gives her child – 'Hannah', a palindrome that can be read forwards and backwards. The Aliens' purpose on Earth is reciprocal – they are here to help us so that in three thousand years we can help them. Or should that be we have helped them so they would help us? As Bank's learn the Aliens' language so her experience of time changes and past and present become one. Here family memories turn out to be memories of the future – if we cling to the model of linear time.<br/><br/>While Arrival seems to challenge confining stereotypes of cinema science fiction, appearances can be deceiving. My first disappointment was that the film argues that only by working together can humanity secure a better future. But, despite the appeal to the Chinese mark place, the script balks at collectivism and returns to an all too familiar appeal to one man making a difference or, in this case, one woman with the help and protection of a couple of men.<br/><br/>But more troubling there seemed something insidious about the film's world view. It does address an audience of women and it does place as center stage much of what the Sci-Fi genre leaves behind. And cultural feminists have argued that what liberal feminists see as discriminatory stereotypes are actually real lived differences between men and women that are to be honored and valued. <br/><br/>By advocating acceptance of the inevitability of life and death, the absolute already determined past and present the film also feels like it is advocating acceptance of the way things are, including gender difference. No room for protesting here, or for radical rethinking the nature of gender. What will be, will be. What is, is. The birth and death are for women to celebrate and mournfully embrace. <br/><br/>Arrival, and the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis around which it is built, encourage predetermination. The result, replicated in this review, is a conflation of linguistic categories with lived experience. Whether positively or negatively valued, those categories of masculinity and femininity are constraining. <br/><br/>There's no place in Arrival's world of the inevitable for the collective action of women now demonstrating on America's streets against male determination of their bodies and their future. What is needed at times of change is another, more open construction of time in which time's arrow and cyclical time are both replaced and remade as something new. Now is again the time for less acceptance of suffering and more embracing of suffrage."
"kgprophet","6","1","8","13 November 2016"," Part ""Contact"" Part ""Interstellar""
","It is very hard to find some new angle when it comes to Aliens. You leave it a director with a vision, top notch actors, and a decent budget. But it still depends on story, again what's the new angle? You may remember that ""Contact"" and ""Interstellar"" had a daughter who gets messages from outside our world. Both movies intertwine the daughters life experiences with the plot line. Now comes our protagonist's daughter, Hannah, who lives in the memories of Amy Adams, the mother. I instantly knew the flashbacks that show the daughter alive before her fatal disease at the beginning of this movie would be relevant later in the film. The main complaint is not the story so much as not enough layers that one would hope an intelligent looking film like this could portray. More layers, but not TOO many layers, like Interstellar was guilty of. It just felt like the second act, a threat of force against our visitors, was kept at a slow cook. Same with the slow revelations as communication with the aliens is developed.<br/><br/>Here is the good news. I complained a few years ago that in recent Hollywood movies aliens is aliens is aliens. In other words, there was nothing mystical (or scary) about the aliens after being depicted multiple times in multiple movies over time. Does anyone remember ""The Arrival"" with Charlie Sheen? That was 1996, the CGI aliens looked fake, and were nothing close to being scary. So credit Denis Villeneuve for taking care in making these aliens frightening. A suggestion I made in my review of ""Cowboys and Aliens"" is that they should make the aliens have some kind of supernatural influence on people, Twilight Zone freaky. The remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" gave the alien some control of a guy's brain waves. That was cool. Here the slow discovery of the alien's language has a nice twist to it, but the story has little else at that point.<br/><br/>I felt like saying to the filmmakers at that point in the second act, ""Okay, something exciting better happen now"". The threat of using force by a couple other countries gives some urgency in getting Amy Adams to find out the purpose of the aliens visit to Earth, which has been benevolent so far. Ominous music, and other hints seem to warn the audience that these aliens can overpower us puny humans. The supporting characters should be more substantial to help create some depth. Jeremy Renner for instance doesn't seem to have a lot to say, even though he supposedly is one the country's most brilliant scientists. Otherwise Amy Adams has no friends and has little to hang her emotions on.<br/><br/>So finally the third act tries to put it all together, slowly. I mention ""Interstellar"" because in that movie the daughter became the connection to the 'answer' in that movie. Without getting into spoilers, you may find the big resolution not very spectacular. I really enjoyed the idea that consciousness could evolve and advance our world after contact with aliens. It just doesn't resonate as much with such a simple and personal answer. I also mention ""Contact"", because the female protagonist develops her own special connection in deciphering the alien's language.<br/><br/>I have really been enjoying the smart and intelligent ""Black Mirror"" series of films. They are like an extended TV episode, where there is only room for a simple story, and can be explored fully in the shorter amount of time. Arrival probably would have been better as a ""Black Mirror"" episode, and the slower second half of the film tightened up as a result. I would ultimately recommend this film, with a warning this is not a special effects spectacular, but a more of a suspense film. The filmmakers successfully make these aliens feel dangerous that we don't really know the outcome."

","I really loved this film for the most part.... was a bit slow but it did keep my interest for most of it and no one did or said anything stupid so that's always a positive. However, it was a film that didn't know how to end itself so it came up with the biggest cop out ending. It was just another interstellar. Or should I say bill and ted... how do we get out of the cell... I know, when we get out we will leave the keys under the bed and then we can ourselves out. I know it's a science fiction theory but I really hate it in a film and for 2 years running we have films that events in the future effect the past. None of the film made sense with that ending. To be honest, I doubt that the aliens even exist... I think that they are a human projection as no one actually touched them, the 'spaceship' didn't exist as no one tested the materials and maybe inter stellar travel doesn't work and the future humans created this event to get the people in the past to work together. There was no communication between the ships as they already know what would happen as it has already happened so there was no need to communicate. I just hated the ending and it's a film that I wouldn't watch again as there just isn't enough in the film for me to go back to... no hidden depth at all."
"smhgkbyrk","10","1","9","5 February 2017"," Best of 2017
","Firstly, to put your mind at ease, I won't be analyzing the plot, thus avoiding the use of spoilers. This decade, Villeneuve has crafted some fantastic works of art in the form of 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and now this science fiction gem, and here's hoping his career further develops with more movie masterpieces coming our way. In a world where mysteries remain and the possibility of extraterrestrial life still stands unanswered, 'Arrival' approaches this with it's cliché-free take on the genre.<br/><br/>One scene in particular features a cloud that took my breath away. Sure, the extraterrestrial vehicle was amazing, but that cloud... As a photojournalist of nearly fifty years, I was stunned at the lifelike character of the cloud and suspected it was real, though I knew that was impossible; you can't cue Mother Nature when it's time to roll. I wanted to praise the CGI team for the effect, but Shawn Levy confirmed it was natural. They had set up to shoot this wide shot, worried about impending rain, or too much wind, or the lighting being too dark for the right effect, but the cloud wanted to become a star that day, and it rolled into frame with absolute perfection. This scene alone is worth a nod to Bradford Young for best cinematography."

","You will be disappointed if you think its just another alien movie. If you need an action alien film, watch ""Independence Day"".<br/><br/>The movie starts with a mother, Louise, and her loss of losing a young daughter. It was sad. Then it jumps to the arrival of stone like structures appearing around the globe, hovering 20 feet above the ground. Louise is a doctor in linguistics and is called to serve her country by communicating and understanding aliens. Louise is teamed up with Ian the scientist to explore the reasons for the arrival of alien ships.<br/><br/>The movie goes on with the world threatened by aliens and different nation's different approach to the threat handling. During all the chaos, word spreads that the aliens are here to deliver / sell a weapon, which spikes greed in all the countries for it and creates more instability.<br/><br/>Louise however, studies the language and comes to the conclusion that the aliens are here to give them a gift. The gift of their language which will help them foresee the future as they advance. Louise's understanding of language opens the future to her. She sees, how she could prevent the war on aliens and help mankind. And she handles it well.<br/><br/>Now comes the twist. Remember when I wrote that the movie starts with Louise and her loss of daughter, well that part was actually future. Louise never had a daughter before arrival of the aliens. But learning their language cleared the future and she knew what would happen and how her daughter will get sick of an incurable disease in the future.<br/><br/>The interesting part is that she still chooses to marry Ian and have a daughter because she loved her so much in her visions.<br/><br/>The aliens left earth by disappearing after the gift. The question is, why were they here to give us the gift of future vision? Maybe because they had already seen the destruction of earth because of all the war and hate. And now they wanted us to see it and stop it from happening.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the movie was good but it could be complicated for some people. But do watch it and comment."

","The idea is great and the acting was really good, but there are many errors, in my opinion, in the early parts of the film.I mean,you can't really believe that the only people thinking rationally will be the two main characters,and the constant need to explain everything that comes to mind is really dull.Every military person is in constant need of blowing something up, doesn't respond to common decency and is being really conservative about any of the ideas that are peaceful and not war-related. Than there's the problem of communication with the rest of the world,but that might not be too far from reality (its a dumb world we live in).It's kinda childish in my opinion.The ending is something special.On one hand,it's really powerful and interesting (it gave me the chills), but on the other,it's too unrealistic and that magical moment where Louise gets the knowledge from the alien really doesn't cut it for me,since it's a plausible situation in the future (until that moment) and a big problem if it does actually happen. Overall,even with some errors and a bunch of clichés, Arrival really got my attention and the acting of Amy Adams(at least should have got a nomination),as well as the plot,is really something special."

Arrival explores the sciences of language and communication and sheds light on a subject that is often remiss, and yet, is essential to humanity. <br/><br/>And finally, the concept of time and how it is portrayed in the film. The film's unclear time line (that becomes perfectly clear by the end) beautifully demonstrates the complexity of time and questions our perceived conceived ideas of its functions."
"KineticSeoul","8","1","9","21 January 2017"," Existential sci-fi film about humanity and time
","This is one of those films that I have a lot of appreciation for but probably wouldn't watch again. It's a artistic, existential and symbolic film that doesn't try to go in a pretentious direction. Instead most of the cryptic messages and symbols can be understood after some deep thinking. This isn't a sci-fi action movie or a sci-fi film with a lot of tension and thrills. Instead it's a very quite and slow paced sci-fi film that focuses in on humanity, universal language and the concept of time. So yeah I have respect for the director Denis Villeneuve to make a symbolic and artistic film that doesn't get pretentious or overly ambiguous. Overall, this is a impactful film that will keep the audiences thinking about existence, time and the importance of love and relationships because it's fleeting.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Beautiful movie that stays with you for a while, making you think it through and leaving a mark. This is not just another ""first encounter"" alien sci-fi flick. The story is beautifully layered and works with making the viewer feel rather than flat out throw something in your face to make a point. Do not expect and just take it at face value. I absolutely loved it and would watch it again. People who dislike it probably wanted more action, but I think it is so refreshing for such a ""big"" subject to be delivered so gently. In truth nobody knows how an alien introduction would go because we humans live in our own world with our own logic and this movie makes that point perfectly. So the critical remarks on how believable the plot is really make no sense to me. I'd say this was pure perfection 10/10."
"rannynm","10","1","9","12 November 2016"," Extremely High Wow Factor - A Must Go for any Sci-Fi Fan
","This movie can only be described as something that starts out with a very simple idea and ends up turning into a complex and exciting story. Arrival is a truly sci-fi movie that you watch with your mouth open in amazement that gets better by the minute with an unforgettable and unpredictable ending. <br/><br/>Arrival begins when 12 UFOs touch down in random places on Earth. The whole world is panicking and the United States looks to a talented linguist named Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and a gifted Theoretical Physicist named Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to help translate what the aliens really want from us and what their purpose on Earth is. Once the new team starts uncovering the information about the mysterious species, they find very surprising things that go against everything we once knew. <br/><br/>The movie is great overall but the ending is what really makes Arrival so legendary. The special effects are spectacular and the acting is extraordinary. Amy Adams excels in her role of Dr. Banks. What I most liked about the movie is how it all comes together. Without spoiling anything, I will say that the ending is mysterious and can be interpreted in hundreds of different ways depending on what angle you look at it from. The only other movies that have such perfect endings and make you actually think deeply about what exactly is happening are Interstellar and Inception. Another thing about this film that blew me away is the cinematography. From giant aerial shots of 1500 foot UFOs to a fleet of battleships about to start an attack, the cinematography truly adds to the intensity and amazement of the film. My one small criticism has to do with the last few minutes. The creators stretch it out about five minutes too long in their attempt to show in very deep detail what exactly happens at the end. I feel like they could have shortened it and explained the ending instead of stretching it out, but that only lasts a couple of minutes and is hardly noticeable. Another huge perk is the sound editing and the soundtrack. The sounds of the UFOs and the aliens are intense and the music perfectly suits the story. This combination makes your heart thump and works wonders with surround sound. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is when the aliens first start writing in their language. They write using something that resembles ink that stays in the air. It is truly beautiful and unique. It is unlike anything else I've ever seen before in a sci-fi movie with aliens. I also like this scene because it is when they start talking about their language and how they talk backward and forward at the same time. If they think like this, they can write and create a complex sentence in a split of a second, which amazed me. I also admired how the story treats their language almost like an art form and not just a way of communication.<br/><br/>There is a presence of some mature language in a few scenes as well as very intense and dramatic moments, so I recommend it for ages 13 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars despite one small hiccup because of just how it makes you think about life and the future and gets your adrenaline pumping.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

","I've watched Amy Adams since 'Junebug' and once again, she gives a great performance.<br/><br/>Its a quiet sc-fi and I didn't know the story before hand, beyond the very basics. If we needed further proof that a good script makes spending on CGI unnecessary - this is it. <br/><br/>For some strange reason Amy Adams didn't get top billing, with her supporting cast listed further down or in smaller font. What does a woman have to do to get top billing? Be the only face on screen for the duration of the film??<br/><br/>Sure there are twists in the story, but they happen quietly, without Dolby Surround Sound or 3D glasses.<br/><br/>It was 2 hours well spent and no doubt I'll catch it again.<br/><br/>I can't recommend it highly enough - although I have no respect for the movie or advertising executives (presumably men) who think that a woman doesn't deserve top billing. <br/><br/>I don't pay to see films where men hog the script / budget dollars. If women are 51% of the planet - we deserve to be 51% of actors with 51% of the lines and 51% of the budget.<br/><br/>If movie executives want my money - they'll have to learn to respect women."

"estreet-eva","8","1","10","6 March 2017"," Best hard scifi since ""Moon""
","PwC's Abbott and Costello routine with the Academy Award Best Picture envelopes should have been used as an opportunity to have a rethink. ""La La Land"" despite it's 6 (or was it 7?) wins was certainly not as good either this film or ""Hidden Figures"". ""Arrival"" is more the narrative sister of ""Hidden Figures"" than it is ""Contact"" to which it has been extensively compared. First, it does not share the disastrous Deux Ex Machina second act of the Jodie Foster vehicle, instead of using a ""Pulp Fiction""-esque nonlinear structure to present a tight narrative from start to finish. Second, the science shares co-pilot duties with philosophy throughout ""Arrival"" while ""Contact"" eventually devolves into an ""I am your father"" search for identity and failure of the movie to dance with the rationality that brought it. The invited cast to this dance acquits themselves well throughout the proceedings although theoretic physicists don't generally look like Jemery Renner. Amy Adams' doughty-named Louise is reflected in her own look somewhat past the spring of her days in knockoff Rom Coms such as the formulaic ""Leap Day"". The story very much is not a knockoff reflecting vital current issues in scientific thinking including the limits language imposes on thinking and implied limits on the human mind. Having said that the original 1998 publication date means we don't see the application of artificial intelligence that would certainly have been brought to bear should the alien visits have occurred in 2017. The story also gifts college film studies' professors with fertile discussion questions for their classes. It also reinforces the principle that all great movies have a great question at their core. The visuals, while very serviceable, are not quite at the same level of greatness as the questions raised in the script. The heptapoid aliens Abbott and Costello look more like forearms and hands thrust down from the top of the screen into a fish tank in need a cleaning. The alien ships they inhabit look more like one of those brown nuts you need a metallic nutcracker to open and our limited view within the ship is a square hallway which more like an especially deep storage unit than anything else. One wonders expects the giant hand creatures reach down and wipe it with a Clorox clean-up wipe after the humans leave for the day. In short, while not visually arresting, ""Arrival"" is a smart, taught story which asks much of its audience and potentially was the best film of 2016."

"brynjolfson","9","1","10","30 January 2017"," Best part is... it makes you want to read the book
","Every field of study needs its limelight in Hollywood, and this time it's linguistics. This film, directed by a French-Canadian, composed by an Icelander, and based on a Hugo award winning novella by Ted Chiang (a Chinese-American) depicts the complicated and geopolitically unstable circumstances that would arise if extra-terrestrial lifeforms suddenly appeared on our planet. At least, that's what it seems like on the surface. Underneath the typical Hollywood plot is a story with gripping philosophical and linguistic inquiries into the nature of reality. We find ourselves fascinated with each new discovery uncovered by the protagonist, an inquisitive linguist played by Amy Adams, as she begins to grasp the new Alien language. Included in her realizations are an unearthly way of perceiving time and a paradoxical new perspective on the issue of determinism vs. free will. <br/><br/>Amazingly, the film never goes into annoying explication, despite the highly technical nature of the setting and the complexity of the plot line. The film always gives a strong taste without revealing too much. To some this might be annoying and confusing, to others (like myself) it might spur a relentless curiosity. After the film had ended I found an online copy of the book from which it's based. I would highly recommend others do the same. Though the visuals, effects, and cinematography of the film are enchanting, and overall it is masterfully made, the philosophical themes are far more engrossing in the novella. Ted Chiang has an incredible aptitude for conveying mind- blowing scientific, linguistic, and philosophical wonders in a few short sentences. Not to mention, the story of Louise's relation to her daughter is far more personalized as we get to see things from her mind's eye. <br/><br/>The difference between the book and the film is seen most clearly in the titles. In ""The Story of your Life,"" the alien encounter is only a back drop to the story of Louise's daughter. Whereas, in ""Arrival,"" global turmoil and creepy alien encounters play front-and-center."

However, while the US military is patient with the ship in its territory, China and Russia are in very close positions to attack the ships that are in their countries, at the risk of a possible counteroffensive by the aliens to with the planet.<br/><br/>With this movie, Villeneuve takes his first contact with science fiction before the great challenge that is in filming: the sequel to Blade Runner. In the first half of the film, we can say that he has done it sublime, photography and sound effects during the first incursion to the alien ship, the Canadian director takes us to a stage of tension and intrigue. A disturbing staging with Kubrick echoes that becomes risky due to its temporal phenomena reminiscent of the end of Interstellar, which may cause many viewers not to find a logical solution at the end of the film.

","""Now that's a proper introduction."" Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) <br/><br/>Alien visitation can be pretty much as you envision it because no one has a clue what aliens would look like or how they would communicate. The latter is the special focus of Arrival, a very modern mash up of Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Contact, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and countless other sci-fi's that attempt to show the biggest challenge to be understanding the visitors before the military makes a mess.<br/><br/>Louise is a linguist engaged by the US to translate the whale-like sounds of heptapods, who have seven elephant trunk-like legs and squirt ink in Rorschach circles that form the language she must translate before the military gets trigger happy. Beside the emphasis on good communication skills, Arrival effectively touches on the need for cooperation to face a potential threat from outer space.<br/><br/>It becomes clear that before we deal with other worlds, we need to understand each other in this one. Starting with oneself as Louise must do, and her physicist partner in the project, Ian (Jeremy Renner), understanding the foreign language becomes more an art and less a science.<br/><br/>Director Dennis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer expertly guide us through the competing forces during the uncertainty of the invasion without the usual screaming and yelling of mass hysteria or many other tropes of the sci-fi genre. The 12 space ships around the world are more like the apostles on an almost inscrutable mission, carried by ships that look like contact lenses, all the better for us to see ourselves, I suppose.<br/><br/>To say much more would be to reveal plot, not a good thing in a film that luxuriates in ambiguity. Sufficient to say that Arrival is an entertaining and intelligent voyage into our minds as it provokes us to consider the power of memory shaping how we deal with reality now and the power of communication to bridge the gap of misunderstanding . Some day world peace may depend on those skills."

","Twelve alien space ships appears in 12 random places on Earth. They don't actually land. They hover like big rocks in the air. No signs of weapon and no manifest intentions. In fact, the Aliens are silent. It's not even clear if there is anybody on board or if they are only big drones learning about Earth and it's dominant species. Who are they? Where do they come from and why have they come? Those are the most important questions for humanity. But the most important question is how do we talk to them? How do we communicate with somebody out of this Earth. After all, we can hardly communicate truly with each other. Dr Louise Banks, played magnificently by Amy Adams goes straight for the basics. Before asking questions in a language we don't understand, we must first understand this language. She must use not only her skills at learning the words and their meanings, but her whole life experience consisting of a failure of communication with her husband and the love for her daughter who died of cancer while still young. We sometimes fail to understand that the insights we get from our life story are also important in moving on to the tasks we set for ourselves. While humans predictably panic and descend into conspiracy theories, she takes chances communicating with the Aliens, helped by her physicist companion. But communications with the octopus-like Aliens has to be done through a transparent wall. Words are exchanged through writings on pads and the Aliens throwing their own words on the wall. All across the world other humans are trying also to communicate with the Aliens. Soon, communications break out between nations and vital knowledge of what the others are doing is unavailable. The atmosphere renders well this breakdown in human communications. There is no dark side, just foggy gray inside and outside the ship. Dr Banks and her physicist friend play off each other for every scrap of understanding. Meanwhile the sound effects and the music are perfectly in synch with the action. In the end, it is physic and true communications that wins the day. A beautiful movie, one that plays to the heart and the intelligence of the audience.<br/><br/>Very well done Mr Villeneuve."

The film isn't really a hard science fiction film per-say, but it does explore the importance of language; Amy Adams' Louise Banks embodies this importance and the film covers her story and her constant flashbacks of her late daughter. And these flashbacks are actually important to the conclusion of the story.<br/><br/>Louise Banks is brought along by the US Government to communicate with the UFO's inhabitants: these arachnid-like aliens who speak a language that reads both forwards and backwards; they speak a language that transcends all of Earth's tongues and it actually reads time and space. These aliens provide some answers for Louise's struggle as a mother losing her child. It's revealed that because she learns the language by the end of the story that she actually saw the future, and thus it seemed like these 'memories' kept seeping into her thoughts. She hasn't had her daughter yet, she isn't even married yet; and her ability to see the future prevents China's leader from retaliating against the alien threat, thus resolving the story's big problem.<br/><br/>Arrival is clever, and while its overall story may not make logical sense it is nevertheless a smart and thought-provoking piece on the importance of language to human culture.<br/><br/>P.S.

""Arrival"" had that effect for me.<br/><br/>This is a captivating movie about first contact with aliens and how humans handle our fear of the unknown and go about establishing communication. It's a huge concept, and yes, it's been explored before. I think ""Childhood's End"" by Arthur C. Clarke is the prototype most other stories follow to some degree.<br/><br/>It's completely serious even though life is funny: ""Trust me, you can understand communication and still end up single."" <br/><br/>There are so many clichés involved with ""first contact"" by now that it's hard to avoid all of them. This film has a few. But one of the things I like is that when the aliens leave, it's not in a flash of light and thunder, nor a streak of stars, nor any other display of massive power -- they just fade into clouds and mist. These aliens don't need to impress us with pyrotechnics.<br/><br/>Another thing I like is the low-key approach that Amy Adams' character uses to establish communication. There are no hysterics, just quiet competence mixed with brilliant insight. The first word she uses in reaching out is ""human."" <br/><br/>And that leads to the real surprise -- when it turns out that the aliens are just a side story! This is really a story about time, and our perception of time as we sort out the sequence of events in the film. But most of all, it's a story about the strength of a mother's desire for and love of her child -- and the decision to have the child even when she knows the child will not live a normal life. It's about what it means to be human and why humanity survives: <br/><br/>To be human is to love and to love our kids. Any parent will get this."
"billbowiejr","9","1","11","24 January 2017"," Proposition: It's a hypothesis until it's a fact
","The thing interests me most was the symbolic meaning of communication between aliens and the linguist. The communication of different races. I guess that is the intriguing part of sci-fi to me. With the current political and culture clashing of the world, it serves as a refuge of writers - artists even who holds the romanticised view of the world - harmony between races and cultures. The duration of the plot could be seen as a journey of humanity develops a common language of unity. (this could be linked to the circle shape of the alien language)<br/><br/>The screenplay explores the grant concepts as individual life, in this case the main character's life - a middle aged American woman and expands towards the life of a human being. From a perspective of an alien entity, it offers an observation of standing outside the circle (it is called in the movie 'non-linear') hence evoke viewers to stand at a philosophical point for the delivery of the essence of the movie, of the plot of the novel even, raising the question: would you still go through life if you've seen it from start to finish.<br/><br/>The delivery of the images reminds me of how Terrence Malik does it in 'Into the Wonder' with a clever handling of memory flashbacks of the main character. Denis Villenueve is new to me and a happy finding. I like the way he deals with delivery so will go to see his upcoming films.<br/><br/>Amy Adam is always earthy, I guess this is why she charms her fans. She excellently portraits American scholars and the spirit of them. Her earthy charm steals the show.<br/><br/>Brilliant introduction of the novelist Ted Chiang, despite the numerous awards he receives out of his eight novels he managed to deliver us a story line and not losing the spirit of sci-fi."
"sbeall-99056","8","1","11","24 January 2017"," I love these kinds of movies!
","Why? Because I love good thought invoking sci-fi but mostly because these are the movies that when the reviews come out you can easily separate the small-minded folk with no imagination and lack empathy over, well...those who aren't those kind of people. You can imagine as you're watching it all the people who are frustrated with things like conceptual/hypothetical thinking just squirming in their seats when forced to deal with their own shallow incompetence. <br/><br/>The ""Duh, I don't get it, it's got no plot derrrr""...""I don't understand this mumbo-jumbo liberal stuff!"" people with the inability to follow a movie unless it's spelled out for them every 5 minutes, is especially interesting for a movie like this because well, those would be the folks wanting to ""blow it up"" cause of they fear and want to kill things I can't understand or control. Basically, Trump voters...you know, Morons.<br/><br/>People who can't follow this movie without a seeing eye dog and find it ""boring"" are those who probably don't read anything other than twitter feeds and chain restaurant drive through menus. <br/><br/>I know it's frustrating because of the lack of ""spolsions"" or gratuitous T&A shots, but it's a sci-fi drama folks. Please do us all a favor and stick to the remedial level Fast and Furious, Ron Burgundy, or Kung Fu Panda flicks when you decide to choose a movie to watch so we don't have to sort through every other review being a 1-star rated 3rd grade hill billy comment that includes the one word you use often that you think makes you appear intelligent but you either spell it incorrectly, or use it wrong.<br/><br/>That said; they did need to better explain and tie up the lose ends. I know they kind of left it open to interpretation and the film probably ran longer than they wanted but leaving it hang was kind of frustrating. What ""unstoppable"" disease killed her daughter, what was the help humans would give to the Heptapods? Why were the Heptapods ultimately there for? Was it solely to give them the gift of non- linear time so they can help them as well? Other than that, I enjoyed the basic story line and the direction for the most part, as well as the acting. If the movie was about 30 minutes longer, it would have been better."

","So here Arrival it's like Arrival of Aliens so here in this movie Aliens came with his unique ship type something and just wait for some human response and in last they just gone without even doing something or telling something to us i don't get why they come to just teach human how they speak it's doesn't make sense but high IMDb rating which is 8.4 forcing me write a good review but i can't maybe i watched a cam version that's why my review is little negative but whatever i don't like in story why a big think like Aliens and women's personal matter like her story with her daughter got connected it's too doesn't make sense to me well i was little excited after watching trailer that i will gonna see something good like alien will teach us something good something unique however whatever is it movie about it's look much real i thought that's why people liked this much people wants something good real i too want real but i want something different too maybe it is different but not for me well that was a great way when women try to finding out means of aliens symbolic language so they talking with symbol language who knows if they exist but Hollywood really wants incident like this"
"luminescencecreation","10","1","11","13 November 2016"," One of the best movie of 2016 with a hidden message for all to hear (if you listen)
","Went and saw Arrival (Movie) last night, one the best concepts i've seen for a movie that tries to explain what is wrong with our planet today (of course you're thinking another crappy but can't understand this post kind of thing), It talks of aliens showing up at our door step without making contact the 12 ships that landed on our planet landed in 12 different places all in different countries. all of countries had one message 1.(what is your purpose here on earth). Of course they replied back in language the 12 countries couldn't understand, of course when we don't understand things we through sticks and stones at the problem and see where it takes us, China, Russia, Syria (i think) want to destroy their Ships (Shells) because they don't understand.<br/><br/>ONE LANGUAGE is gift to humanity end game is to get humanity to work together and not fight for once, our planet now is riddled with wars & planetary problems such as climate change. They are here to solve this problem not only that they see time very differently to us and give us the chance to fix problem with showing one person something that will have a huge impact on the things to come in the future.<br/><br/>The movie itself has a hidden message for all to discover, when you've finished watching the movie if you really listen and let it take over, the message will come clear to you.<br/><br/>Give this movie a 10/10 for the effort, actors used."
"richard-62034","10","1","12","12 August 2017"," Just Wow!
","Possibly as close to perfect as you can get.<br/><br/>The majority of Hollywood Alien movies are about invasion and how much more advanced other races are / would be / could be / should be. This movie is more about symbiosis and probably more a comment on global politics than most would care to admit.<br/><br/>The movie is a slow burner, with flashbacks to a massive loss for the main character leading up to a breathtaking final 10 minutes. A lot of negative reviews are from people who don't understand what happened. Ignore these people and watch the movie. Use your imagination and listen to the dialogue. Sometimes, the biggest things that happen in movies don't have flashing lights or dramatic music to tell you it has happened!<br/><br/>I watched this movie and sat talking to my wife about it for two hours after. It is slow, but the gift is heartbreaking and a real talking point, especially for the main character and her future."
"donna-dodig","10","1","12","5 March 2017"," A Sci-Fi masterpiece
","I was expecting just another sci-fi movie but my mind was blown away. It's not a movie for everyone because not everyone can understand same things. This movie is not about aliens it is about dimensions we can'see or understand that contain out thoughts, feelings, energies. This is a movie about our contact with those dimensions and only a few can communicate with them and understand them. It sends a strong message about time and love that transcends time and all other laws. It gives a strong feeling about circularity of time and ""past lives"" as we sometime feel like we already know something we shouldn't be knowing the same way as Louise knew things she shouldn't be knowing. I strongly recommend to watch it in peace and to bi 100% in it or otherwise you'll miss the point. A masterpiece for true movie and other dimensions lovers."
"stuartsurr1992","10","1","12","5 March 2017"," Utterly mesmerized by the film... saddened by some responses.
","The film was poetic, meaningful and educative. Someone described it as harmonious, how all the different aspects of the film came together. Another described it as a concept and focus which no other film has been able to achieve and yet still, there are people who just cannot see this.<br/><br/>You have to be open-minded. If you enter a cinema wanting something specific from a film, you're most likely not going to get it. Simple. Who wants a film to be generic and predictable? I don't. Well, I say this yet there's an endless conveyor-belt of generic s*** which gets released each week. It's become the norm.<br/><br/>So I suggest you watch this, make up your own mind and see for yourself which others were too closed-minded to see."
"ray-331-768935","10","1","12","26 January 2017"," yes
","Finally a true masterpiece for grown up, humane and intelligent audiences, where the true here is language and communication, love it. We have all been watching and loving stories for years. We are all the toughest connoisseurs. This movie heralds the needs for females in leads, balances emotion with irrationality and childishness. Makes a lovely stab at realism. Keeps us in suspense and entertained all the way. Is Different. Is simple but yet complex and makes us think. Has no hero per say, but warms to humanity in a way that only few films can. Its a study of mind and heart. But most of all, its tense; It flips through time like no other film I have seen but maintains interweaving effortlessly. The script is brilliant, the acting is brilliant, the music is brilliant, and the story more than satisfies. I think this is a masterpiece."
"sexysocks01","10","1","13","7 March 2017"," Absolutely beautiful, unique in the current box office climate
","In today's cinema when you here the words 'Alien Invation' you think of global apocalypse and potential obliteration of the human race. This film is not that! If you want guns, explosives and mass destruction of cities this film won't give it. It's not your typical alien flick, I do admit i went into it expecting those things and spent the majority of the first hour waiting for the laser to appear, waiting for the main scientist guy to suddenly have skills with a gun that is just unfeasible in the real world, for someone with no training; but you know what, that moment never came and I thank the writers for that. Because I sat down expecting another dull action film to while away the afternoon and instead I got a beautifully made piece of cinematic mastery. This film isn't in line with the stuff that comes out of the box office nowadays, its leagues above it and to be honest it would sit more comfortably next to the type of cinema that you get at the Sundance festival and it's counterparts. I'll say again, if your looking for some gun toting aliens and a beautiful girl playing damsel in distress, look elsewhere, this film won't give it. But if you want to see one of the most thought provoking films to come out of popular modern cinema look no further because this film really makes you think about what may actually happen if aliens did come to earth, if you ignore all the stuff about time and mystic languages."

","This is a very good movie. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie has your mind thinking entire time. The actors did an amazing job. They definitely got the right people to play the characters. Amy Adams really performed her character as if she was her character. As you are watching it you are trying to figure it out with the characters and once the end comes then you just sit there for three minutes with your jaw hanging open while you are trying to figure it out. This movie is nominated for Best Picture and it really deserves it. This is the only movie worth the Best Picture in my opinion. This movie is definitely a must see. It is definitely worth the ten stars."
"jboothmillard","6","1","34","20 November 2016"," Arrival
","I saw the trailer for this film, I was excited by both the concept and the impressive cast, and then Film 2016 recommended it as Film of the Week, so I was definitely going to see it, directed by Oscar and BAFTA nominated Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario). Basically twelve mysterious extra- terrestrial spacecraft, nicknamed ""shells"" by the U.S. military, have touched down in locations across the globe. One of these locations is Montana, linguist Dr. Louise Banks (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Amy Adams) is approached by U.S. Army Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker), due to her skills in translation and her existing high level security clearance, to join a special team created to analyse the alien species. The team includes theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), their mission is to enter the shell, to make contact with the cephalopod-like aliens, called 'heptapods' because of their seven limbs, and uncover the reason for their arrival, the two creatures are nicknamed Abbott and Costello. Louise decides two- way communication is impossible, however she discovers the creatures can communicate using written language, through a series of complicated circular symbols with inter-related components. With Ian's help, Louise wants to determine the aliens can understand thought and reason, she learns that the symbols correspond to a basic English vocabulary, she hopes to build an understanding and eventually ask their reason for being on Earth, while doing all this work Louise is having visions of her daughter. Louise feels proficient to ask the beings, using the language, what they want, they answer, and the reply contains the words ""offer weapon"", other nations translate their versions of what this message means, fearing this is a threat and with friction caused communications between nations are closed down. While Louise questions if the aliens actually mean a weapon as a ""tool"", rogue soldiers take matters into their own hands and plant C4 within the shell, the scientists are unaware of the explosive device, it is detonated during a communication, Costello leaves before it blows, while Abbott saves Louise and Ian from harm. After recovering, and the shells moving higher into the sky, Ian determines that their messages relate to the concept of time, meanwhile the Chinese military are preparing to attack their shell, followed by those in Russia, Pakistan and Sudan, General Shang (Tzi Ma) of China has threatened the shell will be destroyed in 24 hours if it does not leave. Louise returns to the Montana shell, and is taken aboard by a small shuttle, Costello tells that Abbott is dying, and Louise is told that her visions of her daughter are from the future, these are flash-forwards not flashbacks. Costello tells that their purpose on Earth is to ""help humanity"" by sharing their language and its power to change the perception of time, the ""weapon"" or ""tool"" they were offering, and the aliens have foreseen they will need humanity's help in 3000 years in exchange. Louise returns to camp and has a new vision of an event in the aftermath of the alien visit, where she meets with General Shang and they talk about communicating and what she did to convince to stop the attack, back in the present day she steals a satellite phone to call the General, the words she speaks are that of the flash-forward, repeating his dying wife's last words. In the end the shells dematerialize into thin air, the nations restore communication and share information they have learned with each other, and Ian admits to Louise he has fallen in love with her, he is in fact the father to her future daughter, Louise knows that their child will eventually suffer an incurable disease, but she does not want prevent her from existing. Also starring A Serious Man's Michael Stuhlbarg as Agent Halpern and Mark O'Brien as Captain Marks. Renner and Whitaker are good in their parts, but this film definitely belongs to Adams, who is great as the linguistics professor with an emotional background (more accurately future), this is no Independence Day, no huge spectacle of an alien movie, it is is unhurried story of deciphering an alien language and finding out what they want, the small amounts of special effects are well done, I will honest and say that it went a little over my head towards the end, and it is close to Contact with its themes, but overall it is a worthwhile science-fiction drama. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Original Music for Jóhann Jóhannsson, Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Good!"

","I remembered this movie from somewhere and then I realized that I had watched 30 minutes of it previously and turned it off because it was too boring.<br/><br/>The movie is just that: boring. Nothing really ever happens. The movie is totally unrealistic in many ways. The protagonist keeps going in and out of the spaceship, but when she finally figures out what the aliens are there for (which is also a very strange reason), the camp is already being evacuated and the aliens leave again. The whole movie made no sense. I felt terribly disappointed afterwards."

","Many sci-fi movies have a high brow premise that seems entirely unbelievable. Arrival did much better on this front and I was drawn in by an interesting and original idea. Unfortunately, some of the performances and screen writing almost drove me away. Almost every conversation felt forced and scripted. All military characters were portrayed as idiots with a lust for combat. Some of the lines that were meant to be forceful came out flat and seemed misplaced. The score, cinematography, and special effects were a bright spot.<br/><br/>The last 20 minutes of the movie were engaging, but I'm sorry to say I almost stopped watching during the first 10."

","The first time I saw Arrival, I fell asleep. The second time, I didn't. Denis Villeneuve continues to impress his audience after Prisoners and Sicario (the latter I saw but not reviewed yet). The cinematography is what we expect Villeneuve's films to be like. It's stunning. The performances especially Amy Adam's performance. Don't go into the film excepting big laser battles and action because this is a slow-paced film. That's one little criticism I have with this film. It's a little slow. Also, the plot for some people may confuse people. It requires a second viewing upon first viewing. It took me a while to think about this review. Also, I can't stress enough how much this film reminds me of Shutter Island. I mean come on! They both use the same song ""On the Nature of Daylight"". The plots both seem familiar to each other. But hey, that's just my opinion. Overall, Arrival is a wonderfully directed film, with a great cast, and stunning production design. It's also a film that plays with our minds. And in my opinion, it succeeds at that."

The main focus is not on action and how they fight a superior race but on science and practical thinking. Aliens arrive on earth, what do we do? Communicate. Find solutions. Negotiate. People get scared, they demonstrate. Countries don't work together but work for themselves and some shout war way to early. Everything is so realistic and if you're interested in science, linguistics, what ifs and learning stuff this is your movie.
Obviously there is this twist and you could argue that it makes it less realistic but if there really are aliens on this earth, how is this more unrealistic than that. For all we know time is relative.
The movie also has a great message and all in all is the best scifi movie I've ever seen."

","This isn't a typical alien movie. The plot is very cerebral. It can be hard to follow at times, because there isn't much segue between scenes. They'll explain something complicated very fast and it doesn't give you much time to process what just happened before they move on to the next thing. It's like that matg teacher who after explaining a complicated concept asks ""Does everyone understand?"" and moves on even if only 1 kid said ""Yes."" The plot has a lot of subtle forshadowing, some of which came from supposedly throwaway lines that ended up being important later on. The twist at the end was very well concealed, although I would have liked them to explain the reasons for why this twist can happen. It was brilliant, but came out of nowhere.

","My Expectation<br/><br/>I had already heard a lot about this movie from my brother, Vishesh, as well as heard the huge amount of Oscars Nominations it had gotten. So I was already on board to watch it and excited to. But I had no idea how much more its going to be about. I was technically under the impressions it will be sci-fi action movie but it turned out to be something similar to Interstellar. Intelligent Sci-Fi. Sci-Fi and Drama.<br/><br/>Prior to approaching this film, a word of warning that it is what many like to call a ""thinking person's sci-fi"". If you're going to watch this, I beg that you dedicate your utmost attention to it, as it is truly one rewarding experience, one of the smartest, most well-constructed science fiction marvels of recent years. 'Arrival' is Villeneuve's magnum opus.
Based on the ""The Story Of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang<br/><br/>
My Review<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve blew up the cinematography experience with this movie. I didn't have words left to explain what happened. Only someone like Denis can create the thrill, suspense and tension with the camera, music and lighting, without even showing the actual aliens for as long as the first half of the movie.
The suspense and the tension created was probably one of the best part of the movie. Although based on a short story, the story wasn't anything long or complicated, but rather quite short and simple. Extending it, and that to beautifully for the screen the way he did requires a lot of talent. There is minimal use of computer generated images, and main focus on story, characters, acting and thrilling scenes. And that's the highlight of this movie. How to show aliens and their impact without showing them!<br/><br/>In Arrival there is no action, no explosions, just some amazing acting performances combined with good directing, editing and cinematography. There was not a single moment I felt bored.<br/><br/>The slow pacing of this film worked perfectly it helped to build up the slow burning suspense and gave the characters more time to be developed better. The special effects in this film are also fantastic mainly because they are used sparingly as it is clear that the focus is more on the characters. Denis Villeneuve did such an amazing job directing this film he really sucked you into the situation and made it seem more life like.<br/><br/>This film asks a lot of questions about humanity and how it interacts and these questions are incredibly intriguing and thought provoking it forces the audience to think on real life and accurate the events of this film are to real life. The whole mystery of why the aliens are here is done perfectly you're more that likely to change your mind at least once and when a mystery like that is built up for so long it's hard to make the eventual discovery satisfying but in this case it was, the eventual reveal makes you look at this film in an entirely different way, the film also doesn't feel the need to answer every question it asks leaving certain things ambiguous that allows the viewer to think on their own answers.<br/><br/>The acting by all the actors is simply mind-blowing and very natural and realistic acting. Overall, I'd recommend this movie to everyone as it is definitely once a watch and on a completely different theme in respect to aliens with a fresh and realistic story.<br/><br/>How It Impacted Me<br/><br/>Well first of all, I was deeply intrigued by the fact that language is what makes our reality what it is right now. The fact that a language defines how a person might think even! And the impact our language can have. Like we currently don't even have words to describe certain emotions or feelings we feel right now in English. And because we cannot define it, we cannot identify them when we do feel properly. If our language had words for it, we would be talking about those feelings and maybe addressing them too. Similarly the concept that the language can be non linear and can change our perspective of time being linear also. The concept is very deep and thought provoking and I just was really amazed by it."

"Sir Gerry","8","0","1","3 March 2020"," Your words create your reality
","I don't think this movie is about that ""what makes us human"". Personally I think it is about creating your own reality. The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (""For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned""). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully."

I guess the movie just isn't that everyone. it reminded me of Interstellar, which I also found somewhat confusing while watching it for the first time. I've seen each of these movies several times now and I guess I picked up a little bit more information with each viewing.

","Arrival directed by Denis Villeneuve is one of the best Science Fiction movies In recent years. Every single shot in this film is absolutely stunning. The large establishing shots of natural landscapes presented in quite muted colours, covered in blankets of mist is dripping with jaw dropping beauty. The story is a clear reflection of our current context, giving caution and direction for our future. The screenplay is intelligent, and so unique. Amy Adams in this film gives one of her best performances in my opinion, playing a linguist who is insanely overworked. The audience is made to feel everything she does, as if we are inside her mind. Also the score by Johan Johansson is eerie, chilling and almost ghostly. It works extremely well in the very quiet and mysterious tone of the film. The twist which comes to fruition towards the end, is simply genius. No spoilers of course, but it worked so well due to the talented film makers. It's a twist which makes you look at the entire film differently after attaining the new knowledge... literally it was as if my mind was on a rollercoaster when I figured it out. Unfortunately Arrival isn't completely flawless. One of my issues being being the role of Jeremy Renner. He kinda has a significant role, but in terms of the issue at hand, he literally does nothing. There's also another scene where a character breaks certain protocol and everyone is after them. But then what they are doing is completed, so they obey and everyone forgets about it. I feel like it was just there to build tension and make the scene more exciting. All in all I love this film. It benefits from multiple viewings. It's a film which plays with your mind and I love that. Arrival is incredibly well made and contains a great story so therefore I give it an 8."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","0","1","12 March 2019"," A fantastic, cerebral, and realistic approach to a classic sci-fi scenario.
","Despite all the mindless action and sex that hits the big screen every year, every once in a while there comes a film that's a little more . . . cerebral. Arrival (2016) certainly fits this category. Not only do you really have to pay attention to what's happening in this film, it makes you question how we perceive our world as it is right now. Never before have I seen the topic of encountering alien life forms approached from such a realistic and logical way. It makes sense that we wouldn't be able to understand them, so the first step in establishing an understanding is to establish communication.<br/><br/>Much like Christopher Nolan, who has done a number of great, ""cerebral"" films including Memento (2000), Inception (2010), and Interstellar (2014), I have recently come to appreciate the directorial talents of Denis Villeneuve. From his previous films like Prisoners (2013) and Sicario (2015), I've seen him deliver powerful messages about who we are as humans and how we deal with evil. In Arrival, once again the enemy is humanity itself, and the angry and violent mistrust it has against anything it doesn't understand. Fortunately, despite its repeated visual motif of black and white, Arrival shows that peace can be found in the gray area of language interpretation.<br/><br/>While I don't want to give away the twist of this film, I have to say that the way it was presented certainly makes for a powerful impact once it has been realized. I will simply attribute this to the talent of Denis Villeneuve and the superb screenplay used to guide the audience along to the stunning conclusion. If you haven't seen any of Villeneuve's films yet, now's a great time to start. I certainly will look forward to his next piece, if this is the type of work he's putting out right now.<br/><br/>A fantastic, cerebral, and realistic approach to a classic sci-fi scenario, I give Arrival 5.0 stars out of 5."

Plus, it is a story within a story; nit an easy film to fully grasp the first time I saw it. It took a 2nd screening to really have it sink in. I especially like the fact that instead of ""dumbing down"" this film, they assumed a level of higher intelligence from the audience, which is (partially) why it works so well. Denis Villeneuve is on top of the director's world right now. I don't care hiw many awards are given to Alfonso Cuaron (too many). Villneuve is by far ahead if everyone. Amy Adams is so perfectly cast in her role, also. In fact, Villneuve wouldn't make the film without her; he insisted that she get the part. Luckily fir the studio and producers, she was available. I dont want to reveal anymore than I already have (such is not too much). Also, Villeneuve's favorite conductor, Johanne Johansson has a stunning score, as well. Enjoy; on many levels, too."

"leftistcritic","10","0","1","12 February 2019"," Thoughtful, unlike other Alien-Human Contact Films
","I have been watching a number of similar films recently, from 'Contact' to 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' This movie is different. It is not a white person's fantasy as much as the others but is more of a movie about how the aliens think, about language, about the change of time (past, present, and future). I remember being blown away when I first saw it back in 2016 and I still feel that affect. Amy Adams leads the movie as the protagonist while Ryan Reynolds is a good supporting character. The aliens are not like those in Close Encounters or those in War of the Worlds, but rather they have a mission to unite humanity together, something which the character played by Amy Adams (Louise) helps to push along. The movie is still strong and a good piece of science fiction...that really makes you think.<br/><br/>I do have one question however: if Louise can see in the future can she not see her own death? If so, that would be deeply disturbing. Perhaps the movie purposely did not go to that place.<br/><br/>Sure humanity is together at the end but at what cost? There is martial law in the streets of the U$ and constant looting, mass suicide by a religious cult, and unrest across the world. Yet this somehow barely affects them in Montana (or anywhere in the world)...why? Do we really need a group of elites to save humanity? Can't humans save themselves? That is what is concerning aboit this movie. Additionally the military is handling this operation and has somehow not engaged in a use of force yet? Come on. Why would the alien land in the U$? That is the last place they would want to go.<br/><br/>Still, I would definitely watch this movie again as it clearly has powerful themes without a doubt. That is all."

And even if I had known earlier in my life what heartbreak was in store for me in exchange for the irreplaceable moments of joy, I would not change a single thing.<br/><br/>There will be moments of confusion for you as you kind of try to figure out where in time you are, but it'll turn out that doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Amy Adams with her grace and quiet strength brought me to tears, and as other reviews will mention, I was not bored for a single moment, despite a slow pace and no terribly deep dialogue.

Anytime you need a random voice over to explain the story, you aren't doing a good job of writing the story.

"hiseinman","10","0","1","16 January 2019"," A strange thing is memory. It works differently than I thought. We are all captured by time, by its inexorable move.
","""Arrival"" is a sci-fi tape from Canadian master Dani Villeneuve, who for the first time works in this genre, but copes with it like a brave veteran. This is a stunningly beautiful, touching, piercing and even meditative film that gives the viewer an unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>One of the best linguists on the planet performed by Amy Adams is picked up in the middle of the night by the US military in order to find a common language with one of the twelve suddenly appeared alien ships. Along with her, the physicist is being played by Jeremy Renner, who, for the most part, is assigned the role of assistant. The general, played by Forrest Whitaker, demands that scientists find out from aliens as quickly as possible what the purpose of the latter is on our planet. In parallel, we are told the story of the personal life of the heroine Adams, and somewhere in the background, through TV broadcasts, you can watch the economic and political crisis occur on Earth. Surprisingly, none of these lines turns out to be superfluous, and by the end they merge into an amazingly beautiful and skillful piece, where there is not a single extra detail.<br/><br/>Frankly speaking, this is a classic film of the ""Hollywood period"" by Dany Villeneuve - a dark, tedious, tense and intriguing movie, where it's unclear to the very end how it all ends. But if in previous works Villeneuve kept the final twist right up to the final, then in ""Arrival"" this twist is incredibly smooth and it is designed not to surprise the viewer, but to make him collect the overall picture in his head. And it damn well works for this movie.<br/><br/>Villeneuve himself called his tape ""a slow striptease,"" and it's really better not to invent a comparison. Some aliens have to wait quite a long time to see in all its glory, but they are made amazingly. The language of aliens is no less effectively made by their way of communicating, which is really very different from human. But the communication problems of two civilizations will be of interest to absolutely everyone, not just linguists - after all, the language in ""Arrival"" has tremendous plot importance, and after watching you want to immediately learn it, or at least translate a couple of sentences.<br/><br/>In the end, you understand that ""Arrival"" is really something like the cinematic equivalent of a symphony, which in the final reaches incredible harmony and polyphony. All elements of this tape, previously played separately, begin to sound together and are connected into something single and indivisible. If up to this point it is still possible to resist the ""Arrival"", then at the time of the denouement, Dany Vilev completely disarms the viewer, leaving him on the direct path to the catharsis.<br/><br/>Much more could have been written about Amy Adams' awesome game (give her an Oscar already!), Johann Johannson's terrific music or Bradford Young's hypnotic camera work, but the fact that ""Arrival"" is so holistic, so harmonious work, that ""dissect"" its parts simply have no desire. Harmony in the film is generally one of the key themes, and Villeneuve succeeds not only to show it on the screen, but also to embody it in the film itself.<br/><br/>However, the most surprising thing about the ""Arrival"" is in the other. ""Science fiction"" of this movie turns out to be just a screen, behind which lies the real story about a person, love and free will. Dani Villeneuve managed to create a fascinating structure and at the same time an incredibly deep almost philosophical ribbon that absolutely everyone will be able to understand, because the theme that the director comes to in the final is all that is close to each of us.<br/><br/>P.S. And ""Arrival"" is the case when the movie wants to be revised again, as soon as it ends."
"leftistcritic","10","0","2","14 January 2019"," Best alien movie I have ever seen
","This movie really blew me away. Amy Adams' performance and her ability to smash down barriers put before her, in terms of things the military didn't want her to do, was powerful. She really carried the movie. These aliens are unlike any in other movies I have seen. How? They came to Earth in order to unite humanity and they believe that time is cyclical, not a straight line. This was great as it broke down the common stereotype of aliens, saying that if we communicate together, work together, we can get more than fighting. Also, I liked the dig at the person watching a Rush Limbaugh type character who I think is killed by the aliens or something, if I remember right, who totally deserves it.<br/><br/>All in all, I would definitely watch this wonderful movie again."
"morpheas-01270","9","0","1","7 January 2019"," Close to a masterpiece, a true work of art
","Arrival is an outstanding piece of work, and overall it impressed me in a way that other films havent, for a long time. Watching it made me feel that I discovered a hidden gem, and I feel fortunate for such a discovery.<br/><br/>However, it suffers from certain inconsistencies/plot holes, as I will attempt to demonstrate in this review, with a few examples:<br/><br/>Inconsistencies/Plot Holes
The biggest issue that I found, was that of the ""gift"" that Louise receives from the aliens.
<ul><li>We are told that Louise receives a ""gift"" or ""weapon"" from the alien heptapods, and what that is, is the power to see the future, as is claimed in the movie.</li></ul>Louise can see what will happen later on in her life, and she can see that in the form of visions that come to her out of nowhere, and these visions often resemble memories of things that havent happened yet but they will supposedly happen in the future. It is as if she is getting the memories that will form in the future, but she's getting bits and pieces of them in advance.<br/><br/>Now here's the problem with that:
One of the key elements in the story, was Louise's action to call General Shang, and change his mind. Without that plot part, the whole story basically falls apart.
But Louise doesnt have a way of contacting Shang and doesnt have a clue what would change his mind.
The way that Louise achieves this, is by getting a vision of General Shang literally showing her his personal phone number, that can be used to reach Shang directly, at any time. Shang also tells her (in the vision) what she told him to change his mind: his wife's dying words.
If Louise sees the future, how could it be that she acquired Shang's phone number and his wife's dying words in the first place?
The vital key information that Louise extracts from that vision is required in order to change Shang's mind. If that vision is what will happen in the future, then that future is impossible because she needs the vision in order to get that information. Its a paradox, and its circular. It simply doesnt make sense, its illogical.<br/><br/>A much better explanation that doesnt create paradoxes, is that the vision isnt of something that happens in the future, but simply a way for Louise to gain that vital key information (phone number and wife's words).
So its a false vision, not a vision of the future, but something imaginary that comes to her simply because she needs it. But who's giving her that vital info?
It could very well be the aliens, but if that is the case, then the aliens are simply directing Louise to do what they want her to do. They are implanting those visions in her head, and then fool her into thinking that she has some magical power of seeing the future.<br/><br/>In the vision in question, Louise is told by Shang that she was able to change his mind by calling him on his private phone number, and that Shang himself doesnt know how she got his number. Louise, even in the vision, acts surprised, and she genuinely doesnt know what Shang's phone number is. So much so, that she even tells him ""I dont know your private number"", so Shang has to show the number to her on his cell phone.
Then he tells her ""Now you know"". So Shang himself was aware that she doesnt know, in that vision.
Also, he tells her that she told him his ""wife's dying words"", and he does so right before he wispers in her ear everything she told him.
These things wouldnt have actually taken place if such an event happened.
Shang, in the vision, was telling Louise what she needed to know in order to change his mind. All Louise has to do, was follow those simple instructions:
A) Call Shang on his private phone number that she just received, and
B) Repeat verbatim the words that he tells her, as he tells her, in the vision.<br/><br/>Conclusion? The vision never happens, not in the past, present, or future.
Louise is basically told what she needs to do to change General Shang's mind.<br/><br/>But who tells her? The film never answers that question. We are left to assume that its the aliens, as it seems to be the most (or only) likely explanation.
This is actually one of several questions that arent answered in the film.<br/><br/>Moreover, Louise has already been having many visions of her spending time with a little girl, who is apparently her daughter. She also sees that she has this daughter with her husband, Ian.
These are things that havent yet happened, and we are told that she sees the future with that gift of hers.<br/><br/>The problem with that is, it isnt really a future, until she makes it so. In other words, its A possible future, with many other possibilities as well, but those possibilities cant be seen by Louise through visions.<br/><br/>Louise only sees one possible future, and it is a future that can easily be avoided:
<ul><li>Should she decide to not get romantically involved with Ian, and it instantly goes away.</li><li>Should she also decide to not have a baby with him, and all the parts about her having a daughter also vanish.</li><li>Her daughter has an incurable, unspecified, fatal illness, and dies. She can also avoid that, by having an abortion early on, and then trying for another baby.</li></ul>The chances of all of her children having the same illness and dying are very slim.
To eliminate those chances, she and Ian can adopt a baby and that way they wont lose their child at such a young age.
<ul><li>Ian leaves her after she tells him something that he didnt like hearing. What was that, we are not told, but whatever it was, she can choose not to tell him, and Ian will probably not leave her.</li><li>If Louise chooses to....you get the picture.</li></ul><br/><br/>What I'm getting at, is that there is no pre-determined future, even according to the film's own narrative, so what Louise sees, is a potential future that can easily be avoided if you know important parts of that future.
So why this future? And why not change it if you can?
The explanation given is very poor, almost not an explanation at all. Because thats what it means to be human? Surely pain and suffering are part of the human condition, but not voluntarily so. We dont opt for suffering, we try to avoid it as much as possible.<br/><br/>Perhaps Louise decided to do this, because even though she will suffer when her daughter dies, all of the time that she spends with her while she's alive is priceless, and she doesnt want to give that up.
But again, what if she can have that with another child, and not have to give up anything?
Again, Louise sees only 1 possible future. Who knows what would happen if she got romantically involved with another man?
Or be with Ian, but adopt a baby?
Its all very problematic, to say the least.<br/><br/>Also, this language that she's given, she later on starts teaching it in classes, and she even writes a handbook on it.
This, along with the visions, are given to her by the aliens.<br/><br/>The most logical conclusion, is that Louise is actually directed by the aliens to do certain things and live a certain life.
Why give her these visions? Why give her this universal language? Why give her the information that she needs to change Shang's mind?
It is much more likely that these aliens want certain things to happen on earth, and they are working through Louise, they are changing things by proxy.
Louise is merely someone who is more receptive and more likely to make it happen.<br/><br/>But what is this strange gift? It seems more like a magical power, more like what a psychic would claim to have (more on this later).
And how can those aliens have this power, and even give it to someone else without so much as touching them?
Remember, that Louise is having visions BEFORE she enter's the room with the aliens inside the spaceship.
She actually receives that power or ""gift"" and she doesnt even realize it.<br/><br/>In spite of all of that however, Arrival is actually an excellent film and an even better work of art:<br/><br/><ul><li>Amy Adams successfully carries the film on her shoulders, but without overshadowing everything else. Her acting is superb, maybe even downright perfect, I might say, with her natural ability to convey innocence and sweetness, to a pretty damn real level. Her facial expressions, as well as her verbal and non-verbal cues are spot on, and you get the impression that this is a real character that you are able to connect with.</li></ul>I strongly believe that no one could actually do a better job than Amy Adams in the starring lead role of this movie.
It is as if she was born for this role, I may even be willing to say that the role was written specifically for her.<br/><br/><ul><li>The rest of the cast are there to support Amy, but they are also very good, especially Jeremy Renner (Ian) who acts as Amy's co-star, but not having as much burden on his acting shoulders. Even though Amy is tasked with doing most of the heavy-lifting, the supporting cast dont seem to be irrelevant and shouldnt be ignored, as they are all able to do their acting jobs a lot better than you'd expect.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cinematography is just stunning, with some aerial shots seeming too damn spectacular, even for a movie of this caliber. The most impressive part of this film however, isnt just great camera-work and angles; no, it goes way beyond that. Director Denis Villeneuve and everyone who worked on this film should feel proud of themselves, as the cinematography is downright some of the best work I've seen in all my years watching movies.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The soundtrack is very strong, emotional, dramatic, but without overdoing it.</li></ul>The song at the beginning and ending of the film is so emotionally charged, and it fits so well with the entire theme and plot of the film, that it is as if the song was composed specifically for Arrival, even though it wasnt. It isnt even a new track from Max Richter, and it actually dates back to being released in an album that is well over a decade before the film came out.
Yet in spite of that, Max Richter's ""On the Nature of Daylight"" fits so damn well with the film, and it manages to make a relatively not-so-impressive ending truly spectacular.<br/><br/>Well done :)

","Sort of like a pretentious version of 1997's ""Contact,"" Denis Villeneuve's science-fiction drama arrives with the seriousness of a Stanley Kubrick genre offering, but the weak plot and screenplay can't sustain the humorless tone. Amy Adams is mostly wasted in the lead role, while Jeremy Renner is rather miscast as a milquetoast scientific professional.

However this kind of storytelling leaves a lot of unanswered questions.<br/><br/>With several turning moments in the films, the whole film becomes a philosophical argument of the concept of time, making it so the viewers aren't left without a point to think about.

","Arrival is a beautifully layered approach to the typical sci-fi theme. Much like Adams' character Dr.Banks chiding the scientific Donelly on starting with the basics of communication, the movie seems to be lecturing the genre about the inordinate focus on how aliens look, what their materials are etc and not asking the more basic questions. It conveniently allows the plot to avoid answering those questions, and it works as the viewer is able to suspend judgement on those points. <br/><br/>But in focusing on the broader narratives it's let down by the more simple storytelling detail, such as the initial scenes of Whitaker meeting Adams, and the incredulity of Adams learning the aliens language."

"ikizdevran-882-254684","7","0","1","4 August 2018"," Why are they here?
","There are some films that tell you a story, and there are some films that impose an idea. ""Arrival"" enters in the list of films that share and impose an idea. Before talking about its idea, I have to say that even though ""Arrival"" is a science fiction drama film, it has nothing to do with classic science fiction examples. Its atmosphere is calm and very much focused on the message it shares. In my opinion ""Arrival"" is one of the best films of 2016 and one of the best science fiction films of all times. It brings an enormous difference to the sci-fi genre. ""Arrival"" chooses communication over action, and this brought the film eight Academy Awards nominations including, Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Achievement in Cinematography. It won only one of them which is Best Achievement in Sound Editing. I don't know the criteria about sound editing or sound mixing but now, when I think about the soundtracks, it makes a perfect sense to me what they mean by sound editing and sound mixing. I have enjoyed the performance of Amy Adams, as a talented linguist, and even though this performance goes unrecognized by the Academy, she manages to get herself a nomination in the Golden Globes for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture Drama. ""Arrival"" is based on 1998 short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang. It is directed by Denis Villeneuve, who is known to be also the director of Incendies, Prisoners and Blade Runner 2049. All these films are in the list of IMDB's top 250 films. Starting with Interstellar and continuing with ""Arrival,"" the change in sci-fi genre has begun and in the near future we can expect more films like this.<br/><br/>What would have happened if one day visitors from other planets would come to Earth? How would we communicate with them? Would we attack them, or would we try to talk with them? How would we understand their purpose? What if they are sharing a friendly message and big capitalist countries ignore it? Basically, this is the idea and exit point of ""Arrival."" One day, twelve extraterrestrial spacecrafts land in twelve locations across the earth. No one knows why they are there and what they want. So, US Army recruits a bunch of people including Louise (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), trying to find out one important answer, ""why they have come to earth"" With different attempts, Louise and Ian manage to communicate with the seven-limbed aliens and find out why they came. They came to help humanity by sharing a language which helps perceive the future and the past for those who can master that language. Louise understands the message when she cracks the code and finds out that each twelve spacecrafts share a part of the message, and in order for the message to be perceived, each country must collaborate and share their piece of message. Eventually world unites and when the message is understood, spacecrafts disappear.<br/><br/>After writing the story a bit detailed, I would like to share the famous idea of the film. It tells us to unite and gather around one civilization in order to go forward as one. This is of course a utopia, but it still makes you think about its benefits. Using the power of past and future, Louise manages to convince Chinese military general not to attack the aliens. With little efforts the world can unite around a language. ""Arrival"" shows us the probability of this. Some people criticized the film for sharing Neo-Liberal propaganda, but in my opinion, the last thing ""Arrival"" wants to do is propaganda. It is using an interesting subject to share a valuable message. It focuses on the importance of time, communication, language and life. It criticizes globalism which creates the biggest problems on Earth.<br/><br/>From performances to the story, from soundtracks to camera angles, ""Arrival"" is a very well-made film. Due to its story, it progresses very slowly, but this is very much expected from a film like this, because it chooses communication over action. If we would learn to communicate before fighting, the world would have been a much better place. This is the most important message that ""Arrival"" shares."
"chi_town_fed","6","0","3","3 August 2018"," A bit underwhelming. Gets points for a different kind of alien encounter.
","This was not the worst movie I've seen. I connected with the linguist and the aliens (to a lesser degree).<br/><br/>The lasting effect on the lead character is a tiresome, overplayed concept. The linguist did a decent job at carrying the movie and pulling me into the story. Although I like Forest Whitaker, I am not certain he was the best actor for the role. His quirks and nuances are unique unto him and do not fit well in certain roles. Those same nuances are why I like him in general. Why not make him one of the scientists instead where his quirks may have been a better fit? Just a thought.<br/><br/>The alien crafts were very cool in their uniqueness as were the aliens themselves and their method of communication. I would have preferred more exposure to the aliens versus the mental travels of the professor.<br/><br/>Reviews are rightfully all over the place (to an extent). I think the extreme (1-2 , 9-10) ratings are not representative of the movie by any fair perspective. I can see a 4 to 8 range of objective ratings. I think it depends on your mood and style preference when you watch this film. A more relaxed mood and nuanced style preference when watching this film might generate a higher rating. A more hyper-mood or need for constant action while watching this film may make it seem more of a disappointment as the action is fairly infrequent. To call this film a 1 or a 10 isn't practical. If you think this is a 10, this means no other movie can top this one and can only, at best, be equally good. If you rate it with 1 star, you are claiming no movie can be worse than this, only equally bad.<br/><br/>I think this film was a bit too heavy in the cerebral arena and fails to give enough exposure to the very unique aliens as well as their technology. I would have preferred more glimpses of them and their perspective versus a few cameo appearances."

","Arrival has an interesting premise. Aliens arrive to planet Earth in 12 different spacecrafts with a mysterious mission, and in the US (which is of course the only location that matters in this film), linguist Louise Banks is brought aboard to decipher their language. Meanwhile, Louise seems to be having increasingly intense flashbacks about her daughter who died and husband who left her.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the filmmakers thought linguistics were too difficult for the audience to understand, or if they didn't really understand them either, but apart from a few key moments, the process Louise goes through to learn the aliens' language is vague and opaque. We don't know exactly how she does it, but a montage later, and suddenly she can speak to them in full sentences. How did we go from concrete, observable language (e.g. walk) to being able to communicate abstract concepts (e.g. purpose)? That part is glossed over entirely. It's still an interesting concept, and the circular way in which the aliens write holds an symbolic purpose, but it's not executed as well as it could be.<br/><br/>While all of this is going on, there are scenes showing world affairs in response to the aliens (called heptapods). The filmmakers made a decision to involve no real-world political figures in the movie, which was probably for the best, but still manages to be distracting. It's all ""the president"" this, ""the president"" that, and a fictional Chinese general now seems to be leader of the entire Eastern world. News segments come across as corny and forced, as does a fictional rightwing conspiracy theorist. Of course, it's the Eastern world that decides to wage war on the heptapods, those unenlightened brutes, and Louise alone has the power to stop them. This all provides the only context and main conflict of the movie, but it is rather dull and contrived.<br/><br/>Then there's the ""flashbacks"" and romance, which are interlinked. Early on, Louise is introduced to physicist Ian Donnelly, who comes across as arrogant, and the two spar a bit. Then they clearly begin to grow on one another. It's a very cliche, albeit subdued (remember, this is a serious film!), romance plot. Ian makes a throwaway line about how language informs our experience of reality (i.e., the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis), which ends up being the key to the whole movie. There's also a key ""flashback"" in which Louise tells her daughter her father is a scientist. While it's all pretty vague, the circular nature of the aliens' language, combined with the fact that Louise has come to think in their language, starts to make it clear that these aren't ""flashbacks."" Ian is her husband, and their daughter dies; because Louise has been given the gift of the heptapods' language, she now sees time as they do, i.e., nonlinearly. Instead of being stuck at a point in time like all humans, she can now see every event in her life unfold. It's a confusing concept, and the film doesn't do much to clarify it.<br/><br/>This all is used to solve the problem with that pesky warmongering General Shang, who gives her his phone number during one of her visions and directs her on what she can say to change his mind (which makes it even more ambiguous how time works in this movie--is having a nonlinear perception of time the same thing as being clairvoyant?). Then the heptapods leave, and Louise finally understands the gift they have given to her. Is it a gift? A thoughtful audience will have more questions than answers. Louise continues on with her life, marrying Ian and giving birth to their daughter, because ""it's the journey, not the destination"" (as the cliche goes). She knows Ian will leave her and her daughter, and then the daughter will die from cancer at a young age. Is it really ethical to give birth to someone who will suffer and die at a young age? As deep as it wants to be, the movie doesn't trouble itself with such questions. It's also not clear if Louise has any free will to stop it--after all, the events she sees are already happening (the nonlinear view of time negates the idea of a separate past, present, and future). Does Louise have any free will at all?<br/><br/>Arrival is a well-made film from a technical standpoint. The cinematography and soundtrack are excellent. The plot has a lot of potential, and there are some interesting moments therein. However, in the end it doesn't add up to the sum of its parts. Its rather slow, light on detail, and the ending manages to be both predictable and confusing. The ending tries to spin Louise's ""gift"" as a positive, but it's hard to buy it."

","After a brief but devastating flashback prologue, spaceships arrive in stationary positions at a dozen locations across the world, and language specialist Louise is recruited by the military to try to communicate with the aliens within. Verbal communication turns out to be impossible, and Louise concentrates on visual communication: the aliens use symbols which look like the stains coffee cups leave. Meanwhile, some of the countries hosting the other ships are getting jittery about their guests...<br/><br/>Arrival is, I think, going to be the new Matrix. Like The Matrix, I fancy Arrival is going to have a lot of people thinking that it is a masterpiece of cerebral science fiction and, like The Matrix, I think it will turn out to contain a good deal less than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Don't let me talk it down too much, though, because it certainly contains some food for thought. The best notion for further examination is that the language you learn in infancy influences the way your thought processes develop, notwithstanding that this was a key concept in Robert Heinlein's Stranger In A Strange Land back in 1961.<br/><br/>I felt that this idea (which drives the concept of the perception of time which, in turn, enables the resolution) was never coherently developed, though, and needed to be spelled out a little more clearly, especially as regards how it tied in with the prologue.<br/><br/>The international paranoia and local xenophobia angles are far more straightforward, albeit straight out of The Day The Earth Stood Still.<br/><br/>The cast are all very good in a film which takes its time to tell a story which, ultimately, is fairly simple. Amy Adams holds centre stage effectively, and Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker provide excellent support. And the visuals are interesting: not especially flashy, but always in service to the story. Denis Villneuve's direction is excellent - I liked this a great deal more than Sicario - and is one of the reasons why people are going to think there is more to this film than there is.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go so far as to say that this film is an example of The Emperor's New Clothes, but it may well be a case of The Emperor's New Underpants.

","One of the great things about science-fiction is its ability to take a look at some aspect of reality to a heightened extent, keeping things grounded while at the same time entertaining. I came across such a thing in the form of the 2016 film ""Arrival"" starring Amy Adams. <br/><br/>Based on a 1998 short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang, it revolves around linguist Louise Banks (Adams), who is brought before one of twelve strange alien vessels and its equally bizarre occupants with the task of decoding their language in order ask one important question: What is their purpose for coming to Earth? <br/><br/>Though small, the cast does a fantastic job portraying characters that are mostly nuanced and relatable. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner especially have great chemistry as they go along this journey of understanding their new visitors, who sport designs and presence that can be best described as, appropriately, ""alien"". The way the creatures communicate is also unique, allowing them to stand out more from your garden-variety extraterrestrials, and the mystery surrounding them is really engaging. The film also pretty much sums up how the world as a whole would react to a situation like this, that is to say going absolutely apes***. <br/><br/>In a way, ""Arrival"" is the perfect blend of simplicity and complexity, the basic ideas easy to understand and the details, once understood, enhance the story. The movie challenges you into questioning your place in the universe and how one can contribute to it despite insurmountable odds. In terms of pure sci-fi storytelling, this definitely ranks high on my list."

The visuals and soundtrack are ok. All in all just a good sci fi flick, but not excellent. <br/><br/>What makes ""Arrival"" special is the suspense.

Villeneuve also directed the new Blade Runner and he knows how to glue an audience to a screen even when not much is happening. Villeneuve has a great talent for creating a contineous suspenseful mood. A strange thing happened the day after I saw it. The scenes with Amy Adams encountering the aliens stayed in my mind the day after. Somehow director Villeneuve's claustrophobic mood lingered on even the next day. <br/><br/>In the end I felt the story was a little too much paranormal and a bit too sweet for my taste.But the suspenseful mood of the movie is impressive. It is a hit or miss depending on your preferences for paranormal stuff and how rational you analyse movies. Villeneuve's direction splits audiences in half, more so than any other director.However smart it is filmed and however suspenseful it stays, it becomes too irrational for my taste near the end, but I dont believe in paranormal stuff, maybe you do...<br/><br/>The message of love however is what makes this movie heartfelt and warm in the end. It's honestly a feelgood movie, but you must be the patient type and have a very open mind to paranormal stuff to be able to appreciate it."

","Some itchy trigger fingers in the writter's room aside: this film is good. I loved the story a lot but didn't feel connected to Adams or Rener (who I normally adore them both). The dreams were unnecessary in my opinion and it is just that, an opinion. I would've been much more satisfied if we could have explored the philosophy more. That being said, I feel this film is a must see because for all the points I mention above, they are outweighed by the story itself."

","The film starts in medias res (sort of) and it seems ""trying to be edgy"" at first. In the beginning, the story moves fast which is great. Too often films try to fill empty spaces with empty scenes. Until close to the end I was conflicted. I couldn't understand why those little ""flashback"" scenes were splattered at random emotional times, but I felt that I could let the cheesiness slide because I love brevity. Sometimes we should try not think when watching films. It cripples the experience. Apart from the thinking/analyzing, I was enjoying the film. I haven't read any other reviews yet, so I am not sure what the general feeling towards the film is but it's an enjoyable and well adapted science-fiction story. I love the film as a science-fiction fan and love the way Villeneuve refers to it as ""dirty sci-fi."""

","Arrival is a film that you have to watch more than once to take in all it's brilliant use of timing. Throughout the movie, the audience is exposed to several different scenes, taking place in the past, present, and future, and we have to puzzle together how it impacts the main character and the overall story. We are taken on a breathtaking journey as we start off in the life of a lonely linguistics professor who gets the opportunity of a lifetime to get to communicate with aliens. Director Denis Villeneuve makes the audience feel the overwhelming emotion that the characters experience through his use of imagery - from the warm, intimate flashbacks in calming scenery, to the cold and foreign environment at the army base and aboard the alien aircraft. <br/><br/>We are introduced to the main character, Louise, through a series of scenes about the tragic death of her daughter. Scenes like this one crop up throughout the movie and the audience is frequently reminded of why Adams's character seems to be so emotionally drained. There seems to be a disconnect between Louise's visions and what is happening in the present. We don't know why Louise is having these visions or how they shape her or the story. It is not until the truth about why she is having these visions is revealed that we understand their importance. <br/><br/>Flashbacks are typically used in films to give us background for a character or plot line, so that we are filled in on knowledge we would not otherwise have. The flashbacks in this film seem to have little context within the present plot of the movie, other than affecting Louise's mood in a negative way. Instead of being giving the audience the power of omniscience, we feel as though we are even further from knowing the truth than the characters are. That is, until it is revealed that Louise is just as in the dark about these visions as the audience. This reveal allows us to be thrown back in the the first person perspective of Louise as we are by her side, trying to solve this mystery together.<br/><br/>Another stunning use of film technique in this film was the mis-en-scène aboard the aliens' aircraft. When Louise and Ian are communicating with the aliens, the scene is framed around the window that separates aliens and humans. The aliens are caged and isolated by this frame, with the humans on the outside, looking in. Other scenes of the window show a side-by-side with Louise on one side and the aliens on the other, showing a closer connection between them than the military, or even Ian have with the aliens. Even the lack of color in the alien communication scenes play an important role, giving the ominous and mysterious feel the environment. Both the frame and black and white color scheme make the alien vessel feel separated from the outside world, as well as fully emerging the viewer into the scene. <br/><br/>The cut-off view of the aliens also plays an important role in the placement of the scene. Whenever Louise and Ian go up into the vessel to communicate with the aliens, they are only able to see the bottom half the aliens through the limited window space. This creates a sense of mystery, and even fear, surrounding these aliens. When Louise is later transported individually into the vessel, she is allowed inside the alien's own compartment, where she is able to see their entire bodies. By taking away the mystery, the fear also disappears, even though we see how giant these creatures are. Louise forms a closer connection to these beings as now the physical and conversational barriers have been taken away. <br/><br/>My only complaint from this film is that some moments can be needlessly cheesy. The love interest between Louise and Ian feels unnecessary, its only purpose being to rope in the flash forwards of Louise's daughter into the story by giving her a father, not really a connection the story needed. The purpose of the aliens being to give us a ""gift"" of communication so that the human race will help them later also seems a bit far fetched and feel-good. In spite of all that, neither of these aspects distracted from the overall brilliance and wonderment of the film.<br/><br/>There are so many things that made this movie so entertaining to watch - from the concept of the story, to the emotion of the characters, to the bewilderment that the audience experiences from start to finish. Nothing in this movie happens by accident - every scene has a purpose and is a piece of the puzzle that is not completed until the very end, and that is what makes this film such a beautifully crafted masterpiece."

","I'm staggered that a good number of people have seen fit to rate this movie as a 1 star offering, and feel sorry for them that they got so little out of the film. Just because a sci fi movie doesn't offer up interplanetary war, goggle-eyed green aliens, laser guns and space ships that can turn a profit in lego sales does not make it dull!<br/><br/>This is a thought provoking film richly deserving of a second viewing and offers a welcome alternative to the regular, formulaic star wars type sci fi offerings. If it's a movie 'for the rest of us' then so be it!<br/><br/>It has it's flaws of course - the actions of the rebellious soldiers is a little hard to believe, and the breakdown of trust among nations and proposed aggression from the Chinese - while believable given the daft world we live in - is rather underdeveloped. But all the film's faults are only faults if you lose sight of the fact that this is a story about Louise. It is Louise, her life, and the decision she must make about her daughter that is the film's focus, not the aliens, space ships, guns or governments. That, presumably, is why those aspects of the story are a little lightweight - to make more room for Louise's story.<br/><br/>The film does play deliberate and clever tricks with what is past, present and future. I'm not very good at understanding the 'wibbley wobbley timey wimey' stuff (most episodes of Dr Who leave me confused enough!), so I was not surprised that I didn't quite get the film on first viewing. But it left me with questions I needed answering, and the answers were there on second viewing. As too was a good deal more emotion and involvement. Watching it for a second time, having twigged the correct order of things and what was coming in Louise's life decision, I found the film deeply engaging and emotional. For example I appreciated much more the beautiful filming of Louise with her daughter Hannah, and I was fully in tune with the unfolding of the story. I rather like the fact that I needed to visit the film twice to fully grasp it, as ultimately that proved much more rewarding.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good old fashioned western-in-space shoot-em-up film this will certainly let you down. Get something trashy, predictable and shallow like like Independence Day on DVD instead. But if you want to watch an intelligent film about a mother's love for her daughter (with some aliens thrown in for decoration) then this might just do it for you. A do watch it twice :)"

","Arrivel has a great direction and acting. It has memorable scenes as the scene of the protagonist's first encounter with the aliens. Yet I do not understand the great acceptance he has been having.
Two excerpts made me very uncomfortable with that film:
There are problems related to communication between the leaders of each country and the soldiers who are in service. Many times the dialogues are forcibly difficult just to move the plot to other places. At least for me the dialogues were poorly written
Another problem I see is the fact that the death of a loved one came back at the end of the story and having an important weight, this made me question the real theme of the film. Is it a film about translation, understanding and above all a new way of understanding of life as a whole as the main character has? Or is it a movie about accepting a loss, being able to accept life as it is? What relationship can we establish between the whole main plot involving communication between aliens and humans and the story of loss of the main character? I understand the point of how she sees the past, present and future with the memories she has of her daughter, but still the story of the daughter seems to me disconnected with the plot of the film."
"alexfinlayson-80821","10","0","1","18 January 2018"," Best Sci-Fi Film of 2016
","Arrival was one of the most original and ingenious science fiction films I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for it before it's release as I'd read it was directed by Denis Villeneuve and, having watched Prisoners, I was already aware of his capabilities as a filmmaker. Plus I noticed the film had a 100% Rotten Tomatoes approval score following it's premiere. I doubted it would last (it didn't) but I knew it was a promising sign.<br/><br/>And when I watched it in the cinema, I was not disappointed. Arrival is one of those films that I would describe as being 'a classic story with a unique twist'. Aliens coming to Earth? That's nothing new. Earth is practically a tourist hot spot for extra-terrestrials. But there have never been any sci-fi films before where the focus has been on communication and language. That may sound boring to some but I was absolutely gripped the whole time.<br/><br/>Although the plot twist towards the end is very memorable, the best moment for me is the first encounter. The darkened setting of the spaceship, Jóhann Jóhannsson's astonishing music score, the breathtaking sound effects and the slow reveal of the aliens gives a recipe that I would class as sci-fi gold.<br/><br/>After watching the film, I decided to read the story upon which it was based and that made me appreciate it even more. The reason being is that there are actually very few similarities between the story and the film which gave me a real eye opener as to just how well Eric Heisserer had done crafting the screenplay<br/><br/>Overall, an absolutely smashing film and certainly a must for any hardcore science-fiction fan"

I thought she was seeing her daughter in flashbacks. In one where she told her daughter 'for science ask your father,' I had an inkling that she was referring to Renner's character. It felt like the filmmaker was messing with time, just like when writer's in stories utilize flashbacks and flashforwards in fiction. I dislike when writers mess with their readers.

"gavinp9","7","0","1","2 January 2018"," Not exceptional, but well-made sci-fi with a twist
","'Arrival' is a different, semi-realistic take on the alien invasion film. It spends a little time introducing us to Louise (Adams), a translator, and then we get to see the UFO that's landed (technically hovering) in Montana. It's one of 12 - she's tasked with opening communications with the aliens. Some great shots of the ships (more like giant smooth rocks) and a good job of showing the different climate/atmosphere in and around them.<br/><br/>It's definitely not your typical alien film - there's a lot of tension and build-up, and no big battles or gory moments. Ian (Renner), a theoretical physicist and Colonel Weber (Whitaker) are there to help Louise, but it's pretty much up to her to determine how to communicate with the aliens (or giant squids). The music can be a bit overbearing at times, and the flashbacks seem to interrupt at times, but it all comes together at the end.<br/><br/>Didn't blow my mind, but it does delve a little deeper into how the world would realistically handle a potential threat of this magnitude. Would have loved to have seen more of the different perspectives from each site/country. An interesting enough reveal, if not totally unique (I've definitely read it in a novel or two before) and a nice message at its core."

","There were so many small problems in this film, they coalesced into one big problem: namely that the movie was not really a creative whole. Mistakes include the casting: Forest Whitaker is too old to play an army colonel. Jeremy Renner, a terrific actor, has his talents largely wasted in a vacuously written character (not much he could do about that). Lots of leaps in logic. It seemed the director wanted to get the film over with after the first half. It just didn't seem to go anywhere. Another issue is that to really understand the 'message' of the film, you need to know something about linguistics. I've studied linguistics and there is a reference made to the 'Whorf Hypothesis' often called the 'Whorf-Sapir hypothesis,' which, if you're not acquanted with it, will probably make you lose sight of the theme or not have the 'insight' about the theme. I won't mention the concept here. It's not that complicated, but if you read up on it, it should help fill in at least some of the holes in the script. In addition, and this isn't a spoiler since it is mentioned in the first 15 minutes of the film, a sizeable number of alien spacecraft land on Earth simultaneously. This trope has been done to death in horror/sci-fi films and on TV, so to make a good film with this premise is all that more difficult."

But the reason I write this is because, Arrival is the perfect example of a science fiction movie. The aliens exist not to bring lasers and incredible visual effects to the screen, but they are a vehicle by which to drive us toward greater musings. Traditional sci-fi movies used outlandish concepts to ask questions like ""What does it mean to be human?"" by exposing us to things that we have yet to experience as a species. Arrival uses the language of these aliens as a new tool to give us insight on similar concepts. <br/><br/>Let me be real frank. This isn't a movie about aliens, it's a movie about grief, shock, and coming to terms with uncontrollable situations. It's a beautifully written narrative which illustrates that we can not narrow in on specific moments and make them define us, but see how they shape us to be part of a greater image. <br/><br/>This is a movie for a patient, thoughtful audience and I would encourage anyone who thinks they fit that bill to watch it."

","+ Amy Adams was magnificent in this film. She played a thoughtful, intelligent and somewhat vulnerable woman (with inner strength) in a movie that served as a vehicle for her.<br/><br/>+ The film itself was, like Amy's performance, thoughtful and intelligent. It pulls you in and keeps you emotionally invested (mostly because of Amy Adams' performance) until the 'reveal/climax' of the film.<br/><br/>+ The Aliens are different from most others we have encountered in films. This alone makes it a worthy sci-fi watch.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters were not fully developed in the least:<br/><br/>I thought Forest Whitaker - who demanded answers, who took orders from superiors who likewise demanded answers - needed to have these interactions explored.<br/><br/>Likewise, Jeremy Renner's character deserved some airtime as the lead ""science-guy"" and his close work with Adams. He, like Whitaker, served as window dressing to Adams. There were no other characters of note in this film... In this sense, the film lacked depth as it was all focused on Adams.<br/><br/>The ending - or rather - the reason for the Alien visit and what that visit meant to the main character was so far-fetched that I could not suspend disbelief. I say this as a huge sci-fi fan who can suspend disbelief on sci-fi B-movie stuff over 1/2 a century old. So it's a good thing I was disappointed at the very end because I enjoyed the film thoroughly up until the great reveal.<br/><br/>Despite some of the negatives, the majority of the film was a pleasure to watch. I was starved for an emotionally rich and thoughtful character and this film filled that void. I wish that the reason for the Alien visit was different because this film would have been an 8 rating. A 9 if the other characters were developed a little more.<br/><br/>The ending itself was atrocious. I would rate this a 6 overall on a first viewing (it's a 9 through the first part, an 8 in the middle and a 3 at the end).

This story is more ""Close Encounters"" and ""Contact"" than ""Independence Day"" or ""War of the Worlds,"" where the main focus of the story is on how to communicate with the aliens, while reassuring the military brass, primarily Forrest Whittaker, that everything is okay and they don't have to attack. This tension of whether they can successfully communicate and avert a conflict with this new species (and whether other countries around the world might tip off an interstellar as well) makes for good ticking time bomb of dramatic tension, but it's really Adams who give the film an emotional human center, desperately wanting to connect with to these advances creatures, while at the same time is haunted by visions of her daughter. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who's next project was the new Blade Runner film, brings a strong visual style to the proceeding, but never in a way that is distracting to the story or style for the sake of style. My only complaint about the film is that it does move at a rather glacial pace, though in the end, the film does deliver with a terrific mind-bending of an ending, that makes the wait well worth it.

The clumsy masses just aren't suited for the kind of intelligent discussions that scientists need to make...those same scientists who said we'd be under water by now.<br/><br/>And when one of our favorite actors shows up, Forest Whitaker, as a Colonel seeking her help, she gives him a snarky comment (""you were quick to take care of those insurgents"")...letting him know right away that liberal Hollywood does not agree with the idea of not allowing insurgents to kill innocent people.

Part of it was keeping track of what happened first. Decades ago I saw a film called ""Two For The Road"". It was the first non-linear sequence film I had ever seen which was really confusing at first, but these days it's not such a big deal. <br/><br/>I did see one critique, which invoked ""Fermat's Principal"" by way of a criticism. I thought that was a unique approach. On the other hand, light has ways of arriving at the same point at the same relative time but at different local times. The lengths of the paths may be greater or lesser but as far as the actual photons are concerned, it all happens instantly because at the speed of light, time has a duration of zero. Is any of this relevant? As far as the story is concerned, not really. I am more interested in relativity, not the Einstein version, but the human version. The later is the myriad ways in which the millions of interconnections of neurons interact with external and internal data in concert with the personal tides of neurotransmitters that build an ever-changing model of the personal universe. This particular movie gives that (my) version of relativity an interesting and rather fun joy ride.<br/><br/>Is the story a stretch? Well, it is Science FICTION, so – Of Course It Is ! <br/><br/>Is there a Stargate orbiting Saturn (or Jupiter if you watched the movie)? Probably not. <br/><br/>Is there a galaxy wide federation that has its center of government on a planet near the galactic core? Unlikely. <br/><br/>Is there a star a few parsecs from here whose life forms live on the inner side of a gigantic rotating ring that is 200 million miles in diameter x 100 thousand miles wide with walls on either side of it 1000 miles high to keep the atmosphere from spilling out into space the whole thing of which is made out of un-obtain-e-um? Ha Ha Ha Ha ha hack cough choke cough wheeze (etc. etc. ending with wheezing and taking a few deep breaths before saying) Oh help! Ugh huh ah - - - - - - - - <br/><br/>But you know what? I loved it, loved them all, not in spite of the ""stretch"", but because of it.<br/><br/>Oh yes, I almost forgot. I have to give it stars. I kind of hate this part. OK, only 9 stars because I had to see it twice to follow the time shifty thing. There, that's my plot give away. Actually, I ought to give it 11 stars because the time thing means that I had an excuse to see it again right away. Hmmmm. Maybe tonight I will get up real early before the Sci-Fi hater gets up so I can see it again."

","Compare it to ""2001"" which is (also) a bit long, boring (in spots) and drawn-out. It's not for the Marvel-DC action-movie fan. Reminiscent of ""Contact"" which is also about an alien encounter. It's a mystery and involves second-sight (premonition) and the reason for our cosmic existence and meaning in the Universe. Part of the following synopsis is paraphrased from ""Wikipedia"", so please do not accuse me of plagiarism. The movie opens with a ""false memory"" as linguist Louise Banks' daughter dies of cancer. But Louise is unmarried and has no child. 12 giant Zeppelin-shaped spaceships hover over 12 different locations all around the world. A team of scientists and military go inside and attempt to establish a common language to find out the 4 basic questions of who, what, where, and why they are here. She and physicist ""Ian"" lead the team. Louise (Amy Adams) has a communication breakthrough with it appears to involve a ""weapon"" as it is mistaken for the word ""tool"". These creatures are 7-legged ""Heptapods"" and resemble giant octopus. Many miraculous events occur: Louise is able to reach Chinese General Shang and an interplanetary war is averted. The aliens impart special secrets about time and space travel. It is unclear if Louise could see into the future before, but now she can. She marries Ian (Jeremy Renner) and she has her daughter ""Hannah"" knowing all along that the young girl will die in her late teens or early twenties. Many questions remain unanswered, such as: what ""favor"" will the Human Race return to rescue these beings in the far future, and is time and life more circular than linear in concept. Best enjoyed ""at home"". I think a large 16x9 TV is perfect, as it's all about the story, not just the special effects."

I was quite impressed with those trailers. I like the Passengers better because it's more entertaining.<br/><br/>What is the movie about?<br/><br/>When everyone is terrified about alien visitors, a linguistics professor Louise Banks insisted and tried to become alien's friend. She solved the puzzles by learning their language. The alien's image is close to octopus, they spray black mist with tentacles, and write their language in circles, different circle represent different meaning, it's a complex language that can interpret causes and effects. Alien came to teach human their circle language because those alien saw the future from their language that they will need helps from human in someday. During the communication/learning processes with the aliens, the professor saw her future, she followed the future screens that she saw to save the Earth. She married the ""future divorced"" partner, knew their daughter would die later and she also would suffer a lot from them, yet she still followed this predicted tragedy.<br/><br/>Why I don't like it?<br/><br/>The movie is about fatalism, and the professor didn't do anything to change her destiny. Also, I found no reason to explain why would she fell in love with the guy, maybe a self-abuse tendency? If not, why would someone step to the hole before she already well seen it? Also her marriage has nothing to do to save earth. It's quite nonsense, I rather have a butterfly effects. What a sad literature, she walks to a heartbroken future with knowing what would happen.

","I can understand nay sayers, but I totally disagree.<br/><br/>Sci Fi is a subjective and a personal thing. A rom com, is well, a film with some romance and some comedy, easy to judge on those requirements. Sci fi just isn't so easy. So those who found the film boring or full of holes, well, sorry, they just don't get what the short story, scriptwriter, director and all those involved wanted to achieve. I can understand that, but for me, Arrival was such a refreshing addition to the Sci Fi genre I was in stunned silence when the film ended in the cinema.<br/><br/>Arrival is a thinking person's Sci fi film. Aliens arrive and for once, and for this it gets credit alone, don't want to destroy us all or steal all our water. <br/><br/>The delivery vehicle for the soul of the film, that ultimate question of would you change your life choices if you knew the future, is simply brilliant. I have watched the film 4 times now, and do you know what? I still don't know what I would do in the lead characters situation. Tell me that isn't an appealing notion? I don't even think there is a correct answer. It's too personal a question. I can imagine changing my answer in 10 years time.<br/><br/>If you dedicate some time to watch the blu ray extras, you can see the efforts they took with bringing the spirit of the short story to the large screen.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is simply perfect in every way. A real character, in a sci fi movie. Impressive. The supporting cast are also excellent. All playing second string to Miss Adams, but you can see are happy to do so. Okay so Ripley was a defining female character in Sci Fi, but ultimately because she was a badass seeking revenge. The Doctor played by Amy Adams could easily have been swapped out for a male lead, this may have even appealed to a wider commercial audience, however, Miss Adams nails it and credit to the Director in his first and only choice.<br/><br/>I could wax lyrical over the cinematography too, but I'll just suggest you watch the trailer. The cloud scene should convince you.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people like Christopher Nolan films, and why not, he's superb. However, though his films tell a good story, do they pose an ethical question that stays with you for ages? Not that I can recall.<br/><br/>With the recent failure of the Alien prequels. It shows that creating a universe whilst telling a good story is really difficult.<br/><br/>I love a good shoot 'em up Sci Fi movie, don't get me wrong but Arrival raises the bar again after many blockbuster sci fi movies have been happy to sail underneath it for bigger and louder explosions.<br/><br/>You don't need to be a sci fi buff to appreciate this movie. For the love of God, just please don't expect a spaceship shootout."

","This is a well-made and well-acted science fiction movie. There is much to admire, such as a thoughtful plot, a careful construction and fine visual and special effects : the aliens, for instance, are genuinely alien, as is the environment they live in. There is also an intelligent and competent heroine, although one can question the wisdom of some of her choices.<br/><br/>Still, ""Arrival"" tends to sidestep or neglect the moral and ethical questions it raises itself. The aliens bring a gift to humanity - but what if this gift turns out to be a curse of Biblical proportions ? What if the aliens have unleashed a terrible blight ? I, for one, would not be pleased to be on the receiving end ; moreover, I can't even begin to grasp the scale of the mayhem released on humanity if the gift became general. It's entirely possible that homo sapiens might disappear from the face of the planet in a few generations, crushed by a weight it was never meant to bear. Or else, for instance, we might find ourselves in a world in which the stupid, the callous and the evil reach a ripe old age, while the clever, the sensitive and the good commit suicide before adulthood.<br/><br/>Ironically, there is much to be said for the argument that it would have been wise to blast the aliens to kingdom come, as soon as their ships became visible."

It certainly shines in terms of its elements of Science Fiction, the special effects, sound design and cinematography are breathtaking, truly deserving of its Academy Award nominations and win in those categories. These elements come together to create truly engrossing spectacles of cinema. <br/><br/>However, it failed to really engage me in to its story, trying to combine so many Sci-Fi elements while also remain grounded in reality. I never became certain of what this film was trying it be or what it wanted me to feel. <br/><br/>The character development is also poor. While Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner certainly deliver top notch performances, because of the muted vibe this movie was going for, I was never given a reason to care about them, to want them to succeed or get together. We learn very little about them, trying to intrigue its audience, I merely become uninvolved with them and stopped caring about the story all together. <br/><br/>Tries to shock, but instead tires.

","Such a hard film to review, just browsing the other reviews you'll get a sense that people either love this film rating it 10, or hate it rating it 1.<br/><br/>I watched the film with no idea of the context, background, or previous reviews. I was looking for a good Sci Fi film and this one popped up.<br/><br/>I think it fair to say that if you're looking for a Star Trek, Starship Troopers, Aliens or other classic Sci Fi film then you'll be disappointed. There is virtually no action in the film, predicated as it is on one persons attempt to communicate with a new alien race. The film could equally have been based on a linguist communicating with ghosts or people beyond the grave, it wouldn't have made a great deal of difference.<br/><br/>Many of the other reviews talk of large plot holes, ridiculous circumstances, or complete absurdity and it's hard to argue with that.<br/><br/>And yet. And yet in it's way, despite everything, it's a beautiful thought provoking film in the way it deals with time, life, death, emotions, human response and so much more. The film is nearly two hours long, and the pace is slow, but I wasn't bored. I didn't feel that it was dragging, and I wasn't tempted even for a second to give up or fast forward.<br/><br/>In summary, if you're looking for a Sci Fi film then probably avoid. If you're looking for two hours of pure emotion and self inspection then without question watch this."
"Ben-Hibburd","10","0","4","10 September 2017"," Arrival Review.
","What do you get with a director at the top of his game, mixed with the endless possibilities afforded to the Sci-Fi genre? The answer is Arrival. Arrival is a powerful film about the fluidity of time, and the power of language. The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve, who at the moment can do no wrong. As with all Villeneuve it goes without saying that the cinematography looks incredible. Where the film truly shines is in it's brilliant, wholly original screenplay.<br/><br/>Amy Adams plays Louise Banks, a linguistics professor. We learn at the start of the film she is a grieving mother going through the motions, that is until 12 oval ships land across the world. Louise is tasked alongside mathematician Ian Donnelly(Jeremy Renner) to try and communicate with the visitors. Every actor is on top of their game here, especially Amy Adams, who becomes increasingly weary and desperate to communicate with the aliens, as tensions rise between global superpowers, over how to handle the situation.<br/><br/>There is not one aspect of this film i can fault, it's one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made. It is full of wonderful ideas, and it explores them in great detail. Just like the best Sci-Fi story's it's also a human story, that is both emotional and powerful. Arrival delivers it's message without it ever feeling condescending, and it's a film that raises the bar in the the Sci-Fi genre."

"thesteelemeister","9","0","4","9 September 2017"," A- An Alien encounter film that branches out from the standard paradigm
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to finish. It was refreshing to see Arrival take an alternative approach this film and focus the plot on translating and interpreting the aliens rather than the typical tropes of fighting or cohabiting with the aliens.<br/><br/>There's nothing worse than watching Science Fiction which fails to be scientifically feasible or accurate. While Arrival leaves a lot of the science to speculation, the link between the language and time linearity is both original and believable.<br/><br/>The acting from the cast in this film is excellent, especially from Amy Adams who does an amazing job of playing Louise.<br/><br/>My only qualm with Arrival would be the ending. Louise called General Shang and managed to get him to call off his attack on the aliens, resulting in everyone else ceasing attack. Louise manages this by knowing about the death of General Shang's wife, something she would not otherwise know without the help of the aliens. I personally feel that the lack of persuasion required by one American woman calling up the Chinese president on his confidential number was not believable and I expected more scepticism from Shang."

"sddavis63","7","0","4","3 September 2017"," It's Tough To Stick With, But A Powerful Ending Makes The Effort Worthwhile
","Perhaps it's strange to review a movie starting with the end, but somehow with ""Arrival"" this makes sense. Everything, to me, led up to the question that Louise (Amy Adams) asked Ian (Jeremy Renner) as the movie approached its close - basically, ""if you could see your whole life laid out before you, would you change anything?"" That's a thought provoking question - and put in the context of this movie, it's a powerful question. <br/><br/>As the movie started, we seemed to be offered a series of flashbacks of Louise's life. She was a mother, her baby grew into a young girl. Louise was a good mother, she adored her daughter, but something happened and her husband left her and her daughter got sick and died. What a downer of a way to start a movie. And how did it possibly relate to a story about aliens? Clearly this was not going to be a typical action-packed alien invasion/sci fi movie. But that opening was was what kept me watching. It was clear that the daughter's death had to be central to whatever was going to happen. But how? Louise was a Linguistics professor. One day, apparently after her daughter's death, 12 alien ships (""shells"") appeared in various parts of the world. Louise - the linguist - is brought in by the US government to try to figure out a way of communicating with the aliens, to figure out why they're here and where they're from. And she's teamed with Ian - a scientist. And really, until the last 10 minutes of the movie, that's about it. The movie seems to be about trying to communicate with the aliens (and to some extent about the various nations trying to communicate with each other.) I took some Linguistics classes when I was in university. I enjoyed them, but I never would have thought that linguistics would make the basis of a good or entertaining movie - and I was right. To be honest, watching Louise try to talk to the ""heptapods"" (because the aliens had seven limbs) was tedious and at times excruciating. Why are the aliens here? That was the question for all of the characters in the movie. Why am I watching this movie? That was the question for me through most of it. But the opening scenes with the daughter kept me watching. I had to figure out how those fit in with the story. And - I'll be honest - I still don't entirely understand it. <br/><br/>Somehow the aliens' way of communicating has something to do with time. The aliens don't have a linear view of time. It isn't from the past into the future. It's everything together, all at once. And somehow this has impacted Louise. Her daughter didn't die in the past - her daughter will die in the future. And as it all comes to an end - after Louise has saved the day by convincing the Chinese (who were about to attack the shell that had landed on their territory) to back down (which maybe turned Louise into a bit too much of a hero; I think the point could have been made in a different way) she poses that question to Ian: ""if you could see your whole life laid out before you, would you change anything?""<br/><br/>Ian's the father! Or, he's going to be the father! He asks her, ""do you want to make a baby?"" And suddenly the question is for Louise to answer: ""if you could see your whole life laid out before you, would you change anything?"" She knows that if she makes this baby with Ian, this baby is going to die as a teenager. Would you change that? Would you not have the baby? Would you not marry Ian? Because the marriage is going to fail. There are things in all our lives that we probably think on the surface we would change if we could. But that question made me think - if I changed the things that weren't so good, that would change all the things that are really great! Everything would be different, because everything is connected to everything else - like the aliens who made clear to Louise that they were just one out of twelve alien ships, all connected. Louise would marry Ian and have the baby. And, having thought about it, I don't think I'd change any of those things in my life that aren't great - because even the not great stuff is connected to the great stuff, and if I didn't have the not great stuff, I probably wouldn't have the great stuff either. If that makes any sense. Very rarely does a movie make you do something as deep as contemplating the very nature of your life. This one did.<br/><br/>Believe me, that last 10 minutes is worth it just for that one question that it raised, and for the explanation of the movie's somewhat strange timeline. It's kind of a tough slog to get get there. It's tedious at times; it's confusing at times. There are things that are simply unbelievable. The aliens seem to have an incredibly complex way of communicating, and Louise really didn't seem to have that much time with them, so her deciphering of their language in that short time was hard to accept. But those opening scenes do keep you watching, and the closing that ties it together makes the whole exercise of watching it worth it. (7/10)"

","What Arrived weren't aliens, what Arrived, was the future. Arrival tackles an issue never really fully explored before, and dissects it to point where it reveals a different dimension in a form that dares to push the limits of what we've seen time and time again.<br/><br/>It was obvious early on in the movie that the alien life wasn't here to harm, but the journey taken to explore that probability was well thought out and entertaining to watch. Communication is a powerful tool, and that is what Arrival was about, communication and understanding.<br/><br/>What ""kangarooed"" me however, were the explosives. The team that goes up there every 22 hours, knew what they just did, yet they still allowed for Louise and Ian to go back up knowing fully well that the 5 minutes they require, will literally go up in smoke. After it did, neither Louise or Ian cared to confront what had just happened, and Colonel Weber didn't seem to be bothered of their safety either, when they were trying to gather more information on what was a very vague response. That entire part of Arrival, jerked the film substantially for me.<br/><br/>Apart from that, Arrival was engaging, and its twist of using the future from beginning to end, as a past trying to explain time without either, and as a memory to stop it from not happening was interesting, though, Dr. Banks' ""choice"" is an aspect of discussion that opens up another can of worms. The little girl being called Hannah too, was a nice touch, it was a fine metaphor.<br/><br/>Thought went into this movie, and it was a pretty big idea that remained grounded, which is also great, while also, being gripping.

","I just saw the movie ""Arrival"" with Amy Adams (2016). This is movie making at it's best. Twelve UFOs land across the globe and since they are not shooting at us we humans are trying to figure out how to say ""Hello"" and hopefully ""Whey are they here?"". Meanwhile China is not too happy with them and getting a few other countries to agree. Louise (Amy Adams) a world renowned linguist is trying to communicate with them per the one that landed in Montana before the shooting starts. This is tension combined with amazing acting, sound editing, music scoring, cinematography and directing from some of our best.<br/><br/>Many reviews were about it getting slow in the middle. I agree as we paying money to see it like to keep the plot moving along. But it was about the frustration of talking to aliens when they arrive which was important to the setup. That was the key to making the third act so intense. Now we are talking humanity, how we on earth will respond globally and reflect upon our responses should an event like this ever actually occur. It is a something to think about movie. They did it very well without promoting a Political agenda as so many Hollywood movies do.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. But I've always loved Forrest Whitaker who probably has the most wide actor range in Hollywood maybe thanks to his agent and never being stereotyped given all his movies. I always feel that I'm getting my money's worth when he is on the screen. As for Amy Adams it is a love affair ever since she won my heart in ""Enchanted"" (2007) and smile when I see her in ""Charlie Wilson's War"" (2007). With ""Arrival"" beauty was not part of the script. Her costumes are low key more for exercising, her hair doesn't seem washed and bundled up to keep it out of the way. But that was the brilliance of the production to connect the audience with the emotions that she as an actress were subtle but also intensive. No one will remember much about the UFO in this movie. They will remember Amy's face. I hope she keeps entertaining us and totally stay out of Politics as so many other stars make that mistake.<br/><br/>""Arrival"" is not an action-adventure Star Wars, the latest Star Trek reboot or anything like it. Thus many who went to the theater looking for pew-pew were no doubt disappointed. As Paramount wanted to make money I did check the trailers and they actually promoted the important scenes accurately (which is rare for Hollywood). Still if one was looking for a much improved version of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) with flashing lights they didn't get it. That movie while very entertaining on the first viewing years later is also hard to watch anymore as it is about Roy (Richard Dryfus) spending too much time in the movie building a mud sculpture in his living room. You decide."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Latest film from the director of Sicario. Thus I had hopeful expectations. The story started off with some strong, minimal and arresting imagery as once again aliens visit Earth and park themselves across the globe and sit their silently awaiting human contact. The protagonist is a linguistics expert and is tasked with attempting to communicate with the aliens to learn their intentions. Nations across the world attempt their own approaches for communication. Will all nations take a calm and peaceful approach or will some use fear as a means to attack and will humans be able to work together? What do the aliens want and are they peaceful? These are the core questions. While the film built up a great and compelling opening it began to falter for me as the process of finding these answers became repetitive and of minimal intrigue. The linguistics partner is a physicist yet never uses his knowledge to advance the story and becomes an underdeveloped sidekick. There are many vague and open-ended aspects to the film which can be fun to ponder but there wasn't enough meat or depth to mentally chew on to keep my brain processing potential possibilities. For me the film fizzled out and didn't amaze me."

"msbreviews","10","0","5","6 August 2017"," Rating: A+
","Brilliant. Is what I have to say after watching this movie twice. Nearly perfect, it has some really minor issues, but it is so freaking brilliant.<br/><br/>Arrival is not a typical alien-invasion movie. If you're going with expectations of watching a human vs alien battle, forget it. This is a beautiful-looking suspenseful drama. Every single shot is filmed with such pitch-perfect pure beauty, Denis Villeneuve has been one of my favorites directors for the past years (Sicario, Prisoners, Enemy ... all movies from previous top10 lists of mine) and the cinematography in this one is just amazing. The first time the audience sees the spaceship up-close is a jaw-dropping long take, showing all of the surrounding space ... Gorgeous.<br/><br/>The soundtrack also kept me so invested in the scenes, I love the tracks of when they're ""face-to-face"" with the aliens. Amy Adams has definitely an Oscar-worthy performance, she's so subtle and simple, but I believed her so much. It's one of those castings where I can't see anyone else portraying her role, she's magnificent. Jeremy Renner is good, but he's not in the movie that much. He serves more as a device for us to understand better the third act revelation and not much more than that. Opposing to Amy's role, Renner is in this movie just because of his popularity. Even his character says that he's useless at some point in the film...<br/><br/>Now, I knew that there was going to be a twist of some sort in the third act, but it didn't make a difference ... It's really awesome. It makes me rethink the whole film and that's the main reason why I needed to watch this movie a second time before reviewing it. The truth is that it's perfectly directed, there's isn't a single flaw relatively to its story and the final revelation it's so incredible that it is going to make you leave the theater extremely satisfied. I can't tell you much more than this without spoiling something.<br/><br/>I can't really find important issues with this movie. I mean, Jeremy Renner's character is kind of put aside pretty strangely and the whole suspense around the ""what is their purpose?"" is diluted maybe too fast, but that's not something I felt negatively affected by. The pacing might seem too slow, but if you know Villeneuve's work like I do and if you enjoy filmmaking quality like Arrival has, then everything is going to speed up a little. I actually think that the pacing improved during my second session. It's deliberately slow in order to give you time to think everything as you should, so I find this as a positive instead of a negative.<br/><br/>Arrival is probably on my top5 list of alien-invasion of all-time. It's super intriguing, its story is fascinating, Amy Adams is so captivating with one of her best performances ever, Denis Villeneuve's direction proves to be perfect once again (one of my favorite directors of today, if not the favorite), the soundtrack is rememberable and the movie looks stunningly gorgeous, with beautiful cinematography. A deliberately slow pacing might bring the movie down for some people, but for me, it's right on point. A sci-fi masterpiece.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"

This spoiled what was an otherwise enjoyable film.<br/><br/>This is very much a thinking mans/woman's science fiction movie; I only wish I had switched off and not figured out the ending to what is a very different kind of sci-fi flick from star wars or star trek."
"kmnphotograph","7","0","3","13 July 2017"," Thought provoking movie
","To begin, I definitely think that people with children will find this movie a bit more interesting than singles or couples with no kids. To sum up the movie, it basically asks the question, ""What if""<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!!!<br/><br/>The movie essentially asks the question, if you knew the future, what would you do? In this case, it was regarding the main characters decision to let her child exist. Even knowing that her child would eventually die the death she has, she still made the decision to let her be conceived/born. Her husband clearly opposes that and thus the reason she is alone and on her own as he has left because he is angry at her decision.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, the whole concept of this movie will have a more emotional impact on people with kids as it creates a discussion about what you would do as parents if you had that ability to know ahead of time what life your child would live? If you knew they would die young, would you still have the child? Or would you not have one knowing they were going to die and put you through that heartbreak? It definitely raises interesting questions about one's ideals.<br/><br/>I definitely think the movie is slow paced at times, but overall, I liked it a lot only for the thought provoking questions it makes us think about afterwards. As a parent of kids the same age as the one in the movie, I find that I would do exactly what she did."

The same kind of people who always complain about their food at a restaurant. If you're a new age Sci Fi fan and liked movies such as interstellar, Gravity and Prometheus then I think you'll like this. It's one of those sci fi movies that inspires teenagers to become astronauts (maybe a linguist in this case). It is somewhat emotional, which can lead to feelings where people either hate the movie or love it, hence the polarised reviews. This is the sort of film you'd wished you saw in cinema due to the great visuals (10/10 for me) with a good soundtrack that I first heard in 'shutter island' and 'disconnected'. It would've been interesting if the writers attempted to explain how they deciphered the alien language rather than avoiding explaining it with a voice over by Jeremy renner, but the premise was interesting enough. Not higher than an 8 for me as I loved it at the time but it hasn't stayed with me like a 10/10 movie would. Maybe it's because I can't relate to the main character that much (different sex)."
"thinkerpadder","7","0","3","22 May 2017"," Not what I expected
","I watched this movie when I saw an 8 out of 10 score. The build up of the story and the complexity of the plot were somewhat intellectually stimulating. Unfortunately, with that depth comes the classic naivety of Hollywood movies : US looking for peace, other nations are some whining 6-year-old kids looking for violence by any means necessary. Some reviews actually claim that the movie is good because it speaks about humanity !!! What humanity ? All what has been presented about Russians, Chinese, Sudan was through a screen in some US military base. That's ""humanity"" ?<br/><br/>Yet, the movie left me with some great questions : how on earth would a theoretical physics expert become so fascinated by languages and some weird circular calligraphy, when he sees with his own bare f***ing eyes a floating object, defying all what he learned his entire life ?<br/><br/>Personally, my first question to aliens would be : how.... HOW DO YOU THAT ?... Imagine the possibilities if such thing existed.... That's what I call intriguing stuff, not some weird souvenir of a Chinese General's wife."
"chnutscher","8","0","3","18 May 2017"," Great movie, spoilers are helpful before the first view
","Great movie, spoilers are helpful before the first view.<br/><br/>Sci-Fi aficionados probably can't withstand to like it. So did I. The narrative line is cleverly constructed, however, if you watch it the first time probably you just don't get the point if you don't know that the flashbacks in ""reality"" are glimpses of the future. Like another reviewer wrote, you probably will appreciate it more on a second view, once you've understood the setup.<br/><br/>Very poetic for everyone who is receptive for the Sci-Fi mystery, able to induce imaginative thoughts. Settings, CGI and sound were very good. The point maybe one does consider after the first enthusiasm is that some parts in fact do not make too much sense, seen objectively (in fiction terms). For example, the stretch until it is understood that a communication works with writing and not with speech, logic would tell viceversa is the best attempt. Also the storyline that humans try hard to be able to communicate in the alien script, meh, given the supposed superiority of that alien race you would expect it's them who should not have too much problems to communicate in an earth writing. But never mind, Sci-Fi remains Sci-Fi, it doesn't take you much to concede these script liberties, when the production as whole is that appealing.<br/><br/>I'm prejudiced with Amy Adams, as I find her a very likable presence anyway, but I think she did a good acting job here, the delivery of the doctor/professor was quite convincing."
"bowmanblue","7","0","5","2 May 2017"," A thinking man's 'Independence Day'
","Oh, no – giant alien spaceships arrive on Earth and hover over every major city with disastrous (and most likely CGI-heavy) consequences! Yes, we've seen this tired and strained plot for many decades (albeit the slightly older films relied on strings holding up the UFOs, but that was still pretty 'high0-bidget' at the time!). However, in this case, the aliens actually don't go straight into nuking every recognisable landmark they can find on Google Maps. Instead, they actually try to have a chat. However, just because they've left the White House in one piece, doesn't mean things go smoothly. Basically, they have a completely different language to us, therefore the American military enlist the help of a reclusive language specialist (Amy Adams) to help translate.<br/><br/>Naturally, there's the obligatory 'love interest' for Adams. This comes in the form of Jeremy Renner, who is likable for what he's there for. Forest Whittaker is always good at pretty much whatever he does, so he's not out of place as the army general in charge of the operation.<br/><br/>I knew this basic premise of before I sat down to watch the film and did wonder whether it was possible to string the entire film out for around two hours on this. And, I'm pleased to say that it actually worked. You see the alien ships land in various countries around the world and, although we obviously only really focus on America's involvement with them, we get to hear about how other countries handle them. 'Arrival' is one of those films where, in some ways, it's very difficult to review. If I give away too much it may spoil certain elements of the film. If the basic premise interests you (and you're not expecting wild aerial dogfights against waves of invading flying saucers) then you should definitely give it a go. The film is basically a mystery. You know the aliens are here for a reason, but you have to learn what it is at the same pace as the film's characters. And, if you don't mind the wait, you should enjoy the slow burn.<br/><br/>I definitely enjoyed it, but, as I know the ending now, it does mean that it's never going to be as mysterious the second time around. I'd certainly go for a re-watch one day, but you'll only ever get to see it for the first time once and be totally in the dark as to what the ending will entail. Sorry I'm being a bit vague, but, if it interests you, the less you know the better. Either way, at least it proves that you don't need epic space battles or global destruction to make a movie interesting. And this one even raises a few questions in terms of what one person perceives as 'language' may be totally different from another."
"vinodemails","8","0","5","24 April 2017"," Arrives in time
","The movie is based on an adaptation of a short story by Ted Chiang called the 'The Story of your life'. This sentence itself should raise curiosity as you'd wonder how the story of one's life can be related to a sci-fi movie about Aliens arriving on earth. This and recommendations from my friends drew my attention to this 2016 released film starring Amy Adams and Jeremy 'renner', yup the quotes are there for a reason.<br/><br/>With the opening scene of a huge french window overlooking a lake with lights being all murky, it feels like a Sunday morning on a rainy day when you woke up too early. These light effects continue throughout​ the running time, and together with the intermittent flashbacks/forwards of Louise (Amy) make you dizzy. However, don't get me wrong, the film manages to arise enough curiosity, and makes up for it's lack of grandiose, pace and action with scenes full of feel, emotion and awe.<br/><br/>The premise is a regular one, alien ships arrive on earth (12 of them), spread across the world and as usual, we get to stick to the one which landed in US of A. Many films have started thus, only to make it an expedition of Earth's annihilation or of some adventure of a miscreant individual alien. This one, however manages to keep it slow, allowing the humans to speculate, explore and attempt to communicate with the aliens, who strangely seem to be not in any hurry. So, humanity's less known linguists come to the fore to help decipher the answer to 'whats your purpose of visiting earth?'. And of course, scientists and military to assist them.<br/><br/>Ian, the scientist (played by Jeremy) acts as the side kick to Louise, who comes up with innovative ideas on communication while dealing with her inner turmoil of a dear personal loss. There are few fun moments with the CIA agent and the aliens, but generally a sobre feeling prevails. While keeping the dialogue and even the bgm minimalistic, director focuses on getting the feel of each scene just right. <br/><br/>Without much spoilers, i can reveal that the plot revolves around varied topics, highlighting human's basic nature of self protection, lack of unity, self doubt and paucity of trust; while applauding the ability to work together when required and resolve problems with an analytical approach. However, the focus is on that abstract variable which we define as 'time'. <br/><br/>The movie is a must watch for those sci-fi loving folk, who are by now tired of all the typical Hollywood blockbusters and are interested in more realistic fiction focusing as much on the story as it does on it's visuals. For others, I'd still recommend 'Independence day'."
"Laimbrane","9","0","5","19 April 2017"," Amazing science fiction that trades science for emotion
","Arrival is a methodical, lyrical, and personal science-fiction film about one woman's experience with an alien arrival. Like all great sci-fi, the film is intellectually challenging and potentially perspective-altering, and I was actually shocked by how hard the ending hit me. Unlike most other emotionally powerful films, my reaction was less about an attachment to the growth and arcs of its characters and more about the deep resonance of the film's ideas and central theme.<br/><br/>Arrival has been compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey, and to a point that holds as both films are about humankind being changed by extra- terrestrial encounters. However, artistically they couldn't be much farther apart. 2001 was technically and scientifically exacting in its attempt to tell its cold and impersonal story, while Arrival simplifies things and skimps on the details of the science in order to better service the humanity of the tale. While 2001 is without a doubt a masterpiece, Arrival may have actually meant MORE to me, even through its flaws, because Arrival - as good as it is - isn't perfect. The characters are somewhat one-note and viewers that have seen Close Encounters of the First Kind may be turned off by some of the curious choices various entities in this film make.<br/><br/>The story goes like this - Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a foreign languages expert sleepwalking through her daily life due to grief over the death of her daughter to a rare disease. At the start of the film, 12 alien ships arrive, hovering silently in apparently random places around the globe. Louise is recruited by the Colonel Weber (Forrest Whittaker) for the U.S. military to help translate the alien language in order to find out their purpose for coming to Earth. She's assigned to head a team being run by Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) that is set up at the base of the ship hovering within U.S. borders.<br/><br/>She arrives, meets the aliens, and starts to attempt to understand a creature that is wholly different from humans. Here is where Arrival starts to stand out from many other films about first contact, in that it treats the aliens as aliens. They think differently, so they are going to try to communicate differently. The rest of the movie is about how Banks learns to communicate with the aliens on the clock set by Russia and China, who get suspicious about the aliens' motives and make questionable decisions and unnecessary leaps of logic that serve the story in a McGuffinesque way.<br/><br/>Of course, the Chinese aren't the only ones that make curious decisions and questionable leaps of logic. I'm pretty sure the U.S. government already has a team of linguistic, biology, psychology, and astronomy experts ready to go in the event of an arrival like this, so the fate of the world doesn't rest on one egghead. Their study of the language happens on occasion with those movie leaps of logic where the realizes what the answer to some question has to be even though there are probably three or four other very plausible explanations. Banks is a bit of a Mary Sue character in this regard - she's the hero that is fighting against everyone else but is never actually wrong, and has no real flaws other than the trauma that turns out to be important to the story.<br/><br/>Artistically, the Arrival is mesmerizing. The score and cinematography are dreamy and disarming, and the the actors slow down to allow the film to breathe. It's actually rather amazing that both this and the far more intense film Serpico were made by the same director, and demonstrates that Villeneuve has an absolute mastery of his craft. There is nothing showy at all, no moments of true beautiful visual awe as in Close Encounters or 2001 and no signature camera angles or movements. Other than Banks, none of the the characters are not particularly fleshed out, and none of the actors has any Oscar-worthy moments of bombast. The only thing important here is the story, and Villeneuve subdues everything else to allow the ideas behind this to take center stage. It takes its time sink its teeth in us and force us to follow us to where it's leading, pacing itself and its discoveries in a way that can occasionally feel frustrating but are worth it in the end. <br/><br/>And oh, boy, is it ever worth it. The opinion of this movie that the viewer walks away with will largely depend on two things: how they handle the subtly flippant attitude toward actual science, and how they respond emotionally to the final act. Arrival gets at a couple pretty deep questions that I don't recall having seen in a film before - and certainly not in this way - but accepting the power of this movie requires buy-in. I sat in my seat crying - literally crying - over one of Louise's lines of voice-over near the end of the movie, and I can't imagine that line having as much power without any of the hard work - and, yes, questionable plot decisions - being a part of this film up until that point. <br/><br/>Would every viewer watch this movie if they knew what was going to happen in it? Maybe, maybe not. Arrival is a movie that may not be for everyone, but like all great science-fiction, it may just make you rethink how you experience the world around you."

However, there's nothing in this film that blew me away, nothing spectacular and as far as I'm concerned, nothing to justify the many glowing reviews it has received.<br/><br/>Sci-Fi is a tricky genre to master and 'Arrival' certainly gave it a good shot. It's interesting enough, but don't believe all the hype because 'Arrival' is far from being a masterpiece."

","This was advertised as the ""best sci-fi movie of the year"". We have maybe, half of the best sci-fi movie of the year.<br/><br/>Arrival promised from the trailer an amazing alien landing film, with the leads of Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams watching them. We expect from this, action, horror, violence and world domination. We got something much different. It was a chance well taken, pulling alien sci-fi out of the tropes it has been left to rot in. There were a lot of different routes it could have taken and this one was well chosen, Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners – 2013; Sicario – 2015) definitely made the right choice. <br/><br/>However, my issues with this film, lie within the cinematography. The shaky camera frames, the silent soundtrack, the hearing everything as Louise heard it as things were happening were all extremely disorientating. The film could have been made a lot better without these things, and with less experimental techniques to make the film unique – the plot alone was unique enough. The plot of this film, as before said, was amazing. Humans teaching aliens their language, and vice versa. It was highly unique, and showed great techniques.<br/><br/>The unfortunate thing about this film was that it didn't kick off until an hour and ten minutes into the film. It was a total let down and a shame. However, it was a heavy trudge through to get to the action in the film.<br/><br/>It was a shame, truly, that this film was advertised so big and for it to be such a let down in the first half, and it's only being rated a six out of ten."

With a phenomenal performance by Amy Adams the movie takes you through an engaging story about love, sacrifice and time itself. The Sci-Fi part of the film is only a small part of an even greater theme. The soundtrack by Johann Johannsson is also very well composed, including the violin piece by Max Ritcher, on the nature of daylight.

"doxxman5","10","0","5","22 March 2017"," as metaphysical and analytical as the mysteries of the universe
","Arrival is a very odd name for this movie, since so much of the movie does not focus on the ""arrival"" of the aliens, yet communicating with them. Perhaps what it refers to is the arrival of truth at the film's end. The aliens in the picture constantly try to communicate with the humans, and we live this process via Amy Adams's language expert. We don't really try and talk to them on our own, as everything is a response to an actions the aliens perform (almost as if they had this planned out?). This is how a director of the movie, Denis Villeneuve, communicates his language to the audience and this journey is an arrival of a movie that is aware of cinema's past and its future.<br/><br/>Everything in Arrival is fluid and expertly done, from the brilliant camera work to the pulsating score to the merging of several timelines which effortlessly tell a story. In a lot of ways, Arrival is the perfection and culmination of the extra-terrestrial sci fi movies of the 21st century so far: from District 9 to Prometheus to Interstellar, we have somehow gotten here and it makes us stop and reanalyze it all. There is little action in the movie, an explosion is shoehorned in during a subplot in the middle and there is media coverage footage showing how different countries react to what they assume is a threat. But it all connects to the current events of the times, as our inability to communicate with China or Russia may lead to disaster because people get scared when they do not understand something as simple as language and perceive anything or anyone different then themselves as a threat or an alien.<br/><br/>Arrival presents us with many ideas, the most powerful being what is the connection between time and language? The alien's language in Arrival, revealed as a symbol of circular fluid, is a metaphor for the circle of the plot of the film itself. There are so many mediocre alien invasion movies over the last fifty years of movie making that Arrival is like a masterclass in how to do it right: accessible to the mainstream movie going public and as metaphysical and analytical as the mysteries of the universe. There are many unanswered questions that thrill the mind rather than frustrate and so many places where the movie could have faltered but it never does. This may be Amy Adams best cinematic performance yet but acting itself is almost made irrelevant throughout the course of the movie that it is easy to overlook; this movie immerses the viewer in an alien spaceship and makes one reexamine their entire existence. Arrival simply does the best job of communicating and illustrating its point then any other movie of the year."

Just time is important in this movie, and if you are looking for lots of action, this is not the movie for you. The film is careful and slow. Amy Adams is good as it somewhat strange and pensive language expert, who must cope with a major challenge. The film's strength is in my opinion a new twist in this genre. The weakness is that it sometimes becomes somewhat tedious. We would like something to happen. There is also a minus that in this film also pulled into the military engaging in an boring manner. The film has a strong and surprise ending. But overall this is a good sci-fi drama, and well worth seeing."

The pacing is intentionally slow, which I believe serves to put the viewer in the same anxious state the characters are living in.<br/><br/>The process of decryption and communication is handled believably - it seems a number of 1-star reviewers don't understand basic tenets of linguistics (not that I can blame them). Using building blocks to establish understanding is crucial, and takes time - time that the viewer feels in a very real way.<br/><br/>The film's conclusion is poignant, satisfying, and well set up without being obvious. I feel sorry for those reviewers who said they left early - they missed a stunning conclusion to a wonderfully told story.

","A lot of shows and movies make characters unusually stupid or mean to create a dynamic between characters. This one uses the not talking method whereby people are desperate for someone to speak and then they just don't. The scene could easily be drama free if people communicated like normal human beings. I think Amy Adams stares into the distance blankly for about half an hour total while people madly scramble about in the background. It's such a lazy way to make a moment intense or a character look deep. The coolest stuff - communicating with the aliens, they repeatedly cut the scenes short. And of course people take up arms against the completely non-violent aliens because of the weird way they communicate gets people confused as to their intentions. If someone you don't know comes up to you and says 'weapon' you don't immediately pull out a shotgun and blow their head off. You say 'what are you talking about?'

It can be different based (environment) and it looks and sounds, communicate very different. The challenge. That's what the movie is about. <br/><br/>It's a story with 2 tracks. The one: Arrival how can we communicate? The other is jumping (mentally) back and forth in time. (her gift) What did the Chinese general say to her? Just the phone call he heard and she repeated it back in time. Like she ""remembered"" what to say.<br/><br/>A clever movie I must say. On a higher scale than Independence day for instance.

","So many people are totally missing the point. Guys, this movie is not about language, its about time and how we perceive it.<br/><br/>Imagine a being living in a fifth dimension where all of ""time"" is laid out in front of them. It is very hard for us humans to grasp this concept, and we will never do because our brains and bodies are made for a 4 dimensional space/time. In the same way we are superior to 2 or 3 dimensional beings (if they exist), yet we cannot actually make them truly understand our 4D world.<br/><br/>This is what the aliens are doing, trying to make us understand that time is a construct. Their language evolved in a way that does not include past, present and future because to them its all the same (presumably, there is no way of knowing for sure). This is backed up by science.<br/><br/>I really do not understand how a movie like Interstellar can get a lot of praise for totally defecating on science (sending a human into a black hole and them living to tell about it, yeah right!) while this one is totally misunderstood.

","My review actually discusses a HUGE spoiler, so please do not read if you haven't seen the movie!<br/><br/>One of the reasons I don't like that IMDb took away the message boards is that I can't discuss this movie, which I loved. In my mind, Louise now has a chance to save her marriage, and not hurt the relationship between her daughter and the daughter's father, because now she knows Ian's reaction. So, in this new future, Louise can keep the secret of Hanna's death, and let it all play out with Ian beside her, and with Hannah. It's bittersweet, but a good concept. By becoming fluent in the language of the aliens, she sees life and time as they do. Kind of reminds me of the tralfamadorians from Vonnegut's ""Slaughterhouse Five"". But, this is a different story with a similar concept, and it allows our hero (Louise) to actually change the outcome of her life, and make it better. Even though it means keeping a terrible secret from her future husband.<br/><br/>I kept hoping that the technology of the aliens could save her daughter, but I guess that is just not in the cards in the story. I didn't appreciate the little Hollywood digs at Fox news, having a ""Rush Limbaugh"" type screaming on his radio show, and having a crooked mouthed Greta Van Susterin idiot calling for war. But being from Hollywood, of course you're gonna have to take a swat or two at conservatives. Also, the way the Corporal (Forrest Whittaker) dismisses this giant revelation that Louse shares about the gift is totally unbelievable. Just because you are in the military does not mean you are a fool.<br/><br/>Overall, loved this movie!! Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did."
"beeblebrox-2","8","0","5","24 February 2017"," Fantastic but not a 10
","I really loved this film. It has an emotional impact that is rare in SF films these days. Contrast this with the awful ""Passengers"" and you can see how big of swing there is in writing quality in this genre.<br/><br/>Others have written eloquently on the quality of the music, cinematography, acting, story, and direction. I can't add anymore to those accolades.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS FOLLOW ****<br/><br/>But here are a few reasons why it is only an 8 in my book.<br/><br/>1. This is not quite as good as Interstellar or Inception, which are the 10-star gold standard by which I measure other modern SF films).<br/><br/>Why? <br/><br/>a.) The score for Arrival is quite good but it is not of the Hans Zimmer caliber we hear in Interstellar or Inception. b.) The story, while very strong, still has a bit of the clichéd ""Get your act together humans and work together or else"" kind of feel. The Nolan films were completely unique and free of clichéd SF story lines.<br/><br/>2. The flashback editing is, in many places, a cheat. The entire film is actually a flashback starting from just a few minutes in but once in the main flashback time-line there are combinations of flash-forwards and flashback. It's easiest to visualize the time-lines as ""Now"" at the opening and closing of the movie with flashbacks from that time-line being the scenes where Hannah and Louise are having conversations about this and that. Meanwhile, the main story-line of dealing with aliens is actually a flashback at least 25 years in the past from the ""Now"" where the movie begins and ends. In that time-line the narrative is continuously interrupted by flashbacks from the ""Now"" time-line and then eventually we begin to see flash-forwards from the 25 year in the past time-line of the Arrival of the aliens. <br/><br/>Some fans of Arrival categorize all the flashbacks from the ""Now"" time-line as actually being the ""memories of future events"" (flash-forwards from the 25 year in the past time-line) and I tend to think that this is because the director makes very little visual distinction between what is a flash- back and what is a ""future memory"" flash-forward. <br/><br/>We eventually DO see Louise having flash-forward memories late in the film after her brain is ""rewired"" by the alien language. This is purposefully (and I think unnecessarily) confusing for the viewer. The flashbacks of Louise's interactions with Hannah start long before Louise meets the aliens and they are much more obviously flashbacks from the opening ""Now"" time-line. <br/><br/>It is only much later in the film that we begin to realize that the director is inter-cutting FLASH-FORWARDS (e.g. Louise has a premonition of a girl with a caterpillar, poking a stick into a creek, picking up a stone, etc.). In those scenes we sense that Louise is only getting fuzzy glimpses of future events - which are completely different from the crystal clear conversations such as we have seen earlier in the film (discussions of ""win/win"" term definitions, drawings by the young Hannah, why daddy left mommy, etc.). By mixing narrative flashbacks, intended as clues for the viewer (and not something that Louise is actually experiencing as future memories) it muddies the narrative - probably on purpose - to keep the viewer off-balance. Villeneuve could have, for example, made the future memory sequences desaturated and diffuse to make it obvious that they were different from the flashbacks. He chose not to hence, why I think it's a cheat. <br/><br/>3. There was never enough sense that Louise's study of the language was beginning to rewire her brain, as was implied that different languages might. Although we see the fruits of her labor, we never get a sense sense that Louise is living, eating, breathing, and dreaming in the heptapod language prior to starting to see the future (the aforementioned glimpses of the girl with the caterpillar and the stone in the creek). This would have helped us buy that she would eventually start having premonitions about the future.<br/><br/>I completely agree with other fans that the film is a thinking-person's movie and enjoyable for many reasons, not the least of which is because the twist, if you can call it that, is not sudden but a slowly dawning one. <br/><br/>What I think I most enjoyed about the ending is that it is so bitter sweet. The heroine is successful in one way but meets with profound sadness in another. She unites the world but ends up alone in the end.<br/><br/>BONUS CONJECTURE:<br/><br/>Learning a language that allows you to see glimpses of your own future would probably cause a human to go insane. What is now and what is in the future would become intermingled leaving the person who learned the language, a quivering shell of a human being.<br/><br/>The Heptapods know this. It is their weapon for conquering earth. They teach one very smart human who then deploys the weapon in the classroom and in a book (as we see happen at the end of the film). Engaged and intelligent humans learn the alien language and then slowly begin to go insane as they all start seeing their own future. This leaves only dolts and morons who could never learn the language, as the remaining population. Much easier to occupy a planet of idiot sheep than one composed of a certain percentage of thinking individuals who might fight back<br/><br/>Discuss."

","Polarizing. Profound. ‪""Arrival"" is a sardonic satire of humanity and our inability to comprehend the language of symbols and art, or more aptly put, what is unknown...<br/><br/>This world is sadly not yet ready for the almighty ""Arrival,"" though it couldn't come at a more relevant time than right now. It's undoubtedly one of the most meticulously crafted and well-directed films I've seen in my entire life. Not a single frame is gone to waste. I felt callbacks of the world-renowned Kubrick upon watching the genius unfold before me. Everything connects so wonderfully together that I am truly floored at what I just had the pleasure of experiencing. This movie has the potential to completely change the outlook of humanity and all the limitations inherent in our thinking. I can understand people being confused by it, however, as I was a little foggy as well initially (fog is utilized in this film for a reason). After subsequent meditation and analysis of the film's core themes and symbolism, I thought I had a pretty firm grasp on what the movie was trying to say, and I declared it as my number two of 2016. Clearly I was wrong, as watching this movie a second time clearly solidified in my mind that this movie is nothing but pure, unadulterated genius. My head is still spinning from how well the narrative illustrates the message of the film in and of itself: utilizing symbols (a universal language) to communicate ideas and unify humanity in working as a collective whole to make legitimate progress and live up to our species' highest potential. This reflects the need to piece this movie's narrative together and communicate with others about what it's saying in order to attain enlightenment. The film is seemingly too alien and complicated for some to fully comprehend on their own terms.<br/><br/>We follow a professional linguist, named Louise, who is an incredibly intuitive and open-minded thinker, unlike her peers. The ones in charge (gov't, newspeople, etc.) are so cleverly subverted, illustrating how little they actually know in working with the unknown and how to approach foreign life, as a result of being trapped within the confines of their own restrictive bubbles. I feel like this is indicative of not understanding the movie (or any great works of art, really) and dismissing it on impulse, rather than thinking it out thoroughly. Essentially, at its core, this movie is trying to say to live in the moment, work together, and have an open-mind on what is unknown. It's the only way to make genuine progress, as collectivism is key in trying to decipher meaning, both in art and in the real world. If you can't appreciate the sheer brilliance of this movie, then perhaps another viewing is what will do it. I knew the first time it was insanely deep, but not to the extent I do now having seen it again. Do not be bound by time, watch this movie over and over until it fully clicks. It's unquestionably worth it in the long run, as I can feel the influence of this movie glistening within the corridors my soul. It is, without a doubt in mind, a modern day masterpiece. I'm calling it now, this film is destined to go down in the books and will be praised for the remainder of our existence. Watch it and study.<br/><br/>https://letterboxd.com/extremewaffle"

","I hear and see a lot of mixed reviews on this movie so I thought I would put my two cents in.<br/><br/>Let's start off by saying this movie is not for everyone. There are two types of Sci-Fi movies, those that are more strait-forward and conventional (e.g., Star Wars) and those that are a bit more out of the box (e.g., Interstellar, Moon, Inception). Arrival is most definitely the latter. I went in with very little knowledge of the movie, which may have helped, but more importantly this is a movie you have to watch with an open mind. Things will not make sense until the end so it requires a bit of patience on the side of the viewer. That patience, however, is paid off well at the end with one of the most well- thought of and memorable endings I have witnessed. The viewer is required to pay attention to a lot of details and connect the dots, however if you enjoy movies that get the gears in your head going and enjoy a good mental puzzle, you will enjoy this movie. If you like to watch movies and ""shut off your brain"", you are probably better off sticking to movies like Star Wars.<br/><br/>It has been two days since I watched the movie and I am still reflecting on it and on my life as a result, Amazing!"

This wasn't your standard alien movie and there was a lot of depth to it. The cinematography was incredible, I mean absolute eye candy. The score was beautiful and intricate. And Amy Adams performance was truly show stopping. Not to mention the incredible plot twist.

","Here comes a puntapod arriving to your viewing eyes, as I review the sci-fi flick ""Arrival"". Please don't run away, I pun in peace. Acclaimed Director Denis Villeneuve's ""Arrival"" stars the astounding Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks, an expert linguist professor who is called in by the U.S. Government when semi-oval saucers arrive in several locations throughout the globe, including Montana in the U.S. Her duty is to try to decipher communication from the arriving heptapods, not an easy task. They should have just called Trump to deport the illegal alien heptapods, problem solved. Anyyyways, off the politics. Dr. Banks is paired up in this mission with Dr. Ian Donnelly, an expert physicist, played well by Jeremy Renner. This is not your simple alien story, there is a twist thrown in by the brainy humanoid movie director Villeneuve that will throw you for a loop. You can take it to the bank that Adams was robbed of a Best Actress Oscar nomination in her performance as Banks. Eric Heisserer's screenplay of ""Arrival"" was earthly sound, even though it had a tad too much of the scientific jargon; but I guess that comes with the sci-fi territory. If you still have not arrived to the viewing landscape of ""Arrival"", I suggest you do so now. **** Good"

"byStevenRamirez","10","0","5","19 February 2017"," Feeling a Part of Something outside Ourselves
","Boy, did I need to see this! 2016 was a tough year for many reasons, both generally and personally. It's not often I watch a movie twice in a row, but after seeing 'Arrival' the first time the other night, I couldn't wait to put it on again. I've always been a huge Amy Adams fan—two of my favorite movies of hers being 'Enchanted' and 'Julie & Julia.' She's one of those rare actors who can exhibit both vulnerability and strength at the same time and break your heart in the process. And as a professor of linguistics trying to solve an impossible mystery, she is at the top of her game.<br/><br/>I won't recount the story here—you can watch the trailer for that. But I will point out a few things I felt made this film—nominated for eight Academy Awards at the time of this writing—brilliant. First off, the writing. The story by Ted Chiang is filled with a profound sense of human longing—a longing to connect with something bigger. Many people interpret this as a search for God in our lives, and I happen to believe that. But I think, in general, people want to feel a part of something outside ourselves. Something that gives life meaning and us a purpose. The screenplay, based on that story, captures this feeling beautifully and reinforces it throughout so that by the time you ARRIVE at the end, you can SEE.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography were perfect for this kind of storytelling. Everything that happens is seen through Louise's eyes, and we unravel the mystery with her. As if things weren't difficult enough trying to decipher an alien language, she is always surrounded by strangers—army personnel and CIA operatives—whose purpose she can't fathom and who seem to be in opposition to what she's trying to accomplish. Inside the massive floating spacecraft, we lose our sense of direction. And the playing with time itself throughout is hypnotic.<br/><br/>Of course, any good movie has lots of conflict, which in this case is presented in the form of people's paranoia about the aliens. The armies of the world all want to know what the aliens' purpose is in coming here and, judging from their actions, they are all on a hair trigger. The director Denis Villeneuve captures this intense struggle with simplicity and clarity. And to balance things out—because not everyone in the military can be bad—we have the character of Colonel Weber, who is just trying to understand. Oh, and that soundtrack! Pay attention to the horns every time we see the aliens.<br/><br/>In the wrong hands, 'Arrival' could have turned into 'Independence Day.' Thank goodness cooler heads prevailed! No doubt, I will see it again."
"justin-fencsak","9","0","4","19 February 2017"," Probably the best sci-fi movie of the year....
","While the highest grossing sci-fi and overall movie of last year remains Rogue One, the one that's getting a lot of awards and acclaim is Arrival. Directed by a Canadian whose most known work before this was Prisoners with Hugh Jackman and Jake Gylenhall which was a hit in the fall of 2013 and a cult movie. Made on a moderate budget of $47 million, this sci-fi thriller is worth a buy on Blu- Ray with awesome CGI, great casting, and some cool music. Amy Adams shines as the main character while Jeremy Renner is her co-star in a movie that kinda meanders a bit on pacing yet gets interesting towards the end. The Blu-Ray's sound mix is pretty good and very loud; the abundance of special features consisting of featurettes makes up for the lack of a director's commentary, although the lack of a DVD is now common among newer movies that come with a digital HD file which requires payment via Itunes or Ultraviolet. If this movie wins Best Picture, it will mark the first time since Lord of the Rings 3 that a sci-fi fantasy film has won the award. See it once, or even twice!!!"

","Throw away all your preconceptions of alien movies, sci-fi and just absorb this movie when you go see it. The script was inspired, the directing like done by a maestro and the performances by Amy Adams, Jeremy Brenner and Forest Whitaker, flawless.<br/><br/>I've watched just about all the alien movies of significance in over 50 years and this one is unlike any of them. It is simply thought provoking. It does not make special effects the centre of attention, but instead those complement well a journey your mind must take. It brings out the human flaws, also the beauty of the human mind and greatness of having an open one, the fearless desire for understanding beyond. <br/><br/>The writer was not beneath using a tiny bit of humour to break tension and suspense and I like that. What you will get out of this movie may vary from one person to another but what I got out of it was a sense of hope and peace despite the always looming dangers of man's imperfections.<br/><br/>If good movies are suppose to instill strong feelings and make us think, then this one is definitely a good movie."

The director steals from us much of the language learning process.<br/><br/>However, if you can stand the low pace (do not expect action or a fast movie), it's very interesting and enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>You'd have to buy the linguistic theory the movie is based on... If you are a hardcore hard-sci-fi fan, you might find that some aspects the movie sounds more ""magical"" than sci-fi. Not the movie's fault, that's what happens in the original short story.<br/><br/>As for the people that complain about what the aliens are... dammit, cephalopoda are some of the smartest creatures on Earth. It has to be either insects or cephalopoda... because mammals are pretty rare (a weird evolutionary occurrence). So, the aliens were pretty interesting.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it. But it's not crap at all. Some people just didn't like it. It's certainly better than all the Twilight saga, all the Star Wars prequels and Prometheus. That's easy, though. It's pretty good.

","ARRIVAL is a refreshing science fiction story that allows the audience to approach the concept of alien visits as something of value rather than the beginning of the end. No comic book antics in this sensitive film based on Ted Chiang's story 'Story of Your Life' and adapted with great skill by screenplay author Eric Heisserer. This is a film that asks us to ask questions about our place in the universe and in the cycle of life using the visitation of extraterrestrials as the stimulus. Denis Villeneuve directs with consummate skill.<br/><br/>The dialogue of the film has many rare insights – words that come form the characters such as 'Language is the foundation of civilization. It is the glue that holds a people together. It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict' and 'But now I'm not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrived.'<br/><br/>The story line as action is simple – a factor that enhances the importance of the message of the film. Twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world. Linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors with the assistance of theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They join the Army team led by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) in Montana – one of the twelve areas where the craft have landed. Banks job is to try to learn the aliens' language and enable communication with them. Through regular meetings with two of the aliens she starts to compile a record of the aliens' ""language"" - a series of drawn symbols. The important question is - are they friend or foe? Other nations with alien landings are starting to view them as a threat, making it a race against time as war with the aliens could erupt at any moment.<br/><br/>With extraordinary cinematography by Bradford Young and a pitch perfect atmospheric musical score by Jóhann Jóhannsson (with a little help from Antonín Dvořák!) and first class acting by both Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, this is a film that should be marked as a 'must see' experience – for many many reasons – especially at this point in our earthbound history."
"parkerryane","9","0","7","18 February 2017"," The Beauty of Language
","My sole complaint is an unnecessary montage sequence. That's about it. Villeneuve spreads his resume as a master of science fiction and drama, cementing his auteur status. This IS NOT an alien invasion movie. This is a movie about language and globalism, hidden by the focus of giant spacecrafts that suddenly appear in the sky. That sounds confusing, but once you see this movie, you'll get it. Amy Adams stars in an Oscar-worthy performance as a linguist tasked by an army colonel (Forest Whitaker) with trying to communicate with the visitors, invaders, scientists, whatever they are alongside a physicist (Jeremy Renner). From a cinematic standpoint, this film is beautiful. Beautifully shot, with a great production design, visual effects, and a haunting yet at times beautiful score. This film questions our place in the world yet alone questioning what it truly means to be human. It also questions what we do with power. If we have the power to change something, do we do it. I cannot wait to see what Villeneuve does with Blade Runner and Dune in the not to distant future."
"thomasandres-54232","8","0","6","18 February 2017"," Emotion and Science
","There are now two upcoming directors which I closely follow: Damien Chazelle and Denis Villeneuve. Of Villeneuve I saw Incendies (9), Prisoners (8.5) and Sicario (8), which are phenomenal movies. I love his style, his movies are dark, slow and intense, not to mention very good. So I was pumped to see this movie, but after a very disappointing summer (and year thus far) what could I expect? Much.<br/><br/>I thanked God for this movie that came after a sh!t summer. A breath of fresh air, which is weird as the movie is so dark and slow. Let's start with the story: so a handful of alien ships land on earth with no one having any idea of what they came for or, more importantly, how to communicate. So they find the linguist Louise Banks (Adams) to try and figure out how to speak with the alien visitors.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing, well, Amy Adams is amazing and was absolutely robbed of her Oscar nomination (wake up people). She's so subtly very emotional, she doesn't say much but it's all there. You really feel for her, you believe she is figuring out this way of communicating with aliens. Renner is kind of acting besides her, I mean he's fine but just that. People like to talk about Whitaker in this film, but he didn't do anything, so calm down.<br/><br/>Yes, the script is amazing, clever and surprisingly emotional. The approach that it takes to find a linguist is very realistic and clever. But it is the structure that is important. (If you haven't seen the movie now is the time to go see it you worthless scum.) It takes you by surprise as the whole movie you are trying to figure out what the flashbacks have to do with the story, or to understand the emotions of Banks. The ending is not only humane and beautiful, really beautiful, it's also very smart. The whole movie, and the entirety of what she feels and through her we feel makes sense. The choice she makes is one of love, pure love, in an otherwise very scientific movie. Which is what I loved too, it's all very grounded. The characters are not black and white, they're complex, all of them. But it's the method of figuring out how to communicate with these beings that have nothing in common with the human race that is so interesting and very well handled and thought out. It's suspenseful, clever and the cinematography is amazing. Every movie of Villeneuve looks just gorgeous. The moment you see the ship, just cinema gold. That moment represents how you feel watching the film, standing in awe.<br/><br/>It is an scientific movie that in its core is powerfully human and emotional. Mr. Villeneuve you have done it again!<br/><br/>8.5"

Denis Villeneuve gives a lesson to many other directors that big bold budgeted movies and extravagant ideas are not necessarily essential for a good movie, The movie is deconstructed in a way the mixes reality scenes with past dreams, once sober and once high, It flows between the past and present and that's the beauty of the movie. Human behavior in times of distress is also a major element that pushes the story forward and gives it more meaning.

"gracewoo","10","0","6","15 February 2017"," Great movie; explanation below for those who misunderstand it
","I think it's telling that the people who like this movie, really like this movie and those that don't, really don't. From the reviews on this site of those who didn't like the movie, it appears that these people didn't pick up on the plot details and the implications of the plot structure which is the whole point of the story. The movie moves along deceptively slowly; I say ""deceptively"" because the viewer needs to pay attention. There's actually a lot going on and for those mistaking the movie for being slow, will miss out on an intellectual and emotional ride that makes the thoughtful viewer reflect upon their own decisions and relationships.<br/><br/>Although I doubt that those who have watched it and thought little of the movie will likely stop and reconsider, never mind go back and read a positive review explaining why the movie's great, I nevertheless feel compelled to explain some of what it is that these negative reviewers missed:<br/><br/>{It should go without saying that spoilers abound:}<br/><br/>The structure of the movie is jarring at first with scenes of the daughter interspersed with Louise (the main character)'s first contact with the aliens. This structure is intentional and follows the source material faithfully. It's done in both the movie and its source material short story, to highlight that contact with the aliens have affected Louise's thought process so much so that she is in fact (major spoiler and plot point here) ""remembering the future"". What the audience thought at first as a depiction of Louise's past experience with the death of her daughter possibly colouring her interaction with the aliens, is in fact, we find out near the end, instead a memory of her inevitable future. <br/><br/>And this answers a number of questions many misunderstanding reviewers point out in disgust, one of which being why the aliens, being obviously more technologically advanced than we are, don't just communicate in our language; in fact this is a major plot point - the reason for the aliens being here on earth is to force humans to learn their language. The entire point of their visit, to spell it out for the clueless, is that by forcing us to learn their language, it forces us to see the universe from their perspective, which ultimately gives humans a similar ability that the aliens have to see into the future. It is their gift to humanity and since Louise immersed herself in their language and therefore gained their ability to see into the future, as demonstrated by the flash-forwards we see from the beginning of the movie, they have succeeded in what they came to earth to achieve. Having achieved what they came here to do, is the reason they leave at the end.<br/><br/>The above points brought about some heady realizations and questions for me such as:<br/><br/><ul><li>Knowing that my child would die at a very young age, and with all the growing pains, difficulty of raising a child and aggravation as depicted in the movie (and let's face it, in real life), would I make the decision to have her in the first place? How much do we love our children and would it have been better that they never been born? Is it selfish to have this child knowing she will die before 'full potential' or is this in itself what is selfish, to not have her solely because of my own inevitable heartache?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Being bilingual, I have experienced how different languages affect my fundamental thinking. What they implied in the movie that learning and thinking in a different language gives a person a different perspective and even forces a person to think a certain way, from experience, is a real thing. The science fiction part of that is of course, thinking in this new alien language can cause anyone to be able to see the future. Really knowing a different language and how that changes your thought process is an interesting concept that single-lingual people may not realize exists. And maybe for some multi-lingual people, also brings to consciousness that a different language can shape how you view the world. And isn't that part of what makes stories great, the ability to make you experience and realize things that you wouldn't otherwise get to experience?</li></ul><br/><br/>There are other realizations and heady questions arising from this movie. If only people realized these points instead of dismissing liking this movie as a case of pretentiousness of reviewers and intellectuals."

It was the third story and as I write this I have just started it. The first story involves the building of the 'tower of Babylon' and how in ancient times man built a tower that reached Heaven so they could meet Yahweh (God). The second is about people being given an experimental drug that repairs damaged brains, the more damaged the better the outcome, leading to someone becoming 'superintelligent' and what he does with this. The stories lead to positive outcomes for humanity, as does this film. It is a 'soft' sci-fi film that deals with a first contact scenario. As usual the military are heavily involved from the start with their blinkered outlook and paranoid conclusions. It is up to linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to bring understanding and humanity to the fore. I am looking forward to the end of the original story as I am sure you will enjoy this version."

","I believe ""Arrival"" attracts a very specific portion of public; the group I have in mind comprehends sci-fi fans, of course, but also includes ""skeptical"" viewers. By that I mean those who are vaguely interested in the indefinite flavor of Curiosity which derives from mysterious or catastrophic movies.<br/><br/>The movie, being meant for these two categories, presents a bipartite content : partially, it portrays the classic elements of science fiction (meeting with the Unknown, interaction with it, subsequent change in the protagonist's life). Furthermore, ""Arrival"" presents wider themes: Love, Destiny, Acceptance. <br/><br/>This hybrid nature catches the attention of both kinds of typical viewers, but for different reasons; sci-fi fans might be on the search for intergalactic conflicts, time travel, display of alien technology. The neutral viewers, instead, are presumably interested in witnessing hypothetical apocalyptic scenarios and the personal development of the characters. Well, they both get a taste of what they seek. ""Arrival"" is in fact a rich plate which satiates every kind of appetite and leaves no complaints behind.<br/><br/>The true question however is : is this fictional hunger fully and completely satisfied? The answer is a matter of opinions; mine is negative. The picturesque alien race isn't clearly and exhaustively described or disclosed, as well as their final inscrutable purposes; I believe others in the audience share my same desire to know more of these mighty ""heptapods"". But I guess that was the goal of the authors; if so, mission accomplished."
"dromasca","8","0","4","11 February 2017"," another encounter of the third kind
","Almost every season of American cinema in this period brings about at least one big sci-fi production. While in recent years the themes dealt with space exploration within Earth orbit ( 'Gravity' in 2013 directed by Alfonso Cuaron Sandra Bullock and starring George Clooney ) or the planets of our solar system (Ridley Scott's 'The Martian' with Matt Damon last year), 'Arrival' this year returns (as 'Interstellar' by Christopher Nolan, also starring Matt Damon in the title role of 2014) to one of the themes of most popular in the classical literature and film of the genre and namely contact with extra terrestrial civilizations and possible visits and even invasion of our planet by representatives of civilizations more advanced than ours. <br/><br/>What can bring new another movie in a genre so popular and populated with significant creations, with branches in all genres from science fiction and apocalyptic visions to technological sparkling comedies and fairy tales that turn extra-terrestrial beings in friendly issues and the films in family-friendly productions? 'Arrival' managed to generate interest because it follows two of the basic rules of success in this sub-genre of science fiction. The first is that a film of 'first contact' must have the focus or pay significant space to humans and their real problems, must have heroes in flesh and blood, with whom viewers can identify. Dennis Villeneuve's film has as the main heroine Louise Banks, a beautiful woman but passed beyond the first youth who has just gone through the terrible trauma of losing a child to an incurable disease. The beginning of the film looks more like the beginning of a psychological drama about post-trauma recovery, and this is what this film is actually in some way. But of course, Louise Banks is a doctor in linguistics and because of this expertise is involved in trying to communicate with the passengers of the 12 spacecraft suddenly appeared in sight of earthlings. Intervenes here second compulsory element in the success of the genre which requires the contact between civilizations to combine in suitable doses the mystery and anguish human contact with the unknown and an explanation which has sufficient scientific logic (or humor or poetry, in other films ) to satisfy curiosity but also to stay with the audience after the film. Here lies the secret of the interest and success of the film.<br/><br/>From here starts but actually the most difficult part. For us, people (scientists or movie viewers), imagination is the only tool that we have at hand to imagine how the inhabitants of other planets physically look. Dreams and nightmares may take the forms, but the filmmakers have a duty to bring the extra-terrestrial on-screen, to shape dreams and imagination. Many movie genre filmmakers often failed, because when dreams becomes concrete substance, interest and expectations often melt into disappointment. You can not say that in 'Arrival' this issue is resolved, rather it is avoided or marginalized in style. Extra-terrestrial in Villeneuve's film are seven-legged creatures looking like octopuses, but to relieve the feeling of revulsion or physical danger there always is a screen between them and people. Viewers' attention is directed to the central theme of the film which is the possibility or impossibility of dialogue between civilizations that can be very different in their biological characteristics and stages of development and therefore use highly specific media each.<br/><br/>The main question the heroes in 'Arrival' are faced with is related to the intentions of the extra-terrestrials. To judge them in the image, likeness and intentions of humanity can be a fatal mistake. But ignorance can be fatal and potential hazards are present. Why did the extra-terrestrials come on our planet? What are their intentions? Cooperation or exploration, or conversely, the monopolization of resources (which ones?) on our planet and maybe annihilation? How can be established communication with them, how can their messages be translated when the bases are unknown language they use and even fundamental pillars of their way of thinking are different? I will not give too much detail because I do not want to take away from the joy of watching a film that I recommend to everyone. Of course, the lead heroine plays a key role in the solution of the problem and the answer will come in the end and is related to her biography and traumas that had she went through.<br/><br/>The film is based on a story by writer Ted Chiang, winner of the Nebula Award, one of the most important distinctions of genre, in 2000. The text addresses many aspects of the theory of language, perception of time and determinism underlying human communication, and develops a principle known in linguistics and epistemology as the 'Sapir-Whorf hypothesis' or 'relativity language', after which language determines or at least influences the way of thinking, knowledge, and the decision-making of those who use it. Screenwriter Eric Heisserer and director Dennis Villeneuve found screen equivalents to some of the ideas of the story and added further elements, some more successful (i.e. the very credible 'international' response the arrival of extra-terrestrials) other less to my taste (resolving at the last moment the inter-civilization the crisis that is on the brink of armed conflict seemed too 'Hollywood-ish'). The film's graphics solutions for the relations between civilizations at first contact are well suited and exceptionally aesthetic. There are too many details in this film about extra-terrestrial technology, and about the secrets that they want to transmit to mankind, and all these make this movie worth seeing."
"kjmusto","8","0","3","10 February 2017"," A good'ish SCI-FI movie, was a bit disappointed.
","I really like Denis Villeneuve as an director and he has done some movies I loved: Prisoners, Enemy. So I was really hyped to see him direct a serious sci-fi movie, but I was a bit disappointed with the end product.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>Positives: <br/><br/>The acting by the two main leads were really good. Amy Adams is always great and I was surprised how good Jeremy Renner was. It's a really well shot movie with striking visuals (one poor cgi shot) and images that won't at least leave my head in a while. Soundtrack was also really good.<br/><br/>Negatives: ""How about we just talk to them before we start throwing math problems at them?"" When I heard that line in the first act of the movie I was like OH NO! That's precisely what you should do when you are trying to communicate with an alien civilization. Use a common language: MATH! Start with the prime numbers and build from there. Use simple calculus with pictures: one line plus one line equals 2 lines. But that's just my personal gripe with the movie, but it buggered me so much because I was expecting a hard science fiction movie. <br/><br/>The 2nd biggest problem I had was the stereotypical military guys who are just basically shoot first think later type's and are unwilling to listen reason. ""Let's not communicate with the other landing sites"",""Radio silence!"",""Let's not share our information because nobody shares theirs!"" Like WTF?! are these people in kindergarten or what?<br/><br/>Overall Arrival is an enjoyable watch with your typical Hollywood contrivance that left me wanting something more serious on the science front."
"horsecoach4hire","8","0","6","8 February 2017"," Very emotional film: Wouldn't call it Sci-Fi
","How do I start a review of this film? This film really hit me, in all likelihood because I've recently suffered a loss of a loved one.<br/><br/>The whole premise of this film is about changing the way you perceive and think: From the attitude towards 'aliens' to our concept of time.<br/><br/>If you struggle with movies in which you have to think to watch or want a fast paced alien movie, this isn't your film. This is a far more emotionally deep story about a woman who realizes that the aliens she has been brought to communicate with have been showing her glimpses of her future, not her past.<br/><br/>Even in the beginning, you can sort of have an idea that something isn't following a time-line, and that is a constant in the film: Which, I would argue loses viewers because it IS confusing. The short story followed a much more linear concept of time despite the fact the story-line is about following none linear time.<br/><br/>OK, quick lesson on time: We are taught from day one, that time begins and ends. We are born, we grow, we live, we die. That is linear time. None linear time concepts follow a theory that time is occurring simultaneously on different planes. Meaning, 1988 and 2088 are occurring along with right now, 2017. Ever have dejavu? The concept of this by theorists is that, with none linear time, these different time periods can eventually 'catch up' up to each other, thus crossing over at a split second in time, causing you to feel like ""I've done this before'.<br/><br/>That's just one theory.<br/><br/>This is a risky film---this and Interstellar are working on intense theories and concepts that most people likely chose not to pursue in education--and trying to condense that knowledge in a 5 minute crash course of a Hollywood film can get lost--and it does in Arrival. The actual science is theory, aside from the linguistic aspects, and furthermore, there IS a pacing issue. It does get VERY slow--for a reason mind you--but I found this to start getting a bit tiresome. It was almost as if something had been edited out in post production.<br/><br/>This is more of an emotional drama about living life, and experiencing all of it: The joy, the heartache, the love, the loss-- -and if you knew your life in advance, would you still choose to follow that same path.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie, despite how emotional it made me. If you've recently suffered a loss of a dear loved one, you might want to put this film on hold---it does hit you hard."

","Some language professor named Louise is visited by some military guy after 12 alien spaceships arrive and hover a couple of yards above ground on different places around the world like Montana, Russia, China, Venezuela.<br/><br/>He presents her with some recording of the alien language and asks her what she makes of it. Of course she doesn't make anything of it. He leaves planning to visit some other professor. Eventually she's hired for the gig of deciphering the alien language together with with scientist Ian.<br/><br/>Up the spaceship they go toward something like a large window. On the other side is fog/mist. Eventually 2 aliens appear. Humans call them heptopods for their seven legs. After the aliens warm up to our team, they release some foggy black ink that turns into shapes. The humans conclude it's their actual language not the sounds they make. The shapes are mostly rings with various blots in different places and eventually the humans more or less figure out the what they mean.<br/><br/>At first the humans from the 12 countries are working together. But since all these countries are run by neocon nutjobs who are ready to wage war at any moment, things get more complicated. Info is leaked to the media about what happens during the encounters with the aliens.<br/><br/>At some point the aliens appear to write the word ""weapon."" That makes China go crazy and cooperation between the countries is stopped altogether. The US military too takes more aggressive steps. That's when our team goes rogue and give the aliens one more chance. The alien releases a bunch of these ink circles and Louise has to figure out what it means. All throughout the movie she's been having dreams/visions of her daughter and those will be key to figuring out what's going on.<br/><br/>Arrival starts and ends with some preposterous pompous music. Fortunately, throughout the movie we are spared that stuff. The movie looks rather ugly, a very misguided choice by the director. The spaceship is utterly unremarkable inside and out and everything is rather colorless. The aliens too aren't particularly interesting although more about their presence is revealed later on. Unfortunately, the movie centers on this lame and dull woman. Ian's contributions aren't clear. His job is to be the woman's sidekick, the best a male character can hope for in Hollywood these days. Even Forest Whitaker who is a compelling actor isn't allowed to do much.<br/><br/>Initially, Arrival is very exciting, up to the point where they meet the aliens. Our main characters aren't in charge, no one is, because what is going on is so much larger than any one person or group of persons. But eventually the excitement subsides as the woman's visions that don't make much sense to us yet, or aren't all that relevant after all, take precedence. Those visions for some reason are filmed in richer color and given a better look.<br/><br/>But it's the story here that shines. The symbol for ""weapon"" will turn out to have another meaning as well. And the movie makes clear how easy it is to start wars, for something as simple as an equivocation on a word. Time is also a main issue here as the aliens, unlike humans, aren't stuck in the arrow of time but have greater freedom in time. This freedom is granted to them by their language.<br/><br/>In the end we learn why the aliens arrive, what they say and mean, what Louise's visions are all about, and how what initially looked like catastrophe--the imminent military response by the world powers--was averted. It's meaningful and insightful stuff. However, I'm not thrilled by how it was presented in some overly-dramatic fashion. In some way the audience is also cheated because in the end the story wasn't told entirely linearly, but that was probably necessitated by the story itself. Still, I think it could have been directed/edited in a different, more interesting way. The story is smarter than most these days, but the tone of the movie is a bit arrogant. The movie thinks it's even smarter than it really is.<br/><br/>Arrival is strong movie with a rich intriguing story. It's enlightening but not entirely satisfying. I can't get rid of the feeling that a much better movie could have been made with this material."

","Remember Lucy? That film made by a French director about a girl who took a brain-enhancing drug which gave her abilities beyond logical comprehension. Well, if you do then Arrival, made by another French director, might be something you're prepared for.<br/><br/>Is it completely true? Both yes and no. Yes, because this film tries to take a different path unfolding a rather exploited premise, breaking both the clichés and the barriers of plausibility. No, because this time action is not the means by which the film talks to its audience. Not the main means at least.<br/><br/>It's hard to discuss the film's details without crossing onto the land of spoilers, and you definitely don't want this film to be spoiled for you. But one thing is for sure: if you don't mind some suspension of disbelief and if you perceive cinema not just as a carrier of logically-grounded and scientifically-proved statements but rather as a conduit for emotions, then Arrival is a kind of a movie you might not wanna miss.<br/><br/>At the center of this intertwined whirlwind of human feelings and grand scientific revelations is a figure of Louise Baker (played by Amy Adams), a top-level linguist summoned to establish contact with a group of aliens. Mrs Adams, along with her co-star Jeremy Renner who played Ian Donnelly, a physicist and Louise's colleague, are no strangers to the films featuring extraterrestrial creatures. Yet it's not the sci-fi that has the most value in Arrival. It's the whole gamut of our very human emotions, from fear, anger and desperation to hope, happiness and love. And while there are some nice visuals to please our eyes in this film, and some intellectual claims and assumptions to make our brains engaged, it's the feelings, and how painfully exposed emotion-wise Amy Adams goes to convey them, are what you keep thinking about and sensing once the film is over. And that, in our utterly material world, is an achievement of its own accord.<br/><br/>I still can't get over the obvious parallels with Lucy, something that you'll probably be thinking about as well once you've seen the films. Yet Lucy, albeit so action-packed and fast-paced, felt incredibly hollow inside, so hollow that the absurdity of its premise becomes first apparent and then abhorrent. Here, however, the absurdity is just a single step you only have to take once, in a leap of faith, to reach the connection with what's happening on screen. Just like Louise, who reaches out to the alien creatures to be able to communicate with them in their strange language, this film talks to us and induces thoughts and emotions both familiar and so irrelevant to what's seemingly being discussed. What do we make of our lives? Do we regret our mistakes? Would we change something if we knew what it's gonna end with? Would we wanna keep living at all? There are no correct answers to those questions, neither in this film nor anywhere else, but sometimes even simply asking could make a change. After all, some things are just a reflection of how we see and treat them."

","Generally, science fiction movies about UFOs are quite similar nowadays. Most of them concentrate on the conflicts between human and aliens. Typically, one or two heroes will save the earth with their incomparable bravery and breathtaking grasp of opportunity. However, this one well performed another story of peaceful communication. Only at the end did I realize those ""memories"" are had been from the future. Background music is another advantage of this movie while the color is a little dim for me. But I didn't think over my own life very much according most(it seems like that) reviewers. In a nutshell, it is a fair one but not excellent."
"alanpgini","5","0","5","3 February 2017"," Entertaining but not great
","Very good, its entertaining. Its not the Tour de Force I expected from reviews, but excellent in presenting a different idea or alternative way of living. I give it a 7 of 10 instead of higher, because its too disconnected in its resolution as far as the protagonist is concerned. And its too big of a reach. What she remembers is the issue here. The malleability of time, is what downgrades this a few notches. It leaves way too much to be desired. Adans, Renner, and Whittaker put forward some very good acting. The effects themselves though, are more believable than the premise. Sci fi has been somewhat dumbed down over recent decades. But this one meets the criteria of making you think. Which is what has always been a sign of a good movie to me, sci fi or not."
"Boristhemoggy","5","0","7","1 February 2017"," A lovely film which might only attract sci fi fans, but it has drawbacks
","I loved Amy Adams, and she did not overact as she often does, she played this one to perfection. However, call me dumb but I gave this a 5 which is a big break from most people reviewing the film. Why? Well firstly, once again, no matter how lovely the soundtrack, it should NEVER drown out or distract from the dialogue, yet in this movie it did several times. The dialogue and the pictures are what carry the story and if you miss what they're saying you miss part of the story. It's become de rigeur for directors to supposedly enhance their films recently with great scores, but this trend of drowning out dialogue needs to stop because it is spoiling films. <br/><br/>Secondly, although a great story might always leave something to you to figure out, it should never leave out too much. For me Arrival left out quite a lot to the point that at first watching I have no idea of the timeline of the story. Did she have and lose her child before this alien occurrence? Did she have and lose her child after it? If she lost it afterwards she must have been seeing into the future when she was reflecting on times with her daughter during the same period she was helping to decode the aliens' language. What? <br/><br/>I'm left with feeling there were great parts of the story, with some great cinematography, and some excellent score, but the overall experience was ruined for me by the odd parts of the story that didn't make sense, and the drowning out of dialogue by violins. This could have been a great film, but wasn't."

","I strongly recommend reading the book first, you will loose nothing, just the opposite. It would help you understand what is going on. Movie touches the subject of ""First contact"" and how it would change everything. It strongly points that with no common physcical or cultural background we would have a very tough time establishing any communication. It is some of the best hardcore science fiction in years but I can't get rid off the feeling that creators of this movie got lazy or out off budget at some point. ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang was a short story in itself, but they managed to butcher it down even more! For what? It is still slow and almost meditative movie, what did they achieve by making it much more primitive story? They knew they were making slow science fiction movie and yet they cut all the interesting science and conversations from the book. The character of Jeremy Renner is more like a furniture in this version etc. Also I don't understand the deviation from the original story. They did not make it any stronger or action packed, they just made no sens. Movie is slow paced and focused on attentive audience, great soundtrack and very strong emotional story of main character going through some major revelations and transformations of her personality. Pepsi generation will say it's boring and makes no sens. I would say they are dumb."
"darioilg","8","0","7","19 January 2017"," Interesting, but too reminiscent of other recent sci-fi's
","""Arrival"" begins as countless sci-fi stories begin: a few alien space-ships land (or, in this case ""float"") on Earth and people freak out to understand their intentions. In ""Indipendence Day"" their intentions were bad; in ""District 9"" the aliens become the victims. Here a simple story as this one evolves into something I could call Nietzschean, not to spoil with specifics to future viewers, growing into something I was not prepared for at the beginning. But at the same time this clever story shows some inevitable similarities to other hit sci-fi's of the past few years, first of all ""Interstellar"" by Christopher Nolan. While the first 3/4s of the film work magnificently, the ending feels more like a b-movie finale, with its race against time and predictable solution, although the final speech may bring less philosophically learned audiences food for the mind. It is not clear what the final encounter with the aliens means, though, and I fear that the scene was written that way to justify a sequel in a few years, but maybe it's just me.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve's ""Sicario"" was a 2015 hit movie first of all because of its brilliant visual style. ""Arrival"" is no less so, with more beautiful landscapes and ingenious shots, especially inside the aliens' den. Johann Johannsson is also back for the score, which is true to his minimal style and really manages to enhance the power of some of the best scenes in the central part of the film; I actually didn't really like the use of the very well-known ""On the Nature of Daylight"" at the beginning and end of the movie though, as it feels like a cheap move to trigger an emotional response on the audience with such easy means. The simple design of the aliens and their space-ships is a true winner, being simultaneously mysterious, ominous and intriguing; the language used by the creatures is the greatest value of the whole movie, a true stroke of genius both in its design and in its broader meaning.<br/><br/>It seems like Amy Adams's star has no intention to burn out, as we saw the actress star in two well-praised 2016 movies: ""Arrival"" and ""Nocturnal Animals"" by Tom Ford. While I personally don't like her too much, I must admit she's a true force of nature when it comes to explore emotional acting: in both films her characters undergo intense moments and she acts them out surehandedly and with a magnetic touch, helped by the two visual-heavy directors, who love to linger a lot on her face. Renner's Ian Donnelly is a funny guy, a lot similar in his behavior to the more famous role of his, Hawkeye. As a whole he doesn't do too much, but may be better this way. Whitaker is a great actor and, although his role is not the biggest ever, he stands well between the other mains."
"wheelleg","6","0","3","18 January 2017"," Great visuals but the story is punching above its weight
","Arrival – NO SPOILERS I watched this last night and has taken me a while to makes sense of my thoughts on it. I have steered away from other reviews for fear of spoilers etc so this is a completely objective and personal review of which I'm sure will have a much divided backlash. OK, so lets start with the good : The film itself as a visual product is stunning, no doubt about it, when you have 2 hours set effectively set between a military camp and a huge floating pebble, the visual hook has got to be there, and it was! These visuals compliment the cast, well.Amy Adams perfectly! She really flexed her acting muscles here imo and proved herself an incredibly competent actress and thought she was brilliantly cast for the role and may be the best performance I've seen from her. Her character embodies so many emotions throughout the film and Adams really brings this to life, you believe what shes feeling...grief,excitement,confusion etc. I do however feel the rest of the 'known' actors were sort of thrown in just to rack up a celebrity endorsement. Unfortunately, aside from the great visuals and Amy Adams performance there really wasn't anything else holding this film together. I understood the messages the film was trying to get out there, but when the film finished I found myself not pondering the message the film tried to convey , but ratherwhat was the point in making such a visually impressive film wrapped around such a weak plot/screenplay. The music score I found very odd, in that I like music to dictate the pace of the film and emphasize the tone and emotion of scenes, but with Arrival, it was all just very low and dull which really didn't seem to do anything in terms of highlighting the mood of certain scenes and actually making 'breakthroughs' and pivotal moments seem to come out of leftfield with no sense of tension of build-up. The aliens – I just found them very underwhelming ,and not sure how these giant floating squid like things could build those ships., so assume they just have an unfathomable level of intelligence and technology.which then makes me question how they don't have a way/device of translating with humans? I admire the plot being its own thing and quite unique but imo it was punching way above its weight and as such left me frustrated with the plot holes and issues I had with the consistency of the unfolding story , but that would mean going into spoiler territory and I wont do that!I With that said, there's not really anything else to comment on To sum up, this film is what I would expect if Shyamalan was to tackle a 'Sci Fi' film, and I found It delivered far less than what the first 15mins or so promised. This was a 2 hour journey explaining in a very complicated way the reason behind the alien's arrival and also to show how humanity reacts to something that isn't understood. I will give this a 6/10 , and it's the cinematography and Amy Adams performance that's got it up there."

This is not a movie you watch once and completely understand. But it is entertaining. <br/><br/>Twelve alien spacecrafts arrive on Earth and experts are called in to make contact. The two experts on which the story focuses are interesting. Their path to understanding the aliens keeps you watching while at the same time you cant help feeling some parts are missing.

"fastd03","6","0","3","8 January 2017"," Good as a brainless sci-fi flick, but letdown if you're expecting more
","Arrival, both in pre-release hype and in cinematic progression, builds up its viewers to expect greatness characteristic of select great mainstream 21st century directors like Christopher Nolan and Terrence Malick. At times, even, Arrival's voice overs are reminiscent of Malick's style, or its suspenseful build-up similar to that of Inception or other Nolan pieces. Yet sadly, in the end, Arrival falls far short of those expecting greater things from the movie, devolving into a cheap and corny love story and a complex problem resolved by a silly temporal paradox rather than a more thoughtful/complex solution. The acting quality helps ground this movie in some regards, with good performances from Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner (Forest Whittaker's role is okay, but his fluctuant, sometimes present, sometimes absent accent is a faint scar on a movie supposedly hinging on language and linguistics). If you can release your mind entirely to accept total fluidity of time, then the resolution of the movie - ""past Amy Adams"" at a discrete time learning the solution to the ""Chinese problem"" from ""future Amy Adams"" - then the plot resolution may be at least plausible, but even then it seems horribly cheap and unsatisfactory as a solution for such a complex matter as preventing war with aliens. Moreover, from a language and linguistics perspective, the movie is similarly disappointing, creating what is touted as an immensely complex alien language that - while represented by different symbols that we are familiar with (much like Chinese or Sanskrit, for example), is in fact no more complex in meaning than the languages of Earth (it perhaps has even less depth of language than the massive vocabulary of classical Chinese). And while I, as a former language and linguistics major, correspond to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis that language directly influences the way an individual thinks (of course, in far more words than this), the idea that Amy Adams learns to read the future from a mere few months of exposure to an alien language - which she at that time still barely understands - is such a bastardization of this hypothesis that it really does the hypothesis intellectual harm. Long story short, if you plan to watch this movie, watch it as a sci-fi flick...expecting more, particularly on an intellectual level, will leave you sorely disappointed."

","I would say Arrival is one of the most over-rated movies of 2016. Arrival starts with an overwhelming thrust but you will loose your focus eventually with the run time. If you are a big fan of drama, surely you will like the slow story building but I am pretty uncertain whether you would like the sudden cliché ending/death of the movie, along with your dateless patience. Loopholes are also pretty obvious, though not a big problem to follow the story line.<br/><br/>Arrival might remind you of 2001:Space Odyssey with a heavy flavor of Kubrick style. However, in my point of view, Arrival is crudely made with lack of sophistication.<br/><br/>Now lets say some good words.<br/><br/>Amy Adams was extraordinary, and incredible. I kept wondering on her effort and aptness throughout the movie. Well deserved performance for Academy Award! Soundtracks are well produced, especially the starting and the ending one. I bet you will keep listening the tracks for hours. Hats off to Mr. Richter! <br/><br/>Overall: Recommended, and 7/10."

","Like some of the genre's best, Arrival's strength is in framing an effective science fiction story around a seemingly-unrelated topic and intertwining the two until they become inseparable. In this case, we deal with the fabric of linguistics - the desperate search for a communicative first step - and how even something so dry and cerebral can make for great theatrical drama. Amy Adams is quietly empathic in the central role, a frazzled interpreter with a strong sense of personal loss who pours herself into the work. Against the backdrop of your typical plastic-sheeted, pop-up government research facility, she's our human connection to a very clinical, inhuman situation. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are around, and give their roles an earnest effort, but they're too cookie-cutter and predictable to amount to much. As is much of the third act, unfortunately, when we discard the delicate analysis of words (both spoken and written) and give in to more bombastic, military-driven temptations. At its core, the film really has one great revelation, and while that's effective at first, it's then rehashed and hammered until its sharp edges grow dull. I still see a lot of promise here, and while it's in the groove it makes for an authentically strange, different viewing experience. The work of Arrival's sound design team plays a big part in that, and will surely be recognized when awards season rolls around. The plot's blunt, heavy-handed climax, though, can be a bitter pill to swallow."
"mydistracteduniverse","5","0","3","26 December 2016"," What? No!
","Lets starts honest<br/><br/>I really liked Arrival. Until it turned weird. Then, not so much anymore.<br/><br/>With a class A cast including Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker this should have been a great movie all the way to the end. Except that it wasn't. It was a great movie until it stopped being that. I had high hopes for it and as such I was left slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>Arrival is a good story with a ton of potential for greatness until it got whacked on the head and it all went belly up. For some reason I can't help comparing it to the 1997 movie Contact, starring the iconic Jodie Foster, which kind of had the same problem. Great movie with a great story until the moment it went all pear shaped.<br/><br/>The Story<br/><br/>Twelve pods of unknown makeup and origin have appeared overnight at seemingly random locations around the globe. As to be expected the media goes nuts and social services break down. School is out. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a successful linguistics professor who stands in from of an empty class room the next day. She highly regarded in her field and has done highly classified consultancy work for the government in the past. Because of this it comes as no big surprise when she gets approached by the military. They need her help in decoding the language of the aliens and once that is done they want her to establish communications with the visitors. For this mission she gets a team of people and works closely together with Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist, portrayed by Jeremy Renner.<br/><br/>All twelve pods have positioned themselves at seemingly arbitrary coordinates all over the world. The local governments are scrambling to establish contact with the aliens and try to learn as much as they can about 'their' pods. They all have a fall out about how to proceed and one by one they end up shutting down communication with the rest of the world. Everyone is now acting isolated without knowing what the others are doing or how far they are with their work to decipher the purpose of the visit. This of course creates an explosive situation that threatens to get out of hand when gossip has it that the Chinese are contemplating to nuke their pod in search for answers. This of course is not an ideal situation for anyone, as no one knows if and how the aliens or the neighbours, for that matter, will retaliate.<br/><br/>Here is where it went wrong<br/><br/>In between her work Louise has these strange flashbacks to her family, mainly her daughter. Except that we learn she doesn't have a family nor a daughter. These flashbacks are just that, but that the events have not actually happened yet. They will happen in the future. And that, because she now speaks the aliens language, time doesn't follow in a straight line for her anymore but in parallel strings all mixed up.<br/><br/>Say what?<br/><br/>This is where is turned south for me. I am good with weird and strange. But that was too much for me. In that moment the movie lost its credibility in my eyes. I know there are concepts out there about time and space and astro physics. In fact I am very interest in the subject. I have read several read books and listened to countless podcasts about it. But the way it was done in the movie is just ridiculous. I am very sorry.<br/><br/>Final thoughts<br/><br/>I suppose we can draw similarities to today's society, which is rather trigger happy. We constantly on the cusp of a global catastrophe even without the presence of aliens. This raises the question of what will it take for humankind to step back from the abyss. What is needed for people to start working together instead of against each other?<br/><br/>Arrival also touches on another question. A moral one that people ask themselves daily. If you knew the future and the way your life would turn out to be, would you change anything? If you knew that by accepting the greatest gift and joy you would ever get, you would also set yourself up the the most desperate pain. Would you still chose the same path?<br/><br/>Its a powerful message. I just wish they would have found a different way to convey it."
"fahycolm","7","0","3","14 December 2016"," Almost Pitch Perfect sci-fi, despite a doubty sub-plot on women's choices
","THE ARRIVAL from Quebecer, Denis Villeneuve, (Oh the Gods! How we have waited for this day from the director of the stunning INCENDIES), tells a tale of seemingly environmentally attentive aliens arriving by the dozen-load on Earth. However, the arrival occurs against the backdrop of a significant communications problem - language. (What about the Star Trekking universal translator? I hear you moan. Yes. Well. Whatever.). The clear and present comprehension gap needs rapid resolution. Luckily, the brilliant (and she is here) Amy Adams is on hand as a student-less polyglot linguistic expert - Louise Banks. So, what could go wrong in any encounter between the enchanting Adams and a pair of representative seven legged beings from another planet charmingly nicknamed Abbott & Costello? Well, as someone who saw every single Abbott and Costello movie, (three times), (before the age of eight) (possibly seven), I had my early suspicions something could go awry. And it did. Only, I was expecting it to be the aliens fault (OK, I did think the good folk of Kenema, Sierra Leone, were not mentioned for nothing). As it happens, it turns the upheaval comes via the subplot and not the startlingly huge heptapods. Darn. I almost loved The Arrival. Almost. As a thinking person's sci-fi film goes, this was headed right for cerebral cortex coinage. <br/><br/>A gritty pacing spins the treadmill beneath the feat (feet) of this Ted Chiang (""Story of Your Life"") inspired invasion, pounding along to a heart arresting soundtrack laced with stalking references to primitive rhythms, Aramaic chants and gong and grumble rumbles worthy of the resurrection of Stanley Kubrick. The science too, the basis of linguistics alone, not to mention the clever nod to Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan's floating multipods in Alien design, is utterly captivating without flinging all the complexities that say Noma Chomsky could throw at you. Who knew that the roots of Portugese could be so nail- bitingly gripping? (Ok, I did! Anyhoo...). And we should offer a medal of honour to the folks in lighting and matte. It rarely looks so convincing. K-Ching!<br/><br/>Villeneuve has a brilliant cast on hand to draw us slavishly right into the belly of this epic encounters tale. Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker), the brilliant Forest Whitaker (Last King of Scotland, Crying Game) and of course the (could-one- possibly-be-more- thesbianistically- dextrous) Amy Adams (tearing Hollywood careers apart with her performances) all join in to stamp the slightest whiff of absurdity into the muddy Montana highlands. Adams's quivering ordinariness pouts and pours tension out in such chilling spades as to harden the butter on one's popcorn. Her character (Banks) is burdened with the unenviable task of going into the alien ship to try and develop a line of communication with, possibly, the ugliest things that have never walked the face of Earth. But, if she was in any way indifferent to the simmering interplanetary Bay of Pigs looming on the horizon, then her own subplot gives her a good excuse to get aboard. As a mother who has lost her only child to an incurable disease, what has she got to lose? <br/><br/>Though the emotive propeller of Bank's past is an important character piece in itself, underpinning the essence of her inner feminine strengths, there comes a point at which the viewer learns that those particular strengths are conveyed as distinguishing her from other women because of the choices she has made. Ouch! Right here The Arrival lands a value judgment that is, at least, open to question. Without giving away the story-line it is important to point out that though this is a subplot, it emerges at the end of the film in a prominently delivered verdict on the choices one makes in life. Hardly an accident in a film with a 50 million dollar budget one guesstimates. Hollywood of is often accused of playing the Democrat game in US politics, but the truth is that was never the case. Actors yes, maybe, but studios - never. Here is a solid example of conservative studio bosses playing to the new audiences they must have sensed were coming over the horizon, unlike the heptapods who arrived unannounced. And it seems with one of these two sets of interlocutors the message is on target. And it is a pity that a sci-fi film should end up being a vehicle for this kind of moralising. Because, this is exactly what does not make a great sci- fi movie, despite all the other ingredients being (dare I say it?) pitch perfect."
"Al_The_Strange","8","0","3","15 December 2016"," Arrival (2016) Review
","If we ever do meet an extraterrestrial race, our first biggest hurdle will be communication. Say the right things, and mankind could make a friend. Say the wrong things, and it could be war. It may not even be war with them, but war among ourselves, as we struggle to comprehend who they would be and what would they want.<br/><br/>These are the things that Isaac Asimov's dreams and HP Lovecraft's nightmares are made of, and it's also the focus of Arrival. In this slow-burning sci-fi drama, big alien discs appear around the Earth, and a language professor joins a government science team attempting first contact. Communication is the basis for all the conflict in this film, to the point where physical action and stakes come up dry. What it does accomplish effectively is building tension on the core dilemma, thanks to the gradual build-up of political pressure.<br/><br/>The story has a lot of merit and is worth seeing, even if it's been done before. Chances are nobody remembers a humble made-for-TV film Epoch, which was also about a strange alien rock that appeared and challenged scientists to decipher its message in the shadow of political stress. Arrival carries over all those same ideas, but with substantially better quality. Cinematography, dark though it is, boasts very solid photography, with shots that are occasionally evocative. Performances are top-notch--I've never seen so much emotional range from Amy Adams before, I continuously forgot it was her acting. Writing is fine. This production has really nice-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects. The music score has some odd quirks, but marries well with the film.<br/><br/>As a story, Arrival demands attention by toying with audience perception in ways that makes viewers wonder about what's really going on between the lines and what will happen next. There is a long dry spell in the opening quarter or so where tension and stakes are absent--these scenes are probably the weakest, but might hold up better on repeat viewings. The middle, with all its wonder and mystery, is properly captivating. The climax is gripping, but wraps up in a very fast and tidy manner--maybe a little quick for my liking. But this is accomplished by a natural quirk of the story involving the perception of time--it's a major plot point and theme, and it even prompts a more experimental cutting of the film to string the narrative to its natural conclusion. It's a style and twist befitting a Christopher Nolan film, but without killing credulity. If anything, most of Arrival holds up to scrutiny in its tight circle of a plot.<br/><br/>One thing that is hard to swallow is the sudden love story that pops up towards the end. With zero chemistry between the characters in question, this comes off as an abrupt way to tie up one or two loose ends that could have been left alone. At the same time, maybe chemistry isn't needed, given the circumstances of the overall story. Knowing the full circle of what happens, it fits in its own way, even if it feels like it shouldn't.<br/><br/>This is not a film to watch for action--it's a high-brow sci-fi drama with an intimate focus on character, plot, and themes. There is a slight undercurrent that carries the same fears and themes of a movie like The Day the Earth Stood Still, and it's enough to ensnare willing viewers in its delicate loop of a story. For the unwilling viewers who want more zing, I hear there's a cool new Star Wars movie! 4/5"

","This contains minimal spoilers! Arrival is not your typical alien movie where suddenly, the Earth finds itself in a war with hostile extra- terrestrials. Arrival brings so much more depth to the table and really strives to make the viewer think outside of the box... or pod. The beginning of the movie starts off with so much mystery. What are the pods? How many of them? And ultimately leaves the initially unanswered question of ""What is their purpose here?"" This question is continually asked throughout the film and is eventually answered close to the very end just as all Hell is about to break loose at the hands of Russia and Japan. With a wonderful twist, the ending is a surprise and adds to the mystery of life in the Universe. ""What is their purpose?"" ""What is our purpose?"" These questions remain, but Arrival gives a beautiful possibility."
"jtindahouse","6","0","3","14 December 2016"," Didn't draw me in like Villeneuve's previous work
","Denis Villeneuve has proved himself to be a very thought-provoking and intelligent filmmaker. Both 'Enemy' and 'Prisoners' were terrific films that left you thinking long after the credits rolled. Now, he has delivered us 'Arrival' and gone down a similar path. There's certainly a lot to think about and consider after leaving the cinema. The problem is that unlike his previous films, I'm not sure I care enough about the story to bother. This one didn't hook me in like the others. I wasn't enthralled with every scene needing to know what would happen next.<br/><br/>The concept of aliens in film always seems to be a popular one. People are fascinated by them and I suspect they genuinely crave the experience of aliens coming to Earth. So a film that explores that prospect is always going to be popular. I do think it can lead to some lazy film making in places though. Because aliens don't exist, or are at least not yet discovered, there are no rules that you have to follow. Anything goes. If you want time travel to apply, it's as easy as saying that it does. You can have them look however you want, have their ship look however you want and give them any physical abilities you so choose. Whatever suits your story best I suppose.<br/><br/>'Arrival' is a very well made film. It's beautifully shot and terrifically acted. It's a sci-fi film that also tries to be a drama and draw on your heart strings. In some places it tries to be too smart for its own good and just ends up getting messier than it needed to though. I think the biggest problem I found however was the characters. They were dull and seemingly unhappy people. If your characters aren't any good it's hard to care. Altogether I think 'Arrival' is a middle of the pack alien flick."
"kstjam","7","0","3","13 December 2016"," Good movie for date night or save it to watch on DVD
","There is something to be said for reading reviews before going to see a movie. However, after having my expectations built up by my spouse, then dimmed by spoilers and some disparaging reviews, I didn't know what to expect.<br/><br/>**Contains spoilers** Sorry! Since these spoilers are out there anyway, I don't mind repeating them.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully shot, not much CGI, instead focusing more on human emotions and the main character, Louise - not the aliens or their spaceship. Anyone expecting to see Star Wars- like action or Star Trek alien technology, will be disappointed or 'bored to death', as some reviewers found it. Amy Adams performance is powerful and nuanced, drawing you into the story and making it totally believable. The supporting cast performance from Forest Whitaker is also perfectly executed, walking a fine line between balancing military goals and human nature.<br/><br/>The story line is not really unique and doesn't provide the ground breaking 'Aha!' moments of films like 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' or 'Matrix'however it does explore important aspects of what could actually happen when trying to communicate with an alien race. Just to clarify a few misconceptions from the bad reviews those aren't a ""million random cut scenes of babies, people passing away and other mundane rubbish"", rather they are the crux of what the story is about – the past, present and future. Clearly this person was not watching the movie! <br/><br/>The physicist played by Ian is not 'useless' or just a love interest; he helps to design the algorithm used to decode the symbols communicated by the aliens; he collaborates with other scientists around the world and together they uncover the key to the alien language. It is entirely plausible, based on the mathematical models used. It's not just a sudden and magical deciphering of ""random scribbling"", as one skeptic put it. In fact, the movie took great pains to explain the logic and progression – Louise using basic English grade school level words and learning their symbols through daily repetition, for several months. (This was augmented by similar steps taken by other scientists at other sites, who shared what was learned – so there is a multiplier effect to the learning curve). <br/><br/>The aliens seem to readily understand English language but humans were unable to understand their response. This presents a dilemma as the communication between both parties grows – are they speaking the same language with the same meaning? Note that all the countries break through the communication barrier, albeit in different ways. They all interpret the message – but is the message received correctly? Louise does a lot to educate the audience on the finer points of communication.<br/><br/>The critique of the 'rogue soldier' and roles of generals running things on the ground in the US or other foreign countries, are plausible plot points. Several events highlight the fear response that most people would have to this unique situation. The fact that generals are on the front line dealing with the aliens and not the President (or heads of State) is a realistic security protocol. Don't expect the President to be hands-on, like in 'Independence Day'. Rather, it's clearly shown that the soldiers are not ultimately 'in charge' as they have to report every development to the CIA and Pentagon, where the tactical decisions are made.<br/><br/>Some of the finer points missed by some – the use of infinity symbols - a circle, the number '8' also, '12' (found in several cultures, meaning completeness and perfection).<br/><br/>The music complements the scenes well, underscoring the gravitas of the performances and seriousness as the situation grows more urgent and dire, ironically, in a race against time.<br/><br/>I give Amy props for a solid performance. She is such a reliable and versatile actress, (from Enchanted to American Hustle, Man of Steel) she refuses to be typecast – this latest role highlights her depth, in an Oscar-worthy performance. Also nice to see two Toronto newscasters make cameos in the closing scenes! <br/><br/>The film overall deserves a 7/10 as there aren't any new or ground- breaking concepts presented. There isn't much scale or grandeur requiring a big screen or sound; there are mostly tight shots of the actor's faces – thank goodness Amy is pleasing to look at. Otherwise, this could easily be reserved for the small screen.<br/><br/>The dilemma of the communication and misinterpretation is the issue. Does mankind come together to solve the problem or does each seek to singularly benefit from the 'gift'/'weapon' or 'tool'? It also makes the larger point that despite the frailty of the human condition, in spite of our failings or because of it – life is still worth living."

And being hyped as the flick of 2016 I went for it with precaution.<br/><br/>It's not your usual Sci-Fi flick. This do has aliens but it's more about understanding them and asking why they are on earth. so there's to be honest no action going on and it's all about blah blah and going back again and again to the spaceship. But even as it clocked in around 2 hours I never found it boring. But I can understand that people seeking for shooting and action and horror or creepy moments will be disappointed. <br/><br/>It does have a rather creepy score especially when they enter the spaceship. But at the end of the movie I was left with many questions. What about those 3000 years they are talking about. Why were they here on earth and why they left. <br/><br/>On part of effects, even there it's low.

Just about the time of the reveal and on I think the pace of it dropped. I appreciate the language aspect/symbol element of what went on but it was long and not always interesting. I liked the end though. Without going into detail of what happened the film's form of narrative is worth praising especially as the credits roll. Pacing is not always perfect in the film. Sci-fi lovers will probably love this film but I think its predecessors do it better. Definitely worth a watch but not over the moon about all of it.

","Firstly, great trailer displaying all the exciting clips from the movie, made me want to watch this despite never heard of ""The Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang.<br/><br/>Plot: From the beginning the scenes already hinted strong characteristic traits on a sci-fi alien movie. The first half of the movie seems legitimately haunting and frightening. As the movies past it's halfway point you realized it's not focus on exploration technologies, but focus on humanity and how we see ourselves in time. I really like intellectual stories and how it present a deeper message. <br/><br/>Characters: Amy Adams did a fantastic job in this film, she basically carried this movie with her performance as the Dr. Louise Bank as a woman with strong personal ""back stories"" and reflect them when she was on the mission to interpret languages for the government. I love how her character is sometimes giving ""flashbacks"" between tasks and the different emotions throughout her progress. Sadly her wonderful performance is the only memorable character in this film, either Jeremy Renner or Forest Whittaker showed strong performance which is understandably due to the nature of the script, but still disappointment. <br/><br/>Effects: Great visual and sound effects, but the cinematography struck me the most. There were a few reoccurring shots usually similar layout and techniques really standout from the other sci-fi movies. There was a wide shot vertically from top to front into frame perfectly focusing on the background objectives and telling stories of the character without any dialogues. I love how the cinematography has a pattern or theme that strongly emphasize some deeper and hidden messages. I will say it is the best thing from this movie and certainly deserve all the praises and awards.<br/><br/>Opinions: Personally I really enjoy this film despite the nature of the plot and ending confuses some younger audience and leave them scratching their heads. I just feel the plot is too multi layered in the second half of the film. I can see it draws resemblance from Contact(one of my all time favourite movie) and Intersteller, but the final payoff comes is not well. The pacing is slow and lack of excitement compare to the ones I mentioned, overall it comes out too artsy to younger viewers with overloaded information and layers, which is unfortunate. <br/><br/>Rating: 7.5. Definitely one of the better Sci-fi film and strong individual performance by Amy Adams, can see it won awards on cinematography and lead actress in the following award season. Unfortunately slightly pale and slow in some areas compare to few recent sci-fi movies with similar structure. Still a recommendation movie."

I enjoy nearly all scifi and I particularly enjoyed this director's previous big movie, Sicario, about the drug war in the Southwest and Mexico. However, I was unexpectedly bored most of the time while I was watching this one. For one thing, as is true of most hard scifi scripts, the majority of ordinary humans are dismissed as hysterics or religious zealots. That left me cold. Any movie that casts Forest Whitaker, no matter how many awards he has, is going to make me wish all of his scenes had subtitles as a hurriedly mumbles through all his lines. Finally, the whole ""the world as we know it will melt down into an apocalyptic disaster unless our hero gets this right"" is almost always an unconvincing crisis. I never felt like anyone was really in the kind of imminent danger the author wanted me to feel, so all there was to do was admire the scenery and the occasional special effect. The story needed more characters, more tension between them, and more interesting and less predictable dialog. Nice try."

","I didn't plan on seeing the film because I thought it was going to be another rehash of 2001 and Childhood's End and in a sense, it borrowed some ideas from those classics mentioned but in the end I was surprised to see that Arrival had a different spin on the genre. And most of all, I was surprised at Villeneuve's directorial prowess. This was a beautifully shot film.<br/><br/>Its hard to describe this film without giving too much away. All I will say is that the film is more about the final message than any character driven drama. It took me a good 10 minutes of reflection after leaving the theater to soak everything in and I found Arrival to be a very cryptic film, and a film that is very relevant to real world events. It's not so much a science fiction film but more of a spiritual film, and a film that will make people take a close look at themselves, our civilization and humanity in general. All in all, a very positive movie, that will leave you feeling uplifted in the end."
"Garrett_Thorne","9","0","3","30 November 2016"," Great performance from Amy Adams!!
","Arrival is one of the best that I have seen this year! Right from the jump you get an amazing opening sequence that to me really attaches you to the character Louise Banks played by Amy Adams. And this is one of her stand out performances so far in her career. I went in to this movie completely blind without seeing any reviews or any trailers, so honestly going in I was expecting this movie to be just another ""SIGNS"" type of film that we've seen 1000 times. But the way they did this film was beautiful, like they way they focused on the communication aspect and not just the war that you often see from films of this nature, so it felt very fresh and new and exciting. And most of that was carried by Amy Adams and the way she was able so easily to connect with the aliens, it seemed like she was really talking to them. Sticking to the actors and there performances in this film, in this movie Jeremy Renner plays a scientist, that is kind of like Amy Adams side kick in away, I just wish they would have done more with him and his character, because I feel like Renner has never really gotten an opportunity to shine in a movie like this, it feels like his character is never used to his full potential, and I think Renner is a very talented actor that just hasn't gotten that golden opportunity. <br/><br/>Another thing I really enjoyed is the directing of this film by director, Gavin O'Connor, who has directed things like Warrior in 2011, and more recently The Accountant in 2016. O'Conner just does amazing in this film, like the first scene that you actually see the alien pods, it just blows you away. He really steals the show in this movie, it is honestly some of his absolute best work ever!<br/><br/>Now lets talk about the ending... I don't want to get into any spoilers, but to me although I loved the ending, if feel like it would've been better if they further explained it. It felt so rushed at the end and leaves you asking questions. Most of the ending makes perfect sense but there is just this one aspect that doesn't quite add up. <br/><br/>All in all this movie is one of the best of the year hands down, I would definitely recommend this film! I loved and left the theater asking questions and really excited about the movie, and this is a film I could definitely see stealing the show come Oscar Night!"

","I am a big sucker for first contact stories but decent movies in this category are very rare. Arrival is one these rare gems which are worth your money. The cinematography is breathtaking and is supported by a very fitting score. On the acting side Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner delivered, although i still wonder why Jeremy Renners Character was needed at all. The true star of this movie is the plot, as i should be and i wont spoil a bit of it. There are a few rather illogical twists but they don't disturb the experience as a whole (well except for one, but i let you be the judge of it). If you are a SciFi fan this movie is a must. I consider it to be the best serious (or hard) SciFi flick i have seen in a decade."
"mark-durfor","7","0","5","28 November 2016"," Arrival Delights and Confuses
","The answer to ""Are we alone in the galaxy"" has been answered in Arrival as a dozen mysterious spacecraft land in various locations across the earth. The government brings in linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnely (Jeremy Renner) to attempt to communicate with whatever might be inside. She and her team must find a way to discover the truth of their intentions as the world prepares for the possibility of global war.<br/><br/>The preview showed two different sides completely sure that their interpretation of the situation is correct. The government and military are convinced that the aliens are here with the intent to destroy while Banks believes they are not our enemy. Making contact with the aliens inside the pods is not a difficult task as they have made themselves available to the human race through an opening in the pod. Once inside, they are separated by a protective barrier, presumably due to atmospheric restraints, but they are able to see and hear each other. The humans rely on pen and paper while the aliens have a sort of squid ink technology coming from one of their appendages that form shapes. Banks is able to interpret the shapes and starts the slow process of communication that will hopefully reveal their intent. She is told they are out of time and that action must be taken. So she does, but it isn't what the military had planned. Those promoting the film promise a surprise ending that will have viewers talking for quite a while after the movie is over.<br/><br/>There have been plenty of alien movies throughout the years. While some portray them in a peaceful light (E.T. the Extraterrestrial, StarMan, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Cocoon), others show a very violent side to the visitors (Independence Day, Cowboys & Aliens, The War of the Worlds). Regardless of their intent, it is always a terrifyingly unknown situation and the residents of planet Earth are immediately frightened at the catastrophic possibility rather than optimistic. While Arrival isn't of the variety of blockbuster explosions that made some of the alien movies into hits, it does deliver a gripping and fascinating drama. <br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of Amy Adams. She is joined by Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker in what I anticipated to be a very well executed alien film on all fronts: special effects, acting, drama, original story, and intensity leaving you breathless at the end. Well, it didn't exactly leave you breathless . . . more like confused, especially if you haven't read the story on which the movie is based. I gave Arrival a very hopeful and optimistic 4 Star prediction, but I've knocked that down slightly to 3.5 stars. Much of the movie had confusing flashbacks that led to revelations of communication with the aliens. But those confusions only made me more excited to see the big wow ending we were all promised. At the end, I was even more confused as it was no longer clear if the visions Banks had were memories or premonitions. And instead of saying, ""Woah, did that just happen?!"" I sat there saying, ""Wait, what just happened?!"" I definitely need to watch this again, but I thought Adams and Renner gave wonderful performances, the special effects were perfect, it was original, but I think it missed the ball on driving the whole point home at the end with clarity. Some I've talked to have commented that the book is much more clear and would help make more sense of the movie. I'll be watching this at least one more time; and, who knows, the second time around might tip the scales to me wanting to own Arrival in my personal collection. <br/><br/>www.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com"

"miles-thatsme","7","0","5","25 November 2016"," Good but too ambitious
","American cinema cannot do a 'modest' first alien contact piece. Maybe it's impossible, retelling the most important event in human history, relentlessly re-conceived by the genre. Or at least awfully hard for Hollywood, stacked with technologists rather than self-conscious anthropologists.<br/><br/>One approach is not to take the enterprise too seriously, and spin it as parable (District 9). Another is to interpose an intermediary culture (the kids or seniors in ET, Cocoon). Yet another is to rely upon a work of genius for the intellectual parts (Contact), but keep it light on details. But 90% of the genre is just too ambitious (Interstellar).<br/><br/>What usually doesn't work entirely are gimmicks that attempt to invert the piece when the logic of the plot unravels somewhat (""you only think plot element X makes no sense because you've been thinking about the whole plot wrong""). <br/><br/>Arrival indulges in these gimmicks, and another, less common one in Hollywood sci-fi, which is probably winning Arrival plaudits. It pulls away from the cerebral and drops into long, quiet, behind-the- shoulder Terrence Mallick sequences. The personal. (Cynics will say this was a calculated move to appeal to non-sci-fi or female audiences and pull for an acting Oscar).<br/><br/>None of this makes for a *bad* movie, unless your expectations of alien first contact are messianic. It's passably fresh, well-acted and visually understated. The direction struggles a little with pace (urgent and languid) and tone (cacophonous and dreamy). But it's enjoyable."

","I really wanted to love this film, but found it wanting. All those glowing comments by reviewers that cannot have had much exposure to the classics or the work of Andrei Tarkovsky; to whom this is a clear homage. It just made me wonder what he would have achieved, had he lived past his 54 birthday. Then there are the nods to Christopher Nolan and Gareth Edwards and I really did not get the comparisons to Contact.<br/><br/>I struggled to suspend disbelief at the beginning as special effects were explained, not shown; wanting so hard to be a big picture. Glad I did persevere, still wondering how it cost so much to make. Sunshine; for example cost a fraction of this budget, mind you it did not surprise me Danny Boyles next film swept the Oscars."
"Alex-Siddhi","8","0","3","21 November 2016"," 'Why Are They Here?'
","This is a sensational Sci-Fi. It really touches upon some of our most crucial thoughts and questions as a species that have not been explored in these ways before on the big screen.<br/><br/>Right from the very beginning there appears to be some sort of visit from a much higher intelligent life form. They appear in pods or 'shells' spread across the globe that do not use any kinds of energy that we are aware of. Of course the military get involved and the United Nations are deciding how to respond to these 'visitors'. This is where Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) comes in, as an expert linguist she is sent in to the Shell that has settled in Montana which has a different frequency of gravity to Earth, once inside she attempts to communicate with the extraterrestrial life forms who appear and eventually they communicate back, they use very unique circular complex symbols to write on a transparent wall that separates the humans from the aliens. This barrier symbolises not only the difference between the beings in this situation but also the language barrier for a struggle to connect. But Dr Banks breaks this down and it is her journey into this break down that really drives the plot further.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film because it portrays these higher life forms in a way that not many other films do at all. They have arrived not invaded, they are not simply attacking us, they have reached our home and are here to help and be helped, which I actually found very convincing, it also took away this senseless need of ours for action in fiction, it was not explosive it was speculative and I think that is much more creative.<br/><br/>What was also touched upon in this film which was very curious was the perception of time from the alien's point of view, because they do not interpret time in a linear format like the way we do, and after Dr Bank's connection with these beings she too opens up this ability within her and this has a deep effect on the story making it very emotional and ever so fascinating to have a glimpse of their perception of time. It was all intelligently put together by a human being's touch.<br/><br/>Amy Adams delivers again another fantastic performance along with Jeremy Renner & Forest Whitaker that really glue this groundbreaking sci-fi drama together."
"CineMuseFilms","7","0","8","19 November 2016"," spindly aliens arrive, we discover they have circular memory, America saves the planet again.
","Ever since the silent film A Trip to the Moon was shown in 1902 audiences have turned to Science Fiction for creative images of life beyond earth. Some Sci-Fi's emphasise alien threats, their appearance, or their technology. The film Arrival (2016) takes a different approach by looking at the challenges of language when first contact is made. Under a thick layer of American propaganda, the film also offers a sermon about global cooperation.<br/><br/>The central storyline is simple: twelve huge elliptical extra-terrestial objects arrive on earth and hover just above ground level in twelve locations across the globe. While each nation carries out its own threat assessments, the Americans opt to explore how to communicate with the visitors rather than default to military options. Our heroine is accomplished linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) who leads a team assigned to enter the spacecraft and assess if humans can communicate with the visitors. Paired with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) they represent the soft and hard faces of science. When contact is made with the tentacled aliens via a glass-like wall it becomes evident that dialogue is possible using a form of circular symbols.<br/><br/>Global panic erupts when linguistic trial and error decodes a symbol for ""weapon"" and China prepares to attack even though Louise believes the translation is ambiguous. In the midst of the crisis, she is haunted by visions of her daughter who died of a rare disease. The visions gradually transition from memories to predictions. Unlike human linear memory the aliens have circular memory that connects the past, present and future. Her flashbacks and flash-forwards are the key to understanding the film but they add a layer of narrative confusion in the process.<br/><br/>The film's unsurprising message is that when alien contact occurs the future of the planet will depend on global cooperation. This theme is packaged inside a story that is told with digital effects that are modest by today's standards. Some will feel let down by the unimaginative spindly alien forms that are kept at a hazy distance within the concrete bunker-like spaceship setting. The back- story of Louise's personal life is a distracting melodrama and the concept of memory circularity is a weak idea on which to base the plot. That the Hollywood dream-factory makes America the global saviour again is not new. Unlike other visually ground-breaking Sci-Fi's this one is more about ideas than spectacle. But it is a thought-provoking film about the technology of language and it works well at this level."
"maurice_yacowar","8","0","3","12 November 2016"," Linguist prevents attack against aliens
","Structure is theme in Canadian director Denis Villeneuve's Arrival. The two interwoven plot lines embody the distinction between our linear time and the broader perspective that reveals the past and the future as well as the present. That's the perspective we would get from outer space, from beyond our normal experience and apprehension. <br/><br/>The space alien plot unwinds in simple linear story telling. It introduces creatures who have that greater perspective. The aliens have come to earth to provide the wisdom we need to survive. They have foreseen a disaster 3000 years from now in which they will need us. They now give Dr Louise Brooks the gift of their wisdom, their perception of the future and the past. With the latter she can win over the Chinese general by telling him his wife's dying words. <br/><br/>With the former she can foresee the heartbreak that awaits her — but she embarks on that journey even knowing its pain. Life and love are worth it. <br/><br/>Louise's story — her marriage, her bearing, raising and loss of her daughter — is told in a non-linear mode, leaping back and ahead, because of that greater perspective the aliens gave her. <br/><br/>This difference also distinguishes their two languages. We speak in linear sentences that unfold over time. The aliens communicate in whole circles, with instant complete structures. They see a whole where we only see a part.<br/><br/>Because the film opens on Louise and her daughter we initially think the alien plot happens after her divorce and her daughter's death. In the first scene Louise tells her infant that they are at a beginning or an ending. That's truer than we realize, because the film ends on the beginning of that marriage. <br/><br/>The family narrative starts at the end of the film, when Louise has published her dictionary of the aliens' world language and is about to marry and have a child with scientist Ian. This plot- line is like the snake biting its tail — or the instant complete circle that is the basic form of the aliens' language. The film's first scene actually happens after its last. <br/><br/>The aliens' broader vision and understanding provide the genre's familiar lesson — mankind has to overcome its delusions of difference and rivalries and its mortal competitions, to embrace a common humanity. That lesson is as old as The Tower of Babel, here replayed as the wall of TV screens on which the 12 nations visited by the aliens at first communicate and share knowledge, but then shut down out of mutual fear and suspicion. The aliens have brought their message in 12 distant instalments because they need us to overcome our animosities and superficial differences to work together, to harmonize. <br/><br/>As in so many alien creature films, the military's first impulse is to attack them. Here at least they make an attempt to learn to communicate with them first, but panic when the language difference kicks up the term 'weapon' instead of 'tool.' For the frightened any hint of danger can trigger aggression. Unfortunately, the unknown seems always to trigger our fear, whether our aliens are from outer space or another culture. <br/><br/>In this film the military is fortunately checked by the linguist and the scientist. Seeing world governments embrace science over their old ideology is extremely heartening but — especially after The Election — not a very convincing assurance."
"christian94","9","0","5","17 November 2016"," Villeneuve is masterful, but hints on mainstream while missing some opportunities
","Aliens, first contact, language and non-linear or circular time are all the elements of great science-fiction films like Contact (1997) and Interstellar (2014) which prevail in Arrival (2016) which just arrived in theatres last week. <br/><br/>Three of Steven Spielberg's sci-fi movies deal with first contact: Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial (1982) and War of the Worlds (2005). They all approach it very differently. Here Denis Villeneuve who's last five films I have enjoyed immensely does a superb job with the material and keeps it edgy and unconventional. He focuses on the unorthodox methods and wonder of linguist Dr. Louise Banks, played by Amy Adams, while she tries to decipher the intentions of aliens arriving on Earth. <br/><br/>The movie is getting rave reviews by critics and moviegoers alike and I am proud as a Quebec native myself and a fan of the humble and fantastic filmmaker. However, I must admit a few things prevented me from connecting completely with the characters and the narrative here. The science and language part are well dealt with and with occasional humour, but I am very critical about the constant military framework and the claustrophobic feel that does not insight fear or more importantly enough wonder.<br/><br/>Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and even more so Zemeckis'Contact (1997) had at their core wonder and danger. Jodie Foster's portrayal of Ellie has a deep passion, reverence and awe about her opportunity to be the primary first contact human that I didn't quite find in Louise's matter-of-fact character<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker is underused and almost one-dimensional, while Jeremy Renner delivers as Ian, but is no Matthew McConaughey. It is possible that no science-fiction movie will equal the elevation of Contact, but if a director could have done it, I had my bets or hopes on Villeneuve. He seemed happy with the script by Eric Heisserer, but I think it could have been better adapted from Ted Chiang's short story I have admittedly not read yet.<br/><br/>I did not connect with any character. Did we need more screen time to get to know General Shang (Tzi Ma)'s perspective and related to the fear? Could the daughter scenes capture more moving and relevant elements? The movie remained intellectual, but I did not get the emotional and visceral part.<br/><br/>I was hoping brilliant composer and Villenuve's partner in crime, Jóhann Jóhannsson, could help simultaneously alienate and intrigue us. Perhaps help make us fear and feel, but he lacks his usual swagger here and Max Richter in facts provides the best sonic complement with its song ""On the Nature of Daylight"" also used by Scorcese in Shutter Island (2010) which Villeneuve integrates to the compelling opening, but that somehow lost some of its appeal by the end reprise when some elements and emotions do not quite fit.<br/><br/>Again the militaristic feel worked well in Sicario (2015), but I found it had less it's place here or should have been better balanced not to end up as a caricature if showing pacific and scientific aims may have higher values was a goal.<br/><br/>The major plot twist and the climax worked well. The scene when Louise actively confronts the chain of command is riveting, but contrasted to lackluster other scenes where Louise drifts off and does her thing almost as an afterthought. Her character often shows ambivalence, but does best when it turns into conviction.<br/><br/>So there is a lot of good film material in here, but just not the masterpiece it could have been for me for these reasons. Perhaps the editing by best of class Joe Walker did not present the story in the right way for me either. I will even try another viewing eventually, but I can only hope Blade Runner 2049 who should be about done filming now in Fall (with Roger Deakins who was missing in this project!! - no offence to young and gifted Bradford Young) delivers more punch next year. <br/><br/>In the meantime, Zemeckis' Allied (2016) comes out next week which could be riveting drama and Star Wars: Rogue One (2016) hits theatres next month for more sci-fi. Happy November!"
"ElPresidenteObamame","7","0","6","16 November 2016"," Good and bad
","So this movie seems to be about language. Yep, good old talking and writing. Basically its saying language is how we perceive and describe everything that happens to us in our world so language is how we will perceive higher dimensions like time fully. The movie makes a point to say that this is much more important than math. So much more important that when the arrivals give humanity their gift, that gift isn't some math equation, nope, it's their language... And through learning the arrival's language humans can then open themselves up to discovering all the other things they want to know, like how to travel faster than light. So there you have it, a movie that at the end of the day is all about talking and writing. I think they made this movie to try and get people everywhere to respect language more, and to respect what they say to each other more. When we speak we are doing more than just saying what is on our minds, we are interacting with another, and we wouldn't interact with another while waving a knife or gun around in their faces. So its important to raise our understanding of language to know that we can't just go around blasting the world with every though that enters our minds, we need to consider the effect and power of our words on others and adjust how we speak accordingly. That's what the movie is saying, personally I believe in honesty. If someone hates me, I want to know, so I can kill them first. Just IMHO."

","I really wanted to see this when I learned that it was directed by Denis Villeneuve, the same director of 'Prisoners' and (one of my favourite films of 2015) 'Sicario'.<br/><br/>This is not a typical sci-fi alien invasion film, more a thought provoking suspense drama with a surprising amount of emotion, especially at the beginning. In the opening scene we see Amie's character suffer the death of her daughter through cancer, so the audience are immediately made to feel sympathetic and on her side.<br/><br/>The basic story behind this deliberately slow burning film is the first encounter between aliens and humanity. 12 alien space craft appear at 12 random landing sites around the Earth, sparking a global crisis. The world leaders (initially) work together to determine the reason for the alien visit.<br/><br/>We discover that the aliens will need humanities help in 3000 years. In order for humanity to help them in the future we must first be able to understand them.<br/><br/>Amy Adams' character (a linguistics expert) and Jeremy Renner's character (a scientist) are brought in to try and communicate with the aliens. They need to make several attempts before they eventually crack the alien's 'inky' circles that they use to communicate.<br/><br/>The aliens give Amy the 'gift' of knowing the future, we realise the numerous flash-back scenes are actually flash-forward scenes. It becomes apparent that Amie's character already knows of the death of her daughter, but she also knows there is nothing she can do to change anything and this really makes her appreciate the present. <br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing, the music score is well constructed, strong in places and sensitive in others.<br/><br/>Amy Adams gives another fantastic performance. The only downer for me was the Jeremy Renner character, who was probably miss-cast and a little bland for me.<br/><br/>Not the usual Michael Bay style invasion shoot-m-up film and definitely worth a view."

Still the movie in my opinion nothing excellent still entertains as it challenges the mind of the viewer the questions of space, man, and life and how it interacts with the globe and other forms of life.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple an odd mystery type of spacecraft touches the globe and all of a sudden the military community wants answers is the universe on verge of a global war?
