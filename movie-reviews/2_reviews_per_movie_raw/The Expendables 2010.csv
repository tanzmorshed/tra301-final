"MR_Heraclius","6","38","41","23 February 2020"," I enjoyed this movie
","A novelty film, the novelty being seeing all of these great action stars together in one big action film. Unfortunately, most of them are past their prime, and it's hard to share the spotlight. The action is great, but it just isn't enough to carry the film this time. The characters and plot just aren't developed enough."

","I laugh at many of the hate comments as what the hell did they expect? a romantic comedy? award winning performances? deep dialogues? Freudian complex character study? <br/><br/>common give me a break!!! from the start you should know this is all about guns,explosives and one liners from start to finish and homage to silly 80's and 90's action flicks. and this is simply exactly what you get!!<br/><br/>while i will never understand what most woman think so great about sex and the city( fashion? shoes? what the hell?)<br/><br/>so this is for men/boys who will be thrilled to see their old heroes from back in the days once more on screen kicking everybody's ass! (and no, i can appreciate intellectual and deep movies, but it often simply comes down with having the right expectations)"
"TheCinemassacre","Null","332","494","13 August 2010"," Too much testosterone!
","Tough guys. Always going on suicidal missions. Threatened by bullets and blades. Running from explosions. Best friends waging wars. Nearly killing each other, then going to the bar later to laugh about it. Director and star, Sylvester Stallone, gets all his best men together to kick as much ass as humanly possible, allowing himself a severe beating from Steve Austin. Sly took a serious neck injury. Then he goes in front of a Comic Con audience and jokes about it. A man whose Double-""R"" franchises, Rocky and Rambo have both been highly successful. But he keeps coming back for more pain and putting his body on the line for the sake of entertainment. There's nothing tougher than that!<br/><br/>The Expendables is a movie that lifts you up out of your seat, pats you on the head, gives you a lollipop then smashes you in the frickin' face! With a cast like Jason Stathum, Randy Couture, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Terry Crews, Dolph ""I Must Break You"" Lundgren, and cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, you'd think it would be one crazy mess. Surprisingly, it's more focused then you may think. Just a straight-forward action movie with a reasonable run time that sustains itself and never has a chance to feel dull. It doesn't try to be anything more than what it is.<br/><br/>The only negative: Some of the blood and explosions looked digital. Wish it could have been just a bit more authentic. Sometimes, there was a tad too many closeups during the fight scenes. With so many people fighting at the same time, sometimes I couldn't tell who was punching who. It didn't happen very often, but how cool would it be just for one moment to see three simultaneous fights from a super wide master shot? Never, but I can't blame them. At least let the cameras pull back and allow the choreography to do the work.<br/><br/>It feels nice to get my ass kicked by something I haven't seen yet. It's not Rambo. It's not Rocky. Nor is it another Die Hard or Terminator sequel. It's something fresh, yet feels like it came out of the 80's. It has the perfect blend of humor, blood, sweat, smart-ass comebacks, witty one-liners, and an overabundance of testosterone! Don't expect anything more than action, exposition, action, exposition, all with a nice cherry on top with sprinkles and grenades. And some real tough guys. We all wish we could be tough guys. But no, let's just watch'em instead."

","So I guess with any film review - it's all about the answers to the important questions. So let's get them out of the way first shall we?<br/><br/>Q) Is the plot descent, with a substantial storyline including dramatic arcs, twists and/or turns?<br/><br/>A) Not particularly.<br/><br/>Q) Are there character arcs and meaningful character developments?<br/><br/>A) A little.<br/><br/>Q) Is there romance?<br/><br/>A) Next question, please.<br/><br/>Q) Is the overall film original?<br/><br/>A) Not at all.<br/><br/>Q) Is it a likely Oscar nomination contender?<br/><br/>A) Hell no!<br/><br/>Q) Is it still awesome?<br/><br/>A) HELL YES!!!!!<br/><br/>Critics should be banned from reviewing films such as these. Anyone with half a brain can tell exactly what kind of film this is and what they're in for purely by the film's trailer alone.<br/><br/>This is a film made for action movie fans and not just regular action movies - I mean REAL action films in the style of the classic 80's action movies where plot and substantial character developments and dialogue took a backseat to intense over-the-top violence, explosions, car chases, sex scenes and catchy, memorable one liners!<br/><br/>The 80's action hero (and villain) breed was a rare phenomenon which will likely die with those very actors who gave them life. No 90's or new millennium ""action"" movie star will ever come close to being anywhere near as genuinely tough and just plain bad-arse as their 80's predecessor's! Even now with the main 'Expendables' cast pushing 60 +, you know that they would snap Matt Damon's spine in 2 with one hand tied behind their backs!<br/><br/>The 'Expendables' cast consists of Sly Stallone as the fearless leader of the team, Jason (Basketball stabber) Statham as the trusty knife-throwing sidekick, Dolph Lundgren as the treacherous giant one, Jet-Li as the small one, Terry Chews as Wesley Snipes, Mickey Rourke as the tattoo/previous knife-throwing sidekick and Randy Couter as the ""who the hell is this guy, oh he's a UFC fighter"" guy.<br/><br/>I still can't believe the unbelievable shape these guys are in! They're giants (exception for Jet-li of course).<br/><br/>Still, despite it's 80's throw-back appeal - the film isn't all action. Believe it or not there are slow parts. Mostly unnecessary filler between the action scenes. However the third act of the film makes up for the lack of action and then some!<br/><br/>It's when this third act commences when the true action film we've been waiting to see kicks in and steps up several notches to become the manliest most testosterone-fueled film since the last 'Rambo'!<br/><br/>It's funny, it's loud, it's un-relentlessly violent, an action-packed no-brainer of a film! An 80's action movie fan's wet-dream!!!<br/><br/>Bring on the sequel/s and bring on Jean-Claude Van Damme so he can give Statham the butt-kicking he so desperately deserves!!!"
"andrew-don","2","273","433","15 August 2010"," Bad, and not bad in a good way, just bad.
","Straight up, I am the biggest fan of the 80s action films ever. I loved Commando, Predator, Rambo, Rocky, Die Hard, Kickboxer etc etc etc.<br/><br/>What have they done? This film had all the potential to be huge, but they killed it with terrible writing. I can handle plot holes, in fact a movie like this almost needs them. But there is no excuse for such poor dialogue. Where are the cool lines? I expected to come out quoting a whole heap of new one liners, instead we get stupid jokes about 'wanting to be president'. The scene with Bruce Willis, Sly and Arnie should have been awesome, instead it felt like there was some in-joke between them that we didn't know about. It was like being at a party listening to 3 people you don't know talking about something you don't understand! Dolph Lundgren was the best part of the film, and they didn't give him enough to do. Why is this man not starring in A grade blockbusters? The big rapid fire shotgun offered some humorous moments, though I don't know if this was deliberate or not. Considering this was supposed to be about the action, it was very poorly shot. Ever since Gladiator it seems directors are intent on making us feel part of the fight. Screw that, I don't want to be in it, I want to see what's happening. Why bother having Jet Li, Randy Cotour and Stone Cold in a film if all you can see of them is arms and legs flailing at close range? Watch any old Jackie Chan flick, or even the old Stallone and Schwarzeneggar movies, the action shots are wide enough that you can actually see what they are doing.<br/><br/>Very disappointing"
"yellowbuket101","8","403","660","4 August 2010"," They don't get much more explosive than this!
","The expectation for this film is obviously very high with one of the best action hero line ups (if not the best) in cinematic history. So I went into this film with a little trepidation and a lot of anticipation. I can honestly say that I was not disappointed. This was a high octane, unbelievably explosive, funny, blood thirsty, proper action movie! This film would not have been out of place in the 80s, but manages to fit into the market of today's cinematic action experience. It is easily much more graphic and gory than most modern day action films, but this adds to the film and creates a degree of realism. Let's face it; if you go around killing people it isn't going to be pretty! This film did what it needed to do, it wasn't afraid to contain blood, guts and violence for the sake of an age restriction but also wasn't overly ridiculous. After all most of the people who will watch this film grew up watching the classic action films of the 80s and 90s and are old enough for a bit of gore.<br/><br/>The plot is not that original, but it doesn't need to be, nor was it expected to be. The cast, goes without saying, was fantastic. What could have been a disaster of conflicting egos ended up being a believable team of mercenaries where banter is rife and keeping each other alive is their number one priority. Stallone can give himself a big pat on the back for getting so many iconic actors onto the screen together and actually making it work. Though the much hyped cameo of two particular people was short lived, it was hilarious and I think a great moment in cinema.<br/><br/>This was a great film that keeps you glued to your seat, constantly makes you gasp and laugh out loud and leaves you pumping with adrenaline. It was ridiculous and wonderful all at the same time, with more bullets and bombs than Rambo and more fighting than Rocky. This is a must see film for any movie buff or action hero wannabe. It is certainly not for the faint hearted, or for kids, but for any true action movie lover this is the ultimate manly film.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone, NICE JOB!"
"npg-4","1","219","363","19 August 2010"," The title says it all
","Bunch of sweaty blokes try to out-macho each other. The heroine is tortured, then dragged through bullets, raging fires and explosions as the whole set is blown up, yet emerges unscathed with perfect hairdo. Pointless appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Missed all opportunities for some decent jokes, and had to repeat an average one just in case we missed it. Unlikeable one-dimensional characters, predictable plot, no twists and not an ounce of suspense. I found nothing to like about this film, and would have walked out if I had woken up. Expendable plot, expendable dialogue, expendable characters ... I could go on interminably, like the film does."
"Big_River","6","25","35","7 September 2012"," Predictable.
","A typical action movie that checks all of the action movie boxes. Lots of explosions, shootings, killings and unrealistic fight scenes. <br/><br/>It's great to see all of the dinosaurs from the 80's team up with each other. Stallone looked convincing as the main guy but it's the youth of Jason Statham that delivers the adrenalin in this movie. I would've liked to have seen more from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Their roles were far too short for the amount of action experience they have. Steve Austin is the only person that was miscast. Personally, I think that this movie would have been better without him. <br/><br/>I got what I expected and if you like action movies...you will definitely like ""The Expendables""."
"tw12345","1","207","347","20 August 2010"," Just Garbage
","Really. Like many other reviewers, I had high hopes for this movie. I thought it would be in the tradition of Space Cowboys, the old pros come back for one more shot at the bad guys. But it quickly just degraded into typical shoot-em-up crap. Spoiler: The scene with Schwarzenegger is a complete rip-off - about a minute long, no action, has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>About 65% of the movie is people fighting or shooting at each other or blowing things up, and it really did just get boring. The execution wasn't even that good - fight scenes had obviously sped-up footage that looked like those old dinosaur movies, sound effects were bad (every punch had the same fake thud), and the characters looked like they were in pain - not from the bullets which never touched them, but from the awful plot. Poor Jet Li complained the whole way through that he wasn't getting enough money - he was practically begging to be let out of his contract go so he could go work on something better - even a commercial.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke was good but didn't have much of a part, or any purpose for being there. Also that 250-round per minute shotgun thing, going boom-boom-boom, was funny every time. But not worth the 9 bucks and two hours of sitting through another ridiculous re-hashing of the rogue-CIA-guy and ""small band of mercenaries invades and overruns tiny central American dictatorship"" story.<br/><br/>I was expecting a good poignant aging-action-hero movie, or maybe a comedy, but this was just laughably bad. It's baffling how this could be the number 1 movie, unless a lot of people were sucked in by the hype, like I was. Also the 7-point-something rating on IMDb has got to be inflated - rottentomatoes gives it a 42% which is more like it.<br/><br/>When I heard that Seagal and Van Damme turned down roles in this film, I thought it was because they were too full of themselves. But now I realize it's because they knew it was crap."
"vintagemovies","2","133","222","19 August 2010"," the unflushables
","This is the worst mainstream big budget movie I've ever seen. <br/><br/>The claim that the film stars Schwarzenegger and Willis are totally dishonest. They appear for a minute in a very boring scene.<br/><br/>The script is pathetic, there isn't a single decent one liner,the editing is awful, the acting is so bad that Gary Daniels steals every scene he is in and how the hell Lundgren gets killed by Stallone early on when he's a baddie and reappears as a goodie at the end baffles AND bores me. The claims of wall to wall action are also lies: it's over half an hour till we get the first action scene- a routine car chase that is below par for the a-team- the 80's series not the recent movie.<br/><br/>The fight between Lundgren and Jet Li could have been a standout but its too dark and incoherently edited.<br/><br/>Pathetic. Avoid."
"stuart-wanta","1","152","263","13 August 2010"," What Did I Just Watch?
","When I purchased my $9 movie ticket this evening I thought I would be watching an action version of Ocean's 11. Instead, I was subjected to what can only be described as the sequel to ""88 Minutes."" This movie was god awful. I understand that value of this movie is derived from it's action sequences and not the storyline, but even those sucked. Can someone explain to me why 12 armed soldiers play quick feet around two unarmed men and just wait for them to beat them up instead of just pulling the trigger? Also, why does Stallone run like a marionette? Was there a reason Randy Couture felt the need to punch a burning Steve Austin? Lets be honest, the fire was getting the job done.<br/><br/>It's quite clear that Stallone is going through a mid-life crisis type deal and felt the need to get himself back on the screen. He and Statham were the only ones with more than 5 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>I didn't expect Schindler's List, but I also didn't expect to leave the theater with the taste of urine in my mouth. If you haven't seen it yet, wait for the DVD."
"cybopath","10","203","358","15 August 2010"," Stallone does it again!
","After nearly a decade of disappointments Stallone shocked the movie world by making a 6th emotionally charged Rocky, he then went on to please fans by taking Rambo into a visceral brutally realistic war movie, now for his hat trick Stallone gave us something old and something new 'The Expendables' the type of movie kids dreamed about the early 90's, what if this guy & that guy and him where all in a film together. A little too late? Hell no! Never has this film been more needed. In a land of watered down PG-13 wire work action movies real action fans where desperate for some real old school action. (Cobra, Commando, Delta Force, Last Boy Scout..) The great thing about this film is even if it didn't have the cast it still would be a great action movie, the fact it has such a jaw dropping cast just makes it all the better. Stallone is growing as an action director, he brought some of his tense brutal techniques from Rambo but was smart enough to go a little old school for other scenes. Their are some very kinetic action sequences but not Parkinson's suffering cameraman techniques like the Bourn films.<br/><br/>The main focus of the team are Stallone & Statham, they really have a good Old Dog, New Dog friendship. Lundgren (My favourite character) gets a an interesting sub plot. Unfortunately Li, Couture & Crews get pushed to the background but they do get some great scenes to shine. (Hopefully they can get some more development in the sequel.<br/><br/>Roberts and his Henchman Stone Cold Steve Austin shine as the brutal villains. Gary Danials however was really underused I was expecting some Bennet style lines. At least he got one of the best fights of the movies.<br/><br/>Of coarse the scene everyone was talking about was the Stallone, Schwarzenegger & Willis scene. Which was one of the funniest parts of the movie. Their attempt to put each other down while out manning each other worked brilliantly and Willis threatening Stallone alone is worth the ticket price.<br/><br/>A slight nag about the film is at the very end some CGI did crop up, in the form of fire. After all the practical stunts throughout the movie including one great Truck chase I was a little disappointed not to see a stuntman in a fire suit.<br/><br/>If this had just been Stallone's baby with a few unknown actors I'd give this film 8/10 BUT the fact we get to see Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Crews, Roberts, Rourke, Danials with Willis & Schwarzenegger punch, kick, stab, mouth off and blow up each other cranks it up to a 9.5/10 for me.<br/><br/>Bring on Expendables II"
"thesar-2","1","81","137","21 August 2010"," The 'D-' Team
","Sure, Sylvester Stallone isn't the most bankable star. He's washed up and knows it. I appreciate that he knows, though writing and directing that theory into an incredibly shallow, talentless and pointless movie containing characters with zero depth or chemistry between each other and bringing other D-List stars down with himis just plain wrong.<br/><br/>The Expendables didn't have much going for it, except for taking the Freddy Vs. Jason idea to a whole new level. Not a better level, but just expanding the cast of has-beens. So, I guess the only way for the film to go is up, upon viewing? NO. It started low and got worse.<br/><br/>The action was so few and far between that when you finally got to one of the few scenes, though they were decent, you're left so bored, it's hard to remember at that time this is, in fact, an action flick. It's a no-brainer that the cast basically has no brains left, so the expectations of them suddenly performing Hamlet was null. Yet, I really wanted to see something, anything out of them. Not only was each one, bypassing Jason Statham as Lee Christmas who stood far above EVERY other individual, so dull, boring, one-note, incredibly UNFUNNY with jokes and one-liners seen from a neighboring county, but not one had an ounce of chemistry with each other. It's as if Mr. Stallone asked them, not that they need a reason to get their first paycheck in years, and they signed on without so much as seeing the script.<br/><br/>And speaking of which, was there a script? We have the lesser of A-Team movies this summer where as an elite group of highly trained mercenaries who are hired for a job, but surprise! There's now more at stake as there's a completely thrown in (only for the sake of having the clichéd) love interest, one of their own that might be betraying them (oh, drat!) and the target might be harder than they anticipated: An Evil Drug Lord – oh, no! – who controls both his island's people and government.<br/><br/>Sure, this is a throwback to the same types of movies this 100+ actor group is used to back in the 1980s, and as much as most of those are corny, stereotypical, low-rent and shallow, at least they had heart. At least they didn't lie to what they were. You knew what you were getting yourself into.<br/><br/>Here, in The Expendables, Director Stallone yearns to make a serious movie about senior citizens kicking butt by adding male-bonding, a philosophical tattoo preacher and the importance of friendship and trust. Then he switches back to the Predator-days long gone with jungles, blood, guts, guns and not-so-snappy one-liners.<br/><br/>Don't get me started – too late – on the cameos. I understand the big Arnold Schwarzenegger had some forest fire business in his own country of California, but his, Bruce Willis's and Sly's scenes went as well together as their ownership of Planet Hollywood restaurants. Each one was all but a head shot where you couldn't even tell they were in the same room, not to mention it lasted all but 5 minutes. I had the same problem with the movie Heat; FINALLY they got Pacino and De Niro on the same screen for, what?, 5 minutes!?! And furthermore, I hate the post-Terminating Smiling-Jack Schwarzenegger and his cornball dumbass lines. Even the ones thrown at him were so foreseen, they weren't funny.<br/><br/>The rest of the walk-ons, including the washed-up-before-Wrestler-and-back-to-third-rate-following, Rourke, were just happy to be employed. I guess the recession runs deeper than they thought – back to the 80s! Despite my one star review, there were two good scenes, I'll admit: Christmas, wait – wow, really Stallone? That's the best you can come up with for an ACTION star's name? Hope you didn't take that from Dr. Christmas Jones from The World is Not Enough. Anyways, Tough Christmas takes on thugs on a basketball court due to one of the failed side plots involving his love interest. I always like seeing Statham fight, despite the poor quality of the film he's in. Also, the climax is quite unbelievable, of course, but you cant rate that down for the movie it is. I will say, though, before the 700 explosions in the finale, there was a little cave fight scene that ended with machine gun/human slicing excitement. Literally, I was dozing off until that happened – multiple and honestly well choreographed fighters took on the enemy.<br/><br/>Those two scenes by FAR could not save the rest of this crap. I'd say maaaaybe rent it for the aforementioned scenes and the testosterone finale – at least you can select those chapters and not be hopelessly stuck in the theater. Even when Stallone was bad in his career, he never stooped this low. SKIP!"
"michael-wolman","3","81","137","20 August 2010"," The Movie that Cannot be Unmade
","I have to give fair warning, I didn't like this movie and I am officially sending up the flag of SPOILER ALERT. If anyone holds me responsible for giving away key elements to the movie plot I am legally not liable. On second thought, if you hold me responsible for ruining this film because I am giving away pieces of the plot have no fear, the movie would have ruined itself for you had you simply seen the movie with no idea of what to expect. Please trust me, the book is no better than the film.<br/><br/>I will start my more rant with Mickey Rourke. I like Mickey, truly I do. I think Barfly was great, and so was the Wrestler, and Sin Cityand I respect his undefeated boxing record. I will argue that he was the only redeemable quality in Iron Man 2 and he was even good in this movie. I think that's why I wish he would have stayed out. Rourke's appearance was an exact duplication of his appearance in Iron Man 2. He had the unusual white streaks in his hair and gold teeth. It led me believe that he preformed his parts in between shooting on his other movie. Rourke played the steady hand and I got the feeling that he had to descend to the skill set of a much weaker cast. Just because he was dressed like a post apocalyptic cowboy doesn't mean he didn't carry every scene he was in.<br/><br/>My next victim is a Three Stooges style double slap to Steve Austin and Randy Couture. I am beginning to think that these two actors are kisses of death for any movie. Case in point, Scorpion King 2 and the Longest Yard. Perhaps I am giving these two individuals too much credit for breaking something that was never fixed. They were clearly added for one reason, to cross over in their main occupation's demographic. I know I am not being prophetic here, but there is something truly Rotten in Denmark when two stars of a movie have nicknames (the Natural and Stone Cold) in the movie moniker. Did they bring a level of intensity and action to the movie? Well perhaps to the trailer, but the movie suffered from their inability to articulate the strong emotional responses they were feeling. It would have been more reasonable to see them just replace all their lines with 'smash' and 'break'.<br/><br/>Couture was given the artistic liberty to have a scene where he explains his cauliflower ears. I have to say that this scene got chuckles from the audience and I had to look away as the thought of one hundred strangers laughing at a man is too ugly for me to bear. There were other scenes where the camera was perhaps a little too close to Couture and the bulbs and lumps covering his face and head were magnified. He is a hideous looking individual when not in the context of MMA.<br/><br/>Lundgren, at some point in this jigsaw puzzle of a plot, was to be believed to have a heroin problem. Or was it a heroine problem? If Hunter Thompson has taught me anything it's that you can trust a man but not a drug, especially if that drug is armed to the teeth. I have a very difficult time believing that the 6' 13'', 297-pound blonde was any sort of opiate junkie and that the drug would make him more violent. I am not a licensed drug councilor though so I will defer my judgment to those that know the ins and outs of addiction.<br/><br/>I knew the action and movement would be fast paced but I had no idea that the vertigo would be magnified due to the unusual camera movement thought any action scene. In any scene where there was violence, tension, speed or blinking the camera was shaking as if in a 7.2 magnitude earthquake. I have been told that it was to give the feeling of movement and chaos, but it only gave me the feeling that there was too much pressure in my brain and that I shouldn't take the floor for granted. Please be advised, if you are planning on taking anyone to this film with a medical condition that has symptoms of vertigo or nausea they may need to leave.<br/><br/>As the movie progressed I got he feeling more and more that the plot was revised along the way and that the glaring inconsistencies were simply swatted away by the director. Perhaps he thought that the Neanderthal that planned on seeing the film wouldn't notice or care to notice. Perhaps there is no such thing as the super charged testosterone driven question mark (?).<br/><br/>When my son comes and asks me who was great in the action film genre in the 20th century I'll explain that Stallone was a great goon, and Arnold was a Robot, and Statham was a transporter, and that Couture was this great Greco-Roman wrestler. I know my heart will absolutely bottom out when he informs me that, 'If all these action stars were so great, why were the all in such a bad movie?' I tear up when I think about how this film has tarnished the catalog of so many great action heroes. Will I ever be able to say 'Yippie-ki-yea mother f@#$er' again? Will I ever notice the great Wu Shu in Fearless? Will Old Spice no longer smell as sweet? <br/><br/>Van Dam turned this movie down. Yeah, Bloodsport didn't think it had any substance. Why was this so difficult to see by everyone else? This reminds me of the Jones/Hopkins fight from April of this year. It was a fight everyone was itching to see a decade ago. We all still watched the highly criticized bout, but it was well past it's prime. Unfortunately this film did not age well, and what has been made can't be unmade."
"D_Burke","8","176","313","9 August 2010"," ""Expendables"" Reminds Us Why We Will Watch Sylvester Stallone
","""The Expendables"" is without question the most anticipated movie of the summer of 2010. Its cast is a who's who of established action film stars of the previous three decades. Even though the previews gave away the cameo by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, it still gave us just another reason to stand in line for this movie.<br/><br/>And who else leads the impressive roster of stars but the American dream himself, Sylvester Stallone, who also co-wrote and directed this movie himself. Stallone is one of those rare movie stars who, even in that period of time (circa 1998-2005) when he wasn't making many films, you never heard him referred to as a B-lister or a has-been. It could be because he has arguably had more career comebacks than any actor in history.<br/><br/>Don't call ""The Expendables"" a comeback, though. If anything, it's a further reminder that Stallone can still make engrossing films that defy target audience groups. Oh yeah, and he looks better than any 64-year-old I know of.<br/><br/>Although Stallone wears three heavy hats in this movie, he doesn't carry the weight of the movie on his own shoulders. You've already read the names of the action stars who support him here. Although the youngest of the Expendables (Jason Statham) is 37, they are far from a rag-tag crew. This movie shows that they can still kick more ass than ""Kick- Ass"" (2010).<br/><br/>The Expendables describes a team of what could be considered mercenaries, or bounty hunters. They go on high-risk missions, guns in hand, and pick up the money owed to them at the end of the day. Their main mission in this movie is initially to overthrow a South American dictator in the fictional nation of Vilena. Eventually, they find that the real enemy is ex-CIA agent James Munroe (Eric Roberts) aided by ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and a whole army of guerrilla soldiers.<br/><br/>This movie is full of action sequences, all of which are fun to watch. There are also some scenes involving knives (particularly ones thrown by Jason Statham) that even made me flinch. Although there are plenty of scenes involving knives and big guns, there are some great sequences involving hand-to-hand combat. You definitely don't want to take a bathroom break when 5'6 Jet Li takes on 6'4 Dolph Lundgren. There's also a fight scene between Steve Austin and Randy Couture that will satisfy both UFC and WWE fans.<br/><br/>These scenes were not without their confusion, though, especially those shot using what appeared to be a hand-held camera. There were a lot of close-up shots during these intense parts that didn't seem necessary, and the way the camera shook and almost too quickly cut to another scene was confusing. Ang Lee used similar camera tricks in his version of ""Hulk"", and they bewildered more than entranced. <br/><br/>A thinking man's movie it is not, that's for sure, but it is still a fun movie that needs to be seen on the big screen. Plus, with all the testosterone in it, it may have been difficult for a woman to stand out. Although she didn't have any weapons or fighting power, Giselle Itie was hardly a damsel in distress.

You'll know it when you see it.<br/><br/>""The Expendables"" will not disappoint action fans. It also is not short of quotable lines, especially in Gov. Schwarzenegger's cameo. Expendable, by definition, means considered to be not worth keeping or maintaining, but the careers of everyone involved in this film remain quite the opposite."

","Get ready to cheer. Be ready to laugh. Be ready to be amazed with wonderful, live action fighting scenes using everything from fists, to blades, to guns. I don't know how this movie avoided being cheesy, but darn it, it did! Mindless explosions? Not really. Excessive? Again, not really. I hate the sort of climax usually seen in an action movie where the pyrotechnics are the show. I want to see the actors/stunt-men doing their thing. I want to see people. I can see fireworks on the Fourth of July. (Though, trust me, there ARE fireworks in this movie, too.) The balancing of this many stars is incredible and pulled off remarkably well. When Sylvester Stallone made his final Rocky movie (Rocky Balboa), he said he did it as a ""thank you"" to the fans. Maybe that was the idea behind this one, too, though I heard a quote from somewhere that after seeing wimpy Tobey Maguire as ""Spiderman"" full of CGI and a stuffed/padded suit, he realized action heroes like himself were, well, expendable.<br/><br/>This is fantasy baseball and fantasy rock-n-roll camp for adults all rolled into a wonderful action flick with enough of a plot to give the characters motivation for their action. A deep plot? Heck no. A predictable plot? Certainly. But trust me, if you thought you've seen it all before, you have yet to see ""The Expendables."" Thank you Mr. Stallone!"

Barney and Lee, a knife enthusiast, meet the rebel Sandra and discover what is really happening behind the conflict in the city. Sandra is revealed to be the dictator's daughter, and during an ambush, they need to scape and let Sandra behind. But Ross cannot let Sandra there, and to make peace with his conscience, he and his team decide to go back to the Island.<br/><br/>'The Expendables' is not a great masterpiece of the action movies but is not a terrible movie either; to be honest, as many users here already wrote, the movie is very ' so so'. I could say the movie is 'satisfying', if I need to use a word. Being honest, I was hoping for more, specially because all of the propaganda saying it would be the 'Greatest Action Film Ever', and also with the reunion of great names like Bruce Wilis,Schwarzenegger, Jet Li,Dolph Lundgren,etc. One of the most disappointing things in my opinion, was the fact that Arnold and Bruce were on the screen only to do a cameo appearance. A very funny cameo appearance, but still a cameo appearance. I thought Arnold and Bruce would be kicking asses with everybody, but in fact the movie centers around Stallone, Lundgren, and Statham's characters practically.<br/><br/>There are some cool explosions and some nice fighting scenes, for sure, but the plot is weak and cliché, and no matter how many bombs they can explode, an ordinary plot doesn't make a movie something incredible. <br/><br/>To make a small summary of what I am talking about: The movie is worthwhile because of the reunion of great legends of the action movies, but are better action films out there for sure. I would say for people to watch this movie, but with few expectations."

First Sylvester Stallone and Jason statham go there to look at the island. generals daughter helps them see over the place.There they are seen by some people and there is a fighting . We see good action there. and i really liked the action there. But after coming back the old Stallone starts dreaming about generals daughter. And goes back with his friends to rescue her.There after it is a rubbish movie.A person runs amidst thousand bullets , and none touches him. A hero is in trouble, and out of no where his friends come to rescue him. Ultimately the put afire the whole island, and no one gets a single bruise. Even the girl does not come with Stallone. Altogether a mind less action movie, whose action is of the lowest category, which you can only find in Stallone movies."

","Sylvester Stallone is a legend, no two options on that! He is one of my favorite stars, I was crazy about him in his 'Rambo' days. As a fan, I expected a lot of entertainment from his latest flick 'The Expendables'. The film stars each and every Action Star, apart from Van Damme and Jackie Chan. It's obvious you'd except outstanding entertainment & bad-ass action from this one, right? Sadly, I got not even half of the entertainment I had expected.<br/><br/>About a team of mercenaries head to South America on a mission to overthrow a dictator. Sly the writer, brings down Sly the director as well. 'The Expendables' begins with a bang, but loses the grip 30-minutes into the film. In fact, the story just doesn't move. For example, Dolph Lundgren's track, it contributes nothing to film. But yet it is given a start, middle & end. Also, Jason Statham's romantic track is a yawn. It looks out of place! But, the climax is superb. It's explosive Action, and lives up to the genre of the film.<br/><br/>One expected much more from Sly. His writing is not sharp. His direction, due to a poor screenplay, is average. Even the scene between Sly-Arnie-Willis fails to make an impact. Jeffrey Kimball's Cinematography is fine. Editing by, Ken Blackwell & Paul Harb lacks fin-ace.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Sly, the actor, is surely in form. But the show-stealer, is undoubtedly, Mickey Rourke. The veteran is remarkable in a cameo appearance. The scene where he recalls his past, his expressions, his dialouge delivery, is simply awesome. In fact, it's the most effective scene in the entire film. Jason Statham is just right. Jet Li is fair. Dolph Lundgren doesn't work, mainly due to amateur characterization. Randy Couture is okay. Eric Roberts hams. Steve Austin is able. Charisma Carpenter, looks angelic in a small role.<br/><br/>On the whole, A must watch only for Sly's devotees. Otherwise, catch this directly on DVD!"

","I must admit that when I first saw trailers for this film I was extremely optimistic. I felt that any movie with such an abundance of action star-power had all the makings of a home run popcorn flick. Although I'm not much a fan of watching the nearly seventy-year old Sylvester Stallone act on screen, I still remained hopeful because of the film being graced with the presence of the ever-talent Mickey Rourke, and extremely exciting fight sequences with Jason Statham. The movie open almost immediately with gun-a-blazing. These scenes were far from impressive and the worst part is that the opening scene defines the film as a whole. One could have simply put this scene on replay for 100 plus minutes and ended up with the same results. A huge criticism about this film that seems almost unanimous by those who have given it a negative review is that there is ""too much testosterone"". Although there is no doubt that testosterone flows through this film like the Nile river, it was not the problem for this film. After watching the film, I realized that it was the perfect equation for how to not make a movie. It was a mixture of bad dialog, bad special effects, and bad acting (except for Mickey Rourke and Jason Statham). The dialog is meaningless through out the entire film and really presents no way for the different characters to connect with the audience. The most disappointing part of the film however was the horrendous special effects, which climax at the end of the film after one of the villains is shot to pieces and then has an enormous, Rambo-esquire knife fly through his chest which really solidified this film as being an overpriced, straight-to-DVD movie."

His running looked laboured and it didn't look like he would in anyway catch the plane but he did and it looked awful... the rest wasn't so bad most of the action they were involved in was in cars etc so they didn't have to labour too hard. <br/><br/>now for the mindless action... I couldn't understand the dialogue... Sly Stallone being the worst offender... He can barely string a sentence together in his prime and in this Movie he is totally unintelligible... with all this CGI they could make his speech clearer i think, or at least give him subtitles.. it totally ruined what should have been a mindless movie for me as i had to concentrate too hard on what he was saying to sit back and be mindless..."

","I remember the time when I first saw the announcement for this movie. Great crew, the best there is, what could possibly go wrong? The expectations were very high, but this turns out to be just another cheap ""America saves the day"" pattern. <br/><br/>Now, where should I start? Crew: Bunch of old men who wants to look younger at any price. Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Lundgren, Roberts, Rourke... They should simply go to history and remain what they presently are- the stars that we were growing up with instead making fun of themselves trying to pump some muscles at the age of 60+. They look ridiculous and I am being gentle in my criticism. <br/><br/>The special effects are awful. I do no know the budget limit that this movie had, but that stupid scenes when Stallone jumps into moving plane (!?) or Statham shoots from the same plane at the docs, they look like they were filmed 20-30 years ago. <br/><br/>The storyline is awful. Schwarzenegger has one minute roll, practically as some stunt, but I guess they needed his name for the commercial. Brus Willis as well- he is there to hire them and not a single word from him to the end of the movie. Lundgren is a psychopath who tries to kill them all and, at the end, he is a good guy and they are drinking beer all together. And Stallone is going to attack whole sovereign state all by himself because he wants to save one girl and redempt his soul that way?! Come on! I am sick and tired of the same old pattern where Americans are good guys and I am bored by their disrespect for the Eastern- Europe ex socialistic block and South America countries. For example, Rourke calls Serbian national drink sh** even it is a hundred times better and healthier than whiskey (In one interview from 04.05.2008. Rourke called himself a Serb and promised to visit Serbia!?). And if the CIA wasn't interfere in Bosnia, there wouldn't be any war in the first place. <br/><br/>This is where the problem is- the big movie stars are used to spread American propaganda over the world through shallow and insulting (for the ones intelligence) movies like this.<br/><br/>I am truly sorry about is the fact that Lee and Statham decided to take part in the most stupid project of the decade. <br/><br/>Justified killing in the name of America, one gun vs hundred automatic rifles, botox faces, awful scenario, poor lines, bad acting. Don't be fooled with rating- this grade is not proper measure of the movie quality. My advice: look at this movie and see for yourself how ridiculous, shallow, insulting and empty it really is."

"bob the moo","Null","10","15","18 November 2010"," Solid boys-own action but could have done with a few more thrills and a bit more in the way of comic relief
","With the cast it had it was no surprise that The Expendables was being hyped long before it arrived in cinemas anywhere. ""Could it be the greatest action movie ever?"" some magazines breathlessly asked themselves, assuming perhaps that the cast could somehow just produce a good film by virtue of all just being in it. The answer of course is ""no"" and I doubt anyone expected it to be any other answer. However the real question was can the film produce the boys-only, 1980's action movie fun that the 2010 summer season needed. The answer to this question turned out to be ""sort of"" because The Expendables has plenty to enjoy about it but yet somehow falls short of what it could have been.<br/><br/>The plot is essentially a small group of mercenaries heading into a tropical island in order to take out the dictator and his ex-CIA puppet-master: so far, so ""one man against endless ethnic army"" 80's style plotting. And indeed so it is, complete with unnecessary violence and overblown physical actions and seemingly indestructible heroes. It plays out just the way you expect it to do and those looking for action sequences will enjoy the many fights and scenes where everything blows up (Terry Crews in particular demonstrating to the world why Infinity Ward were out of their minds to make the AA-12 a ""secondary"" weapon in Modern Warfare 2!). The downside of the action is that, while it is enjoyable, it doesn't deliver enough of two key things.<br/><br/>The first of these is genuine thrills. It comes close and there are good moments but generally you find yourself sitting back watching the mayhem for the sake of mayhem, whereas I would prefer to be sucked into and really gripped by the action - I wasn't really here; instead most of the action is of the video game style – where the enemy just keeps spawning in front of you and getting chopped down by powerful weaponry. The second thing that isn't as prevalent as I wanted was comedy. We get the odd bit here and there, but really Jet Li's ""because I'm small"" speech is probably the high point. What was needed was more comedy mixed in with the action. There were a few kiss-off lines but nothing memorable or even ""good"". These are important because it makes the excess easier to enjoy as just part of a fun package – the film not having enough suspense or thrills makes the lack of this ""fun"" all the more obvious and notable of a gap.<br/><br/>The cast do help though and not just in terms of having big names in there. They do have an easy charisma between them and they all play off each other well – whether it be Stallone and Statham or the brief cameos from Willis and Swarzenegger. Crews isn't used particularly well but otherwise I liked everyone else in it, even if there were probably too many of them to really do much with – I thought it was a good move, despite appearing to be an ensemble piece, to put most of the focus on two of them rather than spreading it evenly around. Of course looking at it fairly, the film is not great – the plot is obvious and full of ""groan"" moments that we have to have simply because of the genre plus it is hard to shake the feeling that the film is more for the stars benefit than it is about the viewers, like perhaps they enjoyed it more than I did? Overall though The Expendables is a solid enough 80's style action movie that does everything you expect it to do but nothing more. Personally I preferred The Losers to this simply because it delivered action and comedy blended well to make for an enjoyably silly actioner, whereas this doesn't really do that and perhaps takes itself a little too seriously for its own good. A solid genre film and enjoyable as that, but it doesn't do enough to justify the sheer volume of big names in it."

Having got everyone together they just hang around not doing very much for way too long as if just getting them all in the same film was enough. Which means the film relies on story, writing and dialogue, and none of those are good. Too few funny lines, too few good scenes. Even Arnie's cameo is so what? Most of the first hour is sweaty guys badly photographed in dark locations. If you stick with it you get an okay last half hour, but it's just okay, not great.

It didn't make any sense.I went into this film ready to see giant battle sequences with every single member in the cast that the trailer perpetually advertised, but instead I was given low quality action,atrocious dialouge, and scenes that that simply felt half done.For example, the big cameo with Arnold and Stallone,felt over played and...quite frankly... really awkward, kinda like when you run into a old friend at a store and both of you just stand there with nothing to say.

","What a cast. Many of these A-list actors could fill cinemas on their own. Putting them all together in one movie should surely multiply its appeal and magic, something like a Dream Team? Predictably, it's not the case. Neither of those actors, some of whom my childhood movie heroes, get enough time to develop their characters on-screen. They're all empty shells of action heroes, one trying to be cooler than the other. Maybe just with Stallone and Statham playing off each other, this movie would've amounted to something more.<br/><br/>Today's coolness and manliness then, according to this movie, consists of riding motorbikes or hot rods and killing lots of bad people for money. I do not really agree. Going back to a benchmark of mine, The A-Team has shown that being cool doesn't depend on scenes of gory, meaningless killings. Yes, Rambo also killed a lot, but that was not as meaningless as this. There was some personal motivation and reason. Here, they piled on kill after kill, none of which have any impact.<br/><br/>With these actors, the plot should've been much more focused on hand-to-hand fights. Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, all their fighting abilities are criminally underused. And when there's a short fight scene with Jet Li for instance, they don't really use their own style (kung fu in this case), plus we get the usual bad ""american"" fight editing, using shaky cameras and extremely short cuts.<br/><br/>The humor is also badly limping. The plot is rather ridiculous (at one point i thought ""did they really just make up an island for this movie?"") and only a means to generate various unlikely scenes of violence. Don't get me wrong, i have nothing against violent movies, but this left me feeling empty and detached.<br/><br/>Too many cooks spoil the broth, never has this saying been more appropriate. Had this been a more focused attempt with two or three main characters, it might have worked better."
"SubZeroMK","10","14","24","11 September 2010"," This decades BEST action movie.
","2010, the last year of the Y2K generation or decade. 2011 is the start of a new age, a new generation and a new decade into film and everything else.<br/><br/>You're not supposed to go to this movie expecting to be moved by the story or for the story to make you think. You're supposed to go to this movie and think ""Yeah, I paid this much money to see a movie with kick-ass action and guns, I can't wait!"". Sylvester Stallone has been known to make action movies and have roles in more than he can count. But this movie delivers 100 levels of high-octane action. You film geeks and critics can't grasp that fact. You expect a story, something to make you think. Well this movie does that. Everyone who lived through the 80's and 90's can re-collect their memories of Rambo, Predator and movies alike that had balls to the wall action and enjoy the old glory days. But you critics are something else. You obviously don't know the audience this movie is sold to. But you see, this movie made people think. When I saw some of the most bad-ass action scenes I thought to myself, wow, words can not describe the joygasm I am having watching this. F****** BADASS!. F*** YEAH!. That's why it did so well in the box office, but again you critics cannot grasp that. In fact, why are there official jobs for being a critic? They shouldn't be paid to write a few paragraphs. They should only be information sources people go to if they want spoilers or opinions, but unfortunately these low lives get paid to do that type of job. The world has gone upside down. It truly has.<br/><br/>But let's get back on track. This movie is for the action fanatic, for the kid in you that wants to spring back out and enjoy your old child-hood of what life was growing up in whatever decade you were a kid in. I was a 90's kid, but was born at the height of the 80's. In 1989 to be specific, so I didn't have the luxury to be hyped for the latest action movie from heavy hitting stars like Arnie or Sly. I instead grew up with their movies on VHS in the 90's, and to see that cast come back alive with some of my other favourite action stars was a dream come true. Seeing Arnie and Sly talk for just that 2 minutes alone was a dream come true. You know, I kept watching Last Action Hero and Demolition Man to lookout for how Arnie talks about Sly in that fictional T2 poster with Sly on the cover or how John Spartan goes to the future in Demolition Man to be informed by Sandra Bullock's character that Arnie IS the president. And funny thing is, he is in politics now and I think I've heard him wanting to run for that shot of the big man in the White House. But aside from those two movies, I ALWAYS, for as long as I can remember; have been wanting to see Arnie and Sly in one movie together, face to face and this movie does that for me.<br/><br/>I thank Sly for his contribution to the world for this amazing work of film. On such a low budget, he managed to make the 80's and early 90's come out in us, adults. He re-awakened our inner child, of what it meant to enjoy life before the expectations society has set out on you after you entered high-school and finished it. He made me feel like a kid again. I think I might just cry. 10 out of 10. You are the man, Stallone, you truly are."

It gets even worse when the actors start talking. The sequence where Arnold, Bruce and Stallone meet has been done well, but Arnold looks way too old. Jet Li is wasted in a comic role.

Special effects looked VERY cheap and in the end there was no point. <br/><br/>The story was filled with pointless fluff to try and pad the movie but I think I would have much rather had the characters stay silent. Some of the jokes actually make me feel sorry for Sylvester Stallone and the movie as a whole made me lose all respect for him.<br/><br/>You can write, direct and produce a film practically all by yourself.

"dilenamountoo","2","15","27","4 September 2010"," A Painful Homage
","Remember the '80s, back when action movies became a a fairly big genre of the form? Back when classic action movies like the Rambo series and Conan came out? That's what Stallone is aiming for in the Expendables, but unfortunately, the attempt falls flat on its slack-lipped face.<br/><br/>I love some of those big dumb '80s action movies. I loved Rambo III, which for the record, ended with a tank crashing into a helicopter. I love over the top action sequences that often break upwards of eight laws of physics in the span of several seconds. The Expendables doesn't give you anything like that, instead feigning the over the top guise with that demon shaky cam. How am I supposed to enjoy the action if I can't SEE it?<br/><br/>Also, I don't know anything about any of the characters except for Mickey Rourke and Dolph Lundgren, who are only in a few scenes themselves. Instead, I guess Stallone thought we wanted to hear about Terry Crews' shotgun that shoots exploding rounds, which would be cool, IF HE WERE TO DO SOMETHING PARTICULARLY RIDICULOUS WITH IT. But no, they gave Dolph and Mickey really interesting back stories and didn't touch upon them AT ALL. Did I mention Randy Couture has cauliflower ears? Interesting. NOW WHY DO I NEED TO KNOW THAT?!?!?!<br/><br/>I also have no idea if the main woman was supposed to be a love interest for Stallone's character, or just someone he idolizes. This is mainly due to the fact that all the dialogue they share is really awkward and poorly written. ""What is a gift if it isn't free?"" Who talks like that? I don't know, why not ask cauliflower ear guy?<br/><br/>There was a fly-by shooting scene near the beginning of this movie that I guess was supposed to be much more amazing than it turned out to be, and the final confrontation with Steve Austin SUCKED, especially considering he and the other villain in this movie were poorly built up. Really, they made Steve Austin an unstoppable war machine who can't be stopped even by the mighty fist of ""Sly"" or a giant gasoline fire. What are we supposed to think as cauliflower ear guy wrestles with somebody four times his size? That he can actually defeat Steve Austin? Yeah. We're supposed to believe this.<br/><br/>Also, how did they get back to the island on the plane? How do you hide a giant plane?<br/><br/>This movie sucks. They should've given Mickey Rourke and Dolph Lundgren more screen time. 'Nuff said."

"kobrakommand","2","24","47","26 August 2010"," The greatest let down in Movie History
","I can believe that the average person liked this movie, but at least tell me the critics didn't like it.<br/><br/>THIS MOVIE SUCKED!<br/><br/>Waited for this movie to come for a year, and it was the biggest let down in the history of movies. I thought there were better action stars in this movie, but when you look at it, you've got Stallone, Lundgren, and Statham. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Arnold, don't do a damn thing. Mickey Rourke has one speech, and that's pretty much the only dialogue in this movie. Jet Li wasn't funny, I don't care what your friends say, I could barely understand what he was saying as it was. Terry Crews as big as he may be, he just doesn't seem right in action movies, but he's an amazing actor and he was pretty believable in Gamer and in this movie he's likable, and could have been a great character but the movie gives you no background on him and you only see him at the beginning and end of the movie along with Randy Couture. The movie focuses on Stallone mostly, along with Jason Statham. Now the scene with Jason Statham beating up his girlfriends replacement boyfriend could have been great, but it was so misused. You see the same thing used in so many movies, but it's used well and it's always likable. In this movie no, it's garbage. Statham finds his girlfriend with another man, so he leaves all sad and disheartened he comes back a few scenes later to see shes got a black eye, so he goes to beat up this guy, and ends up whooping his *ss along with a couple other guys. It's something you see time and time again, but in this movie it's done without any emotion without any build up, its so just put in there, that it has no effect. Other movies would have built up a scene like that through the whole movie, this one just throws it in there through a couple of scenes, and then we never see Statham with his girlfriend again.<br/><br/>Now I know you watch an action movie for action, but this was some of the worst action I've ever seen. So there were some explosions, WHOOPIE! explosions are boring, I can go in my backyard and light off M80's if I want to see explosions, I want action, people being shot, people in sword fights, people fist fighting. And yes there is fist fights and shooting, but none of it is enjoyable. Whoever edited this movie together needs to be shot, I mean maybe it was the directors fault either way. There are so many cuts in the action scene that you can't tell what the heck is going on. Jet Li versus Dolph Lundgren, yah big guy versus small guy that's really original, I mean I've definitely never seen that before. There is one good action scene, but it's really short. That is when Terry Crews comes through with his AA12 with a drum mag and starts blowing people apart. A bit unrealistic but very satisfying. That's it.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie consists of a lot of scenes that involve no action and are boring as all hell. And a couple of knife throwing contests that are cheesier than the lasagna i had last night.<br/><br/>See the movie, but don't expect much out of a killer cast. The movie is dry and dull, I expected the action movie of a lifetime and was given an action movie that was below average. It's seriously an epic fail for something that had great potential."

","Ow my God... this was probably the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life. Every bad scene, every bad story line, every bad one-liner that Stallone ever dreamt of during his entire career on set (but which were always duly rejected by directors with more sense for quality) found their way into this film. The film contains every terrible stereotype that's ever been used in 100 years of film history, and badly executed at that. There's just nothing positive to say about this film, absolutely nothing. What a waste of money... Never will I decide to watch a film again solely based on the rating at IMDb. 8.5? You gotta be kidding. Has the film crew's family been rigging the votes for this?"
"satana-6","1","20","39","25 August 2010"," Does it get any worse than this?
","First off, I like action. Terminator 1&2, Die hard series, Predator, Crank, Running Man, Under Siege, Bloodsport, Rambo, Fight Club, Bond, a few of the Rocky movies, etc... These are some of, and the kinds of movies, I like, some old some new. I don't mind cheesy, sometimes.<br/><br/>However, this movie was a stinker. Stallone, and his puffy plastic surgery face, his pubic haired transplant hair, is disgusting to look at on the big screen. It sad, as I used to like Stallone. I just don't see any character in his face. He looks like an old, eyebrow dyed and plucked douche, and he is unpleasant to sit through for 2 hours. He has so many tight shots of himself because he is soooo full of himself. Yuck! Lundgren and Roberts look like guys his age should look, gristled, aged and weary, and tough, but Stallone looks like an LA Guido! <br/><br/>That aside, the dialogue is weak and leaves you feeling icky. The characters feel bogus. There is no plot. There are loads of explosions and lots of gunfire, but after a while, who cares. 1000 bad guys can't shoot their heavy machine guns to hit guys point blank. Please don't insult the viewer like this. I don't care if any of the good guys live or die. Statham, Rourke, Roberts, and Lundren are the only decent name brand actors. I don't count the big name cameos. The rest blow chunks and leave you feeling nauseous.<br/><br/>Take my advice and steer clear of this garbage. You'll thank me when you actually see this poop on video and am soooo happy you didn't blow your cash on this at the theatre."

","Yes, summer 2010 is ending. It's pretty sad isn't it. After ""Iron Man 2"", ""Robin Hood"" and so on until now, it's the moment of rocking movies. Now, August 13 is the end of all those moments as we have to wait until November for another short movie season. So, why don't you do yourself a favor to end Summer 2010 by watching this explosive, action-packed movie, ""The Expendables"".<br/><br/>First things first, the cast is obviously awesome. Meet your favorite actors: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Steve Austin, Dolph Lundgren and even Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's definitely awesome and rare to see such a great ensemble in one film. Sadly, most of them appear on screen for a short time except Stallone and Statham who receive the most screen time. <br/><br/>The action. Totally breathtaking. It's very loud and enjoyable and yes, there's a lot of blood. The fights were worth the money you pay for watching the film and it's very satisfying. <br/><br/>Let's start with the movie. The first hour can be called boring as we are still learning the characters and their strategy etc. Skip the first 60 minutes, that's when the real action begins. A 30+ minute battle in a small island begins as explosions, noise and plenty of blood on the screen. Stallone and his friends kicks ass in the final hour of the film. And not to forget, there's some comedy in the film. <br/><br/>The story. Well, you know Hollywood. Hollywood can make a film so exciting even with a simple story concept and ""The Expendables"" is one of those films. The story is so simple that it's about Stallone or Barney Ross with The Expendables assigned to eliminate a general in an island called Vilena. It's very simple but the movie is very exciting. <br/><br/>However, to the more negative sides of the film is the special effects. The blood looked pretty fake at several scenes as when it spreads, it really looked unreal. The explosions and others were of course life-like. <br/><br/>""The Expendables"" overall is a very exciting film. It's another great job by Sylvester Stallone. It's a very good way to end the enjoyment of Summer 2010 movies. I recommend this to moviegoers who love action movies and people who love Sylvester Stallone on action. It's worth to sepend your time and sure to not disappoint you people. In a word, ""The Expendables"" is ... awesome!<br/><br/>Prince AJB's rating: 8/10.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review on ""The Expendables"" and hope it's useful."
"GrowMagicBeans","4","25","51","27 August 2010"," To many Action Heroes fail to boil the Broth...
","Unfortunately this movie failed to deliver for me... I was never expecting too much intellectually from a popcorn guzzling title such as this, but the casting did sound promising. The lineup was cram packed with some of my favourite action heroes, past and present. I can usually leave my brain at the door and enjoy such movies because I can suspend with my disbelief, but even realising the obvious, there were just too many elements that irritated me about this feature. <br/><br/>Camera shake was overly used to supposedly heighten tension. But with a cast like Jet Li and Jason Statham (and that's not to say the rest of the cast couldn't throw a convincing punch or two!), I wanted to see a decent martial arts battle without the scene being intermittently cut, chopped and shook to death. It is an action movie after all... I want to SEE the action! Indeed, the editing of the movie in general was pretty sloppy. I didn't enjoy the pacing – it felt too rushed, too choppy, too muddled.<br/><br/>Scripting was another big issue. Okay, I know we don't want to dwell on a love plot too long, but the motivation of Stallone's character to return to the island... well, lets just say it felt weak at best. I did enjoy Mickey Rourke's little story of regret. Indeed Rourke's performance surprisingly was the best of all, considering how short his on screen time was. His story of regret nearly had me there! But I needed a little more from Stallone to be convinced. In the end of the day, action movie or not, motivation needs to be felt, described, or at least explained.<br/><br/>Lets be honest, the storyline was awful! Okay once again, it being a Stallone movie I was not expecting the plot to be challenging, but was it too much to expect a movie in the tradition of the 'mission movie'? After all, that seemed to be premise and vein on which the movie was built. It's suggested in the title 'The Expendables', a movie about a group of mercenary muscle men, sent in to do the jobs that others won't. Stallone should have done his research. He should have watched the classics like, The Dirty Dozen, or Where Eagles Dare... would it have been to ask too much to try create a little tension? Of course we all know things are going to go horribly wrong at one point or another, but lets just pretend that a proper plan had been forged before our die hards have to resort to out and out carnage.<br/><br/>Lastly, the one thing that attracted me to the movie in the first place -the fact that there were so many action heroes involved- ultimately led the movie to fail. It was tatty and unpolished. It's clear to me that last minute scenes were created and the plot mashed around haphazardly just to fit cameos in as more mega-stars came on board the project. The scene in the church for example, with Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schawarzenegger felt totally out of place. Acting wise It was as if they were playing but parodies of themselves. Plot wise, it made little contextual sense. Schawarzenegger's character did not further the plot any way, other then they wanted to have Schawarzenegger and Stallone on screen together. Okay, bringing in the outside persona of the actor to create a little laugh within the context of the movie can be fun, but all too often the movie relied on these cheap gags. To me, it seemed to be a movie created more for the impressive trailer rather then for the sake of a movie in itself. Even the movie Machete managed to make a better narrative out of its fake trailer! <br/><br/>The movie seemed to really struggle with which characters to focus upon. It seemed to take primary focus around the two characters played by Stallone and Statham, yet desperately tried to scribble in one too many of the other peripheral characters, again perhaps as big names came on board. The result was, I felt we got to half know a lot of characters we really cared little about. In this way Stallone really failed to fix the focus correctly. Tell us the story of the team or tell us the story of the main two characters, but don't just half tell either!<br/><br/>...a movie that held promise, was nearly there in spots, but did not quite manage in its final delivery."
"BA_Harrison","2","27","56","20 August 2010"," What's the matter, Arnie... been pushing too many pencils?
","I'm not stupid: I realise that 'x' times the number of action stars does not necessarily equal 'x' times the amount of action, but with the biggest names of the genre together in one supposedly bad-ass, big budget, testosterone fuelled film, directed by Rambo himself, I at least expected to feel a mild rush of excitement at some point during the whole thing. Instead, I just found myself cringing throughout, which was a tad disappointing, to say the least.<br/><br/>Not only does The Expendables have a plot so weak that it probably would have been rejected for the A-Team (not the film, but the TV series, and we're talking Season 5 here), but it also suffers from charmless performances from its stars (who are not exactly helped by the absolutely dire dialogue), a very dull first half hour, and some of the most ill-considered action direction, lousy cinematography and scrappy CGI effects I have seen in years.<br/><br/>The photography is inexplicably grainy and frequently out of focus, the scatter-shot editing is absolutely diabolical (does any shot last more than a second?), and the digital blood splats frustratingly unrealistic, but it is Stallone's overuse of 'shakycam' that is particularly appalling—seriously Sly, what's the point of signing up such an impressive all-star cast if you're going to turn every action sequence into unfathomable visual mincemeat?<br/><br/>Oh, and Arnie.... next time, either grab a gun and get stuck in, or just stay behind the desk.

And it's not that there isn't much action, but the problem is that, not only the movie but also the action scenes are very bad!! It was supposed to be a outstanding movie, with all those cool actors coming back, all the hype and great action scenes without CGI to show that it's possible to do real action without too much annoying special effects made by computer. The idea was great, the cast very impressive (for this kind of movie), and it could have been a real awesome movie. But it turned out to be a real mess. Some actors don't appear enough, and the ones that do are annoying and very unfunny sometimes (all that story about Statham's girlfriend was silly). The plot it was not supposed to be great, but at least to make some sense and give the movie some reason. And the action is just terrible because the camera just don't let us see almost anything of what's going on! (and the ""shaking camera"" it is cool, but when used wisely and not all the time!). There's only one real remarkable action scene (one involving a airplane and a ""pier""), because the others are not exciting and well made enough. But, to say that there's some good stuff, Mickey Rourke is really great and the scene with Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis it is fun (some jokes are not, but the scene was cool). At least it's a very fast movie. And unfortunately, very disappointing. Maybe Stallonne should have hired a director, because he's not a good one."

How could it NOT be - with the incredible cast of action stars Stallone had assembled?<br/><br/>For the most part I enjoyed it. But why in the world did Stallone shoot almost every action scene in such close-up that you absolutely cannot tell what is happening? It's as if he took a class in how to be action artsy-fartsy in film school and used what he learned to totally screw up his movie. You see blood fly, fists pound flesh, knives slice into throats, guns blaze, bodies drop - and you absolutely can't tell who did what to whom! It's just basic filmmaking incompetence in my opinion. The editing makes it worse by attempting to create frenzy and excitement through rapid cuts that last merely a few frames, but again, it's like someone told them that's the way to create a fast-paced, exciting scene. The quality of the stunt work is excellent, and obviously it was totally unnecessary to split every action into 30 individual cuts.<br/><br/>So I'm frustrated. A great action movie with an incredible cast that is pretty much ruined through nothing more than stylistic and technical incompetence. <br/><br/>And why the heck did they show you-know-who in the preview trailer to totally destroy his wonderful cameo appearance!"

Stallone has become a better director through time; directing is a strong point of this movie. The camera takes the audience inside the action and in front of the dialogues.Arnie's extended cameo appearance is a plus. It is a pity Van Damme and Seagal are not here,however Dolph Lundgren does his part fairly well.Overall this movie is a classic one and a must-see for action movie fans.

It has no plot, that little plot summary on the top of the page that says, ""A team of mercenaries head to South America on a mission to overthrow the dictator"" yeah that happened in the last 20 minutes of the movie, and it wasn't even to overthrow a dictator, it was to get some chick.<br/><br/>Also there is no character background at all. You have no idea where anyone came from or how they got together. And in the trailer where is says Bruce Willis's name near the top of the list, you only saw him for a minute. That one little part where you see him in the trailer, that was it. Then there was Shawzenegger which is always seen for a second. You can tell the film makers said, ""Quick! After work, stop by and say s few lines in front of the camera."" And he did. <br/><br/>Along with there being no plot, no character background, the camera was shaking in every action sequence so bad you just have to turn your head and look away before you threw up. And its funny because the camera mostly shook when old man Sylvester wasn't in front of it which probably means he was the one holding it."
"jdkraus","8","12","22","15 September 2010"," Exactly what I hoped for.
","I haven't seen a really good, hardcore, shoot 'em bang 'em up action flick in a long time. When I went to see this movie with a couple of buddies, that's what I was hoping for. My wish came true. <br/><br/>As a kid, I have grown up watching the big action heroes portrayed by Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Statham, Li, and many more. Seeing close to a dozen action stars together in one movie is a real treat. All of the actors do not just deliver classic one-liners, brutal action sequences, and plenty of testosterone and macho attitudes, but they also immerse themselves into their characters. It's easy to love the tough good guys and hate the cruel bad guys. Unfortunately, Schwarzenegger and Willis only receive mere cameos, but at least they were present in the film. I will note that Schwarzenegger, however, gets the best intro and exit of any character in the movie. <br/><br/>The action sequences is another thing worth noting; they're not only great, but the immerse CGI adds a somewhat stylized/cartoonish look to them. There's a somewhat 300 style to the violence in the excessive blood splatter, yet no slow motion is used. Instead, all of the action is very quick and crisply edited—this makes it hard to keep up with the body count I might add. <br/><br/>In regards to plot, do not expect much. I predicted it all from the beginning, but there is a nice twist that I didn't see coming at the end. I don't hold this against the movie though, because plot is not its purpose. The film's goal is to provide mindless action—the perfect escapism. That's what I like about this film. When this comes out on DVD, I'll certainly pick it up and if Stallone decides to do a sequel, I'll definitely go see it on the big screen. <br/><br/>The one thing that I did not like about this movie is the sound design. My buddies and I noticed that the music and effects were very loud, but the dialog was real quiet. I have nothing wrong with loud explosions and gunshots in a film, but I do not appreciate quiet dialog—which is supposed to be the most important aspect of sound in cinema. Other than this, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. If mindless, bloody, hardcore action with tough guys as the heroes is your fetish, then go see this movie!"

","I'm afraid i'm throwing my hat in the ring here and probably going to upset some people, but i've got to be honest. This film wasn't just good, it wasn't just amazing, i cant find the appropriate words to say how thrilled and entertained i was by this movie. It honestly made me feel like a teenager again, it brought back every punch, every bullet fired and every exploding vehicle i watched in movies and on TV during the 80s. <br/><br/>I just simply cannot understand any person who claims to be an action movie fan not enjoying this. I wouldn't argue on the script or acting front for one second, (although i really found Mickey Rourke's monologue surprisingly touching),but in terms of quality and quantity of action this is inarguably a milestone in action cinema.<br/><br/>Hollywood has always made a lot of money from the summer films season and the output has changed dramatically since the 80s. I feel they should acknowledge their audience beyond the teens age group and for all the hundreds of millions Harry Potter, the Pirates and the Vampires generate, some of that profit should be put back into funding middle range budgeted films such as this.<br/><br/>I don't feel its an accurate perception that these films cant stir the kind of interest they once did, The Expendables box office would seem to contradict that. Even if you view the combined pulling power of the cast as a gimmick which has garnered interest here, i would ask, what word best describes cgi, since it in itself has become the focal selling point of most, if not all, blockbuster trailers now. <br/><br/>I don't want all superheroes, or any genre overly visited and wrung out, we live in an age which prides itself on offering choice to the consumer, from dining out to all forms of other entertainment. Offer old dogs like me more of this type of thing and enjoy my ""expendable"" income as well.<br/><br/>MR Stallone has come full circle and produced something both nostalgic and contemporary and above all, more fun than i've had in the cinema for a long time, good on ya Sly, now Expendables II please lickety-split !"

","If you want to enjoy ""The Expendables"", you have to forget all the good action movies of the past. You even have to forget the mediocre ones, because, oh boy, this is bad. I mean, really, really bad. There were some ""actors"" in this movie that I'm not familiar with, probably some wrestlers or NFL stars, and for those relatively unknown participants it might NOT be the worst film of their career. For all the other Hollywood elite actors it probably is. Even Dolph Lundgren played in way better movies than this. Oh, good God, I tried to forget that movie, but I think even ""Red Scorpion"" might have had a better story than this one. *shudder*<br/><br/>Speaking of the participating actors, don't get fooled: Schwarzenegger and Willis are somehow thrown into a two minute cameo appearance that makes no sense at all and features some of the worst dialogue ever. It's pathetic, who wrote this? And what does Stallone know about the Terminator and John McClane that enables him to force them into his movie? Blackmail is the only logical explanation I can think of in order for those two to give their names for such an abysmal piece of ... ""work"". <br/><br/>Make no mistake, I don't think much work went into the production of this ugly thing. Most of the budget was spent for the actors and marketing, I suppose. But the millions that went to the actors were wasted, basically there was not much to act out. Since the cardboard characters had no personality at all, everyone could have played their part. Everyone. You, me, some random guy from the street. Oh wait, it had to be someone that can keep a straight face, something that can be hard when you are forced to deliver some of the worst and most pointless dialogue I have ever witnessed in a professional production. There was single hint at personality with Mickey Rourke, but since he had no real part in the movie, it leaves no impact whatsoever.<br/><br/>This is not even an 80s movie, like some delusional moviegoers claim. It is one of those state-of-the-art-shaky-cam things with some actors that were known in the 80s, but you can't tell that in the action scenes, not only due the mentioned filming, but also due to the editing, where they tried to set a new record for as many cuts as possible. Something or somebody is cut here, shot there, it's very exciting, because something is happening - or at least it seems. Guess that makes it harder to realize it's actually stunt doubles performing most of the action, dunno. <br/><br/>It could have been great if they would have made a movie in the tradition of the great action flicks, some of which I mentioned in the title. They didn't. They created something new, a monster, which should be burned and never be talked about again. They did a B-... no, let's make it a C-, or even a D-movie with an A-list cast. Back in the good ol' days, it would have went straight to VHS. Nowadays, stuff like this makes it into the cinemas. It's a shame so many of the old heroes took a part in this. So, what you get is Stallone and Statham (the rest has significantly less screen time) in a quite successful attempt to create the most boring and pointless music video of all time. <br/><br/>You've been warned."

For every action film that I see, I lose more respect for people who are impressed by the same old explosions that made this genre, but even with that, a lot of them are actually watchable and funny or interesting to some extent. And don't buy the ""it's about the expectations""-argument for this one. Even if you expect a lousy and mindless Hollywood action flick, you will be disappointed by this. Anything else is self-delusion. A 7.1 average for this at the time of writing this is just sad."

","I was dragged to see this by my husband, who evidently quite enjoyed it. I did not. I have to say I'm completely mystified that it's so far received such high ratings. Was I at the same movie as these other people? The novelty of all these big action heroes of yesterday and today being together under one title soon wears off. Arnold is in it for maybe 2 minutes (hardly surprising given his day job) and he doesn't take his shirt off. Bruce isn't in it for much longer than that either. I'd call both of those cameo appearances.<br/><br/>The story was basic and obvious. The script was dire, a grade schooler could have written it. The acting was mostly poor and contained much ham - but then with that script it's hardly surprising. The action was overblown and often ridiculous, with people escaping the apparently inescapable without a scratch. Somehow all of our protagonists managed to avoid any injury whatsoever (with the exception of Dolph who was shot by Sly).<br/><br/>About the only thing that was remotely pleasing to me was that nobody made out with the damsel in distress. That would have been even more improbable than everyone getting away uninjured from all the explosions! Glad to see that Sly retained a smidgen of realism in this otherwise silly shoot em/blow em/burn em/squish em up."

It's packed with action stars, that's all.<br/><br/>The movie was the opposite of intellectual, or shall I say anti-intellectual. At the end, a superficial flick. Scene-after-scene was full of clichés, and I feel like anyone could have written this script. It simply just tried to overwhelm the audience with action and explosions and huge guns in its attempts to be a well movie. At the very least, the movie could have contained some nudity (those type of huge guns.)"
"MovieMaster95","4","17","35","3 October 2010"," Sadly Disappointing from Stallone's 80's revival
","First let me say that I love the action genre especially those from 80's and most of the 90's. Back when action films were for adult audiences and were brutal, bloody and had high body counts. Nowadays however, action movies are a lot more family friendly, with bloodless action, few swear words, over use of CG and an annoying shaky cam.<br/><br/>But when I heard Stallone (The star of Rambo) was going to make a big cheesy, 80's style action film with an ensemble cast, I couldn't be happier. When I finally went to see the film however I was sadly disappointed.<br/><br/>I was hoping for a simple plot, with an awesome team, an over the top villain (Unless Dolph Lundgren counts), cheesy one liners and old school action scenes. Sadly the film only briefly delivers...<br/><br/>The plot is just a bunch of terrorism propaganda which is very incoherent, Stallone and Statham seem to be the only characters the film focuses on, no memorable villain, not enough one liners (and some weren't even that good) and as for the action. It delivered on the gore but it was shot with a shaky cam and too many quick cuts which makes it almost impossible to tell what's going on. I was expecting a 'Predator' like film with a lovable team just wielding huge guns, killing bad guys and spouting quotable one liners.<br/><br/>The action is still quite fun at moments and very explosive, but I just wish it was shot the same way something like 'Commando' was filmed. The only scene that reached my expectations was the cameo scene with Schwarzenegger and Willis which is short but sweet. I don't really recommend 'The Expendables' but if Stallone hopes to make another, I hope he does a little history on classic cinema before so. Don't listen to those who say it's the 'Greatest Action Film Ever' as their are far better films that deserve that rank."

","As many of You all, I was looking forward to watching most of my favorite action-stars clash in this movie. The trailer looked promising as well, though I was expecting the filmmakers to have some difficulties making each action-star relevant enough to justify my expectations. To sum it up very short and swift, this was like hammering away on the war drums so everyone was getting scared shitless - and when everyone was expecting an enormous army of demons, out came a mere pack of cows.<br/><br/>I am truly disappointed. The story was just plain bad. And putting Jet Li amongst others in such senseless supporting roles borders insanity in my book. What they should have done was to create a storyline equal to ""Heat"" and make the true potential of the cast and budget come to life in a meaningful way lasting preferably 3 hours.

Less than a 7, then it depends on my mood. But it really gets to me when movies like this and Star Wars (the new crap) get overrated by the fanboys, hence this review.<br/><br/>First up: the movie isn't too lame, it's watchable. What you shouldn't expect is a classic. Liked Universal Soldier, Rambo, Predator, Die Hard? Watch them again and wait for this DVD. My main beef is the plot – there isn't one. It's like the scriptwriters went on strike again, so Stallone went to a random movie generator website.<br/><br/>Random island, random bad ass, random chicks, random fights. There are the in-jokes, one liners, cameos galore, but somehow you can't feel anything for the characters. Best actor goes to Mickey, who was the only actor who remembered to act. I tried to ignore all this, but then they have to make the violence cartoonish? Braveheart had better fights, so this was either an effects fail or a cheese win."
"MoronUnited","10","21","45","12 August 2010"," There's still some gas in the tank
","To put it bluntly, this is greatest action movie in ages. Sly has crafted a movie that is a perfect blend of story, comedy, and action that work together to keep the viewers locked in for the ride. It's a kind of action movie that has not been seen in decades, in that it's not about cramming explosions into a 90 minute block, rather telling an exciting story that involves characters you care about. The story is gripping and moving, the comedy is spot-on and releases tension, and the action, well....<br/><br/>When you buy a ticket to The Expendables, you are essentially paying to have your balls thrown into a blender. People are literally blown in half with rocket launchers, limbs and heads fly everywhere, and bullets fly across the screen in unfathomable quantities.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is a living legend and seeing him in an 80's style action flick is is a real treat. Dolph Lundgren is absolutely fantastic and this movie proves he should bring his straight-to-video action releases to the big screen. Jet Li's swift kicks and beautiful fighting techniques are stunning and Jason Statham shows that he truly is among the last remaining classic-style action stars. Steve Austin, Randy Coture, Terry Crews......all turn in great performances as well. And got to mention, the Stallone/Willis/Schwarzenegger scene? It delivers.<br/><br/>Wrap all this up and you get an action movie that is so 80's that it hurts. The movie flows perfectly, the action hits harder than anything out there today, and the characters are all well developed. By far the most satisfying movie in ages, The Expendables is the return of a genre lost in time, and I couldn't be happier."

"jwtrox08706","7","8","14","22 August 2010"," It does what it set out to do...It entertains
","Going into this film, I had some rather low expectations, but was hoping to see just a violent shoot-'em-up with an all-star action film cast. I was actually pleasantly surprised as to how entertaining this film is.<br/><br/>First of all, the cast is great, even though as a rule I tend to stray away from casts that feature a lot of big names. The film was well cast, and acted pretty well, too. The only problem is, I think there was just not enough room for all of these names to have their time on screen. However, they all work well together; so, it sort of balances out.<br/><br/>Second, it certainly is not without action. There is plenty of violence and dismemberment to wet the beaks of the most action-hungry movie goers, but it is not totally over the top. It definitely is a film that, if they were still reviewing films together, Siskel and Ebert would criticize for being too noisy, but if you go into a film like this without even the slightest expectations that you are going to be bombarded with in your face noise and action, then you have some serious problems. The film also sort of brings up some current or recent affairs (Somali pirates was the one that stood out the most for me), and takes the ""let's kick some ass"" route with them, but at the same time it still has a moral code to it as well.<br/><br/>Finally, I just like going into a film like this one, considering the times we are in with all the gray matter and things not being cut and dry, and having all of that just pushed to the side: you have your good guys and you have your bad guys. Yes, this film has a touch of its own gray matter, but it's not overwhelming. The timing of this film's release has made this point a positive one, instead of a negative one.<br/><br/>A film as fun as this one was is not without its flaws.<br/><br/>First of all, the writing just left a lot to be desired, but the action and comedy in it more than made up for that. That being said, do not be surprised if you find yourself wincing now and then at some very cheesy lines.<br/><br/>Second, as I mentioned, this film is very crowded with big stars. In many cases, you like the idea of all of these big names in one film, but how can you have room for all of them?<br/><br/>Third, there was too much CG blood and violence. Computer effects are great, but it was utilized way too much, as if it was a crutch—especially for violence. To boot, you can clearly tell that it's CG as well. If there had been more makeup effects and down and dirty special effects used like in the old days for things like decapitations or someone catching fire, I would have been much more impressed. As it is, though, the CG effects in this film are kind of cheesy and can easily be spotted. A good CG effect is one that you at least have to do a double take to see that it is in fact a CG effect or, best case scenario, have to find out later on that it is a CG effect (case and point, the digital removal of Ralph Fiennes nose when he played Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter films looks very much like a well-done make-up effect but is in fact a CG effect).<br/><br/>All in all, this film is good for when you just need a movie to entertain you. It's a great way for even one of the most critical moviegoers, like myself, to just sit back and enjoy a film for what it is as opposed to trying to find a deeper meaning. It's a guilty pleasure, and it is well- done in that respect. I applaud Sly for making this very entertaining film. But, just as a precaution, I wouldn't recommend this as a date movie, unless she's really into some good solid hardcore action films."

The script was utter rubbish, especially the humor failed to deliver. All the one liners were tired, unimaginative and delivered without feeling. The acting was bad, but this was naturally a given, and it didn't bother me. The worst part, by a mile, was the action. Everything that is wrong in action scenes produced in Hollywood today was there, and it was there in pounds. Angles changing every 0.5 seconds, shaking, nothing but close-ups, confusing angles... All the tricks you can pull to hide the fact that these old men weren't really up for the physical part of their roles, or that they just wanted to take the easy way out. The only saving grace of the film was the last 20 or so minutes, which were filled with nothing but action, some of it decent.<br/><br/>On paper it was a great thing that some of my favorite actions stars made a film together, but after having seen the end result, I wish this movie had never been made."

But such unreality ought be leavened by a pinch of verisimilutude, a sharp line or a sympathetic character, otherwise it'll fall flat.<br/><br/>'The Expendables' expends all these leavenings. Oh, but it doesn't stop there, even the action sequences are, to say the least, unimpressive. The climactic fight scenes take place in a dark tunnel, so it's hard to see what's happening and there is no room for any choreographed balletic action.<br/><br/>To make an obvious comparison, the firehose fight sequence in 'Transporter 2' is beautifully managed, the action, the camera-work, the editing, all work together to make a cinematically impressive fight sequence, as ridiculous as it may be in realistic terms. Nothing in 'The Expendables' comes close.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are little more than names. The dialogue is leaden (how could any screenwriter want to put their name to it?) and clunks around the movie like heavy chains around the actors necks. There is one woman in the movie, she's water-tortured. The final action sequences, when the castle collapses, the ammo dump explodes, are just plain stupid.<br/><br/>Evidence for the prosecution: Sly asks Terry to throw a shell into the air, Sly shoots it with his full auto 68 round handgun and it explodes, destroying a helicopter.

Although i did enjoy the game at the end of knife darts between the always cool no matter what he does Mickey Rourke and Stathum. Stallone has directed and written very cool movies before such as Rocky Balboa and the newest Rambo so i don't know what the hell went wrong with this?

","Sly Stallone has been in a lot of films in his career, most have been poor, a few ( Copland, Cliffhanger, Rambo First Blood and Rocky) have been good. This is another addition to the poor list. The power of Hollywood legends is considerable. When Sly decided that he wanted to write, direct and star in this movie no-one was strong enough to say no. The result reeks of self indulgence.<br/><br/>The story, such as it is, is perfunctory. An ""A Team"" style collection of ageing hard men is called upon to deal with a South American traitor, laced with a risible sub-plot involving CIA double dealing. Obviously this involves a lot of explosions and people being blown up – but that is about it. Apart from some good action sequences, including a questionable obsession with knives, precious little entertains.<br/><br/>An opening sequence in which ""the expendables"" free hostages held by pirates is quite promising, but thereafter it is only when guns are blazing, knives are slashing and things are blowing apart that any interest is created. To describe the characters as one dimensional would be generous. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a walk on part which is little more than an excuse for a gag. Jet Li's martial arts skills are woefully underemployed, his presence is little more than a lever to secure interest in the far east. Mickey Rourke reminded us in the Wrestler what a good actor he is, here he has nothing to do of note. Bruce Willis looks smug, about what I am unsure. Dolph Lungren is simply awful, Jason Statham provides a modicum of respectability with some semblance of character and conviction.<br/><br/>Stallone himself tries too much. The story is not up to it, nor is the dreadful dialogue. Why these men are ""expendable"" is largely unclear, and anything which is not an action set-piece falls flat. Naturally Stallone gets to gaze into the eyes of the female lead, Charisma Carpenter, who looks considerably younger than her years. Crucially we don't really care about any of the characters, it is nor well written enough for that. Furthermore the good v evil axis is unconvincing. Are ageing mercenaries the good guys? Are all South American Dictators bad guys? Is the shadowy rogue ex-CIA man bad or good? And you end up not really being bothered either way"

","As if the mindless carousel of moronic violence in ""Rambo IV"" wasn't enough, poor Sly really made a point to show us that if he really wants to make a retarded movie, he's up to it anytime! Definitely, this is one of the most amateurish, boring, irritatingly dumb flicks we ever saw. The scenario is simply an exercise in olygophrenia. An obsolete type of story devoid of any originality and logic, awkwardly knitted together, as if there was no such thing as screen writing, with its rules to learn and apply. <br/><br/>Further, the directing is slow-paced, bumbling, unable at least to communicate in a coherent way the so-called ""story"". Instead of ""characters"", we have a bunch of lifeless mannequins, with no identity or personality, mixing together in a ridiculous saraband of gratuitous brutality. As if by accident, most of them are played by some performers whom we remember for really good roles, in some old movies. Among the top-most moronic blunders of this ""movie"", one could mention the ""Stallonian sling"" (a childish unworking version of the ""Tchekhovian gun""): Mr. Church (Bruce Willis' character) warns Sly at the beginning: ""Don't try to take the money and run, because me and my people will find you!"" - and this is about all! Not even by accident such an occurrence is brought again to the audience mind - for certain, till the end, Sly forgot that he put it there! (The same as he forgot that it's the same thing that he did to the audience: he got their money and ran away, without delivering anything else but another unprofessional and bad taste piece of trash. And, of course, the title: these is no such thing as ""expendable heroes"" here (as, for instance, in ""Rambo II"" or ""The Losers""). They are simply idiotically invincible and, as such, sent to slaughter a whole army as if it was made up of faulty puppets."
"Schuriken","1","6","10","3 October 2012"," Shapeshifting Faces Of Stallone
","Has anyone noticed Stallone's face these days ? It's not just his age he looks like a shapeshifter that shapeshifts but not exactly. His face is like melting down on him and that strange looking ears are really disgusting to look at. <br/><br/>Stallone looks very bored and drunk as hell in every scene of this ghastly production and he gives us the impression that he shot this film during happy hours or something. No face expressions what so ever and he is far from average acting, he just stands there with his melted face and draws his guns.<br/><br/>Jet Li takes the cake by looking extremely bored throughout the whole movie, this film could be Li's worst ever. His face seems to tell us ""please get on with it I have to go and do something else...."" even during his stupid fight scenes.<br/><br/>What the hell does Crews have to do with this film I just don't get it. He is great fun in his own feutures but in this one I guess Sly hired him just to say that single famous line after the shotgun massacre and thats about it for him.<br/><br/>Statham looks pretty cool with his hoop tricks and seems he is the only one acting out his bad ass role in some way.<br/><br/>Arnold looks like a burned out Christmas tree from the 80's, it's very impressive that he can open his mouth and speak out two words in all.<br/><br/>The whole new marketing image with the brand new computer graphics posters does not mix with the old pack playing in the movie, I wish Sly could promote his movie in old fashioned themes and posters, that would be interesting. Instead the posters look very 21st century with 20th century action heroes and that really sucks.<br/><br/>Scenario was written on a coffe table watching cartoons or something.<br/><br/>As a huge Sly fan I'm very disappointed that he tries to look very tough but he doesn't get it right anymore. There's no single line he sais that could take me inside his head and movie theme. Fail.<br/><br/>That's All Folks !!"
"supertom-3","9","19","42","9 August 2010"," Sly's time machine. Lets go back to the 80's!!
","Ever since the film was first announced, way back in November 2008, Stallone's action ensemble spectacular, The Expendables, has been in the forefront of every genre fans mind since. Starting with the triple casting of Stallone, Statham and Li, it was awesome enough. Then add Lundgren, Rourke, Austin, Couture, Gary Daniels and Eric Roberts, and it sent fans into delirium. Then throw in a dash of Bruce Willis and Ahnuld Schwarzenegger, and bed sheets in explosive action movie poster adorned bedrooms around the world, were soiled! So after a year and a half plus, of waiting, does it deliver? Yes! The plot is kept very simple. There's no real surprise in the film, but fans aren't here for storyline. Better too simple, than to make things too bogged down in convoluted sub-plot. Sly leads his team of good guys, against Eric Roberts team of bad guys. The mission goes wrong at first, leading to the capture of the beautiful Sandra, a native who acts as contact for Sly's band of mercs at the mission locale. Sly decides it's in his best interests to go back on perhaps a suicide mission, to try and save the girl. His team join him for the last harruh.<br/><br/>The film is short and loaded with characters. As such there's not too much development on any of them, especially peripheral roles. Stallone is the glue that holds the film together. Sly has great chemistry with everyone here. There's a sense of vulnerability about Barney Ross, and a sense of personal struggle here. Stallone's hound dog eyes bringing the soul of the character through, despite little in the writing, or the mumbled dialogue that suggests it. Statham as Lee Christmas is also solid. His arc comes from a somewhat needless subplot with his on-off girl friend. That extends to little more than him coming back one day to find she has a new boyfriend, and then coming back later to find new boyfriend, has smacked her around. It's Frank Martin again in truth, with the deep raspy drawl and erratic Brit-American accent shift again in evidence. But I don't care, because Statham is badass and that's what counts. He's got presence. Jet Li seems utterly redundant in the film though. Serving little purpose and given no dimension.<br/><br/>The characters, with limited arcs devoted to each, mean that the more theatrical roles stand out. Mickey Rourkes brief appearance is excellent as Tool, a former Expendable. Mickey gets to swoop in and steal all his scenes, and none more so than his monologue, that in part provides Ross a catalyst to risk it all to save Sandra, and his soul. Rourke nails it, giving Tool's character a sense of tragedy and poignancy. He's a ghost of a man now. By the same token, Dolph Lundgren manages to upstage his co-stars when he gets screen time. Gunnar Jensen is unpredictable, uncontrollable and difficult to read. In one hand he likes to play the joker, but there's darkness and intensity behind the façade. Years of too many drugs and too many kills have taken their toll, and Lundgren embodies the character brilliantly. Like Rourke, you just wish there was more, especially as Li, Crews and Couture (they do well with what little they have though) have even less depth and impact. Retrospectively, two or three could have been trimmed from the cast, to devote more time to Stallone and Statham's characters, and especially Rourke and Lundgren. Elsewhere Eric Roberts delivers a vintage Roberts bad guy. It's easy, yet perfect casting and he revels in chewing his scenery. Stone Cold adds menace, while B-movie veteran Gary Daniels delivers his best performance ever, with the benefit of having real direction for the first time. It's a small role but his performance reaches competence for the first time, while his fight with Li and Statham is memorable.<br/><br/>The big selling point of this film of course, is action. There's plenty of it. The opening is all too brief, seemingly trimmed down, so an extended DVD release may deliver even more carnage. Still, it packs a punch and sets the violent tone of the film. Then there's an array of vehicular set pieces and fights, before the finale. The finale is what will really have 80's action fans cart-wheeling with joy. It's nearly half an hour of unrelenting, old school, carnage! Like a combination of Commando, Invasion USA, Red Scorpion and Rambo 2 and 3's end action scenes, it's insane, and brilliant. It's a total antithesis to most modern action films too. We've all the classics here, brutal fights, gung-ho attitude, explosions (and jumping away from) and although grounded, with a sense of unreal, Reagan era glee.<br/><br/>In all, The Expendables delivers what fans will want. Unashamed, 80's style carnage. It's not one for the critics, who'll continue to judge on plot and character, and dismiss a need for a movie 20 years outdated, but it's for the fans and on the whole, will delight. There is a sense that dramatic moments are forced in, but that was also a trait of the 80's action film in any case, and the now completely unsurprising scene with Willis, Stallone and Arnold has lost any enigma for first time viewers, which is a shame. The scene is still a geeks delight though, and brimming with star power. Despite some faults, the film has plenty of star power and charm to ride on. In a strange way, the faults just seem to make it feel a little more 80's and add more to the charm. It's just great to watch an old school action film again, and to see a collection of tough guys doing their thing. The Expendables does what it says on the tin, and for that, Stallone deserves thanks and praise. Roll on the Extended cut on DVD!"

","Oh dear, where do I start? The ageing Sylvester Stallone assembles a very impressive cast for this unmitigated disaster of a movie. Whilst I wasn't expecting a collection of the greatest action films ever rolled into one epic blockbuster, I was hoping for something a little more substantial than this embarrassment.<br/><br/>The plot; a group of over-the-hill mercenaries do the business on a fictitious island, killing hundreds of baddies in the process, whilst miraculously not enduring any casualties themselves! Yawn.<br/><br/>Opening with an attack on a ship hijacked by Somali pirates, (and I doubt very much that any of them were actually Somali) stupid dialogue is sprouted off right before the baddies get massacred. With Dolph Lundgren about to hang the last one, his comrades protest by saying ""that's not how we operate,"" before being attacked by Jet Li. Yawn.<br/><br/>Back in the world, the goodies all assemble at a tattoo parlour owned by the appropriately named Tool (Mikey Rourke). Spouting off some nonsense about a girl jumping off a bridge in Bosnia - yawn - he dishes out the jobs, lining up a meeting with Bruce and Arnie. The meeting takes all of 60 seconds, just long enough for a really pathetic joke about Arnie running for president. Yawn.<br/><br/>Visiting the island where a dodgy dictator needs sorting out, it becomes clear that a dodgy ex-CIA goon is the real target, which Sly manages to figure out all by himself. Yawn. The rest of the film is basically a yawn fest, with lots of fights, explosions, baddies being killed, and the pretty girl being saved. Yawn.<br/><br/>I wish I could build a time machine, go back to the other night and stop myself from going in to see this drivel!

Neither was present in this film, and now I see there is a part 2. Come on, get real! I also agree with another commenter that action scenes need to be filmed at a distance that we can see them. If it is too close I get more irritated than any sense that I am in the fight. This movie was poorly filmed with completely stupid fighting outcomes.

"Leofwine_draca","7","5","8","5 February 2011"," Boom and bust, Stallone style
","I grew up on '80s action movies, still love them to bits and love watching ass-kicking on film. When I heard Stallone was making this film, featuring an ensemble cast of ageing action stars and deliberately harking back to '80s cinema, I was excited. I consider the 2008 RAMBO to be his best movie as star and director and I was hoping this would be somewhere nearly as good. It isn't, but it's still a fun movie. First off, the problems. The plot is all over the place. Long scenes are wasted introducing Jason Statham's ex-girlfriend character and then nothing happens with her – she just disappears and you don't see her again. The story, about overthrowing the dictator of a small island in South America and tackling his nefarious businessman colleague, feels like a half-baked reprise of COMMANDO. But let's be fair here – nobody goes to see THE EXPENDABLES for the plot.<br/><br/>No, my biggest problem is with Stallone's direction, which previously has been fine. Here, he decides to adopt a shaky-cam style for every action scene in the film, be it the explosive climax, a car chase or even a martial arts bout with star Jet Li. Paul Greengrass added heaps to his Bourne movies by utilising the shaky-cam, but it's a big detraction (not to mention distraction) here. Stallone's camera seems to be all over the place, to the extent that you can barely make out what's going on in any of the fight scenes. Moments like the 'tunnel fight', which variously sees Statham, Li, Stallone, Gary Daniels, and Steve Austin engaged in all manner of frenetic physical combat – become just okay. Maybe I was just sitting too near to the front of the cinema, but I fear not.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this film works just fine. The script adopts the right tone with plenty of referential humour for the fans. Stallone is still at his physical peak, and Statham the usual smooth-shaven action man we're used to from TRANSPORTER and CRANK. Dolph Lundgren has a ball as a slightly deranged fighter and Jet Li is the brunt of many jokes as the token Asian. I'm not a big fan of wrestlers or sportsmen, but Randy Couture, Steve Austin and Terry Crews are all sufficiently hulking to add to the film's look, and Eric Roberts entertains as the deliciously sleazy bad guy. Mickey Rourke's in this for little more than a cameo, but he has an oddly touching moment, while one of my biggest joys was seeing British fighter Gary Daniels as one of the bad guy henchmen. Looks like he's going up in the world. Much publicity surrounded the five-minute scene in this in which Stallone meets up with the guest stars - it's as funny as you could hope for. As for the action, it's over the top and extremely loud, involving our heroes flying planes and shooting or blowing up the bad guys, taking them down in hand-to-hand fights and smashing up some vehicles in frenetic car chases. The ending is as noisy and destructive as anything I've seen, and the best part of the film. A twenty minute sequence of chaos, calamity and kick-ass moves. My favourite part? Terry Crews and his hang cannon, which makes short work of the enemy.<br/><br/>Addendum: I've recently watched the director's cut of THE EXPENDABLES for the first time and I can report that it makes a BIG difference. Not only is an extra ten minutes of characterisation added - thus giving the film more heart and soul - but the whole thing has been re-edited to lost a lot of the choppiness the film suffered from originally. I have a feeling that Stallone was forced to rush the editing in the run-up to the film's cinema release, so he used the first opportunity he had to come back and tidy it up and the result is this: slicker, better paced, and much smoother. The action scenes have also been tightened up nicely so that they flow much better. The director's cut is definitely the version to watch."

"Jakealope","1","14","30","7 September 2010"," Pure Rubbish, Juvenile Greaser Trash as Mainstream
","Stallone, like his Rambo character, has come full circle in his life and showed himself to be at heart an ignorant greaser punk still in junior high. Here is a great example: his gang of mercenaries, when they aren't flying around the world killing for fun & profit, they hang around some grungy tattoo parlor/garage where they sport their Harleys and old 50s & 60s hot rods while getting more moronic body graffiti etched onto their bulked out torsos. There they get a chance to spout their grade school locker room wisdom & bond. Not that Rambo was a work of art, but at least that character had some wounded noble savage quality to him that made him more bearable than the total cardboard murder machine he played in this one. Also, the latest Rambo movie, while offering up the extreme violence & usual gory savagery that Stallone helped make mainstream years ago, at least helped expose the world to the plight of the Kachins in Burma, as opposed to this excuse for gore and violence.<br/><br/>I still can't figure out the plot of this movie, something about being set up in some Latin America banana republic, shot in Brazil for ""authenticity"". How or why seems unimportant but there is this not so bad stereotyped banana republic dictator who is a pawn of a stereotyped CIA/mercenary type played by Eric Roberts. The poor script tried to show that the bad stereotyped banana republic dictator wasn't so bad, just a tool of the always bad CIA man. But in the end that wasn't very apparent either.<br/><br/>But here is a revealing scene. When Rocky and Jason go there to do some re-con and meet some femme fatale contact, the stereotyped banana republic dictator's daughter, they are taken prisoner then do some very savage knife and gun fighting to get free. There is an obligatory chase scene through the stereotype Latin American town to the pier where their seaplane is tied up. The femme fatale refuses to board the plane to escape but our two boys do. When they fly off there are about 50 soldiers on the pier shooting at the plane taking off, I guess in revenge for the duo savaging about 20 of them earlier. The plane gets aloft, then Jason climbs into the nose of the plane while Rambo pilots it and he comes out halfway out this little hatch in the top of the nose exposed to the air blast. Then we see that there is 4 machine guns in the plane's nose so Rocky banks the plane so Jason can fire the guns & mow the soldiers on the pier down, almost winging Rambo's new love, the femme fatale. Duh, like wouldn't it make more sense to hook those guns up to a remote trigger and have a sight inboard so the pilot can aim & fire while flying, just like they have been doing since late World War 1? They finish that scene off by spraying the dock with the plane's fuel and burning up the survivors when they fire the all purpose flare gun at the dock.<br/><br/>it just goes on and on, mass violence where none of his team even gets winged. Oh one more scene, one of his team, played by equally brain dead Lundgren is a rebel and goes over to the other side. He tries to off Rambo in Rambo's 50's hot rod pick up truck but his 9mm bullets from his submachine gun won't penetrate the armored windows or body. You'd think Dolph, since he hung out there in the tattoo parlor/garage too, would know that his boss's truck was armored plated, so use a better gun.<br/><br/>There is no redeeming value at all to this flick, even the cameo by Willis & Arnold is all talk in a church. It is just a lot of ultra violent gore and mayhem for overgrown boys with nothing intelligible in between. It is an utterly comic book movie because the source material is, guess, a comic book!"

However for me this movie did not gel what-so-ever! There was so humour/comedy in it that just made me cringe. I had to fast forward parts because it was so embarrassing. Like when the generals daughter walks into the 'bar' and sees Sylvester (who by the way needs a voice transplant). I mean this movies lead roles are acting as though they are in there prime. When they clearly aren't. Eric Roberts was such a bad ""baddy"". lol. His acting made me laugh! Seriously couldn't they find someone to play the part at least half decent? Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis shouldn't even have made an appearance! There was no point! or they should have got some 'not known' actors to do those roles! <br/><br/>Such bad Rubbish acting and most of the lines these people came up with are was just plain pathetic. Sylvester looked old and shrunken with his pecks up to his neck! Dolph was just an embarrassment! Enough said! Terry Crews was a disappointment but then again he wasn't meant to be one of the lead players, so can't say much.<br/><br/>The only thing I enjoyed was the two fights Jason Statham was in & one of Jet-Li's fights. The script was written for younger actors not actors that are past there 'sell by date'. There are many older actors out there playing respectable lead roles that suit them. I think these people need to start doing the same! 60 year old's acting as though they are tough kick-ass action guys made the whole film cringe worthy! & the whole concept of Sylvester seeing a girl old enough to be his grand daughter and within 10 minutes asking her to leave with him (forgetting the little children on the Island) just made me want to punch the TV! It was unrealistic and the actors were way too old for this kinda job! <br/><br/>A HUUUGGGE disappointment!"

","Jason Straham is the only redeeming thing about this movie. I felt bad for him. Obviously, he wants easy money and more recognition. He looks pained throughout the whole movie - or is that look one of guilt for having agreed to be in it? Perhaps he had a clause in his contract that the movie could not be shown in his native land? I generally like action films, and understand pop corn films. But this was just awful. Stallone cannot write a decent script - and since he directed and produced the movie, it's his fault. Over the hill action stars - Bruce Willis, Mickey Rouke (who I have never found good), The Govenator, Arnold, of course, Sly himself.<br/><br/>Some over the hill athletes refuse to retire - same can be said about these actors. Cheesy, predictable, unrealistic, and those are the good qualities. Yechhhhhh."

About 20 minutes of solid action where only devil knows who is who because of constant close-ups and shaking camera. After i left a theater, i found myself asking people around me : ""what was that whole thing about?"". Bunch of misfits with combat skills taking over a dictator? Yes. Naive and simple. ""What more to ask from a good action flick, right?"" - several replied. I don't know, but i was going to see The Expendables after watching Rambo 4. It too was naive and simple, although it looked realistic. That was a movie that showed gruesome reality of war and how people were forced to react to it.

ALL the fight scenes are filmed way to close, and it is distracting from the otherwise excellent fights. - same goes for the number of cuts. If Steve Austin fights Stallone, I do want to see the fight, and not at seemingly two cuts a minute. Let the choreography work, this can't be done at this speed. - The CGI is very visible and unbelievable in some. I don't know if it is intended but it counts as bad in my book. CGI'd blood is a sorry excuse for lack of mechanical effects. - The testosterone level in unison with the one-liners may feel pathetic or funny to your audience. Maybe it is meant to be both, keep that in mind.Thank eighties action movies for that ;)<br/><br/>All in all, they could have nailed one of the best action movies for me, but they kind of went off half baked."
"supernma","6","13","28","14 August 2010"," Could have been great, but....
","I had some major problems with the film. I understand it was supposed to be a loud, fun, kick'em-in-the-""rear""-n'-blow'em-up good 'ole time, but it was lacking two key elements: a decent script, and some kind of coherent camera-work/editing.<br/><br/>The story was uninteresting. The plot was sort of just strung together from one action scene to the next with interludes of ""check-your-watch"" macho dialogue nonsense. The jokes and one-liners mostly fell flat (for me, anyway); this was one of the most disappointing factors. If the zings and jabs had been pulled off properly, the film's overall quality would have spiked, but instead it just felt stale and lazy. Ultimately, I didn't care about Stallone or any of the other Expendables; I didn't care about the girl, or the general (and their barely existing subplot), or who was ""effing"" over who. So, despite all of the explosions and blood, I felt bored (especially in the agonizingly bland first Act, although it picked up in the middle and through the climax).<br/><br/>Shaky, poorly-lit frame + quick-cut editing = disorientation. This style of filmmaking needs to die. It's like the camera operator was just throwing the camera up and down all over the place and then the editor went at it like a 5-year-old trying to cut out a snowflake. It got to the point where I just didn't care what was happening on screen. If this style and 3D are the future of action cinema, then I might as well tear-up my Regal Crown Club membership card now.<br/><br/>In short: the film had two fatal flaws, but would have been very good if not for those major misteps. The best thing I can say about the film is that it was amazing to see all of those 80's action legends on screen at the same time (and to see Stallone and Lundgren at each other's throats again; it made me want to watch Rocky IV)."
"gregisroark","5","14","31","15 August 2010"," Not Very Strong
","To summarize this film: Tons of knives, guns & explosions, mildly satisfactory acting, and strained actors in fight scenes that are covered up by quick edits and scores of CGI blood splatters. It was fun to a degree, but it wasn't a good movie. I felt that the acting was attempting to be more serious (stress the word attempting) in a movie that's anchor was a death count. It had more kills than all 4 Rambo's combined. And the plot... where was it? Why was Mickey Rourke in this film at all? So he could deliver a pointless emotional scene that was supposed to support the storyline but in fact the storyline went nowhere."

","This had the potential to be a great movie. Every big name action star was in it - Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jet Li, Sylvester Stallone... the list goes on. Packed full of explosive action scenes, how could this be anything but a winning formula? The answer: an egocentric director.<br/><br/>This movie is written by, directed by, and starred in by Stallone. He is the main character and the only one to get more than a modicum of screen time. He's the hero who kills everything, saves everyone, and gets the girl. His co-stars are delegated the back seat in all this and are atrociously underused.<br/><br/>The story doesn't even make sense. It's just action for the sake of action, with no real reason or plot development behind it. In one memorable scene an entire mansion/castle gets (intentionally) blown up. Why? The bad guys are outside - it doesn't achieve anything. Prior to this the main characters are laying the explosives which just get slapped around anywhere, and again you have to ask yourself, what for? That isn't a structural support, that doesn't destroy anything important. Why not put the explosives on, say, the munitions bunker? Or under the troop carriers? But no, then Stallone wouldn't have an excuse to blow up a building.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is just an excuse for Stallone to make himself look great on screen (it didn't work). The pyrotechnics is used in lieu of plot, and the co-stars barely get an opportunity to show off their talents. It's all about Stallone, Stallone, Stallone, and it's just an utter failure."

","Between the mumbling, ridiculously gross graphic violence, and the awful acting, this movie is not worth the price of admission. The characters were not well fleshed-out. We learned nothing about who they were, how they became a team, or anything. Jet Li started to share at one point, but that never amounted to anything. The only character we saw with any sort of a life was Jason Stratham, and even that was minimal, or depressing. The dialog was lame. Why does no one thinks that the audience would be grossed out by Mickey Rourke's drooling? I couldn't even watch his ""touching"" scene where he explains why he is a tattoo artist now and not out killing people too. It started out OK, although a little gross. This movie is proof that Sylvester Stallone is beyond his prime. He is as hard to understand as he is to look at. Maybe a rental at best."
"IgiS","4","12","26","21 August 2010"," Stallone Stallone, What Have Ye Done
","First of all this is coming form an ultimate Sly's fan, so it is so much harder to come in terms with what I'm about to write.<br/><br/>I was literally psyched for this movie.I went and seek any info about it during post production, I was looking for any possible picture, sneak peak etc.<br/><br/>But unfortunately after seeing this cinematic mess I have to say that it is one of the worst Sly's films altogether. I know that it was suppose to be throwback to the 80's hence the simplicity and gore, but it cannot ever excuse the chaotic character of this movie.I mean, every scene is like separate film in itself(especially of course infamous church scene-which could've been good if it wasn't so sloppy and mediocre).When you think about it, individual scenes are so independent from the whole picture, that if you'd tell this story backwards it would play out the same way(Dolph is good Dolph is bad Dolph is good, action in the palace, action in the car/warehouse, action with the plane, action with the pirates- so what?nothing comes out from anything).So it was not very good movie for Sly director/screenwriter, so what about Sly actor? I'm first to praise this man for his unique physic, even more so at his age, and it was great to see him in shape for this, but somehow in the movie he doesn't seem very comfortable, and I can't remember when the last time I've seen Stallone so downcast(maybe in Get Carter or D-Tox).<br/><br/>The action itself wasn't too spectacular, with short fights, too fast moving camera, and too noticeable CGI around the end. Even though it is promoted by all those big names(and not every one is so big-Randy Couture, Steve Austin)besides Stallone and Statham rest of the guys, each has barely few lines in the script. From the whole bunch Lundgren was the one standing out, and there was this one great scene from Mickey Rourke(like from another movie). Also you can say that Tyler's score is not bad, and there was nice cinematography here and there.<br/><br/>In overall what we've got from it is a show off from few of our beloved action stars in something that tries to resemble movie but like Arnold's character in it - it is not really up to the task."

","I am a really big 80's-90's action movie fan! One of the only ones around of my age! I think bringing up a movie like this is great to re-live those great times, which I greatly miss and I'm sure all the fans miss!! These actors changed the movie industry for ever and they deserve a big congratulations for that. I rated this movie a 9/10, but as I state in the summary, it could have easily been a 10/10. One of the biggest let down of the movie, in my opinion, was Steven Seagal not joining the cast! I know Stallone invited him and he refused, due to problems he had in the past with Producer Avi Lerner, but I must say if Seagal was part of the cast, this movie will get an easy 10/10! Another thing I disliked was Schwarzenegger's attitude! I understand he's now a politician and a politician's work is not a joke (not that I'm considering the movie industry a joke, but less serious), but I think Schwarzenegger should have appeared more in the movie, as he was up there with the best in the 80's-90's and we all miss him!! Van Damme's absence didn't really affect the movie, in my opinion, as I have never been a big fan, although I do recognise he was a big star of the time. Other than that, I think Stallone deserves a big applause, for doing what we were all waiting for and that was to relive the 80's-90's era, just one more time!! Congratulations Stallone and to all involved!!!"
"alexandermarch","10","6","11","21 November 2010"," Damn, it is fantastic movie of its genre.
","So, basically all good things about this movie people already wrote but I was wondering what people wrote in negative review about this movie and it is shocked me... I understand that all these reviews based on personal opinions and experiences but still people who gave this movie the low/lowest rates are ridiculous. Firs of all some people complain extremely too much. From the trailer you can already see what this movie is going to be about; it is not comedy, drama, porno, horror or some kind of futuristic-fantastic movie, etc. It is good old fashion action pack of the 80's-90's...There is no deep romantic conversations, there is no super unpredictable twist, there is no time for exploring and reveal deep each character, it is movie which goes straight to the point with good sense of humor...Those of you who LOVE rap and hip hope music, can't complain that rock or heavy metal don't have bit because it is ridiculous, it is different genre. The same thing here, if you don't like old action movies or one of your first action movie was spider man or batman then don't post negativity here because you simply too shallow to understand why Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis show up in this movie for a few moments. For me it was like sentimental memory of all old action movies which I watched with those people playing inner and I think it is extremely good to see them in Expendables. I really missed Van Dam and Steven Sigal in Expendables as well. I wouldn't mind to see Van Dam or Steven Sigal in this movie as some kick ass sales persons or authority for at least a few minutes.... I mean, come on we all grow up (I believe I mostly talk from men contingent) on the action movies such as, Commando, Rambo, Rocky, Die Hard, Universal Soldier, Leather Weapon, Under Siege, Bullet and on, on and on...Yes there is not all actors from those movies but spirit and genre are pretty much the same. Here, we have incredible cast of the action heroes of 80's and 90's and plus we have action heroes of 90's-2000's and somebody complain that this movie isn't good enough. Really?! Only just for the cast I give this movie 5 points. I watched 2 times this movie in movie theater!"
"zetes","7","6","11","22 August 2010"," Big and dumb, but it delivers exactly what it promises
","Sylvester Stallone enjoys his old age Renaissance with this amusing throwback to the cheesy action movies of the 1980s and 90s. It's dumb as Hell, and very poorly directed (by Stallone himself), but it does pretty much deliver. Stallone and Jason Statham lead a team of mercenaries, which also includes Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Terry Crews and some other tough guys. They're hired by Bruce Willis (who appears in one scene alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger) to infiltrate an island nation and assassinate the bloody general who has taken it over (David Zayas, who co-stars in the show Dexter). Stallone discovers that the general is really unimportant, and that the real villain running things is Eric Roberts, with former professional wrestler Steve Austin his second in command. Stallone doesn't really want to get involved in this crazy business, but is ultimately inspired to go through with it because of a rebel woman he meets there (Giselle Itié). The plot doesn't make a lot of sense, but there's a lot of explosions and beatdowns. It delivers what it promises, even if I did forget that I even saw it by the next day. Mickey Rourke has a nice small part as a former member of the Expendables, and Charisma Carpenter (of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel fame) has a nice part as a chick who dumps Statham."
"imagiking","3","11","24","27 August 2010"," The Expendables: A Blustering Flurry of Disappointment
","Sylvester Stallone and I have long held a very rocky and uncertain relationship. His early material (the first two Rocky films, First Blood, even Paradise Alley and F.I.S.T.) exhibited a man with talent and cinematic know-how beyond his gruff and mumbling appearance. The mid 80s saw the beginning of a seemingly never-ending whirlwind of generic action hits (even managing to affect, and almost effect, the Rocky and Rambo franchises). A modern day revival (beginning perhaps with Cop Land and reaching a breathtaking zenith with Rocky Balboa) boasted to my surprise that Sly could still hold his own in the cinematic ring. As such, I had high expectations of The Expendables. Could this be Stallone's way of apologising for his previous indulgences with a proper action film?<br/><br/>An elite group of professional mercenaries, The Expendables find themselves tasked with removing a tyrannical despot backed by a rogue CIA agent. Struggling with problems both within the team and without, leader Barney Ross is disinclined to accept the mission until the determination of a local young woman inspires him to help out those who truly need it.<br/><br/>As I said in the overly long introductory paragraph above, Stallone has shown in recent times that he can not only still act, but can direct in a beautiful and effective manner and create enticing and rewarding stories. The Expendables is his first effort in applying this second wind of creativity to something entirely original; not based on a previously explored character. From the get-go, the stripped down and unglamourised violence which characterised 2008's Rambo is seen here, again used to steer the tired genre back to its early roots. The first scene exhibits some misplaced and ineffective humour, including some barely vagued digs at Stallone's age. Once we are introduced to the characters, we begin to be assailed by one-liners, genre cliché, and some woeful acting. Randy Couture displays the on screen charisma of a furniture shop, bizarrely being given the bulk of a scene (and a very poor one at that) to carry despite has lack of talent of any sort whatsoever. Twenty to thirty minutes in comes the long awaited scene for which the film garnered much of its publicity: Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis sharing the screen at last. To call it a disappointment is an understatement, the barrage of pitiful dialogue and rapid-fire ""jokes"" making the doors seem ever more appealing. Thereafter we launch into the main section of the movie, more of the same: relatively decent action; astoundingly awful dialogue; standard genre techniques. A blustering flurry of disappointment and despair, made even worse by the occasional line or glance which seem to showcase an actual film struggling to make itself known beneath the layers of well-trodden stereotypes. A scene featuring Mickey Rourke describing his reasoning behind retiring from the group is the paragon of these moments, Rourke's genuinely breathtaking performance by far the best thing to be seen here, albeit entirely wasted. One cannot help but think The Expendables may once have had some potential, a thought which engenders much lamentation given the eventual extent of its mediocrity. And, as if we needed further flaws, no main character is ever harmed at all, and we get a happy ending gearing us up for a sequel. Oh, bother.<br/><br/>Although I desperately wanted to find a good film within this, and gave it every chance to present itself, The Expendables leaves a bitter taste of disappointment and a feeling of betrayal. Lacking any innovation or originality, wasting opportunities all around, and delivering dialogue to make ears swell up, it simply fails. Though I will commend its action sequences, better as they are than most modern films, it's just not enough."

","""Speedracer"" and the ""Transformer"" movies, even the second ""Charlie's Angels.""<br/><br/>These are silly or even bad films by the conventional measures. This is too. It is vapid, misogynistic and fundamentalist. I wouldn't recommend that anyone go unless they know themselves well enough.<br/><br/>But like those other movies, there is a lot of cutting edge filmmaking craft in this and I enjoyed it for that reason alone. I think there must be some separation from Sly the image and Sly the filmmaker. I surely — for example — admire the effectiveness of cable TeeVee demagogues at the same time I find the effect vile.<br/><br/>There are three notable things. <br/><br/>There is a neo-Kurosawan notion of planes, even in the fight scenes. Here is a sophisticated example: The film starts with Sly checking out the mission and deciding to not follow through, abandoning a woman to rape and torture (torture by the way by waterboarding). As in all his combat movies there is a scene where he pensively encounters his conscience and decides to do the right thing, turning into a killing machine for justice. The setup has Micky Roarke in the close foreground giving a story about how he is cursed by not having saved the life of a woman. (What he is doing while giving the speech is cool. The speech itself is pure formula, but the fact that he is painting flowers on an old guitar for a woman who has left him is sweet. He plans to smash the guitar when finished.)<br/><br/>During the scene, Sly is in the background out of focus. This is not the way Akira would do it: he would and back and use a telephoto so both would be in focus. Welles talked about compositing two shots with multiple focal points. But here Sly is blurry; he is further away than he would be in reality. We shift to a closeup of Sly as he meets himself and comes to his decision. It is a closeup. His face fills the screen, but he is still out of focus. What they did was crop the shot to zoom in. It takes a craftsman to even think of this and the cinematic effect it gives. And how it mitigates the worst part of any Stallone movie, that turning point, because he just cannot act. So the camera does it for him by setting planes.<br/><br/>Throughout, we have muted colors, lots of shadows that swallow the scene with piercing lights. This not only makes the thing Eastwood-moody, it allows for strobes and shadows to animate the battle scenes. They are done well if you can allow for the macho silliness and magical powers.<br/><br/>And for every key sequence of scenes, we have a sliding three dimensional camera. Christopher Doyle has changed the world of the eye, bless him. There is a seaplane that glides and swoops like seaplanes do. The camera emulates these movements after showing them to us, and continues throughout much of the movie.<br/><br/>Bruce and Arnie make fools of themselves.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

I thought, yeah, Silvester did an awful job on Rambo IV, but maybe this time he hired people to show him a thing or two about directing. Maybe the guys who accepted to act in this movie wouldn't sign up for any lame production.<br/><br/>I thought Silvester had two options for a movie like this. Option A: a huge, epic action movie- one last stand with all they got. And then, after killing a lot of bad guys, despite all the wounds and suffering, our guys show that the true spirit of the action hero never dies and will never be forgotten. Option B- a clever, well-written movie with nice jokes to bring a nostalgic atmosphere.<br/><br/>So I went to the movie theater, sat there and waited to get sucked into the last ""glory ride"" of my childhood idols. But nothing happened. The story was so poorly told, the scenes were so terribly shot that one can't actually get into the movie. I couldn't go like ""yeah, let's go get the bad guys!!!"" Arnold's appearance was of pure commercial purpose, and the whole scene with him, Silvester and Bruce Willis- just terrible. It drags you out of the movie, into the CNN news update or something. 2 hours of fighting where you can't quite see what's happening, because of the so terribly shot action scenes- kicks and punches flying at short range, guns shooting in your face. Jet Lee is pathetic, he gets his ass kicked all the time, and so on, and so on...<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but I can't seem to enjoy the way Stallone tells the story. Robert Rodriguez would have done a lot better with both action scenes and story-telling.... And do you know what Sly failed to remember from his 80s action hero carrier? That in every milestone action movie our hero is not the toughest nor the strongest. There was always someone bigger and better than him, who kicks his ass. At the end, though it's not the muscles that win the day, but the true spirit and perseverance of the character. The 21-st century Vin Diesel style action (""I'm the baddest mother f****r, who kicks everybody's ass from the beginning to the end"") is something Sly isn't known for. That is why in my opinion the movie isn't as dramatic as I would like."

"randy-377","4","10","22","23 August 2010"," A Botox of a Movie
","Some men buy hot cars when having their mid life crisis, some men make movies. In this horrific homage to the brutal close-up and an America that doesn't exist, Stallone has fashioned a movie that is so thin on substance and excessive on violence, it is at best a fairy tale. This movie could have been titled, Cliché, because that is what it is at every corner. Stallone must have seen the movie, 300 and liked the graphic splattering of blood, because you see it so often in this film you wonder if he's not being slightly ironic. And why he decided close-ups of every aging hero was interesting is nothing less than bewilderment. Yes, Mickey Rourke gives a three minute speech with a close up of nothing but his lips, but the speech is flat, detached, despite the close up (what else?) of tears on Sly's famously botoxed cheek. This is one of those movies we Americans like: we always win, we never get shot and we ALWAYS teach our enemies a lesson. Somewhere in the back of one's mind, we're thinking, they can't even find bin Laden and yet this little group infiltrates and basically destroys a government...if only. But it is really the excessive, meaningless violence that is most troubling. There is no regard for human life in the slightest here. Men are killed on the average of three per second. It's not interesting violence. Its not martial art eloquence, or supported by any kind of romance of violence, its dirty, bogus, badly photographed violence that leaves one running for silence later."

","Combines all of the maudlin sentimentality of the Rocky movies with the mindless violence of the Rambos. The phrase that best describes this movie is, ""Yeah, Right!"" A bunch of mercenaries who have obviously seen one too many wars are paid to rescue the crew of a ship captured by pirates. After laser-targeting all the pirates, they proceed to try to talk them into surrendering instead of taking care of business. (YR) Then, they risk a life-or-death fight with one of their own to keep him from hanging one of the captured pirates. (YR) When they get stateside, they are contacted by a supposed CIA Agent (Bruce Willis) along with the leader of another group (Arnold Schwarzenegger)who appear in cameo roles for about five minutes, and asked to overthrow an island dictator. Ross (Stallone) and Christmas (Jason Statham) scout the island with the help of a beautiful contact who is, guess who, the dictator's daughter. (YR) Of course, Stallone immediately falls in love with her. After almost being captured for stupidly scouting the palace, they escape in their seaplane, which turns into a fighter plane with hidden machine guns. Of course, Statham must climb into an open cockpit in the front of the plane to operate said machine guns, but what the hey? They manage to blow up an entire pier full of bad guys, of course missing the two baddest.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, their former comrade (who wanted to hang the pirate) turns on them and sells out to the bad guys. He battles Stallone and Jet Li, and is finally shot by Stallone.<br/><br/>Well, of course, the girl stayed behind on the island, and Stallone must go back and rescue her. Of course, all his team goes along for the comradeship and love of adventure only, since they've turned down the contract. (YR) The five of them manage to blow up everything and kill everyone in rather spectacular fashion. Several times we see Stallone ripping off 8 or 10 shots in about 2 seconds from a .45 Automatic. (YR) Of course, for his climactic duel with the baddest guy, he whips out a Colt Single-Action Army (YR) with which he fans six of the best into the villain just as Christmas throws a huge knife into the villain's back, which penetrates him completely, with about 4"" sticking out of his chest. (YR) They then fly blissfully home, where they are met by the former comrade-turned-traitor who, it turns out, wasn't fatally shot after all, and with whom they reunite with open arms. (YR) Like I said, ""Yeah, Right!"" Frankly, I was hoping for some tongue-in-cheek violence, with Stallone maybe parodying his Rambo flicks. Just got another Rambo with help."
"Dillypogo","5","10","22","17 August 2010"," More Cobra Than Die Hard
","I think it's fair to say that Sylvester Stallone is living in the past. Back in the day when men were men and guns were bazookas, Sly was running around a jungle, building intricate booby traps with a bunch of sticks and blasting away psychotic gunmen in grocery stores. He was an all-out action star, one who epitomised the popular gritty, muscle-bound flicks of the '80s, and he's never really left this mind-set.<br/><br/>His last film, 2008's Rambo, was a return to his beloved roots, playing the famous Vietnam veteran once again, appeasing most of his testosterone-hungry fans. I wasn't one of them. It was bloody, it was brutal and it was actually a bit boring, or at least it was for me. However, it seems that the 64 year old liked the familiar taste of the now-outdated genre and has decided to attempt a loving comeback for it, bringing together the very best action heroes working today for its primary cast, including Jason Statham and Jet Li. Steven Seagal can suck it.<br/><br/>The Expendables stars Stallone as Barney Ross, the head of a group of professional mercenaries, consisting of Lee Christmas (Statham), Ying Yang (Li), Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and Toll Road (Randy Couture). How they came up with these names, I don't know.<br/><br/>They're on a mission to take down the evil dictator of the fictional South American country Vilena, General Garza (David Zayas), who unflinchingly kills people and has a big mansion and is just a fat, foreign bastard with a Craig David beard. Turns out he is not their only target, as crooked ex-CIA agent James Munroe (Eric Roberts) is the well- dressed controller of puppet Garza's strings.<br/><br/>As expected, this is all leading up to an eardrum-bursting, vein-popping 20 minute long finale filled with gigantic explosions, erratic gunfire and beefy men angrily shouting at one another. There's even a moment where Couture watches a man roast in flames and runs up to punch the poor burning guy in the face. I mean, holy hell.<br/><br/>It all sounds epic and, occasionally, it is. But to be brutally honest, there's not much separating this from the sleazy, straight-to-DVD fair you might see in a bargain bin at Blockbuster. I don't intend any disrespect to Stallone, he clearly has a lot of admiration for the genre and he has fully displayed it here, but the end result is less than satisfying.<br/><br/>First off, a lot of the editing in the action scenes is all over the place with about ten cuts in just over a second. It's like Transporter 3, where the action sequences - the most important aspect of the action genre - are murdered by frustratingly frequent edits, rendering them near incoherence.<br/><br/>They're also filmed in the style of shaky cam, a condition where the cameraman seems to be suffering from Parkinson's disease. Made famous by Paul Greengrass with his popular Bourne flicks, it's headache-inducing and I certainly don't remember this being an aspect of '80s action movies. So I have to wonder why Stallone decided to film The Expendables in this spastic way.<br/><br/>Likewise, his script, written alongside David Calllaham, is rather patchy, containing some weak writing with irritating clichés. These clichés may be deliberate, but that doesn't stop them from inspiring an eye roll. Saying that, there is the occasional one-liner worthy of a giggle. After blasting some bullet holes into a recently interrogated traitor, Roberts proclaims, ""Now we can see inside of him...and I see lies."" There's also a part where Lundgren stomps on a dude's face and simply says, ""Insect."" Genius.<br/><br/>One of the most prominent features of The Expendables is, of course, the glorious cast, crammed with muscular action stars. Most of the film's focus is on Stallone and Statham, who both work fine on their own, but are lacking in chemistry when on-screen together. Stallone may not have much in terms of a personality other than ""he's the leader"", but he's acceptable. Statham has his usual, natural charisma at hand and he uses it to the fullest, yet the two don't quite mesh together.<br/><br/>Lundgren is marvelous, with his character turning to the dark side not long into the film, making for a memorable baddie role. The main villain, Eric Roberts, isn't a terrific one - all he does is wear tuxedos, smirk and act like a total ass - but he does what he can with the role.<br/><br/>Aside from Jet Li (who has a dandy hand-to-hand fight with Lundgren), everyone else feels underused, a common symptom of an ensemble cast such as this. Crews and Couture don't do anything until the finale, and even then, they don't do much. What could have solved this would be to remove the subplot of Statham's cheating girlfriend - which doesn't go anywhere at all and is simply a useless time filler - and insert more scenes to develop these characters.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is a fabulous actor, undoubtedly the most respectable name in the cast list and his talents shine bright in the three scenes he's in, the second of which contains a heartfelt monologue about heartbreak on a past mission. It's a shame he's not used more, because his performance momentarily lifts the film sky high above the punch-punch, bang-bang of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel that The Expendables' vast potential has been squandered. Stallone had the opportunity to do something spectacular, but what we've ended up with is a bit of a convoluted mess. There are too many characters, leading to many being undeveloped and the '80s action vibe isn't enough to hold it together. Some fans may find gratification here, but I didn't. For me, it was more Cobra than Die Hard. And Cobra sucked."
"EddyOne","6","10","22","14 August 2010"," Not as good as expected
","I cut right to the chase: You expect the that THE EXPENDABLES will be an 80s style action flick. Lots of action, stupid plot, explosions and macho one-liners. While you get a hunch of all that, THE EXPENDABLES fails by presenting to many characters who don't have anything interesting to do at all. Also the action scenes, or basically THE action scene, since the whole second part consists of the grand finale whereas the first half is utterly boring,okay so the action isn't choreographed or filmed in the 80s fashion. You have fast cuts, shaky cam, confusing camera angels and lot's of CGI blood. Some fights are just wack. The fight between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren is one of the worst Jet Li fights of all times. Basically all the hand to hand actions sucks a lot. Another thing that I really didn't like are the many bad one-liners, and I don't mean bad in a good 80s trash-way bad, I mean bad as in ""not funny, you try too hard""-way. The infamous Schwarzenegger, Stallone and Willis Scene was painful and awkward. This has got to be one of the worst cameos I've ever seen and just proves what's wrong with this movie. If you can't come up with a more funny or clever way to bring up those three action giants on one screen (even if it's only for a couple of minutes) then you lack some talent or are just lazy. The whole movie feels like they knew exactly, that everybody will be amazed about the cast that they didn't have to put their heart in this. The unused potential of this flick is ridiculous. <br/><br/>Of course though the movie is entertaining and I can't hate too much on a movie, that blows up so much stuff and shows people getting ripped apart. But the fact remains, that this ain't in no way as good as it wanted to be, the same way as Rambo IV was in no way as good as it's predecessors."

"Quinoa1984","5","7","14","21 August 2010"," for a dumb, 80's-inspired ULTRA-violent action movie... it could be better
","You'll get what you expect when you go see The Expendables. It's just one of those movies: if you're expecting it to be a non-stop action extravaganza with (almost) every big action dude, large or small, from the past thirty years, you'd get that, but if you're expecting it to be a big steaming pile of stupid action movie-ness taking from the dumbest of 80's action movies (at least in ""plot""), you'll get that. For me, and I don't think I'm entirely alone- you may think different looking at the message board and whatnot online, but just look closer- it's in the middle. It's neither a triumph nor a failure. It has such a cast that it makes it impossible to dislike, if only on guilty pleasure grounds. But it also doesn't really have the kind of gusto to take its BIG status and do something really interesting with it.<br/><br/>The Expendables rides on its mega-action, which includes much ULTRA-violence, but really the people who will be most psyched will be those wanting to see the cast blow ***t up real good. There is some of that... maybe TOO much of that, but hey, what can you do when Rambo: First Blood Part 2 and Commando are the main influences. But the movie, as enjoyable as it can be, has its share of problems. For one thing, the villain(s) can't rise to the occasion. One of them, Eric Roberts, is a slimy guy who can't grow poppy on the ground that the General/Dictator of a small island in the Gulf controls- that other guy (David Zayas of Dexter) is also a kind of good-bad guy. You get the sense if the Expendables didn't come back to kick ass and, uh, kick more ass and blow ***t up real good, the two villains would take care of themselves, regardless of the factor of the General/Dictator's daughter.<br/><br/>But yeah, cardboard plot: Expendables get assigned to take out a General on an island, his daughter is the contact, they get spotted and need to leave, she stays, Stallone feels guilt leaving her behind, brings back the guys to get her back. Beat for beat, this is just the story, with a few surprise appearances (Schwarzenegger, Willis) - that is, if you haven't seen the torrent of TV commercials that hype up Ah-nuld to be the main star with Stallone, when it's simply a walk-on. Sadly, his scene is one of the highlights in an otherwise decent but lacking action picture. There is bang for the buck, but it's such a cartoonish-numbing buck. The combination of drama and action that one saw so strong, at one time, in Rocky or First Blood, is much more diluted, much more concerned with such frenetic action - to the point, I should add, that it dulls the senses. The fast editing is far from the kind of pacing, yes, from even those 80's action movies. It's more Bourne than Cobra.<br/><br/>Again, the actors, when they're effective, do do what they can. Dolph Lundgren, of all people, gets to shine in a character that, as written, is kind of confused as to his allegiance. Mickey Rourke gets a couple of great scenes, even if he doesn't get full camera-eye-line. But for the most part other supporting actor people, like Terry Crews, who one has really admired as of late, get only a few moments here and there. Oddly enough Stallone's character is given the least to do, except to sort of reprise his last conflict in 2008-Rambo (going back to save the girl, yada-yada). Statham has a quirk with his girl, and Jet Li is short. Randy Couture (yeah, does okay with little as the one least-known in the cast) has some ear tick. And Stone Cold Steve Austin (yes, Stone Cold) is just a heavy.<br/><br/>I really did go into the Expendables hoping to have a good time. Up to a point, I did. I had some laughs. I felt like cheering once or twice. Other times I just got annoyed by, oddly enough for a movie assuming to be ambitious with its cast, how lax it is. Its one big BANG is to keep the violence and explosions going for twenty minutes at the end. Dumb action movie violence is dandy, even if it's repetitive and unimaginative after so long (hey, again the 80's). However, bad CGI blood plus bad editing plus no plot and dialog that is just barely puncho and overly macho, turns into something that is kind of unpleasant. It met somewhat the expectations, and at the same time I wonder how long it will linger in the mind. 5.5/10"

","I really wasn't hoping for much here. I like a lot of the actors in the movie and at the very least just wanted a little reminder of '80s action movie fun. This movie failed on almost every level.<br/><br/>You've got some gun play and some fights, but a lot of those classic shoot 'em ups were great because the plots, while not very complicated, were straight forward and made you hate the villain(s). The writing here is just terrible and that's even by action movie standards. You've got way too much concentration on Stallone and Statham. I thought this was going to be a great ensemble effort. Instead you've got a lot of decent choices either not doing much of anything or only showing up in spots. <br/><br/>The jokes are just awful. They reek of a writer who's not funny but desperately trying to be. Many of them are really forced. Also there are MANY one liners in this movie that make absolutely no sense. They're not cool or funny, and if you just think about the situation they're used in or the sentence that came before them you think ""Huh? Why did he say that? It makes no sense.""<br/><br/>I liked Eric Roberts but he didn't have enough screen time for me. The colonel (played by Angel from Dexter) wasn't convincing at all. Not that he really had a chance to be. Right off the bat without much proof we're supposed to believe he's a tyrant. We hear things about why he is but everything's been established about him before the movie even starts and the audience is basically just taking the film's word for it. Show don't tell, duh. Looking back it would've been nice to cut him out completely, focus more on Roberts, and just tighten everything up by going in a different direction.<br/><br/>I think they really missed the point of what they set out to do with this movie. Just make us feel like we're watching a decent action flick from the '80s. Simplify the plot, make the villain evil as all hell, and give us a reason to really root for the hero. This was maybe the only movie in history where they could've just completely ripped off other films of its kind and people would've been perfectly okay with it! Instead it just seems like an incredibly lazy effort that could've been short, sweet, and great piece of nostalgia. It was like after they got the cast together (which was good, not great) they just mailed it in, even more so than a lot of the schlock from the '80s that's way better than this turd."
"Aaron1375","8","5","9","26 November 2010"," Guess what? There is a lot of violence and explosions in this one!
","Yeah, I am being rather sarcastic, anyone who could not figure this one was going to be explosive most likely does not watch all that many movies. In the end, I have to say it was a good movie, about what I expected. A team of mercenaries is hired to assassinate a general on an island in the Gulf. Things are not as they seem though as Sylvester Stallone's character feels bad that the daughter of the general did not leave with him and his buddy as they did a reconnaissance mission before the entire team left for the island. The action is really good, my only real complaint is the use of computer gore effects instead of the good old blood packs and other nifty tricks to make the mess a bit more splatty. Sylvester, Jason Stathan, Jet Li all do a rather good job, wish they featured Li a bit more considering he is one of the top billed characters. The best performance came from Dolph Lundgren. He is not the best actor or anything, but in certain roles he shines and he does so here as a member of Stallone's team that gets kicked off because he is becoming to unstable. The rest of the cast is good too and it was fun seeing Arnold, Bruce and Stallone together in a scene...most likely the last time that is going to happen so even if their scene was a tad pointless in some ways it was still fun. Stallone has shown a real knack for bringing back the hard action movie of the 80's and he does a good job here. If he just used real blood for gore effects I would have given it a nine."

","""It means that if you're invited to a party, and you don't show up...it doesn't matter."" <br/><br/>For Stallone's eight (official) film as director he has signed up most of the biggest names in old school action. But as much as I like to believe he did this as a love letter to the (superior) R-rated action flicks of old, I can't help but think he did it mainly to cover his ass by appealing to a broader range of people and widen the target audience. I like Steve Austin and Randy Couture, but do they really belong in a film with the likes of Dolph, Arnie and Bruce? <br/><br/>Story-wise, it's sort of a cross between The Dirty (half) Dozen and Delta Force 2. Which is weird since although the aforementioned Chuck Norris movie is several rungs down the ladder from The Expendables, it had a better plot and more coherent politics.<br/><br/>Stallone's script (a writer called Dave Callam is also credited, but since Sly took the story far away from his original draft it's basically a courtesy credit) is his most superficial to date. Barely anything is explained in any detail beyond ""shoot the ethnics"". That's all you need to know, and certainly all you get. The bad guys are drug dealers, and all of the footsoldiers are willing to die for their paycheck. Since the US government won't officially intervene they sent ""The Expendables"" to do the job for them. Only I never really felt like they WERE expendable. There's no exploration of their own finite existence or their acceptance of inevitable death.<br/><br/>For a film with six main characters a 103-minute running time is a joke. I am seriously hoping that there will be an extended blu ray since there's hardly any time to build character. You'll remember none of their names, the whole cast can just be referred to by the actor names and their reputation as action types. The only character out of all of them who has an arc is Dolph's Gunner Jensen. An arc for Stallone, Statham or Li? Forget it.<br/><br/>The action is good, and gory and not afraid to be a hardcore R. But the Expendables are not exempt from the modern style of action editing and bombarding us with dozens of quick-fire shots per second. It's disorientating and annoying, and for a film that proclaimed to be a throwback to the good old days (when action was clear and visible) this was a bad editing choice.<br/><br/>Stallone has the skill and intelligence to make good movies, but he aimed just a little too low when making the Expendables. I still have faith that he can deliver a superior sequel and I urge you to see this over any other junk out at the movies right now. Support the R-rated action movie, damn the PG-13 wannabes."

I love that Stallone is bringing together these actors to show people what true action movie is supposed to be like!<br/><br/>Screw the so called ""movie critics"", they are just a bunch of pretentious fakes who won't criticize the pointless violence in ""no country for old man"", calling that ""artistic"" and ""in-depth"", but willing to spat on ""heoric violence"" in films such as the expendables, which in my opinion, has far more value than those so called ""artistic violence"".<br/><br/>Nuff said, Stallone rocks! I hope he will make more films in many years to come!"

","Commando, First Blood, Rambo 2+3, Die Hard, Terminator, Scarface, Lethal Weapon. What do all these films have in common? They're all 80's action flicks. My relationship with these films is a very love/hate one. The ones with a plot, action scenes that relate to the story and have a good flow are enjoyable. Then there are the likes of the Rambo sequels which have a non existent or a very generic plot, contain explosions, bullets, random senseless violence and more explosions and just bore me to death. The Expendables was supposed to be a revisit to the past of the 80's action genre. Which route did they take? As you might have guessed by my rating, it's the latter.<br/><br/>The story. I'll try to explain what little of that I understood. A bunch of random dudes (played by popular actors) like to shoot bullets and blow stuff up. There's an evil ruler in Vilena who they have overthrow by doing what they do best i.e destroying everything. Later they find out that there's an evil ex-CIA American who's backing the dictator up (why is he evil? God knows...) so they have to take care of him too.<br/><br/>This movie pretty much throws every single 80's action cliché at your face without being charming or nostalgic. The evil foreign dictator, his daughter who disagrees with his methods, the guy who betrays the team (obvious since the first scene he's gonna do it), the crappy punchlines and catchphrases, the East Asian comedic relief, the token black guy, explosions just pushing people away, bullets never hitting the good guys and many more.<br/><br/>OK, so perhaps you're thinking 'It's a cheesy 80's popcorn action flick. Enjoy it for what it is'. Well, there's a problem here. The action scenes are not exciting at all. They're scattered all over the place. The smallest thing will ignite a long, boring action scene. 'Hey, that guy looked at me funny. Let's kill him and start a huge fight with everyone around us'. And, the creators of this movie decided to jump on the shaking camera bandwagon which is beyond annoying. Just imagine, Jet Li doing martial arts while the camera is shaking like there's no tomorrow. Sounds retarded, no? It worked in the Bourne movies, Shooter and a few others because it added intensity. Why? Because we actually cared for the characters. Over here, they could blow up any second of the film and I wouldn't give a crap.<br/><br/>There's nothing more left to say about this film. The characters are stiff, the story makes no sense, the action is stupid. This can be safely added to the legions of crappy shoot em ups. The only intense thing about the whole movie was the somewhat well composed music."
"VideoGameHollywood","1","8","17","4 September 2010"," Expendables Review... in short Really Bad
","Can you remember any of the characters names or even the plot itself. This is what I felt right after seeing this little gem of a movie. Now lets get things straight, I was really looking forward to seeing this film. A movie with the greatest action stars from the last century was sure to be a bloodbath with unforgettable lines that I would be quoting till I was 70. Unfortunately, this was not the case.<br/><br/>Even from the opening scene, the movie felt like a B grade thriller with horrific camera angles and cut up action scenes. I really don't need to see 6 different angles when someone is punched. Stallone clearly needs some help when it comes to directing. Every dialog shot was so zoomed in, that you had no idea where they were, or for that matter what was going on. Almost every shot only showed a characters eyebrow to their chin in frame while they recited there so-called lines. Its hard to believe this movie was so disappointing. I really enjoyed Rambo and don't understand how this movie went so awry.<br/><br/>But of all the problems with The Expendables, the biggest problem was the pace of the movie. This movie moved so fast, just one setting after another in a matter of seconds. I would say the longest scene in the movie ran for 5 minutes, than BAM back in South America or some random location. I have never scene such terrible editing, if you can call it that. It was just bunch of scenes smashed together and deeming it a movie. Im sorry Stallone, but you really let me down on this one.<br/><br/>Overall Rating = F-<br/><br/><ul><li>VideoGameHollywood.com</li></ul>"

The jokes are terrible and cringe worthy. The special effects are cheap and nasty. The lighting boring. The dialog is ridiculous. In fact the whole movie is ridiculous and non-sense. Was Sylvester Stallone on crack when he wrote this? The holes in the plot are so large that Arnie could drive his Humvee through them. There is a serious lack of continuity in the plot, It just doesn't make sense. The fight scenes were stupid and badly shot. <br/><br/>Was this movie supposed to be serious or a p***-take? I guess it's a p***-take, because it's so bad, but I thought p***-takes were meant to be funny?<br/><br/>It's a world gone wrong when people think that this film could be considered a ""great movie"".<br/><br/>103 minutes has been stolen from my life, actually a little less, because I didn't bother watching it to the end.<br/><br/>Get off the crack Stallone and retire already."
"Boxcar_Edit","3","9","20","29 August 2010"," Skip it - we walked out
","For all the known names and action there just isn't enough decent dialog or purpose to justify sitting through the weak dialog and copycat plot. We saw really bad ratings elsewhere (besides IMDb) and trusted the higher rating here. We were mistaken.<br/><br/>The concept sounded good, questioning what happens when tough mercenaries get a bit older, what they do on their off time, etc. That seemed like a great twist for an action flic, but the script didn't really go there or do much with that idea. They muse for a few moments about things and then go blow stuff up. Despite the famous names on the marquis this seemed like a repeat of a zillion other movies.<br/><br/>If you *really, really* like action movies this will be an okay, mindless good time. Even being in the mood for this, though, we were cringing at some of the lines and found some of the bullets graphically exploding heads pretty needless. There's just nothing special about the film.<br/><br/>Some scenes were so bad that we went to check for other movies available at the theater. I realized I was missing the film and realized I...didn't care. That's when I consented to a much earlier request to just leave.<br/><br/>As stilted and shallow as some dialog was, it does seem like it matches reality in certain ways and that just might be how some freelance soldiers really relate. The script and actors should get some credit for that. That said, it wasn't worth sitting through."

","Watching this movie was a great experience for an 80's movie buff like me. Its like the advertisement for it says, it has everyone! It says a lot for Sylvester Stallone's toughness that he can still play a tough guy part when he is one year from collecting Social Security. It really tickled me seeing the cameos by Bruce Willis and ""The Governator"". Its sort of an inside joke, he and Stallone have always had a friendly rivalry. Mickey Rourke really steals the show in his few scenes as a former mercenary turned tattoo artist. He delivers a rambling speech at one point about losing your soul that is really oddly moving in a way. Director Stallone has the camera dwell on his battered features as he delivers it. The awesome special effects, loud explosions and familiar faces sort of blur the fact that the plot from this movie could have easily been an old A Team episode. There really isn't much of one. But who am I to quibble? This movie is a great way to round out the summer."
"mike-adly5","7","4","7","8 December 2010"," In a Nutshell: ""The Expendables"" (7/10)
","The Expendables...A humorous action flick, little better than expected!<br/><br/>I guess you only need to look at the poster to know what you're in for. A bunch of tough guys with tougher names who've most been able to carry major action flicks on their sole backs before. In ""The Expendables"" they all come together within an entertaining story about a line-up of mercenaries led by mighty Stallone, who go on a rather rough mission in Latin America; to find a little more than their common day to day action waiting for them.<br/><br/>Despite the long list of big guys, their contribution to the story varies greatly. While the Statham, Stallone duo eats up most of the action, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis make their mere guest appearances. You still, however, get a little bit of humor from Jet Li, some wise man talk from Mickey Rourke and some bad guy acting from Oscar nominee Eric Roberts.<br/><br/>In ""The Expendables"" two time Oscar nominee Sylvester Stallone takes his eighth shot at directing and his twenty second at writing a screenplay. Having the experience in combining both, together with acting, in titles like ""Rambo"" and four of the ""Rocky"" series, Stallone successfully employs each of his players' charismatic characters in their best fit. It reaches a point where if you try to reverse roles in your head you'd think it's impossible.<br/><br/>Like any action flick, you'll get the crazy gun shooting, the wild fist fighting and the anything but real moves from the guys with the big arms. If you're not planning on swallowing ideas like someone grabbing a taking off plane by his hand a hopping on it, then this is not for you. On the other hand, the film is overall quite entertaining whether you're into this kind of things or not; like Terry Crews said in an interview about the making of ""The Expendables"", that it is going to impress everyone that's a fan of genre and even the ones new to it.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, The Expendables is more than just your average action flick; it has an ensemble of Hollywood's most prominent action stars. It's got the eye candy alright and it's got a little laughing to offer as well. It is not a waste of time!"
"brando647","7","4","7","30 November 2010"," Stallone's Action Epic, Shallow but Fun
","Sylvester Stallone has written and directed the most testosterone-loaded film in years. He has brought together action film icons, both young and old, into one big exploding mess, and that's the main draw of the whole film. The story itself is nothing special that we haven't seen before: a team of mercenaries are hired by a mysterious ""Agency"" to infiltrate a Central American island nation and remove a general and his American benefactor from power. Cue the Expendables into action: Barney Ross (Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), and Toll Road (Randy Couture). With names like that, you know the focus of this film isn't the characters...it's the explosions.<br/><br/>This isn't necessarily a problem. Some movies are just the type where you don't feel like following a story and want to watch Stallone take off a guy's head with one swipe of his knife. The action in this film is pretty wicked, particularly a scene where Ross and Christmas are escaping the island in their cargo plane and Christmas pops out through a front hatch to gun down soldiers from the air. Still, even with creative action moments like this, I don't think this movie pushed the limits enough for me. Sure, it was rated R but it didn't always feel like it. It might've been because the majority of the blood spatter in the film was CGI. Whatever happened to practical effects and blood squibs? It helps give an action film a little extra realism rather than using CGI to create blood that just does not look right in any case. There is some graphic violence in the film, but it's never too crazy (with the exception of Dolph Lundgren's warning shot to a group of Somali pirates in the opening).<br/><br/>No worries though because the CG blood isn't enough to ruin the film. It's still a blast, with the mercs trading one-liners while gunning through hundreds of soldiers. The dialogue is cheesy but the action keeps coming and doesn't stop until the Expendables have done their job. I do wish Mickey Rourke had been given a meatier role in the film. I thought he awesome in IRON MAN 2 and was looking forward to seeing him kick some butt here, but he's only given a handful of scenes away from the action. His character, Tool, is one of the most interesting and I hope he has a bigger role in the inevitable sequel (because, let's face it...with $100+ million box office, we're getting another). If Bruce Willis (who has a short, but sweet cameo with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film) has a clear enough schedule, I'm hoping he returns to further inflate the awesomeness of the cast.<br/><br/>Stallone had a moment of genius when he decided to bring all of these action icons together and with some minor fixes, he could have a real action masterpiece. He's off to a good start here and I'm hoping the eventual sequel will be even stronger. If you're in the mood for some mindless explosions at the hands of some of the best action heroes to grace the screen, this is it. Just don't look too deep, or you'll see just how shallow the whole ordeal really is."
"Al_The_Strange","7","4","7","30 November 2010"," Could this be the most macho movie ever?!
","Remember back in the day when action movies were all the rage? Back when Ahnold could flip a car over, spit in a Predator's face, and utter a monotone one-liner to hapless victims before ripping their hearts out. When Sylvester Stallone could sputter some really macho words before blowing away cannibals and punching the crud out of pro boxers. What do we have these days? The action genre is still alive and well with Jet Li and Jason Statham both pulling mad Kung-Fu moves, with wrestlers like Stone Cold Steve Austin smashing their way to the big screens, and with Mickey Rourke taking on Iron Man.<br/><br/>Much like any number of big action films, ""The Expendables"" offers a massive dose of wicked attitude and heart-throbbing action, complete with big explosions, wild gunfights, super-fast martial arts, gnarly knife-fights, careening vehicles, and loads of fake blood. Whether looking at it as a touch of classic action-movie nostalgia or an exercise in modern action choreography, the film entertains all the way.<br/><br/>The film has probably the biggest manliest cast since ""The Magnificent Seven,"" with the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Steve Austin, Mickey Rourke, and Dolph Lundgren joining forces to kick butt. Also look out for a few action-star cameos! I can't say that the chemistry between all these characters really works, but one can't help but to appreciate the loosely hobbled together teamwork they strive for. Collectively, they embody a style and spirit that seems like a form of distinctively all-American heroism.<br/><br/>All that being said, it's still not a great film by any means. The good news is that the photography is generally solid and satisfying; action scenes do look good. The production value is stylish and slick, with decent set-pieces and entire arsenals of cool weaponry. But the film does fall short with its writing and its story/character development. It's as brainless and irreverent as one can expect from an action film (after all, it's not like the stories for ""Under Siege,"" ""Bloodsport,"" ""The Specialist,"" ""The Condemned,"" ""The Transporter,"" etc etc etc were ever top-notch either). You can also expect plenty of absurd and unrealistic moments.<br/><br/>Recommended for action junkies only.<br/><br/>3.5/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 2.5/5, film: 3.5/5)"

","Even for those who are fatigued by the loud, bloody, pyrotechnical messes, and absurd cloned plots of the past few years' thriller movies, THE EXPENDABLES is bound to please. Why? Simply because it is a parody of this genre, with a hilarious script of puns written by director and star Sylvester Stallone (with David Callaham, probably the one responsible fro sticking the story line together). No one really takes this action flick seriously because of the fun the actors are having. <br/><br/>It is reunion time for the likes of Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), knife pro Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial arts pro Ying Yang (Jet Li), rasty renegade Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Toll Road (Randy Couture), and Tool (Mickey Rourke) - collectively called The Expendables, biking through another impossible adventure. The 'other side"" (villains who are destroying a Gulf island include Eric Roberts, Paine (the impossibly huge Steve Austin), the good/bad puppet General Garza (David Zayas form 'Dexter'), and the general's rebel daughter Sandra (Giselle Itié). There is a lot of body destruction, firebombing, and breathless chases, and for an action drama it is very well paced. But the pleasure of the film comes form seeing all the famous guys of yesteryear having such a great camaraderie. There are even small cameos for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger! It is a fun ride with a lot of unexpected laughs as these men make fun of their past films and stereotypes! <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"colinrgeorge","4","12","30","24 August 2010"," Epically Awful
","I'm sorry, men of the world, but ""The Expendables"" is a piece of crap. In fact, as a man, I'm a little embarrassed that this putrid, structureless, diarrheic pile entertained a single one of you. Without an ounce of artistry, Sylvester Stallone has essentially created ""The Twilight Saga"" for men, and just as that series caters to a lowest-common-denominator teenage girl audience, Stallone deposits this Cro-Magnon mess for males, simultaneously juvenile and out-of- touch.<br/><br/>The suffocating machismo of it all makes it tough to pick a place to start. First, the film is hideous. On a technical level, many of the shots are out of focus, smearing the ugly greens and browns into a muddy pastiche. The rest is soiled by awful CG that completely undercuts the entire eighties aesthetic. I'm trying hard to think of something less conducive to an action throwback than a half-dozen rifles with animated laser-sights firing bullets that spill digital blood—No luck yet.<br/><br/>Even forgiving the film its bland palette, cinematographic shortcomings, and near total lack of practical effects, ""The Expendables"" misfires on the single most obvious ingredient for exciting action—Compelling set pieces. It takes place, almost in its entirety, on a small South American island where there is a dock, a palace of some sort, and apparently nothing else. Those backdrops set the stage for some dismally choreographed shootouts where, despite the exotic locale and 80 million dollar budget, ""The Expendables"" maintains a consistently amateurish feel.<br/><br/>And for a movie positively brimming with A-List (or once A-List) action personalities, how about some personality? Ultimately, it doesn't even register that Stallone assembled such a dynamic ensemble—There isn't a single distinct personage among them. Sure, Jason Statham likes knives and Stallone prefers firearms, but that's about where the definition ends. Anyone could have played these nobodies, and it reduces what should be the film's sole distinguishing feature to mere stunt casting.<br/><br/>Regardless, there isn't a flaw I've illuminated that would hold water if the film was even fun, but ""The Expendables"" is truthfully one of the most boring of the year. Call me desensitized, but I can only see so many torsos explode, so many fatal stabbings, and so many explosions before I start to yawn and check my watch. Action only works when there's something at stake, and Stallone does his best Michael Bay impression in his flagrant disregard for that simple storytelling truth.<br/><br/>Nothing is ever at stake in ""The Expendables."" Ever. Not one of the many protagonists is placed in even momentarily convincing danger, and with almost no story to back up the dreary killing, the action loses all dramatic impact. Stallone's assembly line slaughter has neither the gravity to make us care nor the creativity to make us squirm—Unless we're squirming out of anxious impatience.<br/><br/>I'm not an idiot. I realize ""The Expendables"" is more ""Grindhouse"" than it is ""Rambo,"" but it fails even as a disposable homage to eighties action. It might be a class reunion of sorts, but it's the kind where you end up sitting around talking about expired memories instead of making new ones. In recalling the cheesy charm of the decade that made him famous, Stallone could stand to do far more embellishing. He succeeds in making a film with an eighties mindset, but it's a hollow, lifeless effort that completely lacks the charisma that makes those films memorable twenty-some years later.<br/><br/>Conversely, ""The Expendables"" would be forgettable no matter what unfortunate decade birthed it. And yet, here in the year 2010, this is the number one film in America two weeks running—I guess I just don't get it. Everything I go to the movies for, and not just the frivolous stuff like story and character, is completely and entirely absent here.<br/><br/>Men of the world, if this is really what you find entertaining, then consider this my resignation."

","As we all know The Expendables has an amazing cast of Action stars led by arguably the greatest action star of all time and if Stallone isn't that guy the other one makes a cameo appearance. Of course I'm talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger who makes a brief appearance with Bruce Willis in a scene many action fans never would have dreamt possible. My only problem with this movie is perhaps it has too many stars which means each one has too little time to make an impact. Jason Statham gets the most screen time bar Stallone and he is excellent, Jet Li has less impact but has a great fight with Dolph Lundgren who I have to say proves that he really should be on the big screen more often. Stone Cold Steve Austin also makes a fabulous bad guy and the rest of the team get brief chances to shine. Mickey Rourke also shows what an incredible actor he is even with less than stellar script to work from. Stallone really is truly back on top now and I hope that if Expendables 2 does happen he works a little more on the script and story. What truly saves this film is the astonishing last half hour or so of action and that is really what most of us turned up to see. Highly recommended for action fans. 8 out of 10"

He's just a bodybuilder who can't accept that he's old. Sly maybe his nickname but its the quality that is sadly missing from his performance.<br/><br/>He still thinks audiences want comic strip movies about remorseless killing machines.

I would forgive and forget the wafer thin plot, wafer thin characters and bad acting if there had been the following: <br/><br/>1) Good action scenes. There were none. The fist fights were filmed with shaky cam and looked terrible. The gun fights were boring. <br/><br/>2) Effective villains. There were none. They were a pair of pussys and they did nothing. In the latest Rambo Stallone gave us villains that were downright evil, and you rooted for the good guys to kill the hell out of them. You have to love to hate your villains. They should chew up the scenery like wood-chippers, or be cold and calculating. These villains were boring. <br/><br/>3) Good use of the actors. Jet Li was wasted because he manage to kick only one person to death. Jason Statham was boring. Stallone was boring. Mickey Rourke had a couple of good scenes but he's barely in it. Arnie and Bruce were in it for about 90 seconds. Good use of Stone Cold as a henchman. Your character's don't have to be deep, but they have to be likable.<br/><br/>4) Cheesy one liners. There were none, at least none that are in any way memorable. <br/><br/>5) Ridiculously heroic death scenes. There were none. In a man-on-a- mission film, which this was supposed to be, you need to kill of some of your heroes in really over the top and heroic ways. In this film not even the guy who died actually died. They called this film The Expendables. If they are so expendable, kill some of them off. That would add a bit of tension. <br/><br/>6) Tension. There was none.<br/><br/>7) Big, bad set pieces. There was one, in the stone corridor near the end. Jet Li kicked a man to death, and Terry Crews shotgunned people into paste.<br/><br/>Give me all that, and I will have a blast. Give me nothing, and I'll call your s**tty movie out for exactly what it is... a s**tty movie."

This film however will make up for all the guys who had their significant other drag them to the Twilight movies. Take her to this flick and regain some of your manhood, but don't expect a thinking man's flick, and don't let on to your Twilight loving significant other that you didn't like the movie.

If you are expecting a movie that will touch your heart and affect your personality, go watch ""Beauty and the Beast"" animation! Haha..anyways..that's the problem when entering a movie house. Just a suggestion, expect nothing else when watching a movie. Also, if you're not a fan or know nothing with the history of the actors, please better shut up. 'Coz you know what?

Even though he doesn't have an Academy Award for Best Actor, he is still one of the best actors that lived and revolutionized the Hollywood movies. This is also why he thought of making a movie with the best action stars. This is what we call Passion! So, to make the story short, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this flick to all movie lovers.

I'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised just how really good it was and it's just a fun movie. It does not take itself too seriously (which is good) and I really have to disagree with what some critics say. I seen a lot of people say the directing was not good, there is some excellent camera shoots, for example the shaky camera on opening scenes, the bit where the cameras tilts upside down and an excellent shot with Statham flying low in a plane over an island.<br/><br/>Plus in this pc friendly pg 13 world of movies, its refreshing. Yes thats right, unlike so many films of late (Bourne,Die Hard 4, A Team etc) there is swearing, violence and there's barely any cgi. The fight scenes actually look like people are getting hurt, and sometimes some of the baddies pose an actual aura of threat. Good to see Stallone back, way better than Rambo and he actually splits up the action for the main players perfectly.<br/><br/>Go see it, and I'll leave it on this note, if you happened to get captured would you rather Jason Bourne try and rescue you with a rolled up news paper, or would you rather Stallone have a go with a massive knife and machine gun.

"tarbosh22000","8","8","19","13 August 2010"," The Ultimate Action Movie For The Fans!
","The Expendables is the most macho movie ever made. From the metallic-looking credits on down, the screen pretty much oozes testosterone.<br/><br/>Barney Ross, Lee Christmas, Yin Yang, Toll Road, Hale Caesar, and Gunner Jensen (Stallone, Statham, Li, Couture, Crews, and Lundgren respectively) are an underground A-Team of sorts who go all over the world doing the hard jobs that no other teams of mercenaries will do. When it is discovered that evil South American dictator General Garza (Zayas) is a puppet for rogue CIA agent James Munroe (Roberts), the team are sent in to clean up the mess (i.e. create a bigger mess by creating countless deaths and explosions) by a mysterious man named Mr. Church (Willis).<br/><br/>When Barney falls in love with the dictator's daughter Sandra (Giselle Itié) and she is kidnapped by the Munroe's goons The Brit (Daniels) and the very imposing Dan Paine (Austin)... get ready to party like it's 1986 as The Expendables hearkens back to the glory days of action cinema. Even Stallone's vehicles (car and plane) are reminiscent of the classic Cobra (1986), as are Garza's soldiers. Roberts plays the slimy Munroe with aplomb. He gets the classic final villain speech we all want to hear. Let's not forget our favorite governor Arnold: He is basically the comic relief with his jokey cameo and prerequisite funny name (Trench). It would have been fun to see Willis character to return one more time to angrily bellow ""This wasn't part of the deal!"" or some line like that but sadly, that is not to be.<br/><br/>We're so used to seeing these faces on the small screen, it was a real treat to see them in the theater. They truly deserve it. Eric Roberts, Dolph Lundgren and Gary Daniels in the same scene? Oh yeah! We also get to see a one-on-one fight between Dolph and Jet Li for the first time ever. And Gary Daniels vs. Jet Li and Statham. In the theater! The pairings of all the different fan-favorites is pretty mind-boggling. Of course, with an international cast such as this it becomes hard to understand what some of them are saying - when Stallone and Li talk it's hard to understand, and when Couture talks you don't want to understand. But to counteract his Dale ""Apollo"" Cook-style delivery, we have Mickey Rourke on hand as the token ""good actor"" who gets a heartfelt monologue. For a movie with so many characters, it was very well done how each got a nice backstory and it never got confusing at all.<br/><br/>God bless Stallone - he couldn't have delivered this at a better time. What the world needs now is more tough, take-no-prisoners action. Not more sissy junk involving ""facebook"". This movie is the antidote to ""Eat Pray Love"". To quote The Simpsons, this is more like ""Beat Slay Shove"". Another good thing about the movie is it has no stupid kids or teenagers. When Jason Statham is the YOUNGEST person in the group, we get mature, professional action. Stallone is known for giving his characters funny names and here he really goes to town. You thought Driven's Joe ""The Hummer"" Tanto was funny...He also includes another of his trademarks - ripped from the headlines topicality. Like the plot of Rambo III (1988) involving Afghanistan, here we have Somali pirates and a clear analogue to crimson-shirted cretin Hugo Chavez.<br/><br/>If there is a downside to The Expendables, it is the use of CGI. CGI sucks and it takes away from the old-school feel we love. It's not entirely dependent on it, but when it was there, we felt it was unwelcome.<br/><br/>Back in the golden age, any one of the cast members could have sold a movie. It is a sad comment on movies today that it took a ton of producers and EVERY major action star just to get the project off the ground. How can they top this if they want to do it again? It has all the clichés we know and love, just on a bigger scale. Abandoned warehouses, neck-snapping the villains, the line ""we've got company"", exploding guard towers and many, many more. The first 20 lines said by our heroes (and throughout the film) are fun clichés and soundbites. This isn't a complaint. Perhaps a certain appreciation for action movies is needed to truly understand what's going on here. Anyone who trashes this movie simply doesn't get action movies or their significance. They should go back to poking Twi-hards on facebook, or some such moronic twaddle.<br/><br/>Truly a movie for the fans, The Expendables delivers the goods with a once-in-a-lifetime cast. See it!

I am a fan of gory, foul-mouthed action movies, but this just did not deliver.<br/><br/>Stallone was boring, his face looks melted and so was his character's personality; melted into one big vat of awfulness.

","This is one of the worst action movies I have ever seen in my life. I grew up watching Schwartznegger movies, so I know a horrible action movie when I see one.<br/><br/>These men, let me correct that, these senior citizens, need to retire and never make a movie ever again. It will be interesting to see what kind of non-human creatures Sly Stallone and Mickey Rorke turn into as time goes on. Its so obvious in this movie how messed up their bodies are in real life. People in their 60s are not suppsosed to look like they do. I don't even know how to describe them. Those two have cut and lifted and filled with plastic every inch of their skin, injected tons of steroids and HGH and god only knows what else. Their is no way they live another year or two - Oh, I'm sure they will be alive, or at least animate, but ""alive"" in a human sense? I seriously doubt it, at least when that happens Stallone will have an excuse for the ridiclious way he talks.<br/><br/>I have no idea what this movie was really about, and neither do any of the people who made or were in this movie.<br/><br/>Randy Couture - The only person involved with this movie who is worthy of respect. However, I respect Couture as a man, and as an athlete, but not as an actor.

"sascha-17","5","7","16","28 August 2010"," Sadly, an expendable movie
","Let me start with two caveats: 1. I watched the German-dubbed-version of the movie 2. My seat wasn't that great (fourth row from the front), which probably exaggerated the annoying quick cuts and shaky camera-work.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting great story-telling or even a great action-flick like ""Die Hard"". What I did expect from ""The Expendables"" was a celebration of dumb-but-cool 80s action flicks. Say ""Commando"" with better production values. Sadly, the movie doesn't deliver that. It's more like the dumb-but-bad 80s flicks à la ""Stone Cold"". Read: Too self-conscious and too concerned with creating a set of oh-so-cool characters. I mean, come on: A bunch of guys in their 40s/50s and 60s living/working in an ""MTV meets Ed Hardy""-style garage, riding around on custom-bikes when they're not off in some foreign country to kill terrorists? Even back in the 80s that would've been a stupid setup. What's wrong with the classic premise of having a bunch of retired pros who are driven out of retirement by a strong incentive (tons of money, unspeakable injustice, challenge by a former ally turned traitor, loved one(s) in despair, etc.) and reluctantly go on one last mission?<br/><br/>But my main gripe with the movie is its lack of good writing. There's not one memorable line that stuck with me, and I just watched the movie two hours ago. If an action-flick is highly quotable, it's usually a good film. You know, stuff like ""Yippi-ky-yay-motherf**ker!"" or ""Let off some steam"" or ""Consider this a divorce"". No one-liners of this caliber are uttered in this show, but then again, see my caveat number 1.<br/><br/>The ""serious"" dialogue (Mickey Rourke's terrible close-up-speech) seems forced and stapled on, none of the characters are even vaguely fleshed out. Yes, I know they're all tough bad-asses in a no-brains-all-testosterone movie, but even these kind of characters need *some* background to make me care enough about them - and to explain their motivation to go out and mow down baddies by the dozen. Even the mercenaries in ""Predator"" were less cartoony than the Expendables - and that says a lot. Two or three of the team aren't really introduced at all and are missing for the entire second act. Plus there's no real arc in the story. At no point do our heroes seem really threatened or likely to fail, and none of the good guys die (or even get tortured). And what's their mission again? Not that I cared much after a while, but in a straightforward action-movie, the goal of the heroes should be equally straightforward and plausible. <br/><br/>The villains were underused, not properly introduced and didn't get their deserved showdowns. Plus they weren't nearly evil enough. They're action-movie-villains for cryin' out loud. As such they *should* torture innocent farmers, mutilate little kids and/or their dogs for breakfast and rape nuns/missionaries/ophaned teenagers by the dozen. Rambo 4's gruesome showdown only worked so well because the movie showed the incredible atrocities of the Burmese military in such gory detail.<br/><br/>One of the villains in ""The Expendables"" even survives his ""death"" and is welcomed back to the team by the end of the film, even though he betrayed them. Now that, according to 80s-action-flick-rules, is a strict ""no-no"". A traitor has to die a horrible death at the hands of the hero. Anyhow: I'd rather hire Bennet from ""Commando"" as my evil henchman than any of the thugs in Expendables.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the action-scenes. Yes, there's plenty of them and the gore-factor is rather high (sadly not as high as in the excellent Rambo 4). Problem is that when the action starts there's almost too much of it and it's filmed and cut in a way that you can't really follow what's going on most of the time. Plus the big showdown takes place at night and on a location that isn't really shown to us beforehand. So we never really know where everyone is in relation to everyone else. If you hated the car chase in ""A Quantum of Solace"", you probably won't like much of the action in ""The Expendables"".<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a film about a bunch of aging warriors doing what they do best, a movie with cool dialogue, good action scenes and a healthy amount of blood, go and rent ""The Wild Geese"" - just fast forward all scenes with that annoying kid. That old flick is a lot more entertaining, better written and a lot more believable than ""The Expendables""."

","Well after watching this movie I came to the conclusion that this movie didn't offer anything interesting or had very good story line.For me it only passes for the action(and we are all bored with those things today maybe it would be awesome in the 80s maybe? ), and fails at dialog and story. Positives:It was funny to see Bruce ,Arnold and Stallone in one scene in a movie.Nothing else to add here. Negatives: The back story of every character was very dull.To take the character story of Lee Christmas (Jason Statham ).As it's shown his relationship with his girlfriend was very empty and was drawn in to scenes.The first scene didn't had anything breathtaking or it had some emotion.As it progressed the most dull part of this was the second time when he beats the ex-boyfriend in-front of his girl.That was so cliché and would write it someone like- Sylvester Stallone.Next the story of the Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) was so simple and there was no acting there.He saved the girl cheers on him, at least some romance there or more emotion? There was little time spend on the other characters.I admit there were some funny scenes added but they don't make up for the lacking creativity and acting in this movie. Well If you like action movies with a lot of boom and bang, good guy saves the day and blows the hideout, I recommend you to see this movie. I think there was more to be added to this movie to make it completed."
"davideo-2","4","7","16","23 August 2010"," A mouth watering offer that just falls short of being awful but is a far way from perfect
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Sometimes, a film comes along that offers so much on a plate and sets itself up to meet so many standards, that surely the result can only possibly be absolute perfection or one of the worst disasters of all time. In this case, and certainly for this critic, fans of 80s action movies and the stars which have retained an unwavering fan base to this day, namely director/star Stallone and some fellow relics, and some relatively young blood in comparison. In terms of star power, certainly, for the discerning action fan, The Expendables seems a mouth watering, irresistible prospect, with so much talent on display that together as one may be expected to deliver more than maybe on their own. Stallone is in on what he's presenting, a knowing throw back to the ultra violent, mindless, trashy action classics from their heyday in the 1980s. No one with an inkling of knowledge on these most guilty of pleasures would be expecting or looking forward to anything more than an undemanding slice of entertainment, which they could sit back, switch their brain off to and enjoy. In other words, no one should actually have expected too much of The Expendables in the first place. The sad thing is that it fails on this most simplest of counts, managing to fare as neither one of the worst films of all time or an action classic. Just an instantly forgettable mush that leaves no real mark at all.<br/><br/>The suitably apathetic plot has Stallone as Barney Ross, leader of the titular group of soldiers called in to risky situations, who finds himself approached by a mystery man to head to the South American island of Vilena to overthrow a seemingly power mad dictator, only to find he and his team may have been pawns in a game by the CIA to take out a rogue agent (Eric Roberts), who believes having power and money gives men the right 'to act like the a$$holes nature intended them to be.' Everything fails to go to plan, and the team retreat from the island, only for Ross's love of a woman there to tempt him to return there and save the day.<br/><br/>I don't mind that it's dumb. I don't mind that it's contrived (Stallone and co. bursting in just as some soldiers are about to extinguish a cigarette on his lady love...) or that it's predictable. I just wanted it to be fun, and this is sadly where the movie fails. For all it's blood splattering, shoot outs and cool explosions, it's shot in a turgid grey lens, and the humour fails to flow (despite the scene where Stallone meets Arnie and Bruce, and cracks about being president are made!) Stallone appears suitably bulked up, but his face is showing the signs of time, despite any surgery he may have had. It's nice to see Dolph Lundgren on the big screen again, but he has very much a supporting role here and his character fails to make any real impact, ditto Mickey Rourke after his recent acclaim for The Wrestler. Jet Li doesn't appear to be speaking English as well as he can, and Roberts is a weak, cardboard villain. Jason Statham delivers the most out of all, and his more charismatic presence would have been better served in, well, a better film.<br/><br/>This ends up coming off like the recent Righteous Kill, where all the hype of De Niro and Pacino being on screen together failed to live up to expectation. If Stallone had got this gang together maybe as recently as ten years ago, the results may have been better. As it is, it's showing the wear of time worse than it's stars. **"

Don't get me started on the film's use (or misuse) of Jet Li. It was like watching a B-movie with an A-list cast.

","Let's be honest for a second. After seeing the trailer of this movie, you know straight away that you won't go to see it for its deep philosophy. <br/><br/>I wanted action and boy was I served! It's a basic action movie, all you need to know is that they are bad guys, and there are good guys. I take a second to mention that the good guys team is made out of all the action movies bad asses of this last decades, no less. Nobody cares about the details – even though the plot hold its own and there's some depth in the characters (they do have the brains going with the muscles), the point is - and that's the only thing there is to expect – for the good guys to kick the crap out of the bad guys. And that's exactly what happens.<br/><br/>It's an excellent action movie; the violence is raw and blunt, the close range fights are very well choreographed; there are explosions here and there, some jokes which made me laughed good-heartedly because they were so 'out of the box' (it's not easy to be green :P). Our heroes give punches but they take a lot of them too which is a good thing because it makes them vulnerable. Sly creates a real bound between his characters and we can feel it. We want them to kick ass and they do.<br/><br/>My only dark spot, is the special effects every time blood is involved still got a little work to do there, but it doesn't spoil anything at all.<br/><br/>If you want an entertaining action movie, with guns, *big* guns, knifes, good punches and kicks, explosions then this one is for you. And no you don't have to be full of testosterone to enjoy it (don't have a speck of it and had a very good moment)<br/><br/>And just in case you need a little more incentive, then tell yourself that the movie is worth seeing at the very least just for the extreme pleasure to have Willis, Schwarzy and Sly sharing three memorable minutes on screen together – yes, Sly pulled it off and he did it well.<br/><br/>Pure adrenaline rush, a pinch of humour and a great cast Sly promised an action movie and he delivered."

And Stallone bring me and every single person who has the same thought with me just that.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed every single minute in this movie and to tell the truth, I've never been so psyched about this one. After I came out from the movie, I immediately called every person I know in the world to just watch this. You could find almost every single element of an action movie in this one. From one by one brawl, explosion here and there and even a little bit drama and a little bit funny moment to ease the tension that have been built from the first minute this movie started.<br/><br/>Trust me, this movie worth every penny and I will suggest for everyone that has been a little bit pessimistic with the movie, to just watch for yourself. I know you will love it.<br/><br/>I definitely rate it 10/10. Won't miss the sequel and of course the Blu-Ray for this."
"John-Athens","8","7","16","16 August 2010"," One Word: Overkill
","The plot of ""The Expendables"" is as such: a group of grizzled, joking mercenaries are hired to rid an island of it's dictator. Admittedly, not the most original premise, but it allows actor-director Sylvester Stallone to do what he does best, which is kill. One thing a good action movie needs is catchy names, and this movie does not disappoint. Stallone plays Barney Ross, along with him are Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Jet Li as Ying Yang, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, and Randy Couture & Terry Crews as the double entendre named Toll Road and Hale Caesar. Plus ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin shows up as a henchmen named Paine. Those names are up there with the likes of ""John Matrix"" and, well ""John Rambo.""<br/><br/>Barney and his crew are mercenaries, but act more like a biker gang. They hang out at Mickey Rourke's bar (belonging to his character, not the actor) to throw darts, and shoot some pool in between missions. You don't know much about how they all came together, but that's irrelevant: they kick ass. Barney, their leader, meets up with a mysterious man in a church to hear an offer for a job. This man names himself ""Mr. Church,"" and is played by Bruce Willis. This is the heavily advertised scene between Stallone, Willis, and Schwarzenegger, and it's exactly what you would expect it to be. They trade jabs, and always try to one-up each other. The scene ends with an allusion to Schwarzenegger's real-life. You would have hoped that Willis and Schwarzenegger had more to do, but it was good while it lasted. Maybe their characters will pop up in a possible sequel. Barney accepts the job to take down this island dictator, and his benefactor, played with certain sliminess by Eric Roberts.<br/><br/>""The Expendables"" handles the action scenes fairly well. The impact of bullets and knives are emphasized for maximum effect. There are also a couple of good, well-placed scenes, including ones involving a seaplane, and a car chase with a vintage pick-up truck. The only thing that was lacking was the fight scenes. You'd expect a movie with Jason Statham and Jet Li to showcase their respective talents. Statham beats up a group of men playing pickup basketball, and we're teased with a fight scene between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren, but that's about it. Stallone himself also looks awkward whenever he has to run, but then again the guy is 64-years-old. However, from then on it's about guns and knives. One particular sequence in which Terry Crew's character, Hale Caesar, uses an automatic shotgun to decimate his enemies stands out among the rest. Before, he muses about how difficult it would be for a man to remain calm when hearing the sound of that gun. How right he was. I would like to say this movie stays way from CGI, or what CGI it does use is seamlessly integrated, but that isn't the case. In a couple of shots during the end, the CGI is painfully obvious (pun intended). Also, for a movie called ""The Expendables,"" it's heroes are awfully resilient.<br/><br/>With ""Rambo"" and now ""The Expendables,"" Stallone proves himself to be a competent action director, although he tends to film his actors too close. If a mindless action movie was a sandwich, I would order it: ""light on the plot, heavy on the bullets, with a side of Mickey Rourke,"" and the guy taking my order would be like: ""Oh, you want The Expendables?"""
"Forgotten_Conscience_Productions","3","3","5","6 June 2013"," The Expendables: What do you need to turn a group of 80s action stars into Expendables?
","I've never been a big fan of 80s actions movies. Rambo never interested me, Demolition Man and Cliffhanger weren't even on my radar. I'd seen a few of Schwarzenegger's movies but most of them in his appeal to kids phase until I went back in the 90s and saw a few of his more popular films. Die Hard with a Vengeance was probably the only of the series that really spoke to me for a long time. So it's not as if I haven't seen my fair share of movies from that era but they never really did much for me as films. I never had that ""Wow that was so cool I want to do that moment."" that a lot of filmmakers have with them. Maybe it's because as a child of the 90s I spent a lot of my 80s years watching John Hughes films and the huge swath of comedies from that era.<br/><br/>Yet when I heard about The Expendables, I was somewhat intrigued. Despite my lack of affinity for their heyday they had never really been in the same place all at once before and so I was very interested in seeing what would happen. Not as it turns out enough interest to actually go see the film in theatres. I had enough misgivings about the film to wait until it came out on DVD to see it, and in doing so I realize that I was right. The film, like many of the era these films harken back to, just doesn't have enough juice in it to sustain a whole hour much less the under 2 hours the film actually has. The characters are underdeveloped and some are basically useless plot devices, the villain is basically half-assed and under used, and the only decent story worth telling was given to a secondary character and not followed through on.<br/><br/>Charisma Carpenter and Giselle Itie had the best stories to tell and yet the majority of screen time went to Stallone and his rag tag band of mercenaries who basically spent all their time standing around looking old and shooting people. You gotta do more with your characters then complain and destroy things to keep modern audiences interested and the only two ladies of the bunch provided the depth and emotional honesty necessary to make the extended action scenes work. Unfortunately depth and emotional honesty are not the point of a film like this and so they get relegated to C plot devices when the A and B plots haven't been any more secured then the plan to liberate an island by blowing up a single part of it with barely any of the army which is holding it hostage inside.<br/><br/>What made most of the 80s action movies work was the buddy cop scenario or the damsel in distress scenario, both of which are present in The Expendables but neither of which are particularly well used. You would think with this many 80s action stars in one room who have played out the stories numerous times would know a thing or two about what works and what doesn't work about a film like this and insist on making it better. Stallone in particular given that he is one of the only of the group to win a Best Picture Oscar. But no, the film is a hap hazard attempt to give many of its stars who have been relegated to direct to DVD content a chance to shine on the big screen. Unfortunately they don't really shine all that brightly, if at all.<br/><br/>What do you need to turn a group of 80s action stars into Expendables? You put them in a movie together with a barely there plot and tell them to act like it's 20 years ago.<br/><br/>To check out more of my reviews, go here: http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/"

","I don't get what everyone was expecting from this film. Stallone said multiple times before the release of this film that this is a tribute to the hard R action movies of the 1980's. Hence the ensemble of some of the most iconic action stars of the 80s and 90s being in this movie. Does it have hammy acting? Yes (Although Dolph Lundgren gives a surprisingly good performance and steals the show in the few scenes he is in). Does it have a cliché plot? Yes. But that is what action movies of the 1980s had. <br/><br/>Although I love this movie, there were 2 things that bothered me. One is the Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo. This would've been awesome, but it's ruined by the fact that it was spoiled in the trailers and the dialog in the scene is just awful! Another thing is that a lot of the cast doesn't get a lot of screen time. Everyone except for Stallone and Statham get like only 20 to 30 minutes of screen time. I hope in the sequel they fix this problem because that really annoyed me. <br/><br/>Overall, if you go in with an open mind, you might like this movie. It has its flaws, but overall, it's a very entertaining movie. Let's hope the sequel can fix some of the problems this one had.<br/><br/>8/10"

","What the f*ck did I just watch? Why the f*ck did I pay money to see it? I have no idea. I can't come up with a single good thing to tell someone about this movie. I laughed exactly once and not when Bruce asked Sly and the Gov if they were going to orally fornicate with each other, but when Terry Crews said ""Remember this at Christmas."" That's it, that's the one funny line in this so called ""action packed, fast paced, thrill ride"" cinematic pile.<br/><br/>I knew this movie was going to be marginal at best just from the cast alone. I mean you have Sly who has been in greats like the Rocky and Rambo franchises. Jason Statham has been in some decent flicks. The Transporter (except for the fact that 2 and 3 were absolute crap.) The Bank Job, The Italian Job. This is a worse notch in the belt than Death Race 2000. Jet Li, my god, this guy is a wire foo legend and now he is the comedy relief. Steve Austins movies are so good they go straight to home video and even then no one watches them. Dolph Lungren, what the hell was he in ... oh yeah, Universal Soldier and I Come In Peace...nice resume jackass and tacking this movie on to it will certainly get you a star on the ground. Randy Couture, please god Jesus stay in the ring. We need you in another movie about as bad as we need bed bugs in New York city. Stop it, just stop, please for the love of god stop.

"Apemangalore","7","8","20","13 August 2010"," Provides just about everything that you could want out of a movie like this
","For anyone growing up during the '80's and early '90's, the notion of having a film including all of Hollywood's most legendary action heroes seemed like little more than a pipe dream. So, when I initially heard that Sylvester Stallone was going to be putting together a movie titled The Expendables for just that purpose, I literally freaked out. But does this supposed ""culmination of wishes"" deliver the goods? Absolutely.<br/><br/>One thing that I was worried about going into Expendables was that, despite how exciting the idea of having all of these guys together sounded on paper, the filmmakers wouldn't be able to give each of them the amount of screen time that they deserved. Personally, very seldom did I find this to actually be the case. Perhaps one or two members of the crew could've received a bit more time in the limelight, but on the whole, I thought that they balanced the focus considerably well, without making the whole venture feel like a cluttered mess.<br/><br/>Say what you will about Stallone as a director, but the man knows how to handle action. Not only do these heroes of yesteryear provide the film with such a tremendous sense of nostalgia, but the action sequences, as well as the way in which they're shot, harken back to their time as well, before - and I know that I'm about to sound like a curmudgeon here - action scenes were plagued by the infamous shaky-cam. I won't go into describing how any of these sequences play out, but suffice it to say, it's some delightfully brutal stuff.<br/><br/>Now, as far as the plot is concerned, what you read in the synopsis is Well, that's pretty much it. Sure, there are a few twists and turns along the way, but if you've watched any action hero classic, you'll see them coming from about a mile away. On top of that, I found the main villain to be pretty silly, and a good portion of the dialogue is just hysterically awful. But, admittedly, that's kind of the fun of the whole experience, as I simply looked at it as a cartoon. A very gory, decapitation-heavy cartoon, but nonetheless! <br/><br/>Overall, I got just about everything that I could want out of a movie like The Expendables: sheer badassery. Sure, the plot is paper thin, and the scene involving a couple of cameo appearances felt just a little anticlimactic, but as far as mindless action films go, this one's tough to beat, at least compared to what else we've been given this summer."
"DonFishies","7","11","30","12 August 2010"," Stallone's nostalgic touch makes for a fairly well done action picture
","After undoubtedly helping kick-start the current fascination with bringing the 1980s back to the big screen, Sylvester Stallone has fairly successfully continued the trend with The Expendables. The film, an obvious action movie throwback, follows a group of mercenaries hired to take down a dictator in South America. But, as any action movie fan should know, there is a bit more to their plight than what the group initially expected.<br/><br/>Seeing both The Losers and The A-Team, I was a little apprehensive about what to expect from The Expendables. On one hand, it was a similar film about a rather eclectic group of guys killing everything that stands in their way (albeit, with an added R-rating). But on the other, it was the only one that was merely inspired by other works, instead of outright based on something that had come before it. As well, there is thankfully no revenge subplot to speak of, something the former films followed each other a bit too closely on. With those ideas in mind, it is a bit hard seeing The Expendables as its own distinctive film on the outset. Each film has its own set of balls-to-the-wall action sequences, wise-ass one-liners and quips, and gigantic explosions.<br/><br/>But what sets The Expendables apart, and what is likely its biggest selling point, is the nostalgia factor. Sure, The A-Team was about a group from a beloved TV series. But a few of its original stars merely had cameos in the film. In The Expendables, it is a wild mix of who's who of action stars. 80s stars like Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts and Mickey Rourke are mixing it up with current action stars like Jason Statham and Jet Li, not to mention ""athletes"" like Randy Couture and Steve Austin. And for added measure, two huge action stars from the decade show up in what may be the greatest cameo appearances ever conceived. It is just a shame that the trailers and press coverage ruined what is essentially, the best scene in the entire film (to think it could have been as well hidden as the zany cameo in last year's Zombieland). This cast alone is reason enough to check the film out for the sheer enjoyment of seeing them all mixing it up on-screen.<br/><br/>But sadly, no one outside of Stallone and Statham really gets a chance to really make something of their characters, outside of the one-dimensional archetypes that set their characters up. Li gets at least two great fighting scenes, but is otherwise to crack a few jokes and be made fun of for his Asian heritage. Roberts makes for a great villain, but gets not nearly enough time to truly feel dastardly. Lundgren gets a real dramatic sequence that could have truly made something of his character, but the performance is almost entirely relegated to happening off-screen. Rourke merely has an extended cameo, and looks like he shot all of his scenes in less than a week after wandering off the set of Iron Man 2, makeup and all. You have to expect that not everyone will get a chance to really do a lot with such a big cast list, but it felt like a bit of a copout having so many recognizable people cast in the film, only to do much too little with any of them.<br/><br/>If there is any benefit in having such a huge cast, it is in Stallone's performance. His character is for all intents and purposes, an offshoot of John Rambo. The film plays much closer to his last outing as that legendary character than it does the other mercenary-based films from this year. But instead of being the timid introvert confusing audiences with his ""depth"", he is actually quite great in the leader role here. He plays off everyone well, and the added interactions allow for him to pull off a much more enjoyable performance as a result. Statham on the other hand, is the clear standout of the film, alternating between the comic relief and the genuine bad-ass of the whole film. He steers his role well (even with the needless subplot involving an ex-girlfriend played by Charisma Carpenter), and holds his own against everyone, including Stallone. He has a lot of fun in his role, and he is obviously the best thing about the film.<br/><br/>What I really disliked was the rather horrendous looking special effects used for anything outside of stunts and fighting sequences (all of which are rather vicious, but fairly epic to watch given the fighters). The majority of explosions look horribly CG'ed, and any scene with an extended shot of fire looks like it was painted in as an afterthought. With much of the final battle taking place in and around fires and explosions, you can immediately tell how irritating this quickly became. Much the same goes for the blood, which looks like was all added in after the fact. There is nowhere near the same amount of bloodshed as in Rambo, and even less gritty realism. It just looks all too sloppy on Stallone's part, and seems rather careless. This could easily be chocked up to Stallone making the film seem closer to its 80s brethren than it should, but is still a pretty weak excuse for something that easily could have looked a lot better.<br/><br/>The Expendables is an exciting and explosion filled action romp, but it makes clumsy mistakes that easily could have been fixed during production or even afterwards. This is a hard hitting film that hits so many marks, but falls short of a few too. It is Stallone's best work in the past few years, but it also proves that he is much stronger when acting as part of a heavily emphasized ensemble, as opposed to primarily on his own. Here's hoping we are done with mercenaries for a while.<br/><br/>7/10.<br/><br/>(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"thebogofeternalstench","1","7","17","29 November 2010"," Incredibly depressing to watch
","I knew The Expendables would be bad, but I didn't expect to experience depression while watching it.<br/><br/>Every scene with dialogue is very awkward and hollow. Nothing is funny, even in a bad way, its just sad.<br/><br/>Sly looks as if he skin has been stretched back along with puffy cheeks and to be honest his face looked a bit drag queen'ish.<br/><br/>The scene with Arnie, Willis and Sly is like taboo, like you should never ever see them together in the same movie let alone the same scene, as it just didn't work. You look at them and think, wow, they are old, and this sucks!!!! The actors I felt just tainted their classic old school movies we grew up with. I just felt incredibly depressed seeing them limp along in the $hit fest of a film.<br/><br/>On a good note however, I feel Lungren was the most interesting in The Expendables and I enjoyed watching him. He looked worn but cool. I think he should be in a new movie where he takes the lead role as a psychotic madman, a bit like his role in Universal Soldier.<br/><br/>Jason Statham played the same tw@t he did in all his other movies, the guy can't act, god knows how or why hes become famous. (This is coming from a Brit.) Jet Lee is annoying to watch with his poofter voice.<br/><br/>Its hard to believe these guys used to be big action stars.<br/><br/>A really sad film, a sad experience, and.......I recommend you don't watch it.<br/><br/>Truly terrible."
"TheUnknown837-1","9","7","17","15 August 2010"," if you were thinking of skipping over ""The Expendables"" please, I implore you, reconsider. This is one of the best action films of the summer.
","One of the most highly anticipated movies of the year has been ""The Expendables"" and it's no mystery as to why. Number one, it's a summer action thriller and summer action thrillers are good business. Number two, and the primary reason, is that it has the perfect ensemble cast for an old-school, testosterone-powered, kick-butt action movie. The movie not only stars writer/director Sylvester Stallone, but also big names such as Jet Li, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger himself (albeit in a small cameo role). This ensemble casting was destined to attract big bucks for the box office and it is worth every penny of it. ""The Expendables"" may not be much in terms of depth and story construction, but honestly do we expect or demand that from a movie such as this? I sure don't. And so for me, ""The Expendables"" was one of the most energetic and exalting movies of the year.<br/><br/>I won't go into any real detail about the plot, because the plot is not what this movie is all about. What ""The Expendables"" is about is this: lots of kinetic, heart-pumping action sequences, strong names in strong performances, and satirical one-liners. And it has all of this to our expectations and above. It's not just a one-note, blood-spraying thriller that's grim and depressing. Like ""Die Hard"" it has a certain note of joy and excitement in its attitude. It does not glorify violence and its scenes are torture and persecution are effective. But when it's not featuring shoot-em-ups, it's really one funny satire. When they're not blowing up baddies, Stallone and Statham and the others are usually gathered around a table or an airplane or Mickey Rourke's tattoo shop slamming each other with one-liners often pinned on the actors' physical features and actual lives. A great treat is the cameo by Arnold Schwarzenegger. On paper or with an unknown actor, this scene would have stopped the story. But the filmmakers wield the scene with jokes about Schwarzenegger's political campaign and his acting past as well as Stallone's so that it becomes one of the highlights of the movie. Admit it, wouldn't you love to grow up with friends like these guys?<br/><br/>Does ""The Expendables"" live up to the hype and expectations? I think it reaches them and beyond. Usually one to criticize a movie for focusing more on action and less on story, I took a different approach with this movie and had the time of my life. It's really about just two things: action and one-liners. It has its fill of both and they're both effectively instilled into the film. Stallone, who also directed and co-wrote the movie is really redeeming himself for his sloppier productions in the middle of his career and has created one heck of a swashbuckler. Stallone is also a fantastic action director and the multiple shootouts and car chases in this movie are utterly fantastic. The only gripe I do have is in the final battle, which is long and powerful, there are a few quips I had. Sometimes the lighting was just too dark so it was hard to see who was fighting who or frankly just what was going on. But this is a minor quip.<br/><br/>Before questioning whether my favorite action flick of the year was ""Iron Man 2"" or ""Salt,"" now they have been dethroned and ""The Expendables"" reigns over them. I saw this movie the day right after I saw Christopher Nolan's modern-day masterpiece ""Inception,"" so it has been a great weekend for me. If you were thinking of skipping over ""The Expendables"" please, I implore you, reconsider. You will have the time of your life."

","Thank you Stallone,in the midst of superheroes and 3D hype,films that appeal to mind to comedies that do not generate laugh, you decided to revisit the era where real men reigned. And you achieved it with style and elegance. With your line up of action stars, the movie is surely going to be explosive, but it also delivers in some intellectual levels. Like the control of a big corporation over a area which is not economically strong. This is the statement of a legend who knows his surroundings and all the problems that is there. If we just forget all the factors, we can only sit back and relax and watch mayhem, blood and gore, with Sly in front.

","I saw this when it came out in the theater, and i now own it on bluray DVD. this is Stallone's 3rd awesome hit hes made in recent years. he went away for a while, but he came back as strong as ever with Rocky Balboa, which was surprisingly great and touching. then he brought Rambo back as hard hitting (and as violent) as ever. now comes Stallone's 3rd hit, Expendables. and let me tell you, its got everything you could want: loads of action upon action, a cast of Grade A action stars, hot female lead, great dialog and some truly funny humor. this was Stallone trying to recapture the energy and explosiveness of those infamous 80's action films he used to make (heck, still does) and it does not disappoint. the chases are done very well, the acting is top notch for a film like this, and the hand to hand combat is pretty spectacular, especially considering Stallone's age. he really is a legend, and hes still got it! this was better then many of the other so-called ""action"" movies that are flooding theaters lately, like those terrible Bourne movies, all those TV show remakes, the new Batman's, etc. this beats them all, because it doesn't pretend to be something more then it is: a really bad ass action movie. no silly pretentious rambling monologues, no sappy love stories, no soap opera drama. just plain and simple ass kicking, balls to the wall action, but not without connecting you with the characters. the other great thing is that this is an ORIGINAL. not a remake, not a sequel, not a ""reboot"", a totally original film with stallone. the team mentality is cool here, WAY better then the new A team movie. these guys are the real deal. words i suppose cannot describe how just plain cool this movie is. action stars from this generation as well as the last are all here, all the big names, even a cameo from ARNIE and Bruce! jet Li is hilarious, SO awesome to see Ivan drago back fighting rocky...ER i mean Dolph lundren fighting Stallone once again! Eric Roberts plays the typical skeevy sleaze bag hes so good at, stone cold.....what a MONSTER. this guy is scary, and plays a formidable foe to sly and his gang of freedom fighters. mickey Rourke provides the heart and soul and the movie, with one truly amazing scene where he talks about how he could have saved his soul by saving another's. almost brought tears to my eyes. in short, this is probably one of THE best most fulfilling action experiences in recent years. in a time filled with CGI overload and everything seems to take itself so seriously, here comes a movie that doesn't try to be anything other then a simple giant blockbuster filled to the brim with brutal fist fights and explosions. i hope Hollywood is taking notes here: THIS is how to make an proper action movie, the way they USED to make them. the movie has it all, and i am really hoping the sequel will be just as good, if not better."

I assume 10's are posted by people associated with the movies, because a movie worthy of a ""10"" come along so rarely. ""10"" is supposed to mean perfect people! How could anyone think this is a perfect movie? (how can 99% of all movies be considered perfect?) But the fact that so many ranked it as a ""9"" has me wondering if civilization has officially come to an end."
"billsmorrison","1","4","8","2 February 2012"," Amoral rubbish
","There is nothing redeemable in this film. Bad script, inane dialogue, wooden acting, ridiculous comic book violence – its got the lot. It is amoral rubbish. Given the talent involved it is a criminal waste...and they are making a sequel! The film revolves around scenes of bloody violence where our gung-ho heroes defeat scores of adversaries using fists, knives and guns without suffering as much as a scratch. In between there are clichéd attempts to humanise Stallone's and Stathem's characters but it is clumsy, unbelievable and pointless. It doesn't develop the story, justify their actions or build any audience empathy.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a film about mercenaries, war and the suffering entailed there are much better films out there. Likewise If you want mindless violence.<br/><br/>At least the writer had the decency to curtail the romance between a 70 year old body builder and a twenty year old actress."
"BrianMemphis","4","4","8","17 March 2011"," The Key to this film is the AutoPilot Scene!
","It would be way too easy to write a snarky review tearing down this movie; other reviewers have that covered. In my opinion, the movie is at its best during Statham and Stallone's first trip to the island. It feels like we're in an 80s-action movie and the plot is still setting up. But then things go downhill rapidly.<br/><br/>Digging deeper, for me the key to this whole movie is a scene on the way back to the island the second time. For no particular reason, a shot holds on Stallone switching on the plane's autopilot switch. This shot seems out of place, but upon further recollection it's is a metaphor for the whole movie. The Expendables is what happens when you throw all these action guys together and press autopilot.<br/><br/>Pure speculation on my part here, but I imagine Stallone wanted to create an Oceans Eleven type experience and work with his friends. Not sure if he achieved what he wanted to, but the Expendables is no Oceans Eleven."

","I have never been so disappointed in a movie. I do not even know why I had any expectations of this being good, but I figured there would be some decent fight scenes. I was wrong. <br/><br/>First of all the setup was terrible, but that is nothing to complain about in a movie like this. Something to complain about is that the movie felt like it was just a series of set pieces sewn together with some incomprehensible dialog. The movie made sure it gave each actor something ridiculous to do, with zero character development. For the final action sequences I could barely tell how was the good guy and who I was supposed to be cheering for. Not only because of the stupid quick cuts but also because they all looked like the same big muscled brawlers. I guess the fact that the bad guys had face paint helped a little bit, but not really. <br/><br/>I mentioned that the dialog was incomprehensibly, but even when I could understand what they were saying I could not understand why any human being would say those words in those order. The attempt at one liners were pathetic and when you could understand them they were bad enough that I almost wanted to groan.<br/><br/>I guess one good thing was Statham threw knives and that was kind of cool. The action scenes were not the worse I have seen, but the final one, which was supposed to be the crowning moment of the film was so choppy I had no idea where anyone was or why people were dying. <br/><br/>I am sorry, but Rourke what were you thinking. The rest of the cast I understand what is going on, but Rourke. You have a legitimate movie career ahead of you. Why waste time on this? I could see you trying with some of the dialog, but the lines were just so bad. <br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie to anyone except those who want to watch things blow up and do not care about anything else at all."

"dee.reid","8","4","8","25 November 2010"," ""The Expendables"" - Not so ""Expendable""
","Sylvester Stallone, star/co-writer/director of the 2010 all-star action romp ""The Expendables,"" is living proof that some guys do get better with age. Stallone, who is pushing 65, is still in remarkably well-kept shape in ""The Expendables,"" in which he is the leader of a gang of mercenaries hired by mysterious government forces - a guy named ""Church"" (Bruce Willis) - to overthrow General Garza (David Zayas), a South American dictator who is actually a puppet for a rogue CIA agent named James Munroe (Eric Roberts). That's pretty much all there is to the plot and is really all that we need to know as audience members.<br/><br/>Stallone is Barney Ross, their fearless leader; aging action stars from the '80s and more current action heroes are his comrades. They all have ridiculous names (or aliases? I'm not sure) like Ross's right-hand man and second-in-command Lee Christmas (Jason Statham, who by far turns in the film's most enthusiastic performance); Yin Yang (Jet Li); Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren); Toll Road (Randy Couture); and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews). Helping them out from the sidelines, is Tool (Mickey Rourke).<br/><br/>These guys are all aging old dogs and they know it, but that doesn't mean you should count them out because many of them are all either pushing 50 (Statham, Li, Couture, Crews), or 60 (Stallone, Lundgren, Rourke); they know how to get the job done and have a ball doing it. What we get in ""The Expendables,"" is machismo, explosions, old-dog camaraderie, and more machismo. And the film's two lone females, Lee's main squeeze Lacy (Charisma Carpenter) and a South American peasant girl named Sandra (Giselle Itie), are pretty much left out in the cold although Itie's Sandra does get to exchange some hesitant romantic glances with Barney.<br/><br/>Stallone is proving to be a highly capable director in his own right; like I said earlier, he's getting better with age, rather than worse. (But let's just get this out of the way: each of his films within the last four years are way better than anything he directed while still at the height of his career in the '80s and early '90s.). His legendary comeback film ""Rocky Balboa"" in 2006 is the best film of his so far (and it's my personal favorite ""Rocky"" picture), and ""Rambo"" (2008) was a blood-soaked throwback to his other trademark character. ""The Expendables"" is a throwback to the good old days gone by of the no-holds-barred blow-'em-up action pictures of the '80s and early '90s from which Stallone and many of his other co-stars in the film sprang.<br/><br/>What ""The Expendables"" does best, other than blowing lots of stuff up without a conscience, is getting all these guys together and having a lot of fun doing it. Some of them (namely Lundgren), haven't appeared in a mainstream Hollywood action flick since the early '90s, and that makes seeing them in action here worth the price of the admission alone. And each star has their time to shine on-screen; Lee Christmas beats up a romantic rival on a basketball court; UFC Champ Randy Couture gets a chance to go toe-to-toe with Munroe's right-hand man Paine (WWF star ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin); Lundgren, a black belt in Shotokan Karate, has his big action scene chewed face-to-face with Wushu champ Li; and lastly, we also get to see the famous scene where Austin actually broke Stallone's neck during a fight sequence.<br/><br/>""The Expendables"" is living proof that the days of no-holds-barred blow-'em-ups are not yet gone. Age is nothing but a number, that is true, and it's good to be schooled in how to make a no-conscience action flick from guys who know how to make such shameless action pictures. Stallone is miles ahead of most modern-day action over-directors who have no clue about how to properly direct a shamelessly violent action picture. The biggest gripe here is that Stallone often has way too much going on on-screen, and the chaotic MTV-style editing makes it hard to tell what's going on and is the main thing that goes wrong in an otherwise flawed but bold and shamelessly entertaining and bloody action picture.<br/><br/>And keep your eyes open for a three-way ego-stroking match in a church between Stallone, Willis, and one other action star from the '80s who will have to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>8/10"

The characters were probably found on the pages of some remaindered comic books. The action scenes are Boys own stuff so I have given it 5, but it really is awful in every other respect. Slys acting is sort of Joey Tribiani doing Days of Our Lives. With lots of guns. There is quite a bit of useless padding in the film, the bits with Arnie, Bruce and Micky Rourke.

","After seeing the awful ""Meet the Spartans"" (my friend thought it was hilarious)I was trying to explain that a good spoof movie is so subtle that it takes a different perspective to see a movie (like this one)and realize how much it spoofs the genre while other viewers will see it as a completely serious popcorn-action movie with 80's action stars. All the great stars are there (Sly, Statham, Rourke, Jet. Even Willis and Arnie make a short appearance.) The first quarter of the movie is actually a pretty good interpretation of what mercenaries and they're reason for combat are but this is soon turned on itself in the 2nd quarter when they're pointlessly shooting police and security at the first sign of trouble and blowing up vital communal structures e.g Sly and Statham manage to blow up a whole seaport and dock (when Statham pops out of the front of the plane with a big gun in an almost Wallace and Gromit-esquire fashion) which would be very inconvenient for the locals :/ Then in the second half the film really comes into its own, Explosions are made ,Knives are thrown ,Militia is made into swiss cheese by Terry Crews' small cannon. All the whilst not a single hit is landed on our ""beloved"" heroes. All the action on screen would be able to turn any 12 year old into a mini Rambo with ease. I would imagine this to be great for someone with more simple taste than I. For anyone uninterested in plot details it go's somewhat like this: Sly's team is sent to overthrow an evil dictator, Eric Roberts overthrows the dictator and then Sly overthrows Eric Roberts, claims that it was for the sake of a single woman (wait, wut?) and then the lads all go back to the bar for drinks and have a laugh about the days work.<br/><br/>Go see it if your an action fan but for me it was mostly a hysterical parody of itself with mostly sincere performances in the ""so-bad-its-funny"" way, but hey i haven't laughed like that since funny people.<br/><br/>Real score 38/100%"

Which was one of the funniest parts of the movie. Their attempt to put each other down while out manning each other worked brilliantly and Willis threatening Stallone alone is worth the ticket price.<br/><br/>A slight nag about the film is at the very end some CGI did crop up, in the form of fire. After all the practical stunts throughout the movie including one great Truck chase I was a little disappointed not to see a stuntman in a fire suit.<br/><br/>If this had just been Stallone's baby with a few unknown actors I'd give this film 8/10 BUT the fact we get to see Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Crews, Roberts, Rourke, Danials with Willis & Schwarzenegger punch, kick, stab, mouth off and blow up each other cranks it up to a 9.5/10 for me."

","One would feel that pumping in almost 5 action movie stars belonging to different genres would lead to the creation of an unsurpassable action thriller.

It is a decent action film but hardly comes up to the level given it's star cast. <br/><br/>The movie isn't bad. I mean, if you look at it objectively the film has almost everything a die hard(pun intended) action movie fan can ask for. Over the top stunts, Hunk Male bonding, Decently chiseled Bad guys, good locales and an amazing background score. What it lacks however is that little piece of coherence and polish which separates good movies and great movies in this particular genre.<br/><br/>Now there are a few rules which one must obey while watching such movies 1. Don't look for deep philosophy 2. Abandon all prejudices against clichés 3. Go with the Flow and love the gore.<br/><br/>The Expendables starts with a bang and pulls along till the very end , but the viewer feels a little dejected in the middle segment due to the lack of stunts and also fully furnished action sequences. In fact most of the cast becomes fully functional only in the second half.<br/><br/>The movie takes off a lot of times but loses steam due to an evident failure on the part of the director to balance the screen presence of his key players.The movie gyrates whimsically through it's entire length.<br/><br/>Having said that , I wouldn't want anybody to read too much into it as the movie with all it's follies holds the audience and there are some pretty solid adrenaline rushing scenes . <br/><br/>The camera work is really good and the team manages to use still cameras and moving camera-frames in tandem, thus producing Die-Hard and Bourne effects together.<br/><br/>Given the storyline, the movie couldn't have been made any better than it has been and hence deserves a place on your hard disk, if not for anything else then for the fact that Arnold and Sylvester share the screen for an entertaining 5 minutes in movie history."
"Hellmant","10","6","14","17 August 2010"," Nostalgia Heaven!
","'THE EXPENDABLES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Legendary action superstar Sylvester Stallone stars, directs and co-writes (with Dave Callaham) this action lover's dream featuring an ensemble of most of the biggest names in the genre of the last three decades. Along with Oscar nominee Stallone there's also fellow former nominee Mickey Rourke, former Stallone co-star Dolph Lundgren (probably most well known as Ivan Drago from 'ROCKY IV'), Jason Statham and Jet Li (in their third film together), WWF and UFC champs Steve Austin and Randy Couture, former NFL and extreme sports player Terry Crews and in glorified uncredited cameos (although they're first credited in the adds and trailers) there's Stallone's former business partners (co Planet Hollywood owners) Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Some glaring omissions to the bunch are of course The Rock, Vin Diesel, Chuck Norris, Wesley Snipes (who was cast but had to turn down the part due to his tax problems and could not leave the country), Steven Seagal (who was offered a part but turned it down due to a conflict with one of the producers) and Jean-Claude Van Damme (who rejected a part because he didn't think there was enough substance to the part. Come on Van Damme, give us a break!). Had they cast all those guys it really would have been an action lovers dream feast but there's always the sequels (which one is in development right now).<br/><br/>Stallone plays Barney Ross the leader of a team of mercenaries who are hired to perform the most deadly and dangerous military missions the Government and other agencies have to offer, due to the fact that they're deemed 'expendable'. Statham is Barney's best friend and knife throwing expert Lee Christmas, Li is the martial arts expert of the group Ying Yang, Couture is the team's demolition expert Toll Road, Crews is a long time long-barrel expert known as Hale Ceaser and Lundgren is the team's expert sniper Gunnar Jensen. As the movie opens the team is forced to cut Gunnar loose from the team due to his battle with drugs and 'inner demons', this comes back to haunt them later on. They're then offered a job in Vilena by a man they think is a CIA front-man named Mr. Church (Willis) after another team lead by an old rival partner of Barney's named Trench (Schwarzenegger) turns it down. The mission is to over throw a South American dictator (played by David Zayas) so Ross and Christmas travel to Vilena to scout out the area and meet their rebel contact (played by Giselle Itie) who they later learn is the daughter of the General dictator. They also learn that they're also up against a ruthless former CIA operative known as James Munroe (played by Eric Roberts) and his henchman (Austin) who are in league with the general. After narrowly escaping death the team decides to give up on the mission but Barney can't forget about the young rebel who stayed behind and after receiving some advice from his longtime friend Tool (Rourke) decides that the only way to save his soul is to save her. So the team decides to continue with the seemingly suicidal mission.<br/><br/>The film is almost wall to wall action with some of the bloodiest and most brutal violence ever depicted on screen and one of the highest body counts of any movie period. The story is of course routine and the characters underdeveloped but those things aren't necessary to a film like this. The sole purpose of a movie like this is to give the action genre fans exactly what they want to see, good old fashioned action. At this it definitely succeeds. It's obviously a nostalgic throwback to the action films of yesterday, although it still has the stylistic camera work and fast cuts action films are famous for today. <br/><br/>Stallone is a great movie star, one of the best, not a great actor, although a good one, but a great iconic movie star. He is a great writer and director as well and I think he could be the next Clint Eastwood; the action films he's directed show much more skill and talent than any of the action films Eastwood ever directed. Growing up I was a big Stallone fan, I was a bigger Schwarzenegger and Willis fan, but I also loved Stallone films. Now I've come to realize that he's a better actor and filmmaker than either of the other two. He tends to play the silent and awkward outcast underdog that always beats the odds and conquers his doubters by being the real deal true hero in the end. His films are much more inspirational and relate-able to dreamers everywhere. That's why he's a better movie star than all of the other action heroes. He's made some bad films but they've all been memorable. The rest of the cast are all good and great presences themselves, it's Stallone that really brings it all together and makes it work though. He is the world's top action star and this action extravaganza is one of the great ones.<br/><br/>Watch our review show, 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNa6Ky58lm8"

The main problem with this film is the action sequences if it's an action movie shouldn't you be able to see the action sequences. All of the fight scenes were so dark that it was hard to tell what was happening. There was no chemistry between the two best friends Stallone and Statham instead it seemed like they had just gotten together to make a movie and that't it. Of course Stallone wrote and directed the movie so there is tough guy dialogue through out. I think he is 60 years old now so by now he should have learned how to write decent dialogue. At least every character while in a fight scene puts up their dukes and tells their combatant ""Come on!"" That get's pretty boring after awhile. I also don't like celebrity cameos. Arnie and Bruce Willis really have no place in the movie. Their scene feels like something that was put in as an after thought. It was good to see Charisma Carpenter again since I was just thinking about her, but there isn't any time for women in this film. It's all about muscle bound macho guys.

I didn't expect a deep story with unforeseen plot twists and dialogs that really makes you think, with a film like this you want to see bigger than big explosions and blood, bullets and limbs flying all over the place. And that's what you certainly get with this one. But that doesn't mean all else can be totally neglected. I mean, my little brother who's 8 could have wrote this if he could write. The story is far from interesting, the characters are as shallow as shallow can be, the script together with the dialogs make eyebrows raise and elbows shrug and the acting overall is awful at times. Most of them still really try hard to get something out of their part, like Ludgren, but fail because of bad script writing, with on the other hand people who shouldn't have gotten so many lines in the first place, like Jet Li. And then there is Stallone himself, the one looking like Michael Jackson on steroids. The guy is such a character of himself now, it's ridicules. It even made me laugh on occasion. And in the end he is to blame for all this. No,this was not the movie i dreamt about when i was young, for most part that is. Schwarzenegger and Willis couldn't even give more than just cameos and Jean Claude van Damme wasn't even in it at all (which was his own fault) so in the end this was a big fail for me.

First of all, the script is pure crap. It's like they started shooting the movie with an uncompleted script. Or cut half of it randomly. Dialogues are totally pointless, boring and not funny at all. Character development is non-existent, it's hard to be sympathetic towards any of the characters. For example, i doubt anyone would notice, if Jet Li had been dropped out of the movie halfway through. I really didn't understand why he accepted the role anyway. Throughout the movie, he just shows up randomly, gets beaten and tries to be funny. That's it. Even the action sequences are far from impressive and badly directed, particularly the martial arts scenes. And last, but not least, acting is so poor that Sylvester Stallone looks like he's a parody of himself.<br/><br/>It's like Stallone summoned his friends and said, ""Hey, let's shoot some random sh*t and make some money"". I hope he works with a better screen writer next time. I give this movie 1 star, plus 2 for Jason Statham only."
"chucknorrisfacts","4","5","11","17 September 2010"," Crappy action movie
","Whenever a movie has to boast an ""all-star"" cast, it usually means it's trying to make up for a lame script with star power. Unfortunately, ""The Expendables"" is no exception to this rule.<br/><br/>At first glance, it seems to be a great idea to throw in as many stars as possible into one movie. That is, until you realize that the more characters a story has, the less time it has to develop all of them.<br/><br/>I realize this is an action movie but even action movies need to develop their characters. If we're to care about these characters at all, we need to know who they are and why we should root for them. That simply doesn't happen in this movie.<br/><br/>Let me take some time here to throw out my thoughts on each of the main actors in the movie and what I liked/disliked about them: <br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone: I consider myself to be a fan of Stallone's. I loved both""Rocky Balboa"" and ""Rambo"" and really thought he was going to pull off something cool with this movie, but he didn't. He seems kind of tired throughout the movie, at least in his performance but his action sequences come off well for the most part.<br/><br/>Jason Statham: I do not consider myself to be a fan of Statham's, although I will admit that in this movie, he stole the show. He and Stallone's characters were probably the most developed of all, but that's not saying much. His action sequences were pretty awesome.<br/><br/>Jet Li: He's poorly utilized in this movie and has a significantly smaller part than either Stallone or Statham and his lines are all pretty stupid. His action sequences were good, but there wasn't enough of them.<br/><br/>Eric Roberts: He was decent as the bad guy in the movie, I wanted to hit him, so I suppose that counts for something. I couldn't tell if Roberts was annoying or if that was the character he was trying to play. Either way, he's pretty grating to watch.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger: I put both of these guys together for no other reason than neither one of them is in the movie long enough to justify a separate paragraph for each. In the church scene, where Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger meet discuss the possibility of going on a mission (which becomes the main plot line of the story), both Stallone and Schwarzenegger seem to be out ""alpha'd"" by Willis. Although it was cool to see these guys share the screen together, the end result left something to be desired, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Although Randy Couture was far from a main character in the story, I feel he deserves a special mention for what is quite possibly the worst acting I've ever seen aside from Robert Pattinson. This guy needs to go back to fighting in a cage for his money. Wow! Horrible, horrible actor. <br/><br/>There were many attempts at humor in this movie that fell completely flat. I didn't laugh not once, nor did anyone else sitting in the movie theater. That's kind of unusual for an action movie these days not to feature any great one-liners. Action movies are known for their one-liners and yet this movie didn't produce not one of them.<br/><br/>The blood/gore effects were pretty cheesy and were obviously computer generated. It was distracting and really took away from the intensity of the action sequences. I guess nobody ever thought to use good ol' fashioned fake blood? It looks so much better on screen than the digitized crap they subjected us to here.<br/><br/>I don't really know what else to say about the movie other than to strongly urge anyone reading this who hasn't seen it already to avoid it at all costs. For the people that have seen it, tell your friends and family to save their money and go see something else."

","I get it I totally do . This was supposed to be a homage to all the 80s and 90s action films that made Stallone, Willis etc household names . Thing is it kind of failed to do that or well do anything really .<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.... Oh no the body count was there and the explosions were there and the stars were there and the guns were there and there were some very nice sequences ...thing is that is all you remember ( I can for example remember Terry Cruz's gun rather than his character ). There were also too many out of plot moments . Like the meeting with Arnie, Stallone and Willis - Planet Hollywood anyone ? One moment I thought was quite funny was where the bad guy went into a speech about not hurting women then handing her over to Steve Austin and given his legal issues and accusations that was a little in bad taste .<br/><br/>What is disappointing is all through the film there are parts you expect to develop into something don't . Charisma Carpenter appeared in two scenes as a disgruntled love interest for no reason . Dolph had an interesting character flaw in he was an addict but that story thread went no where ...and I know that 80s action flicks were not known for character development but they were not grotesque cardboard cut outs .<br/><br/>By the end of the film when Stallone is shot it is a meah moment because there had been no build up to that point and to be honest there was no peril threat or investment by the characters or the crew so the audience were feeling like they had been taken for a ride .<br/><br/>And I think this the worst part of the film and the aspect that separates it from the 80s action films and that is I cared about the heroes in those films . In this one I couldn't even name them ..."
"velniomerga","2","5","11","3 September 2010"," just.... sad
","Yes, my first thought was - this is Sex and the City for men. Yes, I am a woman. And - yes, I really enjoy a good action movie. Because I like tough guys. Tough guys with brain, that is. And sadly, this movie had non - tough guys with brain, that is.. Scenario - 0, action scenes - boring, close-up action scenes with Jason Statham - the only thing worth going through this agony. Yes, I understand, one should not expect elaborate dialogues and twisted story in an action flick - but still??? What makes a good movie? 1. A good story, 2. Nice special effects/action scenes. This movie had none, except for the few with Jason Statham, as mentioned above. I couldn't stop myself from comparing this nonsense to Bourne trilogy - one of the best action movies I've ever seen. That one had it all: good story as a framework, some really good action scenes and a HERO. Expendables? Hardly explainable scenario, 1 good action scene and a hero who is in mid-sixties, hardly capable of running and getting his ass kicked (and admitting it!!!).I winced when I saw Stallone running in one scene - I thought he would break his hip! And lousy dialogues.. Why couldn't they just let Mickey Rourke quietly make the tattoos and not babble on some pseudo-existential nonsense? Could've used the time for some good scenes. Really, really bad movie. And I only gave 2 because of Statham, otherwise it could've been 0."
"mihnea_kuaniCS","10","5","11","29 August 2010"," Well..some people just don't get it.
","Thing is, i've read a lot of the comments/reviews about this movie, and to say the least, i'm surprised. People are going on and on, ranting about how this movie should have been awesome, because of the cast, but it sucked because it didn't have a good enough story, etc, etc. What did you all expect? Stanley Kubrick or Alfred Hitchcock - type plots that challenge your brain and make you feel smart after/for watching the movie? A bit ironic to say so, but grow up folks. This movie did not set out to blow everybody's mind through interesting character development or such things. It just put together all our favorite action-movie stars, or most of them at least, and showed us that they can all kick some bad-guy arse in the same flick. Sure it isn't all that complicated, rather simple actually, but that IS the whole point. Personally i think that people have the tendency to bash this title simply because they can't let aside their self-absorption and enjoy this hour and a half long ACTION movie, or have we all forgotten what that means?<br/><br/>What's happened to the world, have we all become so smart and knowledge-thirsty that we can't be pleased with old-school beat-em-ups anymore? And really good ones to add to that. That's just ignorant.<br/><br/>So yeah, this movie set out to be awesome, and it did exactly that."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","5","11","17 August 2010"," I got the testosterone, but where are the steroids?
","If you're like me when you saw this film, I'm pretty sure you're a huge action movie fan as well. You name it, I love it: Face/Off, Die Hard, Rocky, Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour, First Blood, Terminator and my all time favorite Commando. The 80's action films to me are just beyond awesome, as stupid, cliché and ridicules as they are, they are so much fun. I cannot describe the fantastic time I have when watching a film like Commando. The weird thing is about a year ago I was telling my boyfriend that there hasn't been a real great action movie since Face/Off or Con Air. Most are going for the realism, there's no more cheesy one-liners, no cliché British villains, no insane crazy explosions where the hero of our story walks away unscathed. I had this sad face when saying that because I don't think we could ever have that again. But then I saw that The Expendables was in the works and I went insane calling my friends and telling them how I couldn't wait to see this movie. Stallone, Schwartenegger and Willis are back, it's like your favorite rock group from the 80's come back for the biggest concert and the final farewell.<br/><br/>A group of elite mercenaries, the Expendables: Barney Ross, former SAS soldier Lee Christmas, martial artist Yin Yang, sniper Gunnar Jensen , weapons specialist Hale Ceasar and demolitions expert Toll Road. Yang and Jensen have a brief fight, only for Ross to intervene. In the aftermath, Ross reluctantly releases Jensen from the Expendables due to psychological problems. Ross then goes to a church, where he and his rival, Trench meet ""Mr. Church"", who offers them a mission in Vilena, to overthrow a brutal dictator, General Garza. Busy with other things, Trench gives the contract to Ross. Ross and Lee Christmas do initial reconnaissance after meeting with their contact, Sandra, only for the mission to go awry. Sandra is revealed to be Garza's daughter. Ross then decides to abort, and causes casualties among the army as they escape, but feels guilt for leaving Sandra behind. The Expendables then infiltrate Garza's compound, with Ross bent on rescuing Sandra, while Christmas, Yang, Ceasar, and Road plant explosive charges throughout the site and prepare for battle.<br/><br/>Sadly, this film was a disappointment. Not to say that it was bad or anything, but it didn't have that ""wow"" factor that we wanted. This film has a pre-curse, most action movie fans knew what they wanted and had this movie already played out in their heads. I have to admit that maybe my expectations were too high, because I just felt sad after seeing it. Let's start with the villain, they didn't seem too threatening. First off they seemed to be more angry with each other than with our hero's, so ironically the hero's should just step aside and just let the villains beat up each other. Secondly, they were scary on some level, but I didn't feel that hatred for them like I did for the villains in Rambo that makes you want their blood to be splattered across the screen. Also Dolph Lundgren would have been a better villain as he's a more dimensional character that was a perfect opportunity for a traitor. I was so hoping for when Sylvester shot him two inches above the heart and Dolph asks him if he's going to die, Sylvester says ""If you die, you die"", wouldn't that have been the most perfect ironic line in the world? That would have made the film so much more awesome.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Willis and Schwartzenegger are in it for barely 2 minutes, which was really depressing. I was telling my friend that what would have been great is to see these guys together in the final battle. Because the film also stars the upcoming great action stars, it would have been like them passing the torch. The film is also badly edited, I don't think Stallone is meant as an action director. The shots are too close up and gets you too confused to see who's fighting who. Jet Li who is an incredible martial artist is toned down too much. The whole motivation for Stallone to come back to the violence is for a girl who he doesn't even have a cliché kiss with! If this film had different stars in it, I think The Expendables would have been a terrific film, but because Stallone was saying that this was an ""homage"" to the 80's action films, this was a huge disappointment. I was so excited and just let down. The film had so much more potential, guess I'll have to wait for the 5th farewell concert for these guys. Because the sequel better be like that Itchy and Scratchy episode from The Simpsons where they were pointing guns at each other and they kept getting bigger and bigger, I want that with these guys. I want them to fly past the moon screaming all their famous one liners including Samuel L. Jackson screaming ""That's what I'm talking about Motha-$#@$@$a!"". Now that is an action film that will blow all the others out of the water.<br/><br/>6/10"
"grantss","2","2","3","7 November 2015"," Watching this, you can feel your IQ reducing...
","Very lame. I guess the story behind the movie goes something like this: Sylvester Stallone decides to make a movie with old buddies, most of whom are, like him, has-beens who never could act anyway (see Dolph Lundgren, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Eric Roberts, Jet Li), though some (Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis) are pretty good. Decides to throw in some fresh, well-known faces (Jason Statham, David Zayas of Dexter fame) and sports stars (Randy Couture, Steve Austin) to bring in the kids. Having locked in the cast, discovers there is no budget left for a decent writer or director, so decides to do those himself.<br/><br/>Thus was born The Expendables - no plot, no direction, but every face a star and heaps of crap gets blown up in bright colours and with a loud bang.<br/><br/>Avoid, unless you want to be able to pinpoint the moment your IQ reduced."
"Bruce722","9","2","3","24 February 2015"," Very action-packed and entertaining
","The Expendables is very action-packed and entertaining. There were some obvious flaws like a lack of substantial character development and a not-so-original plot. However, this movie did have some of the most realistic and intense hand-to-hand fight sequences I've ever seen and who doesn't like big guns and bigger explosions. The fact that they were able to take so many great action heroes and put them all in the same movie without much sacrifice was amazing. Also, I felt that Mickey Rourke's character was so crucial in added depth and layers to what would otherwise have been a fairly shallow film. The self-absorbed movie critics will hate on this movie because ""it lacked unique cinematic effects"" or whatever clichéd criticism they normally say, but if you want to see an action-packed movie with a full cast of action heroes, you won't regret watching this movie. After all, the whole point of cinema is to entertain isn't it?"
"Gilliam123","7","2","3","31 December 2011"," The Expendables review
","If your looking for any type of intelligence, do not watch this film, because it will just annoy you. The film's aim is to essentially pit every action star since the 80s against each other, with cast including Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Steve Austin, Randy Couture, Terry Crews and Mickey Rourke. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger make very unhidden cameos, and are uncredited. Like Rambo 4, it is directed and co-written by Stallone. The story follows a bunch of super-tough mercenaries (Led by Stallone)who are hired by a powerful incorporator (Willis) to recapture an island from a military dictator (David Zayas). But Zayas has his own personal army, and is being supported by Ex-CIA Agentd (Roberts and Austin). I felt that the pace dragged in the middle, between the two major trips to the island. I also felt that the characters of the Expendables were either too prominent, e.g. Statham and Lundgren, or not prominent enough, e.g. Crews and Couture. While Stallone's directing isn't of the brilliance that some actor-directors are, he does know how to handle the pace and excitement of every action scene. Every actor does what they do best - very little talk, lots of punch, but for me the actor who stood out among the ensemble was Mickey Rourke, who takes a small supporting role as Tool, a character who simply hangs out with The other Expendables, and gives them tattoos and gives them the lowdown on missions."

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","1","1","31 October 2019"," Bad-ass old school action one of the best action movies my favorite Stallone flick
","The best Stallone action film old school action rated - R bloody with explosions, great soundtracks and old school action heroes. Sylvester Stallone brings old school action heroes together: Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Steve Austin, Charisma Carpenter, Gary Daniels, Randy Couture, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The first in The Expendables trilogy is the best one and it is my favorite action old school flick of old action heroes. I love this film to death, one of the best Stallone action flicks out there. Sly directed and wrote a script for the movie and it is original, it succeeded in many levels of action/ stunts, models puppetry, lots of automatic and explosive weapons they are used well.<br/><br/>The Expendables is a hard hitting action/thriller about a group of mercenaries hierd to inflitrate a South American country and overthrow ruthles dictator. Once the mission begins, the men realize things aren't quite as they appear, finding them selfs caught in a dangerous web if decet and betreyal. With their mission threated and an innocent life in danger the men struggle with an even tougher challenge one that treatens to destroy this band of brothers.<br/><br/>The action scenes are well done, it has tones of action practical effects. I don't agree the action scenes are digitaly filmed I do not see that way, they are great. Stallone did all his stunts by him self. The fight between Stallone and Steve Austin were practical done. They fight was for real and Stallone really hurt him self. This movie is old school action Sly isn't Rocky and Rambo two characters in one, it is different approach for Sly. Stallone's character wears the seme hat that he did in Demolition Man my personal favorite action film Stallone ever did. I am huge Rocky and Rambo fan, The expendables is a damn good action movie.<br/><br/>This is the second colloboration between Stallone, Eric Roberts and Dolph Lundgren all three men worked together on movies in the 80's and 90's. Eric Roberts did worked with Stallone on The Specialist (1994) before and Dolph Lundgren worked with Stallone on Rocky IV and last year on Creed II (2018). Jason Statham and Jet Li are bad-asses in this movie they fight with Steve Austin. Jet Li fights with Dolph Lundgren. Great martial arts performed great acting, great choreographed. This is my action movie those are my action movies from the 80's and 90's I love. This movie isn't 80's or 90's is 2010 but for that year it is a straight-foward action movie with reasonable run time that sustains itself and never has a chance to feel dull.<br/><br/>The camera, the photography and choreography is still colerful creative enough and do the work right. Music score is from Brian Tyler he previously worked on Rambo (2008) and now Rambo: Last Blood (2019) music score. Mickey Rourke is in this movie too, but his character has nothing much to do, except been a mentor and teacher to Stallone's character Barney Ross. I love the soundtrack The Boys Are Back in Town by Thin Lizzy. I am still waiting for the fourth The Expendables movie.<br/><br/>I don't know what else can I say that I already said: the mercenaries lead by Barney Ross they go on this mission in South American country in Vilena island. The group find out that the island is lead by the dictator General Garza (David Zayas) and James Munroe (Eric Roberts) an ex CIA agent now a drug dealer. He makes profits in this island and uses General Garza for his own profits. Sandra (Giselle Itié) is actually General's daughter and she is Ross contact. The reason why the group is called The Expendables is because CIA played by Bruce Willis as Mr. Church hires them to kill General Garza but their target is Munroe, because CIA can't kill one of them. So they sent these guys to do their dirty work that is why they are called The Expendables. This group are strand in this island and they decide to finish their job. Gunner Jensen played by Dolph Lundgren goes rouge and he goes after Ross and Yang played by Jet Li. It has great car chase. Li pulls out a Machine Pistol MP-9 and fiers at the pursuers like Stallone did in Cobra (1986) one of my favorite action films of all time. Stallone and Li worked well together, but the chemistry between Statham and Stallone really worked well. I thought they worked well together.<br/><br/>Steve Austin is great as one of the bad guys, he is excellent he is one of my favorite wretlers of all time. Gary Daniels is in this movie as Austin second henchman he is a bad-ass. Great fight with Jet Li, with Statham against Gary Daniels. Excellent fight with Steve Austin and Randy Couture excellent choreographed. I heard that Randy Couture was in army and he is an ex UFC fighter so that is coold to see him in these kinda movies. Jet Li as Yin Yang is awesome, he is a bad-ass I am a huge fan of him. Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen is a bad-ass he is great, goes rouge but he still survives in this movie. The opening scene you have a rescue mission the mercenaries saves those hostages on a ship so that's cool.<br/><br/>The ending has bad-ass kick-ass action, it is fast paced entertaing movie only for action fans. Their was this 90's action movie The Bad Pack (1997) about mercenaries but I did not care about the flick. The expendables is much better action movie. I love this film to death, it is definitely in my top 10 favorite Stallone movies."

They really need to expand on the characters. Jet li was a great action star and they just made him look like a bitch in this movie. I remember when Steve Austin was great in Predator in this movie he couldn't have been more generic. And the action ...geeez I literally fast forwarded the last sequence because it was so boring.

","I was super hyped when this film came out years ago. It had every action star imaginable all together fighting crime and kicking ass.

The directing is really annoying and suffers from BS quick-cut editing where you cant see a single thing that's going on. We know people like Statham, Stallone, Lundgren, and Stone Cold Steve Austin can fight, so why can't we see it? The plot is really boring and you wish that maybe they would've done something a lot more interesting than a generic plot ripped from Commando or Rambo. When I first saw the film in theaters, I actually really liked the plot because it was an exact homage to 80's action film plots, but after rewatching it, I definitely think something different should've been done here. I meant the film is not bad, but it is not great anymore. If there is one thing the film excels on, it's the gore. The gore in this film is so over-the-top that it's amazing...that is, when it isn't CGI. The only thing truly worth noting is the actors. It is AWESOME to see them interacting together on screen like they do in this film. Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Schwarzenneger, Willis, Li, Austin, and Crews are all incredible with their witty dialog and exchanges, and even cooler with their big guns and fight scenes.

","In 2010, Sylvester Stallone has the idea to take every current and former action star, and put them into a series of movies. The goal was to create the biggest, wildest, most expensive action movies ever made, and have them feature every big name action star from the past 30 years. The studio was so much behind the idea, that not only did they give Stallone a huge budget, but they also approved a sequel, before the first film was even in theaters. It took me 5 years to watch this movie, because I honestly didn't think it was going to work. There is an old saying about having too many cooks in the kitchen, and while trying to include everyone was admirable, I couldn't imagine it working, I was wrong. Stallone leads a freelance para-military organization known as the expendables. These guys work for the highest bidder and do things the government can't. In the first installment of the now billion dollar franchise, the expendables are tasked with stopping a coup on a Caribbean island. If the rival organization takes control, the island would be the largest manufacture of illegal narcotics in the world, and would be impossible to stop, enter the expendables. Sylvester Stallone may be a senior citizen now and still somewhat hard to understand, but when it comes to action movies, you'd be hard pressed to find a better leader. His second in command is currently the largest action star in the world, Jason Statham. Even after seeing hundreds of action movies, including most of Statham's, the guy continues to impress me at every turn. All the strange accents make for an interesting mix of dialogue, but that aside, the story is good, the fight scenes are better, and the special effects are amazing. The Expendables was billed as THE action film to see and it does not disappoint."

","The Expendable is an ensemble action film that stars Sylvester Stallone together with Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Steve Austin,Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. The movie is about a group of elite mercenaries that are on a mission to overthrow a Latin American dictator that they later discover to be a mere puppet of an ex-CIA officer.Stallone co-wrote and directed it.<br/><br/>The Expendables is a group of elite mercenaries from New Orleans.The team consists of its leader Barney Ross together with blades specialist Lee Christmas, martial artist Yin Yang, Gunner Jensen, weapons specialist Hale Caesar, and demolitions expert Toll Road. A shadowy ""Mr Church"" approach them to overthrow the tyrannical South American dictator General Gaza and restore order to the troubled island country of Vilena.It isn't long before it was known the real target happens to be a former CIA officer,James Monroe.This makes the mission substantially more difficult than expected.<br/><br/>The film was advertised as a throwback to action movies of the 80's and 90's.The actions scenes were definitely huge and excessively violent.No question that action film lovers will definitely enjoy and will be enormously entertained watching this movie.Too bad that despite the talent involved,the film came out to be just ordinary for there is nothing really new or groundbreaking.Besides,the only achievement it managed to get is to have great action stars get assembled in one big film."

","The Expendables is one of the movies Sylvester Stallone has been making since the 1980's. In this sense, The Expendables could be classified as ""what you see is what you get"". There are endless amounts of testosterone, shooting, explosions and other action sequences.<br/><br/>And after all has quieted down, Sylvester Stallone would sit in the cockpit of his airplane and sip on a beer while flying his team to a safe haven. There are also some jokes along the way, as a regular staple in such movies.<br/><br/>Otherwise there is not much to be said or remembered about The Expendables."
"rcolgan","5","1","1","13 July 2014"," A great premise but in need of better execution
","My expectations for the Expendables were extremely high with the potential for some of the best on screen fights. I was expecting something equal to the Bruce Lee v Chuck Norris fight in the Way of the Dragon. But unfortunately what could have been one of the greatest action movies of all time ended up being nothing more than a generic action with little memorability other than its cast. <br/><br/>Ultimately the film is centred around one gimmick. Get the biggest action stars and put them together on screen. At first the premise sounds like a good one, but the problem is that its a tough idea to get right. With so many people in one film it becomes difficult to let any of them shine as they would on a lone outing since they get quite little screen time. What would usually seem cool like machine gunning a room full of bad guys feels mundane when everyone else in the film is doing it too. Also many of the names don't get much more than a cameo with both Willis and Schwarzenegger getting less than 5 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>Possibly you could make the premise work with a really good script that can juggle all the characters as films like Ocean 11 had done before it. But unfortunately Stallone was not up to the job. Unlike the action movies that made us love these stars, it has no memorable moments. He seemed more relied on the cast to make the film work than using the script to make the actors more effective. The actors do their best to bring some charm to the film and at times it can lead to some cool moments but not often.<br/><br/>The fights seem to blend together since nothing seems to happen other than a lot of explosions and endless numbers of faceless bad guys dying. Watching these fights actually bugged me to see how the actions have changed since those iconic ones of the 70's and 80's. Instead of the realistic blood pouches they used to use, we now only see extremely fake VFX blood splatter. This mixed with the fake gunfire draws little interest in to any of the action scenes and makes it far weaker than those classic actions that it's trying to duplicate. <br/><br/>Plus all of the dialogue is so dull and adds little personality to these heroes. There's no ""I am the law"" or ""I'll be back"" lines that will have us quoting these films for years. The best the film will give is a wink to the audience by referencing these lines instead of making its own memorable lines. The script tries to capitalise on out love of great actions instead of making one itself.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of any of the stars it may be worth watching as it's still an OK action. But the only way to get the best of any of these actors is watching them on their own."

","Sylvester Stallone may be laughed at for trying to resurrect his film career after vanishing into oblivion (sort of) like many of his co-stars in the film, but I've got to give it to the guy for taking the risk. 'The Expendables' by no means is a great film. It's closer to the opposite and considering that it had so many action heroes (who were once popular), I expected some awesome fight sequences. However, the fight scenes were pretty ordinary, nothing memorable. The writing itself is quite poor. The script is full of holes and dialogue is unengaging and sometimes unintentionally funny (mostly because of the way they are delivered by the actors). With the exception of Roarke's Tool and Statham's Lee, the characters lack dimension. Anyway, one doesn't expect fine writing from such movies.<br/><br/>The positives are that it was nice to see so many actors, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Eric Roberts, Mickey Roarke, Dolph Lundgren etc who were once famous for their action films (even rivals), share screen space with actors like Jet Li and Jason Statham (both of whom rule the action films of the 2000s) and there seems to be a camaraderie and an amicable chemistry. Of the performances, Mickey Roarke stands out while the rest are passable at best (then again this kind of movie doesn't require fine acting) and otherwise horrendous. Moreover, in spite of the flaws, the film has plenty of energy to not bore you to sleep."

The martial arts scenes were intense, and actually very realistic. You could see pieces of wrestling and Jiujitsu injected into the choreography, and it looked very clean.<br/><br/>The story was fairly simple, but I wasn't looking for much, just enough to tie in all the action stars with their battle scenes, and it did just that.<br/><br/>They're a mercenary team hired to take out a corrupt dictator and the high dollared drug lords he's working with.

","All the great action sequences in the world cannot save a movie that has no character. With all the veteran talent coming together I expected a lot more character, humour, and perhaps a bit of a developed story. I didn't get a lot of this. Instead I got the feel that a lot of the dialogue was improvised - which is the difference between stand-up comedy and comedy improv. I got the feeling that there was not a whole lot of chemistry amongst these guys that we are supposed to be cheering for. The great Bruce Willis was given a role that was so far beneath his abilities and talent that it left me feeling a bit confused as to how this script was written. They try for a little mock sentimentality in the character portrayed by Mickey Rourke but this doesn't really fly either within the 1-dimensional action storyline. The irony is that it is usually in the nature of these movies that anyone speaking English with an accent is a bad guy; well the worst butchering of the English language in this movie comes from the mumbling protagonists."

The scenes that rely on a band of brother camaraderie feel fake and lifeless with no foundation whatsoever, when the main character looks lovingly at the damsel in distress there is absolutely no believability and would be funny in a cult classic kind of way if there wasn't so much excessive violence moments before. There is nothing about this film that suggests cult classic. I have noticed over time some films that were originally criticized harshly and given one or two stars start creeping up the respect ladder to a three or four star status as the creative genius is acknowledged, this films rating should begin to drop as a result of its mediocrity, and lack of any creativity.<br/><br/>Disappointment is the bottom line."

The acting was sub par (except for Mickey Rourke), the dialog was terrible (Shut up insect!), and the story left a lot to be desired. <br/><br/>The funny thing is, this film should have worked. He had a great concept (getting all the great action heroes and putting them in one film), cool bad guys (Eric Roberts, and Steve Austin), beautiful women (Charisma Carpenter, and the other Latino chick who I can't remember the name of), and a heck of a lot of explosions, and fighting.<br/><br/>So what didn't work? I mean, why did this impossible concept fail?<br/><br/>You wanna know why?<br/><br/>Because he didn't utilize the great talents of the men he hired.<br/><br/>Jet Li- Horribly underused. Barely does any of the moves he's known for. And just becomes a token Asian guy, who's the butt of jokes. I mean I can't remember how many times they made fun of how small he was. He was the true gem of this film who needed to shine for who he was. But this film never gave him a chance.<br/><br/>Terry Crews- A big man, who is remarkably funny, but they dummied him down. Tried to keep him serious. He would have been great comic relief, but was instead cast as a serious soldier, with just isn't his style (White Chicks, Benchwarmers, and Everybody Hates Chris attests to how funny he is), while still being a little tough, and funny.<br/><br/>Charisma Carpenter- Beautiful woman, but was mainly posted there for her great beauty, then for her ability to act. Sly's a good director. He should have pulled it out of her.<br/><br/>Dolph Lundgren- He's a brilliant man in real life. Just watch him in interviews. He went to MIT for gosh sakes! His character should have been closer to who he is in real life (brilliant, with a scientific mind, but as tough as hell). The tough as Hell part they got right, but having him cast as a dumb brute just didn't work. <br/><br/>Randy Courture- I couldn't even figure out the kind of character he was. Other then a good fight scene with Austin, and an explanation of what the cauliflower ear was, which were good and funny, but other than that, there really wasn't much development about who this character was, or enough scenes to learn about his personality.<br/><br/>The fighting was too quick, and had too many fast cuts. I couldn't even catch what was going on, and the plot was too simple, too Hollywood to really be anything special.<br/><br/>And the explosions just became monotonous, and full of useless boring noise.<br/><br/>I mean there were a few good scenes (like the one with Mickey Rourke, and Sly), and a few great action sequences, along with good support from Statham, and a worthy buddy to Sly, but overall, it just wasn't a good film.<br/><br/>So in the end I spent a total of $19.50 for myself, and my friend. $9.75 each.<br/><br/>That's a lot of money, and it felt like I got robbed.<br/><br/>I mean, it's Sly's a great chef, who made his food, with all the correct ingredients, but put in too much of this, and too little of that, and slopped it together really quickly, without cooking it all the way through.<br/><br/>Sorry, but I don't think I'll be staying for dessert."

","Inside this large aging slick celebrity beats the heart of a 12 year-old wrestling fan, and it's let out to play when he directs a movie. In a Hollywood overrun with action directors seeking to one-up each other in realism, here's a guy who you can see is still very much in touch with his childhood action imagination.<br/><br/>As you watch this movie (along with the latest Rambo, another action throwback that he also directed), you can almost hear his directives: <br/><br/>""Hey, in this scene, wouldn't it be awesome if this guy got torn in half? Actually, let's have him get punched in the balls first though."" <br/><br/>""I want the good guy to upper-cut the bad guy so hard that he flies up in the air, and then he'll throw him back down to the ground with the same hand! Can we do that? Let's do that. It'll be so cool."" <br/><br/>""I've got this great idea, one of our good guys will have his own special gun, and it'll be like this super gun that only he has, it'll be really powerful and stuff, you know? And he only takes it out when things get really bad so he winds up saving the day, right? Let's do that."" <br/><br/>The problem for me is that these ""qualities"" extend to Stallone's story writing, too -- this innocent little boy has no qualms about repeating overused clichés and melodrama, and god bless him for being that innocent; but those are unfortunately my biggest downers when it comes to movies. <br/><br/>Now, I realize this particular movie is billed as an intentional throwback of sorts, but having seen it, to chalk it up to simply being ""old-school"" would be giving it too much credit. This movie is frankly bad, even for an '80s cliché. Stallone might defend it by implying that he could make a good modern movie and simply chooses not to, and we all might go along with that explanation because we love the guy so much; I'm just not sure how truly accurate it is. <br/><br/>Stallone's creative tendencies wouldn't be so much of a problem, except for the fact that he insists on taking such an active role in writing the scripts he directs.

","Some movies lend themselves to a review, others don't. The Expendables falls into the latter category, even though I'm going ahead with one anyway. This isn't because it's a bad film, but rather because it's the epitome, the essential oil, the distilled essence (to pooch a host of hoary adjectives) of the action genre, and in that sense, it's a home-run.<br/><br/>It's akin to the 1948 classic Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, where the bumbling duo are pitted against the biggest bad-asses of the Universal monster stable, such as Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the Wolfman, and the Invisible Man.<br/><br/>Don't let the marquee movie posters deceive, sure The Expendables delivers ""almost"" every name from the 80's action ""classics"", but some – specifically Willis and Schwarzenegger – both appear in a single scene, and together at that, with Stallone, of course, who is everywhere. It's clearly little more than a wink toward the 80s icons, as well as the trio that founded the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain.<br/><br/>Insofar as popcorn munchers go, like the action vein it mines, The Expendables is pure eye candy. The movie is tailor-made for the big bucket-o'-popcorn and large drink, leaning back and enjoying the mayhem. Plus the movie features Eric Roberts, who saw fit to also star in SyFy's soon-to–be-seen Sharktopus (hey, there's been stranger career moves).<br/><br/>Yes there are passages where the dialogue appears to have been written by someone (Stallone?) on the crapper trying to pinch a big one, but that's typical of the 80s action flick. Plus the movie manages to make Statham stand out from the crowd as the closest thing to a thespian – and I like Statham so all's good there.<br/><br/>All this aside, there's copious amounts of martial arts Kung-Fu, mixed WWE-style wrestling, MMA beat downs and just plain punch-outs, knife fights, major league shoot outs (the carnage that Terry Crews' warhead gun inflicts has to be seen to be believed), and things being blown up on a truly epic scale.<br/><br/>Honestly? The best, most accurate and true to the genre way to review this film is not to write paragraphs about it, but recline in front of a video camera, decked out in overalls and a trucker cap, chewing on a chaw of tobacco, and spitting into a bucket while saying ""things blowed up real good"".<br/><br/>Yes, my friends, it's that much fun."

The modern action film insistence on intercutting multiple ultra short shots rather than allowing the viewer to have a clear view of events simply added to the irritation quotient.

Otherwise, there's no way someone who looks as good as Jason Statham (who disappointingly doesn't get to do any of the nifty stunt work he's known for) would be let within 100 feet of Sly and his seen-better-days pals. Though I did notice that Statham was not once allowed to appear without his shirt on....<br/><br/>Grade: C"

","Let The Expendables be a lesson to all moviegoers, if the previews for the movie mention that it has a ton of action stars and shows nothing else, it's because the movie has a lot of action stars in it, and nothing else. I could bore you with the details of the plot (there was one in there somewhere) but really, what's the point? So instead I will give you the reader's digest version. There are bad guys running some banana republic and Stallone and his crew go shoot/stab/explode them all. There you go. That's it, the whole movie. I hope it was good for you because I wasted an hour and a half to bring you that sentence.<br/><br/>While it might be OK for an action film to be very light on plot, it isn't OK for it to be light on action that makes any form of sense. I'm not talking about unrealistic action heroics, I'm fine with that. I'm talking about not having any idea whatsoever as to who is where and doing what to whom at any point in the film. The camera-work/story boarding/choreography was terrible, I never had any Idea what in the world was going on or why. It was so bad I can' t even give you a cohesive example of a bad scene because they all ran together in one mega action sequence that resulted in more fires than the Lakers winning the NBA championship. Who knew everything in the Caribbean was so explosive and flammable? No plot, no characterization to speak of, poor camera-work, confusing action sequences, and a boatload of meat heads makes for an expendable movie. Don't see it, it sucks."
"heihachimishima","3","4","9","2 November 2010"," The plot is Expendable
","There are a few moments during its running time where ""The Expendables"" manages to become the movie it should be, where it feels effortlessly bloodthirsty and appropriately over-the-top. There are moments of real red-meat action-movie glory, with bodies blown in half and entire buildings vanishing in white-hot explosions and one-liners that actually land a punch.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed this late-career resurgence by Sylvester Stallone. Both ""Rocky Balboa"" and ""Rambo"" demonstrated a real understanding of his own iconography, and walking into ""The Expendables,"" I hoped he was going to do the same for his whole cast, and that this would be a knowing celebration of the macho ensemble movie, a great big men-on-a-mission flick with a fat bag of mayhem to unleash on audiences conditioned by modern action films to expect special effects and shaky cams.<br/><br/>And, like I said, there are moments where the film almost pulls it off, but not enough of those moments, and they are unfortunately wrapped in a big limp noodle of a movie, a largely impotent mess that wastes its cast to no memorable effect. Taken as a whole, ""The Expendables"" is a disappointment, and a frustrating one at that.<br/><br/>Stallone plays Barney Ross, the leader of this group of mercenaries, and the film is, at heart, a buddy movie between him and Lee Christmas, played by Jason Statham. They're the real core of the movie. As much as the marketing for the film leans on the idea of the massive ensemble, there aren't many sequences where everyone appears on screen. The film opens, as so many action films do, at the tail end of a job. The Expendables have been engaged to free some hostages from some high-seas pirates, and they roll in as a group to do that in spectacular, bloody fashion. It's a strong sequence, and it sets up the dynamics of the group pretty well. During the tail end of the raid on the ship, Gunner (Dolph Lundgren) has a meltdown and threatens to hang one of the pirates for fun. When Ying Yang (Jet Li, and yes, I swear to god that's his character's name) stops Gunner, the big guy almost beats him to death. Barney steps in to stop the fight, and he throws Gunner off the team until he can get his drug habit under control.<br/><br/>The film downshifts a bit to show the guys during their off-hours, and here's where the problems start. Stallone and his co-writer Dave Callaham (""Doom,"" ""Tell-Tale"") want to make you care about these guys and their lives away from the battlefield, but they fail completely. Jason Statham's got a weak subplot about his maybe-girlfriend played by Charisma Carpenter that goes nowhere and that wastes her presence as a performer completely. Jet Li complains a few times about needing money for his family, but it never pays off in any way. Mickey Rourke shows up as a former mercenary-turned-tattoo-artist who is meant to spark some sort of crisis of conscience in Stallone's character, and he's got a monologue that is obviously supposed to be the soul of the film. But it's all so drenched in cliché, so painfully familiar, that it just doesn't connect. Rourke is a fascinating on screen figure these days, all ruined beauty and scar tissue, and he is good in his big moment... it's just that it doesn't feel connected to the movie around it, and the writing is so pedestrian that the performance works in spite of what is on the page, not because of it.<br/><br/>The ""big moment"" in the movie, ruined months ago by the trailers, involves Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, and it's honestly a non-starter. I guess if it's enough for you as an audience member to see the corporate partners behind Planet Hollywood on screen together, then you'll be happy. But aside from a bizarre non-sequitur about Arnold wanting to be President, there's nothing memorable or interesting about the scene. It's just three big-name actors standing around for a few minutes, and then it's over. If they had made a film with the three of them starring together, that would be something, but this is half-assed, and it pretty much sums up the movie. I get the intent, but the execution is lacking.<br/><br/>Willis hires Stallone and his team to head into a fictional banana republic and take the country back from the corrupt General Garza (David Zayas) and the rogue CIA agent James Muroe (Eric Roberts) that are bleeding it dry. Stallone and Statham venture down for a first look around, and they meet the general's daughter, Sandra (Giselle Itie), who is a freedom-fighter determined to topple her father's regime. She helps them to scout out the job... or at least that's what they're supposed to be doing... but again, the film sets up the most basic ideas for scenes or set pieces and then fumbles them, time and time again. All the first trip really does is give Stallone an excuse to go back and make it ""personal,"" because evidently his five minutes with a surly Latina are enough to suddenly awaken a sense of duty and love in him. It's one of those attractions of convenience, where Stallone becomes fixated on her because that's the only way they could motivate the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>It is worth stating again that a great action movie needs to have a bad guy (or bad guys) who are every bit as interesting as the heroes, and ""The Expendables"" fails that test outright."

","ex·pend·a·ble/ikˈspendabel/Adjective 1. (of an object) Designed to be used only once and then abandoned or destroyed. 2. Of little significance when compared to an overall purpose, and therefore able to be abandoned.<br/><br/>Remember the '80s? Those glory days where masculinity was epitomized (at least in the eyes of Hollywood) by men so enormous and muscular that even their eyes seem to flex, mowing through hordes of enemies using weapons larger than themselves with reckless abandon? Well Sylvester Stallone certainly doesn't have enough faith that you do, attempting to epitomize all the flagrant excesses of a decade in action films into a single bombastic one. So promised the movie's pre-release press at any rate. What such press failed to report was the crushing reality that Stallone may not understand the genre in which he himself proved such a pivotal figure very much at all. Or that his ""opus"", The Expendables, proves just as bloated, flimsy, drab and soulless a gratuitous action film as any that have crossed multiplexes in many a year. <br/><br/>Granted, any seeking out a film with such a bevy of behemoth-bicep performers for acting, story or emotional resonance would be laughably misguided in the first place. However, the particular joy of the '80s romps Stallone is attempting to steal from is a certain degree of self-effacing acknowledgement of their own ridiculous excesses, whereas The Expendables is played largely straight faced, as if fully buying into its own ludicrous 'epic mythology', despite being founded entirely on a plot so outrageously useless (some mumbled mercenary mission turned 'the woman I just met is cute so I will risk all of our lives to rescue her' escapade) it seems Stallone hacked out his portion of the script after one too many combat rehearsals. Furthermore, the film's pathetic attempts at surgically grafting humour or romance into the hackneyed mess only deepens the grave – hearing Statham and Stallone mope about their respective lady troubles in a helicopter marks one of the lowest points of Hollywood storytelling in ages. While there exist rare smudges of interesting musings on the rather obvious concern of ""being too old for this sh*t"", largely products of a bygone era (naturally no thought is devoted to the seeming necessity of padding the cast with more recent hard hitters such as Statham or Li), Stallone's film appears to have devoted more time ticking off boxes of ""what other action badasses can we cast and subsequently not utilize?"" than devoting any real thought to the film beyond the realm of concept. <br/><br/>But surely the action more than compensates for a script that is atrocious even by genre standards? Sadly no. It For a film filled with such an array of explosions, clouds of bullets and flying knives, The Expendables comes across as shockingly boring, with fights largely wrecked by atrocious visual effects (almost every character running or jumping during combat moves excessively quickly and jerkily as if replicated by cheap CGI, and Stallone's film seems sure to take the prize for 'least convincing explosions since the 1980s') too distracting to raucously enjoy. Whenever a fight sequence becomes the least bit engaging, threatening to impress with gruesome, bone crunching gleeful gratuity, it is punctually ruined by some heinous creative misfire (ie: Steve Austin attempting to deliver dialogue), which promptly derails the excitement and brings the audience back to thinking of more synonyms for 'terrible'. <br/><br/>Of course the acting is predictably execrable, with Stallone's decision to largely focus on his own hard-bitten hero as the lead being one of his most woeful creative decisions, harnessing one of his most pathetically nonexistent performances in a career chock full of them, seemingly nearly unable to move his body or face into more than a sour grimace. Sympathizing with such a granite lump of a protagonist proves nigh impossible let alone desirable. Jason Statham is more enjoyable, injecting some cheeky charisma and dazzlingly fluid fighting movements into a film desperate for any high points. However, Jet Li , Randy Couture and Terry Crews feel utterly unnecessary inclusions, their characters reduced to disastrous one note jokes, and Dolph Lundgren is a particularly embarrassing grunting mess as a junkie merc losing his edge. Eric Roberts does his best to make his paper-thin antagonist somewhat entertaining, but Steve Austin proves more hilarious than intimidating as a gruesome enforcer, all the more when he opens his mouth. Giselle Itié and Charisma Carpenter have little to do but yell and be sultry as the film's ignored female presence, and even the much vaunted icon cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are too brief and gratuitous to derive any enjoyment from. As such it is up to Mickey Rourke to flagrantly walk away with the film as a cheerfully world-weary tattoo artist. Rising head and shoulders above the general quality on display with an infectious charm and delivering an unexpectedly harrowing monologue, Rourke's performance proves testament to the potential for talent to peek its head out even amidst torrents of inescapable dross. <br/><br/>As incongruous as it might sound to quote Shakespeare in a context where most characters would rather do their speaking through blazing bullets, seldom before has the phrase ""full of sound and fury signifying nothing"" been so applicable to a major motion picture. There lies a finite line between ""so bad it's good"" guilty pleasure and ""too bad to extract any base line enjoyment from"", yet The Expendables proves an expert only at epitomizing the latter, managing to deftly dance around any shred of fun, excitement, irony or bombastic enjoyment whatsoever. Paradoxically, rather than lovably reigniting the '80s (as the year's earlier hit The A-Team achieved), The Expendables articulates everything about why cinematic trends moved away from the boneheaded aesthetics of the decade's action films in the first place. <br/><br/>-4/10"

","***SPOILER ALERT****<br/><br/>What happened Sly? How can the writer of 'Rocky', just to name a few, and such a talented director mess up so badly. I've always been a Stallone fan, looking past his 80's action hero typecast and given him credit when its due. However, this was an awful film, mostly for the 3 reasons listed below:<br/><br/>1) Gunner Jensen (Lundgren) had a very touching death scene towards the middle of the film due to his betrayal of Barney Ross (Stallone). As an act of redemption, he gave pivotal information to Barney regarding the enemy's layout, simply if Barney fulfills this request, ""You'll bury me, right?"" This touching moment was ruined completely when Gunner was shown alive and well during the BS sugar coated ending. He was shot 2 inches away from his heart, there's no way this could happen!<br/><br/>2) The annoying macho guy to guy bantering. OK, we get it, you're tough guys, but yet you want to portray that they pick on one another lightheartedly, blah blah. But one or two of these moments is enough, but it just kept continuing!! <br/><br/>3) The horrendous use of CGI blood! It was so overdone. How expensive are squibs?? <br/><br/>Sly, you disappointed me on this one. <br/><br/>P.S. Schwarzenegger's cameo was painful to watch. I'm a die hard fan of the man, but he only acts well under certain direction/directors. Ivan Reitman, James Cameron, and John Milius to name a few. Sly should have known this. During this cameo of his, his bantering was so forced, illogical. Additionally, the camera kept cutting back to these unnecessary close ups of Arnold as he said another poorly delivered line, followed by a smirk of some sort. <br/><br/>This was a bad film, Statham was good though."

It was a long time coming and didn't disappoint(although I wondered how Willis would appear alongside them-and given the short time they probably had to film-its not quite the three of them on screen ""together""). Still a great classic scene.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself--it was OK-had some one liners, action, had some throwback to the 80s moments, but it was a little on the cheap side--I would have expected a big action finale back on the home turf--and it could have used stronger-more caricatured villains.<br/><br/>The action scenes were rather generic. Lundgren was decent in his part-I think Van Damme would probably have felt the part too much of a supporting character. This is a case of star power smoothing over the rough edges so i give the film a bit more slack (especially since it did get me out into a theater after almost a decade due to its 'stunt' casting)."

Sure, the plot is mindless but SO WHAT?

I even love that they didn't fall victim to a pet peeve of mine. I hate it when a guy whips out a knife in the middle of a gun battle for no reason. Every knife used was used for a reason or in lieu of reloading. Gun battles were fierce and wild but actually not too over-the-top. I'd have to say that ""guy movie"" perfection was hit in the catacombs/tunnel sequence Steven Seagal type arm snapping, Jet Li VS Ray Park, overwhelming action and I swear even Rocky Balboa showed up for a moment!

","Being a child of the 80's and early 90's I was a big fan of the kind of action film this movie is throwing itself back to. You know the ones with giant action stars that we had posters and action figures of. The kind of films with senseless violence where everyone in the background of all the action scenes got killed. Te ones with nifty one liners where you never took the plot too seriously but relished the kill scenes because they were amazingly over the top. Like body slams with bone breaking and decapitations. Now looking back on it they were pretty much like slasher flicks but on different level of course. I'm a huge fan of the films that came out in my youth and they made me into the fan I am today. Of course my tastes have progressed but I still love a balls out carnage fest and thats exactly what the expendables. forget the plot, the acting or even the surprisingly funny screenplay. Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Willis, Schwarzenegger, some wrestlers and hell even Crews. The Expendables is a gory, 100% American action fest. When the film stops to build any type of type of actual story it begins to stall a little but it's a good thing there is some much action and explosiveness at that. Decapitations, knife fights, giant guns, missiles, diving from fire, planes and building blowing, two giant guys demolishing each other, martial arts, one liners and if thats not enough Eric Roberts as a slimy villain it's all good fun and done with a winking eye. It's a hell of ride with more substance than you'd expect and surprising amount of good chemistry between its stars. Good stuff!"
"PlugInYourBrain","4","3","6","29 July 2012"," ""These CGI flames are making me thirsty""
","This should have been a great movie. Instead we got a remake of Arnie's ""Commando"" that takes itself too seriously.<br/><br/>""The Expendables"" does have an all-star cast, but many of those are all-too-short cameos. While this adds a novelty value, it also breaks the suspension of disbelief and inevitably leaves you disappointed when those big names never return. I expected Bruce and Arnie parachuting onto the island with them. Instead we never see them again. In a sense, this leaves the audience feeling cheated because that wasn't what the movie promised.<br/><br/>The action is poorly filmed. Yes, it's shaky cam, but it also follows a recent trend in filming fights with disorienting close-ups so you're never sure what is going on. Nor do you care. The characterizations are poorly handled. <br/><br/>There's no attempt to introduce characters, and many of the actors have an air of smugness as if their mere presence on screen is a treat for the audience. I hate to break it to them but while there are some big names here, others are still largely unknown. As many of them sport bald heads it's hard to tell them apart. They could have called this movie ""Stallone and a bunch of Bald Guys."" The few attempts at humor fall flat. They could have had a lot of fun with the fact most of the actors here are old men, but they take themselves far too seriously for that and run around as if they're 20 year olds.<br/><br/>There's a lot of CGI. Some of it is clearly fake. When Road (Couture) falls into a flame-filled trench one can only think ""These CGI flames are making me thirsty."" There's a lot of CGI violence like people ripped in half, but it's so clearly fake it didn't bother me.<br/><br/>The plot is unimaginative and predictable. There is zero suspense. The sole twist is unconvincing. So is the idea that Stallone would return for a woman where there was no evident attraction and then leave so quickly at the end when he didn't have to.<br/><br/>I don't blame the actors for this (except for Stallone who directed it), but it does show that while these actors may be big names, much of their on-screen talent comes from the director and the film crews that bring them to life. Compare the flat performances here with what James Cameron did for Arnie in ""True Lies,"" but this movie shows that Sylvester Stallone is no James Cameron. Only credit here I give here is to Mickey Rourke who does try and inject some humanity into his usual d-bag role.<br/><br/>""The Expendables"" promises an all-star fun-filled outing, but it's a poorly made movie which doesn't deliver. Yet with a cast like this it literally couldn't fail and earned an undeserved $275M at the box office on its $80M budget. If you wonder why so many bad movies are being made, this is why; they make money regardless. The inevitable sequel will be out August 2012. I hope that Simon West who replaces Stallone as Director does a better job and can make a success of what should be a great franchise."

"WilderMovieReviews","10","3","6","19 March 2012"," Action movies really don't get any better than this.
","When I first heard about this film I had really high expectations. Sylvester Stallone writing, directing and starring in an action film. He was trying to bring together some of the greatest stars of action films past and present, it sounded too good to be true. As the months went by I kept hearing rumours as to who was in it. Pretty much every name from action films was mentioned. Then the biggest rumour of them all, it was going to star Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger! Never gonna happen I thought. I was never so glad to be wrong. The scene they appeared in may only be a few minutes long but it was perfect.<br/><br/>I went to see this film the week it came out. The cinema was fairly full, and as the film started I noticed something about the audience, they were loving the movie. As the film continued it started to feel like I was seeing this in my living room with a large group of friends. Everyone was laughing, gasping and really getting into the spirit of the film. This really added something special to the film. I have not experienced this during a normal screening of a film.<br/><br/>The film itself follows a very basic formula, big characters, big explosions, big guns and lots of bad guys dying. But what makes this one stand out from modern action films is it doesn't try to be anything more. It is a throw back to the great action films from the 80's and 90's like Commando, Predator, Die Hard and Rambo: First Blood Part II. Films that are so over the top but so very entertaining.<br/><br/>The cast is an action movie fans wet dream. Action movie legends Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren Gary Daniels and Mickey Rourke star alongside modern day action stars Jason Statham, Jet Li, Steve Austin, Randy Couture and Terry Crews. Add to the cast Eric Roberts, David Zayas and Charisma Carpenter and you have probably the greatest cast assembled since Ocean's Eleven was remade in 2001. The cast works well. I always believe that if the cast had a good time making a movie then it will show in their performance. They must have had the time of their lives filming this.<br/><br/>A film like this will never get any major awards (it did win awards for the stunt work), but then again you don't go to see this looking for award winning performances. You go to see this to escape from the reality of life and to just be entertained. I am a major action movie fan and it really doesn't get any better than this."
"movieevangelist","7","3","6","25 January 2011"," Review: The Expendables
","The Pitch: The Magnificent Four And A Half.<br/><br/>The Review: I think I was born at just the wrong age. I was two when Rocky came out, and still at primary school when Arnie was first flexing his biceps for the camera. I did grow up on a diet of action, but it was Die Hard and Robocop that helped shape my formative years. But as action movies, driven by those late Eighties classics, have evolved and grown more complex over the last thirty years, I've come to appreciate the dumber things in life. While I like to be intellectually challenged by some of my viewing, once in a while you just need to see stuff get blown up real good.<br/><br/>So thank goodness for Sylvester Stallone. He's managed to find ways to extend his Rambo and Rocky series well past their natural lifespans, but especially in Rocky's case he's tried to find a different perspective with age. There is a part of the audience for these movies though, in which I shamelessly include myself, that longs for the succession of cheesy one liners and men shooting things until they explode. Forget character development and intricate plot developments – and by and large Stallone has, in a return to old school action movie making.<br/><br/>The concept felt fairly high to start with – cram as many action movie stars, old and new, onto the screen and let them have fun. Sensibly, the central team isn't too numerous, with the big names evenly divided across the good, the bad and the morally ambivalent, but only a few get any real screen time. The highlights are Jason Statham for the good guys, who Stallone seems to have recognized uses his charisma to cover up his acting deficiencies, but who uses his particular Transporter-style fighting to the best effect in the many, many, many fights and brawls. For the bad guys, Eric Roberts chews the scenery and spits it in every direction, probably about the only one to find just the right tone. Mercifully, Stallone avoids the ageist navel-gazing that ultimately crippled the likes of the Lethal Weapon series, but there is still slightly too much contemplation at times. Come on, blow something up, will ya? Don't get me wrong, it's by no means perfect. The action scenes vary from the pretty good to the I- don't- understand- what- just- happened- because- you-can't- shoot- or- edit- properly, Stallone's attempts to add emotional resonance, mainly in scenes with Mickey Rourke, have all the depth of the shallow end of a paddling pool and are about as enjoyable, a joke about Jet Li's height wears so thin you can see through it and there isn't a truly iconic action sequence that will stand the test of time. But it does deliver just enough big muscles, big explosions and giant pulsating stupidity to be a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>Why see it at the cinema: Actually, if you want an action movie to watch this summer, try The A Team. You can watch that any time. The Expendables should only be seen on a Friday or Saturday night, with a willing crowd who are as drunk as possible. That is a recommendation, in case you were wondering.<br/><br/>The Score: 7/10"

","What happens when you take almost every action star who has been in at least one bad movie and put them together; you get a bad movie. Stallone directed and help write this film and it was not up to par at all. Now I am not a total hater of this film. I am sure it was interesting seeing Stallone's old skin in slow motion when he was running. But the film could of been better. The cast was fun to see. I loved seeing the newer action stars and the old ones work together. Even the cameos were great. The dialog for the most part was just as pathetic as the story. Pretty much just like the old action films you remember seeing. There were a few funny lines in the film though, so it did get a little of a laugh out of me. Now lets talk about the thing that the movie advertised; the action. Yes it had the action that was promised. All the cool fight scenes, bones breaking and gore. But some old action stars cannot move that fast so what do they do, they shake the camera. This really makes the viewer lose interest. Plus personally, I think there could of been more action. They did have a lot of serious scenes and with that dialog, it was pretty bad. Now, I don't know who was in charge of the CG, but it looked like something with a low budget. An example is a scene with Steve Austin. I would think with a hype like this, they could of made it look more real. All in all I enjoyed the film in bits and pieces. Also even thought I didn't enjoy the film all the way, just like the old action films, the movie did give off the man movie of the year. I don't know if it was Jet Li breaking someones neck or Terry Crews and his gun that kept me smiling at parts; you can see I liked it some. One thing really was on my mind when the movie ended though. I couldn't figure out who was uglier at their old age; Stallone or Rourke."
"blacklist-1","1","5","13","10 September 2010"," Even the action hero greats can't save this crap.
","The Expendables trailer advertised specifically what it was meant to in the movie. Just trashy fun with lots of explosions and a hot woman. With total disregards to story and character development and even a cheesy script I wouldn't have minded as certain actors in films most notably Jason Patric as the main villain who was entertaining in The Losers and The A-Team film with Liam Nesson and Sharlto Copley etc hamming it up and taking the script for what it was.<br/><br/>Now some people have said that other reviewers don't get this movie and that it advertises honestly what it says on the tin, action oh yes that is all well and good but it's impossible to enjoy the action if the camera angles change so quickly as the editing is so frenetic with the camera constantly jerking up and down so much so all I saw was things and people flying across the screen not knowing who or what it was coming from which direction. For example the scene at the start where Jet Li, Stallone and Statham are standing on the deck of the ship looking down at the bad guys. Then suddenly they're standing on level with them even though the drop is fifty feet. Now one assumes as they are ex military, that they climbed down using ropes but we never saw them get it out, so it's as though they just jumped down and didn't injure themselves. Such an amendment in the script of adding a simple prop to enhance realism makes this film reek of laziness. Another scene is when Stallone and Li are in a grey pick up truck being chased. One minute they are ahead of the red truck, which contains more bad guys shooting at them and then next the red truck is in front. Presumably it drove past but the camera switches and turns so quickly and constantly it's impossible to keep track of anything happening on screen. so it's as though by magic it disappeared and reappeared like a magic trick. Unfortunately Stallone seems to have developed the annoying trait of Michael Bay of not being able to shoot an action scene (just watch the terrible Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to know what I'm getting at). I could go on with several other examples but I think you get the point.<br/><br/>Mentioning earlier of the failure to add a simple prop of a rope to show how the leads jumped from the deck of a ship to the bottom. The script is of course awful and unimaginative and yes it is cheesy though, but it contains little laughs. The only scene I did like was with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis which was funny but too short. Stallone apparently drafted the script hundred times before he settled for the one to put into production. I hate to imagine what the first ninety nine were like. In terms of the characters, yes they are cardboard with no depth to them but they never come to life, not like in The A-Team where they actors look like they are enjoying themselves and as a result the audience enjoy it more too. This had the opposite but inevitable effect, the actors looked bored so do we and don't even get me started with the acting. Stallone just mumbles his lines and on some extreme close up shots looks more and more like his mother (and I don't mean that as a compliment). He just looked grizzled and washed out and maybe a sure sign it's about time he retired from acting and directing. Jet Li and Jason Statham don't figure any better and Micky Rourke is at his worst again from Iron Man 2. The only actors I did like were Bruce Willis and Arnie. But they were only in that one scene for about a minute so why did they get advertised as having main parts in the movie? It's beyond me. <br/><br/>Now as I said there are a few good moments with the comedy scene in the church and even I did enjoy one fight scene where Statham beat up some guys in the park, but really this was just boring, unimaginative tripe with even the violence being tasteless. All I really did enjoy was the fact I didn't pay to see this (though I certainly wasted my time) and when I walked out when the film ended. Do yourself a favour and see another action film like Salt or the ones I mentioned The Losers or The A-Team, they are much better, not this overblown and overrated trash, a 7.1 on the IMDb ratings! What a joke! Unfortunately alas it's not. This is one movie I won't watch again. The only place it belongs is in the garbage."
"JVMblaamaba","4","5","13","22 August 2010"," Expendables Destroys All High Expectations, the only real action!
","Very bad character development and cliché story but the action scenes are quite impressive while most of the film is a cross of mediocre and bad. The characters have very awkward and strange development and traits being grown throughout the film with very rushed development from almost every character. The only character that was very interesting and developing was Mickey Rourke's character, very underrated and developing character that was only in it for 15 mins or so and Mickey plays this character very well, I just wish he had more screen time. The story is basically Rambo 4 with humor and super cliché puns, by the way the movie had constant puns. The writing is mediocre and I wouldn't say I didn't understand what most of the characters were saying because I could totally understand the dialogue but with heavy accents of course. The cinematography and visuals were just fine, pretty standard while the CGI and special effects were just terrible, there is a scene where a character catches on fire... and it looks like a kid was using an old special effects system on the character, the fire looked so fake and really dull as well as the other CGI explosions. The high points of this movie is the action scenes, very creative and interesting. The love story between Stallone and the main girl really didn't do anything through out the film, it should have been removed from the story overall. Most of the characters never develop and most of them could be removed from the movie. Overall, its not the greatest film but I kind of figured from Stallone that this movie would be mediocre and just fine, which happened. Not bad but not good either."
"Robert_duder","8","5","13","18 August 2010"," Their is plenty good, and probably plenty bad but one of my most anticipated films of 2010 darn well entertained!!
","I think I could write a whole book on The Expendables so bare with me while I reduce it to IMDb friendly size. I love Sly Stallone. I've been a huge fan of his for years and years since I was a young lad. I think he's one of the greatest action stars of all time and I was on pins and needles taking in every detail of his newest film. So my expectations were anything but low but I also knew exactly what to expect from this film as well. Anyone going in thinking they are going to see anything more than what they promise shouldn't see the film. Massive explosions, bulging muscles, action stars, cameos, gun fire, blood, violence, gratuitous everything (except nudity perhaps surprisingly.) A dictator in a foreign country, mercenaries, and a sleazy villain. All of these come in at break neck speed. The action is so brutal and non stop that it leaves you breathless and cleverly and appropriately hides the films negative aspects. The cheese is in place and purposely so I have no doubt. This was meant to be Stallone's homage to everything action and mostly from the 80's when he was in his prime and you couldn't possibly have an homage to 80's action without plenty of cheese.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone still knows how to impress his audience. He knows what people want and he delivers it...still to this day. He knows the red blooded 20-30 something males want to see people being ridiculously eviscerated regardless of reality or story. His character could definitely use some more depth. I would love to find out more of his back story and where he came from and how he puts together his team. But regardless of that he still looks awesome and does his proper role. Perhaps the best action star of the current generation is Jason Statham so it definitely makes sense to have him in the film as runner up to Stallone. Statham gives a solid performance and is a little less dark than he is in some of his other roles. I really wanted Stallone and Statham to have wicked chemistry and it isn't bad but it isn't as good as it should be for this type of film. Eric Roberts is actually the perfect 80's action flick villain. I would have liked to have seen more of him but he was absolutely great. He was one of the best characters in the film. Jet Li is decent but very underused as one of the members of The Expendables. I hope he gets a lot more depth and use in future sequels (oh yah baby get ready for them.) He also rarely does his trademark Martial Arts. Dolph Lundgren is terrific and actually gets the most depth out of his character ironically and even that isn't much. The battle with Lundgren and Li is great but where was the Stallone/Lundgren fight?? The person I thought I could do the most without was Mickey Rourke (I'm not a fan) but imagine my surprise when he actually turned in one of the best and most emotional performances. He doesn't even get into the action but is like the heart of the team. I would love to see him come back for future instalments. Now here is the list of 'main' characters that could be completely removed or replaced and you would never notice...Randy Couture, Steve Austin, and Terry Crews. I know I left some performances out but I only have so much room and I have more to say. And finally to the much talked about cameos and meeting of the three masters Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger. Yes the scene was very small. But it was also effective and fun. I mean Stallone did the impossible...he California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to play a role...it was small of course but there was even some back story there. And the direction of the character was well done and the witty repertoire between the three of them was fun as well. I think peoples expectations of the scene were far too high. We can always hope Willis will return for a bigger role next time.<br/><br/>The Expendables is far from a perfect film. The character depth is practically non existent and I wanted to know more about them. The film was mega hyped as this massive collaboration of huge action stars but let's be real...it may have started that way but in the end you have Stallone and Statham, Li as maybe a supporting big action star, Lundgren perhaps but fighters and athletes and pro-wrestlers don't equal big action stars. Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Willis (in a full role), VanDamme, Seagal, Snipes, Gibson, Cruise, Weathers, Norris (and I can't stand Chuck Norris), Nolte, Eastwood, Bronson (yah he's dead)...that would be an ensemble action cast. Still I have no complaints about the film as an action flick. The body count was huge and the 'R' rating was firmly in tact and that is the way it should be. Many will hate The Expendables but you have to take it for why Stallone created it and for that reason the film is a man lovin' action masterpiece and I for one am cheering out loud that Stallone gets his comeback especially at this age. 8.5/10"
"DICK STEEL","8","5","13","17 August 2010"," A Nutshell Review: The Expendables
","Forget about the naysayers, for action fans it's time to celebrate one of our wildest action film wet dream casting on screen with an ensemble of screen heroes uniting mostly in cooperative mode and collectively taking down faceless, nameless goons led by villains you know that are just going down for the count. It's Rambo and The Transporter with Wong Fei Hong amongst a pack of guns for hire in black operations, hired by anyone who comes with a bagful of dough and needs to get a dirty job done. It's the A-Team, only with an A-list membership consisting of some of the best action stars of our generation.<br/><br/>Who would've imagined that a film like this can be pulled off, since action stars usually like to marquee their own films for that ego boost of one versus impossible odds thrown their way. But never say never, and Sly Stallone as director managed to get the likes of Jason Statham and Jet Li as headliners, joined by Dolph Lundgren, Steve Austin, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, and speaking roles for Mickey Rourke, with Bruce Willis and even the Gov'nor Arnold Schwarzenegger making time to appear in an uncredited cameo, in a film where Sly had a role in crafting the screenplay, and the opportunity of being the unofficial leader of the pack.<br/><br/>Story wise, I've got to admit it's nothing but the bare basics in providing an excuse to put everyone together, and it balances some real world wish list such as the attack on Somali pirates alongside silver screen fantasy with the taking down of a dictatorship in a fictional island state that had gone rogue with what else but American bad influence and money, courtesy of the characters played by Eric Roberts and henchmen Austin. Somehow it's more fun to use the actors real names than the characters they play, since each individual have achieved larger than life status, and heck, it's just more fun that way.<br/><br/>Structurally, most of the action takes place in the beginning and the finale, while in between we get fillers such as the inevitable dramatic moments where we have to witness Stallone and Rourke reminisce their past lives and provides for a guilt trip to catalyze the mission, Statham having to wrestle a romantic relationship gone awry, and Stallone and Statham demonstrating their BFF status with their constant ribbing. It's logical of course that they feature together almost throughout the film given their primary star billing, with Statham given a rather sexier caricature boost as the user of knives, and boy does he let it rip.<br/><br/>Jet Li too has his own field day, although his fighting prowess has been dumbed down quite a bit from what we are used to, and just barely veering clear of being the butt of self- deprecating jokes that makes his character Ying Yang (seriously Sly, a better name please?) come across as money-centric to solve some unexplained family issues. As one of the leading names of the film, he has relatively significant screen time as well, with an action sequence involving himself, Stallone and Lundgren, and some wicked cooperative fisticuffs together with Statham, where they had twice been on opposite sides in films like The One and War/Rogue Assassin.<br/><br/>Action wise, it's unadulterated violence through and through, where the first shot ever fired in the film involves a complete separation of torso. The Expendables employ just about everything from cargo plans fitted with machine guns to van chases for variety, and having its characters equally adept at breaking limbs with basic martial arts, possessing edged weapons that dismembers, slices and dices, and mowing down opponents with a spectrum of rifles and machine guns that punctures bodies to look like cheese. Heck, even Stallone's character is a self-styled Caucasian equivalent of India's Quick Gun Murugan! Mind it!<br/><br/>In some ways I thought The Expendables followed what I felt was 80s styled HOng KOng action flicks where guns aside, there is always room for heroes go fist to fist with the villains during a finale. I'm not sure why some have said it's hard to figure out who's punching who, so seriously, don't sit so close to the screen. It's tough for an ensemble film to split screen time equally to allow everyone to shine and look good, and expectedly this outing is a little bit skewed toward the three main stars, and both Couture and Crews having just about a scene each to shine and demonstrate just what they can do.<br/><br/>But despite all the action and promise of explosive mayhem, the best scene hands down will be the meeting of minds between three iconic 80s/90s action heroes and rivals Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger in a church, with countless of comical references letting it fly between the three that it warrants a second viewing just to catch them all again. Never has anyone seen them sharing the same frame together, and this scene along is the money shot well worth the price of an admission ticket.<br/><br/>Now if a sequel is in the pipeline, can I say to include one of more of the following such as the Muscle from Brussels Jean Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Jackie Chan (hey, I believe Stallone and him are on first name basis), Sammo Hung, Kurt Russell, Donnie Yen, Dwayne Johnson, Colin Chou and having Bruce Willis do more than just talk? Man, it'll be action film wet dream come true again, part deux."

","Interesting, funny, witty, entertaining, educating - these reviews are great! Way more fun than the movie! I have had hours of fun reading the reviews, gave the movie a 2 because it is the cause of all this banter. Otherwise, Stallone had a great idea and cast. Time for an intervention. Too cliché for words; if there was a script, we couldn't hear or understand it. If there was cinematography, it was too close and shaky to view. If there was a story line it was cut out. If there were great actors, they were hobbled. If there was chemistry, if fizzled. If there is a reason for Part 2, it is to get it right! Suggestions: How about adding a twist? How about using a tripod? How about the actors speaking lines, maybe adding up to a plot? How about men acting age-appropriate? How about adding an older woman who kicks their asses? Why are all Stallone's women all helpless victims? How about an army of empowered women out thinking the retirees? Why is there no sexuality in this movie? How much Viagra could this bunch use, they can fight over that! That alone would give older women something real to fight over - to stop the oldsters from 5 hour extended sessions. Just a thought!"
"solanki17","8","4","10","31 August 2010"," Old school violence no CGI, No pretencions for Oscars & Awards, just good old fashioned action !
","So I finally got there in the end. Ever since last year when I first heard about this movie my blood's been pumping and the sheer mention of the words ""expendables"", ""Stallone"", ""Jet Li"" or ""Couture"" have sent a shiver down my spine and got the Goosebumps raised.<br/><br/>It was hard to keep a level head and not be excited for a 30 year old man who grew up on old school action movies like Rambo, Die Hard, Predator, Universal Soldier and more recently Crank & Transporter. All these movies have a common theme and ingredient. Non stop action centred around a hero or hero(s), women unable to defend themselves and a pretty flimsy plot. Usually the main character has little emotional background or epic dialogue sequences. But what these movies do deliver is pure unadulterated action in bucket loads. Ingredients of Guns, violence, blood, profanity and a little sprinkle of sex usually only provided by a screaming half dressed lady ! it's what I grew up on and that is all I expected & wanted from The Expendables. In a day and age when action movies have become about deeply enriching plots and complex characters like The Bourne series (which I love), Matrix Trilogy, Inception or even The Dark Knight we can all see the way the genre is going. So I think Stallone has gathered the best he can with the tools he has. Mickey Rourke supplies the wise old man role and has a small hand full of scenes, Jason Staham, Stallone & Jet Lie probably share the most screen time together (more so Statham & Stallone) and this makes sense as its Stallone's movie and Statham & Li are the biggest names in the movie that are current action stars with actual big roles. Both have integral roles, Statham is like Stallone's right hand man and conscious. Jet Li is the comedy relief unfortunately his height and Chinese background is the butt of most the jokes. Randy Couture has little to do but does it well as does Terry Crews. Steve Austin & Eric Roberts were born to play villains and again deliver the big baddie in bucket loads. The two female characters in the movie (Statham's girl & Stallone's love interest) have one task to do, look pretty and helpless and they both do that perfectly with a bit of cleavage thrown in for good measure. One of the biggest surprises has to be the 53 year old Dolph Lungren who plays one of the expendables who goes AWOL, Gunnar. To be honest one of the big major gripes with this movie is the incomprehensible dialogue delivered by most the actors. You have actors like Jet Li & Dolph Lungren given quite a bit of dialogue when English was never their first language and then you have other brutes who just grunt and groan their lines including Stallone, Rourke & Steve Austin. By now I'm sure most of you know the plot. Bunch of mercenaries are hired to liberate a South American country from its evil dictator who in turn is actually controlled by a more evil American villain (Eric Roberts). Initially the leader of the mercenaries, Barney Ross aka Sly Stallone does a little recon of the country and he is entranced by a rather good looking local woman probably half his age ! anyway Statham & Sly just escape the island before their recon is finished and decide against taking the suicidal job of liberating this country. That is until Sly has a little chat with an EX-Expendable (another 80's star) Mickey Rourke. Who convinces him you should never leave a women in distress. So after returning to the island with his full expendables crew to rescue the girl and save a nation. We are led from one boy hood playground dream debate to another. UFC Vs wrestling who would win? well Couture Vs Stone Cold Steve Austin puts an end to that. There are funny comedic moments like when Austin has Stallone held prisoner and is questioning him ""Who sent You?"" Stallone replies ""Your hairdresser"" no doubt to tease the fact Austin has no hair, oh Stallone we can clearly see you were in charge of the dialogue ! Of course we all know what happens at the end, Stallone & his gang obviously save the island and the damsel in distress. As for the much talked about and much hyped scene between Stallone & Willis with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger well I'll save that to say its well worth the ticket price alone and is cinema gold. Many reviews have said about the whole movie the storyline is weak, the acting terrible, character development poor and the dialogue just plain stupid. An action movie should never be about the dialogue or character development. You don't go into an ice cream parlour and judge it by the Hot Chocolate they serve so why judge an Action movie against the criteria you would judge an Intricate Thriller. The Expendables isn't pretending to be The godfather or Seven Samurai or even Gran Torino so don't judge it by it. It's an Action Movie judge it against other Action movies. I even read Stallone is doing a terrible job of trying to be Clint Eastwood in being an actor come director. Come on please! When people deserve to die he doesn't just pump them full of lead he makes sure they feel pain with a blade or some other form of long suffering death, exactly what you want from an action movie. So if you want old school violence no CGI, No pretencions for Oscars & Awards and probably no repeat viewing apart from needing subtitle switched on then this is the S**T for you, I would have given it 9 if Segal, Snipes had made it in the picture, if Van Damme was in it it would have got 10 for sure! BRING ON THE SEQUEL IS WHAT I SAY!"
"Bobby747","7","4","10","30 August 2010"," You get exactly what you're expecting
","Going into this movie I expected gory ultra-violence, tongue-in-cheek jokes based on careers, intermittent and absurd one-liners, and a lot of explosions. That is exactly what you get when you watch this movie. The plot is well enough to prevent the feeling that you're just watching a series of explosions, however the action is clever and the dialogue is really what you would expect. And with most of the major action stars from the past two decades, having realistic expectations going in, I was very pleased with this movie.<br/><br/>The CGI in certain parts were pretty flawed, but I found the movie so entertaining as a whole that it didn't make me lose interest. This is just a really good action movie. Definitely worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Another thing, is that I find that I really miss the old '90s action movies. Action movies with over-the-top, while sometimes dry, humour and the gratuitous nature in any way that might get someone excited. Maybe this is a sign that those kinds of movies will begin being made again.<br/><br/>I give this movie 7/10 which is a very good rating for me."
"inic-nemanja","8","4","10","30 August 2010"," actually, more than I expected
","When I heard that this sort of movie, with mega-stars is being filmed, I thought that it's gonna be a pile of c(junk). The storyline isn't that bad, and the fighting scenes are fan-bloody-tastic (except for the tower blowing parts). First the stuff I didn't like. The Monroe dude, he just wears too much make up. And the scene with Schwartzie and Bruce too (why in heaven's sake did they put that in the movie, it's too excessive). The rest is fairly good. And the shooting and fighting scenes are... just... breathtaking. Splendid. Statham did a wonderful job, Lee too, Stallone did OK, but I really hoped to see Rourke in action. Lundgren's role is, without exaggeration, strange. Also I didn't like the mistreating of the Serbs in the movie (they could've inserted a more recent U.S. foe), and the Spanish. But the rest of the movie was a classical hard-core action movie, the kind that wasn't seen in movie theaters in years. Good job."
"jan_kalina","8","4","10","28 August 2010"," ""You Look Nervous""
","Great. Awesome. Jaws-dropping. Even beautiful. All these words can be used to describe this movie. Sylvester Stallone has done it; he made a movie for all the action fans. He gave them what they wanted, a good old-fashioned (80's) action with minimum CGI and bunch of guys beating the crap out of each other either by fists or with fire weapons.<br/><br/>It quite surprised me that this movie actually had a plot. I thought that this will be just about a group of mercenaries just killing people but it was a little bit more than that.<br/><br/>The Church Scene: That's one of the reasons you all are going to see this movie and I assure that this scene is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo is one of the best cameos in movie history. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are both trying to steal the scene for themselves but Arnold wins. It's just so great to see him on screen again. This scene will decide if you will like the movie or not because if you are not smiling from the beginning 'till the end of this scene this movie might not be for you.<br/><br/>The cast Sly got in this movie is amazing. Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham are practically the leads and they have/share the most of the screen time. Terry Crews is probably the third best character from The Expendables after Sly and Jason. His scenes with him and ""his big bullet-exploding gun"" are pure genius, pure awesomeness. Mickey Rourke's character steals every single scene he is in. He is awesome<br/><br/>Brian Tyler's soundtracks always sounds so, sorry for the word, expendable. Now he has two exceptions: Eagle Eye and Expendables.<br/><br/>The action scenes could have been a little more creative but that's the only thing I have to point out. Overall this is a fun action (80's style) movie which is set to delight action fans all over the world. Solid 8 out of 10."

","A gang of mercenaries (Stallone, Statham, Li, Couture and Crews) take on and single handedly destroy a Colombian army led by rogue CIA agent Eric Roberts and his two bodyguards Stone Cold Steve Austin and Gary Daniels, while Lundgren is kicked out of said gang and turns against his former comrades. The Expendables is a lot of fun, indeed i'm amazed at the reviews this has gotten. Indeed this is pretty much what you would expect, the story is right out of the Golan and Globus play-book, the acting is actually better than that and while the fight sequences rely too heavily on the shaky camera such doesn't take too much away from the choreography or the fact that the Lundgren Vs Li is a highlight. The rest of the action is very well staged and quite exciting. The climax in particular though is what gives The Expendables it's high marks, whether it be throwing a missile and exploding it, or the automatic shotgun this has all the hallmarks of goofy 80s action. Indeed my only complaint would be Lundgren's scant time (hopefully in the sequel he'll get to cut loose) and the way Li's martial artistry wasn't as exploited as it should've been. Other than that this is highly enjoyable stuff and really you get what you pay for. In a time when action cinema doesn't even deliver on the action and body-count (Usually long exposition for 80% of the movie) The Expendables is refreshing to see, It's also nice to see that the stars of our youth still have it. It's no Wild Bunch, but then really what is. Count me in for the sequel and hopefully Stallone recruits Arnold (for more of a part), Van Damme,Norris, Seagal and Michael Dudikoff. <br/><br/>* * * out of 4-(Good)"
"jesterification","8","4","10","24 August 2010"," I feel like a little girl again. :)
","I'm an 80s girl so I grew up watching most of the cast including Jet Li in his earliest works. Seeing all of these guys plus new gen action heroes like Jason Statham on the same screen at the same time was pretty much a dream come true.<br/><br/>To start, I just want to say that we don't really watch action movies for any sort of compelling plot. I have no illusions about that so The Expendables' lack of said compelling plot doesn't particularly disappoint me. Still, I have to say props to Mickey Rourke for somehow, when you least expect it, drawing the viewer into this senselessly violent world and making something human of it. I've never gotten misty eyed at an action flick before, this was the first time.<br/><br/>Generally, the cast was colourful and entertaining, I enjoyed their idiosyncrasies and Stallone's willingness to take potshots about his age. His age definitely was showing in this film, (though I am relieved to see that his arms aren't so grotesquely enormous this time around *cough*RamboIV*cough*) but he still retains a kind of gritty, lumbering charm that many of us Rambo fans know and love.<br/><br/>I really liked what was planned with the action scenes but I have no love or praise for the camera work. I could only barely follow what was happening with the camera sweeping back and forth rapidly between characters and scenes in uncomfortable angles. The movie was fast-paced enough as it was and the camera didn't do it any justice. I think it was the only thing that really ruined it for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I was drawn into the funny and action-packed world of these soldiers of fortune. It was a pleasure to re-experience the same wide-eyed visual thrill-ride of my youth. Supposedly there's a sequel in mind, I have to admit I'm looking forward to it. :)"

","The advertising for this film has been a little misleading, so let's get it straight right from the off: The Expendables stars Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham. Supporting them are Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren,, Mickey Rourke, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, and Eric Roberts at his most reptilian. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenneger, despite the publicity, cameo for 5 minutes (during which Willis unnecessarily lets off the ""F"" bomb half a dozen times, the only point at which it features in the film). So what we have here is the Stallone and Statham show.<br/><br/>Stallone leads a group of (we are led to assume) mercenaries called (we are also led to assume) The Expendables - there is no exposition, although we do see them at the end of a previous mission before the movie proper starts. The main story concerns a mission to a Latin American island where the local corrupt military leader is in cahoots with an American drug lord. Having carried out a reconnoitre with the aid of the military bloke's daughter (and killed 41 soldiers and destroyed a vast amount of military kit), they turn the gig down, but go back (for free!) to rescue the girl, who is now being tortured by the bad American.<br/><br/>There are no surprises in this vague riff on The Magnificent Seven other than the inconsistent approach to violence - sometimes the approach is almost coy, sometimes it is very graphic, if brief. And, of course, the film is full of guns which fire hundreds of rounds before reloading, goodies who hit the target every time, baddies who couldn't hit a barn with a bazooka from five feet away and, frankly, the legendary blowing sh*t up. There is a brief attempt at giving Mickey Rourke some depth, but hang in there, because it's back to mayhem before you know it.<br/><br/>This movie is fun, if you like violent action thrillers. The characters are enjoyable, the script is light and amusing - I saw it in a full cinema with a predominantly young audience and there was frequent laughter in the right places - the action is well choreographed and frequent, and the denouement is satisfying. Stallone is wearing his age well and Statham is a suitably gritty action lead.<br/><br/>There isn't much heart to the movie, but it passes a couple of hours entertainingly enough."

","I thought this was ""fair"" overall, not really bad but not good, either. It could have been above-average had the filmmakers not gone over-the-top the last 20-30 minutes with way overdone action. Nothing new there, is it? These guys just don't know that too much action can actually get boring.<br/><br/>Thus, the first half of this film is much better, with a good cast of characters and some surprisingly-good humor. The insults here and there between stars Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham are fun to hear, and there is a great little cameo by one of the all-time greats of action films, Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>If you think Mickey Rourke has looked sleazy in some recent films (The Wrestler, Iron Man 2), ""you ain't't seen nothing' yet. I have to admit; he's always entertaining. Dolph Lundgren was great in here, too.<br/><br/>Summary: fair-to-good film but overdone non-stop action and Hollywood clichés that last 20-30 minutes downgrade the movie substantially and makes it a rental, not a keeper."
"Arashikage2","1","5","14","22 August 2010"," Nothing to see here.
","If you want to see mercenaries at work watch ""The Killer Elite"", if you want action watch ""Predator"", this movie has nothing to do with mercenaries nor with action. Its really sad to see action stars giving up all concept of action movies. Like 99% of the movies of the last decade you WILL walk out of the theater remembering nothing of what you watched, you have seen it all before made one thousand times better and with allot more point.<br/><br/>The dialog was really disgusting for me, no mercenaries, real people or respected movie characters would outer such nonsense or acted like this guys do. In one scene the merc. goes to a basketball court to beat up the guy that hit his girlfriend, when the other guys in the court hear what happened they side with the woman beater, WTF? and surprise the trained mercenary beats them all up. I think a cold killer mercenary would be the scum that hits women, now I don't know any mercs so I digress. The bad guy says real men don't beat women so he orders his lackey to beat and torture her thus proving his point of ordering it is not the same as doing it? some would disagree. The rest of the movie is just talking nonsense, explosions and shooting signifying nothing until the bad guys are dead and the good unscathed. I wasn't watching with extreme attention and I skipped a few parts, so maybe I had more things to say, but I'm sure someone else will mention them in another review.<br/><br/>In Predator there is a scene in witch the guys are shooting in the jungle: As the sergeant starts of, the rest of the team one by one walks in, guns blazing, emptying clip after clip after explosive round on the trees. After the onslaught is over the unearthing line ""We hit nothing"" is uttered. every time I watch it, it sends shivers down my spine and I've watched it allot of times. I'm writing this to show that I love action and war movies, sadly they make only one or two a year the last few years.<br/><br/>All the names appearing in this movie is just the gimmick of the movie to make a days work, money and power, you don't need to watch it.<br/><br/>Also, if you want to know what it really means to get shot in the shoulder watch ""The Killer Elite"", a very realistic movie that also shows how obsolete ninjas really are."

","Just got back from seeing this film and i was very mixed up what to expect by the reviews i have seen from it being to over hyped and it not delivering my expectations off the film.<br/><br/>But this film has all the potential off an action film and raising the bar right off the stand, mean like what you expect from an action film is explosives, fight scenes, fit birds (obviously this film doesn't deliver that prospect but with the amount off blood, explosive scenes, fight scenes who needs a fit bird) <br/><br/>The dialogue to this film is pretty much straight forward handed over a job go do it get it done roll on spending it back at home without a scratch. the film delivers a fair amount of one liners which i found really good timing and very funny (specially Sly and Arnold and Bruce's scene in the church)the film isn't too long or long winded at all.<br/><br/>The characters where well suited to their roles none of them went too over the top on what they would not do in over films kept clean and simple and didn't just pull out all the stops for this blockbuster.<br/><br/>The character i would say who stood out for me was Terry Cruz, even tho he wasn't much in the film he was good when he was on scene specially the ending in the tunnels sly showed a different aspect to actions films and still shows even tho they are older cast that they still know how to show the younger generation what its all about.<br/><br/>My rating on this film i think is a fair play, its not the best film i seen but its certainly up there with ones i think are, its definitely a blockbuster hit and is sure to make any bad day turn into a good one =]"
"Tom6253","10","5","14","15 August 2010"," Sly Hasn't Lost His Touch!
","With Stallone's drawing power in question, it has left many wondering how The Expendables will pan out. His recent revivals of both Rocky and Rambo were very well received by the general public, however, no evidence in the box-office suggests this. The latest Rocky and Rambo grossed an estimated $70M and $40M respectively. Even unadjusted for inflation, these films still failed to gross more than their originals from 25 and 30 years prior. Well, enough history. Let us talk Expendables.<br/><br/>From start to finish, this film is an absolute feel good movie. The action is absolutely fantastic, for there are plenty of fast moving, hard hitting fight scenes. Some more than others, but in typical Stallone fashion, the action will get your adrenaline pumping. Not since the last Rocky film, and more so, the older Rocky films, have I experienced that feeling of invincibility and manliness that only a Stallone flick can give you.<br/><br/>What makes this movie even more enjoyable is the ensemble cast. Not only is it an assembly of great action names, but as characters, they are very likable, and seem to each have a quality about them that is not overdone, but done just right. Watching this bad ass group of mercenaries on screen kinda gives the viewer a feeling of looking in at a family, or experiencing a kinship between one another. It comes across to me that Sly and co. have done just as much to show us the caring and closeness of these tough guys as opposed to a bunch of empty characters functioning only to advance plot as I seen in Rambo.<br/><br/>For everything that Sly did wrong with Rambo, he got right with the Expendables. Rambo is great for the violence; The Expendables is great for everything. I strongly suggest that you see this film. I promise, unlike most movies today that make you feel like crap afterwords, this movie will leave you with a smile on your face. It is not the seriousness of 2012 nor does it have to do with other worldly concerns. It is a fun movie that does what it is intended to do: Kick Ass!"

","I have been really looking forward to this movie for quite some time now. Luckily, I was able to attend a previewing one week before the official opening here in Holland.<br/><br/>Of course I have been watching and reading up on all the hype surrounding this movie. I knew critics were going to bash it and they did. I also knew that there would be a lot of flaming between lovers and haters.<br/><br/>Too bad none of them can see the big picture. I watch and can appreciate all kinds of movies. From simple to intellectual, from drama to action. Point is, you have to judge an movie on it's intentions. You don't expect lots of laughs at a serious drama movie. Nor will you expect an Oscar nomination for and a movie which is an ode to the 80's action.<br/><br/>Some people just don't understand the appeal of a one muscular man army, bringing death and spitting one-liners. Luckily, we do! Sly brings us a cast of the biggest action names of the last the 3 decades. Call it nostalgia, but it's just beautiful to see the heroes from the past and present. Even though, some look painfully old.<br/><br/>The story is simple. A group of mercenaries have to bring down a dictator. That's all I need to know really. The script isn't bad. It has lots of comedy and great one-liners in it. It does have some holes though and there are a few awkward moments in the film.<br/><br/>All the action sequences are great. Really violent as well. It does go over the top a bit, but luckily not too much. Too bad there are some really quick or shaky cuts. I hate that.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie has it flaws. A correct score would be a 7,5 but I gave it a 10. Why? Because I truly enjoyed myself during the film and I left smiling. There is still a place in this world for 80's action movies!"

Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews are the powerhouses of the team. Elite mercenaries who do dangerous missions and get paid for it. However, there was a member of the team who gets careless and ends up messing up. Whoever it was, I'm not saying. The action is nonstop, and there are some scenes that closely like some of Sly's earlier movies. The street scene resembles the 1986 movie ""Cobra"". He has another souped up classic Ford truck. Lundgren and Stallone starred in ""Rocky IV"". I guess you can call it a small reunion together. Well, it's true! This movie also stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis in small, minute roles.

","What separates The Expendables from other action films that revolve around a team working together (The Losers, Red, G.I Joe) and what also makes it better is the cast. While there are always other actors who could have been included, the film has a very strong cast who all play off one another well, that you can't help but enjoy the film because it knows that it is to entertain.<br/><br/>Sometimes films aim for just that and fail because they don't have the right ingredients but it is clear that Sylvester Stallone knows how to craft an action film. While his direction is not perfect, the story is well told and paced appropriately; its simple but is fun to watch.<br/><br/>The cast include Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Ludgren, Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts. All of whom are good in their roles and when the action kicks up, the film is blast. While there are certainly better action films to be found with better stories, developed characters and jaw-dropping action sequences, The Expendables is easy watch and will appeal to a wider audience.<br/><br/>Its not perfect, you can tell just from watching the trailer, but it is far better than what some critics make it out to be. Get a group of friends together to watch this and you have your evening made. This is entertaining from start to finish. Its everything it should be."

","This is what you get when you think of a movie where all the most badass action heroes in the world unite together to form the greatest action film of all time. This film doesn't need to focus on good acting, good screenplay, or any of that. Just put an awesome cast in there, and you know the movies automatically gonna be awesome! I mean the list is endless. Nobody beats these guys. Their the best around, nothings gonna ever keep them down.<br/><br/>The story is nothing to get excited over. Basically, a team of bad- asses called the Expendables are called in to save a ruined city being terrorized by terrorists. Stallone and his partner meet up with this girl, and escape in a hurry, leaving her behind. The enemy thinks they've won. But he left just to come back with his whole team for a rescue mission.<br/><br/>Just like in Rambo, it all comes down to the end, where most of the action is. Only its a little more organized than Rambo. In Rambo, body after body get mangled to bits. Don't get me wrong, I love that. But the Expendable's style is a little better. Every fatality in that movie just gives you goosebumps. At the beginning, I didn't really like it that much, it just went a little too slow. But once it gets started, its the coolest thing you'll ever see.<br/><br/>The true thing that makes this movie is the cast. If it were any other pair of guys, it wouldn't be as good. These guys are the true American bad-asses. Their the biggest, the baddest, and the best of all time, making this one of the greatest action film ever made."
"Sandcooler","8","3","7","21 December 2010"," Exactly what you would expect
","In a way this throwback to old school action movies is very refreshing. In a world where pretty much every aging star tries to reinvent himself to stay relevant, Stallone really seems to make a statement by staying exactly the same. Sure, by now his genre is pretty much dead and buried because of newer, smarter and more modern action flicks, but one can hardly deny ""The Expendables"" is still incredibly entertaining. The movie almost feels like a really long trailer, it's pretty much nothing but explosions, cheesy one-liners and tough guys being tough and acting as wooden as humanly possible. The movie's mainly a homage to this kind of shoot-em-up flicks, and you can tell these makers are really fond of what they're doing. Occasionally the tongue-in-cheek feel is a bit overdone (the cameos by Ah-nuld and Bruce Willis seem stilted and pointless), but overall this touch is very welcome. The ridiculously (and I mean ridiculously) happy ending is just icing on the cake. It takes some very clever people to make something this dumb."
"guitarhero136","2","3","7","18 December 2010"," Hilariously Awful
","I came into this movie with high expectations, but I feel confident that even if I had no expectations at all, I would somehow have been disappointed. It was downhill form the start, and at first I thought it was a joke. Honestly, the special effects were so bad, even in the opening scene (purple thermal camera, lasers on sniper rifles, don't get me started on the blood), that it looked like it had been made as a spoof. With such a big name cast, I was obviously expecting much more. In fairness to the actors, they did okay with the lines they were given, and Mickey Rourke was a definite bright spot, but the dialogue was awful, and none of the one-liners were witty. Additionally, the claim that Schwarzenegger and Willis are in this movie is completely deceitful, as they are only in the movie for a total of two minutes, in a completely actionless and uninteresting scene. I'm going to skip over the plot holes because I do realize what kind of movie this is, which almost requires plot holes, but the overall story was not very compelling. The whole back story of Christmas I found to be irrelevant and distracting to the plot (a term which I use loosely). I did not grow to like any of the characters. There was a meth-head that somehow is impervious to bullets to the chest, a constantly complaining Asian stereotype, a whiny and stupid General's daughter, Sylvester Stalone, a guy named ""Toll Road,"" who is hardly noticeable until he takes down Austin, the Old Spice guy, and the requisite knife-thrower who seemed be devoid of three-dimensionality of any sort, despite the writers' best attempts to throw in a beaten girlfriend. In conclusion; the effects suck, the characters suck more, the plot sucks even more, and the action is unsatisfying, particularly with the terrible ever-shaking camera (it adds suspense) and awful camera angles."
"clydsterama","2","3","7","13 December 2010"," Used Action guys get used up
","It's not just that the story and acting are ludicrous, even the action is. Why does Jason Statham have to get into the front of that plane? Maybe it's a P-38 -- I don't know -- but it's ridiculous in this day and age. If Sylvester had done something with guys who rebuff hi-tech and go with their mitts it'd be acceptable. Now it's just silly. <br/><br/>And what about that fight with the basketballers, one of whom was bonking Charisma...? Is that the way you wanted the fight meted out to these thugs? They wait for one another to get beaten before another dives in at Statham. And the action in La Vinena (hahaha) or made-up -place-goes here, didn't start until we were 33 minutes in. It's incoherent until then.<br/><br/>This thing was a scrambled mess, unsavable in the cutting room. Too bad... I like all these guys when they're on their own and the material is good."

","Now, I went into this movie, hoping to get a throwback to old Arnold movies like Commando and Predator. Okay, if that's what you're hoping for, you will be disappointed. The Expendables is about a group of steroid-pumping tough guy mercenaries led by Sylvester Stallone, who plays a character named Barney. Honestly, I am not intimidated by a guy named Barney. Nor am I intimidated by his Dave Navarro-esquire facial hair, or his leather skin, which resulted from too much time under a tanning bed. In addition to the characters not being intimidating, the story tries to take a movie that had a fun, trashy concept and tries to cram too much story into it. I don't care about the Melodrama behind Jason Stathom's character, Lee Christmas (that is his real name). The climax would have saved the movie, had it not been ENTIRELY CGI. Blood, explosions, people, everything was added in. Any throwback attempt would be completely wasted, because of CGI. The Expendables has a fun concept, unoriginal but it had potential, but it disappoints..."

","Movie brilliance is measured by the amount of fun you have when you see it. Film brilliance is determined through cinematography, story, direction, acting, and message. Sylvester Stallone has managed to grasp, in his direction, the fun feel of his 80's & 90's cheese ball movies (Cobra, Over The Top, Rocky 3, Demolition Man, Judge Dredd) and mixed them in with over the top acting and a fairly decent storyline. Stallone has shown to be a matured director is his day, beginning from ""Rocky Balboa"" and ""Rambo"" which were very underrated films in my humble opinion, he brings us to ""The Expendables."" Expendables glorifies the lives of mercenaries for hire and shows us how you can lose your mind in blood-lust. Although it is full of gritty action scenes, decapitations, limbs lost, and brilliant martial arts the story is very desirable. Stallone and his cronies are hired to go into a hot military zone and silence an American defector who is selling weapons to the enemy. Along the course of the mission, Stallone's character falls for a woman and his decisions become based on her safety opposed to that of his team. The movie is very brilliantly shot against darkness and all of the fight scenes are story driven. The ending offers more than a few surprises and the supporting cast is brilliant. Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Jason Statham, Randy Couture, Mickey Rourke, Steve Austin, Eric Roberts, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Wills are all amazing in their respective parts, with Statham's support as the most front-loaded towards Stallone's story. If you are going to catch and action film, this is the one you do not want to miss."

Ross and company have just finished a mission and fired one of their own for conduct unbecoming The Man Gunner Jenson wonderfully played by Dolph Lundgren has become too messed up he's stoned or as Lee Christmas Ross's Right hand man says the life got to him.

Suddenly everything goes wrong and Ross And Christmas must battle their way out of there when Sandra is captured. The Expendables also find out the truth they were offered a contract to take out a rogue CIA agent named Jack Monroe played with great effect by Eric Roberts. Monroe and the General have turned the island into their own drug production factory the CIA can t have the embarrassment of one of their own turning rogue and becoming a drug kingpin so they hired them to kill him. But Ross turns it down he does not want to get involved with the CIA again. But he can't get Sandra off of his mind and the nobility she displayed so in a effort to save what's left of his soul the Expendables return to the island. But not before a fantastic battle occurs between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren in one of the best filmed action scenes of the movie. The Film 's climatic ending left me cheering and I also felt Stallone has grown as a writer and a director. He gives us a scene that 20 years ago would not have been filmed in which Ross meets Monroe's Hench man Paine played with bad intentions by Steve Austin Paine beats him in a fight and when Christmas asks him what he's doing Ross replies Getting my ass kicked. Something Stallone would've never done 20 years ago back then he had to win every fight now he's allowing others that right in his movies. the Expendables is not the greatest film ever made nor is it the worst but to a real action fan it's pure gold."

Worth viewing once for the nostalgia and to see action stars trying to hold back the years, but personally it won't be added to my collection of films until it appears in the bargain bucket.

","And I enjoyed it for what it was. Almost any film good ole Sly Stallone is in is gonna be a beat-em-up, blow-em-up, shoot-em-up festival of bad-assness. Add in all the other action-adventure badasses of the last 25 or so years and just multiply the ""beat, shoot and blow"" factor. There wasn't anything that needed any overly serious thought in this film; just let it happen! Was it a *great* film? No. Was it a seriously horrible film? NO!! It was exactly what Stallone and the rest of the guys involved wanted it to be: a rousing, exciting and fun blow-out with a lot of familiar faces. Even now-Cali Governor Schwarzenegger makes a small appearance (not news, I know). My favorite a$$-kick sequence was the basketball court. My favorite exchange was ""What happened to you?"" ""I got my a$$ kicked!""<br/><br/>78/100 on the ablebravo scorecard."
"MaxBorg89","7","3","7","19 September 2010"," Long live the '80s!
","It is a well known fact that some big summer movies base their commercial appeal on whoever is playing the leading role. often emphasizing the star rather than the story. This is particularly true with The Expendables, an action movie where the plot is almost secondary to the cast list: Sylvester Stallone (who also co-wrote and directed the film), Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis, even Arnold Schwarzenegger (distracted from his Governor duties for a few hours to make a cameo appearance).<br/><br/>However, every movie needs a narrative to propel the action, so here's what The Expendables is all about: Barney Ross (Stallone) is the leader of the eponymous mercenary team, which comprises Li, Statham, Lundgren and Terry Crews, among others (Rourke is also involved, though in a more indirect way). Each team member has a specific skill, best employed in a series of dangerous, clandestine missions. One of them involves assassinating a South American dictator (David Zayas of Dexter fame) and his US ally (a rogue CIA operative played by Eric Roberts), who run a fictitious island with predictably cruel methods.<br/><br/>This being a by-numbers action flick, albeit more violent than, say, The A-Team (however, the bloodletting is more amusing than shocking, thanks to Stallone's Tarantino-like approach), a ridiculously simple premise was to be expected. The downside is that Sly has clearly spent more time on casting than on structuring the film, meaning that individual scenes, deliberately written to suit the actors (and some roles were recast two or three times, requiring an equal number of rewrites), are the very definition of fun, whereas the movie as a whole suffers whenever the plot has to progress. Additionally, not everyone receives the same treatment: Crews and Andy Couture, for example, are stranded with quite irrelevant characters, perhaps due to their background not being related to acting, while the female players (Charisma Carpenter being one) are just wallpaper.<br/><br/>That said, when Stallone gets it right, The Expendables really soars above expectations, as his cast of '80s ""washouts"" (and new action poster-boy Statham) pay tribute to the genre's most glorious decade with genuine relish. In fact, the film's best moments are the ones where the stars make fun of themselves: whether it's Li and Lundgren arguing over who would win in a fistfight, Stallone and Statham debating the merits of old versus new or the former Rambo teaming up with Willis and Schwarzenegger (who makes his entrance à la Terminator) for the most geek-friendly scene of the year, everyone knows they're not supposed to take any of it seriously, and that makes for a better film.<br/><br/>Overall, The Expendables is something of a mixed bag: not really the sum of its parts, but entertaining enough to justify a sequel which, according to early reports and fan-boy wishes, will try to make room for Jean-Claude van Damme and Chuck Norris. Now, how's that for hype?"

Psychological drama? Comedy?<br/><br/>It meant to be brainless/plot less action and brainless/plot less action it IS!<br/><br/>It meant to has at least one crazy streetrace in it. It has.

As many action movies that I have seen, hell, for all that we have seen, we have wanted to see them all share the screen and get pumped for the smack down that would ensue.<br/><br/>That time has arrived.<br/><br/>We have them all. Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, Terry Crews.<br/><br/>All from the early 80's to now, age does not mean anything. Sure, character development is difficult in a movie with this big cast, but I believe the development was well done. Most was given to Statham, Rourke, and Lundgren, yes you head me Van Damme, Lundgren. Lundgren's character made perfect sense. Dolph showed he still has some excellent acting and action chops as he played his character with conviction. There is even a remarkable scene with Rourke talking about a dark time. This was one really excellent scene.<br/><br/>Of course there is the action, what this was made for. Everyone here gets in on it. We get the fights to the guns to the explosives and to the countless number of dead bad guys. I laughed and roared at the extreme scenes of violence and you can't go wrong with the last added ingredient of awesomeness, Eric Roberts.<br/><br/>And the best thing about this? No politics. NONE. YEAH!!!! This is action and some fine acting as well. Stallone is not sending a political message, he is sending message of this: age is just a number.<br/><br/>This is what I expected and delivered ten fold. Thank you Stallone!"

I can only think that these reviews and comments were written by people who walked in off the street to see this. For the fans, the people who have been waiting for this from the moment the project was announced, you will not be disappointed!<br/><br/>There is minimal plot, minimal character development, minimal emotion. If thats what you want out of a film, this isn't for you. What there is is fist fights, gun fights, knife fights, explosions, violence and gore in abundance. Quite literally some of the finest action scenes ever committed to film. I watched it with my mouth open! Although a sequel is rumoured, its hard to imagine how it could be bettered.<br/><br/>To sum it up simply, think Commando + Rambo on steroids and you might come somewhere close. Action fans, Stallone fans, Statham fans, Li fans- go and see this film, it may be the best one you ever see.

Sly used mostly first half hour of movie in trailer and has hidden the best part to be seen.<br/><br/>The movie is funny sometimes and has its story, too. But basically is like one of best 80s movies.

Jet Li's still got the jets, Jason Statham's hot anyway and I was a bit disappointed his shirt stayed on, but Dolph Lundgren was the kicker for me. I still love Universal Soldier and it's great to see him back in action.<br/><br/>Critics will say this movie is for nostalgic movie goers but they wouldn't know a good entertaining flick if it bit them in the a**.

","I love Sylvester Stallone so much and I like all of his movies. He is a legend to me. However, this movie was bad. The movie is screaming: ""I am made for Stallone"". The director, the writer and the main character is Sylvester Stallone. Even the other actors they scream too: ""we are here for Stallone!"". This will be accepted if Stallone is good at all of them, but he is only good as an actor. he is a miracle action movie actor. The director part of the movie was bad. The acting was not realistic. The story is good but so simple and straight forward. The only thing that is good in the movie is the action seen. However, in some of those actions seen, Stallone does unrealistic moves and appears so old and exhausted. If you like me love Stallone, please do not watch this movie.

","The subtitling of a Somali pirate's English in the opening scenes of The Expendables is understandable, it's just a pity that they didn't keep the subtitles going for the other 100 minutes, because a substantial portion of the grunting and growling that passes for dialogue is unintelligible. This would be a problem if anything that was being said was important or required for understanding of the plot, but it isn't, because the plot is a straight line from A to B, entirely one dimensional, so you can fill in the gaps yourself, if you even notice them. On the subject of sound, it is even more uneven than your standard Hollywood blockbuster, but you are not missing much by dialling things down to save your eardrums during the action sequences. There's an amiable buddy-buddy bonhomie running through the script that is enjoyable, and the action well done, and includes the best water plane escape scene since Raiders of the Lost Ark, but overall The Expendables is clichéd and predictable. That's all very well, regrettable, but not objectionable, and it seems clear that this was the film's low-set aspiration anyway, however when you are literally falling asleep during the 'climactic' assault on the evil general's headquarters, I think you can safely say that the film's value as mindless entertainment, it's only real selling point, is limited."
"tendobear","4","2","4","21 January 2013"," Expendable
","Hmmm...with all the action movie stars ever starring in an action movie you'd expect something special, but you'd be wrong. The Expendables is as loud, dumb and flashy as you'd expect, but it's just no fun. Surprisingly, there's not much action in it neither, well, not nearly as much as I expected. The fight scenes were pretty lousy too; you couldn't see what anybody was doing and when you could see they were pretty unspectacular and uninspired. I was really looking forward to seeing one of my favourite Mixed-Martial Artists - Randy Couture - in hand-to-hand combat, but he hardly fought, in fact he was hardly in the movie. For a movie that boasts all the action stars ever, shouldn't we be going from set-piece to set- piece that showcases the things that we made us love these action stars in the first place? All in all, I never expected Oscar-worthy material, but for an action movie and given the action talent on hand it was really unoriginal, uninspired and just plain boring. But still, at least it's better than Prometheus!"
"Hawkensian","6","2","4","9 August 2012"," A surprisingly entertaining film that ignores credibility with delightfully wanton results.
","All realism and credibility is thrown out of the window in this delightfully macho celebration of the 1980s action film. The action scenes are huge, loud and fantastically violent. It blends brutally choreographed mêlée, explosions and gunfights, with each one of the Expendables having their fair share of the action. However, although the film is satiatingly steeped in aestheticised violence, I did find that some of the CGI violence wasn't as tangible as I'd have liked, I prefer old fashioned squibs and syrup. This is unfortunately a problem in many modern films, even in the incredibly violent 'Rambo' (2008).<br/><br/>The plot is a simple, familiar one; it follows the Expendables as they infiltrate and overthrow a Latin American dictator, with the token sinister executive thrown in there for good measure. Away from all the wanton destruction are parts that are surprisingly character driven, particularly the chemistry between Stallone and Statham, whose tough, competitive camaraderie may be somewhat clichéd but certainly entertaining.<br/><br/>As the image above suggests, a terrific cast has been assembled, it includes: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Mickey Rourke, Randy Couture, Steve Austin and even cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. There are some notable names missing from the cast, but thankfully there's scope for a whole Expendables franchise, giving many other fan favourites an opportunity to become an Expendable. This is probably the first time that I've found myself wanting a mindless blockbuster franchise to come to fruition; with a team of cine-literate, witty writers, the possibilities are almost endless for potential sequels. Who knows, the film could even attract some heavyweight talent in the form of Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino - 'The Expendables' could add further dimensions to its celebration of masculinity!<br/><br/>Perhaps my satisfaction with the film was accentuated by my low expectations coming into it, but I think I would've enjoyed it regardless of expectation; it delivered the masculine, ridiculously excessive carnage that, for me, makes it a funny, exciting break from reality - I left the film with a big smile on my face.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"
"jd-songshu","Null","2","4","26 September 2011"," What do you get when you put together several of top action stars and you give them 5-10 minutes each to shine...
","As far as action - it has action, but very little character development and no contrast. Each one of these actors could've been enough to fill a movie but if you start adding them together into 103 minute action flick - it's way too compressed to utilize any of them.<br/><br/>It was awesome to see interaction between many of them - more so the body language than the dialogue, but I think the formula doesn't work as far as far as expectations. A lot of people will have their favourites so they will say ""it's movie with Arnold and Bruce Willis"", some will say ""It's Jason kicking a**"".. But it's really about neither - none of these characters get enough screen time to show their most modern ""self"" on screen. So some people love the on screen characters but see very little of them and go ""what just happened?""<br/><br/>It reminds me of ""Executive Decision"" - a movie with Steven Seagall without Steven Seagall. He gets sucked out few minutes in literally. ROFL<br/><br/>In contrast to a B-movie where you might see almost no characters you might recognize and have low expectations - it might work out for the better overall than building the hype with names only to see that there is no space to fit them.<br/><br/>This movie is similar to taking a standard size pizza and stuffing 2 lbs of pepperoni on top because ""pepperoni is good and adds taste"". You take 103 minutes of a movie and you stuff it with so many action stars that it starts to resemble naked gun with cameo performances.<br/><br/>Good idea but it might have worked better in the rocky style of sequels but line up maybe 2-3 action stars per movie at a time and develop those, send them off on vacation or kill them off and keep going..<br/><br/>Again, great idea to bring all these guys together - I think Stallone is awesome for doing this, but he could've done this with an interview get together as well and done a good action flick too.<br/><br/>Either way - fun to watch :)"

","When i first heard of this movie, was at comic con. At the time ill admit, i didn't think much of it. i knew sylvester is a fantastic actor and director, but i didn't imagine this movie being the best or greatest. as it turns out, it exceeded my expectations. the cast of the team is in my opinion a very nice bunch. I really enjoyed watching the likes of, Sylvester, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, and Terry Crews. Everyone else, ill be honest, i didn't know till the movie. I really loved the small cameos Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. i actually counted, Arnold only came out for two minutes, and Bruce three. they gave bruce an extra mintue. Mickey Rourke was also a fantastic addition to the movie, my only regret is that i wanted to see him in action. Seeing his great movies like the wrestler, and Iron man 2, i was really wanting to see more of him in this kind of movie. Still overall, this movie delivers, the action is every, they do fill in small spaces for the storyline, which in my opinion, was not needed. I could have walked in their and seen just the action and still enjoyed the small chats in between and slap jokes. Still, i guess it gave the characters a bit of definition. i think the only one who really got to have that was Jason though, everyone else was mostly secondary. In any case, the reason i give this movie a 9 overall is because, it was not perfect. im hoping in the sequel they will add more actors, less wrestlers. I honestly think its rare when they make good actors. they are great for the action scenes, but when you try to give them humanity, it does not really work out in these kind of movies. But its a great movie to watch, i personally can watch it a bunch of times and not get tired of it. So if your a fan of sylvester, this delivers. if you just like plain action movies, it delivers. If you want a movie with a good story, your better off looking elsewhere."

This film full of action and adventure is like a tribute to all those 80's and 90's action movies, first because all the representatives of those movies appear here (Bruce Willis, Sylsvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger). The story is predictable and the plot is a little weak. The cast is interesting, formed by actors (Stallone, Li, Statham, Lundgren, Rourke) and wrestlers (Austin and Couture) everyone doing the best they can and with the special appearances of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger parodying themselves the movie is quite enjoyable.

When I finally saw the film what I got was a film that was more action driven then plot driven, the pace was rather fast, it quickly sets up the plot, it keeps the character development simple and you don't need to put on you're thinking cap because the plot doesn't even try to be complex, it sets out to be a straight ahead all out action movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes are insane to put it simple, they're all fast paced and really violent and just what the doctor would prescribe to any action fan.<br/><br/>Overall, as an action film it doesn't disappoint, viewed as something else it obviously will and of course this is the third time that Jason Statham and Jet Li appeared in a film together, they previously appeared together in THE ONE and WAR, and this is the second film that Steve Austin and Terry Crews have appeared in together, they previously appeared together in THE LONGEST YARD and here's one that's not in the trivia section, this is the second film that DOLPH LUNDGREN and GARY DANIELS have appeared in together, they previously appeared together in a Sci-Fi movie called RETROGRADE."
"airguitar57","6","2","4","8 September 2010"," Action dripping with nostalgia
","There once was a time when the explosion was king; a time when audiences stormed theaters to see fistfights and car chases. During this era of shrapnel and black eyes, three men stood atop Olympus and ruled with clenched fists. The cinematically omnipotent trifecta of Schwarzenegger, Willis and Stallone were all that was the summer blockbuster. With The Expendables, we return to this period of pure testosterone. Oh the 80s, how we've missed you.<br/><br/>The Expendables are a team of mercenaries. Led by Barney Ross the team takes on jobs that others just can't handle. The team's mission coordinator, Tool, is informed of two new missions for the group, one a ""walk in the park"" and the other ""to hell and back""; three guesses which mission they sign on for. The mission involves traveling to Vilena, an island in the Gulf of Mexico, and overthrowing General Garza, an evil dictator. After meeting their contact, Sandra, and assessing the situation Ross decides that it is too complicated for his team. However, after failing to convince Sandra to leave with him Ross is faced with a difficult decision. Does he listen to his research or go with his gut? Again, three guesses.<br/><br/>I have been excited for this film ever since I heard that Stallone was thinking about it. As a 12-year-old, I believed that Rocky Balboa brought unity between the Soviet Union and the United States in his defeat of Ivan Drago. The first Spanish that I knew was followed by the word ""baby"". Hell, I even saw Over the Top. In short, although I may be a child of the 90s I have a deep love of the action films of 80s. Now I saw Grindhouse and enjoyed every minute of it, but the concept was lost on me. I didn't grow up seeing double features, I grew up with action excess. A film that is an homage to the golden age of action films was what I wanted. However, herein lies the problem. Die Hard and Rocky IV are products of that long lost time, and remain deeply rooted in that. To redo those films now would be akin to a 40-year-old that tries way too hard to adhere to the modern day ""cool"". No Richard, that is not fresh.<br/><br/>Let us first attack the writing, the god-awful writing. Some would give Stallone a by but I say nay. We know that Stallone is capable of writing some damn good films, even the most recent Rocky Balboa was written well, so I don't know if he tried to write terrible dialogue or if he got drunk to pound it out. As for the other writer, Dave Callaham, whoever you are, please put away your pen. I'm not even going to fault the film for its formulaic and predictable story since its 80s brethren often succumb to this same pit of despair; the problem is the dialogue. Seriously, no one talks like these guys, ever, and the final scene, which sees Jason Statham engaging in poetry that is sickenly awful, is a terrible note to leave on. Then there are the character names. Lee Christmas, Ying Yang, Hale Caesar and Toll Road. The shear act of recounting them is upsetting. I doubt that any cast could have pulled off this dialogue, but that of course brings us to the next problem, the acting.<br/><br/>I hesitate to refer to what goes on in the film as acting, in some cases it is little more than script reading. Randy Couture as the aforementioned Toll Road is absolutely terrible, and I have no problem saying that since I am confident he will never read this. Mr. Couture, you are a great fighter, but there is no Oscar gold in your future. His acting is so terrible that scenes are made worse by every line he delivers. The other members of the cast just barely scrape by as they utter the words that were crapped into the screenplay. Nevertheless, one scene exists as a diamond in the rough. Mickey Rourke injects a short scene in which he recounts his time on the job with such emotion and authenticity that I was shocked to see it in this film.<br/><br/>Do not get the wrong impression; The Expendables is completely worth the price of admission. The film is an action film through and through and my disappointments with it come from a place of heightened expectations. A scene featuring the trio of action deities is delivered with tongue firmly in cheek and will satisfy any fan. The two standouts of the entire film are Dolph Lundgren and Terry Crews. Lundgren knows exactly what he signed up for and is both intimidating and funny. As for Terry Crews, the guy has very little screen time but manages to be one of the best parts of the final action set piece. Then of course, there is the action. Despite an overuse of CGI blood, which does nothing but hurt a film, the action is fantastic. The final set piece, which lasts for at least half an hour, easily increased my rating of the film by half a letter grade.<br/><br/>My expectations of The Expendables were admittedly too high. I went in hoping to see one of the best action films of all time and left underwhelmed. The writing is the film's Achilles' heel. There is little to no character development and dialogue that is unspeakable. Some of the acting especially that of former wrestlers and current fighters is distractingly awful. Nevertheless, the action does not disappoint. The film features action set pieces that are over-the-type and completely awesome. I often had to fight the urge to stand up and cheer during every explosion. The film will not be remembered as a cinematic masterpiece but more likely as the film that brought together Schwarzenegger, Willis and Stallone. The Expendables has some glaring faults but it is complete testosterone entertainment."

Scattered in there is some humor, sometimes dry, sometimes subtle, to make some light moments. There are a few hot babes but no skin or sex and very little vulgarity.

","I sat down, ready to watch a fun and simple action flick. I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The main draw to this film is obviously the cast. There is meant to be a novelty in watching all of these legendary action heroes team up on screen. However, I never really felt like the film pulled this off. For starters, some actors have very little screen time, including Rourke and Willis. Other actors also were very sidelined, and I never felt like the team dynamic was really there. I wasn't convinced at all that the characters had been friends for years, despite the film's pretense of such.<br/><br/>In general, the movie is incredibly cliched, without actually being entertaining. The mission, the heroes, the villains, the romance, all of it. It's very empty.<br/><br/>The action is fine, I guess. It's there. There are some cool shots and moments, but it mostly isn't filmed or edited very well, and just sort of washes over you.<br/><br/>Overall, disappointingly forgettable."

","This is the OG <a href=""/title/tt0848228/"">The Avengers (2012)</a>. Marvel can suck it.<br/><br/>This movie gets way too much hate. I guess it's hard to appreciate a great creative vision. This is an action movie, for action movie fans.<br/><br/>Of course the cast is gonna be great. Sly Stallone is as good as ever, and still a charismatic leading man even if he's obviously older. Jet Li and Jason Statham were great inclusions, and both demonstrate some of their better acting abilities, as well as their martial arts. Dolph Lundgren is great too, playing himself, as you'd expect. In fact, everyone in this movie are playing themselves. Randy Couture wasn't given a ton of screen time, but had some great moments, including a great fight with Steve Austin, who was the perfect henchman. Terry Crews also should've been given more screen time, but he's great. Arnold and Bruce Willis are here in one smile-inducing scene, and both make you happy watching them together. Probably the strangest cast member here is Mickey Rourke, who is an action star, sure, but he doesn't participate in any of the action. Instead, he's given a great monologue where he actually acts well.<br/><br/>Sly's direction is good, and while there were some fast cuts at times, most of the action is visible and visceral. He of course knows how to action scenes, which makes sense since he's one of the biggest action stars ever.<br/><br/>The story is alright, typical action flick stuff, but who is here for story. We're here for the action, which I thought was stupidly fun. The opening boat scene, that fight with Sly, Statham, and a bunch of bad guys by a truck, the plane/docks scene, the car chase and garage fight scene, the basketball court fight scene, and the massive final battle. The final sequence is very flashy and entertaining, and there are also a lot of great fight scenes. Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren fight each other twice, Sly fights Steve Austin, Li and Statham fight Gary Daniels, and Randy Couture fights Steve Austin. The violence is brutal and bloody, and suitably vicious for this kind of movie.<br/><br/>I can proudly recommend this to action fans, especially fans of the actors. It's full of action, gritty violence, good one-liners, and nostalgia."

The Expendables brought together some legends with himself Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Mickey Rouke & some other greats such as Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, Gary Daniels & Eric Roberts. That's an impressive cast of Action stars & Stallone delivered an Action packed brutal Thriller made in the mould of the 80's & 90's Action style, the blood flows as explosions & bullets fly accross the screen in an Action frenzy, it's such a fun movie & feels Nostalgic because of it's look, feel & actors!!!<br/><br/>Stallone & Statham make a great duo & have such fun chemistry & banter, the basic simple action story is the wild bunch of mercenaries known as the ""Expendables"" are on a mission to stop an evil latin American dictator & a corrupt ex- CIA agent (Roberts) & what unfolds is non-stop brutal & bloody old school action with plenty of Manley gritty moments & Awesome fight scenes & brutal shootouts & Stallone is excellent as the leader of his rag tag team ""Barney Ross"" so if you grew up on the old Action stuff like i did from way back on video, then you will love this!!!
Great little cameos from Schwarzenegger & Bruce Willis too.
Jason Statham probably is the best here & steals the show but it's great to see all my childhood heroes back & together, it's an Action resurrection & a blast of Nostalgia but in a new time for movies!!!

","Writer David Callaham submitted the first draft of an action film called Barrow to Warner Brothers, revising it several times until it caught the attention of Sylvester Stallone, who used it as a starting point for this ensemble film. Or maybe not - as Nu Image and Millennium Films filed a lawsuit against Callaham and the Writers Guild of America West in 2013 for ""fraud, unjust enrichment and declaratory relief over a flawed and misinformed Guild arbitration that gave Callaham undeserved writing credit"" for The Expendables series of films.<br/><br/>Regardless, he's gone on to great success, writing films like Doom, Horsemen, 2014's Godzilla, Ant-Man and the upcoming Zombieland: Double Tap, Wonder Woman 1984 and Marvel's Shang-Chi. And The Expendables films have become big money makers. Hollywood is crazy sometimes, right?<br/><br/>The Expendables are an elite group of mercs who are made up of some of the biggest action stars of the last few decades. Led by Barney Ross (Stallone), they are bladed weapons expert Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), hand-to-hand fighter Yin Yang (Jet Li), one-time mathematics genius and now burned out combat vet Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), weapons specialist Hale Caesar (originally this role was for Wesley Snipes, but it ended up going to Terry Crews) and demolitions expert Toll Road (MMA fighter Randy Couture).<br/><br/>The thrill of this movie is seeing who shows up next, like Mickey Rourke as Tool, the team's friends, as well as Barney's rival Trench Mauser (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and CIA boss Mr. Church (Bruce Willis). The mission in this film involves overthrowing a corrupt general who has an army of his own mercs led by Dan Paine (""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin) and support from his own ex-CIA agent James Munroe (Eric Roberts).<br/><br/>This is also all about men coming to grips with their feelings, like the overly angry Jensen leaving the team and having to win them back to his side, Christmas losing his girlfriend (Charisma Carpenter) and winning her back, the toll of combat on a man and Barney trying to deal with the losses he's had to endure as the leader of the team. But it's also about fistfights and things blowing up real good.<br/><br/>Stallone went through hell making this film, suffering fourteen injuries like breaking a tooth, rupturing his ankle and a hairline fracture in his neck that required the surgical insertion of a metal plate. He also had bronchitis and shingles to top it all off. He also found the time to direct the film despite the multitude of injuries he was going through.<br/><br/>The Expendables was a movie that Hollywood may have thought no one was looking for, but action fans were crazing the kind of movie that has a body count of 188. It succeeded at the box office, making $275 million worldwide on an $80 million dollar budget. Of course, sequels would soon be in the offering and the ensemble cast would be greatly expanded. In my opinion, they could make one of these movies every single weekend and I'd show up for them."

They've got all the people you've come to love, some new people you didn't know you loved yet, just trying to save the world or end it. Leave it to Sylvester Stallone to know that for every life-changing Oscar nomination out there, sometimes people need to just watch things blow up. This works really well for an action-packed ensemble movie and in no way should be a recipe for how to run a government.<br/><br/>So, watch this if you want some deep 80's action meta and you want Arnold to admit he'd make a great Presinator of this great United States."

Okay, they're missing a few, but that's still quite a lot of literal man power in one cast. And with two sequels, they've added a few more to the cast with each installment.<br/><br/>There's really no way to go wrong with a movie like this. No matter who your favorite action star is, he's guaranteed nearly equal screen time as the others and he's guaranteed an impressive action scene or two. If you like wrestling, shooting, street fighting, or martial arts, you'll be a happy camper. No matter your age, if you're a teenager and like to see guys who are the same age as your dad beating people up, if you remember going to see these actors in the movie theaters, or if you've always referred to them as ""those new young stars"", you'll enjoy seeing them age with grace, dexterity, and pizazz."

You have to turn your brain off and just watch the explosions and fights, otherwise you spend an hour and a half asking, ""Why did the do that? Why are they helping him? What is their relationship, Is that really how that works? Why are they there?"" The plot is nonsense and the violence and explosions are too underwhelming to make up for it. The acting ranges from almost good (Couture and Statham) to terrible (Stallone and Giselle Itie). It's the equivalent of a porno; you're really just watching for the action scenes and everything else is just filler. A 15 minute super-cut of the explosions and violence would be easier to watch. The only true highlight is seeing Randy Couture wear stupid hats. Unless you really like one of the main characters (not Rourke or Willis even though they are on all the posters) or explosions and couldn't care less about the story, I can't see how it's worth your time."

","27 August 2010. This above decent action thriller begins with substance but eventually collapses on itself into chaos. This is no Jason Bourne from Bourne Identity multiplied by three or four. The beginning scene was too dark and confusing to really have the sharp, dazzling impact it could have had, the car chase also was confusing, the near escape of the antagonist twice as a bit too staged, especially the second time as things start blowing up. The big explosion scene was also mis-managed as instead of the having many more police force inside the building they were outside which in same ways resulted in a really messy climactic explosive battle with so many scenes that were just edited bits of bullets flying, heads exploding...Another let down was Jet Li's big martial arts scene which seemed only to result in the smaller being battered and that only in the end bullets count more.<br/><br/>Mickey Rouke, continued to play his new more rough and tumbled role from his Oscar nominated performance of The Wrestler (2008) though it would have been nice to see a different side of his persona and extend his acting range. Nevertheless, there was a decent effort in incorporate an emotional connection into this movie, including Charisma Carpenter's (from Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) girlfriend role which still didn't have enough screen time and an attempt at a more balanced presentation of bad guys. Unfortunately, the end result was more blood and guts, grinding meat of mercenary fame instead of the more stylish martial arts and mental and physical prowess."

But this somewhat narcissistic exploit actually missed the point of the pictures it was trying to recapture and, while its intentions may have been somewhat pure and only motivated monetarily by a majority fraction instead of a whole one, this means that it fails in its mission to take action flicks back to their 'glory days' despite the fact that much lead is slung and many Stallone one-liners are slurred, though the blood-packs are entirely replaced with their digital equivalents - and their non-convincing digital equivalents at that. 'The Expendables (2010)' ends up a rather dull slog through cliché after cliché, trope after trope and, perhaps less often than you'd like or even expect, shoot-out after shoot-out but avoids the fun that comes with even the 'worst' of the genre without having the courtesy to being self-aware about it.

Presumably this is not so with Mr Stallone's Barney Ross(named after the boxer - biopic ""Monkey on my back""?) .
Although to be fair to him ,in the opening scene he displays the patience of a saint in dealing with a psycho pirate.

Wearing only jeans and a tee shirt Mr Statham finds an endless supply of throwing knives which hit their target unerringly during their first encounter with the enemy.
Biggles thought knives were the province of the slightly shady ""foreigner"" and,to the best of my knowledge of the canon never resorted to their use.

","Rule number one, never promise a concept that is then not delivered. Expectations are created and inevitably are crushed by the realisation that the film you wanted is not what is shown. I love me a good action blockbuster, even the cheesy 80s low budget messes. Yet, somehow, this was mediocre. A team of mercenaries take on a private mission to eliminate a dictator so that the island's resources can be obtained. Blah blah blah who cares, the script writers certainly didn't. It's a generic plot about drugs and money that functions as a means of showcasing the action that we all want to see. Unfortunately, these action scenes are far and few between thus providing a sluggish pace that is riddled with cumbersome dialogue. It's not even quotable dialogue like in action classics that this film attempted to gain inspiration from. Schwarzenegger still remains the ultimate quotable machine, but his cameo appearance wasn't enough. The chemistry between Statham and Stallone works and didn't feel too forced. A well executed microcosm to distinguish the combination of veteran action stars with the modern newbies. Perhaps too much focus on these two, I would've liked to have seen the other members have standout moments. The sarcastic banter between the characters allowed them to work as a unit. Think of them as a working family powered by guns, blades and muscles. All cast members gave committed performances that oozed masculinity, I mean the testosterone levels were insane. The action scenes were mostly well shot with perhaps too many quick cuts, although the green screen for some segments was rather apparent. A scene involving Statham decimating a group of guys at a basketball court was a highlight and conveys his dedication to the stunt work. On the one hand, The Expendables works as a generic mindless action flick. However on the other hand, it fails to consistently captivate due to a clunky script and inconsistent pacing. Unremarkable, therefore a misfire in my opinion."

Barney Ross wants to be a white knight, but instead, this film he just comes across as a muscular beta male simp. <br/><br/>Dolph Lundgran's character is absolutely unnecessary and his quarrel with Barney Ross is ludicrous. Jet Li's character is also quite unnecessary and even his action sequences were boring and unimaginative. David Zayas, Eric Roberts and Steve Austin was wasted in this film, as their roles were 1 dimensional and lacked any credibility. <br/><br/>The hand to hand combat was simply tame, slow and weak. it simply showed these guys were too old to do this. <br/><br/>What is good about the film is are the explosions, flight scene, chase scene and the gun fights, which I thought were very well shot and executed. And the script had the occasional great moments, with the banter between Barney Ross and Lee Christmas being the most interesting. <br/><br/>Sigh."

","For the trivia enthusiasts out there : Barney Ross was actually a professional prize fighter in the 1940's who held titles in 3 different classes. 
As for this film : The best way for me to describe it would be like listening to 2 opposing arguments about professional wrestling. One would be that it's mindless and lacking any authenticity. The other would be that it's simply entertainment. Nothing more. Nothing less. 
If you're a fan of this genre, you will probably enjoy this film a great deal. The crew assembled around Barney Ross (Stallone) seems very team-oriented and operate like a well-oiled machine. Eric Roberts turns in a convincing performance as an international villain. What Stallone has managed to do here is expand the tongue-in-cheek action film like he did in Demolition Man. He brings in all sorts of action heroes who actually make fun of their own films in the course of the dialogue. The hand-to-hand combat scenes are incredible and well choreographed. In general, this is an action film not to be taken seriously at all but still viewed closely.
My only regret about the plot itself is that there is no explanation as to how this team gets assembled, what Ross and his teammates did before becoming ""The Expendables"", etc. It simply begins with them venturing out on their first mission. But that's just a minor point. 
Again, if you're a fan of Rambo, Terminator, Die Hard, etc., just sit back, relax and enjoy an action-packed adventure. My personal favorite is Jason Statham as ""Lee Christmas""."

","The Expendables<br/><br/>Let's face it if you grew up in the 80's then you grew up watching these guys. Sly, Arnie, Willis and Lundgren where a staple for the youngsters of that decade. Along with a whole host of other stars, some also featured in this movie. Films such as First blood, The Terminator and Die Hard were big business and the stars of such were superheroes of the time. No tights or cape needed. Just bulging biceps and the well timed one liner. Fast forward on to 2010 when this flick was released and todays youth are fed a diet of Iron man and other marvelicious delicacies. For the grown ups action stars now come with a PHD. Jason Bourne has moved the action genre on forcing even James Bond to step up his game. <br/><br/>The Expendables goes back to old school action. A flick that could have come straight from the 80's. But let's face it, getting Rambo, the Terminator and John McClane on screen together back then would have been impossible. Just think of the budget needed just to pay their salaries. Every young boy in the world would have exploded in their cinema seat with excitement. Probably every boys father too! In 2010 it's a reality and you've got to admire Sylvester Stallones business brain. Rocky sure knows how to make a dollar or two. He's selling us nostalgia and we'll eat it up because nostalgia is good. Take the A Team movie that was released around the same time. It flopped slap bang on its ass because nobody wants to see someone else playing their beloved heroes. We want to actually see our beloved heroes. Can you imagine if Mr T and the original gang returned for that movie if it was possible. Everyone would have flocked to the cinema to see it and I would have pitied the fool that didn't. <br/><br/>Stallone's action mash up reminds us of an era when the cheesy action flick was something you looked forward to. A trip down to the local video store in hope that Rocky 15 didn't have that little red tag on the top of the box that said it was on hire. <br/><br/>The Expendables is a silly film about fictitious good guys beating the snot out of fictitious bad guys in a fictitious country. That's it, plain and simple. No point in analyzing the plot because there barely is one. The negative reviews on here are ridiculous. They are over analyzing something that has been manufactured to wash over you. A product that allows you to take out your brain leave it on the side table and just be entertained. If you analyze the acting, script,plot,direction and every other thing then you've totally missed the point. If this type of movie isn't for you then don't waste your precious time watching it. You know what it's gonna be it says so right there on the tin. As for the rest of us, what's wrong with a little trip down memory lane? A walk down Nostalgia Avenue?"
"Marthian80","4","0","0","4 July 2017"," Takes itself to seriously to pass as an 80's action movie homage
","I saw The Expendables 2 a few years ago and find it an amusing but average (5/10) action movie. I got the chance to see the first one yesterday so I thought 'why not?' and expected it to be better... but that was not the case. <br/><br/>The movie starts with some terrorists on a boat having a bunch of hostages and demanding money. Just when they want to start hurting the hostages, The Expendables show up killing all the terrorists and (miraculously) saving all the hostages. After this opening we meet the Expendable team in person, with the characters Barney Ross(Stallone) and Lee Christmas(Statham) being the main heroes. Stallone receives a new assignment from a man known as Church: assassinate a ruthless dictator of a South American island. Barney and Lee go together to investigate the island and with the help of the attractive rebel leader Sandra they discover the true nature of the conflict. Barney has to make the difficult choice now to just do his job or to follow his heart and help Sandra.<br/><br/>Okay I know this movie is a homage to 80's action movies but the 'story' feels a bit to much like a 1-on-1 copy of Commando and I couldn't care less about the fate of the island people. In this day and age they could do a better job portraying terrorist other then letting some dudes run around with guns and letting them speak in a foreign language. The scenes where they show the 'bad guys' doing 'bad things' where very boring. Also, the acting of the ""rebel leader"" Sandra was horrible and she didn't come over as an leader at all, just a damsel in distress. But yeah, they wanted to go for that 80's action movie feel where everything meaningful is accomplished by big strong men. <br/><br/>There are lot's of big strong man in this movie, alongside Statham and Stallone. They are all standard stereo-type ex-something, exactly like the team from other action movies like Predator for example. The chemistry between the actors is decent and there are some good jokes thrown around. Statham and Stallone together works and the dialogue is not bad. I fail to see beyond the actors though, but I guess that doesn't matter with a movie like this.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment are the action scenes: to much shaky cam and to much quick cuts. There is a car chase in the movie but it is so horrible cut that you cannot follow what exactly is going on at any point. And yeah, I understand that they go for that 80's feel where a couple of guys can wipe out an entire army but they push the boundaries of 'believable action' a bit to far here. (bottomless magazines, the heroes don't get hit when 40 guys fire upon them, huge explosions without any hero getting hurt, etc...) <br/><br/>So for me a disappointing 4 out of 10. It is watchable if your home alone and like to see some mindless action, but I think your better of firing up and old 80's action classic."
"dworldeater","7","0","0","6 April 2017"," The best of the franchise
","The Expendables is an 80's style action movie with an all star cast brought to life by action icon Sly Stallone. Sly was on a roll with excellent sequels to both Rocky and Rambo making a strong comeback to the cinema. Then he made this and rounded up a very good cast of tough guys with Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolf Lundgren,Randy Couture and Terry Crews. The much under rated Eric Roberts is an excellent villain and Steve Austin and Gary Daniels are excellent heavies. Plus cameos from Arnold and Bruce Willis. While this film is in some ways flawed with not too much time to spend on character development and not the best dialouge, I appreciate and enjoy The Expendables regardless. The film looks great and delivers huge on action. Great shootouts, explosions, fighting with fists, knives, feet. It also is very violent and bloody along the lines of the last Rambo film. While not quite as gory or violent as Rambo, the action scenes are bigger and more over the top. The tone of the film is lighter than Rambo and has much in common with the 80's action flicks that this is in the same tradition of. However, this is an ensemble piece and plays like a modern version of The Dirty Dozen. While not as good as The Dirty Dozen, it is a breath of fresh air for me as I am not a fan of most modern action movies that rely on cgi and cast with wimpy actors. The Expendables has a very credible cast of tough actors and brings down the thunder with the firepower and gritty violence much needed in modern cinema. This is not the type of film that critics will praise, but is just what the doctor ordered in an era where the film market does not make films specifically for men anymore, The Expendables are much needed and were a shot in the arm to otherwise lame Hollywood action. Almost a decade has gone by and this holds up pretty well and is much better than the sequels. I did like the second film, but it had too much comedy and was more of an 80's action parody rather than 80's styled action film. The third film was complete garbage and a complete mess and waste of time."

","I guess the only reason I was interested in seeing this was because it was the last (or one of the last) movies to ever be reviewed on Siskel and Ebert or Ebert and Roeper or Roeper or whatever. I really didn't need to know anything about the plot at all, given that it was just a movie about a bunch of action stars getting together and blowing stuff up. That's what I thought I was getting and that's exactly what I got. There actually is a major complaint I have. The most famous star of all was Arnold Schwarzenegger and he barely appears in the film at all! I mean, I thought he'd at least appear at the end to rescue everybody.<br/><br/>That really did annoy me. Even Bruce Willis didn't have much screen time. So, this movie features a bunch of action scenes and killing in all sorts of ways. The action was decent, but there just wasn't anything that good about the characters. It especially got clichéd at the end when they were talking about how the hero and villain were similar and everything. I guess I like the settings. It's just really nothing you haven't seen in many other action movies. I heard Eric Roberts was the most prolific actor out there and it was nice to see him in this movie. **1/2"
"RossRivero99","9","0","0","1 March 2017"," A very entertaining movie with an all-star cast
","Sylvester Stallone's ""The Expendables"" is a good action movie with probably the best ensemble cast for an action movie, and is one of the best action films this decade. The movie focuses on Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team of mercenaries called ""The Expendables"" whose members include Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture), Paine (Steve Austin), and Tool (Mickey Rourke). The team is hired by a man named Mr.Church (Bruce Willis) to kill a dictator who is a fugitive from federal hands and rescue a CIA agent who has been kidnapped. Stallone really knows how to direct a very effective action movie and this is very effective, the action sequences in this movie are expertly choreographed so well that if we were to be one of the bad guys in the movie we would and should be very afraid of a team of action stars like that or as Liam Neeson put it two years earlier in ""Taken"" (2008) ""a special set of skills"". As Roger Ebert once said ""When a movie character is really working we become that character."" Which is exactly how I felt while watching this really fun movie that is one hell of a thrill ride. The one minor problem I had was with Stallone's and Dave Callaham's screenplay because it doesn't really explain the characters very well. But I was also very impressed in this movie with then California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo in this movie in a church talking to Ross and Church about the mission in a foreign country. But in the end this an action movie that totally worked in my opinion."

","I hate to say it because I've been a fan of most of the players here, but the main thing this film did for me was show how old they were all getting to be. Don't take that as a knock, because I'm in my mid-Sixties myself and in good shape, so I can relate to how the Expendables decide to remain relevant in a rapidly changing world. Given the premise, this was bound to be pretty much an over-the-top adrenaline rush for the average fan-boy, but with actors like Willis, Schwarzenegger and Rourke in the cast, one could understandably feel cheated by their in and out appearances in the story. It also didn't surprise me that a lot of the heavy action scenes were filmed almost entirely in the dark, a testament to how impossible it would be for a half dozen guys to take out an army. Which they did as one would expect in a film like this. For me, the best scene was when Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) took out the six dudes on the basketball court. At least that was believable. Yeah right, but considering what he did for a living, maybe he could have pulled it off for real."

Expendables 2 was the best out of the trilogy, starts the action straight away and Expendables 3 was probably the worst out of the three.<br/><br/>The third film seemed more like a casting video, with Stallone travelling around and getting new, younger people for his team. I also found some of the scenes, especially with Mel Gibson, didn't need to be in the movie and wasn't necessary to the storyline including his character buying art and walking up the stairs to his house.<br/><br/>All three films are worth at least a watch once; with #2 being the only one I would watch again."

It's like a bodybuilding convention being held inside Cabela's. <br/><br/>Where it fails is where it should have been more cheesy. We finally get to see Lundgren, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Statham, etc, in a movie together, and it's a bloody lead fest with a toned up love story of attachment when the only attachments should be a foregrip and an ACOG. <br/><br/>Character idiosyncratic combat is great. Statham with knives, Stallone's revolver, Crew's shotgun, Dolph's blade, and Li's fists. Even the hand-to -hand allowed all the characters to bleed their own specific choreography into what felt like a live-action Mortal Kombat meets Commando meets When Mustang Met Sally (er, uh, Harry.) <br/><br/>All in all, a satisfying movie that just left me wanting more of what could have been, should have been, and has-been."

","This movie begins with pirates seizing a ship in the Gulf of Aden and a couple of months later televising their intent to kill one of the hostages due to the failure of the ship's main company to meet their demands. Just prior to actually killing the hostage a small group of mercenaries appear and the leader named ""Barney Ross"" (Sylvester Stallone) throws a bag full of money to the pirates. However, the leader of the pirates now demands more money and a firefight erupts which ends up with the death of all of the pirates along with the release of the hostages. None of the mercenaries are hurt either. Not long afterward the leader of this elite squad of mercenaries is approached by a CIA operative who goes by the name of ""Mr. Church"" (Bruce Willis) and offered an assignment to kill the military leader of a small island in the Gulf of Mexico. After talking briefly with his team Barney and another member by the name of ""Lee Christmas"" (Jason Statham) decide to go to the island to do a little reconnaissance first. They soon discover that this assignment won't be very easy at all. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it is packed with action from start to finish. So those who enjoy fast-paced action movies will probably like this film quite a bit. On the other hand, those who prefer a certain amount of realism are bound to be somewhat disappointed. Additionally, while Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham and Jet Li (as ""Yin Yang"") certainly had adequate screen time, others like Arnold Schwarzenegger (""Trench Mauser""), Mickey Rourke (""Tool"") and the aforementioned Bruce Willis made only cursory appearances which didn't affect the movie one way or the other. What a shame. In any case, although this movie was definitely unrealistic and lacked any depth, it was still entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

There is very plot development and nearly all the characters feel flat and one-dimensional. In fact, there really isn't a single character that stands out from others. Arnold Schwartznegger who's often taken lead roles of action films is blatantly underused, quite disappointing for many action fans. The cast performances aren't terrible, but nothing memorable and the cheesy dialogue certainly doesn't help. However, I found the performances a little more forgiving since these are veteran action stars we are talking about. On the bright side, the film manages to bring out the fun with it's high-kinetic action sequences, soaking the audience with intense 80s-style gun shootouts, blood and guts flying, and just enough explosions to make Michael Bay blush. The only thing that disappoints me about the action scenes is the use of CGI blood which I believe could use some improvement. <br/><br/>The Expendables has its entertaining, but perhaps nothing original. This certainly isn't one of the best of Sylvestor Stallone's works, but I think this is be pleasing for some, but definitely not all action fans. If this film put more effort into its plot development and character construction, this would have been much more entertaining film."

Sylvester Stallone leads a band of bad-asses to a war torn country where they blow up everything in sight. The characters are given very little background as it becomes very clear that Stallone's ambition is not in story but in casting every famous action star within reach. It is like a lineup of near retired action stars along with a few newer faces to the genre and nobody gives a sh*t about the whole charade. As director Stallone is more interested in showing off various angles to through a knife or shoot someone. It is one thing for Stallone to round up all of these famous names but why not write them into a story worth telling. This is all bang bang pow and whatever other word they use to describe action. Besides Stallone there is a slew of ass kickers including Jason Statham, Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren among others and they are all given their big chaotic action scene. Stallone plays the desperate hero who goes back into massive danger over a woman. Jet Li gets his ass kicked by Lundgren but we are given that witless conclusion where all is forgiven and Lundgren stands with that stupid grin on his face even though he tried to wrap Li's body around several solid objects. Mickey Rourke was wonderful in The Wrestler, but here he is just along for the ride with his fellow action buddies. This film is expendable in more ways than one and should be backed over by a truck.

Yet it's a good movie. <br/><br/>Stallone is not a bad director , but here he doesn't always do good job. The movie drags at times , especially in the first half . ""Expendables"" also feels too serious and too dark for it's own good. The moral dilemmas are very heavy handed . It feels like Stallone wanted to do his version of ""Seven samurai"" at places. Yikes. Thankfully there is some great macho dialogues and jokes here . <br/><br/>The action scenes themselves are well done.""Expendables"" is a movie that truly lives only during action scenes. The action scenes are done in modern way with a lot of quick cut editing , CGI blood and explosions. I have to say I was hoping for more old school approach. The CGI looks horrible at places. The editing is sometimes too quick , but overall the action scenes are quite powerful. The mayhem at the end is something you just don't see in modern action movies.<br/><br/>The plot is both simple and underdeveloped. The story was told before and is very overused by now. Stallone and Statham have the most screen time , while other characters struggle to find their place in the story. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis appear for 5 minutes and only talk. They don't take part in any of the action. What a waste ! Mickey Rourke seems like a pointless character . He makes one important , but terribly lame speech that made my head hurt. Thankfully Dolph Lundgren and Jet Li are entertaining as the crazy drug addict and always complaining karate fighter. The movie lacks good main villain. Eric Roberts or the general Mendoza don't seem really menacing or interesting. <br/><br/>Brian Tyler provides an energetic soundtrack. There is plenty of one-liners and in jokes references. The movie is rated R and makes a good use of it - a massive body count, loads of bone crunching action, explosions, bad guys getting gruesome payback.<br/><br/>Hollywood just doesn't make them like this anymore. I like the sequel slightly better , even if it wasn't perfect too. Thanks to Stallone and others for some good old school feven if it's not as good as it could be). I give it 6/10."

Jason Statham, is the cockney knife thrower, Jet Li is the short ass Kung Fu one, Dolph Lundgren is the mean drug addicted one, Mickey Rourke is the philosopher/tattooist. Terry Crews and Randy Couture round up the team.<br/><br/>The CIA hires The Expendables to eliminate a Latin American dictator and a renegade CIA agent (Eric Roberts). Stallone gets close to the rebellious daughter of the dictator and Roberts has a few nasty henchman of his own such as Steve Austin.<br/><br/>There is a lot of good action sequences but it has a slight storyline. Some very good explosions but the climactic scenes shot in the dark makes it difficult to see what is actually happening unless you have those night vision goggles.<br/><br/>Its a fun, no brainer action film. More enjoyable first time round but really does not stand up to repeated viewing. Its the best of the The Expendables franchise as it offers something fresh and the sequels got stale rather quickly."

","Serving as a homage to the blockbuster action films of the 1980s & 90s while also paying tribute to the action stars of past & present era, The Expendables is an adrenaline shot of old-school action extravaganza as well as a casting powerhouse featuring some of the biggest & baddest names in the Hollywood industry that solely relies on nostalgia to make its mark & pretty much succeeds.<br/><br/>The story of The Expendables concerns a group of elite mercenaries who are hired by a CIA operative & assigned a new mission to overthrow a Latin American dictator from his regime. While scouting the location, they discover the true nature of their mission with the help of a local & find out that the dictator is merely a puppet controlled by a ruthless ex-CIA officer.<br/><br/>Directed by Sylvester Stallone, the film suffers in its storytelling aspects for no time is utilized in developing its plot or characters & it's right down on business early on in the picture. The performances aren't any special either yet the charm of seeing so many notable actors working together casts its own spell & makes you enjoy the ride without giving much damn about the story.<br/><br/>The action is over-the-top yet finely choreographed, the scene featuring Stallone, Schwarzenegger & Willis together is a money-shot in itself, the entire cast clearly seems to be having great fun together but one thing I did wish it had was a formidable villain. On an overall scale, The Expendables is a film for those who grew up watching First Blood, Predator or Die Hard, and despite its lack of story, remains an enjoyable experience."

","Enjoyable in small doses but overall as pointlessly unoriginal as you'd expect.<br/><br/>This movie is basically founded on the premise that if you put together as ensemble cast of action heroes from Stallone's phone book, what could possibly go wrong?<br/><br/>Makes sense to me.<br/><br/>But sadly, I discovered that without a half-decent plot to speak of (I've honestly forgotten what the 'plot' was meant to be - something about drugs in Mexico I think) or any real originality in the action sequences, watching Stallone, Jason Statham and Jet Li kick ass repeatedly actually can be rather dull. I must be getting old.<br/><br/>It's an OK way to wile a way an evening I suppose, if you've got it to hand and there's nothing else on. That's as much as I can say in its favour."
"bowmanblue","7","0","0","9 September 2014"," Enjoyed and disappointed in this movie all in one
","Maybe I enjoyed action movies in the eighties and nineties too much. Basically, when I heard that this film was being made, I expected it to be the greatest action movie of all time. I mean... how could it possibly be anything else, based on the star-power included in the package? However, by the time the credits rolled, I was left with a sense of 'oh, was that it?' Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film immensely. It's about a team of unstoppable mercenaries who have to overthrow a fictional South American dictatorship which is secretly being funded by a rogue CIA operative. It was all good; I just expected more.<br/><br/>It's not that long and the action scenes, although they come thick and fast, were nothing that I hadn't seen a hundred times before.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that The Expendables was a 'homage' to action movies of the eighties. I can see how that applies. The film feels right at home in the eighties, i.e. a time before inflated studio budgets and when all 'action' was were big musclemen shooting a thousand faceless baddie troops. I suppose I expected modern day action scenes that were so big that I'd never seen anything like them before.<br/><br/>I've now watched The Expendables twice. I actually enjoyed it more the second time around because my expectations were lowered. Plus I've since seen the sequel (the imaginatively titled Expendables 2) which, in my opinion, is what the first film should have been.<br/><br/>If you like action movies, or are a fan of any of the many action heroes contained within, you'll probably enjoy this film. Just don't expect anything too new (and make sure you watch the sequel!). Stallone will be back (or is that Arnie?).<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","The Expendables was released in 2010 and is directed, written and starring Sylvester Stallone. It,s co-stars Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren and many more. This movie was is a throwback to the 80,s and 90,s action movies and does an okay favor to that premise but still has a hole lot of flaws. The Expendables is about Barney Ross who leads the ""Expendables"", a band of highly skilled mercenaries including knife enthusiast Lee Christmas, martial arts expert Yin Yang, heavy weapons specialist Hale Caesar, demolitionist Toll Road and loose- cannon sniper Gunner Jensen. When the group is commissioned by the mysterious Mr. Church to assassinate the merciless dictator of a small South American island, Barney and Lee head to the remote locale to scout out their opposition. Once there, they meet with local rebel Sandra and discover the true nature of the conflict engulfing the city. When they escape the island and Sandra stays behind, Ross must choose to either walk away and save his own life - or attempt a suicidal rescue mission that might just save his soul. The Expendables is an entertaining stupid movie but most of that entertainment comes from the stars and how fun it is to see all these actors come together and kick some ass together. But the flaw is that none of these stars has an real character unless Stallone, Statham, Rourke and Lundgren. And it,s really annoying that Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are terrible misused. The quality of the film is straight to DVD like with i'ts CGI blood effects and stupid script. There are some cool explosions and i'ts fun to see all these guys together. The Expendables is an entertaining action movie that you can turn you're brain off while watching it."

","The Expendables is a wild action movie, a story about a team of mercenaries called the Expendables, led by Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), on a CIA mission to eliminate Latin dictator David Zayas (General Garza) and renegade CIA agent James Munroe (Eric Roberts).<br/><br/>I actually saw The Expendables 2 and 3 before I saw this one. I've found it to have the same adrenaline pumping and no-nonsense plot, mixed in with some drama and humor where needed. There are also plenty of weaponry action, highlighted with wild special/visual effects that will sure make your head spin, and martial arts galore, including those brilliantly done by Jet Li.<br/><br/>However, I've also found that this first movie has a more serious and darker tone than its sequels and contained more violence, which were more than I could handle at times. The plot dragged a little at a few points throughout the film, especially during the scenes with Mickey Rourke's character.<br/><br/>I actually thought that the series works better with the added humor in them as found in Parts 2 and 3, but, the movie is still pretty good fun and is great for seeing the many action legends from the 1980s and 1990s together (Stallone, Lundgren, Li, Willis, Scharzenegger).<br/><br/>Grade B-"

","Continuing my plan to watch every Sly movie in in order, I come to the beginning of a franchise that really divides the fans, 2010's The Expendables.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: A mysterious A CIA operative, hires a team of mercenaries known as The Expendables, to eliminate a Latin dictator and a renegade CIA agent.<br/><br/>I can't believe it's been 6 years since this movie was released.After back to back success with Rocky Balboa and Rambo Sly was on a roll and excitement for this movie was high!! As with Rocky Balboa and Rambo, Sly stars, wrote and directed this movie. <br/><br/>I can still remember the onset pictures coming out almost daily, I remember the use of Arnie and Bruce Willis in the promotion of the movie was a big deal, and caused lots of arguments around here!! Andrew and Mark called it right, they were used, whilst I said they would not be. I love Sly's look in this, I liked the goatee look in Get Carter, and it's back here. <br/><br/>I love the scene with Sly, Arnie and Bruce together. I waited years for that, and it was a lot of fun. I remember leaving the cinema initially being disappointed, that Robert Knepper (T- Bag from Prison Break) wasn't in the movie, as it was announced he was. <br/><br/>All of the main cast get there individual moments to shine!! Jet Li and Lundgren get their solo fight, Couture has his fight with Austin, as does Sly, Cerews (who I like) has his moment with the gun, Rourke gets a passionate Speech and Statham has his fight on the basketball court.<br/><br/>Sly really brings the best out of Statham. Normally I find him very wooden if he is not actually fighting someone. He actually has some charisma about him here.<br/><br/>I think the movie had a great soundtrack too, mixing classic rock songs with Brian Tyler's score. <br/><br/>It has a few problems with it, some of the effects aren't the best, the General is a bit bland, it's a good job Roberts filled the void. There was a no real lack of concern for the Expendables, you never thought any of them would die, and I found the damsel in distress subplot dull.<br/><br/>What I did like was Sly showing his age, visible grey in his hair and beard, he needed saving from the soldiers by Statham when he was about to be shot, again by the gang in the tunnel and when he ""got his ass kicked"" by Austin. He relies on the team and never takes out a main villain on his own.<br/><br/>Another of the things I liked was the natural chemistry between Sly and Statham, who I have said I was not a fan of, pre this movie, they have the best rapport of anyone in the group. <br/><br/>Finishing with a domestic gross of $103 million, The Expendables ended the year the 28th highest grossing movie of the year. It was also the first Movie with Sly in a lead role, to gross over $100 million at the domestic Box Office since Rocky IV in 1985."

","Most of these action legends in this film have been around for decades, and have been giving us fun times with their action films from the start. Sylvester Stallone gives us what us fans have wanted for many years, and that is a film with so many great legends in one film. Sure the film isn't perfect but, if you want over the top action like we got in the 80s and 90, then this is a must watch film for everyone. This is my review of The Expendables.<br/><br/>The film was written by Sylvester Stallone and Dave Callaham. While the story and the setup isn't anything Oscar worthy, it fits a film like this perfectly. The film never needed to be flashy in the story department, and they never tried to be. Stallone is well known for over the decades for his roles in the drama genre like with the Rocky films and even the first Rambo film, First Blood. However, his action movie history is long and it is stellar. Callaham recently helped write the newest American Godzilla film but, is more known to us action fans as a writer of this Expendables franchise. The story as I said is nothing perfect but, it does sell you nicely on some of the background and build up over the film. While I wouldn't say there are any classic lines like Stallone is use to delivering in his action films, there are still some funny lines that you will be remembering. The film does drag early in the film as maybe they take the story too deep but, when the action really gears up, it is non stop until the very end. So in this department Stallone and Callaham get a nice passable grade for their writing.<br/><br/>This film was also directed by Sylvester Stallone. While over the years some have complained about the use of the so called shaky cam, I personally never once thought the action was unwatchable. While Stallone isn't known as a great action director, he really takes this film into his own, and with plenty of amazing action scenes, he shows just how his past experience has payed off. I'm a huge fan of the 80s and 90s action movies, and so many of those movies had over the top pieces of action. Well if you are like me then you will not want to pass up this film. While the start of the film is slower, from about the middle to the very end there are so many over the top action pieces that you would have thought you put in an 80s action film. While those cheesy one liners aren't as big in this film, the action is just about on the same level. Now on to the actors, or should I say legends of past action films. Of course everyone knows Stallone stars in the film but, we also get to see Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, and Let Li. The film as features some up and coming action stars like Steve Austin, Jason Statham, Gary Daniels, and Terry Crews. While you can easily say Lundgren or even Stallone steal the show, I must personally say that Terry Crews steals the show with his amazing scene towards the end of the film. Once you watch the film you will instantly know what I am talking about. The stars of the film are amazing together, and it is a real joy to see so many greats in one film together. Stallone gets high praise for his directing this film and for being able to bring so many of our favorites into one film.<br/><br/>Brain Tyler composed the score for this film. He is the composer of all the Expendable films, and has even recently done work on bigger films such as Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. While I personally love those cheesy scores from composers of the 80s, this score from Tyler doesn't really hold up against those films, and frankly no one should have expected it to, as this is a completely different day and age with much different technology. While I can't say Tyler does a great job, his score is good enough for this amazing film.<br/><br/>Overall, everyone should see this film at some point. Sure it may not be as amazing as those 80s action films but, Stallone and company give a fantastic effort, and this film should not be ignored. Huge fans of the genre have already watched this film many times over, and get excited every time a new film is released. If you haven't started watching these films yet, now is the perfect time. In my opinion, you will not regret giving this film a chance.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Lawrie-5","7","0","0","11 August 2014"," Action-Men: The Movie !!
","I remember reading about this in Total Film a few years back that after Sly revived Rocky & Rambo he was looking to recruit a squad of tough guys for what was being tagged as the ultimate action movie, and to say I was excited was understatement. Names were being thrown around left, right & centre on who would be in it. If the latest Rambo(2008) was anything to go by I knew this was going to be ace, or so I thought, well almost.<br/><br/>I reviewing this with the run up to EX3 just days away from release, and thought I'd start at the start. So watching this back (with Sly both behind, and in front of the camera) its a real throwback to everyone's favourite 80's flicks, there is real sense that Sly is trying to give us a real insight into the guys in the film (especially with Sly/Mickey/Jason's character) it worked more with Rambo as Sly is the only big name in the film, where as with all the names here even the poster was struggling to fit them in, but then again non-one is watching this for an Oscar nomination as its an action fest, just how it should be.<br/><br/>The action scenes are thick, fast and brutal but arrive in batches more towards that latter part of the film. In all honestly I did like Rambo more as action was its main driving force, Sly really want to deliver some plot and it does slow the film down at times, but I think he knows that as come the second film he steps down as Director and the balance of EX2 has way more laughs, even bigger names and action. So to sum up its great start to what could be a great franchise The one distracting factor throughout this and the 2nd film is the CGI is pretty poor and Rambo for that matter I notice that Lionsgate is behind these films so makes me question if its down to them) One more thing is Ex is rated at 18, EX2 at 15 and EX3 at 12A which sounds to me the violence is going to be pretty toned down but allows more bums on the seats so only time will tell."

","Okay this movie didn't totally suck, but in my point of view it wasn't great either. I hoped the movie would be more like RED, because then I liked it. <br/><br/>I didn't like the script, the one-liners weren't even that great. I hope for some cheesy one-liners after a big fight or a big boom, but it fell flat to the ground. I really question the intelligence of some people in this film, like Gunner. He's totally nuts and he doesn't make sense. First he is good, then he tried to kill Yin Yang and in the end he is good again and everybody accepted him, while he was kicked out in the beginning ?! It's just silly and stupid.<br/><br/>I also find it very weird that Arnold Swarzenegger and Bruce Willis where on the front of the DVD case. They made a 3 minute appearance ?! like what the hell, they are not even that important, more like: I show my face then we can get paid and more people will go to the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects where meh. It was so obviously fake it wasn't even funny... While we where an hour in the movie I could feel my thoughts drifting away and before I know it I was thinking about other stuff en 'missed' 30 minutes of the movie. But I didn't miss it, really, because when I was back again it was still the same fighting when I drifted away.<br/><br/>I eventually gave it a six, because it wasn't entirely bad, but it isn't my movie. I think I will skip the expendables 2 and directly move on to expendables 3, because it is almost in cinemas here."
"hetepheres21","9","0","0","18 July 2014"," what do you expect?
","A good movie..rather, one of my favorites. I'm not an action flick kind of person but I do enjoy an adrenaline laced lifestyle when affordable. I think the critics are highly biased and just plain negative when it comes to reviews (they expect high dollar, blockbuster masterpieces and nothing short of that). Many people are too, when the subject of Stallone's acting or directing rise. He's an actor, so to expect award winning directorial work is naive. A damn good one. Even in this film, he still maintains his rep, though watered down a bit. An action film with fans that hope for romance and comedy? Although the film supplies little of both (its action so what do you expect?), it provides enough to develop the characters for the storyline. To learn how to shape expectations may never be mastered. But to realize a good film given the efforts of actors and directors both despite its shortcomings is something we should be familiar with, especially since many classic films cannot be matched, merely ""redone."" I liked this movie quite a bit and was intrigued by negative reviews and so decided to put my two cents in. Thanks for reading."

","Going into watching this film you just simply must know what you were getting into an action film with one liners. This film has almost everybody in it but the main two are director Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham as the main members of the all star group The expendables who set out to take out a dictator and liberate a nation. The performances are what you would expect and great for this film every single one of them, also some awesome cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger who I hope to see both in the sequel more. The action is fantastic throughout but the last action scene oh my goodness is some of the best action there is ever and is clearly the best part of the film as expected. Dolph ludgren as the crazed ex member of the team was a cool dynamic also stone cold Steve Austin is great in action and Eric Roberts is an awesome villain like he always is. However, for a mindless action film there is some slow parts which I could have done without. Also I would have liked the characters of jet li, randy cetoure and terry crews to be expanded more instead. But this is an awesome film filled with everything you would expect."
"ikrani","7","0","0","12 March 2014"," Take a Hint, Michael Bay
","THIS is how one makes a soulless action movie: by taking a cast of likable and somewhat clichéd group of characters who are in to Creedence Clearwater Revival and put them through increasingly unforgiving gunfights.<br/><br/>But the Expendables isn't soulless. There are some moments that you can see the weight of the characters' pasts when they talk about some of the horrible sheit they've been through. There's a very subtle love interest for Stallone's character, Barney Ross, which never kisses him, fawns over him, or tries to sleep with him. The most they share is a hug at the very end.<br/><br/>All of the action celebrities are more or less playing culminations of their various roles in the past, none of which have believable names. But, to be honest, you probably won't care about their names because there is WAY too much crap trying to kill them for you to care.<br/><br/>This is probably the most '80s action movie I've ever seen. It makes the action scenes bigger and bigger and the characters more and more clichéd until you have one giant testosterone-fueled explosion of one-liners and, um, explosions.<br/><br/>Seriously, it's awesome."

","What do you get when you put almost every action star from the past 20 years in the same movie? You get The Expendables and you feel like a complete man watching it. The cast includes Stallone, Statham, Li, Austin, Crews, Couture, Rourke, Willis, Schwarzenegger, and my personal favorite Lundgren. In case you don't know who he is he is Drago from Rocky 4. I heard some people complain that the movie was stupid and had no story and point. To that I say, duh, that's not the point. This is a once in a lifetime franchise and for what it's worth it was fine. <br/><br/>This is a straight up action movie and has no other point then to see your favorite stars blow things up and kill people. The story is crazy, but who cares. I did not go see this movie for deep characters and an in-depth storyline. I saw this for the action and special effects. For an action movie, I loved it, for a movie in general, it was one of the worst I have ever seen. Stallone leads a group of mercenaries and he gets too attached to a job and he wants to return to rescue a girl. I guess the first rule of being a mercenary is not to get attached to the job. It's get in, get out, and get paid. For what it is it wasn't a terrible idea. If it had to be a story I'm glad it was this one. <br/><br/>A major flaw with the move itself is the fact that it tries too hard to be a movie that it isn't. After an action packed opener they go back home and try to dig into characters and that's not necessarily a bad thing but they tried too hard. Stallone has his internal conflict and talks it over with Rourke, and that's OK, but the whole story with Statham and his girlfriend could have been cut out and replaced with him snapping necks. I don't want to see Bruce Li complain about his family that doesn't exist or Mickey Rourke being completely useless throughout the entire movie. I hated his character. All he does is ride in, be a sad old man, and give tattoos. He tells this story about an old job and how he got attached to it and I was just turned off. I wanted him out of the movie. He is an action star and should have been that. Instead he was a has-been and drags the movie along. Even Stallone looked like he was getting bored. Bruce Willis' character was OK, I wanted to see him kill people too but instead he plays the guy who assigns the job and that's it. Anybody could have played that role and he was wasted as a name to promote the movie. I was OK with Schwarzenegger's character because he was governor at the time so it made sense. I guess I should praise the real point of the movie, the action. Nothing made me happier than seeing Terry Crews mow people down with a shotgun. The car chase with Stallone, Li, and Lundgren was impressive. It had the stupid one liner but cars flipping and bullets flying are what I wanted to see. Some of these actors are getting old but the gritty hand to hand combat still held up. The explosions in the beginning were just as good as the ones at the end. Stone Cold Steve Austin is in the movie as a bad guy and he fit in surprisingly well. He played a bad guy in the WWF so he knows what he is doing. His scenes were fun to watch and he was a good addition. Overall, The Expendables was exactly what I expected. It was a battle of men and a movie for a man. If you took your girlfriend to see this movie, I hope she broke up with you on the spot. The acting was gross, he story was choppy and stupid, but that wasn't the point. When people tell me this movie was bad I laugh and ask what they expected. I expected the bloodbath that I got so I was happy. As a movie it is terrible, but as an action movie it is top notch. The Expendables gets the WillyT Bloodbath Badge. That basically means it was a good action movie. If I had to give it a real WillyT Rating it gets the WillyT Recommendation because it is a movie every man needs to see to consider himself a man."
"jboothmillard","4","10","39","21 August 2010"," The Expendables
","From star, writer and director Sylvster Stallone, this was marketed like it was going to be the action film to end all action films, so I had relatively high expectations for it, it is just a shame it didn't quite offer what I had hoped. Basically the ""Expendables"" are a band of high skilled mercenaries, led by strategist Barney Ross (Stallone), working alongside members including former SAS soldier and knife enthusiast Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) and martial artist Ying Yang (Jet Li). We see one of their missions go to plan, but it almost doesn't with uneasy sniper Gunner Jensen (Universal Soldier's Dolph Lundgren) in the gang, and then Barney goes to find their next assignment. After old friend Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his first role since becoming Governor of California) allows his gang to take the job, Barney is assigned by ""Mr. Church"" (Bruce Willis) to go to Vilena, in the Gulf of Mexico, to overthrow brutal dictator General Garza (David Zayas). There they meet Sandra (Giselle Itié) who lets them in on why someone would want them to get rid of Garza, ex-CIA agent James Munroe (The Dark Knight's Eric Roberts) is backing his plans. Barney and Lee try to escape the situation, and they tell Church that the job is off, but they can't leave the country without leaving Sandra who wasn't eager to escape herself and almost allowed herself to get captured. After almost being killed by the betraying Jensen, Barney gets the whole team together, including weapons specialist Hale Caesar (Norbit's Terry Crews) and demolitions expert Toll Road (Randy Couture), to go and rescue Sandra. Once they start the dangerous and suicidal operation, they discover during that Sandra is the daughter of Garza, but they still kill him and Munroe in the end and save the day. Also starring Mickey Rourke as Tool the tattooist, Steve Austin as Paine and Charisma Carpenter as Lacy. The Schwarzenegger in-joke about wanting to be president is funny, and a few other one-liners are amusing, and obviously the explosions, action and guns blazing is quite good, but that's about it. It is good to see the big action stars of the 80's, 90's and today brought together (also remember that Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger started up Planet Hollywood together), but the story is too simple and predictable to care about much, a slightly disappointing but not rubbish action adventure. Okay!"

","First of all, do not believe the negative reviews you may read, because they were clearly written by people that don't appreciate action movies.<br/><br/>I let myself get swept up by the hype over the last few months, attended the premiere, and went into the cinema with very high expectations. I did previously read reviews of this film, a mixed bag of excellence, and disappointment...<br/><br/>The movie starts with an action scene, and the pace is suddenly slowed down, setting the scene, introducing characters, and also a very special encounter (nuff said). Then there are the odd few chunks of action and dialogue, which ultimately leads to easily the most epic action witnessed in any film. ever. Undoubtedly the most explosive, and exciting 30 minutes of any film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The actors do not act their age whatsoever, and even though they self criticize throughout the movie, they still look incredible, and fight as if they were in their prime. Whoever calls any one of them a has been is insane, the action scenes are as good as they were 20 years ago. They work wonderfully together, and the roles were cast perfectly, so well done to stallone.<br/><br/>The film is supposed to be a kick in the face to all the CGI, toned down, soul-less, story driven action films of today.<br/><br/>The Expendables amazingly possesses that charm that all the classic 80s action flicks had, a time when films didn't have to have overly thought provoking story lines to be popular, when all you needed, were some badass characters, gun fights, explosions, car chases and well timed one liners.<br/><br/>Don't go in to this film, expecting a thoroughly flawless, deep plot. Because i will break it to you now, Shawshank Redemption this is not.<br/><br/>Go in expecting to see the greatest action heroes of all time, doing what they do best. Prepare to laugh out loud at the truly epic one liners, and prepare to walk out that cinema with a massive smile on your face.<br/><br/>If i had one criticism, it would be the very shaky nature of the camera, especially during intense fight scene, perhaps a little unnecessary sometimes, but nothing too major.<br/><br/>This movie was made with one purpose, to entertain the hell out of you, and it without a doubt does that perfectly, so i will give this a well deserved 9/10"
"blackmamba99971","10","4","12","17 August 2010"," An excellent cast
","This was a great thrill ride of explosions, gun fights, fist fights, and a down right mean villain. Sylvester Stallone does it again with this top fuel race of hero's who are mercenaries for hire. Except their philosophy is, if it's too tough, hire someone else. To see great headliners such as Stallone and Li, Lundgren, Cotoure, Schwartzenegger, Willis, and Charisma Carpenter in one movie was a great treat. This is what you could call a good 'A' team but with extra testosterone. To see also Steve Austin play a relentless mean streaked one track killing machine was a nice touch. Seeing him kick Stallone's butt is no walk in the park, but with wrestlers its a good days job. This held all aspects of the good guys, to be hired for a one man hit only to take out a economic hit-man who is corrupting a leader which has no morals in the first place. Yet it does tell us, that the united states government should not be in countries that they have no business in. This is a good show of displaying government powers at work behind the curtains. And the only one's in the middle are the little guys who try to clean the mess up. This is a roller coaster ride for the action fans, the gun fans, and the villain fans, it has all a person needs to be satisfied at the end of the movie, sorry Julia Roberts. You just seem to be phasing out slowly, the fans are beginning to change sides."

","First of all... This movie is good. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year, and when I heard that it would be delayed, I was upset.<br/><br/>But I saw the movie yesterday in a really small and really hot theater. The cast for this movie was huge, Li, Statham, Lundgren, Rourke, Willis, Schwarzenegger and Stallone himself, WOW! But too bad Willis and Schwarzenegger had so little time on the screen.<br/><br/>I like: *What I really liked about this movie is that there is a lot of action scenes that reminds you of the 80's. Just pure action! *The acting was absolutely superb by all stars. *The humor that is put into this movie!<br/><br/>I disliked: *At some scenes in the movie the camera was so close-up that I had a hard time trying to see what exactly was going on.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this movie a lot, but after I stepped out of the theater I was still kinda disappointed, maybe I expected too much. Definitely see this movie on the big screen. You won't regret it!"
"s_campanale","9","4","12","15 August 2010"," A séance that raises the ghosts of 80s action cinema with magnificent success
","We just saw ""THE EXPENDABLES"" last night at a preview in London. We went in with a lot of fear and trepidation – Like all hyped movies there was a danger that all the excitement might collapse into a mass of disappointment, but fortunately this was not the case. ""THE EXPENDABLES"" has 2 mission statements. (1) Reunite the heroes of B-action movies from the last 3 decades and (2) Make a purposefully retro action movie in the style of the 1980s, something that seems to be becoming quite popular as that era fades away and a new generation exists who were never there. Happily it succeeds perfectly in both cases. Stallone hasn't really been off screen so we are used to him. Dolph Lundgrun, his classic sparring partner, though looked rather wasted and it was shock to see him again like this. My wife said he reminded her of Kris Kristofferson, but then that might just be the way Scandinavian tough guys age? Statham and Li, also former sparring partners, did their usual stuff alongside the old timers. Mickey Rourke was good in his cameo, which was obviously filmed during breaks from IRON MAN 2 as he was still wearing his Ivan Danko look. Willis has never been off screen and is anyway quite familiar in little cameos nowadays. Schwarzanneger's cameo was a short comedy triumph, something that takes us out of the movie for a couple of minutes as the two old rivals square up. The second aim, to make a retro 80's He-Man actioner was spot on! Stallone and the screenwriters made sure they ticked most of the boxes on the form – The plot was wonderful old school! Setting it in a fictional South American country (so as to offend no one) was also perfect, and of course it revolves around some half-assed Cocaine growing program (where would 80s action cinema have been without Cocaine?) The Villains were also spot on 80s vintage. General Garza and Munroe were just the kind of 1 dimensional half baked baddies our action heroes used to face off against, unthreatening, unscary unfit middle aged men with serious overacting problems who were usually played either by the over the hill character actors who needed the work or by members of the production staff doubling up!! (This is actually one case where Eric Roberts famous ""skills"" perfectly matched the character!) And of course this C-male villain had to have a real live wrestler as his henchman for heavy duty fights with the hero. (It was exciting in 2010 to see Stallone fight against another Wrestler baddie after the ""Rambo"" and ""Rambo III"" Soviet face offs. Plus of course Gary Daniels as kick-box henchman for Li and Statham to fight! ) Appropriately to the 80s genre, the women in this movie were both helpless victims there to be threatened and abused by bad men so they could be rescued by the good men. (This actually makes one think how far the representation of women has come in cinema in 25 years) The South Americans are also, in correct 80s mode, represented as primitive, backwards and living about 50 years behind the rest of us, helpless and cringing and in need of a big bad American saviour. The Action scenes were also 80s style, the ""run and shoot"", and though many have complained about CGI in some of them, bear in mind that they would have used it like this in the 80s had it existed. The Truck chase was also nice and 80s style, complete with crash and fight in (what else but..)a disused factory!! The look of the film also had that kind of smoky foggy look many 80s movies had, but cleaned up to fit 2010 standards. The dialogue was also perfectly 80s action, ie absolutely terrible, embarrassing to deliver and painful to hear, and apart from Rourke's much commented ""Bosnia"" monologue, the supposed moments of ""drama"" (Statham's love life problems, Garza's conflicts with Munroe about his daughter) have that same beloved sub-daytime soap feel about them. So as a teaming of the ageing Titans it works and as a Séance calling of a long dead genre it also works beautifully. Leaving the cinema we felt that wonderful rush of nostalgic glee one used to feel coming out of the fleapit. Of course it also makes you realise how far cinema, and indeed the world, has come since then. We live in less innocent times now, and watching those old movies again on DVD makes one realise this. The world has to go forward, but sometimes it is nice to have something from the old country once in a while, and this delivers it with style!! Alas many critics and members of the public have damned this film for having a rubbish story, pathetic villains, wooden acting, atrocious dialogue, sexist and racist attitudes, cheap look and mindless action, perhaps forgetting that this is the whole point! What they are damning is 80s action cinema, and B-movie genre pictures in general, as critics have always done anyway. But which movies do people flock to see on a Saturday night with their friends or partners? What gives us a jolt of guilty pleasure with a big tub of popcorn and a mega coke? Even down to today's B-Movie masters like Luc Besson and Paul WS Anderson, it is this hated cinema which makes the money for all the other projects, which keeps cinemas running, and which"
"jon.h.ochiai","8","4","12","15 August 2010"," Stand for Something
","Sylvester Stallone's mercenary Barney Ross asks fellow ""Expendable"" Tool (grizzled Mickey Rourke) why he is haunted by freedom fighter Sandra (beautiful Giselle Itie), daughter of the South American dictator. With incongruous gravity Rourke says, ""Because she stands for something"" Tool says ""We stand for sh*t."", and they haven't stood for anything for a long time. Barney listens in silence to this wake up call. Director and Writer Stallone's ""The Expendables"" is completely entertaining, and at times puzzling in its diverging context. Both Rourke and Stallone are compelling in this scene-- the story's emotional arc. Displaced all within the swirling firepower, exquisitely orchestrated beat downs from Jason Statham, Jet Li, and Randy Couture, and bloody body count. In one sense ""The Expendables"" is accurately represented by rogue CIA operative gone despot Munroe (savory evil Eric Roberts), who calls it ""bad Shakespeare"".<br/><br/>The tag is not a knock, instead more an ambitious or pretentious affect of the screenplay by Stallone and David Callaham. ""The Expendables"" lead by Barney (Stallone) are a group of biker mercenaries—former Company operatives, who were the best. Barney meets with mysterious Church (Machiavellian Bruce Willis) and CIA ""contractor"" Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Church will pay Barney $5 million to kill General Garza (David Zayas), military dictator of a South American island. Of course, the mission is not officially CIA sanctioned. Lee Christmas (cool and solid Jason Statham) inquires with Barney, what the real mission is, and whether the Expendables are being set up. Yin Yang (low key funny and strong Jet Li) only wants to know if he can get more money-- he has family issues.<br/><br/>Barney and Lee, who suffers recent estrangement from girlfriend Lacey (gorgeous Charisma Capenter), both fly off to the island for mission recon. Surprisingly, their contact is Sandra (Itie), who turns out to be General Garza's daughter. Here the action is spectacular and the cinematography of Brazil is vibrant. Jason Statham is awesome precision as he dispatches of Garza's men with kicks and blades. The destruction of the island port during the escape is exaggerated and breathtaking. Stallone delivers the goods throughout ""The Expendables"".<br/><br/>In the opening scenes during the daring rescue of hostages from Somalian Pirates, we learn the Expendables are deadly. Barney (Stallone) is as fast as light with a gun. Lee (Statham) is silent death with knives. Yin (Li) is the master martial artist. Demolitionist expert Toll Road is mix martial arts champion Randy Couture. Weapons specialist Hale Caesar is solid and funny Terry Crews. Dolph Lundgren plays the tormented expert sniper Gunner—he is an addict and liability to the team. Tool is the equivalent of Bond's ""Q"" and the emotional anchor of the story. Then again, the amazing Rourke did the same in this summer's ""Iron Man 2"". In a great scene Rourke poignantly reminds us even in the midst of the high testosterone and broad narrative strokes of the costs of war, and losing one's very soul.<br/><br/>Rourke, Stallone, and Statham make ""The Expendables"" work. Rourke is a good foil for Stallone's battle weary Barney. Stallone looks totally shredded, displaying Tool's tattoo art. He is solid and acknowledges his age in this story. In a savage fight with Munroe's henchman Paine (merciless Steve Austin), he admittedly gets his ass kicked. Stallone wisely leaves the heavy lifting to the younger Jason Statham. Statham also looks amazing, and has a wry sensibility as Lee. On film he is a stunningly dramatic martial artist. In the most satisfying devastating fight scene he tells Lacey's boyfriend, who beat her, ""Your life-- I was thinking about taking it!"" Fortunately, he is a merciful man of his word. Jet Li does not have much to do here. Although he has an electrifying fight scene with Lundgren's Gunner, who towers about a foot over Li. Li is explosive. Lundgren is up to the task being a former heavyweight kickboxing champion. All the fighting sequences in ""The Expendable"" are executed with brutal precision. I was in awe watching Randy Couture slam 250 pound men to the ground so effortlessly.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Expendables"" delivers on the action and then some, and Mickey Rourke infuses the right touch of gravitas. ""The Expendable"" is so entertaining, and I would be up for seeing a sequel."
"mikhail007","6","4","12","14 August 2010"," Entertaining but fails to use its full potential
","Expendables had very high expectations due to its stellar cast. So I was very excited to see the movie although I knew high expectations often lead to disappointment. After watching the movie, I felt like it failed to realize its action movie potential although I still enjoyed watching it.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple but works well and is what you would expect from an action flick. There are a few really awesome action scenes but most are just OK. It wasn't quite as gory and shocking as Stallone's other recent action flick, Rambo 4. The dialogue between characters was entertaining for the most parts but some of the punch-lines left me with a feeling that there will be tumbleweed moving across the screen in the background. The biggest disappointment came from the fact that most of the cast, other than Stallone and Statham, get very little screen time. Willis and Schwarzenegger are just cameos and don't even shoot anyone. It still boggles my mind how a movie with two of my favourite action heroes don't even let them kill anyone.<br/><br/>So overall, it's still worth watching this movie on the big screen just to see all of the action heroes in one movie, however it definitely doesn't live up to its expectations.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"
"Boba_Fett1138","5","3","8","15 August 2012"," Just not a very good genre movie.
","Seems that this movie was a case of being one that everybody wanted to like and love and therefore it's hard to admit for most people that this just isn't being a very good movie. By all rights it should had been a big, fun action flick, that could had worked as a throwback to the '80's, with lots of the big action movie stars from that era in it as well but it just doesn't works out as such.<br/><br/>So many problems with this movie, I don't know where to being. Guess it's best to start of with the most obvious thing; the story. No, this movie does not have a very good story in it. So what, you might say or think. After all, this is a action-flick, who needs story? Well, you always need at least something to base your action scenes around and you at least have to be taken by its characters or its main plot. There has to be a reason to root for the main characters and cheer when the main bad guy gets killed and the hero(es) saves the day! There is just however none of that present in this movie unfortunately.<br/><br/>There besides isn't really being a pleasant flow to the movie and its story. It seemed as if some action scenes were simply thrown in and don't serve a purpose at all. It actually in a weird way slows the movie down and makes it somewhat of a boring one at times. I personally couldn't wait for this movie to end, even though its only being 103 minutes short.<br/><br/>Perhaps it also was due to it that I just wasn't very impressed with the movie its action. It was shockingly poorly directed at times! I say shockingly, since the movie actually got directed by Sylvester Stallone, who had no problems with doing action scenes before. After all, this is the guy who also directed ""Rambo"", just 2 years prior to this movie, which was an action movie that I absolutely loved and was being everything that this movie should had been as well but just wasn't.<br/><br/>So is it at least fun to watch all of the big action movie stars from the past and present in this? Not really. It's at least not being somewhat to get terribly excited about, even though it on paper looks awesome. Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, Terry Crews, Mickey Rourke, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis all in one movie, how could it not work out as anything awesome? Well, mostly because most of them get absolutely nothing to do in this movie. It tries to present itself as a team movie but in fact the movie isn't at all about them working together. All of the egos in this movie are far too big for that and besides, the movie is mostly focusing purely on Stallone and Stratham, who by far have the most screen time in this and are the only ones doing some true action related stuff and have some character development.<br/><br/>Reason why I also wasn't being very entertained by this movie was because it just wasn't being a very fun one to watch. The supposedly comical dialog for the movie was awful and the movie was also lacking a good visual style to it. The movie is an incredibly dark one and I couldn't even always tell what was going on exactly. It might sound strange but a little bit more bright colors could had added so much to the movie its fun and entertainment factor. Perhaps they were more focused on trying to pass this as a legit action flick, while in fact it seemed to be a more suitable thing for this movie to not take itself as serious as it did.<br/><br/>A thing that worked also distracting for me was its Brian Tyler musical score. It was some incredibly formulaic stuff, that sounded like it got composed before the movie even finished shooting. It just didn't suited the movie and its action sequences in particular all that well.<br/><br/>It really isn't a good throwback to the '80's and also far too lacking as a genre movie in general. Lets hope the sequel does everything right, this one did wrong! If that's the case, then its going to be something absolutely awesome! <br/><br/>5/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","10","3","8","19 December 2011"," A Fun Movie For Anytime Of The Day
","In some cases, having a large cast of actors is not the best idea. Sometimes the chemistry just isn't there. An example of this would be like City Heat (1984). It was not an awful movie but it wasn't great and I thought that Reynolds and Eastwood were not the best choices for the movie. On the other hand, you get your occasional movies with a great cast AND they work well off each other. The Expendables is one of these great films, and that's only the tip of the iceberg.<br/><br/>The Expendables are a deadly team of mercenaries that are hired to take out certain individuals. In a sense, they are like The A-Team (2010), but a little more unforgiving. At least we get this feeling from the MPAA rating and we see it throughout the film. Sylvester Stallone who hasn't directed his own set of films in a while besides Rambo (2008) and Rocky Balboa (2006) has done a superb job with this film. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the interactions between the main characters. I say this because the screenplay seemed so laid back, but in good way. The Expendables are trained killers, they show no mercy to the people they must kill, BUT they also show some light heartedness. The trailer itself shows an example of this; in the beginning when there is a Mexican standoff, one of the character's phones vibrates and one of them asks, ""What's that"", ""I'm getting a text"", ""Excuse me"". Its simple but funny dialog like this that made me admire the film even more.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone stars as the leader of The Expendables along with a whole slew of other good actors that make this film really only a guy would like. Yes there are some women in this film and they are attractive but this movie's main theme is not romance. It is a ""Blow 'em up real good!"" film. Before I went to go see this film, I heard from other viewer's comments saying how it's only in theatres for its enormous explosions. Isn't this not what action and adventure are about? Explosions are practically half the ""action"" in any action adventure movie! That's what people like about this kind of genre.<br/><br/>One other feature that I liked about this movie was the energetic soundtrack provided by talented composer Brian Tyler. For any movie involving action I feel that it should be backed up by good music and Tyler does this well. Throughout this film, you will here a lot of strings and timpani and the way it is used is great. This plus all the action you will experience will keep your eyes glued to the screen because this movie is done so well.<br/><br/>Much of the violence is heavy during this film, but for any action adventure lover, The Expendables will pack the punch they're looking for. Even more fun will be listening to the screenplay and dynamic soundtrack by Brian Tyler."
"dfranzen70","7","3","8","16 June 2011"," Solid escapism
","The Expendables is a bad-ass movie. It's a real throwback to the mindless action movies of the 1980s, and as an added flourish it even brings back some of the stars of those cheesefests. It's certainly not plot heavy, but it delivers what it promises – nonstop action, easily identifiable bad guys, and the occasional bon mot or two.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone plays Barney Ross, leader of a team of mercenaries. Ross is hired by the mysterious Mr. Church (note: not his real name) to travel to a remote island and overthrow a dictator. But, naturally, things aren't quite as they seem, although plenty of stuff blows up. Later, to redeem his soul, Ross returns to the island to set things aright, and more stuff blows up.<br/><br/>Ross's team includes knife man Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li), weapons expert Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), demolitionist Toll Road (Randy Coutre), and sniper Gunner (Dolph Lundgren). Church is played by an uncredited Bruce Willis, and that's not a spoiler, since he featured in the trailer. Also in the trailer, showing up for one scene, is Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>Thankfully, we're spared some real cheese, such as an ""I'm getting too old for this"" line or other references to the ages of some of the cast. Also along for the ride is Mickey Rourke as the owner of a tattoo parlor/bar, Eric Roberts and Stone Cold Steve Austin as bad guys. All are good at what they do, and truth be told Rourke brings plenty of effortless charisma to his minor role. This is not a movie that's miscast, and it's not a buyer's-remorse movie, either. You get what you expect to get when you mix these actors and this plot.<br/><br/>The movie's not heavy on plot. I've already touched on the high points, but really you could pop in at any moment during the film and pick up the storyline in no time. It's not Memento, for crying out loud. It's violent, very bloody, and terrifically well choreographed. The filmmakers wisely shot some of the more intense fight scenes in the dark, the better to mask the perhaps-not-awesome fighting abilities of some of the actors. But even though the action never lets up, it's not impossible to follow, and neither is it implausible. Okay, maybe a little disbelief must be suspended, but for the most part it's all reasonable.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. The Expendables proved to me that solid action movies that don't depend on a name brand can survive, as this one did rather well financially – well enough that a sequel is planned. It's not a disappointing movie if you like explosions and other manly pursuits. There are car chases, hot women, plenty of guns, exotic locales, and some plot. What more could you want?"
"ghostphace","8","3","8","12 April 2011"," 80's movie
","I only saw this movie because I happened to be with my friend's parents. They, being of an older generation were natural fans of Stallone and the action stars of yesteryear. I never would have seen this if not for that catalyst, even though I'm a fan of Stallone's movies. I've never considered him an actor, just an action star who serves up some solid entertainment and fun, and that's exactly what I got here.<br/><br/>The story itself was a bit lame. It reminded by of an 80's Arnold movie like Commando. The writing wasn't all that good either. Mickey Rourke was the movie's one shot at any acting credibility and his screen time was so limited that that aspect was almost non existent. A few little gimmicks like Arnold and Bruce having cameo's, and funny one liner's like ""he wants to run for president"" gave it some spice. By far the best scene was the action scene with Jason Statham at the basketball court. No romance was existent here but none was needed as it's a straight guy flick."
"CumClarity","5","3","8","15 September 2010"," Expendable was... Well, Expendable...
","First off, let me say, when I saw this trailer in theatres my first thought was ""Oh... My... God... this is going to be AWESOME!"" Now i didn't look this movie up on IMDb or anything, before i went to see it, and perhaps i should have.<br/><br/>The actors i was looking forward to seeing most in this movie were : Arnold, Bruce, Jet, Jason, Mickey and Randy.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of action, it doesn't even need a fantastic, I'm okay with plot holes, some bad acting, etc etc... I am easy to please.<br/><br/>This movie was an epic failure, mainly due to my disappointment with Arnold only having 2 minutes of screen time and Bruce only 5, Mickey was in it a little more, yet didn't take any part of the action.<br/><br/>Jet Li got his ass kicked several times, which may be expected since he was playing with big boys, but it often seemed he needed help to get out of it. Something i thought detracted from my expectations of him kicking ass! Randy was... well randy....<br/><br/>The movie didn't give you a lot to go on, an average basic and uninteresting plot : Stallone leads a team of mercenaries to go after a girl who is held in a supposedly impenetrable fortress held by a general gone bad taking bribes from an American and his body guard.<br/><br/>There was nothing to make you understand the connection between the mercenaries, nothing to make you really even care or like about them, except for maybe Jason S. who is give s tiny bit of character depth.<br/><br/>Mickey R. had a cool little monologue, that was filmed with lots of mood lighting and tight close ups. that was the highlight of his character.<br/><br/>Everything else was just stuff happened to guys you didn't really care about. You wouldn't have cared about who you cheered on.<br/><br/>I even noticed that Steve A. punches a girl full force in the face. She is still conscious with a bit of blood coming out of her nose, which i found historical! with the force of his punch he should have dislocated her jaw, or shattered her cheek bone, yet later we see her and she looks perfectly fine for having been tortured and all that. And doesn't Steve know you don't hit the head first in an interrogation? The action was indeed very very cool. Some sick action sequences, knife throwing which looked cool and some gory focus on ripping and twisting the blade.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie starts off with a bang, which was probably the coolest part of the whole movie.<br/><br/>How every i found the direction style horrible, he cut too soon from the actual action to focus on explosions, he didn't allow time for you to get the gist of some of the cooler moves, choosing to use them in quick clips in order to keep you on your toes, when in reality it detracted from the action.<br/><br/>scripting was meh, except for maybe mickey R and Jason S. it was short and had a super synthetic feel for it.<br/><br/>and of course at the end Stallone leaves the girl he fought so hard over, which is his typical hardened lone wolf thing... like yeesh, get a new ending for your movies! I would have given this a lower rating had it not been for the cool weapons, and some of the cool knife throwing.<br/><br/>the acting was average, yet there was nothing to make you care about these men at all.<br/><br/>plot was unoriginal with no twists or anything unique.<br/><br/>My suggestion is go see that RED movie which has some older actors playing CIA agents on the loose. it looks like it will be much better."

","The film is forced, predictable, and brainless. The plot makes no sense and replaces plot for machismo. The scenes were thought up to provide self-reverential homages to former action stars; replace the nostalgia for current actors and all excuse for a film disappears. One need only see the scene between Planet Hollywood alumni Stallone, Willis, and Schwarzenegger to see the phony emptiness behind this plastic film- absolutely worthless and meaningless in terms of plot. The actors are given soliloquies to emote with which, no matter the background music, again signify nothing. I appreciate that this was never intended to rival Shakespeare, but at least 80s films tried to engage the emotions of the viewers; this is simply a paint-by-numbers exercise with many of the colours missing. www.tracesofevil.blogspot.com"

","See it Now! My Critical Perspective: B- Personal Perspective: A-<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone first was Rocky. Then he was Rambo and now he is Barney Ross, the leader of The Expendables. He is the ultimate action hero, but is not alone as he directs some of Hollywood's biggest action heroes of the past 40 years. (Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Bruce Willis, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren AKA The Russian from Rocky IV, Arnold Schwartzenegger, Steve Austin, Randy Couture and Mickey Rourke) <br/><br/>The Good: The film is exactly what you think it is going to be which is a testosterone packed action fest. The film knows its identity and does not go onto unnecessary tangents sub stories. The whole point of the film is to get these actors together to kick some major ass! <br/><br/>The Bad: The film does not totally develop all of the characters and tends to focus mainly on two or three of the expendables (Sylvester Stalone, Jason Statham, and Dolph Lundgren). Also, there are some scenes that are unclear and confusing and do not seem to flow very well.<br/><br/>Final Thought: The stunts and special effects combined with these action heroes make the film what it is a nonstop action film with no strings attached. A very enjoyable flick! Therefore, I recommend to See It Now! In theaters!"

It's a guy movie and should be viewed as one with the exception that all the stars are big time action hero icons (well for the most part) and sometimes having big stars counts as something. I mean if I saw a film with all the hottest actresses in Hollywood fighting each other, believe me I would pay to see it. (especially if it had Megan Fox). Now as a stand alone film, it doesn't bring anything new to the table, it's your basic shoot em up flick. But the action sequences in this film are shot so well, I promise the audience won't be bored. So the plot goes something like this ""A team of mercenaries head to South America on a mission to overthrow a dictator"" Enough said, throw in a little background story here, a little character development there, and you have ""The Expendables"". A proud homage to the action films of the 80's and 90's when it was just Hero's vs. Villains.<br/><br/>But that's pretty much all this film has going for it. Everything else is generic action film BS. The plot, the characters, hell even the villain was pretty generic, and it's kinda predictable. We all know how these films end right? But despite those flaws I found it quite enjoyable! The fight scenes themselves are pretty awesome to watch, I mean the fight scene between Dolph Lundgren and Jet Li was fantastic! Who doesn't want to watch ""The Punisher"" go up against ""The One""? The only thing I wished this film had more of was back story. Most of the characters are just Badass Mercenaries, we don't know much about their past, other than they know how to kill people in gruesome ways. Besides that the only people the film focuses on was Jet Li, Sylvestor Stallone, and Jason Statham. I wanted more of Arnold's Character! But overall I liked it, a solid 7 stars for me. The last half hour of this movie is like an explosive roller coaster ride, and it's for the action fanatic in all of us. There's a scene in particular I found to be absolutely breathtaking, it's the scene where Sylvester Stallone has to haul ass through a Pierre and jump onto an cargo airplane just as it's taking off, the look on his face as he's running is freaking priceless! (Yes ladies and gentlemen, Sly's still got it!). So all in all, it's pretty much a guy flick, fella's you won't be disappointed, ladies, you might want to watch Twilight instead. My rating: Matinée"
"d_art","7","3","8","5 September 2010"," ""The Expendables"" is old school with both good and the bad
","In this new action film directed by Sylvester Stallone, Barney Ross (Stallone) leads a gang of highly skilled mercenaries, which includes knife-expert Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li), heavy weapons specialist Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), demolitionist Toll Road (Randy Couture) and sniper Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren). They are hired by Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) to assassinate a dictator General Garza (David Zayas) on a South American Island called Vilena. While there, Barney befriends local rebel Sandra (Giselle Itié), whom he takes it upon himself to rescue from the dictator and his pal, the rogue ex-CIA operative James Munroe (Eric Roberts).<br/><br/>As of late, I had found Sylvester Stallone-directed films to be a good vacation from all the colorful, CG-fied, bloodless, MTV-style dizzying action flicks out there (I'm looking at you, A-Team). I enjoyed both his Rocky Balboa and the new Rambo. They're great guy films with guys who look like guys. They're also meaner and unsophisticated. And, that's okay—action heroes don't have to be sensitive, domesticated and ""whipped"" men.<br/><br/>Now that I have seen the film, I got mostly what I expected and wanted, yet, I did wish there was more to it. The Expendables is a great idea on paper, having all the old-school 80's action stars together to go on a mission to take on some big baddie. Now, the hard part is to make it all work together as a whole, and that's where the film falters a bit. It's unevenly balanced as certain side characters became more simplified than others and the central plot regarding the dictator gets lost occasionally. Sylvester Stallone is in good form as his usual action hero self, with good-natured banter and lots of tattoos. Jason Statham gets good screen time, and Jet Li gets some action in. Dolph Lundgren is in great form, looking more dangerous and meaner this time around. Eric Roberts bring a lot of fun energy as the well-dressed, quick-talking villain, James Munroe. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger make brief appearances. Mickey Rourke is engaging in his brief moments of dialogue.<br/><br/>This film truly soars when there is action. They're often bloody and very messy. I found the lack of CG, the plethora of explosions (and people jumping from it) and chopped limbs falling off unrealistically pretty fun to watch. It's messy in that hard-action 80's sort of way. At the same time, some of the action scenes were hard to follow due to many quick cuts in the editing. I would have preferred to see long takes when Jet Li is doing his scenes, personally. Sylvester Stallone still seems quite fit for his role, using everything from guns to bone-cracking hand-to-hand combat.<br/><br/>The film's pacing feels rather stagnant outside the action scenes. The dialogue, for the most part, is cheesy 80's macho stuff, but fun. They are not very descriptive, but the delivery is good. There are no references to modern pop culture, which is a plus. Most of the character focus is on Barney (Stallone) and Lee Christmas (Statham), while the others became more two-dimensional. The story meanders from the central plot with a change of scenery with a side plot regarding Lee Christmas' love life and an altercation with Gunner Jensen. The scenes are a lot of fun in themselves, but do not particularly mesh too well with the whole.<br/><br/>This film is essentially a celebration of the 80's action film—the macho flick with explosions and tough talk. There are certainly plenty of that here, despite some unevenness. I think the story could've been more focused and I may've preferred if the whole story took place at Vilena instead of going back and forth. Admittedly, with the all-star cast, my overall expectation may have been a tad high. I did enjoy it more than The A-Team, though.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews you can follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art"
"chaithuishere","8","3","8","5 September 2010"," Three things::::Blood::::::Bullets:::::::Blades
","What made me go for the movie is easy to guess. The cast. When i first came to know about, i thought Oh man! half of the action crew is here. Adding to that there are a couple of surprises in the form of cameos. For a moment you would think it is a School reunion kinda thing going on on the screen. And by the way, EXPENDABLES is just a title. <br/><br/>No part in the movie lives up to it. The movie starts off with a usual introduction ""mission"" like in any other ex-military mercenary movie. The plot is of average depth and keeps you go going. But i can promise one thing that you will never run out of adrenalin. Mickey Rourke of ""The wrestler"" fame was a mere waste. One can say he was there and nothing else except for a sad flashback which is kind of hard to believe when it comes from a man like our mickey. Also, He ended up showing his huge pot belly..:-( <br/><br/>About our John Rambo, he looked a bit too old for some scenes nevertheless its treat to watch him still going.I missed you Syl. He plays the role Barney,the undoubted leader of our little Expendables the good guy by default even thought he kills loads of people and deals in loads of money. <br/><br/>Our transporter plays Lee Christmas,a knife throwing mercenary with a soft side of life. Jason pulled it rather well and his one liners in his typical accent which were expected of him weren't so bad too. Like always, Jason stays at the heart of every action sequence. Jason, we just love you. <br/><br/>Among others, Jet Li was a joke. Starting from the name of his role ""Ying Yang"" , he was made to look stupid. You won't find much his quick moves rather end up musing over his silly ""small"" dialogs. <br/><br/>David Zayas of Dexter(TV) fame who is portrayed as the evil dictator is up-to the mark but his character is weak. The chick was completely unable to induce any hormones. Come on, you put together five or six huge male celebrities, What happened to the other sex. The audience could use more glamor on the screen.<br/><br/>All in all, Expendables promises entertainment apart from the shortcomings from the direction of SYL. Script is straight and to the point without any twisters but climax was a mess. Except for the WHOLE THING BLOWING apart bit, Nothing is clear. <br/><br/>All these in my mind, i push my rating towards 3.5 on a scale of 5. You will definitely find THREE B's from the flick. Bullets----Blades---- Blood.<br/><br/>If you are gonna watch it, watch out for those CAMEO surprises."
"whiteshadow1606","6","3","8","4 September 2010"," It's OK. But kinda disappointing..
","The vote is count for the action in the movie. I love action movies. This movie has it.<br/><br/>But, i kinda disappointed with the plot. It's weak. I can't see any interesting plot in this movie. The action is good. There are lots of bombing scenes, gunfires and stuffs and I think that what makes the movie fun to watch.<br/><br/>The characters are not properly developed. I really thought that this movie is about the team, like the A-Team. But, i kinda disappointed when it is only focused on the 2 characters; Stallone and Statham. The others don't really have the chance to shine. It's a shame though.<br/><br/>Overall, it's OK. Action-addict film may absolutely enjoy this film."
"adi-cat","Null","3","8","1 September 2010"," It's sooo cool to see so many one-man-show guys in a single show
","I don't know what the whole lot of guys who are complaining about this movie were expecting, but clearly they either didn't know Stallone's movies very well or took the wrong decision of going into the theater when they should have been elsewhere.<br/><br/>If I want to watch opera I don't go an Iron Maiden concert. So, my question to all those who are complaining is: WTF were you doing in the cinema, in the first place? If you're all about elaborate plots, deep character developing, moving emotions and character studies you should have stayed home or have found another movie to watch.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't SUPPOSED to develop characters that much: it has a main cast made entirely of guys who are usually the stars of a one-man-show type of movies, each in their own right. When one sees such a cast, you'd at least assume that there's going to be a lot of fighting, blowing, wrecking... whatever. That doesn't leave much time for character development but it doesn't necessarily means that the movie isn't A LOT OF FUN.<br/><br/>This movie ROCKS! It never takes itself too seriously and neither should anybody else. It's more or less a no brainer. The plot is just enough to set up the stage for the action scenes. But once you acknowledge that, you'll be able to enjoy tons of mind-blowing action, fights, car chase, explosions and gore in the good ol' fashioned way of the 90-ies.<br/><br/>Any fan of a game called Serious Sam should know exactly what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Some other guys picked on the fact that one or another of the actors look old. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Is that even an argument? Some of these guys are old. So what? Have your brains been so much spoon-fed with the Hollywood ""forever-young"" metrosexual image that you can't engulf the idea of old age? These characters are supposed to be old soldiers and mercenaries, so what if their faces are a little ""roughed up""?<br/><br/>Anyway, to make a long story short, if you like tons of cool testosterone-filled action without intricate plots, and you weren't yet turned into an emasculated whining bitch by the ""modern society"", then you'll probably find at least something to like into this one.<br/><br/>I certainly did like it, so the movie and Stallone along as a director get a 10/10 for lots of fun and adrenaline-pumped action."
"dave1033a","7","3","8","31 August 2010"," Action as action should be!!!
","Over the last 10/15 years action films have fallen by the wayside, and by that i mean the typical action film, not films with action in them.<br/><br/>I'm talking about the action films of old, the good old fashioned 80's action flick!! <br/><br/>When CGI Explosions were something of the future and the only way to portray a man flying through the air after a vehicle blowing up was to throw a stuntman through the air after blowing a vehicle up!!! <br/><br/>The Expendables is a nod to the action pictures of old and it doesn't apologise for that. <br/><br/>If you go to this movie expecting a compelling storyline or Oscar worthy acting, then you will be disappointed, However if you go into this film expecting lots of shooting, stabbing, explosions, guys doing things ni-on impossible then you will love it!! <br/><br/>I was psyched when i heard this was being made and even more when i had heard who was in it. However, do not expect that ""scene"" to make the movie as it doesn't, it makes you giggle as ""subtle"" jibes are made at each actor, but it is comedic. <br/><br/>I just think they should have kept the cameos under wraps but hey ho...<br/><br/>And... Where the hell was Chuck Norris?!?!?!?! He would have made this the ultimate retro action picture...<br/><br/>I loved it and you will too if you like the Die Hards, Lethal Weapon, Tango & Cash, Delta Force, MIA and any other 80's action film you know and love..<br/><br/>All the actors play their parts well.. I actually think Statham is the best in this film and that is saying something coz this guy cannot act.<br/><br/>So all in all a great movie i would recommend to everyone.. But not girls!!! ;)"
"3xHCCH","7","3","8","28 August 2010"," Slam Bang Action and Nothing More
","This is a movie that does not hide what it was all about. This is most definitely a MAN's movie. The first poster shows an array of firearms and knives surrounding a skull, no doubt this would be a violent action extravaganza. The list of the actors in this project confirm just the same: Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Austin, with a couple more superstars: Rourke and Willis.<br/><br/>The story is threadbare and overused. A ragtag bunch of American mercenaries were assigned to overthrow a dictator in a South American island country. That sounds like ""The A-Team"", I know, but that is the plot as it is. As can be expected, having a multiple big name cast would mean that not everyone would get a fair exposure.<br/><br/>Since he is the star, director and writer, Sylvester Stallone got the meatiest part as the leader of the group. He was mumbling his lines as usual, which was fine since it is probably non-essential anyway. His face looks like it is about to melt though. Jason Statham was quite good as the knife expert. He was cool and relaxed in all his fight scenes. Jet Li I felt was wasted, as you cannot see his martial arts moves very well the way his scenes were shot. And unfortunately he was treated as the comic relief! The rest were basically cameos. Dolph Ludgren had an exciting car chase scene which ended in fights with Li and Stallone. Randy Couture and Steve Austin had a great fight scene towards the end. Stallone, Willis and another (uncredited) superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger had a short scene together, which too bad is not really key to the plot. Mickey Rourke's part is not really necessary and had no action whatsoever.<br/><br/>You certainly get what you expect here with ""The Expendables."" This movie is alive and kicking when there are action scenes. These are very well-choreographed, exciting, and very highly explosive, be it a car chase, assault, rescue mission. My only beef about the fight scenes is that they were shot too close-up and edited so fast. You do not know who is fighting who in a lot of scenes with many people. You cannot appreciate more the fighting technique employed. However, whenever there would be talk scenes, these were boring and inconsequential, fast-forward material.<br/><br/>Action fans will enjoy the action scenes very much. They are excitingly filmed, most the time. You could overlook that these are too incredible really. That final rescue sequence was non-stop slam bang action, as big flames and loud gunshots and explosions were continually in the face and ears of the audience. People who watch this film should not expect anything more intellectual or fancy with this film. They go in for the action alone, and they would definitely not be disappointed."
"Ryan_MYeah","7","3","8","27 August 2010"," It's a star packed, action packed, and utterly ridiculous movie... and I love it!
","OH MY GOD! THIS WAS LIKE THE GREATEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!<br/><br/>Okay, my first comment isn't accurate, but the one accurate thing I think CAN be said about The Expendables, is that it's a pretty fun guilty pleasure movie. In fact, guilty pleasure really doesn't give the film enough credit.<br/><br/>The film is written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, who also stars in the film as Barney Ross, the head of a team of mercenaries, comprised of other skilled men such as Lee Christmas (Played by Jason Statham), Ying Yang (Jet Li), and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews). They are hired by a mysterious man named Mister Church (Played by Bruce Willis in an awesome cameo) to travel to South America, and overthrow a power hungry dictator. But once there, they try to protect his daughter as well, and later find out that this mission also involves a ruthless crime lord named James Munroe (Played by Eric Roberts).<br/><br/>The story is kind of secondary to the real star that is the action,, a little predictable, but it's still pretty engaging that we're able to have fun with, and enjoy the dialogue. The movie is very funny with the chemistry between its actors, and the interest is always pretty high.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is simply huge, and fun, featuring just about any major action movie star you could ask for. Stallone, Statham, Li, Crews, Dolph Lundgren, Steve Austin, and Randy Couture are a pretty impressive badass lineup, along with Eric Roberts, and Mickey Rourke in great supporting roles. and brilliant cameos by Bruce Willis, and 80's action movie LEGEND Arnold Schwarzenegger (Rocky Balboa, The Terminator, AND John McClane in the same frame together?! EPIC WIN!).<br/><br/>This is to say nothing of the action, which is overblown, over the top, and completely ridiculous... AND I LOVE IT! It's way too much fun, the sound design and mix is impressive, the stunt coordination is top notch, and the visuals are simply killer. Thumbs way up.<br/><br/>My only real complaint is that I wish the film would have given Schwarzenegger a chance to make a brilliant one liner, which he's undoubtedly the king of. Even an ""I'll be back."" or ""Hasta la Vista, baby!"" would have made my day.<br/><br/>Still, it's a highly passable summer action flick. Predictable, but never boring.<br/><br/>I give the Expendables **1/2 out of ****"

Stallone comes around the corner and shows me how wrong i should be...damn wrong...<br/><br/>he did it first with the third sequel of first blood (John Rambo) and now he fully blows everybody in the cinema away with THE EXPENDABLES. i mean, i am from Germany and in Germany nobody claps or cheers or stands up to celebrate a movie scene (nothing wrong with other pictures, it's just our mentality and culture not to do so) but during the expendables and i'm talking about the whole duration of the movie, the theater nearly exploded and totally freaked out with every ""one-liner"", explosion or violent killing and there's a lot of all of it! <br/><br/>S. Stallone as a director found his own way to do action movies old-school but don't let 'em look cheap or cheesy.and because of him, after 20 years of waiting, i was able to see one of my favored action legends on the real big screen: DOLPH LUNDGREN.this guy definitely deserves more leading roles!great performance, really great! but not only him, the whole cast is extraordinary and everybody gets his special scene or moment and minimum one ""one-liner"" to laugh out loud to.i don't want to tell you anything about the story because i probably had this fantastic experience without knowing much about it. in my opinion, the script let the characters come first and the story, which is for gods sake not too complicated, comes second and that was the right decision.<br/><br/>after this movie, the younger generation will know why these men once were kings of the genre!<br/><br/>my last words: do yourself a favor and see this movie if you're an action buff!!!thank you Mr. Stallone for having an awesome time at the movies!!! <br/><br/>i definitely watch it again and again and again...."

Great intro scene to the ""job"" with Bruce W. & Governor Arnold. It needed more story to help with the chaos and action the Expendables caused. So why did they name themselves the expendables??? Good chemistry with Sly, Jason & Jet and Mickey. Eric R. was a good Bad guy as the real heavy. Might make enough to do a sequel but it needs to have more story to get me interested.

"shanfan_14","8","3","8","16 August 2010"," Comedy at its most suspect
","I have read no reviews, professional or fan, that seem to get the wink-wink of this movie. This is not intended to be a ""real"" 80s action movie, but rather, an over-the-top self-parody which worked very well on that level.<br/><br/>The one-liners were hilarious, the situations so intentionally ludicrous as to make the violence more cartoonish than horrifying. The things that are done are impossible, outlandish, and the massively destructive team emerges unscathed. The ""surprise"" in the end underscores the wonderful ridiculousness. The numbers of casualties alone should have been an alert to the fact that this was supposed to be wildly exaggerated.<br/><br/>Stallone has no illusions about himself or the genre which vaulted him to heady heights, in the day. He has a tongue-in-cheek, self-deprecating sense of humor and this was so evident in the film that the cast might have been wearing t-shirts that said, ""We know, we know...but ain't it grand to do this again, no holds barred?"" Well, words to that effect. Most t-shirts wouldn't allow for the entire sentiment.<br/><br/>Anyway, I laughed heartily and enjoyed thoroughly. The so-called ""target audience""--supposedly middle-aged males trying to recapture something or other-- just didn't seem to have as much fun with it as I, a woman who normally passes on gratuitous violence. This was SO gratuitous that I immediately glommed onto the realization that, yeah, they get it and they're having fun with it. Why didn't anyone else?<br/><br/>Expected, delivered."

"Torpian","9","6","22","11 August 2010"," This is a Stallone film
","I keep reading reviews from people who claim this movie has no story and isn't as good as the recent A Team movie. Some reviewers have said there is no character development and you don't really care about anyone in the film. I beg to differ though. This film is about a group of mercenaries that are paid to do jobs that the government would rather not be associated with. The plot may not be as involved as Inception or The Usual Suspects, but this is a different genre to those films. If you were to hire this from a Video store, it would clearly be found in the Action isle. Stallone obviously understood this and decided to make an action movie for fans of the genre.<br/><br/>You will get your standard corny one liners, big explosions, body dismemberment, hundreds of bullets being fired and big muscles being flexed. What you may not expect to get though is some great chemistry between Statham and Stallone and another superb performance by Mickey Rourke. Jet Li is under utilized but the parts that he's in have some decent martial arts action. Dolph Lungren was surprisingly good and I kept wanting to see more about his character. Randy Couture is barely in it, as is Terry Crews.<br/><br/>The scene with Arnie and Bruce Willis is a dream for anyone brought up on action films from the 1980/90s. Stallone must enjoy watching Dexter, as he cast Julie Benz in Rambo 5 and now he has David Zayas in this film. For wrestling fans, Stone Cold looks like he's the biggest guy in the whole movie and he does a fantastic job as the henchman for Eric Roberts. On the topic of Eric Roberts, a lot of people said he'd make the film too corny - honestly though, he plays the part of the rogue CIA agent rather well. If I were to tighten the script at all, I'd put more work into his dialog and give his background story or motives more screen time. In Rambo 5 Stallone took the time to build the bad guy into a character you really wanted to see dead - I didn't have that desire as badly in this film unfortunately.<br/><br/>I've been waiting for this film for almost a year now and it didn't disappoint. I look forward to The Expendables next outing. 9/10"
"the_rattlesnake25","5","4","13","13 August 2010"," ""What's his problem?""
","Throw together five of the biggest action stars in Hollywood history, garnish with a little of the new breed, and serve up with a glass of freedom ($82 million refreshing gulps of freedom to be precise) and you have a film which harks back to the days of the 1980's action genre, where films were more concerned with the amount of explosives used and excessive body-count, rather than the story and the rest of those 'boring things.' Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) is the leader of the 'Expendables,' a group of mercenaries who take the jobs others wouldn't even dare considering; over-throwing a dictatorship, and battling Somalian pirates is simply part of their nine-to-five routine. Alongside Ross is Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), an expert with anything that contains a blade, Yin Yang (Jet Li) a martial arts specialist, Hail Caesar (Terry Crews) a heavy-weapons professional, Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) a Swedish sniper and Toll Road (Randy Couture) the team's demolitions expert. With Tool (Mickey Rourke), providing the jobs, arms and tattoos as a former member of the Expendables with his own demons in mind.<br/><br/>When the mysterious Mr Church (Bruce Willis) offers the dangerous job of overthrowing the island of Vilena's evil dictator General Garza (David Zayas) and removing his American partner (Eric Roberts) and his henchmen in the process (Steve Austin, Gary Daniels), Ross's former partner Trench (Schwarzenegger) stands aside to allow the Expendables to take on the almost suicidal mission. This in itself, is probably the films greatest scene with many cultural references to all three major movie stars careers and personal life's being thrown abound (""he just loves playing in the jungle, right?"" quips Schwarzenegger to Stallone). Once Ross takes the job, what follows is an explosive-driven finale which sees the Expendables attempt the impossible as they send five men on to the island to battle the General's cantankerous army of hundreds (or maybe even thousands...) against the American invasion.<br/><br/>'The Expendables' is essentially an 80's action movie. It contains the action stars of past present doing what they do/did best (Stallone attempts a flying armbar, Couture finds the perfect way to apply a bone-crunching kimura, and Steve Austin is characteristically inhuman), a typically weak and clichéd script that does contain a few cheesy gems among the stereotypical macho hype, and plenty (lots, and lots, and lots) of outbursts of aggressive, explosive violence from your typical machete decapitation to the more complex hand-held-semi-automatic-rocket-launcher-weapon-thing. The producers and Stallone have also chosen to employ two editors which is an uninspired choice, as the film constantly switches between the fast, freestyle, hand-held Bourne style of Paul Greengrass (in which very little can be seen or understood), to the normal 'stand back and admire' method of the static camera. While the use of close-ups are in full swing, as to capture the lack of emotion in a film of this magnitude, the audience want to see body-parts flying every which way Sunday, rather than the leathery skin of a old, and hard-working Sylvester Stallone.<br/><br/>This film isn't perfect, nor is it a terrible film which contains more testosterone than sense. It is worth watching alone, just for the scene involving the 'big three' which is its saving grace. Aside from that however, it is typical action-orientated fan-fare. Remove the stars and you could have simply renamed this 'Rambo 4.5' as it contains the same limb-splintering, unrealistic, yet somewhat invigorating blood-shed that, that Stallone vehicle contained."

But after the screening I was so impressed, it's not Inception but the story was pretty good not the best but again for what I was expecting it was amazing. You get the action you get your fight scenes, explosions, blood, etc and on top of that an engaging story. It revolves around these men (expendables) who do jobs for hire and in an attempt to plan a high paying gig, Barney Ross (Stallone) see's an opportunity to actually help people and save what soul he has left.

","Although it doesn't qualify as the high-minded, movie massacre that ""Rambo IV"" was, writer & director Sylvester Stallone's ballistic, high-octane, adrenalin-laced actioneer about mercenaries with hearts of gold delivers its thrills and chills like grenades in your face. A gnarly-looking Stallone assembles an ultra-elite group of combat veterans known as ""The Expendables."" This rugged quintet of mercenaries renovates a South American dictator's palace and wipes out his entire army. This enormously entertaining but thoroughly preposterous tough-guy tale boasts a constellation of legendary B-picture action stars. Clearly, Stallone still wields enough clout to attract Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Eric Roberts, Dolph Lungren, Steve Austin, Terry Crews, and Randy Couture, not to mention Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger in cameos, to appear in his movie. Lensed on location in Brazil, New Orleans, and Los Angeles, this brawny but unbelievable, R-rated shoot'em up plays like ""The Big Chill"" of action movies. Life in ""The Expendables"" is cheap. Bodies topple like raindrops in a storm of gunfire. Bullets splatter heads and atomize body parts. This cynical, hard-boiled thriller bristles with larger-than-life firefights, fistfights, and knife fights. Predictably, sentimentality ennobles our heroes. They behave like the whore with a heart of gold who gives it up for nothing. Far from being cold, heartless automatons, our bulletproof protagonists win both our sympathy and admiration. They live an unwritten code and banish those who abuse it. Looking as fit as he ever, Stallone sports a Van Dyke and lots of tattoos. Not only does Stallone act as the ringleader for these motley mercenaries, but he also wrote the screenplay as well as orchestrated the action sequences.<br/><br/>""The Expendables"" opens at night in the Gulf of Aiden near Somalia as Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone of ""Rocky Balboa"") leads his elite team of mercenaries to ransom hostages from a ship hijacked by ruthless pirates. The pirate leader (Amin Joseph of ""The Mist"") isn't satisfied with the $3-million ransom payment that our heroes deposit at his feet. Instead, he complains that the company that employs the hostages has taken far too much time to pay him off. Now, as our eponymous gunmen sight him in with their infrared laser scopes, he demands $5-million. Our heroes quibble about who shoots whom and then Gunnar (Dolph Lungren of ""Rocky 4"") jump-starts the action and obliterates the leader with his grenade launcher. Meanwhile, our heroes wipe out the pirates to the last man without harming the hostages. Lee Christmas (Jason Statham of the ""Transporter"" franchise), Yin Yang (Jet Li of ""Unleashed""), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews of ""Gamer""), and Toll Road (mixed martial artist Randy Couture of ""Redbelt"") watch in horror as Gunnar tries to hang a pirate. Yang deploys his steel-tipped boots to discourage Gunnar, and Barney plunges his automatic pistol into the nape of Gunnar's neck. Since Gunnar has broken their code, ""The Expendables"" kick him off the squad. Gunnar has acquired a meth habit that puts him at odds with our heroes. <br/><br/>After they get back home, Barney hears about an offer from an anonymous man, Mr. Church (Bruce Willis of ""Cop Out""), who wants to meet him at a church. Barney suspects the man is a C.I.A. agent. Mr. Church invites one of Barney's oldest competitors, Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger of ""Predator""), to listen to his offer. Church wants to topple a ruthless dictator on the South American island of Vilena. Naturally, Vilena is a fictional South American country. Anyway, he wants the man behind the dictator, James Munroe (Eric Roberts of ""The Specialist""), rubbed out with extreme prejudice. Munroe and General Garza (David Zayas of ""Bring out the Dead"") have been harvesting illegal narcotics since they toppled the previous head of state. Ironically, the person who opposes Garza with a passion, Sandra (Hispanic actress Giselle Itié), is his daughter. She serves as an escort for Barney and Lee when they arrive to reconnoiter the island. Barney and Lee fly into Vilena in a battered looking amphibious plane. They pose as wildlife conservation experts but they aren't around long before Garza's soldiers take an interest in their curiosity. Our heroes have to shoot their way off the island. Barney wants to take Sandra with them, but she refuses to leave. <br/><br/>Later, Barney explains to his team that the operation is a C.I.A. set-up that will probably result in their deaths because the agency cannot be trusted to punish its own. Barney recommends that they turn down the offer. Nevertheless, Barney changes his mind after he thinks about Sandra and her decision to remain in the most miserable place in the world. One of Barney's former mercenary pals, Tool (Mickey Rourke of ""Iron Man 2""), reminisces about an episode in Bosnia when he failed to save an innocent woman. He believes if he could have saved her life, he might have saved part of his own soul. Barney is so moved by Tool's memory as well as the memory of the defiant Sandra that he decides to fly back into an impossible situation and save her. Although Gunnar is no longer with them, the Expendables volunteer to the last man to join Barney. Instead of doing the impossible for a $5-million pay check, Barney and his men do it for nothing. Meanwhile, Munroe has Sandra arrested and tortured so that he can learn the identities of the men who invaded his island paradise. Our heroes return and all hell breaks loose, with blood and body parts flying like confetti.<br/><br/>No, ""The Expendables"" isn't cute, clever, or particularly literate. The dialogue shoves the plot forward without sounding like bumper sticker philosophy. The one line that really sticks out is uttered by Stallone's character when Trench turns down the mission and heads for the front door. ""What's his problem,"" Church asks. ""He wants to be president,"" Barney scoffs. They don't have the usual planning scenes with maps and miniatures of the location. Nevertheless, this supercharged macho melodrama will rattle your cage like a blast from the past!"

Mr. Church offers 5 million dollars and Barney travels with his partner Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) in their plane to Vilena to meet their local contact, Sandra (Giselle Itié). <br/><br/>They have an incident with one troop and they flee from the island, but Sandra refuses to leave her country and is left behind.

The greatest attraction is the participation of the actors of this genre, come of them like Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger in cameo only.<br/><br/>I have not seen this film until today based on the boycott promoted by Brazilian citizens based on the derogatory and impolite comments of Sylvester Stallone about my city, Rio de Janeiro. Further, he left unpaid debts in my city, including in O2 Filmes that belongs to Fernando Meirelles. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Os Mercenários"" (""The Mercenaries"")"
"kluseba","7","3","9","25 August 2012"," You really get what you should expect
","The Expandables is a action super movie that puts together some of the most famous genre actors of the last decades. The movie exactly delivers what fans might expect. That's why you should not expect profound dialogues, too many romantic moments or a truly original story line. This movie is about cool quotes, many explosive action scenes and a quite fast paced and simple story line. Anybody who doesn't accept this kind of nostalgic and relatively simple genre should just not watch it and stop bashing this movie as you clearly know what you will get.<br/><br/>There are many cool one liners and funny hints, homages and references to classic vintage movies or characters of the genre. A good example is the scene when Sylverster Stallone meets Arnold Schwarzenegger as well as Bruce Willis in a church. When I went to the cinema, the whole crowd was laughing out loud during this scene and almost anybody understood the quite famous inside jokes in this movie. It was not the only funny moment in this fast paced movie and it was definitely better than many immature and though overambitious comedy flicks from Hollywood. I was even positively surprised by the many amusing moments that created a solid balance to the brutal action scenes without making the whole thing childish or ridiculous. The movie just managed to be humorous and cool at the same time.<br/><br/>The acting is of course not very deep or challenging but the characters fit very well to the different actors and you really feel that some of them go as far as to personalize their roles. Especially Dolph Lundgren, Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham shine in this movie and even have some sort of depth. The minor roles involving actors like Mickey Rourke or Bruce Willis are more superficial but fit very well and are clearly orientated on similar characters they have played before. These roles are made to appear as cool, experienced and male as possible and that's what you get.<br/><br/>The fighting and action scenes are varied enough to keep you addicted to this movie until the end. While Jet Li or Jason Statham really show that they are quite flexible and know their martial arts skills, Randy Couture or Dolph Lundgren represent a less aesthetic and more brutal and pitiless fighting style involving different explosives and guns. From time to time, there are even some experimental and original sequences where the characters don't only use their male force but also their brains to find a way out of a difficult situation. Some scenes are on the other side completely overloaded, especially towards the end as every few seconds, one switches from one character to the other and observes a pitiless massacre. Of course, this is neither profound, nor original but in contrast with the humorous parts, the whole thing turns out to work surprisingly well.<br/><br/>Concerning the story line, it's probably useless to say that the whole movie is pure fiction and quite predictable from the beginning to the end by dealing with the usual stereotypes. Of course, the leader of the wolf pack falls in love with a local beauty. It's quite clear that a traitor appears quite soon in the rows of the heroes that confronts his old friends. It's not surprising that there is some sort of a conspiracy and manipulation story around the main villain. You may quickly realize that the main villain is probably not as bad as it seems and has to face the demons of his past as one of his most important family members tries to fight him. The ending of the story is probably what you've expected from the beginning on. This is clearly the weakest part of the movie but the solid acting, the great actions scenes and especially the cool and humorous moments pardon for these obvious flaws.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie is recommended to all those that are into the action genre and like at least a couple or even all of the involved main actors. The humorous scenes could please to a larger public, though, for example when the guys bring their girlfriends to the cinema that only expect one hour and a half of raw male brutality. Apart of this humorous factor, you really get what you should expect. Take it if you like the actors and their kind of movies or just leave it and don't watch it because this movie won't make you fall in love with the genre. It's a truly entertaining flick but clearly far from being a modern milestone as it copies way too much the elements we already know but on the other side it's this rude simplicity that gives the film a rather classic, honest and sympathetic image."
"swedzin","5","3","9","11 September 2011"," Just a vision of one selfish man...
","This film... is one... big... circus act! And Sylvester Stallone, the director and leading star of this film is one selfish, arrogant, dumb, retarded, relentless a-hole. This guy is unbelievable! He is just impossible! After Rocky 6 and Rambo 4... Jesus... this guy needs to hit a retirement right now, or even years before. Stallone goes totally insane. He is someone who gives people false promises to make a good action film. And he made a promise to make an action film in 2010, that looks like a classic 80s action film. Well, first of all you can't do that? Why? Because 80s were long gone! If you want to make a 80s action film, build a time machine and go back to 80s! And I say, let's do it! Because Stallone obviously lives in the 80s, or early 90s, in his head, the guy's nuts! 80s classic film, huh? Cell phones here? Not very popular in 80s.<br/><br/>Now, the script, the plot... is just pure nonsense! The 80s films had good scripts and they had a meaning! The plot is pretty fast here. Just giving you an action and bunch of action character from 80s and 90s.<br/><br/>Now, that's a circus show. We got Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Li, Rourke and new additions as Crews and Corture. And we also got cameo of Bruce Willis and good old Arnie. That's just to show the good old three action kings in the film. Boring! <br/><br/>The only thing I liked about this film was Bruce Willis. He looked great and he was cool. And I am keep asking myself... why Sly and Arnie didn't perform oral sex on each other? Really, I'd say cool film if that happened! <br/><br/>Now, it's very stupid and unthinkable to put all those famous action stars in the film. I mean, what do you want? A film, or a damn bomb?! That's disgusting to see all those people here... Jet Li, who was funny, Lundgren who was really slow, and nothing else to do! Rourke? Jesus Christ, look at him! Michael Jackson's got a new replacement! Rourke was terrible. Nothing but sitting around and talking in his gravel, monotone voice with Stallone and of course Stallone talks in his retarded mumbling... Crews and Corture were new to this, of course Crews is one big, muscular guy and Corture is a former UFC champion, so they would be a fine addition to the film... for the love of... moving on! <br/><br/>Now, Stallone wanted also to put Steven Seagal, Van Damme, Wesley Snipes, Jackie Chan and some other actors in this film. Hell, why didn't you resurrect Bruce Lee while you were at it? Why didn't you bring Chuck Norris? Because Chuck would cure Stallone's retarded mumbling and then kill him! What a Hell? Action was fast, bloody and gory... 80s were not like that. That's only in Stallone's mind that every action film needs to be full of blood or gore. Who says so? Did you see Rambo 4? That bloody nut house? I rest my case...<br/><br/>The villains here... Eric Roberts as a villain? He was just evil and that's it. Remember those good 80s villains. Old Rambo films had good villains, remember Bennett from Commando (1985)? Remember Arnie or Lundgren as Terminator and Ivan Drago, remember Robert Patrick as T1000? Remember Steven Seagal was once skinny and handsome? But, no! Here we get a guy who has no style, no charisma, nothing special, just walking around and being evil. And he also had Gary Daniels and Stone Cold Steve Austin as his personal bodyguards. Daniels is great, but Austin was there just to have a fight Corture! That was predictable! <br/><br/>So what you got here is a madness of a man who needs to go retire or better yet kill himself. Stallone, stop making movies, you were once great! But, now... Expendables 2 is coming... I rest my case again. Now, hate me, spit me... Go ahead! Only because I gave a facts about that crazy, selfish c--ksucker! And if you are that blind to see it, Stallone ruined 80s for us with this film! He ruined that old, good impression."
"dcobbimdb","10","3","9","28 December 2010"," Awesome movie!
","I kind of wish I would have saw this in the theater, but didn't turn out that way, as it is though I was able to watch it to where I could rewind and re-watch many of the good scenes in this movie which added a little more than the theatrical aspect actually, and there's very few movies which you can say that about...<br/><br/>Sly was great of course and I've really grown to love admire him as an actor / body builder, especially at his age. I've always been a fan and although he had a rocky (no pun intended) middle carrier, I've thought his most recent stuff has been inspiring to say the least. Granted Jason was slightly more the ""main"" character along side Stallone in this movie and the other supporting cast was great as well. I loved so many of the scenes all in all.<br/><br/>To critique the film the only issues I had was it was a little too picture perfect in that no ""real"" bad happens. Meaning none of the good guys actually bite it and all of the bad ones do. Now I don't know that it would have made for a better movie perhaps if one or two of the good guys had gotten knocked off, but at least two of the crew were lesser known actors who could have easily got laid off shall we say. I certainly hope Sly make a second movie as there are plenty of opportunities.<br/><br/>Regarding Jet Lee, this was an interesting case in that I very much enjoy his movies over the years and think he's quite the bad ass, yet this movie put him and his size in place in which he wasn't superior or above the rest, and equally a credit to Dolph at the same time I suppose who I haven't seen much from in quite some time.<br/><br/>Overall a great movie and I very much enjoyed it. A total guys movie for sure and with many great actors and of course the cameos from Arnold & Bruce. I hope to see more!"
"unknown07","1","3","9","26 November 2010"," A mountain of CRAP
","This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The previews made it seem like a good action movie, but this is about as far from good as you can get. Stallone looks weird, Dolf Lundgren looks creepy, Eric Roberts seems to have brain damage, Mickey Rourke is simply a freak, and Jason Statham again plays the same character he did in The Transporter, Crank, and every other movie he has ever been in.<br/><br/>These actors from the 80's ALL SUCK. Schwarzenegger makes every line a joke, and Bruce Willis is ridiculous. This has nothing to do with the age of these actors. It has to do with the fact that THEY ALL SUCK. That's why people stopped going to their movies in the first place. For example, Stallone made Rocky, then about 50 crappy movies until First Blood, then about 20 crappy movies until Rambo, and then never made a good movie again. People can only take so much crap. This movie is the last time anyone is ever going to give these losers from the 80's another shot. <br/><br/>Stallone cannot direct, his lines aren't funny, no one in this movie can act, and nothing in this movie makes sense. I couldn't understand what they were saying most of the time. Who the hell is Mickey Rourke supposed to be? WHAT is he supposed to be? Who would hire this group of unprofessional weirdos? Who were Arnold Terminator and Bruce Willis supposed to be? Willis just swore a lot and Schwarzenegger walks in, says some serious lines that makes anyone watching the movie laugh at his moronic delivery, and that's it. <br/><br/>Stallone has screwed the public again, and hopefully for the last time. Screw you Stallone. If you don't know how to make a good movie, don't make anything at all. This is worse than Cobra. Now that's an insult."
"Elswet","9","3","9","30 August 2010"," We really had fun.
","Was it cheesy? Yes. Was it nostalgic? Yes. But it never takes itself too seriously. There are some really nice one-liners, and a lot of reminiscing about the good old days (presumably the 1980's), but Micky Roarke manages a very nice serious scene which attempts to speak for the overall tonality of these types of films and the American audience's thirst for them. I found it completely enjoyable; cheesy without outright camp; an ultra-violent flick with no gratuitous sex to speak of; fun, funny, and ... did I mention fun? <br/><br/>On the whole this is an actioner with enough camaraderie to make you wish you were there and with enough explosions and casual violence to make you glad you aren't.<br/><br/>There is (surprisingly) a plot. Yes, there are holes big enough to drive a Schwarzenegger through, but there IS as plot. It remains simple enough so as not to lose the avid fans of these films, but complex enough to engage the average movie goer. <br/><br/>Typically, those who seem to be the most disappointed by this film are the newer generations who really had no idea what to expect from these guys, or the avid fans for whom nothing would have been enough. I am a casual fan of actioners, so for me, this was great fun. <br/><br/>This film delivers performances we expect from these seasoned pros, a better than expected story, and super hot action. <br/><br/>We really had fun.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"poolandrews","7","3","9","29 August 2010"," Part old school, part modern noisy action blockbuster.
","The Expendables starts as Barney Ross (co-writer & director Sylvester Stallone), the leader & brains behind a gang of mercenaries, is hired by a Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) to overthrow General Garza (David Zayas) the vicious drug growing & trafficking dictator of the Island of Vilena in South America. Ross assembles his team, from weapons to explosive to martial arts experts who are highly trained. On a scouting mission to Vilena Ross meets local island girl Sandra (Giselle Itié) who puts her own life at risk to help Ross escape, moved by the act of bravery the mission becomes personal for Ross as he wants to help Sandra & the locals who live in fear of General Garza & his men but it seems the real enemy lies closer to home as General Gaza is controlled & used by an ex-CIA agent named James Munroe (Eric Roberts) for his own ends...<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Sylvester Stallone who also starred in the thing I'm guessing that The Expendables is meant as some sort of homage to the over the top action films of the 80' & 90's that many of the cast appeared in including Stallone & while not entirely successful anyone who holds that type of film in high regard & long for the days of the likes of Die Hard (1988), Cliffhanger (1993) & True Lies (1994) to name but three then The Expendables will satisfy your need for violence, big guns, cool weapons & huge explosions. The script is typical 80' action fare with almost superhuman action heroes taking on entire armies & winning while blowing lots of things up the process, maybe I'm easily pleased but I really don't see anything wrong with that all! The actual story & character's are less impressive, with so many recognisable faces in the cast it was going to be impossible to give everyone sizable roles & only really Stallone & Statham get any sort of character development. The plot is a little weak, again US Government agencies turn out to be the real villains but not much time is devoted to the plot. At a little under one hour & forty minutes long the pace is good even though there are one or two moments that it does drag but the final third is none stop shoot-outs, fights, explosions & death defying action set-pieces so all is not lost & there's plenty to look forward to as you sit through one or two of the slower moments.<br/><br/>There hasn't been a film like The Expendables for ages & it's great to see an action film that uses proper stunt-men, proper explosions rather than CGI computer effects although there still is CGI here. From a cool plane with front mounted guns that Statham sticks his head out of to aim to huge knives to massive guns that literally blow people apart The expendables is quite macho & any guy looking for senseless action & violence is onto a winner. There's also a great car chase with a really cool looking black truck & numerous fights. While Stallone & Statham get sizable roles Jet Li is disappointingly left behind somewhat & he never really gets to show off his martial arts skills which surely is a waste of a great athlete & talent. Dolph Lundgren gives an odd performance as a junkie & it's great to see him & Li fight it out with contrasting styles. A word of warning though, The Expendables is very violence with a lot of knife play including slashed throats, chopped off hands & one straight through a bad guy's neck in gory detail while the bad guy's are also literally blown to bits with some serious fire power but in my book that's a definite plus.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 no expense has been spared with the action set-pieces from exploding palaces that collapse to armies of bad guy's shot down to some great locations in Rio de Janeiro. The cast is brilliant, from Stallone & Statham & Li (The Expendables is the third film that Statham & Li have starred in together after The One (2001) & War (2007)) to Lundgren & Eric Roberts to Steve Austin & Gary Daniels to Terry Crewes & Mickey Rourke to the cameos from Bruce Willis & Arnold Schwarzenegger. If only that had managed to get Chuck Norris, Steven Seagal & Jean-Claude Van Damme the entire 80's & 90's action star roster would have been here. I can dream I suppose.<br/><br/>The Expendables is a throwback to the old school action flicks of the 80's & 90's while some modern filmmaking annoyances creep in occasionally like CGI, quick cut editing & shaky hand-held camcorder photography they are few & far between. I liked it for what it is & I loved the cast & the huge explosions & weapons on show, so sue me."
"quinnox-1","6","3","9","23 August 2010"," Meets expectations but could have been better
","The Expendables is a decent summer action movie, and a lot things blow up real good as expected. But it doesn't do anything that great and is really just an average action movie. It is far behind this summers best action move - Salt - and I'm baffled at how it has an IMDb rating that is much higher. This movie demonstrates that all our favorite action heroes of yesteryear have grown old, and the only one who is a modern action star of note in the movie is Jason Statham. He seemed a bit subdued in this movie and I would have rather seen him in an action movie that he starred in by himself, instead of this ensemble of washed up action stars. However, if you are feeling nostalgic and want to see long scenes with a lot of gunfire and explosions, this movie delivers in that respect."
"MBunge","7","3","9","23 August 2010"," Lots of booms but no boobs
","This cartoonish combo platter of action stars from the last three decades blows stuff up real goodand that's almost all you can ask of something like this, isn't it?<br/><br/>Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his right hand man Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) head up a mercenary band made up of predictably colorful characters named Ying Yang (Jet Li), Toll Road (Randy Couture), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and the normally named but abnormally huge Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren). After saving a ship from some Somali pirates, Barney and company are hired to kill a geographically dubious dictator. General Garza (David Zayas) is styled like a Central American strongman, yet lords over a Caribbean-style island in the Gulf of Mexico.<br/><br/>Barney and Christmas head to the island and check it out, where they meet Garza's daughter Sandra (Giselle Itie). She's sort of a cross between rebel leader and Nicole Richie. Sandra is captured by the evil ex-CIA agent (Eric Roberts) who is the power behind Garza's throne, leading Barney and company to storm the island and free her with a combination of mixed martial arts, bullets and a ludicrously unlimited supply of explosives. Assed are kicked. Bodies are blown apart. Stuff is set on fire. The bad guy gets the hell killed out of him in the end.<br/><br/>The 80s action movie is one of the more maligned modern genres and The Expendables is a good reminder of why that is. It's all fairly dumb, unsophisticated and macho almost, but not quite, to the point of being homoerotic. When the punches and knives are flying; when Stallone is pretending to be the fastest gun on Earth; when Randy Couture and Steve Austin hook up in the ultimate UFC vs. WWE battle; basically anytime a good guy is doing something extremely violent to a bad guy, The Expendables is also fun. There's a way too long lull between the opening action sequence and when things finally get going on Garza's island and the quality of one-liners in the script is pretty bad, but The Expendables is a solid B as 80s action flicks go and gets bumped up to B+ for putting a bunch of genre legends on screen at the same time.<br/><br/>There are a few things in this film I really don't understand. There's a scene that explains Couture's cauliflower ears and another where Li complains about being short that seem like inside jokes where I'm on the outside. I also can't figure out why Charisma Carpenter is in this film. She plays Lee Christmas' girlfriend and that role exists just to give Statham a little more screen time, but it doesn't make sense for that role to be played by a 40 year old actress who doesn't take her clothes off. Don't get me wrong. Carpenter is the personification of Milfy goodness, but I don't know why such a slight and mechanical part didn't go to some 20something babe who was willing to get nude.<br/><br/>In fact, there are no naked chicks at all in The Expendables. Not even a gratuitous scene where somebody goes to a strip club. I really don't get the point of making a testosterone-fueled festival of violence without having a few chicks take their tops off. While it's true that nudity was more the province of 1980s horror movies than 80s action flicks, this is 2010 and a bare boob or two is the least this film could have given us.<br/><br/>The reality of The Expendables isn't nearly as good as the idea of it. That reality is good enough to make this something all action fans, 80s variety or otherwise, should see."
"Ironwarrior86","6","3","9","23 August 2010"," Good concept but some things were missing...........
","It's certainly interesting to see a corrupted member of the C.I.A as one the main antagonists along with a few Americans including Gunnar Jensen who was part of The Expendables at the start of the film but is kicked out due to his wreck less behaviour and would later join the side of James Munroe (CIA agent) and the Brutal Dictator General Garza who James Munroe is controlling and keeping in power to make the people in Vilena (Fictional Island set in the Gulf Of Mexico)fear him for his own selfish goals and the main plot is to free the island from James Munroe . Personally I felt there was not really enough insight into The Elite Mercenary Force (The Expendables); things just kept happening and it was only really later in the film I even began to catch on to what it was about. I know all the characters had names but at times I didn't catch them. Another thing I could not understand was the scene with Church, Trench and Ross; did they really need to get Arnold Schwarzenegger (Trench) and Bruce Willis (Church) for a role that was so brief? Really Church offered The Expendables the mission of overthrowing a brutal dictator and then what; we don't see or hear from him after? And the plot between Lee Christmas and Lacy; what was that about? No impact on the plot and you don't even think about Lacy after you see her for the final time on the motorbike when Lee wins her over... In addition just once I'd like to see a film where the shooting combat is believable; name me one elite soldier that can keep throwing enemies to the ground in real life without getting shot by a nearby enemy? I'm all for action films but I've seen too much unbelievable shoot 'em ups already.<br/><br/>Anyway moving away from that I think I should discuss what I found to be good. The acting was quite good and the actors did suit their roles; the best acting of all was undoubtedly from Mickey Rourke (Tool) while making a revelation to Ross ( Sylvester Stallone) about his experience in the Bosnian War to Ross which was definitely among one of the most emotional scenes I've seen in a long time. We really needed to see more of that guy in this film. The plot itself is nicely done but quite hard to understand at first<br/><br/>Here's a list of some of the things I enjoyed and didn't enjoy. <br/><br/>WARNING :DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS BECAUSE SOME OF THESE ARE SPOILERS<br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/>If you're into pure action this is for you.<br/><br/>The Plot is very enjoyable if you can follow and understand it. <br/><br/>The Main Antagonists are very interesting and it's well thought out how General Garza ultimately gets fed up with James Munroe and no longer wants his help as he realises how little he cared about his people and no longer wants to be manipulated. <br/><br/>Does a good job of showing that General Garza cares for his daughter Sandra despite his initial cruelty to his people. <br/><br/>Action flows well and some scenes had tense moments <br/><br/>Some Emotional Scenes especially the one with Tool are well done.<br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/>When James Munroe kills General Garza for turning against him we don't even get to see any emotion from Sandra; it certainly could have been a very nice emotional scene as the General was her father and they had finally made peace briefly before he was killed. So we never find out how she felt about it and it's almost like it didn't happen. <br/><br/>Not much insight into The Expendables Mercenary Force which was definitely a real let down. <br/><br/>Can be quite hard to catch the names of some characters and to be honest I had to watch the film a couple of times to get the names; was I the only one?<br/><br/>Some events in the film were almost forgettable and didn't need to be there as they never affected the plot.<br/><br/>We never hear from Church again; he doesn't even show up to congratulate the team on their success.<br/><br/>Plot can be difficult to get into at first.<br/><br/>Combat seemed a bit unrealistic. Does every action film have to have people capable of superhuman feats? Don't mind lack of realism in films but unrealistic combat is just too common now. This might or mightn't be a good thing; it really depends on your own preferences.<br/><br/>Some characters needed to be developed better because some felt like empty shells."
"ajs-10","6","3","9","21 August 2010"," Great action sequences but ultimately disappointing.
","As a male of the species I am not averse to the odd action movie, they're (usually) not too taxing on the brain, there's lots of explosions, and, if we're lucky, there's a pretty girl to be rescued. Well, 'The Expendables' ticks all those boxes and more. With cameo's from both Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger this was one I really wasn't gonna miss. But here's a bit about the plot before I tell you my thoughts.<br/><br/>The Expendables are a group of mercenaries led by Barney Ross who are hired by a Mr Church to assassinate the dictator of the small island state of Vilena. Whilst staking out the job, Ross and his associate, Lee Christmas, meet a rebel leader called Sandra, who just happens to be the daughter of the island's dictator, General Garza. Just to add a bit more to the mix, the General is being helped by a rogue CIA agent, James Munroe, ably assisted by his henchman, Paine. The two men leave the island in a hail of bullets leaving Sandra behind. She is captured and tortured by Munroe but The Expendables are on their way to the rescue. There is a lot more to the plot, but I don't want to give too much away.<br/><br/>The action sequences were all very well done and very gory. There were plenty of explosions and stunts that, again, were all very nicely pulled off. I guess the thing that let this film down the most was the dialogue. It seemed to get a bit bogged down at times when you just want them to get on with the action. And the final third of the film has plenty of that! Decent performances though from all of the major cast, so honourable mentions go to Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Jet Li as Ying Yang, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, Eric Roberts as James Munroe, Randy Couture as Toll Road, Steve Austin as Paine, David Zayas as General Garza and Giselle Itié as Sandra.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up slightly disappointed. Even a decent soundtrack, ending with 'The Boys are Back in Town' by Thin Lizzy couldn't make up for its lack of depth. Stallone has produced some great films in the past but unfortunately this one just falls short of the mark. I feel I'm being a little generous with my score, but the action sequences were very good and I can't forget that. So, if you like a lot of explosions, a damsel in distress and a crack mercenary team coming to the rescue, then this one is most definitely recommended. Otherwise maybe not.<br/><br/>My score: 5.8/10"
"Guy177","6","3","9","21 August 2010"," A movie that leaves you ecstatic but worried in a good way despite minor clichés
","Very minor spoilers ahead!!! Mr. Stallone went to same University as my mom and was told he could not act. How wrong those people were.It's hard to please everybody. I had to force my index finger to click 2 stars down because of it's naturally confusing nature, necessary clichés, and predictable moments. Take away those and you have a movie that dives deep into concepts rarely talked about or performed: Certain types of stereotypes and philosophy for example. While Mr. Stallone is well known for Rocky movies he takes on a similar but VERY DIFFERENT role in this particular film. Bernie (Stallone) and his group of mercenaries have been given the assignment of assassinating a dictator. In terms of political accuracy given modern terrorism this does not seem accurate to many well-studied history and political students such as myself. However, the moral destructiveness that has engulfed many well-off countries even in a time of economic hardship is slightly hinted at through the moral struggles of these mercenaries. An unoriginal cliché pulls itself to fame through the art of how the story or hero gets there. Bernie Ross (Stallone's character) is so like us as user Sir_Cellophane_Beak from Aukland points out in his review: ""The audience falls in love with Bernie Ross because he is scared of the unknown just like us. What makes him a hero is his conviction and spirit, which makes him embark on a nationwide journey for the search of love and faith."" It shows in the symbolism and multiple personalities of the four or possibly five main characters and one important side character. Gunner is the loose cannon and a threat. ""Tool"" is a somewhat stereotypical Marine and is used somewhat sparely in the film. He seems to have a interesting knowledge of medicine and guns which gets linked together in a way that is somewhat hysterical. Yin Yang is also used sparingly though not to the extent ""Tool"" is. He seems to be the stereotypical Asian (good at fighting and he has an accent to boot). Lee is competing with Bernie and has similar problems to him as well. Another character who does tattoos is like Obi-Wan of the group. His mini lecture(s) make you think-despite having a slang type wording. It's a nonstop action movie with an intense cliché romance that is so powerful and forbidden that it only takes a few short scenes to make you realize that Bernie cares about this girl for more than her ""hot body"". She makes him wonder where he should be drawing the line when it comes to his moral integrity and it moves the story so well that it's over before it started. The fact that it's literally shorter than you would expect doesn't hurt either. A few over- the-top clichés, some historical/political inaccuracy, and a funny but still unnecessary cameo by Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger can not stop me from telling all IMDb users to see this movie. Film may be a business as Toy Story 3's ""tear jerking story"" proves but that doesn't make this movie or Stallone's message any weaker; not by a long shot. <br/><br/>P.S. Unlike Shamaylan's awful choreography in the trailers of Last Airbender this movie's is more up to par although still slightly annoying in terms of having the eyes to catch certain punches or kicks. The camera also focuses unnecessarily but rarely on certain details. This is a reference to the review of user Guilherme Diniz who claimed the choreography was just awful, it was often unfunny, and the plot was a mess. He only mentions one plot flaw and it isn't a plot flaw but rather an issue he has with a minor sub-plot. Nobody said it was a comedy.The jokes are enough to make you chuckle rather than whole- heartedly laugh-out-loud and the plot will make ENOUGH sense to those of us who need the simplest of plots. See the movie and decide for yourself. Perhaps it is just a Sex and the City but for Men. In other words, maybe it is just a movie for over 60% of U.S. guys the way women like Sex and the City (since we guys don't understand according to one user's review which I personally agree with. Why do they watch that?)."

","Very entertaining cult action movie...<br/><br/>I really don't know what else people expect (besides action!) when going to see a movie that boasts the heaviest line-up of action movie stars spanning the last few decades...? Sure, you would expect there to be a plot that holds the movie together and characters (which this movie has a lot of!) that you can buy into and cheer all the way to the end. This movie has those things and while the plot isn't the most original, (which is a very difficult thing to do nowadays within the action genre as it's limited by concepts based on reality unlike science fiction) the film has ingredients that gives you an ensemble of action that feels quite quite original although it's not! It's rare that I go to an action movie and get so many ""whoahh!"" moments, either the action looks too cheesy (slickly choreographed) or it uses too much CGI and looks too.. cheesy!! Well, this movie as many of you already know doesn't use any CGI, as (props to the aging cast!) they do ALL of their own stunts, and a couple of them are quite spectacular! The fight scenes are technically, probably not very realistic, with unflinchingly accurateknife-throwing, displays of almost super-human strength with limbsbeing severed and a ratio of deaths even the ""300"" Spartans would beproud of! But it's not meant to be. It's not a war film like ""Saving Private Ryan"" that leaves you sentimental and sobering, it's meant to be a larger than life action movie that entertains and dazzles and gives you a bit of an adrenaline rush, which it does in abundance.<br/><br/>All the main cast obviously have action movie careers and statuses that they want to protect, so I thought it'd be a bit risky putting so many stars that are exclusive to this one genre alongside each other in a movie. Having said that, somehow each of the actors were given enough airtime to enhance their individual careers, showing a bit of what they could do for the ones not so familiar to the moviescreen and more of what they can do for the more established.<br/><br/>OK, I think I've said enough without saying that much. If you watch action movies like anything from ""Rambo"" to ""Bourne"" or even ""Manga"" films and don't have a personal dislike for any of the cast or a nagging desire to find plot holes in movies, especially the heavily anticipated ones, you WILL really enjoy this movie!!!"
"MarcusJ13","8","3","9","20 August 2010"," One liners, explosions. THE EXPENDABLES!!!
","The Expendables brings the old action clichés and aims to celebrate them as much as possible and what on Earth is wrong with that? It is easy to say this but sometimes you do just have to sit back and enjoy the onslaught of violence. I mean with a cast of Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Jason Statham, cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnie. It gives action fans exactly what they want and lets the world know there is testosterone in the movie world after all. How does the plot play, well it involves the team heading preparing to overthrow a dictator. With Sylvester Stallone at the helm naturally he heads the group and therein lies a sort of problem. Stallone leads alongside Jason Statham mostly meaning we don't get the team fighting together as much as we'd like now usually that wouldn't be a problem as we can get more time for some form of character development. Well as much as an action film like this one will allow. The thing is I wouldn't have minded an onslaught of the entire team in combat but we don't get that as much as we would like. Regardless it is a hugely enjoyable film for action fans. The key word there people is ACTION fans, you are not going to get something thought provoking as it knows what it is supposed to do. In spite of my mild complaints about the amount of time on screen some characters get it isn't bad and allows it to build tension and come into its own and is just a joy to watch. Do we get the moments of humour we all like in films like this? Of course, do we get the implausibility where it is extremely difficult to get hurt? Of course. Possibly the aspect I appreciated the most about this film is that they did not hold back in the action and go for the lower rating, again it is giving the action fans what they want. Alright there is the shaky cam but is it still enjoyable getting past that factor? Yes it is because at least there isn't the slow motion holding up things. The characters are likable for the most part as well and you don't really need to be hit over the head in order to root for them. <br/><br/>To conclude The Expendables works well to the best degree that the usual clichéd action movies that remind us mostly of the 'good old days' where we would make a manly salute in appreciation of action by the bucket load. Just sit back, relax and realise it won't be making a sweep at the Oscars."
"searchanddestroy-1","Null","3","9","18 August 2010"," A very expendable film
","I already knew what I was going to watch before the beginning. But I am disappointed by this feature. I won't see it again. Never. it's a sort of homage to action movies from the eighties, with actors from the eighties: Stallone, Rourke, Lundgren, Schwarzennegger, Willis - even with cameo appearances for the two latest, and also actors from the nineties and 2000's: Li, Statham, Austin...<br/><br/>I would say it is a pyrotechnics flick: explosions, useless talk, clichés seen a thousand of times before, especially twenty years ago. No really outstanding sequences, except perhaps the one with Stallone, Schwarzy and Willis. And Rourke's character is touching,as a former soldier of fortune tortured in his soul.<br/><br/>It's not a boring film, although.

For some reason people seem to be raving about this movie, the blood was overly animated the jokes and references were as corny as ever, and the acting was alright. I do have to give props to all the actors for all the awesome hand to hand combat (especially Mr. Statham) At best this movie is a rent. It was exactly what i thought it would be.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","6","24","13 August 2010"," Great Action That Lives Up to the Hype
","Expendables, The (2010) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>There's no question this here was the most anticipated action film in quite sometime due to all the legends of the 80s teaming back up. If you're looking for some sort of heartfelt or dramatic story then you can pretty much look elsewhere but if you just want mindless action then Stallone has delivered yet another good one. The limited story focuses on a group known as the Expendables who go on secret missions to kick as much ass as possible. This time they're paid to go to a small island where a drug lord (Eric Roberts) has taken over the military and killing innocent people who try to fight his ways. Stallone, Jason Stratham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Terry Crews and Mickey Rourke round out the good guys with Steven Austin playing the sidekick to Roberts. As the trailers have ruined, we even get Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger in a brief scene with Stallone. Again, if you're looking for some sort of drama then just forget about it but if you like action then you're not going to be disappointed here. I think you can't blame the story for being somewhat one note because they had to find a way to put all these famous names in one movie and that's really not as easy as some might think. All of these personalities need their space and each of them get it with the countless action scenes. I was really surprised by Roberts since he hasn't been mentioned in any of the trailers but he delivers the good as makes for a terrific villain and there wasn't any problem loving to hate the guy. Austin also made for a great villain and his fight with Stallone certainly lived up to the hype. As for the rest of the film, it's simply a lot of fun. We are treated to some terrific, over-the-top and extremely violent action scenes with one of the best coming when Stallone and Stratham take off in a plane and decide to go back and treat the bad guys to a little action. The scene is a very memorable one as is the final giant battle, which lasts a good fifteen-minutes with God knows how many dead bodies and bullets flying around. We even get some very good, smaller action scenes including one where Stratham goes after a man who punched his ex-girlfriend. This is one of the scenes where Stallone lets each actor do their thing and it makes for a good time. The now somewhat legendary teaming of the big three from the 80s only lasts for about four-minutes but it lives up to the hype. We get a few good one-liners and it was just a nice thrill seeing all three together even if this was one of the few scenes without anyone getting hurt or killed. There are a few major problems with the film with the biggest being some extremely bad CGI effects including an embarrassing one where a building gets blown up and eventually falls down. This sequence is so fake looking that it almost takes you out of the film. I'm sure some might be disappointed that not everyone gets equal time on screen but I think Stallone did the best he could getting so many people into the film. Fans of the 80s action are going to have a good time with this one but you really shouldn't take it too serious. Everything here is just meant for fun and on that level it works."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","5","19","12 August 2010"," Know what to expect, and don't think that all the legends get equal screen-time
","Too many chefs spoil the meal. Or something like that. Assembling a group this size of legends in this kind of movie runs that risk. It doesn't fall in that trap... instead, only Sly(one has to wonder why he and Arnie didn't appear together before this... I guess they were too big rivals? Anyway, the Austrian and Willis are hardly in this) and Statham are in this more than a little(the rest are in this at the beginning and end... Carpenter isn't in this much, either). Li doesn't engage in a lot of martial arts(and a mere single fight), Couture just about none, other than taking out goons. Lundgren is cool as usual, in a role of reasonable size. Eric Roberts is perfect as the villain we love to hate. Austin has reasonable presence, and they get good mileage out of him. The acting isn't impressive. Humor mostly tries too hard(with that said, some of it is excellent), especially the forced banter that is meant to make us feel like these guys really know each other. The dialog is corny and clichéd with few exceptions. This is stereotyped all the way, but that's about what would be expected. On the whole, this is like the recent Rambo; a pure, no-holding-back, dirty, bloody, gory 80's action(with that said, it gets to be increasingly disorienting and chaotic when it grows grand in scope... and not all of it works) flick. We've got car-chases, shooting, knifing and huge explosions, and a ton of it(if there are gaps between them, and they can be awkward). Stallone(who remains a dependable, if not flawless director for this sort of picture) tries to have his cake and eat it too, the people on the island are not the enemy, which is nice, but still the native soldiers are gunned down by the boatload. The plot is odd and confusingly poorly told. A small island called Vilena has problems with its government. Mainly because of a rogue CIA agent. The Expendables are hired to take care of it. They go about this by causing carnage wherever they can. This uses classic rock for the score, which is a great and fitting choice. One last thing... are the character names a joke? A dare? Seriously. There is plenty of brutal violence, disturbing content and moderately frequent strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone looking for this kind of thing. The testosterone is through the roof on this one. 7/10"

"Rodrigo_Amaro","10","2","5","3 May 2012"," Better late than never!
","The church meeting scene is something action fans all over the world waited for many years to see happening on the screen. Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Willis together in a moment from the same film, something that should have happen a long time ago, way back in the 1990's when they were at the top of their game as the greatest action heroes of the period. It took a long time to get here, to get this brief encounter made reality but better late than never.<br/><br/>Made almost with the same extravagance of the 1980's action flicks but not with the same greatness and effectiveness, ""The Expandables"" recycles an heavy clichéd plot about good mercenaries taking down from the power a corrupt and tyrannic dictator of a South America country supported by a CIA agent (Eric Roberts) and his malign plans. But the appeal here is seeing the group's member, the so-called Expendables: Stallone joins Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Mickey Rourke, the last one playing a friend of the team but retired from all the action. Now, the other side is composed by Steve Austin, Gary Daniels (but you can't barely see his face) and a few others. Willis and Schwarzenegger are merely cameos but there's no problem in that, they're part of our fun in watching the movie. And it wouldn't be a complete work without a girl to help those guys, the dictator's daughter, played by Gisele Itiê.<br/><br/>Theme and plot are quite similar to many others developed in action films made since the 1980's up until now, but without causing some of the everlasting impact some of those movies caused on us, specially when it comes to the action scenes. Let's face it: the heroes are the same but the Hollywood system has changed a lot in order to get bigger audiences and to do that they get a little bit drenched with a politically correct agenda avoiding problems with the final product and editing/censorship issues. With that I mean that ""The Expendables"" is quite controlled in terms of violence, Stallone doesn't make of this such a visceral and heavy thing like ""John Rambo"" was, where half of the villains had their body parts flying around shattered by knives and machine guns. Good thing to some, but the movie isn't so memorable for the action sequences (they're good,being the most impactant the first guy killed in the movie, he simply disappeared after one shot fired) but it stays in the memory because of its use of humor. Gotta admire the priceless moment with Statham reciting a poetry in a bar, or Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren fights, or Li wanting to get more money for his work because he needs to pay for the school of his alleged kids.<br/><br/>It's a helluva movie, proving that action heroes never lose their style while in combat and they never get old (only their faces). The dream became true, not the way we wanted but at least it wasn't a nightmare, got some wonderful results with audiences and critics, the sequel is on the way and I can't wait to see it. 10/10"

","In a year of three groups of manly men getting together and being manly, I must say I'm surprised that this came second to The A Team. It was a wonderful throwback to the 80's, but failed to match any of them in awesomeness. Luckily we get enough testosterone, violence, and bad oneliners to really keep us chuckling. Lundgren was the star for me, the only one really hamming up the 80's ness of it all, with lines such as ""INSECT"". Only Statham and Stallone get a decent amount of screen time, and too much emphasis is put on their relationships with women. But when it was good it was great (airplane pier explosion scene, Lundgren vs. Li) and when it was bad, it was still fricking entertaining (""Next time I'll deflate all your balls!). It's easy to pick it apart and declare what we wanted it to be, because there was so much pressure to deliver.

It is a story of a small tactical mercenary unit that are down to earth about the gravity of their assignments and best of all about this film, there is no obvious hero, there is a leader but there is no obvious hero who will save the day.

First the choices of actors are phenomenal, and the actors that were asked and didn't do the movie ""to bad so sad"". i'm sure it hurts when actors turn down great rolls.<br/><br/>First I want to speak about the chemistry between Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham. The two action film stars were able to play off each other well and they seemed like they new each others work really well. I found myself smiling at the dialogue between the two through the whole movie. I would love to see these two do a movie again soon.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Eric Roberts and he didn't disappoint me as he played James Munroe a dirty CIA Agent. I like the way he plays a bad guy but he doesn't look or act like the bad guy but make him mad and he will definitely show you how bad he is.<br/><br/>Seeing the cameo appearances of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis was nice. It was nice because I know that they did it for their friend. It was a Sylvester Stallone movie and Schwarzenegger and Willis may have just did as favor but the rolls that they played made their mark in the movie. They left the movie open for a new direction and I loved that, All involved including Li, Lundgren, Coutoure, Austin, Rourk and Daniles left their mark that I wouldn't mind seeing the developing characters.<br/><br/>Adrienne Noble"
"TonyHurtado","4","2","5","5 December 2010"," The Expendables, is worth every penny.
","Let me just say this first, any movie with Bruce Willis from (Die Hard) Sylvester Stallone from (Rambo) and Arnold Schwarzenegger from (The Terminator) all in one room means that this will not be no frickin pussy movie. This movie was no stop action, and when I say that I mean there was not one moment of the film that did not have action.<br/><br/>You know I really thought this movie would not do good be good because there were to many well known actors but it turned out to be one great Summer action flick. Also on one particular note, this was Terry Crews' best film in my eyes, because he has been in some bullshit Tyler Perry crap but I think after this film he is going to get some great props for his role.<br/><br/>Also another plus for me was that this film had the best UFC fighter, Randy Couture, and one of the best WWE wrestlers Stone Cold Steve Austin in one film. I got a kick out of this when they both went at it, it was WWE v.s. UFC basically. Two other things I like was that Jason Statham and Jet Li were friends and not foes, because of one of their previous films ""WAR"". The second was that Sylvester Stallone was teammates with Dolph Lungren, because they were also foes in another film Rocky VI.<br/><br/>This movie was a great film mixed with allot of action, adventure, suspense, thrills, and laughs. I was also impressed that Sylvester Stallone did a great job directing this film, and staring in it at the same time. I also give him props that he finished the movie after breaking his neck in one scene where Steve Austin had to push him into a wall, so props to Sylvester for accomplishing all this at once in just one frickin movie, I would give this film a 8 and star review."
"inflamator","8","2","5","24 October 2010"," I liked it, but it could be better
","The movie was great. All of 'em are my idols and none is, that i'd dislike. Comparing to some other reviews - Schwarzenegger could have more to do. But I suppose, that he wanted too much cash, and it stopped at one scene role. I didn't know, that Seagal and Van Damme was proposed to cast in the movie, but it's a pity, that they refused. I'd like to watch it with 'em too. Spoiler ! - A pity is for the Jet Li, but not for the poor dialog, as one reviewed, but for the director to let him loose with Lundgren. Jet Li should've won :D What I like about this movie, that it's not focused on one or two characters, but it says something about every one of them. What I like most are fighting scenes. I don't care if they were sped up, or something. They're just awesome. Specially Statham on Basketball court (my favorite scene and actor) ! :D Eight out of ten, because though I liked it very much, I was hoping even better, but it's just great."
"amraampk","8","2","5","15 September 2010"," my all time favorite action cheetah family together
","I had been waiting for this film from long period and watched it twice in theater.The film really packs a good action punch. Watching Stallone along with Statham , Li, Lundgren , Rourke, and with Willis, Austin and especially Schwarzennegger was a marvelous experience. As an action lover if you want something adrenalin pumping fighting movie with a huge cast then this is the film for you. The most fascinating moment for me was watching sly with Arnie first time in so many years. In 1980s i was a boy , those were the best times of my life and in those years these 2 folks were at their prime , were my most favorites. But there was also slight disappointment as Arnold did only a cameo with Sylvester , it would had been great if he also had kicked some ass. However i found plot some little weak, it could had been some better. although i here give sly credit for assembling a big heavy cast , he somehow on occasions lost his grip on movie moments. Well he tired to hire Van Damme, Snipes, Kurt Russell , and Seagal but they turned down due to some personal reasons. But if the action and cast is concerned i believe he made a tremendous job by putting all together and making a big action flick. It might have disappointed some people but in my opinion that they expected too much of it which it failed to deliver , but to me regardless it wasn't an utter failure anyway whatever. I found Jason Stathem as most dominating among all of them. some moments are quite enjoyable of this movie and it can be a good experience."

","An group of elite mercenaries (Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture and Terry Crews), they called themselves ""The Expandables"". They are men for hire to get the job done at any means necessary. When an mysterious man, who calls himself Mr. Church (Uncredited Cameo by Bruce Willis) hires ""The Expandables"" to overthrow an brutal dictator (David Zayas) in the gulf of Mexico but the real target is ex-CIA agent James Munroe (Eric Roberts) as well for his two henchman's (Steve Austin and Gary Daniels). Meanwhile, ""The Expandables"" gets help from an mysterious woman (Gisele Itié), who is their contact for the mission.<br/><br/>Directed by Sylvester Stallone (Rocky 4, Rocky Balboa, Rambo) made an fun, old-school action movie of the 1980's. This is certainly an Big Budget ""B"" movie with plenty of action, explosions and humour. The cast seems to be having an great time, although some of the supporting characters are thinly written. Mickey Rourke does appear in a small part as an former teammate of ""The Expandables"". Charisma Carpenter from ""Buffy:The Vampire Slayer"" TV Series has an small part as well. There's not much story to tell but the movie is very entertaining and it helps forget the small flaws to just enjoy the mindless action. Fans of action movies of the 1980's will certainly have an blast. Arnold Schwarzenegger appears uncredited in an amusing cameo. Screenplay by the lead actor/director and David Callaham (Doom, Horsemen, Tell Tale). Super 35. (****/*****)."
"abhisheksep","5","2","5","9 September 2010"," Movie did not precede with its title, it is not expendable for both time and money.
","The Expendables, title of the movie is surely heavy. However star cast like Jason Statham,Jet LI,Lundgren,Couture,Steve Austin,Mickey Rourke and Sylvester Stallone makes it heavier... but the plot,screenplay,characterization and overall ""The Content"" of the movie could live upto its reputation??? Here lies a big question !!! And the answer to this is NO. Movie did not precede with its title, it is not expendable for both time and money.<br/><br/>10 mercenaries were hired and headed to Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia to overthrow a dictator.Head Character Sylvester and Jason reach the island to scout out their opposition and found a rebel Spanish girl named Sandra and discover the true nature of the conflict engulfing the city. When they escape the island and Sandra stays behind, Sylvester must choose to either walk away and save his own life - or attempt a suicidal rescue mission that might just save his soul. this is the plot of the movie. <br/><br/>Just as a typical Action genre movie, it starts at loud note and looks very promising. But as the movie passes by it start losing its grip because of weak screenplay.Old school dialogues were used most of the time.The weakest part in the movie is its characterization. Jason Stathon looks grumpy and lean,mickey Rourke just a waste of talent, Dolph Lundgren a big and heavy weighed man looks like a Dumb fellow with mere mental problems and the most disappointing actor in the movie is JET LI. He looks dull,old & lethargic in his both speech and body language.He was pale in his expressions,uneasy in his dialogue delivery and gave cold action moves. I missed his fast speed Kung fu where nobody can stand in front of him rather he was used as a mocking part in the movie where everyone mocks at him because of his short height.Sylvester even used Arnold and Bruce wills as special appearance to give big names to the movie but it ain't worked.<br/><br/>Only Sylvester did a pretty good work in acting the role of the Director of the film. As an actor he failed too,throughout the movie he had a single expression on his face. Its just the direction of Stallone which holds you till the end.The direction of photography is fine.Jeffrey Kimball took the shots accurately keeping the camera stable in long shot action sequences.Some action scenes were commendable specially that sequenced Sylvester and Jason escape from the Island and comes back in their flight while attacking the dockyard and stylishly exploding it. It was truly mesmerizing and memorable! Even end action sequence was quite loud and long but still engaging to watch. But on the whole, the movie can't be considered good just with Action content in it. It needs to have 'Heart and Soul' and a script which is not only thrilling but also contain dramatic and emotional feel of the movie with live characters in it. At last all I can say is-""Sylvester used big names and production value in the movie as copy ""PASTE' but it was a total 'WASTE'.<br/><br/>My rating- 5/10"
"freemantle_uk","7","2","5","8 September 2010"," A bloody enjoyable film
","Sylvester Stallone had a major comeback when he wrote and directed Rocky Balboa and Rambo, both being popular hits. With his career back on track he set out to make pretty much the ultimate action film with a cast of 80s, 90s and 00s action stars like Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts. The Expendables is set out to be a deliberate throwback to the 80s and is a unashameably enjoyable.<br/><br/>After rescuing a ship crew from Somali pirates, Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team of mercenaries are offered a tough mission to assassin a military dictator of a small island by Mr. Church (Bruce Willis). When exploring the island with Lee Christmas (Statham) the team believe the mission is a suicide mission to kill a rogue CIA agent James Munroe (Roberts). But when their contact Sandra (Gisele Itie) is captured Barney feels compelled to save her. His team, Christmas, Yin Yang (Li), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and Toll Road (Randy Couture) go to save the woman and complete the mission.<br/><br/>The Expendables does have problems: some of the acting is bad, particularly Itie and David Zayas who are both wooden, terrible dialogue and plot was a minor inconvenience. But The Expendables was never set out to be a Shakespeare: 80s films are not known for being heavy on plot. Stallone is a skilled action director and with The Expendables there were many delicious sequences, from fall blown gun battles to material arts fights. Many moments are over-the-top, like the use of plane and the final battle scene: but that is part of the fun. The film is very violence and enjoyable: Stallone does not hold back but I don't know why The Expendables got a 15 rating in the UK but Rambo was an 18. Both were as violence as each other.<br/><br/>The film felt like that it had 80 minutes of material and that Stallone had to find way to stretch it: such as the fight seen between Lee Christmas and a group of men at a basketball court and the chase scene in the city. Many of the characters lack depth, with moments involving Christmas and his girlfriend (Charisma Carpenter) felt forced and we do not really understand why Barney gets a conscience to go to save a woman. There are moments of humour which are fun, but some other moments were funny when Stallone set it out to be serious.<br/><br/>The Expendables sets out what it is meant to do: be an old-skool actioneer. It is a fun filled action film, with a lot of blood and a great film for men to watch together."
"Corky1984","Null","2","5","3 September 2010"," Provides a welcome care home for 80s action stars
","There was a lot of hype before this film and that's hardly surprising given the stunning cast list. Stallone, Statham, Li, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Rourke, Lundgren...the list goes on. OK, so a few of those big names were only cameos, but so what? The first scene in cinema history featuring Sly, Arnie and Bruce was full of in-jokes and set the rest of the film up nicely. The plot was a run-of-the-mill nasty general/CIA rogue get taken down by a team of hotshot mercenaries, but that's fine by me. The film had plenty of old-school action and didn't take itself too seriously. There were some great laughs to be had from the interplay between Stallone and his co-stars, especially Statham. Stallone himself is showing his age a tad, with plenty of veins and stretched skin making him look much older than his co-stars, but there's no doubt that he can still hold his own on screen. I would have preferred a full-blown 18 rating, to match Rambo IV's excellent levels of carnage and mindless violence, but there was still a good dose of firepower on display. They could easily make a sequel, ideally with Schwarzenegger taking on a proper role once he's finished playing politics."

","Would you like to see three of Planet Hollywood's former owners gather around in one scene? Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone make a brief reunion in thiz ultimate action movie. Stallone brings all the brawny heroes into one action package, not just the legendary ones like Mickey Rourke and Dolph Lundgren but also across generations with solid performances from Jason Statham, Steve Austin, Randy Couture and even martial arts superstar, Jet Li. Stallone who is also the Director in thiz movie, puts all of them into one battle pool. Every one of them has their own characteristic and you can see the sparkle between their interactions. Stallone gives a precise mentor performance. Although Jet Li involves into awful choreographed fight, but he delivers some fresh and effective humor. Dolph Lundgren shows how good he is with his bad boy attitude. But still, the best performance belongs to the bald Jason Statham with his cool and unmerciful expression. The story is way too simple and it feels like the plots is only a vessel for their own playground. It's what 1980s action heroes always do. Is thiz outdated? Not completely. The battle scenes still meets today's demand which is gory and brutal. For everyone of us who are action movie fans, I'm pretty sure that we have been waiting for thiz kind of classic stuff, where the dialogue is brainless but it looks cool, where only one guy can beat all the bad guys but it still looks awesome, and finally there is always a scene where the action hero has to jump out from a mega explosion behind him as an ending. It is simply a classic! But it still rocks our world. Mr. Stallone, you remind us of what we just need! By the way, do you realize what does it take to become a great action icon? Beside firm muscular body and some die-hard stunts? Well, pay attention to the specific characteristic of how the way they talk. Stallone (Italia), Schwarzenegger (Austria), Lundgren (Sweden), Jet Li (China) and Statham (England). To become a solid action icon, you will also need a unique speaking accent! <br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

","The selling point of the film, The Expendables is the iconic cast itself. Stallone, Willis, Schwarzenegger and company bring their star power to this otherwise average action film. The storyline does not offer many surprises. This is still a good versus bad guys film with a lot of firefights in between. There parts and scenes in the film that could have been shortened or removed with little effect on the finished product. Schwarzenegger's cameo is really an end unto itself. The whole point of the scene being his appearance. Also, Mickey Rourke is given a role that is inconsequential, which is quite unfortunate, since Rourke is very much a fine actor. This in turn brings up another shortcoming of this film. Audiences are used to seeing this collection of stars in lead roles. They carry their films. In The Expendables, they are almost reduced to being bit players. What this film has going for it, are highly entertaining action sequences and doses of self-deprecating humor that can only be delivered by actors who have reached the heights of stardom. By watching this film, you really get what can be expected of a Stallone film, an emphasis on the visual rather than on dialogue and complexity of plot. Setting aside expectations of a memorable screenplay, anyone viewing The Expendables can still find it worthwhile to see."
"GrantReedIII","6","2","5","30 August 2010"," It was pretty much as expected.
","First off, this was an action movie, nothing more nothing less. As such it was what I was expecting.<br/><br/>I guess the big thing was that it brought together a lot of action stars from past decades. That may have been one of its problems. There were a lot of stars, and not enough time to give those stars appropriate screen time.<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger and Willis made an appearance that had absolutely no action and was just as obviously to include them in the movie. If it marks them, returning to movies, that's fine, but for the most part it just affects six-degrees stats. The same might be said of Rourke's appearance. He had very little to contribute to the action, and was there to provide a weak excuse for Stallone's character to risk the second part of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie seemed to focus on the characters Ross and Christmas (played by Stallone and Statham). What little plot it had seemed to revolve around them and they were the only ones with a ""romantic interest"" in the entire film. They also seemed to have the most screen time.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed with Lundgren's part. He came across as just a dumb jock, rather than a burned out mercenary. He may have been picked to come across as not overly bright, but it actually seems to me as if he was miscast. cast.<br/><br/>Jet Li, though he had a lot of dialogue, was underused. He had some decent action, but he seemed to be too much of a whiner. A friend of mine, who watched the movie with me, said he had never seen Jet Li get beaten up so many times in a single movie.<br/><br/>Couture and Austin actually did a decent job. The lines weren't there, but the action was. Both of them had great fight scenes.<br/><br/>Terry Crews came across as a brighter Jayne (Reference: Firefly/Serenity). He had a few decent lines but little impact on the storyline. <br/><br/>One of the cool aspects of the movie was the hand-to-hand fighting. These fight scenes were relatively well choreographed and were very old-school. No wires, good fighting, use of environment (where applicable), and a certain amount of realism (meaning, yes, people actually get hurt).<br/><br/>As far as the rest of the movie; lots of explosions, very little plot development, actresses were only for show (neither one was a strong character), lots of gun fire, oh yeah and lots of explosions.<br/><br/>It's a weak movie, but a moderately good action flick. It's not the best action movie of the summer, but if you go in, knowing what you were going in for, it's not a bad hour-and-a-half, or so."
"mystery_guy-1","6","2","5","26 August 2010"," Just what you expected, so it's really predictable but entertaining.....
","I'll give this film 6.5 out of 10, I expected this movie to be bad ass, ass kickin', elicit and kindle film since it's an all star cast or more like the dream team for action movie cast. The first half was pretty cool, After seeing bloody scenes against those pirates and the the 2 men vs hundredths of soldiers, I've said to myself ""This is what I've been expecting."" But then I ask myself again, what comes next? I've predicted that they will kick the asses of all the army, And yeah, they did. I've predicted that no Gunnar is still alive, And yeah, he's alive. I've predicted that no one in the expendables army is gonna die, And yeah, they're all alive. Statham's life was predictable. Pretty much everything was predictable. The only thing that I was proved wrong was the one that defeated Paine. Never thought that Toll will finish him.<br/><br/>It was a pretty good action movie but the drama needs a little work. I think Stallone should have make the army looks more dreadful and evil, Like what he did in Rambo. I even think that Rambo was better.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a decent film. It tried its best to keep all the characters rolling. But like what I've said, It was pretty predictable."

","Well first thing I enjoyed this movie but I have to say that both of my friends who I went with did not recognise a few of the stars. Randy Couture and Gary Daniels (who is wasted) and also I had to explain Steve Austins credentials.<br/><br/>There is homage paid to everything from Rambo to cobra in this movie as well as a little joke for Arnold and you know the surname. Essentially a mercenary team who do what mercenaries do for money, the leader decides to save a girl who he falls for and you can work out the rest of the movie from there. I still love the way that Dolph Lundgren is portrayed as a meat-head but has a degree in engineering (I think) an amazing IQ and was also captain of his nations Karate Team (I know he is at least a 2nd Dan now, please somebody correct me if I am wrong). My main and only problems with this movie are observations that my friend made<br/><br/>Nobody got seriously injured (for the expendables) and the camera angles for the hand to hand combat scenes were all over the place.<br/><br/>I have to agree the guys in this movie do not need silly camera angles to look good. A good movie overall but definitely for the action and martial art geek like me who know all of their film stars."

","I am a huge fan of the good old action movies of the 80's like Commando and ever since I heard that Stallone is doing the ""Ocean's 11 of action movies"" I had been waiting for this movie and boy did it deliver. There really weren't many things I didn't like. I liked Randy Couture's monologue and Terry Crews turned out to be the perfect fit for his role as well.<br/><br/>Hopefully they will make a sequel as there are still some old school movie badasses around that we want to see. Seagal, Snipes & Van Damme for example.<br/><br/>It was a hugely entertaining thrillride of explosions and machismo and I recommend it heartily."
"Jerique","8","3","10","24 August 2010"," Violent!
","I'm going to agree with Stallone when he told Jean-Claude Van Damme that this movie is violent. Smack Shoot Em' Up and Sin City's violence together and throw in a wacky storyline of save-the-girl campaign and you got The Expendables.<br/><br/>I've never seen such a violent action film. You watch a movie like Salt or Knight and Day and you think, ""awesome action packed movie."" Not the case here. The Expendables has substance in the plot, and the action is off the charts...but quite honestly horrific in some aspects. Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) is a knife expert and he doesn't just kill people by stabbing them. When Christmas kills, he throws the knife into their neck and the blood gushes out and flows like a canal.<br/><br/>Barney Ross (Stallone) has a violent streak too, sometimes he uses knives and it's grotesque. Sometimes he uses shotguns or his fists and pulverizes his opponents' face into nothingness. Or perhaps, he'll blow the dude's head off. It's extremely violent to say the least.<br/><br/>I'm not complaining in any way, but perhaps people who are used to the kind of action similar to Mission Impossible, Bourne Identity, and the like, will find this movie's action to be a little too much gore. If you have a weak stomach and you don't like the Saw films gory stuff, I'd suggest stay away from The Expendables.<br/><br/>I was quite disappointed that Schwarzenegger and Willis were only given approximately four minutes of screen time. I was hoping to see them in action, but I guess those days are gone, especially with Arnold being governor.<br/><br/>As a plot, the movie has barely anything. It has enough to get the movie started and the action rolling and keep coming. However, basically the first fifteen minutes of the movie set the tone for how the movie will play out. Basically, you get twenty minutes of drama and story and an hour and twenty minutes of action.<br/><br/>Special effects aren't bad either and it's quite an awesome flick if you can get passed the gore. All the characters are cool and all have a nice back story and development.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who can sit through an insurmountable amounts of gore. If you can't, then you probably won't like this movie very much. I cannot wait for The Expendables II. Should be just as great."
"thunder_tank","8","3","10","22 August 2010"," great action film
","I grew up in the 70's/80's and fondly remember all the action classics of that era. Also, bear in mind I own films that divert from the action genre by some degree, such as 'Gone With the Wind', so I can appreciate many other types of movies.<br/><br/>Before seeing the film, I read several reviews of it, and was feeling like I would be let down.<br/><br/>I was wrong. This film is one of the best action films I have seen, the plot is sufficient to deliver what is essentially the good guys wiping out the bad ones. Acting from Stallone/Statham is good and they work well together. Rest of the cast do a good job too, Lundgren has some classic one liners too! I don't understand the comments people make about the CG effects. To me they blended well and in the majority, didn't stand out like a sore thumb (like in most modern films).<br/><br/>If I have to make a negative comment, I think the shaky camera style was slightly overused but it didn't detract too much especially as the action was mostly fast paced.<br/><br/>Sometimes films are supposed to just be fun and not be taken too seriously, this is one of them. Watch it with this frame of mind and ignore the so called 'expert critics' that can't see this."
"MosHr","7","5","22","10 August 2010"," The boys are back in town. Must see for 80s action fans but not a masterpiece
","The expendables feels more than an action movie featuring lots of action stars and as such, the end-result more than the sum of what each individual action star brings to the movie. It feels like a high-school reunion and a philosophical musings of what it means to be an action star. It takes it's time to carve out the habitat, the conversations; the little cracks in their façade that makes us love and cheer our action heroes. This isn't in the James Bond action hero mold with lavishness and sex thrown around, nor is it the losers style music video inspired color splattered offering of style. It feels gritty with history seething out of every line and every interaction. The expendables gather in something like warehouse converted to a machine shop like it's the living room of an aging group of friends. It's the world of soldiers turned mercenaries competing in a small world of like-minded mercenaries like it's some kind of competitive sport.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's infuriatingly full of clichés. Tough as nails protagonist but with a heart of gold, South American dictator tied to the drug trade with rouge CIA agents. The script really drops the ball big towards the end and jumbles up a good buildup. The action scenes sometimes suffer from portions where it's a blur of arms, legs, gunshots and explosions and nothing really is visible.<br/><br/>So, all in all, it's a notable addition to the action genre. There are numerous explosions, high impact bullets that tear baddies apart and as you'd expect a good dose of hand to hand combat that some of the stars bring to the table. While the personalities and environment they create are truly awe inspiring, the story and lackluster finale really fizzles this out. However, in the end, the story which is bolted together from a staple of generic 80s non-offensive action plot devices is not the main attraction of the movie. It just provides a palette for all the actors to craft their art which is the highlight of the movie on which it delivers wonderfully."

Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) <br/><br/>I spend much of my film criticism time looking for quality films that I can praise and recommend; too often they're like Mademoiselle Chambon-- European and chatty. So how do I handle a guilty pleasure like Sylvester Stallone's action-overloaded Expendables? I advise, let yourself indulge, give yourself to the Rocky /Rambo retro-king, and enjoy the best cheesy pulp this summer 2010 (I know—The A-Team, Salt, and Knight and Day are the weak competition).<br/><br/>Barney Ross (Stallone), a fit and aging adventurer, signs with his buddies, including the lethal Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), to overthrow General Garza (David Zayas) and the CIA rogue James Munroe (Eric Roberts), drug lords from a minor island. Because of the involvement of Garza's beautiful and estranged daughter, Sandra (Giselle Itie), Ross is highly motivated—the result is mayhem on a small Michael Bay scale but far more entertaining.<br/><br/>Stallone is robust and sharp and Statham as Transporter-dangerous as ever. When they are flying their amphibious plane, the shots are so process-looking as to reinforce the idea that director Stallone is winking at the comic-book roots and our own recollection of pre-digital action poverty.<br/><br/>The brief scenes with Bruce Willis and the uncredited cameo by Arnie are just the right touches of nostalgia and sarcasm to remind how much we miss these iconic albeit aging heroes. In addition, Eric Roberts has never been oilier, and the drug business never as vulnerable.<br/><br/>But then, no drug lords could ever withstand Rocky and Rambo at the same time."
"freypal","10","3","11","19 August 2010"," Superb. A welcome return of real action
","I had high expectations for this film following all the hype and publicity and I was not disappointed. To sum it up, this film is fantastic.<br/><br/>I was concerned it may just be a no-story explosion filled picture but I need not have worried. There is a solid story and the cast really seem to bond. Sly and Statham seem to genuinely get on and are fantastic.<br/><br/>It has just the right amount of comedy and smart one liners. As many have said it is just like watching a classic 80's action film with all the benefits of modern cinema.<br/><br/>All I can say is... please please please Hollywood, take note. We need more films like this! 10/10 for me!"
"T_h_e_Punisher","10","3","11","19 August 2010"," Outstanding
","I can not understand any negative reviews for this movie. I can only assume critics who have slated this movie are simply not fans of the Action genre, because as an action movie it delivers like no other has before.<br/><br/>The action is non-stop and in the third part of the film goes in to overdrive. Excellent fight scenes, especially from the always reliable Statham.<br/><br/>OK, there are a couple of scenes where the banter falls a bit flat (the church scene with Willis and the Governator for one)but surely the difficulty in getting these big egos to appear in the first place out-weighs this.<br/><br/>Hats off to Stallone, he has still got what it takes and I can't wait to see what he can do in a sequel (Van Damme? Seagal?)."
"the-timelord-victorious","8","3","11","18 August 2010"," BrillIANT popcorn movie!
","This is without a doubt one of the cheesiest action films ever made. But my god, I love it. Stallone is brilliant, even though he can't act, but I don't care. I went to see this merely to be entertained. I didn't want a deep and meaningfully story line, nor did I want to be emotionally involved with any of the characters. If anyone wanted to be, then they would've been gravely disappointed. This is a perfect summer popcorn movie, and I wouldn't have wanted anything else from it, really. I loved the Arnie joke as well. I felt that was very well timed.<br/><br/>I thought the playful tension between Stallone and Arnies characters was a nice touch, also. Considering they were basically rivals in the 80's, made this a very amusing scene to watch. <br/><br/>The action was great, the acting was terrible, but I really feel that this was a nice throwback to the 80's. Nothing like a good action film. Overall, THE EXPENDABLES, I found to be, highly entertaining, CGI-lite and just bloody good fun."
"r-balaji-610","6","3","11","14 August 2010"," Awesome action, yet disappointing
","The Expendables is a heavy action movie taken in the 80s style with modern weaponry and lots of blood.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and seems fit for an action movie. The Expendables is a group of mercenaries led by Barney Ross(Sylvester Stallone). Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) hires them to overthrow the dictator of the island country Vilena. So, Ross and his men go to Vilena to execute their plan, assisted by a contact Sandra. In Vilena, their plan goes quite wrong and they escape the place while Sandra is taken hostage. Then Ross, feeling guilty returns along with his team to save the girl.<br/><br/>Hardcore action fans will love the movie for what it is. Lots of blood, lots of fire and lots of guns. Wrestling fans too will love the moves exhibited by ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin. But when stars like Jason Statham, Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren group together as a team and are led by someone like Sylvester Stallone, you expect something more than just what this movie presents. The Expendables would have probably been better if it didn't have such a star studded cast but relied on just Stallone alone. You might enjoy the powerful action in this movie, but in the end you'll feel that for such a huge cast, something is missing in the movie.<br/><br/>If you want to watch this movie, do so with your brains at home and also any expectations from the stars. You'll thoroughly enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the heavily hyped cameo scene between Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger was a complete disaster. It was the biggest disappointment of all."
"jford574-96-266746","10","2","6","18 August 2012"," An excellent movie
","Frankly, I am miffed by the negative reviews for this movie from movie critics who are so far removed from reality and the tastes of real people that any good review they write is more often than not the result of good luck. I am even more miffed by the people who took them seriously, and decided to let them influence their opinion of the movie. The Expendables is a movie with good dialouge, great acting, great action, and an interesting storyline. No, it does not deserve 10/10 (more like 8 or 8.5/10), but my exaggeration is based on the fact that the stars are so fantastic, that just them being all together raises the movie beyond its basic merits."

"leftwingmofo","5","2","6","4 January 2011"," A disappointing film that didn't know what it wanted to be.
","When I first became aware of The Expendables, I was certain that this was going to be the most fun I would have at the cinema in 2010. I bought into the hype, all right, thinking back on my childhood and the cream of the Eighties action crop. It was a time when men were men, women were barely there and more bullets were fired in two hours than in all of World War II. I went into the screening ready for a mix of cheese and awesomeness.<br/><br/>What I got was something far less. The Expendables has one major problem: it doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be. It seems Sylvester Stallone wasn't sure if he should make a balls to the wall Eighties action throwback or a serious examination of the effect war has on men who live for battle. In the end, he tried to make the movie both, and in trying to be both, it was neither. The much-vaunted all-star cast turned out to be largely wasted, with Stallone and Jason Statham taking up much of the running time, and in Statham's case half of that was an unnecessary subplot about his ex-girlfriend. If Stallone had decided to follow this side of the story properly - the impact of the job on personal relationships - instead of using it to seemingly pad out the running time, then maybe it wouldn't have seemed so contrived.<br/><br/>Of the rest of the cast, only Mickey Rourke leaves much of an impression. His one major scene, recounting an event in Bosnia, steals the show and left me wanting to learn his story, not that of the Expendables. The action is decent but many of the most mouth-watering set pieces, such as a fight between Dolph Lundgren and Jet Li, are poorly shot. Terry Crews gives us the most memorable action sequence of the movie when he decimates bad guys with an automatic shotgun, but the film is otherwise uninspired.<br/><br/>The Expendables is about as average a film as you can find - in fact, it's below average. It wasn't the best action film of the Summer, never mind of all time, as some might have you believe. If the cast wasn't full of big names, how would this have differed in any way from the straight-to-DVD action schlock that you can find in bargain bins everywhere? It's a wasted opportunity and one that is far from essential viewing."
"rwa-937-287667","4","2","6","30 December 2010"," Major letdown for 80's movie fan
","Saw this movie on Bluray and man was it bad. For an action movie it had 45 mins of plot, and not fun plot either a lot of explaining and jokes fell flat. And when the action finally starts its not directed well just shaky-cam shots of (literally) faceless guys dying.<br/><br/>I love cheesy action films, Commando is my all time favourite film of any genre, hey I even liked half past dead (look it up). Rambo 4 was awesome, but this sucks.<br/><br/>The stupid plot about south American dictator was bad, that whole thing was done so much better in Commando.<br/><br/>My 4 stars is for a handful of OK scenes, including a nice scene with a plane strafing and Terry Crews' explosive ammo, but those were in the trailer. I hoped this film would bring the 80's style back but alas I'll keep waiting and re-watching Commando, Predator and T2."
"Boloxxxi","5","2","6","13 November 2010"," You disrespecting me, man? As soon as I get my camera man and editor I'm gonna kick your ass.
","A group of mercenaries called ""The Expendables"" are hired by the CIA to take out a Latin dictator who's making his people's life hell. The mercenaries later figure out that the real target is a former CIA operative who is using bribery and intimidation (acting like a ""dictator behind the dictator"") to conduct illegal activities in the country.<br/><br/>My problem with this movie and many action movies in general are ""quick-cuts"" (and ""late-cuts""). Say what??? Okay. Editing. Since it is used to ""cut from"" and to ""cut to"" a scene, it's principal function and responsibility is CONTINUITY. Therefore if the cut is too soon or too late it disturbs continuity.<br/><br/>Editing, or ""cutting away from"" and ""cutting away to"" a scene can occur anywhere in a movie, but it is used in greater frequency in fight scenes and action scenes in general because a lot is happening in the moment. But is also used artistically or creatively to make an action scene look cool and/or to make you believe that something happened that might actually not have or could not have.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are what concern me. I'm a purist. I feel that too often they are aided by quick-cuts (the scene was not allowed to follow through). Basically, the editor helps the performer (even the ones in this movie that are supposed to know how to fight) with editing and camera work. The effect of which is a kind of ""slight of hand"" martial arts or fight scene.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the only way you can tell if someone really knows what they are doing is to use as few ""cut aways"" (and ""cut tos"") as possible during the action. This way you get a good look at their technique and have a sense of REAL continuity. This kind of ""quick cut"" and ""splice"" type of fighting in movies has sadly become the trend.<br/><br/>""What's your style?"" <br/><br/>""Crane-style"" kung-fu. What's yours?""<br/><br/>""Camera-editing"" style."" <br/><br/>""Never heard of it."" <br/><br/>""Well, whenever I get into a fight, I make sure my camera is set up and running. Then after the fight is over I run home and do some editing so that I come out on top. Sneaky style, ain't it?"" <br/><br/>""Yeah. It is."" <br/><br/>Love, Boloxxxi."
"JoaoPovoaMarinheiro","5","2","6","14 October 2010"," A no-brain action packed movie reminding the old days
","What can a luxurious cast filled with old and contemporary action stars can bring? <br/><br/>Well, what you expect actually. There's nothing much to say about this movie. A nice effort by renouncing computerized action and it assembles some of the action genre's biggest names. The plot is what you expect, a 'no-brain action-packed' movie, a perfect blockbuster for a Summer afternoon where you can turn out your brain for a bit.<br/><br/>Nothing more than a tribute to the old cheesy action films from the eighties with a top-notch Stallone, that keeps justifying his envious form for a sixty year-old as well as his longevity. That's it - 5/10."
"Shameless_in_the_shower","6","2","6","15 September 2010"," Adding negatives don't make a positive!
","I'm a big fan of action movies.<br/><br/>I grew up in the eighties where both Arnie and Stallone were a staple diet so naturally I was excited about the Expendables. After coming out of the Cinema I felt my heroes had let me down a bit.<br/><br/>I keep seeing the same type of postings as I did for Transformers 2 and other similar disappointing action films, all along the lines of ""What did you expect, this is all about the action baby"".<br/><br/>Errr, no not really. People don't watch Gladiator and say ""it's all about the swords and the tigers man"". No good film is all about action, there has to be some kind of emotional content to make the action count so that we actually care about what happens to the characters. Aside from caring about what happens to the careers of the legendary cast (which I do), I didn't really feel for anyone in this film nor care what the outcome was.<br/><br/>********************************** Spoiler Alert ************************************************<br/><br/>The side story about Stathams character and his girlfriend was more than welcome. A bit hammy maybe but more than welcome. In the context of the film, without other character side stories it seemed a bit random though. I think from seeing this Statham bit in the Trailer, I was disappointed not to have seen similar side stories on the other guys who seriously lacked screen time.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke was great as always. The (possibly improvised) banter with Statham about the tattoo on his head was great and the emotional scene about the woman on the bridge was nice but maybe just not quite enough to instigate Sly's character to revisit a South American island and fight an army to rescue a woman who he only met for 5 minutes. Mmmm The whole friendship thing, we're coming with you whether you like it or not. Didn't buy it! Maybe... a big argument, they go separate ways, then they all show up at the end and work together? Formulaic maybe but would have probably worked better I think (It needed a major rewrite in other words, probably not by me).<br/><br/>Some of the fight scenes were good although maybe a bit too close and frenetic, suffering from Transformers Syndrome. Some great one off moves but maybe a little too much phony CGI blood and guts as in the latest Rambo instalment (which was a better film).<br/><br/>The scene with Arnie, Sly and Willis Didn't work well. Willis doing his kind of Tarantinoesque B movie cameo could have worked but Sly and Arnie weren't there. Did Arnie not looked genuinely offended? The whole scene seemed completely contrived just to get the three together so they could put the names in the credits.<br/><br/>Back in the eighties I really believed that John Matrix would go through all he did to rescue his daughter. I was right there with Rocky to avenge Apollo's death from Ivan Drago. I even felt the glass on my feet when John Maclaine didn't have any other way to go. Was I with the Expendables? Nope. <br/><br/>Overall a Disappointment. The reason being, is that it could have been great. There could have been a lot of things said about friendship, warrior code, getting older in a young mans job. All sadly missed! <br/><br/>On the other hand, definitely worth a watch. That AA-12 Shotgun at the end is pretty cool!"
"Floated2","4","2","6","9 September 2010"," Somewhat entertaining but bad storyline
","The Expendables has somewhat a lot of action but it is lacking in storyline and a good plot. The movie retained the finest action figures one could only dream of putting together in one frame and that was exactly what Sylvester Stallone did. Watching Sylvester guiding a bunch of mercenaries was a joy in itself and that too action heroes like Jet Li, Jason Statham, Randy Couture and Terry Crews. Steve Austin maintains his dignity by beating up Sylvester Stallone but eventually ends up as a victim to Randy Couture. The acting was pretty bad and the script/ dialogue was also pretty disappointing. Their were some action and fight scenes towards the end but it was difficult to watch because of the shaky camera and it would switch directions very quickly.<br/><br/>Jason Statham manifested some great skills in there with his awesome fighting style. He was the best character in this. Jet Li augmented himself to the list of fighters by beating the hell out of the bad guys. Dolph Lundgren was asked to leave the group because of which he fires back at Sylvester and Jet Li but ends up getting shot ( not killed as he rejoins the team eventually ). Eric Roberts poses himself as the bad guy with Steve Austin watching his back every now and then. Terry Crews has one great scene where he comes out with his shotgun and goes on a rampage. It was a wasted opportunity for Willis and Swarzenneger. They were only seen in one scene and it was pretty fast. Also for a movie with this many action stars, it was only a little over 90 minutes. They should have focused more on a story and tale the film over 2 hours.<br/><br/>The Expendables tries to do too little with too much. It ticks a lot of the mandatory action genre boxes with its big bangs, slimy villains, one-liners and curiously named heroes, but provides a largely hollow and unengaging experience. Expendables? Disposables more like."

"amesmonde","Null","2","6","6 September 2010"," Nostalgic harking back to action heydays
","The Expendables is an old-school, kick-ass action movie, but for 2010. The fighting is rougher, the use of knives and shooting are bloodier and the explosions are bigger. What hasn't changed though is the awful dialogue, and true to 80's tradition the female characters are not given much to do.<br/><br/>Old Sly Stallone is never given enough credit, he's a nominated director, writer and actor. Compared to his other 80's counter parts you'd expect him to still be a huge bankable star, but that just hasn't been the case and he's seen career ups and downs. Following up the surprisingly great Rambo, Stallone is on slightly lesser form here, with an almost homage to the action flicks he starred in or went head to head with himself in the 80's.<br/><br/>There's lot to like about The Expendables, naturally there's lot of action set ups and some nice 'buddy' chemistry between Jason, Jet and Sly. Eric Roberts put's in a good performance and it's great to see him in a blockbuster. There's welcomed cameo's from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. This action has an array of old and new action stars including Dolph Lundgren and Steve Austin. The car Barney Ross (Stallone) drives is similar to the one in Cobra (1986) and there are some other nods in there.<br/><br/>For me Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) stands out the most, and while Mickey Rourke is given some meaty dialogue it seems too heavy for the theatrics of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Don't watch expecting anything spectacular or special, The Expendables is just R rated fun with a nostalgic cast that will leave you with a grin on your face."

","Recap: A team of mercenaries get recruited to overthrow a general that with the support of a rogue CIA-agent has taken a brutal control of a small island in the Mexican Gulf. A mission that they initially decline, but when the leader Ross take a personal interest in a woman that seems to be single-handedly fighting the oppressors the team decides to take action. And it promises to be a violent fight with neither side holding anything back.<br/><br/>Comment: The veterans of the genre still know how to do it. The cast, spearheaded by Stallone, Li, Statham, Lundgren, Rourke just to name a few, is perhaps the best an action movie has ever sported It is almost as impressive as the action offered by the story. As you can understand The Expendables is a high paced, action packed, violent and adrenaline filled movie that entertains from the first moment to the last. With a few inside jokes, some great cameos and a string of well delivered one liners this is and will be, in my opinion, a classic in the genre.<br/><br/>It starts out in a high pace, and excels by keeping it throughout the entire movie without any real or noticeable dips. But where it surprises most, is the well balanced, well written mix of characters. With the size of the cast there really is no time to explore and develop more than a few more extensively, but none of the seem like a cardboard character. Each and every one of them has at least a few unique characteristics that defines a spot for them on the roster. Ironically, none of them are expendable with concern to the story. All of the acting veterans are given a cool character with the opportunity to shine.<br/><br/>A friend told me that the movie was what you would expect of it. It was true but, it contained all the elements I did expect of it, just much more of it than I could ever have hoped for. That said it really isn't very realistic, it isn't a deep perspective shifting drama with an important statement. But who expected that? The best statement made, as one characters puts it, is made best by huge explosions. This is a movie made for entertainment, and it does. Massively.<br/><br/>9/10"
"TheUnseenMovieLover","5","2","6","2 September 2010"," Too Much of a Throw-Away Movie - Disappointing
","What do you expect from a movie like The Expendables? Tremendous performances, an Oscar-worthy screenplay, rich characters and multi-layered direction? If so, abandon all hope. The Expendables has been hyped up to be one of the most masculine films of recent years, a film so manly that if a woman were to watch it, she'd probably be sporting a beard by the end. What I wanted from The Expendables was some kick-ass, old-school action, along with a few memorable one-liners and some truly nasty bad guys. Even with these lowered expectations, I was still disappointed by The Expendables.<br/><br/>The plot's probably not going to be on people's minds when they watch this movie, but it's still weak. Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone, who also directs) is the leader of the titular team of mercenaries. After an impressive opening in which Ross and his team, including Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) and Ying Yang (what?!) (Jet Li) save a group of hostages from Somali pirates, an offer is put Barney's way by a CIA agent named Church (Bruce Willis). Their mission; to land on a hostile island and kill a South American general (David Zayas) and his partner, a rogue CIA agent called Munroe (Eric Roberts). Things become personal for Barney when he forms a connection with Sandra (Giselle Itie), a woman on the island, who turns out to be the general's daughter <br/><br/>Most people are going to The Expendables for the action, and it wasn't as satisfying as I was hoping it would be. Don't get me wrong, there are a few crowd-pleasing moments; they just happen more towards the end of the movie. In fact, apart from the opening and ending of this movie, there isn't that much action. There are a couple of chases and explosions, but I didn't really care much about what happened. This is because none of the characters (other than Mickey Rourke's Tool, who doesn't even get involved in the action) inspired strong emotions in me as an audience member, and the dreaded shaky-cam rears its ugly head. No!!! What happened to the good old days of action movies when filmmakers kept their cameras still and showed us everything that was going on, in all its glory? Raider of the Lost Ark, anybody? Die Hard? Terminator? Predator? What's the similarity between all of these movies? They were all released in the 80's, the era that this movie is clearly trying to emulate. Why are these movies so much better than The Expendables? Here's a list; you want to know what happens to the characters, there's suspense, memorable dialogue and brilliantly staged and executed action. In The Expendables, the staging of the action sequences is good, but the execution isn't. The filmmakers couldn't even be bothered to use real explosions, putting in obviously bad CGI instead. <br/><br/>The performances aren't all that great, but you'd be an idiot to expect great acting work here. Stallone is a good actor, and he still has charisma, but Ross just isn't that interesting. Statham's decent, and he and Stallone share some enjoyable chemistry, but he's lumbered with a pitiful back story involving his ex girlfriend (Charisma Carpenter) and her abusive new boyfriend, which is just an excuse for a scrap in a basketball court; after this scene, we never see or hear of Carpenter's character again. Rourke is given a scene of big emotional heft about his character's regret which comes out of nowhere, and he absolutely nails it. With this one scene, Rourke immediately becomes the most sympathetic, intriguing character out of the whole bunch. Another big scene is the much-hyped meeting between Stallone, Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger (as Trench, the leader of a rival mercenary group). It's not as cool as it could have been, and the main reason for this is that it's all too short. Schwarzenegger and Willis are great fun here, but they're like the two popular uncles of the family who turn up at a party, greet everybody and then rush off again; for a scene featuring three of the most iconic action stars of all time, it's underwhelming. As Gunnar Jensen, a druggie member of The Expendables who is booted out early on and who seeks vengeance, Dolph Lundgren is surprisingly engaging, even though his character is the most poorly developed in the movie, and that's saying something when you look at the other characters here. None of the other performances are special; Zayas, Roberts and Steve Austin (as Munroe's bodyguard, Paine) fail to generate audience hatred as the bad guys, whilst Randy Couture and Terry Crews can't do anything with their badly sidelined roles as Toll Road and Hale Caesar, the other members of Ross's team (although Caesar has one bad-ass gun). <br/><br/>For what it's trying to be, a big, dumb and nostalgic take on the action flicks of the 80's, The Expendables isn't a complete failure. The action (for the most part) is well put together, the locations are strong, there are some memorable lines of dialogue within the context of the movie (Stallone's final put-down of Schwarzenegger's character is classic) and there are some solid performances (with one ace from Rourke). Plus, there is an manly appeal to the movie which makes it a perfect guys night out, and Stallone's direction keep things moving along nicely until the final bloody, explosion-packed climax. But I wanted more; more action, more Willis, more Schwarzenegger and more Rourke, amongst many other things. Overall, if you go with a group of friends, The Expendables makes for an entertaining time at the cinema. But there are so many other better films out at the moment that my advice is to wait until this comes out on DVD, and then watch it with some mates at home. The title cuts pretty close to what makes this movie, in my book, a disappointment; it's just too expendable."
"harrycloke","3","2","6","31 August 2010"," Bad Shakespeare
","Last year we saw 79 year-old Clint Eastwood knocking heads as Walt Kowalski in Gran Torino. This year, Sly Stallone (64 years-old) indulges in a game of one-upmanship by uniting the ageing talent of the 80's and early 90's action movies for The Expendables. Thus we have Sly, Dolph Lundgren (52), Mickey Rourke (57) and in cameo roles Bruce Willis (55) and Arnie (63) together on screen for the first time flexing their muscles and spouting one-liners using a wide range of accents and varying degrees of mumbling. Thankfully there is an injection of young blood too, with Jason Statham, Jet Li, Terry Cruz and a number of other relatively youthful studs battling it out along with the fogies. That's an impressive cast list and it makes for a good poster. No doubt Van Damme, Seagal and Jackie Chan are wondering if their invitation got lost in the post.<br/><br/>This being a film written, directed and starring Stallone, his hero Barney Ross is all together a different breed from Mr Walt Kowalski. Sly as Ross has everything your paradigm 80's action hero must have – bulging biceps, rippling abs, a near intolerance to pain and a macho exterior masking a somewhat more sensitive interior. It strikes me that the target audience for this film is so used to these character tropes and beyond that the style and language of an action film, that there is more fun to be had in toying with these expectations than there is in creating a film that meets these expectations exactly. But, this is the film Sly set out to make: an 80's throwback with a cast of some of the most beloved action stars of that generation. This is no Gran Torino, this is Commando, Bloodsport or Under Siege with an ensemble cast.<br/><br/>The plot follows a team of mercenaries led by Barney Ross as they attempt to overthrow a military dictatorship on a fictional South American island. It's soon revealed that the real 'baddie' is ex-CIA agent James Munroe (Eric Roberts) who hopes to make a profit using the island's natural resources to aid his drug trafficking. Munroe is a real 80's-action-movie, no-substance villain, with no motives beyond making a quick dollar and an unnecessary and unexplained sadistic streak. Ross's motives are questionable too. Why does Ross persuade his team to free the island from the grips of this military dictatorship? Can it be that our hero sympathises with the plight of the lower-classes who suffer under this new rule? No, the motivating factor here is his feelings for Sandra (Gisele Itié) the beautiful, uncorrupted General's daughter, whom he hopes to save.<br/><br/>The story is mostly just an excuse to move from fight to fight so we can see a variety of old favourites face off against each other. There's a degree of unpredictability to these fights that make them fun, even if they have been enhanced with CGI, or the erratic close-ups make them hard to follow. At one stage a fight erupts between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren for reasons too boring to mention. Although I was in disbelief at the film's choice of victor, the fight ignited something primal in me which I think goes some of the way to explaining the film's appeal. Many of us come to a film like this with prior convictions. Those who watched the kind of films The Expendables pays homage to have no doubt participated in conversations or debates about ""who's the toughest"" or which action-hero would win in a fight to the death. Our favourite action heroes come with expectations – they are the toughest or the quickest and they cannot be beat. So when two of them face off, we are already routing for one to win – there are added stakes which a fight between, say, Sly and an extra fail to inspire.<br/><br/>It's here that I think The Expendables misses a grand opportunity. If you're going to have a film that's as heavy as this on the action with this number of well known action stars, why not have them face off against each other more often? We have had plenty of opportunities to see Stallone and Statham battle nameless masses in the Rambo and Transporter series, but when will get the chance to see them face off against each other? The fight between Lundgren and Li worked for me in a way in which the rest of the film didn't, because I had an interest in which the victor would be that was above and beyond the plot stipulations of this film.<br/><br/>At its worst, The Expendables serves as a reminder of some of the worst aspects of action films. Undeveloped characters who fail to spark any interest (the attempt to give Jason Statham's character some background is predictable and tiresome), dull plotting and mindless violence. Stallone also fails to provide us with any memorable action or notable one-liners, two elements that were essential to the kind of populist action movie that this movie seeks to emulate. All this culminates in a final showdown where our team of unconcerned mercenaries lay waste island through various means in order to stop the nefarious Munroe and his men. It all reminded me of a scene from Team America: World Police, in which whilst attempting to obstruct terrorist activity in Paris, the ""Team"" manages to leave the capital in ruins, including the destruction of the Eiffel Tower (which in turn collapses onto the Arc de Triomphe). The Expendables could have worked had Sly chosen to have had some fun with a well known formula. As it is, however, it's a joyless, soulless affair."

","The Expendables were one of the best action movies of the summer, maybe of the year. Having said that , though it's good, let's not over-rate it.<br/><br/>Let's see. We have the story of an elite team of veteran soldiers who are paid to execute meticulous and danger services that no one does. Until this point, nothing new really.<br/><br/>But when the story is lacking , the action comes in. I have to say Stallone has done a good job mixing the scenes , since there is action pretty much all the way through the movie ; and when there isn't , we have world renowned actors so you don't mind a little talking.<br/><br/>I think the acting was good . Not superb , not heroic , just good. Then again , this was probably a movie most of em enjoyed doing ; it's not everyday you get to hang out with the best action superstars. Stallone was pleasant to see too, despite his age he still gives that Rambo-like look. It was, though, a bit disappointing when Bruce and Schwarzenegger just showed up once in all the production, they could easily have wider roles.<br/><br/>Despite the action scenes in this kind of movie are what make the most of it, they have also some common flaws. First, it seems the enemies and foes they fight have a reaction time of 30 seconds , since it's when they start to fight back after engaged. Secondly, they should really give some rifle training too , due to the lack of aiming . Seriously. Third and last, Sylv got to stop running : he looks like a half-legged mental retarded pirate when doing it.<br/><br/>The talking was decent , building a good mix of humorous and serious conversations , which gave a nice mood in the room. The effects were pretty decent , good enough not to complaint , considering the massive budget the movie probably had.<br/><br/>In conclusion , it was a pleasant way to spend the afternoon , watching a soon to be blockbuster hit."

","The cast is mind blowing, it's a collection of most well known action heroes and some villains. Like a high school reunion. I was really excited to see this one, it couldn't possibly be bad, could it? To tell you the truth, it's probably impossible not to enjoy this movie, still, considering the flaws, I find the current rating 7.4 too generous.<br/><br/>It seems The expendables is like a meal consisting of 10% food and 90% spices. The ""action heroes"" are strong spices, that usually don't mix well together, some fade in light of the others. Jet Li was virtually invisible, despite the screen time and seemed weak.<br/><br/>Some of the roles of the characters are really difficult to understand. The general's for instance. It's almost as if the whole script was made of action and THEN, they put in some reasons why someone shoots someone, it didn't really matter if it makes sense because, boom, boom, whoa, different scene, boom, you still follow? It seemed too obvious that some action scenes were sped up, played faster... very old school, very obvious.<br/><br/>It's entertaining, so go see it. But don't think while you're watching."

","I have to say, my expectations were very high for this movie, I was an 90's kid, and I grown up watching these kid of all out actions movies, with all these faces, so it was a pretty pumped into seeing this movie. Sadly, it wasn't the greatest flick of all time, but it wasn't bad also. It delivered on all it promised, pure testosterone, explosions, bodies flying all around! First of all, congrats to the director and star, Sylvester Stallone, for getting the all star action cast together to kick as much ass as humanly possible, giving us a treat which we all 90's kids always dreamed about. The movie follows the proper action movie concept. Though guys, suicidal missions, bullets and knifes flying everywhere, yelling, running from explosions, constantly throwing wisecrack corny remarks. The plot, isn't very original or strong, it could have been done a lot better, and this is the only downside of the movie..I think it deserved more thought, it fells kinda incomplete and vague....The cast, as expected, was totally awesome. What could have been a disaster of conflicting egos, ended up being a perfect mercenary team, everybody in there right place. The long anticipated cameo was short, funny and cool, and I think it left a good mark on the movie, and a memorable moment in cinema history. All in all, this movie is just pure ""menergy"", a poem for the gun nuts, and a time travel moment for all us who grown up watching these dudes save the world endless times...thanks Sly for the memories, a job well done...."
"rejzer","8","2","6","23 August 2010"," Fast pace & Lots of action !
","When you go to the movie like this, what do you expect ? What should you expect ? To me it's weapons, chases, woman, power, lots of death, massive destruction and of course tough guys who do not fear death (in case of this movie they actually enjoy it). I feel that lots of people lost the sight that this is a reference to the classic action movies of 80' & 90'. There is no reason for you to go to this movie if you want great plot and character development. It's all about constant suspense, explosions and gunfire. A team of mercenaries head to South America on a mission to overthrow a dictator. In fact they are not ordinary mercenaries. All characters are different and individual but they have one thing in common. They have been surrounded by death all of their lives. Some of them are starting to loose it along the way ( you will see what I mean ). The best character in the movie is Tool (Mickey Rourke). Unfortunately his appearance in the flick is somewhat limited. There is some crappy chit chat throughout the movie but one scene with Rourke compensates it all. I will not dwell on the plot because it's very similar to hardcore, kill them all 80' kind of movie like Rambo, Commando etc. All in all it is very nice piece made by Stallone. Only drawbacks are sometimes crappy dialogues and not so good plot development. But again, if you go that kind of movie do you want sensitive moments, empathy for characters, great scenery and music ? Or maybe joyful massive murder all around the place, classic action style and actors ? If you choose the latter I strongly suggest that you watch this movie ! NOW !"
"Legendary_Badass","7","4","17","13 August 2010"," Testosterone so thick you can cut it with a machete
","The Expendables is the first/last action movie where the selling point is the aura of the ensemble cast, and this one has testosterone so thick you can cut it with a machete. Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone, multitasking as director and co-writer) is leader of the eponymous mercenary team. His number one guy is Lee Christmas (played by Jason Statham) and rounding out the team are Dolph Lundgren , Jet Li, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews—must of whom have loosely defined names. For $5 million in cash they are going to overthrow a rogue CIA operative named James Monroe (Eric Roberts), who has seized a small island where he profits from drug trafficking.<br/><br/>Rounding up this cast was a gallant move on Stallone's part, but he's never been a great director. The Expendables features some uninspired shaky cam and outlandish CGI blood, but it's worth mentioning that neither occur as often as I had expected. The theatrical score sounds like it was pirated from a bargain DVD and Foley mixing oversells every knife stab. The title sequence is among the worst I've ever seen and that's partially because it's essentially repeated. Obviously he was focusing efforts on the visual nature of the action, and on that end I didn't see anything groundbreaking nor did I see anything shameful. The showpiece stunt is quite nice. It involves Statham sitting at the nose of a cargo plane firing from recessed machine guns as they dive as a dock full of enemy combatants; it's as thrilling as it sounds. In a time where everything seems to have been done, I have to say that I haven't seen that before.<br/><br/>Aside from a plot I wouldn't present for show-and-tell, the inherited dilemma of ego jockeying becomes insurmountable. Almost every male in The Expendables is/was a reputable name in action movies and often times the lead or only male on a poster. It's obvious that Stallone takes center stage, but with so many expendable men for the camera to switch to during a fight, the climatic battle is a dark blur of explosions. Each character may have a skill, be it knives, wrestling, or marital arts, but they are all relentless killing machines and a movie that maintains this single breed of character across so many actors can't stay interesting from start to finish.<br/><br/>We can be thankful that Randy Couture has limited lines, and I suspect he is as well. The rest of the cast has it either just as bad, or quite good. The much ballyhooed union of Stallone with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis is a short of sweat treat with some of the best laughs in the movie. The most dramatic moment is a simple recollection from resident tattoo guru Tool (Mickey Rourke).<br/><br/>Many of the actors featured in The Expendables are not finished, but for several this is a goodbye in the sense that this will likely be their last high profile movie. With comic book inspired films eating up the box office, the sun is setting on this brand of entertainment. The Expendables serves as a swan song for the '80s film. Once the cornerstone of summer, these Redbox renegades have bid farewell after this, their final stand."

","*This section might contain spoilers* The plot is roughly the same: a mercenary gets hired to make a coup in a far away country run by a brutal dictator, he goes there, scouts around, barely escapes then returns with a small squad and wrecks havoc. He even gets helped in both films by a girl related to the dictator. *Spoilers end here* But while in the first move there is at least a tiny grain of realism, here there is nothing but exaggeration. The mercs are superhuman who cannot be harmed and 5 of them defeats a whole army (btw don't get fooled by the cover: there won't be that many people in any mission only like 5), they are so pure hearted they don't care about the money, the main antagonist is as evil as Dr. Evil etc. And what really blew my mind was that utterly stupid plot device that - as I mentioned earlier - the mercs didn't care about the money, and wrecked the whole nation FOR ONE GIRL!!! Those damn white knights! Thet's the stupidest idea I've ever heard! As others have mentioned even the action scenes are so overly exaggerated they lack even the tiniest grain of realism thus challenging seriously your suspension of disbelief. I don't recommend watching this even for free. You won't get your 1,5 hour back! Watch Dogs of war instead! That's not a very good movie either but much better than this!"

","I am not sure what to say... Stallone should spend more money on the movie rather than on the cast. It's hard to see what actually happened especially in the fight scenes which is the most important thing in this movie. The movie wasn't funny at all, the shooting and explosions wasn't close too good, illogical scenes and the list goes on. <br/><br/>As a big fan of Stallone I am truly disappointed and sad at the same time. I like all of his movies that I have seen; while some are better than others, but this one I didn't enjoy for one minute. I hope that The Expendables 2 is better. This music describes how I feel on his best: Dan Hill - It's A Long Road from the - great - movie Rambo: First Blood."

","Given the amount of 80's action movie geek enthusiasm I had in anticipation of this movie, i was surprised at how little amount of fun i had watching it. It seems Stallone wasn't quite up to the admittedly Hurculean task of writing/directing/starring in The Expendables. There were too few great moments of interaction between the characters, not enough witty banter, not enough chemistry between the characters. Having seen the making of and behind the scenes footage of the expendables, it seems like Sly relied too heavily upon ad-libbing and improvisational dialogue due to his guerrilla style film-making approach. The action scenes were pretty forgettable, with the notable exception of the dual 50 cal/ flare gun dock explosion scene. Stallone and Statham get top billing and screen time, but Mickey Rourke steals the show with his dialogue on salvation and damnation. Dolph Lundgren upstages everyone else with his sheer presence alone. Jet Li's character gets some good screen time and one of the films best fight sequences, but again his dialogue is awkwardly written. Eric Roberts does an adequate job in the villain role, but couldn't they have found a better actor to go up against this dream team of Hollywood titans? The rest of the cast is generally pushed aside and given only brief screen time which fails to leave much of an impression. Sadly the entire thing manages to underwhelm and seems to underline the fact that most of these guys best days are behind them. Which is a shame when so many of us fans were hoping for a glorious return to form. Still, The Expendables is worth watching, just keep your expectations realistic. 6/10."

","The Expendables are a band of mercenaries hired to topple a South American dictator who is running drugs in league with a rogue CIA agent. Things get complicated when a brave young woman leading the fight against the dictator turns out to be his daughter ...<br/><br/>I love action movies and I don't like being negative, but I have to say I think this movie is a bit of a wasted opportunity. It has a dream cast, great locations (the fictional island of Vilena was shot in Rio De Janeiro state), tons of fights, chases, stunts and explosions but for me it makes two classic blunders - the characters are all clods and the action is poorly choreographed. For a big budget film with such a prestigious international cast it looks and feels remarkably like any old Chuck Norris / Jean-Claude Van Damme / Steven Seagal action knock off. The fights, car chase in the middle and especially the big set piece storm-the-castle-and-blow-everything-up ending are all cut so fast, with little or no suspense, that it becomes just a fireworks show. None of the characters are developed and only Statham manages to add any kind of pathos or context to the action. It isn't a good sign when I find myself identifying most with backstabbing psychotic drug lord Roberts, because at least he's intelligent and has an ideology he sticks to. Criticism aside though, the movie does redeem itself with that cast; Stallone and Statham make a good double act, Li injects some much needed deadpan humour, Lundgren is agreeably over-the-top, and there are four champ wrestling/sports/martial-arts B-movie stars in Couture, Crews, Austin and Daniels. It moves along fast enough, and although there are no surprises as a park-your-brain blood-and-thunder actioner it's good fun. For bonus points, there's also an early scene in a church featuring Stallone with an unbilled Willis and Schwarzenegger which must surely be officially the most on-screen testosterone in the history of cinema. Followed in 2012 by a direct sequel."

","Like most men, I loved the idea of all the old action heroes getting together and giving a back-to-basics, fun and explosive 80's throwback that didn't take itself too seriously. Now, in the end I did enjoy most of it and would definitely check out the sequel, but what spoilt it for me was Sly's heavy-handed direction and mechanical dialogue. The action is filmed way too frantically, extremely up close with very quick cuts so it's almost impossible to tell what's going on and to who (a problem also in the recent A-Team remake.) The finale was just a fiery and explosive blur, which ultimately takes the intensity and the audience out of the action and feeling very detached. I see this as important because the film is a love letter to old action flicks. What made the action in The Dark Knight so tense was that it was approached methodically, very few quick cuts used to make it seem more realistic and little shaky cam. The Expendables camera shakes like an earthquake's hit it! There's also a problem with the odd really bad CGI effect, making the film seem cheaper than it is. However, I did enjoy the comedy aspect and the banter. The storyline was refreshingly simple and thus easy to get into, I just think it would've been a much better experience if Sly wasn't behind the camera as well as in front of it!"

","It seems like it is the year for mercenary movies, particularly mercenaries who are on the verge of retirement. Okay, granted, the only retirement age mercenaries in this movie are Sly and Lundgran (unlike RED, where all of the actors are retirement aged) , but they are still mercenaries (in the way that the A-Team are mercenaries). This movie is also a movie with an 'all-star cast', which is not surprising since Sly did direct it (and I never knew that Sly was a director, but then again, if you are as rich as sly, then I guess you can do, within reason' what you pretty much want).<br/><br/>The movie is about a group of mercenaries who take jobs that the government does not want to be connected with and are too dangerous for anybody else. As 'Church' (Bruce Willis) says at the beginning, there are three missions, two cake-walks, and one suicide, so Sly takes the suicide mission. The problem is that when he goes and checks out the island he falls in love with one of the rebels and lets his emotions over ride his common sense. Okay, he does say that he is going to do the job himself, but his colleagues decided that they will help him out anyway.<br/><br/>If you like action movies with lots of gun fights and explosions then this is an enjoyable movies, but if you like deep thinking movies with twists and turns, then don't bother. As mentioned, this movie reminded me of the A-team, and ironically, the same weekend I watched this movie I also watched an episode of the A-Team whose plot was pretty much the same as this one. Not a stand out movie, but an enjoyable one nonetheless."

","Disappointing: a lot of potential was squandered here. Jet Li's part was that of the unfortunate whipping boy. Some of the CG looks poorly done. There are a few genuine thrills in the big fights, but some of that, too, degenerates into a white noise of violence. CG and shaky cameras, the hallmarks of modern action movies, rear their head to get in the way of these real men and their real talent for screen combat.<br/><br/>The dialogue, too, is lacking. Obviously a stellar script was not going to be the main draw here, but most of the great action movies have some snappy banter and at least one memorable one-liner, where this has neither. It does try a few times (with the ""cauliflower ears"", ""I'm smaller"", and ""she's not your type"" bits), but these efforts fall flat. Indeed, with the notable exception of Mickey Rourke's monologue about his redemption, most of the non-combat scenes tend to drag. Also, both female leads have fairly small roles, unlike many great action movies, where their interaction with the hero is a main theme.<br/><br/>It strikes me as tragic that this film has grossed so many more dollars than its opening weekend competition, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World. While it obviously has a much larger target demographic, Expendables tries to get by solely on the reputation of its cast and a few testosterone-soaked fight scenes. It tries, largely without success, to merge over-the-top '80s action movie heroes with the modern action style. If you want creative battle sequences, good dialogue, intriguing characters, and a more appreciative date, go see Scott Pilgrim.

The point is the completely impossible plot line, the violent ways in which people die, and the lineup of action stars who have horrendous dialog where you just laugh, toss some more kernels of popcorn in your mouth, and elbow your friend in the seat next to you with some crass jokes.<br/><br/>The people who expected any semblance of a good plot missed the point of this movie - it's supposed to be stupid and over the top.

In short, this is epic film making in that it gives the audience everything it could hope for and much, much more. Every real kick ass player in this film has their moment of glory. And to my surprise, Stallone allows the big boys to shine, even at his expense. It's as if Stallone knew that although he is the star of this movie, he is not a true to life tough guy. But surrounding him are a plethora of real life tough guys. And the most brilliant thing about the film and about Stallone, is that every brute in this film has his chance to show the world their skills.<br/><br/>We've all seen the footage of Stallone and Austin going at it. But that isn't even the best fight in the film. There is a period in this movie where for perhaps 15 minutes, there is just non stop hand to hand combat. You have Li destroying men that seem to be twice his size. You have the incredibly charismatic Jason Statham showing off his hand to hand combat skills and one of the best scenes in the film shows Statham and Li double teaming one thug until they literally break his neck.<br/><br/>Terry Crews shines in the last 30 minutes as he carries a very big gun that literally blows his victims to pieces. And in a true example of Stallone showing that he has no ego, there is a scene where Stallone's character, Barney Ross, wants to throw a bomb high into the air. Then Crews comes up behind him and Ross, who is the smaller man, asks Caesar to throw the bomb, which is a bit too heavy for him. It's small details like this that make the film such an orgasmic action films delight.<br/><br/>You even have an epic battle between MMA and WWE legends at the end when Couture and Austin go at it mano-a-mano. And the results literally burn up the screen.<br/><br/>The Expendables is also shockingly funny. Stallone and Dave Callahan wrote a great script with many funny one liners and witty observations.<br/><br/>The best scene of course is the scene with Arnold, Bruce and Sly. In this three minute scene, you have some of the funniest stuff in the film. In it, Ross and Arnold's Trench are former Expendables team mates. In fact Trench used to be the leader of the team. But now he is a little older and a little out of shape. And Stallone milks this for all it's worth. The audience was in an orgasmic state of bliss at this point, and without ruining some of the best lines, just suffice to say that Stallone and Arnold do not miss a beat.<br/><br/>The Expendables is what an action film should be. It is a lot of explosions, larger than life characters, hand to hand combat, incredibly bad-ass men, humour and a frenetic pace. Even when it slows down to get to know these men a bit, guys like Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren and Statham steal the show.<br/><br/>This is better than Rambo, and in the pantheon of great Stallone films, this is one of the best.<br/><br/>9.5/10 You got a problem with that?"

","What a waste of some big name icons. The chemistry between this crew never develops like it does with the Ocean's series. The script felt like it was pieced together from paper-mache. The plot is jumpy with no cohesion and the dialogue is simplistic at best. There are attempts at story and character development, but they failed worse than I failed my first calculus exam. The lone performance with at least a touch of soul comes from Mickey Rourke, but he only has a minor role in the film.<br/><br/>So with all this bad in the film, could it be saved by the action? Not at all. I'll credit the action choreographer with some unique fights and original combat, but like the plot, it's not strung together in a well-flowing sequence like, let's say the Star Trek or Transformers action sequences. I'll admit the film was fun at times, but not enough to overcome the feeling of awkwardness every time Stallone or Dolph mumbled through their lines that didn't even really fit the scene. I'll be sure to stay far away from the sequel."

","I also made a video review on you-tube (VideoTorch - The Expendables). This is from the script of it (hope u enjoy it):<br/><br/>So, there's dear old grams, whom we'll call Sly for the sake of simplicity. He decided to round up the ballsiest white supremacists of the '80s and '90s. The only criteria to join was that they kicked at least a dozen minorities' butts during their career. After a few refused the call (Van Damme refused to get his butt whooped in the film, while Kurt Russel lost interest), the team was ready to shoot. Sly, The Governator, John McClane, Mickey the handsome, Dolph ""even the burglars sh*t themselves when they see my picture"" Lundgren, Eric ""my sister is the most famous, or not?"" Roberts, the thousand faced Stathem, two wrestlers or something.., and just to f*ck with the target audience: Li and a black dude.<br/><br/>Well, what's the film about?<br/><br/>Now, you might think I'm going to tell you the usual: ""It's the old story, about an elite team, who are hired to eliminate a local dictator, who's also a drug lord, and also very nasty. But then, it turns out, obviously, that it's all a big conspiracy and the corrupt people in the government are behind it yadi yadi yada.... Then the hero comes, and kills everyone, the end"" But no, this movie is not about that. What this movie is all about is a giant d*ck measuring contest. Of course, there will be some similarities to the story outlined above, but let's just take a closer look! So we have an elite team, lead by Sly. So, we can conclude from that, that Sly has a pretty big Johnson. Than there is Stathem, whose character has more similarities to a lap dog than to a real person, who's belly from time to time Sly will tickle, and give him food. If not naturally, but with some artificial help he also has a pretty huge dong. So, then there's Dolph, who is a bad guy but in a lovable way. I would say he is like an old dog who now pees on the carpet, and should have been euthanized a long time ago. In addition, he also bit little Timmy, but we hate the little f*Ker anyway, since we suspect that he is not our own, but we don't say that to the face of the little bastard, since we want to have some fun later on with his mother but anyway, Dolph has a big Willy. Then there is the wrestler guy, or whatever the hell he is, whose wiener is a bit rough and ugly, but big enough, although we only find that out at the end of the movie. Finally there are the black sheep of the team... well, to be more accurate, only one of them is black, the other one is. never mind So, Li and the other guy (the black guy). They really get the short end of the stick, to put it mildly. At least 10 minutes of the movie is devoted to dancing around the small Asian penis stereotype, while another 10 is devoted to disprove the large Black pen*s stereotype (Big muscles, big guns = perhaps to compensate for something?). So, these are our heroes. Now let's take a look at the bad guys. The filmmakers don't disappoint here either: they target America's largest minority, putting a large emphasis on the ""minor"" part. Even the dictator can't be taken seriously, because he loses all his prestige the moment Eric Roberts shows up in the symbol of western capitalism: a suit with a tie. At this point, I seriously started thinking about how on Earth they could increase the absurdity of the situation even further: Bust out the whips? Or a giant confederate flag waving in the background? Nah, the filmmakers were not that subtle. Instead, a a big, bald, blonde skinhead Neo-Nazi looking bouncer shows up as Roberts' right hand, simultaneously making every nationalist, white catholic j*z their pants. So, now that we have analyzed the deeper, hidden meaning of the movie, let's take a look at the execution as well. What more can we expect after so much cock, and minority stomping? Well, either one awesome bondage S&M p*Rn, or at least a Noe-Nazi fantasy like massacre. Unfortunately, we'll have to cool our jets here, because that's exactly what's missing... The Action! Well, that's not entirely true, because there's some imitations of it, but not the real thing. Ther's only one way I could describe it: It's like hiring Ron Jeremy to do a porn movie, one that would be aired on ABC Family, prime time. You kinda suspect something is going on, but can't really tell, because they mostly just talk about it, and the rest of the time the camera is so damn shaky you can't tell whether the cameraman is that excited, or is suffering from Parkinson's. This is incredibly irritating, given that if you sit into an action movie, the thing you want to see the most is the firkin' ACTION! Then there's a certain lack of creativity. What I mean by that is the quality of the one-liners, the variety of the scenes, but at least the f*king jokes! Because, thinking back on it, what exactly is memorable about the movie apart from the scenes with the governor, and the afore mentioned Asian d*ck size stereotype. Nothing! A big f*king empty void of nothingness! They could've at least gotten a unique score for the movie, which the average hick can download onto his cell phone to annoy the passengers on the bus with.

"CelluloidDog","3","2","7","8 December 2010"," Expendable, No Tough Guy Punch
","This could have been one of the ultimate guy movies. If so, Sly Stallone should have given up his director's and screenwriter's job...what was he thinking? It's as if Rocky Balboa himself wrote the script and directed...maybe with help from Mike Tyson. That is to say, it's written on a junior high school level. Considering the sophistication of action movies today, this film attempts to be a bit of an anachronism, a throwback to the 1980s to a Rambo/Commando tough dumb guy movie but in many ways, this film is worst. <br/><br/>The saving grace is having the presence of Statham, Li, Couture and Austin. Jason probably has the best script and role. He shines as the gunner from the plane and as a tough boyfriend on the bike. Jet Li is the butt of sad, stereotype jokes with a silly name like Yin Yang and is badly utilized. It's a throwback to racist stereotypes from old Hollywood movies. Coulture has a nice fight scene at the end. And Austin was quite credible and fun as a baddie. To note, Terry Crews doesn't have a great role but his shoot 'em up is one of the fun parts of the film. Mickey Rourke does a great job acting as he plays a role similar to his Iron Man 2 role (as Ivan Vanko) but I wonder if his philosophical rambling makes any sense in this kind of film. For Mickey, it is one of his best character roles (with Iron Man 2). Lundgren just can't act and his role doesn't make much sense. Eric Roberts is overly played as the bad guy. As many point out, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis are very underused; I can understand Arnold might be too busy as governor to lend much more.<br/><br/>Not only is the script really poor but the plot hardly makes sense. And although the action is very good, the camera work was mediocre. Back to the script: David Zayas plays a ridiculous role of dictator on an island that seems totally unrealistic. The connection between Sandra (played by Giselle Itie), the daughter of the dictator and Barney Ross (Sly) is awkward and out of the blue nonsense. Perhaps a few extra minutes connecting the two more emotionally might have made the film more credit. Otherwise the mission made no sense.<br/><br/>OK to have an old-fashion movie and use no CGI, but at least have a credible plot and script. I would give this film a 3 if it had only 2-3 of the stars. But due to the fun part of seeing all these dumb muscles, it's a 4.5 but there's no category so 4...or 5 depending on my mood. That is, your average movie...but a waste of a cast. A decent movie to see on a rerun on a rainy day with nothing to do and you feel brain-dead."
"petrkost","4","2","7","4 December 2010"," If you really have nothing else to do...
","It's a bit difficult to be serious about the film. Nothing you would not have seen before if you're above 18, including the (standard but weak) plot, fight choreography, effects, (feeble) dialogues etc. Yeah, a few jokes here and there but again nothing you would not have heard or seen before + kind of told unnaturally, as if in an expectation of the studio- laugh. Except for perhaps Jet Li complaining about his height repeatedly, which is quite funny because of who Jet Li is. First time, not so much the second and the third.<br/><br/>Very average movie, in short, that's an OK time-killer if you really have nothing else to do, like me one Saturday. Bit of a feeling that because of the great (rare!) cast, Mr. Stallone resigned on the rest, starting with the script, Rambo IV, for example, was five leagues higher. Just don't expect much and you'll get another story of tough but after all good-at- heart lads beating the heck out of the villains."
"eplanti","5","2","7","21 September 2010"," Were any actors expendable?
","Well, when I saw the cast I initially went AWESOME, then I remembered what happens when you only have two hours to tell a story and everyone wants just five minutes of dialog... Disaster. It was just a headache seeing how close they came in the first 15 minutes to hooking me, but it just didn't happen, here's what I saw, the first shootout brief negotiation, then all the bad guys get shot, do the good guys do anything totally bad ass? No, they simply go, I'll shoot really unrealistically fast and accurately, that's boring, and how is it gritty if the bad guys don't get a chance to be tormented by the good guys, are the good guys merciful? They could be smart and throw a flash-bang or have the case explode, disappear, bad guys start laughing, then start sniping while something important plays called a SOUNDTRACK, they take cover and get flanked, and it appears more and more dire for the hostage takers, etc, I mean, if the action sequences were intentionally, yet unintentionally (yes, I know that's a contradiction) torturous towards the bad guys, that's the film I want to see irregardless of some plot holes.<br/><br/>The even if you take out the action sequences which are pretty sloppily put together, you have to notice that the dialog actually sets nothing up, Bruce Willis wants the dictator or the guy behind him dead, but I was confused at why Sly and Statham didn't try the first time, Jet Li gets his three minutes explaining everything is harder for him, Couture gets to explain his ears which is pointless, Statham has a girlfriend and beats up some guy. Anyway, all the high profile actors got their screen time, and at that point you have 5-7 protagonists? I lost count at two protagonists. I barely made it through the final action scene, just boring watching all the actors AGAIN, each getting 3 minutes each of fight scenes, they could have at least combined the action so it was team effort, one guy assists the other but so it makes sense, you know, war machine? The bomb planting... did we even need to see the same actor plant 10 bombs each? Could we do one each, and faster so we can see things blow up sooner? To add to that, nobody dies at the end but the bad guys, I don't mean to say that was unrealistic, movies aren't, but I didn't feel that the expendables were quite that bad-ass at the end.<br/><br/>I dunno, I guess the movie's at least OK since it found an audience, maybe the sequel will be better, if there is one, and it's not as passive."
"Polaris_DiB","5","2","7","17 September 2010"," I'm here to see action stars fight each other, not speak. Why did Stallone waste my time with plot?!
","There is a Japanese movie known as Versus. In Versus, an idiosyncratic collection of characters find their way for various reasons to a forest, in which setting they fight. After they fight, they fight again. Some of them get killed. When they get killed, they come back to life and fight again. Flashbacks show they fought in the past. A lead-out shows they will fight into the future. Versus is full of fights fights fights and more fights. It's kind of pointless but at least memorable and strange for being a purely action movie with only the merest hint of plot.<br/><br/>That is what I thought The Expendables was going to be. It was not. Sylvester Stallone made a strangely bad decision and gave his movie plot and character development. It may be strange to say that plot and character development is a bad choice when making an action movie (many movies do this quite well), but the movie is, after all, sold as a wide collection of meatpacking action actors fighting each other... and there is actually rather little of that, ultimately. Instead most of the movie is watching Stallone and Statham quip with each other. Which would be fine if it weren't for the fact that the lines are delivered, as expected, clunkily. And then you get the fact that some actors, like Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwartzenegger, and Mickey Rourke don't even fight at all--though to be fair to Arnold, he's busy, and to be fair to Rourke's character, he does get a surprisingly amazing monologue near the end of the film.<br/><br/>So, indeed, this movie has a plot. The Expendables are a group of mercenaries who go around the world kicking ass and taking names, and after the success of one mission are contacted by a shady Mr. Church (Willis) to go to South America and depose a dictator. Unfortunately, when they get there, they realize they've been mislead into a situation involving a CIA agent gone rogue and become drug merchant (played by Eric Roberts, certainly running the fun badguy gamut with roles like this and The Dark Knight), who has set up a proxy dictator as misdirection to his scheme. Stallone himself decides to pull out of the too-dangerous mission, but the plight of the dictator's daughter (Giselle Itie) makes him reconsider the lives he's taken and the souls he has yet to save. Meanwhile, Statham pines over his ex-girlfriend gone run off with abusive jerk, Dolph Lundgreen sells out the crew because of an often spoke of but not really shown junky addiction (one gets hints of deleted scenes tying together the drug trade and Lundgreen's character's problem), and the other actors are just kinda there.<br/><br/>That's where the problem lies. By introducing an actual plot with character development, now the characters all have hints of stories and backgrounds that are interesting and left completely unrealized. You have Ying Yang the Jet Li character, who lies about stuff for reasons not really explained, a couple of Expendables in the back crew who have fun conversations but don't really do anything but just be there, and only a couple real one-on-one battles of any ""What would happen if this guy faced this guy?"" significance (the best one being Li versus Lundgreen). Eric Roberts' crew has Steve Austin and some other guy. Literally, that is all. C'mon, the set up is easy, split the cast half and half as two ""crews"" and then have the usual double-crosses to mix things up a bit! Instead we have just enough of a plot to wish it were more fully developed, and too much to fit in all of the head-on-head spectacles we came to the theatre in the first place to see; we have enough acting to see how the acting is lacking, and not enough to really test or expand the audience's appreciation for the capabilities of these names to act. You also get strange and ill-fitted morality like how ""We don't kill that way"" (but apparently, killing other ways is more justifiable or something--it's worth debating if it were, you know, actually discussed).<br/><br/>Yes. Nobody's going into this movie expecting anything brilliant. However, they are going in expecting some mad action facedowns from popular and well known action heroes of yesteryear, and the movie is relatively lacking on this point because the movie wastes time doing something that nobody expects will be particularly brilliant.<br/><br/>Or, to put it shortly, instead of watching Jason Statham fight a variety of other action stars to settle those ""What would happen if Jason Statham fought _____"" bets, we're actually supposed to sit through him trying to make us believe he's feeling sad about a breakup.<br/><br/>At least it showcases Mickey Rourkes' mad thespian skills. And the action scenes that do occur are quite actiony and action filled, with lots of action, as it should be.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

When I came to know about it, I thought it might not really live up to the high expectations. But after watching the movie, I must say I quite liked it. Definitely a must watch for action movie fans. It is the dream come true for almost everybody who would have often thought- How awesome it would be to see all our favorite action stars together!<br/><br/>The movie being directed by Sylvester Stallone also has himself as the central character along with Jason Statham who is awesome at action, and got a major part to play in this movie. Even Stallone, in spite of his age played his part sincerely. Some of the hype was also about Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis being there and though it was only for a scene, it was most enjoyable. Arnold unfortunately looks a bit too old. How I would have loved this movie to have come a few years earlier. <br/><br/>The only negative was that the other characters were quite underdeveloped, specially their partners in the team- Jet Li, Randy Couture, Terry Crews and others. Stallone put in a strong performance with a realistic character like wherein at one point after his fight with Steve Austin when asked what happened, he says- ""Got my ass kicked"". Statham is very likable, Li besides the fight added to the humor content, Dolph Lundgren was menacing and I guess will have a major part in the next sequel, Randy Couture is quite solid in the fights and Terry Crews was effective with the gun. Steve Austin hadn't too much to do and Mickey Rourke was just as an influencer of sorts.<br/><br/>But overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it and wanted more of it. Action lovers, go watch it especially to watch all the heroes together on the screen. But watch it with your mind kept aside, just for the action.<br/><br/>Well done Stallone for bringing all together and putting up some good old action show!"
"Whackooyzero","8","2","7","4 September 2010"," Where are all the complaints coming from?
","Okay I am truly mystified. I keep hearing a surprisingly large amount of negative things towards this film so I finally went and saw it. And you know what? As a huge HUGE action movie fan this movie delivered the goods and then some. You want stunts? Check. You want explosions? Check. You want shootouts? Check. This movie has all you want and more and I can't see how any big fan of action could dislike it.<br/><br/>But to be fair, there are some downsides. The biggest of which is the movie goes by too fast. They should have spent more time with the characters and the setup before the fight then they did, and there were a fair amount of lines that were a little annoying and poorly written. But you know what? That didn't bother me the least because the movie spends most of it's running time with the excessive and visceral action scenes that IN NO WAY are poorly shot!!! I sat there and I'll be honest with you I could tell exactly what was happening in pretty much each frame and the fact so many of you didn't I can only wonder as to where that came from. And it's not just because I'm a big fan of these guys that I'm saying that either, it honestly is fairly well filmed.<br/><br/>Any other problems? Well there is certainly a lack of quotable lines(with a few exceptions) and the Willis/Schwarzenegger cameo was WAY too short but the actual story and acting is better than you might think. Stallone, who has always been an underrated actor(from the Rocky series to Lords Of Flatbush, F.I.S.T., Lock Up, and Cop Land he has shown he can be a serious actor) gives a convincing though admittedly over the top performance as Barney Ross and Jason Statham has great screen presence and flair just to name the two main guys here. The plot is simple but effective and features a great performance by Mickey Rourke which helps establish the group's motive. The main message is of regaining your humanity and fighting for a cause though it's not emphasized too much.<br/><br/>So the movie is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT on the basic action level(seriously, this movie has it all when it comes to this and no matter what anyone says from my perspective it's some of the best action we've had in a mainstream movie in a LONG time) and is believable in a storytelling fashion. Plus it was a whole lot of FUN(not common in modern action movies these days) and I can't remember a time in the last 5 years I've enjoyed going to the theater this much. The reason I'm giving it only an 8 is due to a lack of quotable dialogue and near the middle a little too much of a rushed pace(and it's not as good as many of the classic movies of the 70's, 80's and 90's), but this movie delivers a great time at the theaters and will no doubt be a lot of fun at home on DVD so I recommend you ignore the naysayers(who by the way are wrong about these guys being too old for the job) and just enjoy a intensely macho, intensely visceral, and intensely entertaining action movie in the style of old and don't let anybody tell you it's wrong!"

","¨ We are the shadow, the smoke in your eyes, the ghosts that hide in the night. ¨ Sylvester Stallone directs, writes, and stars in The Expendables, an action packed movie that knows exactly who its target audience is: Men. This film pays homage to the action movies from the 80's and 90's, and either stars or has cameos from most of these actors (Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke, Eric Roberts, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger). The Expendables also stars some of today's action heroes as well such as Jet Li, Jason Statham, Steve Austin, and Randy Couture. Stallone had previously written and directed other of his movies, such as the Rocky and Rambo franchise. The reason I actually enjoyed this movie was obviously not because of the plot, but because it was just great to see all these stars working together and doing what they do best. The action scenes are raw and really bring back the nostalgic feeling of the 80's B action movies. The film will satisfy those blood thirsty action fans who want to see real choreographed action scenes, plenty gun and knife fights, crushed bones, and a lot of explosions without relying on the CGI effects. The Expendables isn't a smart movie, the plot is formulaic and predictable, but the action makes up for it. It doesn't try to be something it shouldn't, it knows exactly who its target audience is and will only satisfy them. It's not like ¨Killers¨ for example that really lost itself by trying to target different audience groups and couldn't be defined in any genre. The Expendables is a fun and entertaining action film and it doesn't try to be anything else.<br/><br/>Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) is the leader of a group of mercenaries who call themselves the Expendables. The team consists of Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), a man who really appreciates his knives and is having some love issues; Ying Yang (Jet Li), an expert in martial arts who is always being made fun of because he is the smallest of the group; Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), who handles heavy machinery; Toll Road (Randy Couture), the demolitionist, and Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) the sniper who is beginning to go a little crazy. The Expendables return from a successful mission in Somalia, although Barney has to cut Gunner from the group because he is becoming dangerous and unreliable. Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) offers the group a new mission on a small South American island where they have to overthrow the military dictator General Garza (David Zayas). The General receives the money to support his military dictatorship from an American drug dealer named James Munroe (Eric Roberts). Barney and Lee travel to the island in order to scout the enemy where they meet one of the rebels named Sandra (Giselle Itié). Barney decides the mission is too risky and doesn't want the group to get involved. He offers Sandra to escape with them, but she decides to stay and fight the enemy. Back in America, Barney has a talk with his good friend and tattoo artist Tool (Mickey Rourke) and he decides the right thing to do is accept the job and rescue Sandra.<br/><br/>The Expendables is one of those fun action movies that is enjoyed even more because of the cast. I would recommend this movie only to fans of the 80's action films who would like to bring back the memories. This is not a film for everyone, and is specifically a man made movie. I really had a lot of fun, but this is no masterpiece. This isn't a smart action movie with good dialogs like Tarantino films, but it has the best action stars who are really good at kicking butt. The movie also has a couple of funny scenes which made the movie all the more entertaining. The fighting scenes were excellent, there is a lot of gore, but the plot is pretty simple, however that doesn't take away all the fun you experience while watching all these men get their bones broken and killed. It has been a long time since I saw such a high body count, and gratuitous violence, but this is the sort of thing you are expecting from a movie like this. I didn't think I would have as much fun with The Expendables like I did, but this is definitely not a movie for everyone. If you hate violent films then you will not want to see this. This is for fans of the 80's action movies who would like to bring back some of the nostalgia.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"IDTooLong","6","2","7","31 August 2010"," Expendable movie saved by an unexpendable cast
","A movie with an all-star cast, what can go wrong? The movie plays out like a typical 90's action movie: guns, a larger than life hero (or multiple like in The Expendables) , high body count , explosions, and a very beautiful women that's on the side of the hero. Is the Expendables a good movie? Only if you don't set your expectations too high. Yes you could expect more for a movie with so many stars, yet we all kind of knew this wouldn't be more then a glorified shoot em' up flick. The expendables would definitely be rated lower if there were only no name actors playing in this. But then again the star cast adds to the charm and what is also a major plus is that the movie never takes itself too seriously. I loved all the little jokes. So ultimately The Expendables is a guilty pleasure. Preferably, The expendables should be watched with a group of friends and a lot of beer. 6/10."
"MovieManMenzel","8","2","7","31 August 2010"," ""The Expendables"" is definitely the adrenaline and action packed film it promises to be.
","A whole bunch of big name action stars from the 1980s and some of the more recent ones come together for the first time in one adrenaline pumping flick. The plot...while its almost invisible does actually exist. The film focuses on a group of mercenaries called the Expendables, who go to South America on a mission to take down an evil dictator. Pure 80's action ensues...<br/><br/>Sure, Sylvester Stallone's ""Expendables"" is short on story but lets be real it didn't matter. This film was made for those who love action films and that's exactly what this film was an action packed, adrenaline pumping thrill ride. I can't remember the last time I watched a popcorn flick that delivered on what it promised. I actually value Stallone for not actually trying to create a heavy story with this flick. I think if he did it would have sucked to be honest with you.<br/><br/>The movie brings almost every big name action star from the 1980's to today together in one action packed flick. Who is in the film? Well if you missed the commercials, the film stars Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, and Terry Crews. The cast works well with one another and no one surprisingly really stands out above anyone else. I would say, however, that Stallone and Statham are the real stars of the flick though. They are the two actors who get the most screen time and that works for the flick overall.<br/><br/>The movie itself is just an hour and 45 minutes of non-stop action. This movie brings me back to the late 80s and early 90s where action movies weren't afraid of just having action. Things are getting blown up every five seconds, there are car chases, a ton of fight scenes, and even more shooting scenes. Is any of this film believable not in the slightest but it's exactly what we needed as movie goers. We needed a kick ass action flick that didn't try to low ball us on action. I just find it interesting we got two of these in one summer with ""Salt"" being the other. The difference between ""Expendables"" and ""Salt"" is that this film really doesn't try to get all crafty with the audience, it just delivers on action. The problem with ""Salt"" was it tried to be smarter than it's own good. It tried to have the intelligence of ""the Bourne films"" but lacked in the story. ""Expendables"" story is almost non-existent but like I said before that didn't matter. We don't care about story...we just want to see stuff being blown up! <br/><br/>In the end, ""The Expendables"" delivered on its promise, it brought a bunch of big name action stars together in one big budget flick. I'll tell you right now, it didn't go above its expectations, it wasn't anything ground breaking nor was it fresh and original. This is an action flick, plain and simple. This film has done extremely well probably because it delivered on its promise. It was truly a ""guy"" film that men everywhere can feel good about after pumping some iron at the gym. Yes that last sentence is a joke but in all seriousness, guys who love action will love this flick. I am not even that big into action films and I have to admit it was a good time. Just suspend all belief and put your brain on autopilot and enjoy all the action your little heart can desire.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Expendables"" is a 8 out of 10. This was one fun filled and action packed flick!"
"mizan-islam-1","8","2","7","30 August 2010"," Who wants story.. Bullet & Bloood.. Kick-A**
","Powerful action-drama with a decent plot and good performances, especially by Jason Statham and Stallone . The sound effects, music, and action work together to rip the tension down off the screen.<br/><br/>Fast. Hyper. Action-packed. Insane and extremely entertaining too. No doubt a movie made just for the guys, it's filled with guns, car chases,random humor etc. The only thing missing were some fight scenes from Arnold and Bruce Willis that would have made this movie complete.<br/><br/>During his career, Sylvester Stallone gave the audience many great times to remember him.From Rocky and Rambo, to Demolition Man and Shade, Stallone was always a true super star.<br/><br/>The story moves very fast, but has time for some character development and character revelations—even if they become little blurbs here and there but it might be more an editing issue rather than a writing issue.<br/><br/>This is not a great but surely good movie for the people who wants non-stop action.Don't expect much from Arnold and Willis as they have guest appearances.Best action movie of this summer so far. (8/10)"
"klinklareonzinja","10","2","7","30 August 2010"," Wow !! Thank you mister Stallone and all....
","I am not a professional movie critic, but in this movie Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, Jason Statham, Dolf Lundgren (back from B-movie land after years), Mister Stallone, Jet Li and the rest did a great job. Yes the movie was violent, but the one-liners are beautiful.<br/><br/>The only thing I found disrespectful towards all who made this fun N Games movie, was the fact that Arnold and Brice only took short parts in the film.<br/><br/>However Eric Roberts and Mickey Rourke are truly great actors and even in an action movie this shows. The cinema went silent when Mickey played that one scene of powerful emotion. And Eric Roberts scared the..... out of my girlfriend. I know I'm just someone who loves 80's action movies, but I do hope mister Stallone will make one or two more parts of these kinds of films without the over the top special-effects you see too much of these days in boring movies (Transformers and other blah blah) and that he stays true to the real action movies.<br/><br/>No it's not Method acting for the most part and it is not Italian art movies, but this movie is a great way to escape the daily BS. It has one or two slow boring moments, but just as a fan I do have to say GREAT job.....and yes I have fallen in love with Charisma Carpenter, but that is an illusion that will stay an illusion ;- ) But she is beautiful...and yes this helps the movie in a tiny bit....<br/><br/>The story is simple, the violence is there and even Lundgren and Couture are acting good. I could go on for more words, but knowing mister Stallone or Rourke or the others will never read this, I just say thank you all and hopefully in part two of the Expendables mister Jean Claude Van Damme and Mister Steven Seagal will be smart enough and drop there ego (and weight) and play a part in it !! THANK YOU Mister Stallone from a fan !!"
"webmaster-3017","8","2","7","29 August 2010"," HK Neo Reviews: The Expendables
","A movie made for all action fans...<br/><br/>Stallone have created something for all action fans to cheer about. Gone are the days of Arnold, Stallone, Van Damme, Seagal, Willis, Norris, when muscles are a part of action cinema. In replacement we have Oscar worthy actors playing action heroes in Brody (Predator), Robert Downey Jr (Iron Man), Tobey MaGuire (Spiderman), and Christian Bale (Dark Knight). It seems that apart from aging martial artist superstars Jet Li, Jackie Chan and to a lesser extent Jason Stratham, special effects and quality acting have replaced brute focus and physical power. So Expendables is really a throwback to the 80s raw action cinema. Those looking for a story, please look elsewhere. Those looking for quality acting, please get real. Those who are tired of revisiting formulaic clichés, please depart. The Expendables is a movie made for real action fans and really you must be crazy not to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Few movies are bullet proof, in other words review-proof. This is one of them. Stallone have certainly aged since his Rocky and Rambo reboot a few years ago, but that is all in the looks. There is no question that Stallone still have the heart, passion and the will to continue making smashing action till it is totally over. Rising star, Stratham, the youngest of the entire lot, ass kicks a whole group of street basketball players. Li, the ever graceful martial artist out-kick the huge Lundgren in the coolest possible fashion, before losing to brute force. Mickey Rourke makes a fitting emotional display as a tattoo artist. Of course, as seen in the trailer, Arnold is back. Short, but effective cameo which only Arnold and no one else can pull off, so easily yet so fun. Mr. Bruce Willis who recently rebooted his Die Hard days, stray away from action, but his chat with Stallone is nonetheless, a fine cinematic moment. If all these fail to keep your testosterone in sky limit, then throw in Terry Crews and Steve Austin in the mix. Now be excited and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>All in all, The Expendables is a heck of a movie, but in best possible way. Vomit at the story and we get a perfectly brutal and straight forward action extravagant. Assembling a cast of veterans is easy, but for them to kick ass on screen and still be fun, Stallone have achieved the impossible. Sure there are flaws here and there, such as the limited use of Jet Li's fluent abilities and the non-fighting role given to Rourke. However, for action fans, this has been too long coming and finally the wait is over. Rejoice, go to the cinema and celebrate the fun like the good old days. As for Van Damme and Seagal, shame on you for passing this on and as for Stallone, it really aren't over till it is over – so bring on a sequel already...(Neo 2010) <br/><br/>I rate it 8/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"
"sureshanand9","7","2","7","29 August 2010"," Its a roller coaster ride!!!!! must watch for all the guys who grew up watching mind numbing action movies :)
","Well, let me start off by saying Expendables is an ode by Stallone to the much aped action movies of the 80's. The usual body parts exploding, head shots, knives... the whole 9 yards.<br/><br/>Expendables has a simple message at its heart. As Stallone adroitly says they are mercenaries who do jobs that other people wont or cant. Casting is a major plus. Statham, Li, Lundgren and Couture do ample justice. Steve Austin is awesome in his bad boy act.<br/><br/>The other cast mainly Arnie, Willis star in superb 2 min cameos that will surely make you wish they stay on. The girl (don't know her name) gets just enough screen space. The Dictator (""Angel Batista"" from ""Dexter"" series) is OK.<br/><br/>The drawbacks are camera work is shoddy. Stallone has gone for one too many close range shots during fight sequences. Also only Statham's character gets some depth. All the others including Stallone don't reveal anything about themselves. Dialogues are also clichéd. So are the jokes the men say about others members of the team <br/><br/>Special tribute to Mickey Rourke. Nice job as a Tattoo artist.<br/><br/>Overall Expendables is Paisa-Vasool for action fans but they could ve made this good movie even more iconic."
"dtjack-830-569449","8","2","7","29 August 2010"," Overall great movie! A few minor issues.
","This movie is a great, classic guy movie. The expectations were built up so high between the cast and crazy action scenes, and from watching the movie I can say it did not disappoint. The cast was supreme. With a cast like that no movie could be bad and I can not think of anybody else who should have been involved in it. Explosions, blood, crazy fights, unbeatable cast; this movie could not have been set up any better and had the perfect amount of action and fighting to not overdue it. <br/><br/>The only issue i had with this movie was Sylvester Stallone. He knew what a great action film consisted of and knew exactly how to direct to make a great film but he went a little overboard in his role. He tried to make himself much more badass than the rest of the cast. It made the movie seem a little fake at times and when Stallone was in a scene there was always some way to make him shine brighter than all the others. This was a huge cast and he should have known that that all of them were on the same level, including him, and the script should have portrayed that. If Stallone wanted to be the badass he tried to be in this film he should have hired a less experienced cast and tried to take off a few of his 60+ years. <br/><br/>This was not a very original script it seems like and watching it i felt like I was watching a new Rambo movie. Granted Rambo was great and so was this movie, but it was just all done before. Stallone being the head honcho killing everything possible is entertaining and can always be watched. Stallone loves the roles where he takes a beating and always comes out on top and they are always good movies. Rambo, Rocky, and now The Expendables are all great movies that will be around forever and will always be known throughout all generations."
"paul_haakonsen","8","2","7","29 August 2010"," Fast. Powerful. And to the point!
","This movie had success written all over it from the very day it was announced. And wow! What an action-packed fest this turned out to be. There was full speed and action from the very beginning.<br/><br/>Having grown up with the movies of Stallone, Schwarzenegger and the like, this movie was everything it should be. From the cool story, the fast paced action, the action stars and an all out blast of a movie.<br/><br/>I am not going to sit here and ramble on about what the movie is about, but trust you me, this is an action movie with a a capital A.<br/><br/>And of course, a very cool assembly of people to participate in it; Stallone, Li, Statham, and so forth. However, just makes you wonder why Van Damme or Seagal weren't here, or Chuck Norris for that matter, as they were big action stars of that era as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you are an action fan, or grew up in the 80's, this is DEFINITELY a movie that you HAVE to see. Would be cool with a sequel and have more of the ""old"" action heroes put together."

"andro-dolic","9","2","7","26 August 2010"," Great chance for summer blockbuster
","Summer in movie dictionary is period when there are movies which are going to fight for every dollar . Quality of movies is great but gross and strange opinion by public are going to smash point of movies . In Croatia it is similar opinion . I can't understand why people like only Twilight . Seems like it is only movie which can attract people . But, summer still can be great with movies like Toy Story 3,Inception,Salt and Expendables .<br/><br/>Now,about movie . This movie is really great theme for every ""movie man"" because so many old school stars can't be found on one place . This is great return of Stallone is really biggest surprise . Since I saw trailer before 3 months I didn't want to waste time and I set it as my priority . I am not big lover of hardcore movies . Rambo or similar movies aren't so good for me because they are only adrenaline bombs . But,after this movie I changed my views and I was astonished with formula which is attracting watchers . If girls like Twilight and Sex and the City men can like Expendables . This is real enjoy for men .<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is director and leading role . For this project he prepared himself very well . But,main problem of movie is that in quality of plot and scenario is bad . It is still missing some quality dialogues . Seems that we will still have to wait for some all round movie . Stallone as Barney was just as mix of world's finest fighters . It wasn't close to Rambo and it was not close even to Rocky . So,now when we mention Stallone we can remember even Barney Ross . Still , he brought great crime themes in movie . I like style of making movie . Really, all your senses are going to blow up how energetic this movie is .<br/><br/>Jason Statham as Lee Christmas was the biggest surprise . maybe in one nonsense role he is still rising quality of movie . It is bringing sometimes humorous and sometimes very brutal acting . That is just like someone would expect from this hardcore movie . In this movie we couldn't expect so important and so great performance by Statham .<br/><br/>Jet Li as Ying Yang was also one of real protagonists . I didn't like his sometimes irritating appearance . He was maybe too usual for that kind of movie . Stallone maybe wanted to choose all round cast . I definitely wanted some better performance because this was just a bit pity .<br/><br/>Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen was awesome . After his famous role of Drago in Rocky 4 I expected some killing machine performance . It was very mental role and he didn't have space to act maniacally brutal killer . First time I felt that he is quality actor .<br/><br/>Randy Couture as Toll Road wasn't so bad . He didn't have something special to show but quality of movie was bigger with his appearance . Stallone made a great job with this choice . His parts were always delighted with dose of humor .<br/><br/>Eric Roberts and Sean Austin as villains didn't look so notorious but I still can stand their performances . Maybe for some kind of great criminal they should prepare better .They didn't look so convincing but I think that maybe it wasn't so bad .<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke as Toll was great and very funny . It seems like old school actors can really beat others . In his scene he was really dominative with quality and great narrative parts . i think that Rourke still have qualities .<br/><br/>But, I don't know why Bruce Willis and Arnold Scwarzenegger had so small appearance . OK , I can understand that they are old but I still can't understand why Willis had so frivolous narrative part . Arnold was great and after many calm roles and he gave his best and I think he improved movie quality . I heard many critics that Seagal should have appeared in this movie but I think he wouldn't find himself . Jean-Cloud Van Damme too .<br/><br/>Effective adrenaline bomb still is missing some manners of great movies . I understand that it is not quality genre but I saw better movies . Still it is 9/10 because it surprised me with great performances and entertainment of action ."

","People going to see this film should not go with an expectation of a great script/ plot, but instead just go and enjoy it for what it is. Stallone has put together a great ensemble cast of action heroes past and present. There are some amazing scenes in this movie that i will remember for a long time.<br/><br/>Jason Stathem really shines in this film and has great on screen chemistry with Stallone. Stallone and Rourke work well together, but other members of the cast could have been put to better us.<br/><br/>I feel that this film, accompanied by Rambo has shown that Stallone has developed a new, more ''gory'' type of action film. This film is not afraid to show its audience what happens when someone gets shot close range, it doesn't sugarcoat it like previous action films.<br/><br/>Great film, great action, great experience."
"stalzz64","6","2","7","22 August 2010"," A male testosterone blood and guts fest!
","This is not a movie I would have normally paid to see, but my buddy was paying, so I said OK. The advertising campaign is misleading. Bruce Willis is NOT 'a co star', nor is 'the Governator' Arnie Black Plowman, they both have mere 2 to 5 minute cameos near the beginning of the film. It was fun to see old farts kick some serious booty. 64 year old Sylvester Stallone wrote, directed and stars here. The Expendables is typical male ego 'my d--k is bigger than yours' stuff. Not an Oscar worthy film, but a fluffy 'no-brainer' action flick that says 'let's blow sh-t up and kill the bad guys'. Typical macho stuff. I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it, but I did. Seeing crap like this in a theater is so much more fun. I usually wait to see the DVD or I frequently ignore films like this.Bombs, bullets, bodies....! I am NOT a prude when it comes to movie violence, but wow, this film is seriously violent and freaking LOUD! I guess I am too damned old at age 45.<br/><br/>I cannot even begin to guess the 'body count' in this film. It reminds me of 'The Dirty Dozen' a lot, story-wise. I guess that there are only so many original story ideas left in movie land. The body count reminds me of Sam Peckinpah's film, 'The Wild Bunch'. Old Sam brought the bullet hits squirting/spraying blood and brains in slow motion to a fine art. We as a society have been bludgeoned over the heads with all the blood, gore and Gut splattering in movies for quite a while now. Video games bring that 'kill as many bad dudes as you can and f--k people up' attitude as well. We think all people who are shot will get up and walk again because gee, in the movies & games it's all pretend, right? How many soldiers have a rude awakening on the battlefield realizing it's NOT a video game or a movie?<br/><br/>The Expendables has some 'Ultra Violence', most of which was CG. I HATE what CG has done to film. It's ruined it for me in a lot of ways. Now I know why I don't go to see films in the theater much anymore. Now I know why I love classic films made 'pre-CG' so much! Most of the stuff being released today is forgettable garbage, in my opinion. Maybe about 30-40 % of films released these days are any damned good. I really love the indie films, documentaries & foreign films being released these days.<br/><br/>The Expendables is a 'guys night out' sort of flick, a male YEAAAHHHHHHHHH! A Giant Testosterone fest! 6 of 10 possible stars. NOT FOR KIDS under 13."
"lupanu85","Null","2","7","21 August 2010"," I wish this would have been a straight-to DVD release
","Yes, I know. That statement deserves an explanation. After all, this is the movie we all dreamed of in the 80s. So why, then, do I wish this was a straight to DVD?<br/><br/>Well, because, quite frankly, I saw this at the cinema last weekend. It was money well worth, and probably the most enjoyable film I've seen all decade. It might not be deep, it might not be too stylish, but there are times when some coarse, honest action is just the thing you want to see. But going into the cinema, I realized just how out of place this feels on the silver screen. <br/><br/>I am fairly confident that even Winston Churchill himself would have felt the urge to call over a bunch of the guys, order some pizza and open some beers just so he could watch this movie the way it was meant to: in the living room, on the sofa, burping loudly, with a can of Budweiser in one hand, the remote in the other and pausing every 10 minutes to say ""that's awesome""<br/><br/>But, going into the cinema to see this, I felt somehow awkward for enjoying it. And I got the feeling that most of the other people did too. Were they embarrassed for being seen watching a B movie? Or just unwilling to show their wives and girlfriends just how much they failed to grow up since the 80s? I don't know, and I don't care either way, because I enjoyed it beyond words. But, in that huge, dark and surprisingly silent room, there wasn't that same feel I had back then, in the glory days of action movies, when renting a Stallone or Schwarzenegger VHS tape was the social event of the week for my generation.<br/><br/>In the end, it's solid piece of entertainment, that critics might never dignify it with anything more than a gilded raspberry, but who cares? If you ever liked this kind of movie, you might want to lock up your family for the day, throw away the key, and go see it now. My advice, however, would be to avoid the theater, and the next time you go out for a beer, bring the guys over and stop by a DVD rental on your way..."

Just raw coolness. <br/><br/>After I got back from it I was telling my wife about it, once I told her about it she asked, so this is a guy movie huh? I believe it is a guy movie but also has some light humor and emotional story lines that scream out - ""Watch me lady"".<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this flick is pure entertainment to be enjoyed by all who like to watch fast paced, ass kicking scenes."
"moviexclusive","6","4","20","13 August 2010"," No one makes 'em old-school action flicks like Stallone does- and this loud, brutal and violent affair is a homage to the 'Rambo' era that fans will find nostalgic
","Anyone who has ever been a fan of the big bloody action movies of the '80s must be eagerly awaiting Sylvester Stallone's old-school testosterone fest ""The Expendables"". It isn't just that it promises the same kind of lean, mean, brute-force action that Stallone's return to the Rambo franchise ""Rambo IV"" delivered so elegantly two years ago, it also boasts just about the most awesome ensemble cast ever assembled for such a flick.<br/><br/>As with his two recent comeback films- ""Rocky Balboa"" and ""Rambo IV""- Stallone assumes both writing and directing duties on ""The Expendables"", and his thorough involvement ensures that this film is retro in almost every way. The story is textbook old-school- a battle between two groups of mercenaries, one with a conscience who call themselves ""Expendables"" and the other devoid of it.<br/><br/>The mission that pits them against each other involves the fictional South American island of Vilena where a local despot Gen Garza (David Zayas) is making life a living hell for the locals. But of course, like any fan of Stallone's ""Rambo"" films will tell you, the real villain is really an American- this time, a rogue CIA operative turned cocaine peddler Munroe (Eric Roberts). Stallone's gang is hired by a CIA honcho ""Church"" played by Bruce Willis, and the meeting between Stallone and Willis also features an uncredited cameo by Arnold Schwarzenegger- the appearance of the triumvirate brief but tongue-in-cheek amusing in its allusions to the Governator's Presidential ambitions.<br/><br/>So Sly goes about rallying his crew for the mission- the likes of leader Barney Ross (Stallone), knife-man Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), combat expert Yin Yang (Jet Li), weapons specialist Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and Toll Road (Randy Couture) whose presence seems to be little more than just make up the numbers. Oh, they used to be six strong- their last member the live-wire gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) who goes off the tracks during the opening rescue mission and is left out subsequently after trying to kill Barney and Yin Yang.<br/><br/>Like most ensemble movies, the sheer number of supporting characters means that most end up underdeveloped- but specifically in the case of ""The Expendables"", one can't quite help but feel that much of the talent is actually wasted in bit roles here. Indeed, the film ends up more often than not feeling like a Stallone/Statham pairing, with scant little for the rest of the lineup to do.<br/><br/>In particular, Jet Li isn't given much to do except be the butt of the ""short"" jokes and Mickey Rourke's ex-Expendable turned tattoo artist Tool is also largely wasted, save for a monologue where he ruminates on his time in Bosnia when he lost his soul. If even the heavyweights like Li and Rourke are given short shrift, you can imagine the fates of Crews, Couture and Steve Austin who plays Munroe's bodyguard/henchman Paine.<br/><br/>But hey, most of them were probably not hired to act, but to fight- and in this regard, Stallone makes sure that each one of them gets at least the screen time to show off their moves. Statham's knife-throwing packs cool precision, Li's kung-fu fighting (choreographed specially by Cory Yuen) showcases his agility, whereas the rest of the cast demonstrate their raw strength. The mano-a-mano clashes here include Stallone vs. Austin (during which Stallone reportedly sustained several injuries), Lundgren vs. Li and Couture vs. Austin; and it's evident that Stallone gives his all despite being past his prime.<br/><br/>Much of the action is crammed into the last-third of the film, which certainly makes for an intensely riveting finale chock-full of extended fight sequences, loud gun battles and tons and tons of explosions. Yes, these were the hallmarks of the action movies of the '80s, and Stallone makes no apology for creating the same over-the-top preposterous mayhem that so defined the blockbusters of that decade. Pity though that his editors chose foolishly to adopt the quick-fire editing of contemporary action films for the fights, almost rendering the parallel brawls between the various characters in the climax to an incoherent blur.<br/><br/>A lot of the first hour is devoted to macho speak between the characters, and watching these guys taunt each other is part of the guilty pleasure that Stallone wants his fans and the fans of the cast he has assembled here to enjoy. It certainly helps when his actors are more than happy to go along for the ride, wearing their manhood on their sleeves while making fun of each other. Advice like ""a man who gets along with women is a man who can get along without them"" may sound anachronistic, but the actors know they are portraying men from a different generation, for whom riding on motorcycles and getting ink on their bodies were symbols of their identity.<br/><br/>From the characters, the dialogue, the story and the action, ""The Expendables"" is through and through a throwback to the action flicks of the ""Rambo"" era. It is also Stallone's last hurrah for actors like Lundgren, Van Damme, Steven Seagal and even Sly himself, who have in the last decade seen their movie stars fade into oblivion, relics of a bygone era consigned to the shelves of video stores.<br/><br/>Expectations are naturally high with such a cast that Stallone has assembled, and some may inevitably end up disappointed by the lack of screen time or character development for most, if not all, of the supporting characters. Still, this packs the hard-hitting action that fans of old-school action flicks love, and face it- you probably won't find another movie like this on the big screen in today's day and age, so treasure ""The Expendables"" for the rarity that it is."

","The Expendables...well what can I say...Its a dream come true for all action movie fanatics...A Great all star cast (albeit many were under utilized in their screen time) and a vicious, blood drenched, explosive, testosterone filled, adrenaline pumping bad ass movie that is one of the best pure action movies I have seen in a long time....the thrills, spills, bullets, destruction, mayhem and carnage is bloody fun..also the old 80's style throwback one liner humor signifying male camaraderie is back. With a stellar all time greatest ensemble cast comprising of who's who of action movies and two equally divine cameo appearances, this just does not get any better than this. I will not get into the plot as this is as feeble as it gets but that's fine because who needs a plot when a movie is this much fun to begin with...And what can I say about Stallone...this guy is a God...he is superb...to look the way he looks at 64, doing all this depth-defying stunts at his age with all his medical condition just for the fans, well this is unheard of. He is a great actor of this generation and Kudos to him for this kind of dedication and determination. Also, all the rest of the cast performs admirably lead by Jason Statham & Jet LI, with support from Terry Crews, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lungdren, Eric Roberts, Randy Coutore & others. This is a movie for the nostalgic action movie buffs...those who have grown up watching Cobra, Rambo, Predator, Terminator etc. and to all the whiners giving this movie negative reviews for lame reasons like too much violence, lack of coherent plot, shaky cam, no character development etc...well I have to say please don't watch a movie when you don't know what to expect from the genre... I mean no offense but If you find this movie not to your liking you should stick to Rom-Coms or Sitcoms...so please don't degrade the work done by a man who has shaped a generation and just sit back and enjoy the mindless annihilation with a bucket of popcorn...I am sure you will enjoy it."
"crossbow0106","8","3","14","14 August 2010"," Brutal, Escapist Fun
","This is a mostly fast paced, lively action film starring Sylvester Stallone as Barney, who leads a group of mercenaries of the movie title. Mostly, this film is about them being hired by the CIA to kill General Garces, the military dictator of the island of Vilena. However, the general is controlled by a rogue CIA agent, played by Eric Roberts, and the Expendables eventually go there to liberate the island and the general's daughter Sandra. There are cameos in the film, including a scene with Stallone, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, wherein the movie's best one liner is delivered (watch for it). Also part of the film is Mickey Rourke, the owner of the tattoo parlor where the group meet to discuss their next jobs. Some people have spoken of how little we see Arnold and Bruce, and that there is no scene together with Rourke and Roberts (remember ""The Pope Of Greenwich Village""?), but these criticisms are not valid. The movie is about the Expendables, and that is the correct focus of the film. The movie is excessively violent at times, but that is expected. Watch this film on a big screen, there are a few moments that will blow you away (literally). I like the direction by Sly, its tight and focused on the action. It correctly makes the mayhem seem edgy and purposeful. This is for action lovers, not for the faint of heart. It is especially recommended for anyone who grew up on those great 80's action films. Its a bit nostalgic for that reason. Welcome back to the genre."

","This is an OK movie enjoyed best at the cinemas! I am quite shocked by all the positive comments reffering to this movie as most of them seem to be oblivious to the fact that the storyline is pretty much non existent and the acting, with a couple of exceptions, is quite pathetic.<br/><br/>Stallone, I had hoped, would be hanging his action hero tag well and truly over to a younger and far slicker Statham however Sly still is basically the hero and Stathom takes the understudy role and figuratively speaking kicks Stallones ass! Lungren is talentless, Li is poor however underused and for my money becomes the whipping boy of the 'bad-ass' crew. Couture is underused too throughout and as for Austin..... I felt sorry for him as the movie went on as his role was basically grunting and looking tough.<br/><br/>As for eye candy....... erm ..... as a Carpenter admirer I felt robbed that she even gets a mention in the credits and I don't know too much about Giselle anyway but she acts tough and goes through a lot.<br/><br/>Willis and Arnie are pretty much cameos and even then Arnie never fails to deliver a role which a cardboard cut out could have beaten.<br/><br/>This is what I call a high octane, fun and brainless movie. At the time I wrote this review it was in the Top 250 movies of all time according to this site..... I would only put it in my personal Top 250..... and I have only watched about 600 movies! Personally I like to laugh when the plot is so thin and the stunts are soooo over the top.... so for that I rate Knight and Day higher as this movie tries to take itself more seriously and really shouldn't!"

(sorry...this is my point of view). It would be really nice from Stallone after all this killing stories to act in a movie which is to help people realize that violence can never be the solution to violence. It has never ever been. But we still keep on killing to destroy evil so we can create the evil in ourselves. I am sure Mr. Stallone won't see my review...but who knows...maybe one morning the action heroes will wake up with the feeling that they might have to start spreading another kind of message...."

Actually it's something like that since the plot's mechanics come and go with an ease that is to be admired. Actually its not so much the plot that is the reason for being, it's the wise cracks and the action. The wise cracks mostly work and the action is big, loud and bloody. Lots of bullets are fired, most of Western civilization is blown up and CGI bodies are destroyed. Its definitely not Driving Miss Daisy. It's sadly also not a particularly good film. Yea it fun, but I really didn't need to pay 11 bucks to see this. It's kind of like a version of Cannonball Run with explosives, with its huge slate of stars matching up with the cast of the early 1980's Burt Reynolds film.

","Seems like everyone has their own perception of what a ""good movie"" is and even furthermore what a ""good time"" is. The Expendables IMO has succeeded in many aspects of molding the two together. <br/><br/>I went to see this movie twice already and both times I've walked out feeling fulfilled. Perhaps it might be because I knew how to approach it. <br/><br/>The first time, I admit I felt a bit of conflicted angst mainly because I didn't know how Stallone can almost single-handedly create a decent product w/ all of that established star power. Too many times I've seen movies w/ big ensemble casts fall flat simply because there simply isn't enough space and time to get the most out of each performer. This movie has every right to be a big ""abortion"" mainly because Stallone runs the risk of having chemistry issues among a diverse cast of action stars from different generations nonetheless. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that he managed to pull it off! Was it as good as the first two X-Men movies? No, but Bryan Singer only had the one director role to play in that franchise while Stallone has to don several hats (writer, director, star, etc). I can only recall one other time I've seen anyone come close and that was Eddie Murphy's ""Harlem Nights"" project which IMO was mediocre at best. To me, the Expendables was a display of many multi-faceted stars w/ one common goal to produce an entertaining piece of film and that I can fully appreciate. <br/><br/>I guess the second time I went to see it was to ingest each actor's character contribution and to get a better appreciation of the actual story and once again I was not disappointed. Although this is a ""man's movie"" there's quite a bit of substantial entertainment to be had by all types of viewers. I guess my own biased criticisms is that there was not more involvement by Bruce Willis' ""Mr. Church"" character but that's cool because the path may have been laid out for that in the announced sequel(s)which many people have seemingly forgotten about or chose to ignore. I also really enjoyed seeing the more philosophical side of Mickey Rourke's performance in his portrayal of ""Tool"". I'm not going to give an individual synopsis as I've taken up too much space as it is but I'll just summarize by saying that everyone played their parts to the hilt w/ not much more to be desired. <br/><br/>I just have to laugh at the harsh criticisms and at times almost feel sorry for the cynics who seemingly don't know what to look for in these types of films."
"SPaS","7","2","8","24 August 2010"," Exactly what it's advertised to be
","Yep. Whenever I come across a bad genre movie, fanboys shout out ""what did you expect?"". Well, Expendables is a *GOOD* genre movie, and if anyone has anything bad to say about it, he's definitely in the wrong crowd. This IS supposed to be loud, dumb fun. A machismo over-the-top hailback to the 80s: nil plot, full-on action. Testosterone calls all the shots while female characters exist only as excuses for ""men of action"" to nix cardboard-cutout baddies in three-digit numbers. Bad guys miss, good guys walk heads up high and never-ending clips in their guns and mow them down. Dialogue exists not to flesh out characters, but to produce one-liners. Yes, I had fun watching this. Solid stuff which provides exactly what it promises. The old school action stars missing this one out (mainly Kurt Russell, Wesley Snipes, Steven Seagal and Van Damme) deserve a kick in the butt for doing so. But I still hope to see them in Expendables II. Especially Russell (c'mon, ""Tango and Cash"", mother fo!)."

When Barney and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) get there they meet a local girl Sandra and soon discover the way things really work on the island. When they escape and try to take Sandra with them, she stays behind, leaving Ross up with the choice of keeping his life and leaving, or going back on a suicidal mission to save the girl.<br/><br/>The Expendables had so much potential. It has a brilliant cast with Stallone, Statham, Rourke, Li and many other famous action stars, which I thought would have made this film much better than it turned out to actually be. It certainly had good points at times, like some nice action scenes. Over the top and unrealistic, like the way most people will enjoy. It was quite violent at times as well, and it had good acting from its legendary cast. However, I found most of the blood and guts to be kind of stupid. It reminded me a lot of the newest Rambo, which I did not like, just not as much blood flying everywhere. But considering the cast and explosions I think i'll let this film slip by with a fresh rating.<br/><br/>Overall, The Expendables will most likely please all of Stallone's followers, but in the end Rotten Tomatoes has it right when they said it should have 'hit harder'."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The most difficult movies to comment on are those in which even the filmmakers don't take themselves seriously. Here, Stallone creates a movie with his tongue firmly planted in his plastic surgery enhanced cheek. It is a bit goofy and meant to be so. The good stuff is actually pretty good, but the stuff that misses the mark is a bit painful to watch.<br/><br/>The good stuff includes the already infamous cameo scene with Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It has the single best line (maybe two) in the movie and it's just great to see Arnie back on screen. The other funny thing is the character names: Barney, Christmas, Ying Yang, Gunner, James Munroe, Toll Road, Paine, Hale Caeser, and of course, Tool. More work went into the character names than the balance of the script.<br/><br/>The parts that don't work include the lame one-liners that Jason Statham is forced to recite throughout. Also, Stallone remains in love with his own face after all these years. I believe he is off screen for a total of 3 minutes. And enough with the Jet Li short jokes. One was plenty. We could have really used more of Terry Crews. He lights up the screen when he starts his trail of destruction.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Steve Austin, Eric Roberts, Randy Couture and David Zayas all have their moments. But therein lies the problem. Just can't do justice to so many characters ... or is it caricatures? This one is exactly what it was meant to be. Don't expect the world's greatest action film. Think of it as more of a Tribute Film with non-stop stunts. Oh and a blasting version of Mississippi Queen by Mountain with Leslie West."

","I very often sat there during The Expendables wondering if I missed something in the story, but I didn't. The story never felt connected, and it really seemed as if it was just there to give a video game like mission so we can see some explosions. Regardless as to the debate whether or not there is a real story, The Expendables is an hour-and-half thrill ride that sometimes has plot holes in the little bit of story that there is, but this tale of a group of mercenaries, hired by the CIA to assassinate a drug dealing ex-patriot and his puppet general, is too enjoyable to pass up.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone co-wrote and directed this romp that is filled with gore and immense amounts of blood splatter. Stallone headlines an impressive cast of action stars from Jason Statham to cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzeneger. As can be gathered, there is little acting in this movie, just a bunch of shoot-em-ups and beat-em-ups, save for one scene where Mickey Rourke (the names keep rolling) reminisces about how he lost his humanity when he let a woman kill herself. Regardless, the action sequences are brimming with so much adrenaline, it's hard to be fazed by the shortcomings of the story.<br/><br/>As a whole, The Expendables is a mindless action flick with very little depth and ripe with political incorrectness (seeing as how every Jet Li joke was about his height, etc.), but the action is so unique, terrific, and nonstop, it's impossible not to get a kick out of The Expendables.<br/><br/>I give The Expendables a 7 out of 10!"

Yes, besides the action packed content, the movie was filled with corny and cheesy but totally appropriate and suitable humor and dialogues throughout.<br/><br/>With Stallone and Statham having the lead roles in that order, everyone else also had their moments to shine. The movie had taken ingredients from the action movies of the 90's, that we have all come to love over the years, but also had the brutality that we are used to see in the action movies of today.<br/><br/>The Expendables provided some funny references to real world like the president joke or Coutures cauliflower ear.

In fact, I don't think he's had this much pressure on him since he gave us a sequel to the groundbreaking Rocky in 1979. A lengthy string of hit and misses led to a noticeable lag in his career around the turn of the century, but then he decided to come out with the definitive conclusions to both his Rocky and Rambo series'. Both times, you may remember, he was derided left and right for being too old, and both times he proved everyone wrong.<br/><br/>Now he's back with a movie that's a deliberate throwback to the high- octane/low-intelligence action movies of the 80's, and ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you that the man has done it again. Say what you will about Judge Dredd or Daylight, Stallone has paid his dues and earned his respect. The man's a pretty amazing filmmaker, I don't care what anyone says.<br/><br/>Having amassed basically every relevant name in the entire action genre (in fact, it's interesting to consider when, with each new contract signed, well-established stars started applying for auditions to get in on the action), Stallone once again takes on writing and directing responsibilities and once again delivers a movie overflowing with pure, unfiltered badassedness. And the fact that it's stars have more than a century of combined ass-kicking experience doesn't hurt much, either.<br/><br/>And it's just as brutally violent and bloody as it's core audience demands, which is one of my favorite things about it. Imagine what a train wreck it would have been if he had watered it down to appeal to a wider audience! I shudder to think about it, although it might be the worst date movie since Fight Club, so be advised.<br/><br/>The story is the movie's glaring weak point, but when you have arguably the greatest cast of action stars in film history – even when most of them are well beyond their prime - , such things are, as they say, beside the point. Nevertheless, here it is –<br/><br/>An island country in South America is being brutalized by it's corrupt leader, who routinely terrorizes and murders his own people. The jury is still out on whether it's his lack of humanity or his crazy hot daughter that inspired a group of American badasses to swoop in and save the day, but regardless, his antics have angered the wrong group of people.<br/><br/>Stallone plays the curiously named Barney Ross (like the IMDb legend), the leader of the Expendables, which include the also cleverly named Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Ying Yang (Jet Li), Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), and, I kid you not, Tool (Mickey Rourke).<br/><br/>I'm curious to know who it was that was brave enough to approach Mickey Rourke himself and ask him to play a character named Tool, but no matter. Suffice it to say that each character has his own weapon of specialty (kind of like how the Ninja Turtles used to, except with more tattoos and chiseled features and less cheesy latex costumes) and that the sheer manliness of the thing will quite literally overflow into your lap as you sit there in the theater. I could have done without the serious turn that the movie mistakenly takes in the second half, but the rest of the movie is so much fun that it more than makes up for this ham-handed message about salvation.<br/><br/>But the movie is all about the cast. There were some marketing tricks pulled to make us think that certain people would be in the movie much more than they actually were, but to see all of these seasoned action veterans on screen together is pleasure all by itself. I'm more than wiling to forgive the recycled story about mercenaries when so many of my past favorites are back on the big screen, and a lot of the performances are outstanding.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke, in particular, steals every scene he's in and effortlessly nails a monologue that only a handful of other actors alive could pull off. You'll know it when you see it, trust me. And Stallone knows better than to do anything but roll the camera and let the man work. This is why I love the movies. It crushed that hipster trash SCOTT PILGRIM with conviction."
"igor_pu","10","2","9","26 August 2010"," Better than i feared it would be
","I read some reviews here that spit on this movie and on the characters Sly made. I went to see this movie, not because of the story and not because of the characters, but because i wanted to see all that action stars in one place and lots of ass kicking and impossible action. If you want a story go and see Shawshank redemption or Big fish.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with explosions, blood and massacre, but as well with funny punchlines that made the whole cinema laugh, and i expected nothing else. That's why i think this movie deserved a 10/10.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong-i love all sorts of movies, and the ones with complicated story are my favorite (Shawshank redemption, Usual suspects...), but this can't be compared to those movies. If you go to cinema to see this movie you don't expect to debate after the movie is over about the plot and characters-you expect to exit the cinema a lot dumber than before, and that's OK, I had my fun watching it.<br/><br/>P.S. what's with all that arm bars and UFC fighting skills? Before UFC not a single one action movie contained any sorts of arm bars, neck ties or any sort of submissions."
"hallmitchell","8","2","9","25 August 2010"," Amazing
","Hi.<br/><br/>While Sylvester Stallone had his career downturn in the late 90's and 2000's he must have been watching a lot of wrestling because his film borrows a lot of their strategy. Stallone has aimed his film for every Southern American male under thirty to go and see it.<br/><br/>The good guys have feelings and regrets over their kills while the bad guys are unapologetic and channel eighties wall street corporate greed.<br/><br/>I am still coming down from the intense gun fire and explosions.<br/><br/>My ears are still ringing from the sound of the automatic shotgun causing mayhem.<br/><br/>The one on one fights are the best seen in film since Rocky IV. No boring special effects heavy fights in this film.<br/><br/>Dolph Lundgren ( The Nordic Frankenstein) picks up Jet Li over his head and smashes him into an overhead walkway.<br/><br/>Stone Cold Steve Austin puts Stallone in a headlock and gives him an elbow to the back that would bring down a biblical city wall.<br/><br/>I have to give credibility to Jet Li. It was obviously him who had to be the team player in the this film because he takes a physical pounding.<br/><br/>I saw two people walk out of this film. I was shocked. The ninety percent of people who stayed cheered like a Parramatta fan winning a football game.<br/><br/>I haven't heard cheering in a cinema for years.<br/><br/>The soundtrack goes straight to the heart of the NASCAR racing crowd. Georgia Satellites, Creedence Clearwater Revival and the Guitar Hero classic Mississippi Queen by Mountain.<br/><br/>Stallone is now in his early sixties, when he runs he's so creaky and stiff that he's a shoe in for the role of the tin man in any future Wizard of Oz adaption.<br/><br/>Stallone has mellowed. While in the eighties he took out a whole battalion personally, now it's Stallone and five others that take out a battalion."
"PWNYCNY","10","2","9","24 August 2010"," Nonstop action
","Within the action movie genre, this movie has to rank at or near the top. This movie has a solid story, great acting, snappy dialog and fantastic special effects making it one of the great action movies. The movie offers nonstop action with characters who either very likable or very bad. Eric Roberts and Steve Austin are chillingly effective as the bad guys and Sylvester Stallone has never been better as the good guy. Things blow up, mayhem abounds and the action is fast and furious. Yet despite all the noise the story stays on track and remains well organized, comprehensible and interesting. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis have cameo roles that fit right into the story. There is violence but it's not gratuitous, it's integral to the story. The fight scenes are incredible. This movie probably won't be nominated for any awards and if that proves to be the case, it will be due purely to politics."
"poli373","7","2","9","24 August 2010"," Throwback to the 80s
","The Expendables is not for everyone. Judging by some of the reviews here I can't believe people would rate this as ""trash"" what did you expect? Oscar worthy performances? A breath taking spellbinding story line? this is a Stallone movie after all, a throw back to the cheesy action flicks of the 80s.<br/><br/>Let's get one thing straight, the acting is not the greatest, the movie is pretty cheesy, but its not about the acting or the story, its just about sitting down and watching things blow up for an hour and half or so.<br/><br/>If you want some violence and a enjoy the old movies of yesterday before the PG 13 action movie garbage ie A-Team & Live Free Die Hard, then you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>I personally enjoyed this film, because I grew up watching movies like this, and I just wanted some old school violence with a good cast of past and current action stars. Film snobs are just angry that a movie like this can make money."
"KarthikStallone","10","2","9","24 August 2010"," Old Horses back in Action
","Great movie..... Almost all the old action heroes in it. Everything is so balanced in this movie. It's hard to believe that though Stallone is quite old now he still has the motivation to do so much. Hats off Stallone. Beware....this movie is for men who like action. Girls interested in romance can go to other movies. :) Movie is Innovative and a lot of unexpected actions. Very good direction and creativity on the whole. Stallone has used his wealth of action movie experience in this movie. I wouldn't mind watching this movie again and again. I am sure I won't get bored :) ""It ain't over till its over"". After Rcoky, Rambo now Stallone is back with a group of action heroes. All of them have done their roles well."
"jonny_3300","9","2","9","23 August 2010"," One of the best movies I've seen for a decade
","i very much enjoyed this film, the things i like about it was it had very good action scenes, the camera shots were fantastic in the film to build drama and to give the atmosphere that scenes needed, amazing performance by all actors including actors like Sylvester Stallone, Mikey Rourke, Terry Crews, Jason Statham and many more including short scenes with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. certain scenes was used to shock you including a torture scene were they strap the actress onto a table and put a cloth over her mouth and then pour water all over her mouth so only water is getting into her system which shocks the audience. although its an action movie the good thing there was some cheesy lines which made you laugh a bit like when 2 of the actors in the movie are trying to go through customs the guy checking their I.D. says ""you look nervous"" later in the film before both actors Jason Statham leave the island and ready to kill everyone in the customs office (no civilians) he tells the man "" you look nervous "".<br/><br/>Like i said best movie i have seen for a decade the only reason why i did not give it 10 out of 10 was it could have included a bit more to upgrade its quality. for example the thing that attracts you to the movie is all the famous actors in it the problem is it does not feel like everyone else in the film does enough scenes and the majority of scenes are done by Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham and that other actors are in 5 scenes maximum. Also if the film was longer then approximatively 1 hour and a half then i would have felt less disappointed at the end of the film for it ending so quickly.<br/><br/>I'd like to say good directing and acting Sylvester and good acting from the whole cast, if you haven't seen this film yet and your at the right age range in your country to watch it i will definitely recommend you see this film."
"sherwin64","10","2","9","22 August 2010"," Feel good, feel fresh and overwhelmed
","With an exciting cast of film starts, there is good reason why this has been one of the most anticipated movies in a LONG time. In my opinion it lives to the dizzying heights set by the initial trailer and meets all the expectations set.<br/><br/>The Expendables is a tour de force for action movies made in the 80's and early 90's and simply put it is one overwhelming ride. Everything feels fresh, real and raw. It just makes you appreciate a real action movie without the need of wires or CGI.<br/><br/>As with previous action movies, the plot is simple - but can be interpreted in many ways. You could see it as a 'you crossed by path - so you are going to die' movie, or even 'There was something in the past I should have done, but I didn't do- now is the time I redeem myself' plot. Thats entirely how you want to see it, but really it never gets overly complicated and its pretty much BLACK AND WHITE.<br/><br/>The action itself is overwhelmingly good - a massive body count, loads of bone crunching action, explosions, bad guys getting gruesome payback - to name a few. At some point you'll just wish you could be such a BAD A** guy! It also is a throwback to a movie where men are really men - masculinity and testosterone are not sidelined. In fact they are glorified and so is dishing the pain to all things bad.<br/><br/>Also its great to see how a proper action movie is done, something that has been sorely lacking (bar a few movies) in the last 20 years.<br/><br/>Of course the movie is not perfect, no movie is.. but watch and enjoy the movie for what it is - an overwhelmingly fresh and good action movie! Do yourself a favour and go watch it! Stallone and company - I salute you! You make men feel like real men and here's to what we all wish - a sequel! Amen*"
"delomundo6905","7","2","9","20 August 2010"," It's an action movie, leave it at that.
","The Expendables is quite possibly one of the best action films I've seen in quite a while. The plot is actually at par. It doesn't get too involved which allows you to absorb the awesome action on screen. Which for a movie like this works. This is not a film that will go down in history. This is not the masterwork of a story telling genius. It is not Goodfellas, The Departed, or Inception, this is The Expendables. Watch this movie to love it for what it is, and action film. If you expect anymore than that your money is better spent seeing Inception for the tenth time. If you expect less you're just a dirty pessimist. So go get the guys together, grab some food at a crappy fast food joint, and go see this movie. It's a good film to see with friends, and will give you something to talk about."
"whosyourdrummer1","6","2","9","18 August 2010"," Legit action but what's up with the script?
","Before you read this comment do note that I thought The Expendables delivered amazing action sequences. However, one thing I noticed is that at times the script was very dull and a lot of lines seemed so bland and childish. Only some, however there were some cool lines, but others just felt sort of kiddie. Also, I felt as though the movie was rushed. Just as soon as the plot really begins to build up and make something of itself we are then told by Sly, that they have 23 minutes to shut the place down. Where did that come from? Why not continue to go slightly more in depth with the plot and really build something that will later be annihilated later. With all of the big names, the action definitely holds its own and really does deliver it's promise."
"diongram","8","2","9","18 August 2010"," Could be a top-class action film but still remains awesome!!!
","Well i saw this movie this week expecting a mediocre action-packed movie and the taste of pop-corns. I was surprised... It wasn't just an ordinary, boring, shooting and kicking movie but instead Stalone did a great job gathering all the known ""giants"" from action movies putting together a solid and non-stop action film with top-andrelanine scenes nice directing and the expected acting in these films. To those who expect culture and art cinema it is already clear not to come close to this but to you action fans (myself too) this movie is a must this summer. I would give 10/10 if the movie wasn't only 109 minutes making it very quick just before you were getting the spur for more action and also i if the scenario was a little more deep but thats a common problem in most action films. 8/10"
"Pumpkin_Man","10","2","9","17 August 2010"," The Perfect Action Film!!!
","This was without a doubt one of the best action movies of the year! There was plenty of shooting, killing, fighting, and explosions to satisfy any action fan. Sylvester Stallone and the gang are back with a bloody vengeance. Barney Ross, Lee Christmas, Yin Yang, Gunnar Jensen, Toll Road, and Hale Caesar are a group of elite mercenaries known as the Expendables. Barney is soon asked by the mysterious 'Mr. Church' to take his team on a mission to Vilena to overthrow a brutal dictator named General Garza. Barney and his crew team up with Garza's daughter and also tries to take down James Monroe, who controls the actions of Garza, in exchange for Garza's wealth and fear from his own people. I highly recommend THE EXPENDABLES!!!"
"yourfun88","10","2","9","16 August 2010"," Bad A$$!!!!!!!!!
","This shows that we really do not need over the top(pun intended) CGI to enjoy an action film. This movie set out to be what it was and it did a hell of a job. This was just an all around fun movie. I do not have a problem with CGI, it is just not always needed. Were there CGI effects in this movie? I am certain of it, but most of the movie was just a bunch of guys, some really big guns(the AA 12) and a lot of blanks and good old hand to hand and knife techniques. It looked like a dream job to work on this film. So many great action stars old and new. I was shocked to see Gary Daniels, but really, why not? Everyone else was in it. Rourke was great as always, but who knew Jet Li was that funny? He may have made me laugh more than Crews and that guy is hilarious. Of course I can not forget Dolph. It was great to see him back with a great cast and great project. The rest did what they do best, and I loved every minute of it. What other film can you have multiple real life champions, an NFL player, a pro wrestler, Statham and Rourke having knife throwing contests and Rambo/Rocky, The Terminator/Conan, and John freakin McClane in the same room?"
"discipled","7","2","9","16 August 2010"," End of an Era
","Rambo, Rocky, Die Hard, Terminator 1&2, Universal Soldiers, etc... I could go on. For the past 30 years we have been privy too an awesome creation. The Super Action Hero. These men were not made of steel (though i guess the terminator could have been). They couldn't fly or shoot laser beams out of their eyes. They were testosterone incarnate. They used knives, bullets and their bodies as their weapons. They were resilient, determined, and good. We loved to watch, as their chiseled bodies got beaten, stabbed, tortured, shot, and yet live on. Their guns never seemed to run out of ammo. The explosions were larger than life and the bodies continued to rack up. I gave this film a 10, not because it was necessarily, in and of itself, worthy of a 10 but because it symbolizes the end of the era of such films and film stars as were present in this film. I can only think of Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Segal who were absent. I give a 10 to the past 3 decades of grand action stars and ""Super Action Heros."" A 10 goes to the Jet Li's and the Bruce Willis' and Sylvester Stalone. Who can fill their enormous army boots? Who can give us the strong men from the 80's? Those men who boys idolize and practice their fighting moves on their friends. The time of the man who threw away what was P.C. and got dirty, tore up, beat up, needing stitches and stitched themselves. This movie even contained the typical militant central American drug runners and the corrupt business men and government agents. This film tells me that era is over. We're coming into the era of vampire loves stories and Harry Potters and the Matrix's. But instead of mourning, lets raise our once American brews, for they even seem now to have changed; owned by InBev, and toast to a time of GREAT American movies; a truly made in America classic!"
"pepe4u22","8","2","9","16 August 2010"," Action action and more action
","Waited with great expectations for this movie because it reminded me of my youth with the stars cast and the anticipation of real fast and non stop action and I was not disappointed. The cameos of the zenith of 80's action stars Stallone, Arnie and Bruce was like the meeting of the titans. The action started and never let up. The script and plotting were somewhat awry at times but who cares the action and the reaction of the audience made this movie fun.. The highlight was the performance of Eric Roberts and Mickey Rourke they were simply awesome.. Kudos to Dolph Lundgren for a nuanced performance and the rest of the stars shined in their roles...If you like action if you like to be entertained go to this movie."

And that's what happened , nothing more , nothing less . The movie is perfect for what it wants to be.<br/><br/>Pros : Almoust Everything , Perfect Action Scenes , good performances.<br/><br/>Cons : Randy Couture bad performance , Arnold not apearing more in the movie , the attempt of ading love scenes to the movie ( except because we got to see jason kicking ass some more ) .<br/><br/>Conclusion : Best Action Flick of The Decade , 17/20"
"philpriestley","2","1","3","30 May 2015"," So bad I'm even wasting my time writing a review
","This could be slammed quite genuinely as just a terrible, mindless action flick. That would be enough. That being said you might reasonably turn around and accuse me of being a film snob. There is a place for action movies etc.<br/><br/>OK. Fine. Yes there is a place for action movies. There are some great actions movies out there. Just trust me on this one - The Expendables is not one of them.<br/><br/>There is so much of this film that is about ego. Each of the characters (as crappy and wafer thin as those characters are) has to maintain a macho presence that is agreeable to the dreadful, should be dead, movie actor playing them.<br/><br/>The scene with Stallone, Arnie and Willis is cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>It all gets in the way of the film. What film there is. There isn't much film to get in the way of.<br/><br/>So you're always aware of the different dead beat stars - rather than the characters.<br/><br/>The dialogue is purile. The direction is awful. The stunts are actually pretty lame and for a movie that is supposed to be a vehicle for over the top explosive special effects - it is actually quite underwhelming.<br/><br/>If you want an enjoyable, over the top, pumped up, steroid filled action experience (and as one man once said - why not?) - you can find much better out there. This is just a terrible, terrible movie. So avoid it."
"Tweekums","7","1","3","10 December 2012"," Explosive action with a big name cast
","As the film opens we see a group of Somali pirates preparing to execute their hostages; suddenly their leader is lit up with red laser sights and a bag lands on the deck it is the ransom money; but now he wants more; inevitable that leads to the death of the pirates and more importantly serves to introduce our heroes; a group of mercenaries led by Sylvester Stallone. The mission is a success but one of his men, Dolph Lundgren, gets carried away and has to be let go from the group. Soon after Stallone is approached by Bruce Willis; he has a job for the team; he wants them to go to a small South American island nation and depose the brutal general who is oppressing the population. Stallone goes on a reconnaissance mission with Jason Statham. The make contact with a local who just happens to be the general's daughter; not long afterwards all hell breaks loose and the two of them are lucky to get out alive. The do learn one very important fact; the general is just a pawn of a former CIA operative played by Eric Roberts. Initially they think the job is impossible and plan to turn it down but Stallone decides he can't leave the girl behind to he and the team fly south once again and this time they mean business! <br/><br/>If you want almost non-stop action with gunfire, knife fights and huge explosions then this might be the film for you. It features some of the best known action stars from the '80s to the present day. Given the fact that Stallone isn't a young man any more I thought this might be a bit tongue in cheek but in fact it there are very few Jokey parts and Stallone still has what it takes to lead an action movie. The story isn't original; there were clear nods to 'The Dogs of War'; most notably their 'bird photographer' cover during their recon. The action is fairly relentless, especially towards the end but unfortunately it is a bit confused because everything is so dark. Over all I'd say this is worth watching but I couldn't help thinking all the main stars have been in better action films than this."
"TopperHarley29","6","1","3","16 September 2012"," Not as good as it could've been.
","The Expendables is an average action movie that is not as good as it could've been. This is just like Cobra where it tries too hard to be a cool action movie. The action scenes were cool, but everything else is either OK or bad. The dialogue is the weakest part of the movie. It could've been a bit better. Why does Lee Christmas talk about Dracula's life coach? Sylvester Stallone is just not a good writer. Another thing I didn't like was the intro. I didn't need to see a close up of Stallone's face. The only thing The Expendables should've been is a fun action movie. Not a wanna-be cool movie and to the first reviewer, no I did not expect award-winning performances or deep dialogue, but I didn't expect bad dialogue either."
"Thomas-Giffin","6","1","3","7 May 2012"," Directed by the wrong guy.
","So we are back to several action film trappings from the 80s, fictional South American country, large private army of what can only be described as warm bullet holders and a very male-centric world with women mainly in the peripheries. If you've seen films like Commando, it almost identical but with better stunt work. <br/><br/>In fact, given the reputation of so many of the cast (a reputation the film's success was founded upon), it is reassuring to see the stunts are good. Most of the cast did their own stunt and with Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham and Jet Li (to name a few), there is more than enough bang for your buck. Add in charmingly throwaway cameos from action classics Willis and Schwarzenegger (a bit unfair since if Die Hard 4 was anything to go on, Willis is STILL an action man), and you have a film that tries to be nostalgic but in doing so highlights just how little the genre has changed.<br/><br/>The script and dialogue is still rubbish, there are still hilariously dubious zoom shots of fists bumps, veined arms and tattoos. Whilst the film and the cast (and story) play to the expectations of an old school action film, it is revealing that it is only really Jason Statham that comes across as a real action hero. He is not a steroid fuelled melted waxwork, or a flesh coloured egg made entirely out of sinew, Statham is (and has always been) the achievable, human, emotional action man and placing him next to MMA stars, NFL stars and 80s action men and he emerges as the film's winner. <br/><br/>What is bizarre is that for all my........elaborate tastes in films, apart from Stallone, Statham, Li, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Lundgren and Austin, the other I had not heard of at all but they more than hold their own against the more familiar names. <br/><br/>I have no great desire to watch the film again, many of the older films The Expendables tries to homage are better and more inventive and with steadier camera work. The acting, script and story have almost always fallen away with this genre, the emphasis being on fights and explosions and The Expendables delivers on this level, as I expected it to.<br/><br/>I was just hoping that for a modern film to be made in the style of old action films, it would be a bit more clever, more nudge-nudge, wink-wink about the whole affair but the film is played straight the whole way through and since it was directed by Stallone, one of the old school, is that any wonder."

","The Expendables 2 film got into the news and I got curious what the first film was like, so I watched this one. I have grown up with Arnold Schwarznegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Dolph Lundgren and Mickey Rourke and I used to look up to these men as a kid, so it was great nostalgia to see those men back in business again. Mickey Rourke actually surprised me with some real acting moment actually, kudos for him, but to bad it was wasted in the wrong film, because this baby was all about action, hahaha! The film is a sorry-excuse story just to blow up some stuff and beat the crap out of some stupid people that got in the way, as of course expected. In that way the film really delivers and if you wanted anything else, then you are just a fool for even attempting to look for it in this film.<br/><br/>I hope the governator is coming back in the sequel with Jean-Claude van Damme, Christopher Lambert and Christian Slater. Would be cool to see Mr. T. and Jackie Chan as well, but I guess I am asking for to many 80's/90's actionheros now.<br/><br/>All in all I am going to give this film 6 out of 10; it was great entertainment, but a higher grade would be really to much."

","A crew of mercenaries called 'The Expendables' are on a mission to overthrow a dictator.The boys are back starring : Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren ,Mickey Rourke and Terry Crews and it's bigger and badder this time.<br/><br/>The film itself is compelling and bad-ass.I give all credits to Stallone for Directing this film and also to film one of the best moments including a nice fight scene between Jet Li & Dolph Lundgren damn was that some good stuff !!! Stallone manages to get those compelling images on the silver screen with big buff muscular men fighting each other and I have to say he certainly did a good job, they certainly ramp the word bad-ass into a whole new level and it also was the fastest 103 minutes of my life, I really do hope they make another sequel. In overall I would definitely recommend this film, it's worth your time & money. 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>STALLONE DID IT AGAIN WITHOUT Disappointing ME :).!!"
"Lash125","10","2","10","25 August 2010"," Pure awesomeness!!!
","Giving this film a 10/10 does not mean this is the best movie I have ever seen. It is, however, indisputably THE most awesome film ever made. EVER. There is more testosterone in this film than an 80's soviet hammer throw team. There is a variation of one-liners to which the writing-staff of CSI: Miami can only dream of; and it goes without saying that seeing just about every great action-hero produced in Hollywood gathered on a single stage really is something special (although Schwartznegger and Willis only appear briefly). If there is any doubt, this movie needs to be seen in context to the burgeoning amount of self-irony over the genre displayed. When two guys take out more than 40 soldiers on a recon-mission, there really is no doubt as to who will make it. <br/><br/>I have never experienced this much applause in a movie theater before, and I didn't really foresee that I ever would; until The Expendables. You'll have to be soft as a fluffy rabbit not to shout out in excitement when loins suddenly flies through the air from an overpowered machine-gun. Just about every action scene is innovative in its awesomeness. Whereas many movies such as this is repetitive and kind of loses its edge after a few minutes, ""The Expendables"" kept it going; and once you think it's about to get boring, something awesome happens. There's also a Mickey Rourke monologue, which stands as a contrast the size of Mt. Everest to the rest of the movie. It's really awkward, and that makes a nice reference topic afterwards. ""The Expendables"" is not a movie you download from a crappy torrent page, to watch at home on a 16"" computer. If you didn't make it to the cinema, wait for the bluray version, and watch it with all your friends on a big-ass TV, with surround sound. ""The Expendables"" can easily be summarized in one word: Awesome."

","This movie represents a genre that is desperately missed in Cinema these days, the genre of out and out action movies, no they will never win Oscars or get awards for best acting or best dramatic performance but it is a genre that most cinema goers love to go and see if done properly and The Expendables has been done properly by Stallone. It follows the basic guidelines for an action movie to work.<br/><br/>1, Basic Story with thin plot. 2, Cast Filled with Big action stars. 3, Big Guns 4, Bigger Explosions 5, Couple of Hot Chicks 6, One Liners 7, Cigars<br/><br/>I think Stallone has done a great job of bringing together a good mix of the top action stars from the last twenty years all into one movie, I wondered if the screen was big enough for all the ego's.<br/><br/>Many have slated this movie saying it is a let down in terms of the use of the stars on display, the movie was a poor and more was expected, some say the one liners fall flat and too be honest I felt that when i first watched it but after a couple more viewings this movie really grows on me its fast paced, doesn't take itself too seriously and flows a lot better after a few viewings. I thought the Stallone, Willis, Schwarzenneger scene was brilliant, only wished it was longer. <br/><br/>The final 30 minutes of the movie i have to say is one of the best action set pieces i have seen in along time, Stallone knows how to direct brutal action.<br/><br/>I pray there is a sequel and I hope we get to see Schwarzennegers team!!"

","I was born at the end of the decade but that doesn't mean I don't watch Stallone movies from the 80's. This movie was pure Rambo. Great explosions and actions and I hope they make a sequel so I can see more from some of the characters.<br/><br/>By far, the best performance went to Statham's Lee Christmas. The guy just owns the screen but Mickey's Tool gave a nice monologue towards the end that put some acting credibility into this testosterone fest. I hope the bring Tool into the fold more if they do a sequel which they should. The only problem I had was when they brought back Gunner. I don't mind that they brought him back but seriously there was no explanation. One day he's a traitor, the next he's in the bar having drinks with the team. That made no sense."

","The reason i have rated this film 10/10 is simply because its truly awesome piece of art in the history of action films and also to get recognition for it (thanks to the so called critics who give their corporate opinions in accordance to their paychecks). Even if the gimmicks may seem digital at times, doesn't matter, the feel that you get out of it is more than expected and accepted by any action movie fan and watcher ever. The screenplay and cameras are smartly projected which enhance the beauty of 'actual' and not digital sequences, performed with much hard work by all the stars of the film. Stallone understands direction, drama and emotion much more than most of the audience will ever understand, which becomes the primary criteria of the film and things revolve around it. Scenes like Stallone's fraction of a sec. reloads, Staham's superintendent knife moves followed by agile Jet Li and concrete Dolph, Randy and Terry moves and body language prove that. Being all talented and really 'Expendables' (for Hollywood) its hard to differentiate whether the actors are performing or are in their actual skin.<br/><br/>The simplicity and hard work pays... that is what the movie endorses and according to me has also prevailed !!!"

Using every weapon short of the atomic bomb, these guys rock the big screen and take no prisoners. The movie is a serious throwback to the 80s era of action movies. You know; the time when we could just take out the bad guys, and no one was interested in getting in touch with their feminine side. A rockin' soundtrack and a few inside jokes top it off to make a completely enjoyable, edge of your seat ride from start to finish.

","Let me start off by saying that do not believe all the negative reviews this film is getting from so-called professional critics, because this film was not made by critics. This film was made for action movie fans like myself who are tired of most (not all) action films of the past 10-15 years not living up to the standards of the classic action films made back in the 80's and early 90's.<br/><br/>This film easily recaptures the fun of classic action films by creating the perfect balance of action/violence and humor. It was quite a few of the best action sequences I've seen in a movie a while, and also has the witty dialogue and one-liners most action films are known for.<br/><br/>But the best part of the film no doubt is seeing many of your favorite tough guys on screen together. Seeing Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Austin, Roberts, Rourke, Couture, and Crews all in one movie is a dream come true for action fans. Especially the scene with Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis - which has some of the best lines in the entire film.<br/><br/>Overall, it is one of the best and most entertaining movies ever made. The film is action-packed and exciting the whole way through, and the last half hour may literally blow you away."

","Really excellent movie. For those that are '80s action film fans and '90s fans, you will love this. Sure, Arnold Schwarzenegger only make a brief cameo.. and I mean really brief. He is in one scene, says a few lines, and leaves and doesn't agree to go on a mission. There's all your favorite action stars that you've grown to love.<br/><br/>What's more to say about the plot? The Expendables are a team hired to do the dirty work, and they are hired to overthrow an entire Latin American nation being influenced by an American millionaire. Barney Ross and Christmas go on alone, and realize it's too much, but before they leave, they set off some huge fireworks. By fireworks, I mean explosions. They return for one reason, a girl. A girl that refused to leave the country even with all the chaos.<br/><br/>It's an action film with several scenes of heartwarming stories. Very brief, this movie is almost entirely action and that's what you've always liked about Sylvester Stallone. In his 60's and still rocking it. Have fun."

Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren provide some comic relief to this serious action packed movie.

"sonny-corleone","Null","1","4","31 January 2011"," The Expendables ' The last action hero '
","Hello Guys <br/><br/>'The last action hero'<br/><br/>When I say art we all know well true film fans anyway that an art is not just art house where its low budget and tear jerking which are yes good sometimes , but an art is when something that makes people cheer and whoop or think to some extent a way people look at a movie and hows its different from every other movie out there and the expendables does that. The action movies from the 80's ,90's yes are commercially viable making lots and lots of movie but are also a dying breed due to the insertion of the caring man , no longer to do we have the strong and silent Gary cooper and Clint Eastwood now we have and im not complaining because these films are much needed the caring man of Matt Damon and George Clooney two of my favourite actors no less Oceans 11 amazing , what point I am trying to make is that of The Schwarzenegger's and Stallones of the world are no where to be seen , no longer do we have the cheesy action movies that are big budget we have instead UFC and WWF funded movies that are low budget and Blow! Or contain a super hero once again not complaining but come on how many more can we have of these.<br/><br/>On to my Review the Expendables goes a long way to ratify that I am wrong about acting being a necessary part of a movie as this movie could have no speaking and be just as good that's what sort of movie this is and with a budget of 80 millions it makes it money back twice over, This movie is the most explosive action movie you will see this decade!<br/><br/>The synopsis is that of a group of mercenaries are sent on a mission 'to hell and back' to save a town and with this comes complications for Stallones character Barry Ross as he falls for the girl whom is daughter of the evil dictator running the town into the ground, nothing need else be said the rest of the movie is explosions kick ass moves and the best sounding gun you will ever hear in your life EVER god bless you Terry Crews. <br/><br/>A dinosaur has finally emerged from the ruins of a once great brand of block buster his name Jason Statham and I know all you Transporter fans will be screaming 'he's been around for ages' but now he is internationally recognized as a bad ass to boot. Jason Statham is the run away success of this movie for acting and martial arts ability , his comedic timing and distinctive voice really do make him the last remaining Action hero and good luck to him in his next movie 'the mechanic'<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is amazing yes Drago is played kind of weird as he is played American by Doplh Lundergren and so that bit is let down , but the rest of the cast have a bond that is reminiscent on the Oceans 11 movies that make you feel they did have fun while making the movies , on other ensemble cast movies 'the losers' and 'Takers' you just don't feel it and much the same as The A-team you laugh with the Cheesy one liners especially From Statham and Jet li whose broken English always makes me laugh. The reason this movie did so well at box office is for that reason alone it is change of pace needed for action.<br/><br/>Directing this movie must have been hard due to Sly being the director and understanding what the hell he is saying due to no facial expressions and the distinctive the Voice ' I AM THE LAW', But really this movie has no cinematography it mainly is just point and run away from the explosions if a another director where to be on the second one (rumoured) like Michael Bay or Luc Besson than I think this would work much better and Run much smoother. <br/><br/>All in All I would say this has Barlington's seal of recommendation as it does not contain a super hero and is an action movie a very nice change f pace!"
"harryparker42","6","1","4","25 January 2011"," From a different view, this movie is fairly poor.
","First off, it would be amazing if they sold this on video as well as DVD's. Which basically means, this movie is really an 80's film. This typical action movie provided enough adrenaline to keep me happy, so I'm sure it will with others. But really, the best part of the movie is the cast, a combination of the 80's action men, with the modern action heroes. Even Empire said ""the most awesome action cast ever assembled"". That is so true, classic actors lining up to do... lets face it, a poor movie. There are large chunks in the film where nothing happens, where there are others which cram ten explosions into one minute. I'm surprised it wasn't two hours like most films these days, in my opinion, thats a positive thing. Then again, there making a sequel soon, which could last hours. Hopefully the sequel will have more of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, who were both in the original for less than three minutes. The acting was average, the action was amazing, the story was poor. If they do another, they need to actually have a decent story. The purpose of this film was to pump people with adrenaline, in other words, mindless action. Its worth watching as its very watchable. Don't hold your breath though, its just there if you want to see something blow up."

The one-liners, mindless destruction, ridiculous action sequences, powerful explosions. But what I saw was a modern look at the genre. Don't get me wrong, the film was still brilliant - but I think it took itself too seriously - well it had its moments of humour and there were times when it went over the top, but it just didn't have that 80's action charm - I don't know how to explain it, but it was still good.

There wasn't much humor or witty dialog. I expected bit of a joke on their has been status but that was lacking. Think Sly needed some help with the dialog.<br/><br/>Although the main action leads were in shape their faces were old esp Sly. The romantic female leads weren't terribly pretty but then I guess they matched the heroes.<br/><br/>Some of the action at the end was too fast -couldn't make out who was fighting with whom. Also couldn't figure out why Eric Roberts grabbed the girl for.

If anything, the story could be seen to parallel the sort of 'mid-life crisis' that many of these aging action stars must be facing in one form or another.<br/><br/>The action is well done, though (of course) its often over the top and occasionally suffers from shaky-cam syndrome.

","The Expendables is a perfect example of the popcorn action movie. The action is over-the-top, loud, proud and highly entertaining. The action scenes are well shot and they move at a nice pace. The dialog is what you would expect from a mainstream action movie--there is plenty of dialog to give life to the characters while also allowing comedic comments that add to the flavor of the film. The dialog also helps to establish the friendship between the characters. Everyone does a nice job in the film: Stallone and Statham are very good as the two main characters, Austin is menacing enough as the heavy, Eric Roberts always play the bad guy to a tee, Lundgren is better than expected-as is Rourke, and the rest of the cast flesh out a nicely written movie.

","I'm not sure if Netflix's picture quality was just bad on my TV, or if the movie itself's lighting was just sorry. I think it might be both... <br/><br/>The Expendables has a serious lack of plot, which is dragged out by numerous escapades to foreign countries with beautiful scenery, (apparently a necessity for any action flick) and non-stop violence, which is supposed to make this just a good-time, man's man kind of movie. And it was when you could actually see what was going on. Sadly, more than half of the movie takes place at night, and so do the fight scenes. All you see in most of these are shaky camera angles, silhouetted fists flying, bullets randomly exploding in every direction, and crashes and grunts that are supposed to be relevant to the blacked- out action. There were a few scenes that were borderline awesome, and guess what? Those were the fight scenes that took place in the daytime, which includes a fast paced shootout, and a car chase featuring Jet Li. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was not supposed to be an Oscar-winner, obviously, but it was supposed to be just a violent, good time. But the camera and lighting quality was so poor that you could rarely see the fight scenes that you most likely expected to enjoy."

","The Expendables is a movie featuring an ensemble cast of action stars designed in a fashion similar to the old action movies of the 80's and 90's. For what it is, it's an amazing action movie with a great cast that includes the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Jason Stathom, Jet Li, Randy Couture, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, and more. <br/><br/>The plot is nothing too amazing, but it's good enough and follows a formula similar to the movies it pays tribute to. Basically, Sylvester Stallone plays Barney Ross, the leader of a mercenary group called the expendables that do dangerous mission for money. After being contracted to assassinate the dictator of a small republic, Barney deems the mission suicidal at first but has a change of heart when an innocent's life is at stake. It's the typical story of being the good guy, and blowing stuff up to stop the bad guy. Except it features an awesome ensemble cast. <br/><br/>This movie has it all in terms of fights. There are knife fights, gun fights, hand-to-hand fights, and explosions all over the place. The story is typical but the action is top notch, a true tribute to the older action films and a true delight for any action fan. The action is fast-paced, brutal, violent, and very well choreographed.<br/><br/>The main shortcoming the film has, though, is it's lack of attention to many of it's cast member. It has a lot of famous and talented action stars, but sadly many are downplayed. Sylvester Stallone and Jason Stathom receive most of the attention as they are in more action scenes and more scenes in general. They also receive the most character development. And Jet Li fans might be a bit disappointed as his highlight moment of the film actually makes him look kind of weak. The other members are simply underused. It's kind of sad because this is such a great cast that was recruited, and most of them could have been used a lot more.<br/><br/>As it stands though, The Expendables is an amazing action film that is a must see for die hard action fans. Check your brain at the door and simply enjoy all the ensuing violence."

Stallone prove once again that he rules and the other drool. we have Jason Statham, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis and Arnold, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Steve Austin as a team of mercs on a mission to save a beautiful woman from her father, a dictator of some south American country, before he can put her to death. on Hand is Eric Roberts as a CIA agent gone bad who is in cahoots with the dictator and wants to keep him in power.<br/><br/>buckle your seatbelts because the action heats up from here!"
"Alexdamien89","Null","1","5","16 July 2011"," A good-not-great action film
","Sylvester Stallion strikes back with this action-pack film called The Expendables, a movie he not only stared in, but directed it too. the film is about a group of mercenaries who were given a mission to overthrow a dictator in in Vilane.<br/><br/>This film was not great, but it was defenity not terrible, it was a fairly decent made action film that had a lot of action and intensity and a few wise-cracking one liners in there as well. Sylvester Stallon did not do a bad job with the film, but if there's one thing to complain about, it's that a few action scenes at another one of those things where the camera get's a little too close to the action. I could barely see what was going on, I couldn't tell who was fighting who, I tell ya my eyes were spinning so much, I thought I was gonna spin my head around getting dizzy. The jokes were not bad, my favorite joke was (SPOILERS) when Bruce Willis tells Stallion how Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to become president.<br/><br/>The cast members, of course, are spectacular, you got one of the best action pack legends, one of the best, Sylvester Stallion of course, Jason Statham, Jet Li, and even Mickey Rourke. We even get cameos from Bruce Willis, and of course the Governor of the west side of America himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>I'm not crazy about this film, but I don't think it's terrible by all means, despite the lousy camera work, this film was a well made action piece, if you're looking for intensity and......actiony(?), this movie will not disappoint you. I give this movie a thumbs up."
"mytoonarmy","Null","1","5","14 July 2011"," great action movie, better every time you watch it
","This is the film to watch if you just want to relax and watch a typical action movie, packed with cliché lines and great action scenes.<br/><br/>The film has you gripped within the first minute with probably the best scene in the movie. The dialogue is questionable at times but this can be expected and almost welcomed when performed ironically by Bruce Willis to Arnold Schwarzenegger. It gets better every time you watch it as you know what you are getting, lads movie.<br/><br/>Adding to this the cast is probably the films strongest attribute with all action legends in there own right coming together to make a film and sharing the spot light praises Stallones ability to take charge of a movie."

","""The Expendables"" might not have been everybody's cup of tea, but it certainly was mine. A few scenes seemed out of place, notably Jason Statham's personal life. We didn't get anything like that from Stallone nor Li, which seemed so awkward, since Statham was just a sidekick to the story compared to Stallone. That being said, this film was nothing short of awesome, especially on the big screen. The Expendables had just the right blend of action (lots of action) and great humour. It features an all-star cast with the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Stone Cold Austin, Mickey Rourke and cameos from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. And everybody (except the cameos) are kicking ass like never before. Seeing all of those old farts back on screen in the very same film was a pure pleasure. The Expendables is a tribute to 80s action films; nothing more, nothing less. And a fine tribute it is.<br/><br/>Moose finds this film worthy of a 10."

"oneguyrambling","6","1","5","27 December 2010"," A better title would be The Murtaughs - as they are all too old for this sh*t...
","Welcome to #613 in a series of films where Sly Stallone puts holes in people who speak English with a crazy accent.<br/><br/>The Expendables features a large number of tough guys with bicep measurements bigger than their IQs and has a higher body count than syllable count.<br/><br/>The good guys are always quicker on the draw, never miss, don't bleed and are ever-ready with a dopey quip, there are lots of BIG explosions, hundreds of faceless baddies die and no-one runs out of bullets.<br/><br/>There's even a damsel in a tower in need of saving. The best kind too, the one with big tits.<br/><br/>It is safe, predictable, formulaic, and just like your old scuffed slippers very comforting. This is the equivalent of Sex & The City 17 or yet another lousy rom-com with Jennifer Aniston and her latest rumoured baby-daddy. You know exactly what you're gonna get going in, so you're either happy in advance, or on a date and dreading the inevitable 90 minutes of ""hilarious"" misunderstandings.<br/><br/>And to think in the last 10 years there has been a dearth of real straightforward ""action"" films, where they haven't tried to be too clever or they attempt more widespread appeal by either toning down the violence for a more kid-friendly rating or add a comedy or romantic element for the ladies.<br/><br/>Well folks the ladies ain't coming to see The Expendables, and we have Sly Stallone to thank for that.<br/><br/>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <br/><br/>First up the title has precious little to do with anything in the film, it is the name of the group of mercenaries lead by Stallone. You've seen the poster above so we know a bunch of big guys are in this, the team captains are Sly and Eric Roberts (I'm as surprised as you.). When they decided on this game of pick up they had the following guys to choose from: Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Terry Crewes and Jason Statham.<br/><br/>This was never going to be Shakespeare. Forget the Expendables, half the team should have been called the Murtaughs - because they are definitely too old for this sh*t.<br/><br/>Couture, Austin and Lundgren can't act, and Jet Li tries but he is about as intelligible as Sly. At least English is his second language, Sly doesn't seem to have a first. But in a movie like this every guy could just say ""Uggghhhh"" a lot – and some do – and it would be just as good.<br/><br/>A sample of the dialogue that I could actually understand: Bad Guy - ""Who sent you?"" Good Guy – ""Your hairdresser."" Keep in mind that was a torture scene; witty, funny stuff! The Expendables are the good guys, Sly has been progressively getting a tattoo across his back with the team's name, I'm guessing after the first year he started pondering shorter names, or altering it to Depends and seeking sponsorship opportunities for his age group.<br/><br/>Many guys means a lot of action, but it does mean some of the leads are marginalised or only get a short span to exhibit their talents, Jet Li for one could have sat this one out and nobody would have noticed, he is one guy that is better than the material.<br/><br/>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <br/><br/>To acknowledge what everyone already knows Sly shares a 3 or 4 minute action-free scene with fellow 80s legends Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's fair to say that there are many reasons for Sly's longevity in this business, CGI, botox and 'roids alone added 10 years to his career. But aside from those handy helpers above all Sly knows what guys want to see on screen, bullets, explosions and blood.<br/><br/>See guys aren't very smart, we'll pay money to go to strip clubs to see what the internet provides for free - with $9 warm beer and terrible music hardly a deterrent.<br/><br/>Grown men go to watch professional wrestlers acting in sweaty loud plays and scream along passionately. In both cases we know what we will see, it will be exactly the same as last time. We go anyway.<br/><br/>Sly knows this, he knows these guys have a few bucks even after slipping their second to last $20 in a jaded girl's g-string.<br/><br/>The Expendables is exactly the same as 25 other films I paid money to go and see through the 90s. I and millions of other 15 – 45 year old guys would happily pay 4 or 5 times a year to watch the same film again.<br/><br/>For some reason Hollywood has forgotten about this.<br/><br/>For all my bagging of idiots like Jessica Simpson and Mariah Carey they are nonetheless millionaires and adored by legions of people with low IQs and questionable judgment. There is nothing too clever about The Expendables, it is bereft of intelligence, humour and logic. But by simply recognising that the dumbing down process is the drawcard perhaps Stallone is the smart one after all.<br/><br/>God I hope not.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6 / 10. Unlike Jackie Chan Stallone never relied on his athleticism, bullets don't get old and slow down."

","First of all, I greatly appreciated the fact that even though this movie was rated M, not every other word was ""F**k."" So many movies are. Kudos to the director! The camaraderie between the men was entertaining, endearing and awesome. I loved the sweetness with which Statham went back to Lacy, and when he saw her face, went and kicked the guy's ass-- and every body else's! Chivalry in a very bad ass kinda way. I also enjoyed the references to real life.

","The expendables, a must see for all of those people who love action and comedy at the same time. This movie manages to hold its' own against movies such as Inglorious Bastards, Shaun of the dead, and Shoot them up.<br/><br/>The acting makes this script come to life in a way that one would never have imagined. Watching each scene it is clear that while very little planning went into looking if anything that happens in that scene was possible, but what they have done is taken a lot of time to look at what camera angles would make the action come to life.<br/><br/>This movie is completely impossible in terms of its' stunts and action sequences, but some how comes over to be more believable than some of the other films that have been made in recent years.<br/><br/>The actors and the action sequences are what make this movie so enjoyable to watch. This movie goes to show that experience is for better than a moment of brilliants, a director who knew what he wanted to see on the final print, and camera crew that knew how to make it happen. This movie carries with it a feeling that it was not only fun to make for everyone involved, but also that the people who worked on it were passionate about what they did."

","2010 was filled with multi action, high octane and heavy explosive movies just like many years behind us. However it's quite hard not to notice that 'The Expendables' comes with a very demanding and watch worthy cast. And directed by one of the main characters, Sylvester Stallone with a budget of 80 million USD.<br/><br/>Plot written around 6 men who run lethal special operations for money, 'The Expendables' does not let down the action movie fans. Come to think of it this movie gives a huge supply of adrenaline fill action which does not second to any other movie recently. Maybe A-Team will stand tall against it but I doubt. And the impressive cast is unmatched. Some of the well known action stars from the 80s onwards contribute to the cast including Stallone, Jet Le, Stathom, Bruce willis, Mickey Rourke & Lundgren. And I sincerely hoped that Van Damme was included as well. But since he let down the character that was offered to him sorry dude you missed a huge movie! If you crave for action then there is no other good reason to watch 'The Expendables'. In between you may find a decent story line and very clever humor as well. Especially in places where you really don't expect it.<br/><br/>And let me remind you again, don't forget to wear your bullet proof vests. You cannot possibly imagine how many bullets that will come your way!!"

The Expendables is a traditional action movie, very little CGI unlike most movies these days and for those who love action movies, you can't ask for anything more than The Expendables.<br/><br/>As for the cast, the greatest line up of action stars. What more could you ask for! The cast works together nicely and the names do not clash. Everyone has a good role and nobody is left out.

"gogul1","6","1","5","15 December 2010"," OK but should be amazing!
","With an action line up of this caliber it's easy to see how disappointing it eventually was. Promises of Bruce willis, schwartzenegger, mickey rourke, jet li, Jason statham, randy couture, Eric Roberts, stone cold Steve Austin, stallone, Gary Daniels, dolph lundgren and many more made every action fan wet their pants. Sadly what you get is too many people, not enough screen time. Many big names fall short of a starring role, unable to fully be a part of it. Arnie and Bruce in a very weak cameo that looks almost like a laboured add on scene made so that their names could be dropped into the posters. Jet li fights that are so edited they break up his natural skills and speed plus Mickey Rourke sitting on a chair smoking a pipe like some sort of sage like caterpillar spouting advice to a very lost Alice... Er I mean stallone. Very misused people. Still it's enjoyable, several scenes made me smile including the initial escape stallone and statham perform from the island. Plus the opening scene. Dolph Lungdren is by far the unsung hero of this film though, his character is viscously under used and the most interesting, he should get better parts. So is this the final 80's swan song to action movies? No, you only need to look at the last Rambo for that. This, however could be a new action franchise as long as they don't try to use cheap name dropping tactics to sell the sequels!"

The second movie will be out next year and i will be there, (wene i stop crying over this). I hope Sly sort's out the dialoge as it was shocking.

","Sylvester Stallone never usually lets me down with his directing skills. I loved all four Rambo movies and the first three Rocky movies. But now we have the Expendables which is supposed to be a mindless, all star cast, no holds barred action movie with plenty of bullets flying, heads exploding, and lots of things being blown up real good. I knew what I was getting into but the movie failed for me because of two things. First, the camera shots. Yes, the camera shots are lousy. My other complaint is that a lot of scenes in the movie are too dark to see. Mix the terrible lighting with the lousy camera work and you have a disaster of a movie.It doesn't matter how good the action is if we can't even see what the heck is going on! But somewhere behind the madness there's good choreographed fight scenes and over the top action sequences. Too bad you can't make out what's going on in several scenes."

","The only reason I'm giving this a 4 is because, unlike the turgid RED, this old-guys-back-in-the-saddle tale is somewhat enlivened by the chemistry between the ""actors."" But, for the most part, everyone's worn out and tired, including a plot that wouldn't have been believable in the 80s and is even less so today. An island in the Gulf of Mexico has been taken over by drug lords and a rouge CIA agent and the US government doesn't go in with guns blazing? Grenada, anyone? There's a bit of fun in seeing some of the old guys kick butt, but character and plot development are lost amid the mind-numbing explosions and endless gun battles. A Swede (Dolf Lundgren), a Chinese (Jet Li), a Brit (Statham) are on the same team as Stallone and other Americans, but there's no explanation of how this motley United Nations black-ops crew came into being. Of the ""stars,"" only Stallone and Statham have the opportunity to generate any chemistry, but we learn next to nothing about them. Statham is, in fact, the standout in this film. He, along with Jet Li, is far from over-the-hill and brings a certain contemporary street cred to this otherwise mediocre film."

","A group of mercenaries take a job on a South American island to overthrow dictator General Garza (Zayas), but they find something else is going on there. <br/><br/>If you want to see many of your Action Heroes in one place this is the movie for you. And, if you add Karate fights, car/truck chases, explosions and gunfire for about 95% of the time, this is the movie for you. And, if you like seeing (or not seeing) most of the fighting, shooting and killing actions that occur in the dark, this is the movie for you. Give us a break. This was like an action video game. <br/><br/>The acting and dialogue were pretty good what little there was, however, the movie seemed more intent on getting back to fighting/killing and blowing things up; and the explosions were spectacular. But, like too much CGI in Transformers, too much hand-to-hand fighting, vehicle chases, gunfire, killings and explosions do not a good movie make. And, since most of the action was in dimly lighted areas we really didn't care who was doing what to whom. The movie's Continuity Person had an easy job in here. In fact, we didn't care about any of the characters regardless of the times when no killing actions were on the screen. We just didn't care.<br/><br/>What did we like? The car/truck chases appeared to be actual stunts and they were spectacular and some of the best we have ever seen. We liked Eric Roberts and why don't we see him in movies where he is the good guy? Yes, many actors prefer the bad guy role, but too often we see Eric Roberts in a bad guy role and we want that changed. He is always Oscar Worthy and one of the best actors Hollywood has ever had. <br/><br/>There is one thing the movie got absolutely right, the title. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes.

"Matt_Layden","5","1","5","22 November 2010"," The Expendables falls short on expectations.
","A team of mercenaries head to an island to overthrow a dictator. <br/><br/>The entire plot of the film can be summed up in 12 words. Even less if I try. Merc overthrow dictator. There, only 3. I was somewhat excited to see The Expendables, Stallone having a throwback action film, with a cast that had jaws drop everywhere when it was announced. The sad part is, the film falls short in many areas and just meets expectations in others. For a film like this, I wanted to be engulfed in everything it had to offer, I wasn't. <br/><br/>The film stands out in the pile of films that hit theatres this year about a group of skilled guys with guns who have to kill people. The Losers, The A-Team and most recently RED. The difference is that each one of those was based on something prior. Be it a graphic novel or TV show, and they had a bit of revenge thrown in. The Expendables is simply about guys kicking ass. I appreciate Stallone for doing what he set out to do. He made a guy flick, with muscles, guns, knives, one liners and explosions. Yet, the film was still missing something, it had no heart.<br/><br/>Here we have a great cast, yet everyone is underused. Especially Dolph ""Drago"" Lundgren, it's almost criminal. With a cast like this you would expect everyone to get their moment to shine and have a kick ass part in the film. Jet Li does his martial arts thing, which we have seen before. Statham and Stallone are the only two characters the script pays attention to, everyone else is left to the wayside. Randy Courture and Terry Crews seem like after thoughts in this cast of characters. Stallone, you can't expect to give one character a big loud gun and expect everyone to forgive you by thinking he had a purpose. Mickey Rourke shows up, looking like he walked right off the set of Iron Man 2. His role is strictly dialogue and apparently gives Stallone a reason to go back to the island and save a girl. <br/><br/>Cordelia Chase or Charisma Carpenter, as her real name is, has two scenes. Both of them are a poor attempt at giving Statham some kind of backstory. The backstory is clichéd to hell and eye rolling. But, heck, what am I saying? Story in a flick with a bunch of guys who blow things up? I must be crazy right? The target audience doesn't care about that sort of thing. They want to see guns a blazin and explosions exploding. The last fifteen or so minutes is full of explosions, it is almost overkill. They needed to fill the running time so they added 5 minutes or so of just explosions. Exciting? Not really. <br/><br/>The fight scenes are poorly edited, hell even the famous trio scene is half assed. Stallone wanted to get so much in with Willis and the Governator that the scene is way to choppy and loose that it's just a mess. We get it, the three of you in one scene together, cool. Now let me actually enjoy it. Another nit pick I have, Stallone wants to celebrate the old days. The 80's if you will, with this film. Yet he had horrendous CGI effects. The green screen and the blood were so brutally obvious that it's jolting. What's wrong with squibs? If you really wanted to make a throwback action film you would have had those instead of CGI blood. <br/><br/>The Expendables is underwhelming, Stallone tries and has some moderate success. I couldn't get pass the whole going back for the woman bit. Eric Roberts makes a good bad guy, but the story revolving around him is pointless filler to get another 'name' in the picture. Stallone wanted to put way too much into this film and he seemed to rely too heavily on that dreadful line that will always come back to bite you in the ass. ""We'll fix it in post"". <br/><br/>No you won't."

The movie started with a very nice action scene. Stalllone and his team looked undefeatable. Then, it happened: I catched myself thinking: ""this looks like ""commando"", it's the very same plot"" I tried to keep away that off my mind, but when the movie ended, I couldn't help it: I saw a group of buddies, trying to save a girl kidnapped by a southamerican dictator and his whole army, inside a castle (why directors believe ALL southamerican dictators DO live in a castle?). They had the attitude, the airplane, the skills, the muscles, the foes and even the bad lines of... John Matrix!! 25 years ago, John Matrix did the same.

Jason Statham and Jet Li gave such remarkable performances that you'll forget that the fighting scenes are fictional, and Terry Crews astoundingly gave us viewers an outstanding role in such a seriously funny way as usual, and just adding that distinctive sense of humor made the film just that more enjoyable and may I add that its obvious that Terry Crews is a ""great dancer"" (Laughs).

But my expectations were dashed as the story failed to involve the viewer.<br/><br/>The actions scenes were brilliantly shot especially the airplane one. But something was missing. It is like a group of actions scenes strung together. The attempt to give a touch of emotionality to the film is a major failure.<br/><br/>The comic relief provided at regular intervals really helps the movie. Stallone and Jason were really impressive. Jet Li also did a decent job. Rourke was wasted and Jason's side story could have easily been avoided.<br/><br/>If this movie had a good director/writer like Nolan, this movie could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Another thing regarding the blood.

Several of the action scenes seemed to be played at a higher speed to make the fights look more vigorous. And the cut and paste of some of the action scenes make them difficult to follow. You have to just give up and enjoy the fighting for the sake of fighting (which is pretty much the only appeal of this movie). I expected a decent plot with the terrific cast of action hero actors.

There were also many minor characters in this movie that gave great performances, including Giselle Itié as the general's daughter.<br/><br/>Sadly, Jason Statham's role didn't seem any different from his other movies.<br/><br/>This ""film"" was a rare treat for me.

I used to love these types of movies and I know I shouldn't take it seriously but it is kind of disturbing that this how we choose to be entertained. I felt dirty like I was peaking at photos on the internet of a suicide or fatal accident. My morbid curiosity will be satisfied for a while.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I did enjoy it for the most part, but it was just way too much. It wasn't even campy, just grotesque. I wish the marketing would have mention that it was extremely gory.<br/><br/>And how is it no one died? I get the feeling the ego of the actors had something to do with it.

It's just pure rockin' fun, well-paced, with a cast of old pros that know how to poke fun at themselves, but damn, these guys look GOOD - a testament to serious gym time. Plus, the story moves along, a nice balance of some drama with spectacular explosive action. I was really impressed with a scene between Mickey Rourke and Stallone, during a serious moment - it was just PERFECT, beautifully done. Not to mention the way the action violence is handled - it's over the top but in the right way, and all six of us laughed our asses off - haven't laughed that much through a movie in a long time. <br/><br/>Flaws? A few, a bit less shaky cam, and the story has some holes and illogical moments, and the bad guy is a real weasel. I wonder if my favorite author Lee Child (the creator of the ultimate intellectual bad ass Jack Reacher) has checked this film out? <br/><br/>Anyway, had a few highbrow friends who turned up their noses, saying this ""wasn't their kind of thing.."" Well, they can snuggle down with their copy whatever philosophical tome they like, but on a perfect summer evening grab some friends and check these boys out - I was sorry when it ended and have my fingers crossed for a sequel.

Explosions, car chases, fight scenes. It has it all.<br/><br/>The only two things I believe the movie missed on are:<br/><br/>1. No good snappy one liners. No ""Stick Around!"" after tossing a bowie knife to the ribs. No ""If it bleeds..."", ""Go for it"", ""Surfs Up"" after hitting someone with a surf board. Very little of that.<br/><br/>2.

"mjscarface","6","1","5","30 August 2010"," Mostly successful and action-packed
","'The Expendables' is an old-school throwback to the 80s, we all know this was the intention from the beginning and overall I think it succeeded.<br/><br/>The plot is perfect action movie fodder; the Latin American dictator, the slimy villain in the suit pulling the strings, the traitor in the group, the gang of big hard-nuts carrying even bigger firepower etc. Aside from a sub-plot for Statham's character, which slows the film, 'The Expendables' walks a well-trodden path, but delivers some cracking action along the way. In terms of pacing, Stallone has ensured that the action only gets bigger as the film reaches it's climax. Unlike this summer's 'A-Team' which I enjoyed, this peaks at the right moments.<br/><br/>In this situation, analysing characterisation and story is pointless. Genre classics such as 'Commando', 'Cobra' and 'Predator' were about the mission in hand. The characters may not be as memorable, but they all look the part and get their chance to shine. Those films I mentioned were definitely snappier in terms of dialogue - which is my only real gripe with this film.<br/><br/>Like the last Rambo movie, there is a period at the beginning where the dialogue is forced and laboured. In 'Rambo', Stallone tries to make a point about humanity and redemption etc. but in this case it's more to provide a punchline on which to close the scene. The cameo with Bruce and Arnold is the best example; awkward and not very funny. Similarly, the group scenes (of which are surprisingly few) don't try hard enough to create a sense of camaraderie which we never buy into.<br/><br/>However, the stilted dialogue stops being such a problem once the plot kicks into gear on Stallone's first trip to Vilena. Speaking of Sly, it was nice to see the man himself back in some proper nasty brawls again.<br/><br/>This leads us to the action, which I think Sly has delivered on in spades. The final half-hour is obviously the talking point here, but I also enjoyed various sequences throughout. The dock explosion HAS to be seen on the big screen, it's that epic. Fight scenes were fast and brutal and while some people criticise the camera-work, I was never lost during these scenes. Only the car chases were too frantically shot in my opinion. The finale is truly some of the best action I've EVER seen with an energy that few films of this type manage to capture. Needless to say, the entire tunnel sequence (featuring some kick-ass brawling and Terry Crews' monster of a shotgun) will go down in action movie lore for years to come.<br/><br/>'The Expendables' never overstays it's welcome and that's a refreshing thing in this age of 150mins+ epic family movies. It's short, to the point and a great slice of brainless fun and I am certainly looking forward to the sequel!"
"KnightsofNi11","4","1","5","29 August 2010"," Action porn for the explosion seeking
","Stallone. Statham. Li. Rourke. Lundgren. Couture. Austin. Crews. With a cast lineup like this what could you possibly expect other than ridiculously testosterone fueled action. The answer is absolutely nothing more. And that is what you get from The Expendables. Sylvester Stallone himself directs this flick in which he leads a group of slightly more than able bodied mercenaries on dangerous missions in Central America. The team of hulking beasts shoot first and ask questions later. They don't take anybodies crap and certainly don't care whether they live or die, as long as they get to blow everything up. It's a 12 year old child's action explosion fantasy. Expect nothing more.<br/><br/>The film kicks off with these mercenaries on a hostage rescue mission where they brutally shoot up everything and make sure nobody has a less than ecstatic death. The relationships between these guys are quickly established and we essentially learn everything we need to know about them in the first 20-30 minutes of the film. The rest is a fast paced ruckus oozing testosterone out of every pore. The film is a trip back to the days of intense 80's action movies with the biggest stars (figurativley and literally) making the biggest booms possible. The Expendables is all about the stars and the action, not so much about anything else. And for what the film aims to accomplish, it does a decent job at it.<br/><br/>The film is almost nonstop action, but when it does slow down it becomes pretty useless. My initial response to thinking about the story of the film is... what story? It is there, but it only serves the purpose of holding up the action and excitement, what the film is really about. What the film does try to do other than shoot stuff is develop characters. The film focuses on the relationship between Stallone and Statham's characters, but not nearly enough time is devoted to this and it ultimately becomes silly and empty. There a lot of things this film tries to do amidst the action, but it isn't able to succeed anywhere. The film eventually gets lost in itself and at times will seem to take itself too seriously, only to turn around a few minutes later and become intentionally frenetic and crazy. You can't fault the film for trying, or else it would be another empty popcorn flick, but unfortunately it's a failed attempt and I think it will be lost amongst the extensive action genre.<br/><br/>The Expendables obviously has no shortage of action, so it is hard to not be entertained somewhere along the line of this film. However, in retrospect there are only a few scenes that really stand out in the film and will probably be remembered down the line of awesome action sequences. Yet overall it's just another action film that serves as a decent diversion from the limits of physically possible feats of man. It's enough to put a grin on your face if you enjoy watching someone get blown in half back a shotgun or get decapitated by a giant shuriken knife, but it doesn't accomplish the same memorable feats that the older action film The Expendables pays homage to did. The greatest fault of the action would have to be Stallone's fetish for the shaky cam. Stallone needs to invest in a tripod for his next action exploitation, if only to reduce the amount of headaches and audience confusion. In my opinion the shaky cam is what is bringing down today's action genre, spiraling it into the ground. But that's just a personal preference of mine, and not something worth ranting about at the moment.<br/><br/>The Expendables has a great cast lineup and will undoubtedly entertain, and that's about it. Take it as it is and don't expect anything incredible. It's worth the watch if you enjoy gory entertainment with no purpose other than to divert your attention from the real world and give you a testosterone fueled good time."
"ignatiusloyala","6","1","5","29 August 2010"," Another action movies with stars
","The Expendables is like any other action movies with a star - no, stars. The story is nothing but cheesy and predictable. There're a number of lines which make you laugh (not least the ones around Arnold) but other attempts at being humorous are just pathetic. Jet Li's lines are best deleted. And generally speaking, non-English speakers don't miss much watching this. The thing I hate most is the deliberate inclusion of two chicks in a man-dominated film, who don't actually contribute anything constructive to the storyline at all. They don't even help to make any men in the movie look cool, as other action movies with chicks usually manage to do... <br/><br/>OK, so much about dissatisfaction with the story. But ultimately, it's the action that counts and I say The Expendables does OK. Despite the age of the actors, performance is solid and some action scenes are quite original. The attack made by Statham on the plane is particularly memorable. Others look vaguely familiar, although they can still pump up your adrenaline. Towards the end, the film jumped between shots too much that I started to get confused about who did what, but generally, the action part is fine.<br/><br/>For me, the movie on the whole is OK, and whether one likes this film or not I believe really depends on one's expectation. If you're lured by the number of stars the ads have you believe the film carries, be prepared to be disappointed. But if all you want is a Saturday night with popcorn and your brain shut down, watching The Expendables isn't a bad choice."

None of the dark feel you see so much of these days, but plenty of speed, bullets, fighting, and great good and bad guys all over. Very refreshing change! Hope some others in Hollywood will take a hint, and get us back to movies we can love.<br/><br/>Stallone is looking great, and the cast he put together is phenomenal. Big names, that know what the genre is really about, and they do not disappoint. Plus, the whole idea of having more seasoned actors, and not relying on some new pretty face is wonderful.

","I don't know what half the world was expecting with this film - did you honestly think Stallone and co. would produce a poignant head scratcher? No, what you were always gonna get with this was pure unleaded action from some of the greats!<br/><br/>The plot was there, although not the best. The story is that generally Stallone's men are mercenaries who are given an assignment from Bruce Willis to overthrow a Latin American dictator (for those who think this is just another ""America saves the day"" movie - the dictator is actually financed by a Yankie former CIA spook). The acting was passable, by and large, though I didn't rate Lundgren's performance too highly, but the movie in general was the epitome of awesome, undoubtedly, you don't see too many action films like this any more, so it was fantastic to get so many big names into a film with guns, muscles and cracking one-liners. <br/><br/>I only have a few criticisms, as I wasn't expecting much from a plot or acting - I was expecting the fake blood to be more convincing, and even for a boys movie, watching a woman get punched in the face by Stone Cold Steve Austin is not quite as awesome as it sounds, it was then compounded further by watching the same woman being water-boarded, which I felt was pretty unnecessary. <br/><br/>Watching Willis, Stallone and Schwarzennegger square off was magical if short lived, as well as some truly kick-ass fight scenes from all considered. <br/><br/>Anyways, other than that, it was immeasurably entertaining, and if you went in with expectations which didn't exceed good action, star quality and guns, muscles and one-liners - well you would have loved it too. <br/><br/>As a film, I give it a *** As an action movie, I give it a 9/10 for awesomeness, as I had watched Inception only a couple of nights before, it was nice to watch something where I didn't have to think too much. <br/><br/>The only action stars I would have added would have been replacing Randy Couture (who was forgettable if entertaining) with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, get Van Damme in there instead of Paul Daniels, who might as well have been cast as ""token British goon who should barely speak"", and added Vin Diesel in there somewhere too, but other than that, it was pretty much exactly what I was expecting: A reunion of fantastic old-school action stars creating an awesomely entertaining action movie."

With 7 major sets of Hollywood muscles working themselves out on the big screen, you will be buying more brawn than brain with your ticket.<br/><br/>Reckon we've just listed a long list of action heroes and to add on, there's also retired Expendables member - Tool (Mickey Rourke) who delivers all the non-lethal substance. Tool's emotional extreme close-up scene of war-inflicted psychological trauma was the only one that came from the muscular line-up to melt hearts, while the rest served to only stab hearts.<br/><br/>Stingy dialogue lines are delivered by the cast, as they are mostly one-line punchers, but a healthy dosage of humour filled some of them. The fun derives from said humour and later on, the saturated watts of firepower and violence that were a product of the strong egos. Speaking of which, Stallone did a good job in handling all the egos without having these veterans feel individualistic all in vie of screen time.<br/><br/>By having rapid cuts of intense action for the climatic royal rumble in the closing chapter.<br/><br/>The closing action scene is indeed one grand finale as Stallone leaves the best for the last with massive explosions, lethal projectile buffet, fierce close-quarter combat exchanges and everything Hollywood once threw in for classic action genre closures.<br/><br/>It wasn't a bad thing, hell yeah.<br/><br/>Stallone isn't the best directing action choreographer in the business, but he has reminded us of how veteran glory has been achieved in the past decades through classics like Rocky, Rambo, The Terminator, and Die Hard. He isn't exactly full of himself as a veteran, as he leaves space for the young blood to prove their worth with the likes of Jason Statham.<br/><br/>Amidst all the male testosterone smeared across the film, we do love how these sturdy men own little bits of big boy moments where they do share their hearts out and talk about their love affairs and comfort each other's soul. All in the name of brotherhood. Statham is seen hurling Stallone a question in the film as follows.<br/><br/>""Have you ever been rejected by a woman before?""<br/><br/>Already in the talks of a sequel as Stallone expresses an idea in mind recently, we are certain of how Hollywood works after all these years. Just like how it's mentioned in the film, ""We don't care what the business is about, the only thing you need to know is the job's real, and the money's real"".<br/><br/>If you are able to discount the story-telling hindsight and view this as a classic 80's genre reliving, Stallone brings on some raw and fierce action in blatantly painful fashion and shows that he still has it despite being at the age of 64."

An ensemble action cast making up the widest poster you've seen plastered on a bus "" Stallone , Statham , Li , Lundgren , Willis , Rourke and Schwarzenegger all in one film together "" One couldn't help wondering if there was enough celluloid to accommodate so many action stars, especially in a movie of 103 minutes or 113 minutes if you see the extended directors cut . It seems if you're going to throw everything including the kitchen sink in to a casting call you're to come up with a few problems <br/><br/>The casting isn't really a problem because despite the never ending ensemble cast a few of the names are confined to cameos . Rourke isn't involved in the action and Bruce and Arnie just appear in one scene . You can understand people going to the cinema to hear "" Yipee eye ee bad guys "" or "" I'll be back "" and coming out very disappointed but that's possibly preferable to trying to shoehorn too many characters in to an overblown film along the lines of a action adventure equivalent of THE LONGEST DAY or A BRIDGE TOO FAR . As it stands it's down to Sly and Statham to carry most of the action <br/><br/>As for the rest of the film it does have a cheap straight to DVD/cable feel to it and having Eric Roberts as the bad guy adds to this . Where the film does fall down big time is the cinematography - it really is terrible and ruins the final third which features what might have been an impressive , if OTT battle sequence , is totally undermined by the fact that it's very difficult to see who is who and who is killing who .

","The Expendables is so far one of the best action films ever made. With an awesome A-list action stars and a good script, it's such a tough action film. Great stunts and action sequences too although some of the action stars didn't have much of the action but I believe Mr. Stallone had reserved it for the second part - The Expendables 2. The best part is that most of the action scenes are done the way it should be, meaning the actors trained hard and did most of the action scenes themselves, no doubles. Plus the movie featured an array of high powered guns that are really amazing just like Terry Crews' gun which can break down a watchtower and Dolph Lundgren's gun which was showcased in the earlier part of the film where one of the villain's body was shot in half. The film is also full of explosions and the fight scenes really looks like full-contact especially the fights between Stallone and Stone Cold as well as Jet Li vs. Lundgren plus the action sequence where Stallone and Statham fought the bad guys, take them down, ground and pound to the ground! Now that's what you call ACTION! Can't wait to watch The Expendables 2 where Van Damme plays the main villain together with Scott Adkins.

If you saw the trailer and thought ""that could be cool"" you won't be disappointed. If you were hoping for Brokeback Mountain then you're the idiot, not the fans of this movie. Can't wait for the sequel, finger crossed for JCVD and Chuck Norris!!"

","A team of mercenaries is given the assignment to take out a corrupt military leader and a rogue CIA operative on a Latin American island.<br/><br/>I didn't expect too much. I love the premise of coming out with the most bad ass actors and making a film about kicking ass. That's sweet. And that is what it is. And expect nothing, because your going to get blood, explosions, and kicking ass. The movie is highly predictable and if walk in expecting an amazing story with these actors; think again and go watch something else. This film is pure popcorn-fun and I didn't want anymore. Really, honestly, there is not much more to say to this film. The action is great, everything is terribly cheesy, but what did YOU expect? Watch it with a bunch of your guy friends and not with your girlfriend. Just don't expect the better or your outta luck. 6/10."

"sddavis63","5","1","6","9 February 2011"," An Action Movie For Action Fans
","Without any hesitation at all, I have to say that this is a must see movie for any fan of action movies. It has action in abundance from beginning to end - everything from blazing shootouts to martial arts. For the most part it's a lot of fun, and often moves into overdrive in the action scenes. It even features what I thought was a decent enough performance from Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross (a name you have to love for this kind of character) who's the leader of a band of apparently special ops mercenaries. Stallone also directed to no great note, but the point of the movie was the action, which is well done. The whole thing opens with the team taking on a group of Somali pirates and leads up to a huge and frankly overdone battle between the team and a group of soldiers they've been hired to do battle with on a Caribbean island. That last battle was overlong to the point of tedious, going on for about 20 minutes with hardly a word of dialogue. That was fun for a few minutes but it should have ended a lot sooner than it did.<br/><br/>The story was strange. The team was supposedly hired to take out this Caribbean dictator and possibly the Americans who fund him. In the end, though (and actually pretty early on) the movie became a ""save the girl"" story as Barney sets out to rescue the dictator's daughter, who's actually opposed to her father and gets captured and tortured by his soldiers. That seemed to be the wrong direction to take. The movie should have perhaps held its focus on the battle against the evil dictator.<br/><br/>It's fun from an action perspective, an even features a couple of notable and uncredited cameos at the beginning from Bruce Willis as the guy who hires the team and from Arnold Schwarzenegger as a potential rival who loses out on the job. You have to love Stallone's line as Schwarzenegger walks away after losing out on the job: ""he wants to be president."" It's enjoyable enough and definitely action-packed. It didn't have enough of a consistent storyline for my liking, but real action fans will love it."
"mirwais-orbit","6","1","6","22 January 2011"," Testosterone celebration...
","Brazil was one of the filming locations of The Expendables and after that Stallone did an awful joke about Brazilians at Comic Con which had a very bad repercussion worldwide. Later he apologized for the joke inconvenience but it was too late, people here just did a massive boycott to his new action flick, even me... until now.<br/><br/>Anyway... besides all that press stuff, Stallone proves one more time with The Expendables that he can finally and officially be passing his testosterone belt to the new generation, but he knows how to make old school action movies like no one without being old fashion or out of date.<br/><br/>The movie has all the classic elements that made him the king of bloody punches and explosion in the 80's and is a lot entertaining and also nostalgic see this kind of thing nowadays when action movies have had a lot of changes thru the decades. He's still in shape, get some injuries here and there, but he's tough enough to hold it for the sake of entertainment, as another one said.<br/><br/>He also cannot be the best director or writer in the world but we have to admit that his direction and writing is more effective and superior than most of other action directors that are hitting box office since late 90's. Also it's obvious that this is the realization of a dream and a fun time he always wanted and always talked about joining together most of the old and new Hollywood action icons, a project he had in mind since the 90's but only now he could make it true.<br/><br/>All the tough ones are there, even as guest appearances like Schwarzenegger and Willis (with a few exceptions like Van Dame and Steven Seagal). Also references are there too, mainly of Stallone's classics like 'Rambo'.<br/><br/>You cannot expect anything more than explosions, gun shots, mutilations, real bad ass man fist-fight and bloody+sweat everywhere. Is a movie for the men and made for the male audience with no interesting story, just no remorse fighting and killing.<br/><br/>The movie is a clear intent to be a testosterone celebration like men drinking cheap beer in a nasty bar and there's no way to watch it in a different way.<br/><br/>Forget John Woo's lame American titles, forget Michael Bay's awful direction and all Brukheimer's terrible taste... get a beer and some undercooked meat and have some fun with Stallone once more."

","I liked the movie for what I should like this kind of movie. Guns, explosions, fights, one liners, and old heroes. It was a shame to see all of the Botox used on many of the actors trying to regain their youth. I met Stallone about 15 years ago and I know he always wanted to make an impact in Hollywood by being a triple threat. I am sure he knows he has more than done this. It seems, though, that he is trying to go out with a bang by doing stuff like this looking like this. Still, the movie was fun to watch and I took it for what it was. I also like the fact that the old men acted like old men. The young men did what the old men could have done about 15 years ago. The girl wasn't a bad actress either. I would tell anyone renting this to remember that Stallone is just an action hero and take him as such."

It's basically a homage to the dumb action movies of the 80's with bunch of well known action movies stars in it. The plot isn't anything spectacular or anything, but what lacks in plot it has some awesome action sequences although the explosions become tiring after a while. They basically used half the world's napalm in this. The problem is there is a lot of well known action stars with one real MMA fighter, but most of them just doesn't stand out what so ever. Although I seen better action movies from the 80's this one is still pretty good and if your looking for a lot of action in a movie, you will most definitely won't be disappointed.

","This film is about a bunch of professional assassins hired to kill the leader of an island nation.<br/><br/>""The Expendables"" has a very simple plot, it's so simple that it almost requires no dialog. As there is almost no dialog, screen time is filled by one fight after another. It seems that there is a fight in every scene, and there needs no reason for a fight. The action is packed, exciting and pumps adrenaline throughout the film. Yet, some violent scenes are excessively gory and unrealistic in a cartoon style, which undermines the credibility of the action. I think ""The Expendables"" delivers entertainment to action fans, which is what anyone can expect from these action stars."

Eric Roberts wasn't a fantastic bad guy though but Steve Austin was a great henchman, I even thought Bruce Willis' and Arnies cameos put a pretty good edge on the movie.

To see all of this great talent in one movie was a thrill. It was great to see Stallone, Arnold, and Bruce on the screen for the first time ever. It was like watching a piece of history. The fight scenes were incredible. My personal favorite was between Randy Couture and Steve Austin. Somewhere former three time WWE Champion and current UFC Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar had to be smiling. Some of the fight scenes were a little too gory at times for me personally, but I guess for a war movie that they worked. Van Damme and Seagal should have signed on for this, but I guess their happy being reduced to straight-to-DVD stars now. I also would have liked to have seen more of Charisma Carpenter. I liked that little subplot with Jason Statham, especially when he kicked that guy's ass for smacking her around. I can't wait for the sequel."

","I'm a girl. I love deep movies. The Expendables is neither a ""girl"" movie, nor deep, but I enjoyed it very, very much. <br/><br/>I grew up in the 90s when action movies were the thing. My dad used to rent movies and we'd watch them together. In the resent years Hollywood has been lacking the pure, testosterone loaded, blood sprinkling action movies. First time I saw the trailer of The Expendables I knew this movie would be exactly that - a pretty predictable story line, not that deep of a dialogue and lots and lots of bullets, guns, knives, fights and blood. It didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The Expendables brought back memories from my childhood, as well as a well-spend money and time. It was packed with actors I remember from my childhood, it had funny moments and the bickering scene between Mr. Stallone and Mr. Schwarzenegger was just priceless. If you miss how movies were made a few decades ago, I strongly recommend this movie."

Genuinely the storyline or lack of it does not matter a jot, instead you are entertained by the comical quips and the relationship between the characters which really works!

I don't know why people expect more than that, because they didn't cast De Niro, Pacino or DeCaprio so don't expect this film to be thick on plot. they cast action stars in this film who are known for their charisma and ass kicking... not for their acting<br/><br/>I personally think every characters had their own moment to shine, the one person that really caught my attention was Dolph Lundgren , he really played a big bad ass in this film even though he wasn't in the final showdown , his character was the most memorable.

","I had the action and the thrills I wanted, but since i am a fan of a few of the actors I wanted much more.<br/><br/>I think Stallone, did such a good job on Rambo 4 that my expectations were too high. <br/><br/>Now as a Rambo 4 fan, these are the 1 things that was better in Rambo 4 and less good in ""The Expendables"".<br/><br/>1. A lot of the blood in""The Expendables"" was CGI. In Rambo 4 it was much more splashy and the blood seemed real. I have nothing against CGIs when they do not look like a computer cartoon in the movie, in many moments in ""The Expendables"" the blood looks very computerish.<br/><br/>Two things I was expecting that didn't live up to my expectation.<br/><br/>The fight between Dolph and Li is lot less mythical then I expected. I was expecting Bruce Lee VS Chuck Norris part 2. On the reverse side I like the twist and the consequences of this combat.<br/><br/>The rest of the fights and this one are very good but the difference between Li and Lundgren VS the rest of the cast, minus Gary Daniels and Randy Couture, is that they are Martial legends.<br/><br/>In my opinion, if you put them in the ring the expectation are bigger then Stallone VS Austin, that ends being a better looking fight scene.<br/><br/>3. I feel that the team was too sporadic, for Example in the film ""The Predator"", they manage to keep the audience focused on the team. I was expecting a full adventure with these characters. It's not that the camaraderie is less good, it's just that in the beginning you have quite a few scenes that focuses on Stallone and Statham. Those have scenes have all the elements to make them great except you miss the rest of the team. A few walkie-talkie moments with the rest of the guys and a few jokes would have done it. Still when they are together it's great.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie is fun, the entire cast is good, the story is great and I am looking forward for the sequel."

I was expecting a better version of the last Rambo but it was definitely not an improvement. The cast, as stellar as it is, worked more as supporting character where as Stallone and Statham acted as the main characters of the film. Overall, this film has a lack of action, poor CGI at times and not enough blood and gore that graced our eyes in Rambo.

Just go in, buy your popcorn, large fountain drink, a couple of hotdogs, maybe a tray of nachos, and several assorted boxes of candy, and eat your comfort food and enjoy the violence and the tough guy talk—which at times, is undecipherable (i.e. Stallone).

If you're going there for story or clever dialogue or for research on rocket science, don't do itjust don't do it. Heard that Van Dam was offered a role but the role he was offered wasn't big enough for him. Too bad, he should have done it, it's not like Willis or Arnold had a big role, but they had the funniest scene in the movie. Maybe they'll have a sequel and ol' Claude will show up.

","I hated this movie. I really did. Then, why give it 3 stars? Well, the answer is very simple. First of all because I like Stallone. He is the Keith Richards of the cinema, faithful to his stile and his clichés, doing his stuff as it pleases him. Only for that he deserves more than one star. If you like only action and explosions you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>The other reason is because I had a rotten cinematographic month, where the movies I watched got worse and worse and worse to the point of desperation. Let's see. There was Salt, Iron Man 2, The Karate Kid (remake), Predators and Machete. They were all worse than a frozen Cheeseburger on a rainy day. IMDb had to start supplying minus stars so it would be possible classifying that vomiting nullity. So, compared to that, ""The Expendables"", a brain-dead imbecility of a movie, seemed to be OK.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I was scratching my head, wondering why they do it? Why are movies becoming what they are becoming, absolutely dumb, shallow, empty, superficial, wit free? I guess I know why. The problem is not the movies. The problem is the average movie fans, who are becoming everything I just mentioned above. So, Hollywood is just adapting. Clever!"
"go2dean","9","1","7","6 September 2010"," That's What I Call ""An Action Movie""
","For those who b-rated this movie, it's apparent that what we call An Action Movie these days, is achieved more by CGI. This film takes us back to the days when business was literally BOOMING! The story line (for those who did not understand it) was a well thought out approach to what really takes place in the dark halls of the CID and the Intelligence Agency. The Garza character was a Noriaga prototype. However the interesting twist was Garza having to choose between money and power vs. the love of his daughter. This was a great element of conflict in the story. There were other small elements that merely gave you a glimpse into the lives of each character. So what else could you ask for? The fight scenes where superlative, and the weaponry was outstanding. Stallone has once again stumbled upon yet another potential franchise that could be good for 1 or 2 more films. In retrospect, Van Damme & Seagal would not have been a good fit for this project. I really liked each actor in their respective roles, even ""Stone-Cold"" as a bad guy & Lungren as a drugged-out psycho. Sly still has ""The Eye Of The Tiger""."
"revelinchaos","6","1","7","1 September 2010"," This movie is... expendable.
","I believe that the most notable characteristic of this movie can be summarized by the poster on the left: a list of 'big' names and known faces, all mixed up together regardless of their actual role and its (ir)relevance to the 'story'. To be more clear, Willis plays an insignificant cameo of some minutes, Rourke has a very minor role, ""Stone Cold"" has a minor role AND is a 'bad guy', almost same thing for Lundgren, etc, etc. You could also see this as an example of deceptive advertising, in a sense: throwing in big names to have some people say ""wow! what a cast! I gotta watch this!"". Of course, having big names in a movie would be a good thing, if only the actors that bear those names were given a meaningful role and the chance(/ability?) to play it. Of all the actors cited in that list, only Stallone, Statham an (oddly enough) Li play what one might call 'main' roles, and the first two are the ones who actually have some lines of dialog too. Yes, this is an action movie, not a drama, but I don't believe this can be a justification for ridiculously ill developed plot and characters (e.g. the 'apex' of character development this movie reaches is well exemplified by two ludicrously sketchy sequences that involve Statham and Mrs. Carpenter), and for fast paced action that sadly doesn't 'connect' in order to form a linear and accomplished plot sequence. How are Stallone and 'his squad' organized? Who are they, and what's their background? What's the deal with the bad guys? What are they doing? Who the hell is Willis supposed to be and why/how does he contract these guys? And so on, and on. (Incidentally, the scene with Willis and *won't spoil this 'surprise'* is for some reason one of the most self-indulging and 'least-funny-while-trying-too-hard-to-be' I've seen recently)<br/><br/>The movie does almost nothing in order to create a sense of 'perspective' and purpose to help the viewer relate to what's going on and feel intrigued by it. It's all about martial arts, weapons and explosions, but if this is all one is entitled to expect from an action movie, then, hell, we already have dozens of Seagal and Van Damme's flicks out there that do exactly the same things without all the 'glittering stars' Stallone could draw upon.<br/><br/>As the saying goes: All that glitters...<br/><br/>6/10"

","Despite the beefy, leathery exterior that has defined him as world-class neck-breaker but nowhere close to a serious thespian, Sylvester Stallone may be a bit more astute (in terms of cinematic technique and his own roller-coaster celebrity status) than I have given him credit for. On one hand, ""The Expendables"" is a killer title for a film that is as badass as its world-class, neck-breaking cast; on the other hand, that very title seems to be winking back at its built-in, action-hungry audience -- as if daring us to take a leap of faith that will make us believe that misbegotten stars of yesteryear, many of whom have floundered in the direct-to-video action ghetto, still have the ability to leave us in awe of their prowess (both dramatically and physically). It's a mighty gamble that Stallone (as director and co-writer) takes to delirious extremes; the result is both a thrilling, bloody action showcase and a much smoother directorial outing (despite the expected deluge of explosions and bullet-riddled bodies) than 2008's barnstorming ""Rambo."" The plot itself doesn't stray far from the star's favored tropes: South American dictator (""Dexter""'s David Zayas) puppeteered by rogue CIA toady (a deliciously oily Eric Roberts) who holds a small island territory in a grip of fear; the heart-of-gold daughter who defects to help The Good Guys and convinces our jaded hero that some things ARE worth fighting for; the general lustful attention to the facets of fun and dirty mayhem. The script is peppered with in-jokes and knowing winks (some of them quite literal), and manages to balance the lighter moments with the more predictable excesses (there is even a fantastic scene where Mickey Rourke -- as the team's haunted go-to guy -- relays a wrenching monologue about the moment when his ""soul turned black""). In a summer that has been sadly void of creativity and anything resembling a fresh idea, Stallone returns the action faithful to 1985 -- and re-affirms cinematic testosterone in the process. ""The Expendables"" is anything but."

It contains a story just thin enough to carry it all, a large can of well known and somewhat less known actors from the action scene of the old and current days and an insane amount of pyrotechnics. It takes a short time to build a backing story and introduce some of the characters and then moves on and starts an action sequence and since this sequence doesn't really end until the ending credits for the film rolls by it does this fairly decently.<br/><br/>Pity though that most of the names on the film poster are no more than a marketing stunt.

Stallone is the leader of this blood pack mercenaries, that kills without blinking, next we have Jason Statham the master of knifes, he kills all guys, in ways we never dream of, jet Li is also kicking hard and shooting fast, has a great fight with Dolph, like David and Golias, we got terry crews with the most powerful shotgun in the world the AA-12, that erases all enemy's like the flames of hell, we got Mickey Rourke has Tool a great man also, as a scene with Stallone very intense, were they cry... great actor, it's fantastic Dolph Lundgren as the anti-hero is a crazy man,like a Junky but on adrenaline, that kills, and kills, randy couture has a dream fight with Steve Austin that was magnificent Eric Roberts as the main bad guy was cool, and David was alright the girls specially Giselle Itié, i already knew from soap operas, was great has Sandra,she embraces the character so good, it's great and charisma carpenter it's a bomb, what a woman, in overall i't's the best action movie of the year, i've just wished that Stallone make more of these, a trilogy maybe, it's 80's all the way baby. i hope Arnold and Willis to play more in the sequel, not only for 4 minutes, with them in the whole movie will be the expendables 2 apocalypse, just hope to see more names. in the sequel, like chuck Norris, Steven Seagal, Michael Jai White, Wesley snipes or Van Damme. i will go to the theaters soon again to see once again the expendables, one time it's not enough, and i hope that the blue-ray could have an extended cut, so i'm buying it anyway long live the 80's.

"Troy_Campbell","3","1","10","13 August 2010"," A slow start but an almighty bang of a finale.
","Late last year when I was reading a movie magazine in bed I came across a small article that took me by surprise. Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Austin, Rourke... they were all going to appear in an action blockbuster together! And Arnie and Willis were earmarked for cameos! I was so overwhelmed with excitement and adrenaline I immediately went to my bathroom mirror and started flexing my muscles. With the very quick realisation that my bulging biceps were perhaps imaginative, I sulked back to bed, but my enthusiasm for The Expendables couldn't be dampened.<br/><br/>Fast forward 10 months and the action extravaganza is here. Only, it's not quite the extravaganza I was hoping for. There were some flaws I expected before walking into the cinema – a weak excuse for plot development, cringe-worthy dialogue and fairly ordinary acting largely thanks to Mr Lundgren – however the faults don't stop there. Most disappointingly the cast, with the exception of Statham and Couture, are almost completely devoid of charisma. Even the eagerly-awaited encounter between Sly, Arnie and Brucey fizzles away into blandness thanks to the trio metaphorically winking so hard at the camera. As for the main man, Stallone may want to think about hanging up the ol' action boots. It's not for lack of trying, his ambition to match the younger blokes is obvious, however he simply just doesn't have it anymore.<br/><br/>The action itself can be reviewed in two parts: the final act and everything that comes before it. Up until the hour mark the set-pieces are rather mundane. Even a duel between Lundgren and Li – a match-up that should've been a highlight – lacks oomph, whilst the opening is as dreary as anything you would find in the lowest standard of action flick. Thankfully the last 30 minutes nearly redeems the whole film. There's more blood, guts, explosions, knife-throwing and gun-fights than you could poke a rocket-launcher at. Yet the best part is the brutal, bone-crunching hand-to-hand melees that feature Stallone vs Austin, Couture vs Austin and Li vs two-dozen random guys. If there was an action heaven, this last act is what it would look like.<br/><br/>After an extremely slow start The Expendables comes home with an almighty bang of a finale that is worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","Don't try to over-think or over-analyze this movie. It's an excuse to get all the great action stars together and blow stuff up - A lot. It contains just enough of a thin plot to tell a cohesive story. The love story sub-plot with Stallone is just enough to provide a sense of motivation for the main character, other than being strictly mercenary. And there is just enough humor to lighten the mood between gun fights, car/plane chases, and big explosions. Eric Roberts as the bad guy was a brilliant choice, as he never takes himself too seriously, so you feel okay rooting against him but you never quite come to hate him. I do feel, despite the R rating, that the movie pulled it's punches (sorry) with the language and other adult content. If you're going to make a big budget R rated action movie explosion-fest, then go all out with it! It's worth seeing, but not on a date. Get the guys together, go out for steaks and beers, then sit back and enjoy."
"Lomedin","6","1","11","2 May 2011"," Fun movie to watch
","From the first minutes of this film, with heads blowing and bodies chopped in half, you know what you are going to find for the next 90 minutes. The Expendables, directed by Stallone, follows the same principles of the Rambo franchise: kill the bad guys, save the good people, make explode as many soldiers as possible. And it works. 100% action, it's nice to see such number of classic legends working together (even if Bruce Willis and Arnie are only on screen for a couple of minutes). It's interesting to see how, for some reason, Jet Li is some sort of ""not there yet"" professional, and he seems to need someone to save/help him all the time. Stallone adds also a lil of emotional bits (as well in the vein of Rambo). Nothing that you big guys cannot cope with, since this is done in a manner that doesn't feel out of place or corny. You will be kicking ass again next minute. The bottom line, this is a very fun film to watch without any expectations but pure violence trying to be disguised as a way rather than a meaning. I don't think I need to say this, but don't be looking for an original plot nor anything similar. As I said, just an entertaining piece to have a laugh with while drinking with the lads."

","I am glad I saw this movie on a Saturday afternoon. That is when I am in the mood to see an action movie. In the 1970's Saturday afternoons was when I would see a Bruce Lee or Charles Bronson movie.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is not only the star and director of ""The Expendables"" but he is also one of the writers. My guess is that Stallone was responsible for all the clever lines, because he has been good with that in the Rocky movies. The dialog written for Jet Li in this film is actually a surprise. It is far different from any dialog given to Jet Li before.<br/><br/>Two years ago, Eric Roberts did great as a crime boss in ""The Dark Knight."" Roberts does an even better job as the boss of the bad guys in ""The Expendables"".<br/><br/>The fight scenes in this movie are very well done. Explosions and gunfire are plentiful, but it is not the sort of action that I care to watch. Still, for a Saturday afternoon, ""The Expendables"" is a very good choice."
"montera_iulian","6","1","11","13 August 2010"," It has explosions, fist-fights, knifes, big guns and some of the greatest action legends but still it's the typical ""Just when"" type of movie...
","I just came from the premiere of The Expendables and I must say one thing: ""DAMN, the movie was short!"". Expendables is exactly what I expected. Some of the biggest stars from the best action-movies ever made thrown in together in a great non-stop action movie. It was awesome as the typical ""dude"" would say.<br/><br/>Expendables shares the story of a group of mercenaries that have no boundaries when lots of money are mixed up in certain situations. All things cool before emotions are caught up in the game (as always). But leave that away for a second and think about all the characters in the movie. Each one of them was a pure bad-ass: Stallone is the smart guy with the plan and the guns, Statham was a knife-throwing machine same as Rourke, Couture and Li are skilled in close-combat techniques, Crews deals with the big guns and Lundgre, well.... Lundgren it's kind of the bad-ass of the bad-asses. He was just hilarious but a killing machine also (I still laugh at his first appearance or at his ""insect"" scene, the way he delivered that line was gold). Though the main characters are handled well I was disappointed in throwing Arnold in this movie. His character does not make any sense to the story whatsoever. It's just thrown there to make people realize that he played in this movie even if you forget about him 5 minutes later. Another character which had a lot of potential since it was so sarcastic and funny was Bruce's ""Mr. Church"". As hilarious as some of the characters were they all looked like some ""steroid-machines"" besides Jet Li and I hate to say it but some of them got low time on camera while others appeared constantly. The villains portrayed by Eric Roberts and his ""monkey-bodyguard"" Steve Austin balanced the movie pretty well till the moment you realize you just witnessed a ""genocide"" made by the hands of just five bone-breakers.<br/><br/>The action in the movie is intense and there is a very good choreography used in the close-combat scenes. But with all these aspects of a great action-movie I encountered a big problem since the beginning of the movie. The story is just too flat, it looks too much like they could've named the movie ""The Expectables"" instead of ""The Expendables"". Not too mention that even if you have a vibe of the 80's and 90's action movies you lose yourself into a big ""just when"" type of movie. What is a ""just when"" movie? It's when something bad is so close to happening but it is interrupted by the good guys. It's just too much of a cliché. Each and every single scene dealt with the ""just when"" aspect. This is where I started to drop points heavily for this movie. Stallone could have come up with a fresh story even of he wanted to keep things old-school, but I guess brains really do the difference in this case. Another thing I was kind of dazzled were the explosions which were so good but too god damn many. I mean, they came over a island to ""save"" it and they blew like half of it. You got at least 20 minutes of things blowing up. You could hear Stallone each minute: ""Hey, blow up the mansion"", ""Hey, blow up the sewers"", ""Hey blow up that truck"", ""Hey, throw some grenades in those tents""... I mean, those explosions were solid made but still it was just ridiculous...<br/><br/>As far as the execution, like I said, the effects were great (the explosions, the splattered blood or the collapsing building). The disappointing thing with the cinematography was that some of the handled-camera shots were kind of shaky and disturbing to watch. The problem with the score seems to me actually a little bit weird since I liked more the old-beer-songs instead of the composed one which didn't quite match all the scenes. I think I said enough about this movie. I think it's the best straight-action movie this year, I think the movie delivers good entertainment but I also think there was a laaaargeee space for improvements since it had such a potential. As far as the talks behind a sequel, I would like to see one since I enjoyed the movie and it deserved the money payed for but I would also like to see a better story because this one simply (if I can be harsh) sucked, the comic lines being actually the best thing out of it."

","In The Expendables, Sylvester Stallone, Jason Stratham and all the other inexplicably popular charisma vacuums in the action movie industry go blow up some stuff, fight a big baddie and... that's it. I love action films but I don't automatically love all of them, and although this isn't a terrible movie and does offer some old school fun, it does feel rather soulless and lacks charisma. With explosions galore, there's plenty of entertain action junkies and there are a few inspired moments and high octane stupidity. In one of the great good scenes in bad movies, Mickey Rourke actually acts and delivers a powerful speech on a war he once thought in. However, none of the others are particularly great. Sylvester Stallone is particular has trouble changing his facial expression even once. His direction is acceptable, but also ugly and artificial at times. I have no problem with paying tribute to action films, but it'd be nice if it wasn't with the personality, depth and warmth of a Lord Of The Rings orc.<br/><br/>The script is genuinely awful and doesn't have another humour for a film of this kind. A lot of the time it's very hard to even work out what's going on since the light is so poor. In general, the film just barrels on from one loud incomprehensible set piece to the next and even though it's meant to be a tribute to old school action it doesn't even feel that light or over the top a lot of the time and feels too cowardly to actually hit hard. When people talk about loud and noisy action garbage this is the sort of thing they are talking about. While I don't agree with those who dislike action movies, they have a strong piece of evidence here. It's a moderately watchable film and at times I was enjoying it but since the film is like a zombie walking through a graveyard of action clichés, this could be mistaken for some awful flick about zombie action heroes. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis both appear, but sadly they're reduced to cameos. The Expendables 2 sounds OK, but I shudder to think of The Expendables 3 which is apparently even worse.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Let's get one thing out of the way immediately; if you look at a blu ray cover and see Sly Stallone, Jason Statham and Steve Austin on it, it's a sure-fire thing you know exactly what you are getting when you stick the disk in.<br/><br/>This is not Pride & Prejudice, nor is it Blade Runner. What it is is exactly what it suggests on the cover; a cracking hour and a half of explosions, fisticuffs and shoot-outs featuring an amazing ensemble of many of the 80s finest action heroes plus more recent ones like Jet Li and aforementioned Statham.<br/><br/>While nowhere near as prolific a director as he is actor, Sylvester Stallone has nevertheless proved himself many times as extremely effective shouting 'action' as he is likewise saying 'Adrian'.<br/><br/>With previous credits including 3 of the Rocky movies, plus the Rambo remake, Stallone is no slouch when it comes to having an eye for a good action movie. He has made a career of pretending to be quite dim when the man is clearly a lot brighter than many give him credit for, and that is evident again in Expendables.<br/><br/>The story, a flimsy load of nonsense, is just a vehicle in this movie to travel from one explosive action scene to another, and quite simply it works brilliantly. The fights are bone-crunchingly satisfying, the shootouts crazily hectic and the explosions so over the top you'll smile and giggle like a kid reliving these kinds of moments from Hollywood's past.<br/><br/>What IS surprising is the level of acting and characterisation - while in places the voice clarity is very poor, nevertheless the narrative in terms of the protagonists is actually half decent, and the viewer genuinely wants Sly and his chums to succeed. A little touch of class was casting Mickey Rourke and his brief monologue in the middle works because you buy him - we saw him in the Wrestler as a hopeless case and he achieves it here too. Mainly because while the words are fake, the emotion is real given Rourke has hardly had an easy ride.<br/><br/>But getting back to why we watch it, the explosions, the fights, and the shootouts - they're compelling, engaging, well staged and the humour which punctuates them is used perfectly. The one-liners here, including the multitude of in-jokes and nostalgic references are delivered with aplomb.<br/><br/>With Stallone's fun-filled direction and an excellent cast who do their jobs very well indeed, this is a very enjoyable piece of brainless entertainment.<br/><br/>I do agree with another review which pointed out the one flaw which was the unconvincing CGI sequences which were obviously digital. They did rather blot some shots. That aside there's really little to complain about here.<br/><br/>Just don't expect The Shawshank Redemption."

","Expendables was not exactly my favorite but I would have to say that for the most part it was a decent action movie. With the amount of actors that were cast in this movie that had huge success in other franchises it was a little bit of a disappointment for me to see this movie at the level it was. I would have expected better.<br/><br/>That being said, there are a few scenes that I found pretty good. Incidentally these are the most action packed scenes of the entire movie. Go figure.<br/><br/>The first scene I liked was when Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) fly down to Vilena, an island in the Gulf of Mexico (fictional, of course). They are doing reconnaissance for a job to take out the dictator of the island. Ross and Christmas witness local soldiers terrorizing the citizens of the island and being directed by James Munroe (Eric Roberts) and Paine (Steve Austin). The best part of the whole scene is when Ross and Christmas escape the island, but end up taking out the dock area they landed their plane. The do this, Christmas first fires Browning M2 Aircraft machine guns quad-mounted into the nose of the plane. Then fuel is dumped on the dock, dousing the remaining soldiers and Munroe and Paine, Christmas then fires a M8 Flare Pistol at the dock to ignite the fuel.<br/><br/>The next scene I liked was when Christmas gets home he goes over to his girlfriend's house only to find that she, Lacy (Charisma Carpenter) is seeing another guy. Lacy explains that she only moved on because even when Christmas was home he wasn't really home, and that she really didn't know him. But the best scene for this little triangle is when Christmas goes to Lacy's house and discovers that her boyfriend, Paul (Hank Amos), has hit Lacy. Christmas and Lacy get on his motorcycle to go have a chat with Paul. Paul is playing basketball with a five or six other guys when Lacy and Christmas show up. Christmas takes out every single one of them, leaving them alive, but tells Paul that the next time he comes near Lacy and lays a hand on her he will deflate all of Paul's balls.<br/><br/>The best scene by far is the scene in which Ross and Christmas, along with the other members of their mercenary force, storm the President's Palace on Vilena. They are doing this to take out the dictator, General Garza (David Zayas), as well as Munroe and Paine. They are also trying to rescue Sandra (Giselle Itie'), General Garza's daughter. Near the end of the scene Munroe has a gun pointed at Sandra and he asks Ross why he was coming after him; Ross answers that he was coming for the girl not him, and then shoots Munroe several times before Christmas throws a knife through his chest.<br/><br/>Another great scene is the chase scene through the city the Expendables live in. I hate that the 1955 Ford 100 truck that Barney Ross was driving got destroyed, I like older vehicles like that one. The fight between Yin Yang (Jet Li) and Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) at the end of this chase scene was pretty cool.<br/><br/>I think I named all the headliners. Oh wait! I forgot Bruce Willis as Church and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench, they weren't in the movie for very long, a total of about 7 or 8 minutes.<br/><br/>Anyway, this could have been a hell of a lot better. The graphics, especially the blood splatter from gun shot wounds, was exaggerated; probably to allow for better visual effect, but it looked fake. I guess that was the point. A lot of the weapons were pretty cool. I like the weapon that Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) used. Sorry, I forgot a headliner.<br/><br/>The script was OK. Tool's (Mickey Rourke) story of being in Bosnia (?) was touching, especially when he started to get choked up.<br/><br/>Anyway, I give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars. It could have been way better."

It is also aware of itself as a film: the dialogue makes the viewer understand that the actors are in a movie and not taking anything seriously which wasn't the right decision in my mind because it weakened the film too much: it became too dull and lacked any dramatic impact as I knew everything wasn't happening ""for real"" and since this film isn't art: it's soundtrack and visuals aren't artsy but are simple action tropes, thus it cannot be understood as art but only as an action movie that depends on tension to create a situation."
"piratecannon","5","0","1","26 December 2012"," Ka-Boom!
","Billed as a reunion of the most stellar action heroes of our age, The Expendables is uber-violent, uber-loud, and uber-stupid.<br/><br/>We can't really fault Stallone and company though, can we? After all, these guys made their careers by starring in movies that are light on plot (with a few exceptions, of course) and heavy on ammunition/bone- breaking. Still, their previous efforts were, to a certain degree, effortlessly charming. With this most recent blow-em-up, the stars of the show—namely Stallone and Statham—do manage to bring some personality to an otherwise meat-headed testosterone-fest, but the feeling that it was made simply as a cash-grab to try and reel in fans of '80s action movies is undeniable.<br/><br/>One could certainly argue that The Expendables is as cheesy as it is for a reason—I mean, what better way to pay homage to the often ridiculous, bullet-ridden actioners of yesteryear? Again, though, things here feel a little too forced, and the painfully stilted dialogue often elicits more unintended wincing than it does chuckles. There's also the sense that what we're witnessing is a tad bit I don't know sad. Like so many aging actors participating in revitalized franchises that ended decades ago, there's a somewhat clumsy ""last hurrah"" tone that is, quite frankly, kind of depressing.<br/><br/>None of this means the movie is a total flop, however. As was demonstrated in Rambo's most recent reincarnation, Stallone has a knack for crafting some of the most over-the-top (i.e., gory) deaths that have come along in quite a while. It's nice to see an action film maintain an unapologetic demeanor from start to finish, and this is something that a good portion of the choppy, fast-editing directors of contemporary Hollywood could learn from.<br/><br/>Despite its successes, the sheer idiocy of the story dulls the welcome edge The Expendables is able to forge. So, instead of a well-made homage, we get a movie that's more ""decorative shell"" than ""gutsy innards.""<br/><br/>Kind of ironic, isn't it?"
"ebiros2","7","0","3","19 December 2012"," Return of Stallone
","I'm glad to see Silvester Stallone in any movie, but I was wondering what happened to him after making Rambo 4. He's back with an all star cast of A list action movie actors in this movie. It's almost like Stallone's version of the Avengers. Only he would have the clout to pull something like this off. <br/><br/>At first when you see the list of actors, this is going to be a really exciting movie. Each of the actors are good on their own, and it's hoped that together they'd be outrageous. This doesn't happen though because the script is somewhat old fashioned. If this movie was made in the '80s, it would have been good, but in the 21st century, it's just more of the same. Sly really needs to modernize his concept of how an action movie could be. The bad guys wasn't up to par with the heros either. The Rock music, both on this and part 2 was really old fashioned. <br/><br/>This movie would have benefited if it borrowed some ideas from the Magnificent Seven. In that movie, each of the characters were well fleshed out, and functioned as a team, but also interesting to watch as individuals. These guys weren't interesting as a team or individuals. <br/><br/>Visually the movie was really good. Just for that it's worth the watch. <br/><br/>So a movie that could have been epic more or less ended up being just an above average movie. I think the series has lot of potential, so I hope they'd make a third installment that's totally over the top."

","It's funny when the trailers, posters and other movie-advertisements make a film look cornier than it actually is. Stallone's 2012 action/adventure—though not perfect, but very entertaining—falls into this category. A tight-knit group of mercenaries go to Vilena to stop an evil ex-CIA officer (Roberts) who is using a powerful general (Zayas) as a puppet to dictate the small helpless island. The setting, design, style and tone of the film are all superb; and while the action is above-par, it gets a bit cartoonish and fails to be mind-blowing. While the acting and choice of casting is exceptional, the characters are either cliché, hypocritical or both—Zayas seems to be the only actor amongst the large ensemble that brings to life a character convincingly conflicted and three-dimensional. The amount of characters is completely unnecessary, with most of them lacking any purpose—even Mickey Rourke can't seem to earn his keep despite having a terrific monologue mid-film. While the pros outweigh the cons, there are a couple of unacceptable missteps in this blockbuster homage. Have fun watching, because that's all it really offers and that's not a bad thing **½ (out of four)"

"tomgillespie2002","6","0","1","27 May 2012"," With such genuine heart, impossible not to like
","Following the recent re-vists of two of his most iconic characters, John Rambo and Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone continued his oddly touching nostalgia trip to the heydey of his career with this homage to the glory days of the action film, the 1980's and the early 1990's. It was a time where anything from a kidnapped daughter to the overhauling of a military dictator could be solved by removing your upper clothes, adding a touch of oil, and finding the biggest guns you can get your hands on, and possibly the only era that would have ever allowed the likes of Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris to become movie stars. Of course, Stallone was one of the big three that formed Planet Hollywood (along with Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger) and was one of the undisputed stars of the time, but with the problem of age (and lack of acting ability) creeping up with him, Stallone's roles have become thin of late. It seemed the perfect time to remind us just why people loved him, by directing this balls-out love love letter to carnage, and, like Rocky Balboa (2006), it's actually pretty good.<br/><br/>The Expendables, a group of bikers and mercenaries, are sent by the mysterious 'Mr. Church' (Bruce Willis) to overthrow the dictator of Vilena. The groups' leader, Barney Ross (Stallone), and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) travel for research, and discover that the country's dictator, General Garza (David Zayas) is merely a controlled figurehead for ex-CIA operative James Munroe (Eric Roberts). Things quickly get out of hand, but the two manage to escape amidst an array of explosions. Falling for their informer Sandra (Gisele Itie), who also happens to be Garza's daughter, Ross decides to return to finish the job, and this time taking martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li), gun-nut Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), and bomb expert Toll Road (Randy Couture). But ex-Expendable Gunnar (Dolph Lundgren) - recently dispensed for almost hanging a captive on a previous mission and for drug use - travels to Vilena to work for Munroe.<br/><br/>Anyone going into this film wanting or expecting an engrossing storyline, a witty script, or anything resembling character development, will be sorely disappointed. This is 100% dedicated to gun porn, explosions, and homoerotic exchanges, precisely the thing that the early films of Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Jean-Claude Van Damme were known and loved for. What it does have however, is a lot of heart. Stallone is undoubtedly a romantic, and he has formed a cast full of old-school action stars (Mickey Rourke has en extended cameo as Tool, and Schwarzenegger briefly appears in a film that made me oddly giddy), as well as some of the new faces of straight-to-video, sorry, DVD (wrestler Steve Austin also appears as Munroe's head grunt Paine).<br/><br/>However, The Expendables seems to suffer most from the thing that noticeably plagues modern action films, and that is badly filmed and confusing action scenes. Rather than actually showing the fighting (and there are many here that deserve better, namely Jet Li), they fill the screen with a mixture of blurs, shaky hand-held camera-work, and rapid editing. It seems that Stallone thinks that as long as the audiences' eyes are busy, regardless as to whether they know what it happening, then they will be happy. And a lot of the macho talk gets quite tiresome quickly, and as token black guy Hale Caesar talks about his gun like it is a girl in that ""hell ye-ha!"" sort-of-way, the film came across as nothing more than a walking erection.<br/><br/>Yet with a film put together with such genuine heart, I found it impossible not to like, and it certainly transported me back to my childhood when the action wave was still in full flow, and I was obsessed with the likes of Commando (1985). I'm pleased that a sequel is also not far off, and the added casting of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris, as well as an extended role for Schwarzenegger (who now has time for acting given his political career has thankfully ended), has me obviously excited.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","So (Stallone) wanted to work. (Stallone) wanted to remake The Seven Samurai as violent mercenaries. (Stallone) wanted to pay a tribute to the 1980s; its coarse feel, legendary fistfights, no CGI, and soldiers of fortune having adventures in tropical countries. Well, (Stallone) got all of that, but missed other things.<br/><br/>Some points bewitched me, like: The touch of the 50s car; summarizing the whole matter of an old yet metal tough persona. The idea of modern Seven Samurai (who don't die for the sequel!). The deep intention to embody the conflict as a war between a noble worrier, (Stallone), and a black picture of him that he's afraid of turning into someday, (Eric Roberts). The endless wicked one-liners. The cool funny names (Hale Caesar, Toll Road, Yin Yang, Christmas, Barney, Gunner, Mr. Church..). The distinct armlet scene. And if you're hungry for some explosions, the climactic sequence is designed for making you more than full!<br/><br/>On the other hand.. the script; it's almost stupid. In every Seven Samurai version, one of the big secrets of its beauty remains in the variety of the characters of the Seven Samurai themselves. This time, underdeveloped is the main theme! For little instance, (Randy Couture) has no character, no dialogue, no deeds but hitting some dude in the last 10 minutes! Look at the dictator as well. There was a try to make a character out of him but failed. I hated the moment of (Roberts) killing the dictator among all the latter's army; How come for god's sake?!! However, it's naught compared to the moment when the leads agree, suddenly, to sacrifice their own lives since (Stallone) wanted to go back because he loved the girl's drawing??? I was eating myself out of rage during the moment of ""We'll die for you man, but don't ask us twice!"" This is not macho reaction, this is frank idiocy!<br/><br/>Clearly that script had no time for anything. Therefore, while watching the last big fight, after being away from understanding the tragedy of one nation and one public, you must feel absurd and mindless. Now making a homage to the 1980s action movies is one thing, and tracking down their bad points is totally another!<br/><br/>Then, (Stallone)' face! It reminded me with a line said by (Walter Matthau) in (The Odd Couple II): ""I'm not as old as I look. I had this plastic surgery done recently, and the quack doctor botched it up!!"" (Stallone) must have injected himself with a gallon of botox, so he looked 1) As someone who looks old AND having a botched up plastic surgery! 2) Unable to act (while he happens to be originally Mr. Sylvester-the unable to act-Stallone!). And 3) an ugly freak with dented eyebrows and about-to-drop eyeballs. In brief, he was creepy and pathetic like a C Horror movie's monster! Why he didn't let his wrinkles show up; it's obvious that he, as well as his character, is OLD!<br/><br/>The rest of the cast wasn't less bad. How come that a respectable critic said that (Mickey Rourke)'s crying scene was ""serious acting""? It's well written yes, but his face was melting for God's sake! (Terry Crews) is no peer to (Wesley Snipes) who was the first choice for (Caesar) character. (Dolph Lundgren) was terrible except while he's fighting. (Schwarzenegger) was only a name, used in an inside joke scene, so concerning an action; sure we waited for more. True that (Roberts) was lively; pumping some blood to the movie's acting, but still (Jason Statham) was the one who stole the show. Aside from not having a botox bulimia, (Statham) was lucky enough to have the closest thing to a ""character"" around!<br/><br/>Where the 80s millions budget did go? I'll tell you: The explosions. The thing is they went on and on and on at the end, as if (Stallone) was compensating the movie's drama by them. Speaking about annoyance, the ""mince"" violent is. (Willis)'s remark at the church, added by him to the dialogue, was too dirty it's awful. And using the CGI annoyed me very much. Why not making a ""completely honest"" old fashioned action movie for a change!<br/><br/>Stars + men on a mission + good fights + one-liners + explosions = a winning formula, despite how average it's done this round. The movie resembles its music at the climactic sequence; while looking grand it's - in fact - nothing but hot extended crescendo, with no real melody. Enthusiastic but not moving, huge but not meaty, and amusing but not greatly amusing. So on the scale of fun, (Stallone), the movie-maker, did a good job anyway. I believe with another script, and less botox, it should have been very good though.<br/><br/>(The Expendables) is a B movie celebration a la old fashion. It dreamed of (The Seven Samurai), but in terms of stiff faces and cartoonish characters, it got so close to (The Muppet Show), to become eventually a cross between both, without much of their perfection."

That's how manly THE EXPENDABLES is...<br/><br/>As a boy's action-adventure movie, THE EXPENDABLES delivers, with hand-to-hand, gun-to-gun, wall-to-wall, ball-to-ball man-sweat; hot women (Giselle Itié, Charisma Carpenter) and a cool seaplane; hella fun, with hard action, hard livin' and forearms as hard as roped steel cables.<br/><br/>Seems Stallone has given up trying to impress audiences with his considerable acting talent and opted, in his autumn, to revert back to the gunmetal thunder of his macho youth that involved beating up people and baritone mumbles. (Autumn? At 64, still built like a freight train. Now that's the power of will, the power of diet, the power of, uh, steroids.) Stallone heads a mercenary team informally known as The Expendables, which includes Jason Statham (most agile), Jet Li (most diminutive), Terry Crews (most trapezius), Randy Couture (most xtreme) and Dolph Lundgren (most junkie giant). Eric Roberts (most B-Movie) is the villain, with Steve Austin (most neck) as his muscle. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis cameo in a man-banter scene with Stallone that makes its own semen sandwich. Mickey Rourke (most tattooed) is an ex-member of the boy band, who surprisingly turns out to be the heart of the movie.<br/><br/>It is Mickey's tragic baritone mumbling about how he could have saved one woman's life, after taking so many lives in a war zone, that spurs Stallone into going non-merc and rescuing one of the hot women for free (apparently to redeem his soul, but mostly cos she looked like a Euro runway model), and our hearts go out to him and his boys for having to kill all those faceless junta drogues who can't hit the side of a barn with their machine guns and army training.<br/><br/>A wet-dream tough guy ensemble, Stallone directs and co-writes and beats up people and baritone mumbles."

","Story: Bernie Ross, a chief of a band of skilled mercenaries is asked to do a hard job. He and his man are supposed to overthrow a ruthless general, who is a leader of a small Central American island. General is supported by renegade CIA operative who sees the island as a great opportunity to get wealth and power. He feels strong, but he did not yet meet Ross and his band.<br/><br/>Acting: Well acting in these films is mostly adequate. Some of the cast are not even actors but sportsmen and it is easy to spot, because they are the worst. Stallone himself was never a very good actor but he is adequate in his role. For Lundgren and Statham I can say the same. Only standouts are villains Roberts and Zayas who are much better than the rest, but still only good. Only very good actor here is Rourke whos easily the best actor in the film, he is the real standout. But I have to admit acting is not important in film like this so I do not hold it against it very much.<br/><br/>Direction and camera: Film is fast, full of jokes and Easter eggs and is really over the top. Acting scenes are very good.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This film stayed true to what I expected, this really is a good homage to commando. It is a very good old school action film and must be watched as such."
"Jonathon_Natsis","5","0","4","1 February 2011"," A tough movie about tough men who beat up other tough mentoughly.
","In what could quite possibly be the manliest movie of all time, Sylvester Stallone is the lead actor, writer and director of The Expendables, the visually explosive extravaganza that, even with minimal advertising, generated a heap of publicity over the Internet because of its extreme action and dream cast. Does it live up to the hype? It does, in all the areas you'd expect, but not in those that would elevate this film to 'memorable' status.<br/><br/>Stallone plays Barney Ross, the head of a team of mercenaries who make a crust by taking on assassination missions given to them by people who, well, want someone dead. At his side are: right-hand man Lee Christmas (Statham), Ying Yang (Li) and Toll Road (Couture), with smaller roles played by Lundgren, Rourke and Crews, among others. This time, they're sent to South America to overthrow a corrupt dictator and a myriad of other generic baddies.<br/><br/>Far and away, the worst aspect of this film is the ridiculous, inarticulate screenplay put together by Stallone and Callaham. In what appears to be an effort to churn out quick draw one-liners at a rate of about eighty a minute, virtually anything that comes out of any character's mouth will leave you squirming in your seat, and constantly wondering why it took the efforts of two men to write this poor excuse for a script.<br/><br/>As one of my many film-osophies, I have mentioned in the past that a cohesive and clever screenplay is the most crucial factor in determining critical success for any film. In this case, the writers couldn't be lazier in constructing what some may refer to as 'witty banter' between a group of (supposedly) long-time friends. In a disappointing overall script, two scenes stand out among the rest: Rourke's unravelling of a dark moment in his past (which isn't touched on again for the remainder of the film), and a conversation between Stallone and (cameo appearances from) two other bonafide action megastars, which does generate a couple of laughs and even more pop culture references.<br/><br/>From one extreme to another, The Expendables is at its most enjoyable, unsurprisingly, during the all-out set pieces. For all his weaknesses as a writer, Stallone does not receive due credit for being able to direct action, and direct it well. Crisp choreography is constantly on display, but never more so than during the fight between Couture and Austin, who have both competed in some form of martial arts previously, and clearly have the art down pat.<br/><br/>Just as important is the refreshing camera use during these highly charged scenes. Too often blockbuster directors have assumed that the way to direct action is with a closely focused camera and a mind-bending number of quick cuts (see: Clash of the Titans and the Transformers saga). Believe it or not, the audience actually likes seeing what is going on during these scenes, and Stallone doesn't disappoint in this area, ensuring a wide enough shot that allows viewers to comprehend the intense on-screen pace, while still capturing the testosterone emulating from the actors. Take notes, Michael Bay.<br/><br/>I couldn't end a review of The Expendables without mentioning the input of Terry 'Double Sun Power' Crews. A perennial crowd favourite, his ballistic assault on the enemy with his weapon of choice during the climax will leave you fighting the urge to cheer in your seat; 'crowd- pleaser' is the best, and only, way to describe it. So, after all that, has The Expendables done enough to call itself the manliest film ever made? Unfortunately, I feel that honour still rests with Casino, but this film has certainly done enough to provoke you to knock out the next person who badmouths facial hair, followed by a round of fist-bumping and man-hugs to celebrate."

The fight scenes were well executed but be prepared on some bloody ones. <br/><br/>I am very surprised how fit and muscled Sly still is.

","There are very few movies out there that will amp you up like ""The Expendables."" Maybe not so much for the ladies, but Sylvester Stallone's battle royal of action stars and other renowned muscle men from the last three decades will convince almost every man that lifting weights, eating a steak and potatoes dinner and cruising about looking to kick some ass is a great idea for the immediate future.<br/><br/>But what ""The Expendables"" possesses in pure testosterone it lacks in just about everything else. The plot and subplots are entirely, well, expendable.<br/><br/>Including cameos from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, the cast Stallone assembles is simply grunt-tastic, maybe minus the absence of a Jean Claude Van Damme. Combining Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren among others makes the film impressive enough. If you think all those names plus others smells of gimmick and nothing else, you're wrong. Seeing these guys together is most if not all the magic of the film.<br/><br/>Stallone leads this team of war vets and other skilled fighters turned assassins for hire who possess deadly gun and knife accuracy as well as fist-fighting skills. They take a job in Venezuela to depose a dictator who's the puppet of an ex-CIA man. There are a few other details, but again, pointless as far as what this movie aims to do. Successfully, however, this does allow for the explosions to commence.<br/><br/>Every gun shot, every fiery blast, every punch and every knife jammed through some dude's throat (and that happens several more times than you'd think) gets amplified both visually and through sound effects. The action never loses excitement or intensity and that alone keeps ""The Expendables"" from journeying into simply bad movie territory. Stallone clearly understands that all can be forgiven (or we can at least be distracted long enough) when things go boom in creative ways. Stallone and Statham's sea plane escape and subsequent revenge on the Venezuelans on the dock makes for one of the most enjoyable action sequences of the year.<br/><br/>It's amazing as an action-lover how quickly you can forget pointless cameos, unfunny attempts at levity and cliché action movie plot devices. One might find it easier to chastise Stallone for making a film that must pummel its audience into submission with gunfire and explosions, but I say success where most others fail; half the films of this ilk use the same technique and don't manage to keep critics from seeing through the fiery guise. ""The Expendables,"" for the most part, does wow its audience enough to find enjoyment where there otherwise would be repetitiveness.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"Scarecrow-88","6","0","4","27 December 2010"," The Expendables
","Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham(who, truth be told, is the real star of the movie), Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren(the best role he's had in over a decade or so), Randy Couture, and Terry Crews are commandos/mercenaries paid to do the dirty work that goes unreported in the news or media. We see in the opening that they wipe out a bunch of Somalian pirates who were demanding ransom for kidnapped refugees. Eric Roberts slides comfortably into his drug-lord-in-a-fine-tailored-suit role(with a viper grin) with Stone Cold Steve Austin his heavy duty muscle(let's be honest he kicks Stallone's ass in their hand-to-hand combat sequence). David Zayas is the military leader of a ""country in the Gulf"" named Vilena who has joined forces(it's a bumpy partnership, however)with Roberts in operating a drug trade using their army to terrorize the locals so that they submit to working in the cocaine fields. Mickey Rourke(who is part of the film just because he's cool)is a former member of Stallone's Expendables group. A subplot has Stallone having to excommunicate Lundgren because he's a junkie who has lost his edge, almost lynching one of the Somalian pirates. Stallone will be enlisted by CIA man Bruce Willis(Arnold Schwartzenegger turns down the job; himself a leader, it seems, of some sort of mercenary group..perhaps a homage to ""Predator"", maybe?)to assassinate dictator Zayas(the true target is ex-CIA Roberts)and cripple his army rule. I have two words for this movie:Missed Opportunities. Because Stallone insists on shooting action scenes mostly darkly lit in a jerky camera method, we miss out on what could've been an epic battle between Lundgren and Li. And Austin's fight with Stallone is murky as well because it's shot in a darkened tunnel..what's frustrating here is that Stallone endured severe punishment with Austin while filming the scene. Even more aggravating is the fact that most of the violence with guns and knives are shot in the black of night and shadow or off screen completely--an absolute no-no for blood thirsty action fans who expected RAMBO with a collection of muscleheads. One thing Stallone delivers in spades are plenty of explosions and pyrotechnics at the end. There's also a bad ass sequence where Stallone is flying their fighter plane as Statham fires from the hole of the nose of said plane(later Stallone drops gasoline which Statham ignites a river ramp with plenty of Zayas and Roberts' army sent up in flames). There is a pretty decent car chase as Lundgren(who has betrayed his men in a moment of weakness, paid by Roberts to alleviate his serious threat)attempts to crash Stallone with Li in the back of the truck with a machine gun trying to thwart his efforts. The ""blow sh%t up"" mantra is one I often embrace, but in this movie that's all Stallone is successful at. Machine guns fire as does Crews' big ass missile launcher which explodes giant huts with ease sending men hurling in the air. I guess that might be a reason to recommend the movie, what I just mentioned. But you don't get the best out of Li by a long shot, not to mention, Crews or Couture have very little to do until the end. A good portion of the film has Stallone hanging out with Rourke in his bar or Sly and Statham scouting out Vilena. Statham, though, does get to show his stuff on more than one occasion such as when he and Sly must eliminate several soldiers in order to save Zayas' daughter, Giselle Itié, or beating the crap out of the abusive boyfriend(and his basketball buddies)of his former girlfriend, Charisma Carpenter(underused). And Statham's work with Rourke is fun, particularly their knife-to-dart-board duels. Rourke even has one of those emotional scenes where he comments on losing his humanity when he didn't save a suicide victim who leaped from a bridge, mentioning how the ""blood and guts"" mercenary business had taken something from him. Maybe a sequel will be in the works which could rectify the mistakes made in this movie..I don't see why not since this flick brought in a bucket load. A fight between Austin and Couture could've been a major highlight(especially since one of them goes up in flames)if you could see the damn thing. Sigh."
"swo0","5","0","3","26 December 2010"," Not as awesome as it should have been
","I saw this movie expecting a mindless action movie with lots of shooting, explosions and the like; along the lines of 'True Lies', you know the kind. It only delivered a marginal amount of that.<br/><br/>There were indeed a some really nice fightmoves, a bunch of explosions and the like. However, a large part of the movie was spent on explaining the somewhat bad and overly complicated story (Something along the lines of 'those are bad guys, kill them' would have sufficed) and inferior dialogue. You don't go to a movie with Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham and Jet Li just to see them talk half the time.<br/><br/>About half of the not nearly enough explosions were clearly fake. They don't have to equal movies like Avatar on cgi level, these however were special effects like those seen in, say, GoldenEye from 15 years ago.<br/><br/>If you've seen all the good action movies already this one is worth the 2 hours. I would advise everyone else just to click on one of the main actors in this movie and watch another one they played in, 50/50 chance you've got one better than this."
"aaronb955","6","0","4","4 December 2010"," Stallone the director took the day off on this one
","I expected a little more from this movie considering that Stallone's last 2 movies were great. Rocky Balboa and Rambo had lots of action but also had heart. I guess because they were such iconic characters that he is identified with and he made those movies with passion. This movie had lots and lots of action and I loved it. But nothing else. Sure all the meatheads from the 80s were there but it was really Stallone and Statham in most of the scenes. I just wish there was little more meat in the story. Every scene was an action movie cliché.. good guys never miss and the bad guys can't shoot straight even though our hero only has a knife. The women are just props. The scene with Bruce Willis and Arnold was just a waste and probably the worst scene in the movie put together simply as a gimmick to get the big 3 in the same scene. Stallone could have explored the CIA drug smuggling connection a little more seriously. Also Jet Li hardly had anything to do. They could have dropped Terry Crews or Randy Couture and given Jet Li the big gun. Think about it, Terry Crews is the crazy guy from the Old spice commercial not a big action star and is nowhere close to the stature of Jet Li or the other stars. Jet Li did have some funny lines though. Having said all that , the action was fantastic. My favorite was Jason Statham on the nose of the airplane firing those guns to destroy the pier and also the fight scene in the tunnel under the palace. If there's anything I would like in the sequel is a stronger storyline and same amount of action."

","I'm Quite a fan of Sylvester Stallone and i really wanted to enjoy this movie, but it has to be said, the script is pretty awful. Some parts of the dialogue are clearly not well thought out, and it appears the use of so many big names overshadows the questionability of the script. I must admit, some of the action is not bad, at times particularly graphic of a 'Rambo-esk' style, however at some points it feels as if i'm just watching another cheesy god awful Jason Statham film, the likes of Transporter. I was disappointed that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis were only in one short scene, understandably for Schwarzenegger, but i would have like to have seen Bruce Willis with a bigger role in the film. Overall i think i expected more from this film with the array of big 'Action hero' names at its disposal, it was a pretty average film with some awesome action at times, but a dire plot is what ultimately disappoints for me."

","Sly Stallone and his merry band of mercenaries (including Jet Li and Jason Statham) take on an assignment involving an island run by a dictatorial general and a CIA renegade (Eric Roberts). For various reasons, Stallone decides not to pursue the assignment after visiting the island, but circumstances (like his attempted assassination) find him and his hale fellows returning to the island to turn an army of bad guys into yesterday's guacamole. We are able to buy a visibly aged Stallone in the lead the same way we went along with old John Wayne and old Clint Eastwood. Statham actually seems to have the lion's share of screen time, and that's fine as the man is definitely in his prime. Li gets to show his stuff as well, and serves as the movie's comic relief. Dolph Lundgren and the others are essentially doing cameos, and that's just fine with me as too many cooks most assuredly can spoil the broth. The plot is a bit creaky and drags between the action scenes, but those action scenes are marvelous and right out of the golden age of action flicks, namely the 1980s. The only thing bothering me was watching Stallone on various talk shows promoting the film and claiming he had a very modest budget to work with. The actual budget: $80,000,000. That ain't exactly chicken soup."
"shorvath55","6","0","4","27 November 2010"," Lots and lots of action, nothing cerebral. It's absurd.
","I rented the movie as I had heard it was action packed. This is absolutely true and nobody could dispute this fact. As far as the story's plot, I believe that Stallone tailored it in his creative mind to support the action set-up and its sequences. I found 2 conflicting ideas in the film: Number 1 is why did Dolph Lundgren's character turned traitor, and Number 2 is why didn't the rescued woman leave with Stallone after he came back for her? I guess he did not want to leave the impression of a Love story of any kind with such a crew of bad ass mercenaries who'd rival the French Foreign Legion who are comparable to U.S. Marine's Elite fighters. In closing, I think it is absurd and laugh out loud ridiculous to believe that 8 men survived an onslaught of hundreds of enemy soldiers, dodged thousands of rounds of ammunition, blew up an entire fortress, and yet all 8 walked away unscathed without a single wound! I think this is absurd! Hey, welcome to Hollywood where everything is possible on the silver screen. In closing, this movie had used the most pyrotechnics in movie history."

"Samiam3","6","0","3","19 November 2010"," Just not bad...(lots of muscle, very little brains)
","The Expendables is spectacular action alongside amateurish film making. I had a professor ask once rhetorically; why if these movies can afford to invest money/time in CGI, pyrotechnics, and spectacular stunts can they not afford invest time into screen writing. What hurts the Expendables most is non-existent characterization which leads to wooden acting across the board and a plot that makes no sense.<br/><br/>You are probably gonna leave the theatre not remembering a single character's name. Truth be told, it doesn't matter. Stalone, Stathum, Rourke, and everyone else are essentially playing themselves. The Expendables is a high school reunion of 1980's and early 90's Hollywood heroes. One of the film's more potent traits is that it is very macho. One could say that The Expendables celebrates the human body, by exposing its full potential. Indeed given the choreography, and camera work, Ludgern might be able to take on the Hulk. <br/><br/>So as a summer blockbuster, what would make the Expendables any more memorable than anything else with guns and smoke. Well sure it has a dozen action stars instead of one, but what deserves some credit is the effective staging of all the fight scenes. This motion picture requires some heavy choreography to sync up a combination of gun fire at sixty different ranges, flying knives, Juno, and Kung fu. It also helps a little recognizing that The Expendables is not willing to go sissy and submit to the ratings board. A lot of blood gets spilled in the Expendables. Sometimes it happens preposterous ways, which should probably have been exploited for humour. I liked the way Stallone can take of a guy's head which a six inch blade.<br/><br/>To bring a dozen action heroes together is one thing, but making them shine is another. Stallone's screenplay doesn't give anyone any room to grow. Mickey Rourke gets to deliver a fairly extensive speech and Stathum gets the honour of having the movies' only sub plot (dealing with his former lover) but nobody else has any thing to work with. Indeed the Expendables, despite packing a punch remains a pretty shallow experience. The best I can say about it is that it is fun in the moment, but silly and not super memorable."
"RResende","Null","0","3","12 October 2010"," tough guys
","Generally speaking, this was what was expected of it. It is a film about tough guys, properly old and old fashioned, according to today's standards. It follows every cliché of the older films, and even the action scenes of each actor mirror what we remember seeing them do. We can even see which character was supposed to be performed by Van Damme!, based on his action sequences (the flying kick, out of the fire). We have the love-driven motivations that were quite common in every breed of the 80's action, from Chuck Norris to Sly. But that was what everybody was expecting, right? Those who went to see this one wanted to see the fake toughness of this now old guys. It was a time travel, we were not watching the old guys, instead we were watching the memory of them, a cartoon of them. And having this kind of ""old glories"" casting was like seeing Batman, Spiderman and Superman in the same story.<br/><br/>But apart from that, there were interesting things going on here. One of them, the less remarkable, was the adaptation of old fashioned action styles (big muscles, physical poses, hard punches) to a modern eye to catch action, in which we are taken to the middle of the fight. In a way it was a kind of Statham vs Stallone thing. This was well done, i guess, but it's quite impossible to stitch the two together. It's like placing Chaplin on a Monthy Pyton film. But it's interesting how Stallone, the director, is in touch with what's being done.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is the only true actor here. Everybody does what's expected, and risks nothing outside what everybody expects them to be. But Rourke has a true life hanging on his bones, and his bits are the best of the film, the ones where we feel we are watching a film, and not a collection of punch clips. That's why he was here, to through acting dimension to the film. That's also why they didn't put his character on the fights, nor made him killed by some stupid revenge. I enjoyed that they did this.<br/><br/>Stallone+Willis+Arnold. It works, because it is what we know it is: the folding of the real world of the politician Schwarzenegger, who invades the space of the former actor Schwarzenegger, clicks something in the audiences that causes irresistible and stupid laughs (i laughed). The film can take, as a short isolated clip.<br/><br/>If this could have had Van Damme, Seagal, Snipes... and someone else i'm forgetting, it would probably have been a better cartoon, but a worse film. As it is, it's well leveraged.<br/><br/>My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

What is more, I was fascinated by the acting, because often action flicks tend to be ridiculous in terms of acting. But not for this one, Stallone and the other dudes deserve an Oscar, I really mean it honestly. Also, the film features some memorable scenes such as the scene of the plane when Stallone got angry and Stathem was shooting the bad guys up with that hidden machine gun in the plane.

Not particularly in a very good way but it's satisfying.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that it doesn't use it's good cast fully. While the hype surrounds the fact that Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are in this film, they only stay in the film for about two minutes. The film centers around Stallone and Statham's characters and the rest we do not get to know well. The rest of the cast has great potential but they are only supplementary . Everyone gets their own spotlight at certain points and it's quite cool to see what each character is capable of however again I was waiting for this movie to really entertain me. Overall it feels like there's something missing.<br/><br/>The movie isn't boring but it's not particularly amazing like everyone would expect it to be. You would definitely expect more from a cast like this. There are better action films, although I'd think this one had the craziest last twenty minute action. There are some good scenes that make you stay at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The gore is quite good but it's so over the top that it doesn't make you cringe. That's a thumbs up for those who can't stand gore. It's still awesome though. It's not as violent as the last Rambo movie but it's quite up there. Nothing that's too disturbing though. The music does the job and the sound effects are great. The sound is over the top along with the gore. The blood spurt sound effects and each punch adds a great feeling for the ear.<br/><br/>The movie tries to give the characters a back story, therefore giving them something to work with. However the movie itself isn't very significant, and the plot is not interesting. It is an action film but the plot should be interesting enough for me to care. I can see that Stallone tried to give his and Statham's characters some drama but it still is not enough for me to give focus.<br/><br/>After all the problems that is mentioned, this movie might sound bad. But it's not. It's an okay movie to enjoy. Nothing ""wow""-ing though.<br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>★★★☆☆ Satisfying"

Kurt Russel, JCvD, Wesley Snipes, the Mayor are just the first that spring to mind. <br/><br/>The downside: <br/><br/>Most of the potential was wasted.<br/><br/>Yes, it's about action, not much else - but there is still room for rough sketches of motivations, situations, what is where and why, some basic plot that gives tension to the whole.

But to realize the potential, it needs some quality directing and script, which *this* instance did not have.<br/><br/>Even a ""mindless action flick"" can be well directed. Doesn't John Woo live in the USA now?"
"elliotfabregas","6","0","3","23 September 2010"," The Expendables, a good laugh but forget about it
","The expendables was a film which did not receive as much hype and interest as I thought it would. It is in effect a strange film in many ways and most of it relies on who you interpret the film. Is it a bunch of macho losers trying to make a point? Or is it a kind of a personal vendetta for each of these ""legendary"" actors to make a point.<br/><br/>The movie in itself is quite enjoyable. Intense, practically non-stop action and witty, if not slightly cheesy one liners and of course the pleasure of seeing all the '80s and '90s action hero's all in one film. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger star in the film's funniest cameo.<br/><br/>However, the film has many useless elements to it. The inclusion of Randy Couture and Terry Crews is trivial and unnecessary. Also a basic plot, no twists and failed attempt at love between Sylvester Stallone and rebel girl Sandra when the charming Jason Statham would have been much more suited. The sub-plot of Jason Statham's girlfriend having another man is out of place and quite predictable. Last is Jason Statham's pathetic attempt at poetry in the final moments of the film.<br/><br/>The Expendables was over all quite an enjoyable movie. We have the joy of seeing the stars of, Die Hard, True Lies, Rambo and more but the film lacks intelligent (not surprising if you put the IQ of the stars together) and style. It promises much but there are too many weak parts to make this film a true, great."

","'The Expendables' looked like it was going to be the film of a lifetime for me. All the greats in one film. What was better? And while it didn't blow me out of the water it still thrilled me. I think when a film's hyped up to much it exceeds your expectations like this one did. That's not to see I didn't enjoy it. I loved it, just thought it could have been better. Jet Li's my idol, so to see him lose against Dolph Lundgren was a let down, especially as he could probably serve every one of the cast members single handed. Everyone in it did what they were paid to do. Kick ass. These aren't really actors they're action stars so acting's not they're speciality. It was nice to see Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger in cameo roles, though performing a little action wouldn't have hurt. The fight scenes are well choreographed and I was pleasantly surprised to read that veteran martial arts choreographer Corey Yuen was behind some action. 'The Expendables' won't change cinema but it was certainly exciting stuff and a must for any serious action fan."
"fitjerald","5","0","4","15 September 2010"," Watch it...Enjoy it....Then Forget it!!
","Was waiting eagerly for this film. I mean...what better star cast can you get for an action flick? There is Stallone, there is Statham, there is Jet Li, there is Rourke, there are cameos from Arnie and Bruce! That only makes you like the movie a lot...perhaps! But unfortunately...the movie doesn't stand up to the expectation level...at least for people like me, who expected it to be an action flick to remember!<br/><br/>There is absolutely no storyline. But I feel what hurts the movie the most, is the fact that there is no character-building in this movie. A bit of background-showing would have helped the viewers to relate themselves to the characters more perhaps. I am a huge Jet Li fan, but he & his superb skills are just wasted in this movie. These people are called 'the Expendables'...but if you go by the movie, they should rather be called 'The Invincibles' or even 'The Immortals'. The villains never looked scary or even cruel. No wonder..there was no suspense at all!<br/><br/>But if you like action, there is a lot! From the very first minute to the very last. The movie is quite fast-paced. I won't give it a Thumb- down. It's worth a one-time viewing for action-movie-lovers. But don't watch it with any high expectation. Forget about 'Rambo' or 'Rocky' series...just think of a Popcorn-movie for time pass and you won't dislike it much."
"siderite","6","0","3","13 September 2010"," It was fun, but utterly unsatisfying...
","Oh, I have waited for this movie for such a long time. I knew it was directed by Sly Stallone and that the plot could and would not be any complex or good. I was even expecting some bad acting and some personal disappointment. And still, the movie managed to let me down.<br/><br/>Yes, the cast is made of action icons of my childhood and youth (and that ought to say something), but the roles are made for only two people: Stallone and Jason Statham. The other guys just happen to be there, say a few lines, do nothing spectacular while the bad guys explode in uninteresting and boring explosions after saying unmemorable lines.<br/><br/>Sorry, Mr. Stallone, this movie failed. It was a box office bomb, that's for sure, but the quality... you could and should have done better!<br/><br/>Bottom line: it would have been enjoyable in the 80's when I was 8 years old, but not now. Even worse, the characters could have been played by any actor, good or bad, known or unknown, the roles were so simple and plain. So, in the end, I just feel cheated that I watched a bad clichéd action movie for one single reason: the cast."
"The-Last-Prydonian","5","0","3","10 September 2010"," The sort of fare that would have gone direct to DVD had Stallone not been behind it
","It has to be said that you either have to admire Sylvester Stallone or laugh at him. Either way he's a like his most famous iconic creation, Rocky Balboa he's never been one to go down without a fight. However in more recent years, age and diminishing box office clout has forced him to retread old ground by revisiting familiar territory with both ""Rocky Balboa"" and ""Rambo"". Once again he more or less does the same thing with ""The Expendables"" a tribute if you like to the loud, slam bang, action films of the eighties with which he made his name with. Gathering around him a mixed bag of old pro's some of which made their name (which is now somewhat dubious given where their careers have ended up)back in the day. ""The Expendables"" could be seen as an old man's affectionate if some what shallow, back slapping look back on past glories. And while satisfying enough in a superficial sense it won't win any wards for innovation. For to be honest the movie had it not had Stallones stamp upon wouldn't have seemed out of place in a direct to DVD bargain bin. A place where a certain Dolph Lundgren has found himself relegated to. Fortunately Stallone to his merit Isn't without some writing or notable directorial attributes which is what manages to raise it slightly above the hackneyed tripe that Lundgren is now to forced peddle. <br/><br/>An elite team of mercenaries, The Expendables of the movies title are hired by government bigwig, the enigmatically titled Mr. Church to bring down a corrupt South American dictator. A man who runs a small Island country with the aid of former CIA agent gone rogue James Munroe (Eric Roberts). Barney Ross (Stallone) and his number two Lee, (British action star Jason Statham who is the baby of the bunch at 38) travel ahead to scout the territory and meet with their secret contact and local rebel Sandra. But when things go awry, Ross and Lee are forced to flee with Sandra being left behind to face the music. With the choice of walking away from the entire mess, Barney's conscience tells him to do otherwise and he assembles his crew to go back in, rescue Sandra and finish the job. Like I said, It's abouts as shallow as they come.<br/><br/>One big celebration of bygone days and of the action genre, it's hardly a surprise that Stallone has assembled a cast that includes Jet-Li, Dolph Lundgren et al. Of course you can't have a slam-bam action throw back to the eighties hey day without the obligatory cameos from a certain Bruce Willis and a dubious governor of California, the latter's being so fleeting, gratuitous and heavy handed it borders on offensive. Subtle this film Isn't but then what were we to expect. Lundgren seems to mainly inhabit a role that might as well be an extended cameo and is left with a character that conveniently sits upon a moral see saw and results in eventually being nothing more than a tool utilised to briefly kick some ass and forward the films leaden plot. The rest of the Expendables seem with the exception of Statham (who unsurprisingly is lumbered with the hackneyed minor romantic sub-plot) to be their mainly just to make up the numbers while Mickey Rourke is merely on hand to offer some ""sage"" counsel as old friend and former team mate, Tool. <br/><br/>But for all the requisite clichés that abound Stallone does seem to be having fun on and off camera and as he has proved in the past that while he has a habit for at times being a tad trite and all too crowd pleasing. His direction is never the less fluid and he manages to never let the pace of the film drag. The action sequences are fairly impressive and although neither he and Statham aren't the greatest of actors they gel well together and have a likable, aimable chemistry in their shared scenes, leading me to wonder if their was as much camaraderie off camera as there is on. It is to Stallone's merit that he even managed to film some of the movies more hands on, fight sequences. And added to this it's a film that never takes itself entirely too seriously, although it does of course lapse in to the odd moment of dramatic gravitas. But to some extent you can't help but think that with every explosion and obliging one liner you would come to expect that Stallone is wallowing in the absurd and superficiality in it all. He knows basically knows what his core audience wants and is unashamed to deliver.<br/><br/>As arguably the main villain, Eric Roberts a fine and undervalued actor once again is left with the typical sneering bad guy that he has become mainly known for playing. Although solid you can't help but think he deserves better than being forced to play two-dimensional villains. <br/><br/>As hollow as what it would be on paper, ""The Expendables"" is something of a guilty pleasure. It Isn't the most inspiring and original of projects that Stallone has helmed and yet considering most of his career, it's just another one of a number of glossy action pics that he can associate himself with. You might say It's an affectionate look at a period with which Stallone and others like him made their name. And while I'm in no doubt there is affectionate intent when It's all said and done It's just another dumb, loud action pick all be it a solid one at that."
"acerky","7","0","3","10 September 2010"," A slight disappointment, but still fun
","The Expendables is basically an action film junkie's dream drug. You get a whole team of action stars, from Stallone to Statham, from Jet Li to Lundgren, even Stone Cold Steve Austin and Eric Roberts show up as the bad guys. Cool? Well, kinda.<br/><br/>Now, I like the whole idea of all these musclemen teaming together to make an action film that is totally balls out and nowhere near as complicated as Bourne or Salt, and in that aspect, it succeeds. But Stallone needs a better editor and cinematographer.<br/><br/>Some scenes just drag on and on when they should have been shorter, and sadly some of the fight scenes were either not properly lit or was shot too close so you can't see who's kicking who or where. This spoilt the film for me.<br/><br/>Other than that, Stallone delivers yet again. Too bad he couldn't get Van Damme, Seagal or Snipes to be here. But he does manage to get Willis and the Governator himself to make cameos! Now if that's not cool, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Go see this. But again I must say, it can be better."
"zubsero","6","0","3","8 September 2010"," 15 years too late!
","A one half hour of, politically motivated, high testosterone, cheesy one-liner, clichéd, exaggerated, predictable, borderline racist, killing spree! There were three things missing from this film, Jean Claude Van Dame, Jackie Chan, and a proper story line. This film is 15 years too late.<br/><br/>The plot? There isn't one! It is a mash up of every action movie I enjoyed growing up, so it is more a nostalgia trip than a movie. With Willis and Schwarzenegger now too old to do anything they were given bit parts, but the story line would have been so much better had this happened when the three big stars of the 80's and 90's were still young - Think Predator, Die Hard and Rambo all rolled into one! I am however glad there was not a terrorist plot, as that would have been ridiculous! What was really wrong with film was the exaggeration. The hand gun ranges were worse than Modern Warfare 2 and the explosions were too big! The acting was awful, some characters last way too long and should have been killed straight away! There was an unnecessary drama that led to nothing most of the way through this film. The music did not sit well with the action; it gave no ambiance to any of the scenes and there were only three females in this entire film - make of that what you will! The saving grace for this film is Jet Li and the fight scenes. Although used for comic relief - ""not so funny!"" - his hand to hand combat with a drugged up Lundgren is a truly exceptional sequence. The choreography of the other fight scenes was good although a little embellished and too matrix for my liking.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this film to anyone? No! This is only for the people who know and like the actors in this film and would like to take a trip back in time! Imagine political conflicts could be solved with an unlimited ammo gun and times that by ""four and a half""!"
"scottshak_111","6","0","3","8 September 2010"," Awesome action but poor story
","The Expendables had a lot of action so much that they forgot to give a good motive behind all the hullabaloo. The movie retained the finest action figures one could only dream of putting together in one frame and that was exactly what Sylvester Stallone did. Watching Sylvester guiding a bunch of mercenaries was a joy in itself and that too action heroes like Jet Li, Jason Statham, Randy Couture and Terry Crews. Steve Austin maintains his dignity by beating the crap out of Sylvester Stallone but eventually ends up as a victim to Randy Couture (Austin was a bad guy in the movie so that was bound to happen..... Stop giving him such roles!).<br/><br/>Jason Statham manifested some great skills in there with his awesome fighting style. Jet Li augmented himself to the list of fighters by beating the hell out of the bad guys. Dolph Lundgren was asked to leave the group because of which he fires back at Sylvester and Jet Li but ends up getting shot ( not killed as he rejoins the team eventually ). Eric Roberts poses himself as the bad guy with Steve Austin watching his back every now and then.<br/><br/>I was highly disappointed because of the limited roles of Arnold and Bruce Willis. It was a real bummer when I found Mickey Rourke sitting and relaxing as well and not getting himself entailed in the ruckus. The villains end up in a snap and the whole story ends up abruptly albeit an intelligent script could have scored better. In my eyes however the movie scores because of its action scenes. The conversation of Arnold and Sylvester was hilarious although short but a nice one. I wish Arnold,Bruce and Mickey get to do more than a mere talk if supposedly there is a sequel on the cards. Also the action that was supposed to come from the tough guys in a scintillating manner came up pretty lame ( that of Sylvester mainly ). Although the movie had a poor story line it wasn't that bad as I found it really entertaining. I would recommend those who are big fans of these guys because watching them in action and that too together isn't something that happens daily."
"TwistedVanity","7","0","3","29 August 2010"," Great film shame about the camera work
","The film is an A to B action movie, no surprises but an excellent film. Its fun, its action packed, lots of bullets and explosions, and no weird twists at the end. The big action scenes are amazing, but let down by the camera work. The action is fast none stop and swaps evenly between all 5 of the mercenary team. Which is refreshing and one of the things that makes this amazing. (However I can't help but feel that Jet Li was under used. Being an action star normally able to carry a whole film on his own with unbeatable martial arts, I found Li and his martial arts under played here)Although this is Stallone's film, you can't help but feel that the real star was Jason Stratham, who just steals the movie in every scene he's in. With superb acting, presence and timing he just stands out and really shines here. I really enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>HOWEVER the action is really fast and instead of standing back and letting the camera take it all in (ie like the Bourne films) instead the camera man tries to follow the action which means its moving about too fast not quite in sync with the action moves and the end result is disorientating. It feels choppy, and really hard to follow and appreciate. This is a shame because the action, when you are able to follow it, has some really impressive moves. I can't help but think that had I been able to follow it, this would probably have been the best choreographed action film ever. The bits you are able to follow and appreciate certainly live up to this belief."
"stsampel-iphone","6","0","4","27 August 2010"," What I expect
","If you read the lineup and you know who directed this movie, you will know what you have to expect. The movie was quiet ""good"". The dialogs are flat and senseless, very much action and a lot of explosions. But Stallone made many mistakes by directing. So I think 80% of this movie are extreme close-ups. You never get a chance for a good overview. If u watch this movie in cinema your eyes may hurt after a while. But I smiled a lot while watching and in comparison to many other movies released this year, this will be the only one I may watch twice. Don't watch it with ur kids, because there are extreme violent scenes, like exploding heads and bodies. This might not be good for an child^^"

I cannot remember the last big budget action made similar to ""The Expendables""? Maybe the last Die-hard film? Not bad acting, but a weak script. The rouge CIA operative as a bad guy has been done way to often. Big cast, I think the big cast was the hook to draw the audience in. Arnold was in the movie for 5 minutes. I wonder if Arnold was in """"The Expendable"" as an Omen for an Arnold/Stallone Expendables 2. I noticed that Stegal, and Van Dame where not in this film? Maybe the action film actors will also be in a part 2. 6 out of 10. The Expendables is a rental or video on demand movie. I would watch it with beer and pizza on a Friday night."

Obviously don't expect a great plot or great performances, but be ready for some very intense hardcore action! In my opinion, this was one of the best action movies of the past few years, in which Stallone and his friends delivered 103 minutes of absolute fun!

The direction is all about the payoff and less about the tension. Every character's development was done in a previous movie (every actor here, is essentially playing their most famous character to date, just now they have a different name) and the music is exactly what you expect.<br/><br/>The Expendables is thin on plot, directional fortitude and character development, but it's actually really fun.
