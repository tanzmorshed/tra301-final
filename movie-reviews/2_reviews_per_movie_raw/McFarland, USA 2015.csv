"BobbyT24","7","50","50","4 August 2015"," Inspiring look at coaching in a low-income area
","Okay, Kevin Costner can do this character in his sleep. His ""Coach/Manager/Player who has seen it all"" character is standard stuff for him. It's basically ""Bull Durham"", ""Draft Day"", ""For Love of the Game"" all rolled into the same guy. That's not a bad thing. I like him in those roles. It's just nothing new. What's surprising is the plethora of fabulous performances by the kids and townspeople in this terrific little TRUE story. They ROCK this picture. Special recognition to the set designers who created a beautiful location for all the running sequences. It was a rich assortment of landscapes that mesmerized the visual senses on BluRay.<br/><br/>Basic plot: Costner (Jim White) is a football coach at a reasonably successful high school program. Because of a mistake in the opening sequence, the coach is fired and lands in a dead-end town in Nowhere'sville, USA - aka McFarland, CA. The fish-out-of-water family has a few brushes with the local Mexican population where they think being the only (seemingly) white family in the area is a bad idea and are intending on moving immediately. Then Costner sees a kid running a sub-5-minute mile on his way to work in the produce fields with the rest of the population of minority workers in the area. What follows is fairly standard Disney stuff of our innocent but willing racially-inferior minnows who fight to get better against the racist, elitist killer whales (rich kids) of the other schools. What makes this watchable is how true the story is. Don't get me wrong. There are some formulaic sequences here. But how they pull it off is worth the cinematic journey. For Disney, I'm proud of them for taking a racial theme and turning it into a positive story for all involved.<br/><br/>I have to say the reason I'm giving this a ""7"" is because of the EXCELLENT behind-the-scenes stories where the filmmakers interview the runners from the team, along with the real coach, Jim White, and Kevin Costner all at the same sitting. Hearing them reminiscing (the movie is set in 1989), talking about the movie, and showing genuine care and respect for their beloved coach and each other... It's what a coach could only hope for in the children who grow up to be fine adults. Mr. White created a dynasty of runners that forged an ironclad identity with hope for the future in this nothing town when nobody was giving them a chance. One man can still make a difference on a global scale if you work hard enough. It's inspiring stuff.<br/><br/>The highest praise I can give this movie: My two teenage athlete children (soccer and baseball/softball) who have watched literally hundreds and hundreds of movies were against it. It was Disney for crying out loud. And a movie about CROSS COUNTRY no less. They would rather watch ""Mission Impossible 15"" or anything else. These are seasoned moviephiles. But Dad just wouldn't be denied. ;-) Within the first 15 minutes, they were hooked and enjoyed every minute of the rest of the movie. They even sat through the behind-the-scenes interviews. It was a family experience I won't forget. Well done, Disney.<br/><br/>As a coach myself, this is the kind of stuff that inspires me to work with kids who don't have a future in their current situation. And if you're already a coach, it may open your eyes to kids who have natural talents that may be wasted on something other than where their true skills lie. Much recommended. :-)"

","McFarland USA is much more than the regular feel good sports movie. The setting, acting, music, and story line blend perfectly to deliver a heart-warming tale. It is a film that touches all sides of this true story to make it stand out against the rest. By the time it's all done, you will feel like part of the McFarland family. <br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays Jim White, a coach whose anger forces him move to a struggling, McFarland, California, where he begins a job teaching science and gym. In this predominately Latino town Jim and his family experience a culture they hadn't been exposed to in Boise, Idaho. Very early on something about these kids catches Jim's eye, their ability to run. With a little bit of work and convincing of some students and the school administration, Jim creates a cross-country team that he believes, can achieve greatness. <br/><br/>The setting for this movie perfectly captures the feel for McFarland. Featuring plenty of dead grass, roaming dogs, endless fields, and low riders with ridiculous paint jobs, the viewer gets a feel for the town at the very beginning of the movie. Most of the people in this town are migrant workers. The run down buildings, chipping paint, and collapsing school display the poverty level of the town quite clearly. With a prison located across the street from the school, it is made clear that most kids have the choice of going to jail, or working in the fields. While the town is rather plain, the director did a great job of capturing the beautiful mountains and landscapes of the surrounding area. In addition to the beautiful scenery, the music chosen makes it feel like there is a mariachi band right in your room. The setting as a whole was delivered in a way that makes the viewer understand the economic state of the town and the surrounding area, which is a big help in supporting the plot.<br/><br/>Every singe one of the actors in this movie played the role perfectly. I was stunned by the amount of character development in such a short period of time. By the end of the movie, you will feel connected to every character. Kevin Costner seems to be simply playing himself, but Carlos Pratts steals the show with his amazing portrayal of Thomas Valles. During a training session, Thomas has an emotional break down due to the combination of a stressful life at home and the endless cycle of poverty that the people of McFarland can't seem to break. It is here that the crying, shouting, angry voice of Thomas spills all the struggles of the migrant workers and the lives they live. The characters and the writing also allow for some comic relief. A man who's last name is White struggles to pronounce Hispanic names, and the stock character of a chubby Danny Diaz who is trying his best to keep up with the rest of the team.<br/><br/>I'm impressed that the movie didn't contain a crazy amount of over dramatizations, because we all know that is the worst thing in the world. Considering it's a Disney sports movie based on a true story, you should know how it ends before you even watch it. I highly recommend you watch it anyways. It contains scenes that leave your hands sweating and your heart beating, and creates feelings similar to the first time you ever saw the Italian Stallion beat Apollo Creed in the ring. When it's all said and done, the town of McFarland, and especially its cross-country team, will hold a special place in your heart. Before you watch this movie, make sure your mom signs the permission slip, because you're about to go on a feel trip."
"LAtoSEA","10","19","20","28 January 2016"," Beautiful, organic, touching film
","After a million years as an IMDb member I'm finally inspired to write a review. This movie is guileless and sweet in the most beautiful way. Not heavy-handed, no huge buildup over the races (in all aspects of the word), but rather huge focus on interpersonal relationships and the judgments every human makes about one another. There's also huge pride in the small working towns I've personally driven through on my way to somewhere else, and the seemingly small people whose backs we live off of. There is so much heart here. I'm surprised this is a Disney movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, I believe love drives us. And this is such an affirmation of the different types of love and relationships that can push us in the best ways and help us achieve greatness. I'm so deeply pleased to have seen this film. Every one of us has a moment or period when we are down for the count. We don't always handle it with grace. That doesn't mean we are without grace."

","McFarland, USA (2014) is an amazing movie based on a true story that took place within McFarland. This film reminded me of films like ""Radio"", and others within this type of genre. The film starts off like all within in film style as it calmly introduces the cast and the story line, which paced nicely. The cast that was selected for McFarland, USA couldn't have been any better, it was perfect. For a drama film in which typically is not my favorite genre, this one kept me awaiting for more.<br/><br/>This film brings forth a story about family, hope, strength, and it holds it all together well within it's presentation, very enjoyable to say the least. McFarland, USA is a film in which I'd love to have in my personal DVD Collection as well as this is a film I'd watch many times over, this is a properly put together film. Loved it!"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>It's hard imagine anyone who would not cheer a bit after watching ""McFarland, USA"" (2015). This is a true story, and the movie is truly good and sometimes moving. It's inspirational story like you have seen many times actually, but it is made so well that at running time 2 h 5 min this movie never drags and is involving from start till finish.<br/><br/>Overall, ""McFarland, USA"" is sometimes routine and familiar, yet very entertaining movie. Kevin Costner is good in here, and although no Oscars will shine with this movie, it's nevertheless a very well made picture. Directing was solid - pacing of this movie is great. Music was nice, as well as cinematography. It's not very original picture, but a very fine one."
"Afshin-A","8","17","19","5 December 2015"," Simple, predictable, but very appealing
","In making this movie Kevin Costner stuck to the formula, the one that most feel good sports movies use, and made it work beautifully. There are no unexpected fancy twists in this one. The acting is straight up and solid. The ethnic background of the movie adds to the movie in good way. I enjoy a few of the scenes that involve the interactions between the coach or his family and the locals. They demonstrate how cultural interaction and familiarity can eliminate fear and breakdown the walls that divide us. Don't get me wrong, the movie is not trying to give you a social/cultural lecture, this stuff comes naturally mixed with the main story line.<br/><br/>If you like the genre, you'll enjoy this movie."

","Track coach Jim White is a newcomer to a predominantly Latino high-school in California's Central Valley. <br/><br/>Coach White and his new students find that they have much to learn about one another, but things begin to change when White realises the boys' exceptional running ability. <br/><br/>More than just physical prowess drives the teens to succeed. Their strong family ties, incredible work ethic and commitment to their team all play a factor in forging these novice runners into champions.......<br/><br/>Sports movies featuring Kevin Costner are the cinematic equivalent of Cheese on Toast. You've had it before, numerous times, and you know what exactly what you are going to get. But too much of the stuff isn't too good for you.<br/><br/>I'm a big Kevin Costner champion, he's always been a big screen presence, and even though he's had his shortcomings (The Postman was almost career suicide, but WaterWorld was not, I repeat, was not a flop) he still makes an ordinary film that little bit more extraordinary, because he just has that effortless class about him.<br/><br/>As you'd expect, the films narrative is as predictable as day turns to night.<br/><br/>White joins a school that isn't the best in the world. He sees potential in a few students, and learns of their hardship, he forms a cross country team, much to the frustration of family, colleagues. They get mocked by the river, better school, and fail their first attempt.<br/><br/>Them there is a big montage, the voice of the group has a hissy fit, goes home and fights with his family. Costner bumps into him, they a have a conversation, and you know what? he rejoins the team and they do much better, and decide to have a party. After all the people Costner was alienated against at first have formed a big bond with him and his family, and all is well.<br/><br/>But then something happens, Costner loses faith and then it's his turn to have a conversation with the student. You can pretty much guess the rest.<br/><br/>It's a safe film for sure. The true story of a struggling group of sports people has been done to death, from Cool Runnings to Remember The Titans, it's a paint by numbers narrative that hasn't, and probably never will be be changed.<br/><br/>Because it always works.<br/><br/>Costner is fantastic as always, and although it will disappear without a trace, it's one of those films that will appear on TV one Sunday afternoon, you will come across it halfway through, watch it, and know exactly what has happened, and what will happen within a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>It's uplifting stuff, without being too sugar coated, and you get the obligatory clip of the real life people at the end, just in case there are a few doubters in the audience.<br/><br/>Another safe family film from Disney.<br/><br/>I 'lapped' it up."
"FeatherlessBiped","6","14","20","5 December 2015"," Nice performances & scenery, cartoonish plot touches
","I had read the story of Jim White and the McFarland cross country team long before the movie came out. I was glad to see it made into a feature film, but Disney's heavy hands keep it from being fully satisfying.<br/><br/>Most of the actors playing larger roles acquit themselves well. Yes, Kevin Costner is his overly familiar world-weary self, but there's always a certain charm in seeing him inhabit that role. Many of the young men portraying McFarland's runners are both charming and believable, and some of the quirky townspeople (such as the mother of three runners and the owner of the local variety store) add nice depth to the story.<br/><br/>In addition, the scenery is interesting, from the running trails to the fields where the McFarland runners pick crops.<br/><br/>One real turnoff was when, repeatedly, opposing runners were shown talking smack before the start of races, and opposing coaches made snarky comments about the McFarland team. I've coached youth sports for many years and am accustomed to seeing much better sportsmanship than that. The movie makers apparently needed to set up cartoonish villains so that the audience would root even harder for the good guys.<br/><br/>Another clunker came at the first race, the ""Palo Alto Invitational."" The race director was surprised when McFarland showed up - but if it was an ""invitational,"" then either they'd been invited (so he shouldn't have been surprised) or they hadn't been (in which case they had no business going to the race).<br/><br/>This was a generally pleasant two hours, and it was good to know that the basic heartwarming events took place in real life. Could have been better (or at least less bad in some parts), but it was OK. I recommend you find the story ""Running for Their Lives"" by Gary Smith, the captivating real-life tale of Jim White and McFarland (told as only the brilliant Smith could)."
"santiagocosme","6","10","14","16 August 2015"," Don't run away from this movie.
","The thought of a movie about running can be off putting, but personally I feel that you should give this movie a chance. <br/><br/>You won't be surprised that much by what happens as the structure of it is similar to hundreds of other flicks: the typical success story of a bunch of kids you would not bet $5 on. In this case, they have the gift of running, and their trainer (Kevin Costner) is the man to lead them. By the way, after so many years, I still don't know what to think about Kevin Costner. Is he a good actor? or is he just lucky to still get some roles? I haven't got a clue, but either way, his acting will not spoil the movie. <br/><br/>Since it's based on real events, you'll probably watch it out curiosity and forgive any lack of cinematographic quality. You should find it up-lifting and a good enough watch."

","OK, so I'm old, white and a native Texan. That doesn't mean I'm a bigot, racist, or stupid. I rarely go to movies anymore because I'm not interested in space creatures, zombies, excessive violence etc. I will pay to see good movies about interesting people and real life events, with good acting.<br/><br/>McFarland definitely met my requirements and is the best movie I've seen in a very long time!<br/><br/>When I hear my neighbors complain about Mexican immigrants and why they should be deported etc. I tell them to ""Pick your own damn lettuce then - or pay $6.00 for it!"" Most of us have no clue what their lives are like and certainly aren't tough enough to handle it.<br/><br/>I don't remember ever seeing a Keven Costner film I thought was awful. I heard so many negative comments about Waterworld that I didn't watch it for years. Finally gave in to test it, and actually thought it was rather good. <br/><br/>My son and his family also saw McFarland and they thought it was excellent as well. I'm very glad my teen grandchildren got to see it and hope other teens do as well."

","Greetings again from the darkness. ""A Disney movie"" was once synonymous with good-hearted family fare. Even though the lure of big box office has caused the studio to expand their film boundaries a bit, no one does it better when the material is a heart-warming, inspiring story  especially if based on a true story. This latest has less in common with The Mighty Ducks, and more with Miracle, The Rookie, and Dreamer.<br/><br/>Based on a true story that began in 1987, Kevin Costner plays high school coach Jim White, who after a couple of unfortunate incidents, finds himself with a not so desirable teaching/coaching gig in the San Joaquin Valley in central California – specifically the poverty stricken farming community of McFarland. To say that life is hard in McFarland is a bit of an understatement. The families are mostly Hispanic and heavily dependent on crop picking. Once the kids are age 10, they are put to work in the fields before and after school.<br/><br/>Toting their prejudices, Coach White and his wife (Maria Bello) and two daughters arrive as outsiders, but quickly discover their neighbors are very proud people who value family and community. Coach also discovers that the area boys have developed a natural ability to run distances in the heat, so he forms a school cross country team, and the rest is literally history. The runners dominate the California state meet by winning 9 of the next 14 years, and many of the boys go off to college – something previously not even a remote dream for most.<br/><br/>Since this is Disney, most of the jagged edges are rounded off. Crime, discrimination, politics, racism, and poverty are present, but do not receive much attention. Director Niko Caro (Whale Rider, North Country) does nice work in keeping the story grounded and focused on the individuals. We get a feel for the skepticism and family obstacles faced by this first group of runners. More importantly, we witness the pride and involvement as the boys begin to have some success, and the sense of belonging that sneaks up on White and his family.<br/><br/>Costner does get a shot at a motivational speech, but it's small in scope and wonderfully centered on what the boys have accomplished, rather than some unrelatable shot at changing the world. Seeing him on a ""Barbie"" bike brings a laugh, as does some of the high school boy chatter directed at their duck-out-of-water coach. We don't really get to know the individual boys too much (some are actors, some are actual McFarland students), but the end credit video recap of where they are now (27 years later) really hits home as to the importance of guidance and mentorship for youngsters.<br/><br/>The film is extremely pleasant and the story's roots in the real world lend credence to the inspirational message and underdog-overcoming-obstacles story. It's also a reminder that opportunity to make a difference is all around us. Just look what Jim White and runners have accomplished!"

","McFarland, USA is a city in California that to this day has a sizable Hispanic population, many of whom work as migrant farm workers picking crops. ""McFarland"" is a film that tells the story of Coach White, a passionate coach who gets fired from his football coaching gig at a wealthy high school when he escalates a fight between him and his players to violence. The wealthy high school football players seemed more concerned about the after party than the game. Athletics for these players is a prestige thing that has nothing to do with sportsmanship. After a series of disrespectful actions, Coach White snaps and subsequently gets fired. But as Coach White reflects later to another coach when he arrives at his new school, ""It's not the fight in the dog coach, it's the dog in the fight...depends on the size of the dog..."".<br/><br/>Coach White moves to Cliff Avenue in a Hispanic neighborhood with his wife and two daughters. When he first arrives in the new neighborhood, one of his daughters questions if the family had ended up in Mexico. The Whites struggle at first to fit into their new neighborhood. Meanwhile, the high school students in the small Hispanic town of McFarland have their own struggle. Most of the students at MacFarland have jobs. Athletics isn't even an option for many of them because they come from the fields to go to school and run back to the fields when class gets outs. Many become adults in those very fields. Unless a prison gets to them first. It is a hard life which stands in stark contrast to the lives of Coach White's previous students. He begins to see the athletic potential in his hardworking students and questions the temporary nature of his transitory job as coach at MacFarland. <br/><br/>In the classic Disney fashion, Coach White's new community welcomes him. His neighbor even plants him a tree and tells him, ""in five years senor you're going to have some nice shade"". The simple transitions in the film show the migrant worker's lives with Hispanic music in the background. The scenes are poetic. But the most beautiful part of the film is the raw determination of the high school students trying to compete in a sport and environment that sets them up for failure. A boy named Thomas Valles becomes a de facto leader of the team after Coach White catches the high school student running at 12 miles an hour. This same boy shows up to practice with bruises because he gets his dad to punch him instead of a wall since as a migrant worker his father needs his hands to work. It isn't until coach White works a whole day as a migrant worker himself, picking crops getting paid by the field instead of by the hour that he begins to understand the plight of his athletes. <br/><br/>In the spirit of Stand and Deliver Coach White understands that he needs to go beyond his position as coach for these students. He begins to treat them like his own. During one scene, he rushes to a park without enough money for the entrance fee and tells the officer, ""I've got five dollars and seven kids who have never seen the ocean"". He brings his students to the beach. <br/><br/>Eventually, McFarland becomes more than a temporary home for Coach White and his family. It becomes their community, one which adopts them as warmly as they adopted it. The family moments such as the father's speech at his daughters quinceañera will tug at your heartstrings. Coach White disproves Thomas Valles' initial belief that, ""Nobody stays in McFarland unless they have to. Because there is nothing American dream about this place"". This film is based off a true story and Coach White ended up at McFarland coaching at the town's high school long after better prospects opened up for him. By the end, Coach White recognizes that these kids at McFarland cherish cross country and athletics, something he admits is a privilege many take for granted."

","A coach inspiring a group of underprivileged kids to form a team to beat well-heeled rivals has been done before, but ""McFarland, USA"" does it well. <br/><br/>Set in the 1980's, Jim White (Kevin Costner) takes a job as assistant sports coach at McFarland High, a mainly Hispanic school in Los Angeles. However the area seems too dangerous for his wife and young daughter, while scholastic achievement and prowess on the sporting field are not priorities for the students, many of whom work in the surrounding fields as pickers to help their families. <br/><br/>However when White realises that some of his students are strong runners, he creates a cross-country running team to take on the wealthier schools that dominate the sport. Then as White and his family get to know the people in the area, they feel a sense of belonging, which they hadn't felt before. <br/><br/>The film builds to an emotional, uplifting climax. Although a fair amount of rearranging of the facts took place, it is reassuring to learn that the story is essentially true. <br/><br/>The film gets its message across without being preachy. At the end, when the actors segue into the real people, the theme behind the film becomes clear; if you can engage people and focus them on a goal and build self-esteem then they are more likely to become the citizens you want. <br/><br/>This is a movie that sneaks up on you. Kevin Costner plays it low-key. One can see how an overly effusive approach to teaching would in reality have seemed fake to students wary of anything false. <br/><br/>Maria Bello is perfect as Cheryl Whitel it's not a big role but she lifts any film she is in. Valente Rodriguez almost steals the show as the likable Principal Carmillo. <br/><br/>Long distance running takes on an almost mystical significance in movies. Possibly the link with cross country-running, the endurance required and the sense of achievement it generates was one of the reasons nearly all the boys in Coach White's squad went on to lead meaningful lives. <br/><br/>A football team or a baseball team would also have had a galvanising effect, but endurance sports are different – it could have a lot to do with endorphins cutting in creating a natural high and great self-confidence. <br/><br/>McFarland is a movie with a heart; it's a winner all round."

There he discovers buried potential in several high school boys, and slowly turns them into a track team and brings them closer than even he could ever imagine.<br/><br/>Hands down my favourite movie of 2015. No matter how many times I watch it, I still get chills at the end. <br/><br/>It's funny how many reviews read something like this ""predictable, routine, generic"" etc however whilst it's true that Disney's sports movie formula is pretty well-worn. You can apply this plot to a lot of movies ""Fish out of water comes and turns a team of losers into champions while learning valuable life lessons along the way."" Yes It happens every time. However McFarland USA is a true story. Kevin Costner is playing a real man in Jim White, and no they didn't change his name to make it for better. <br/><br/>I can't speak highly enough about this movie. It's in my Top 10 Kevin Costner movies.<br/><br/>""That's not Danny Diaz....... THATS NOT DANNY DIAZ!!!"""
"Buddy-51","7","5","6","13 September 2015"," Predictable but manages to hit most of the right notes
","We all know the drill by now: a teacher, usually white (the one exception seems to be Sidney Poitier in ""To Sir With Love""), is sent to teach in a tough, predominately minority high school, filled with troubled teens and burned-out faculty members. At first, the hapless newbie is met with bemusement and resistance from the recalcitrant students, but, eventually, said teacher ultimately earns the trust and respect of all, often leading the kids and their school onto victory and glory in some sort of high-stakes contest (sporting event or whiz-kid competition, preferably). The granddaddy of them all, 1955's ""The Blackboard Jungle,"" established the blueprint that all the others that have come after it have felt obliged to follow. Indeed, the narrative arc is so familiar to us by now that only the names, places and specific details offer anything in the way of novelty.<br/><br/>Enter ""McFarland, USA,"" the umpteenth version of the above scenario, this one featuring Kevin Costner as Jim White, a real life PE teacher/football coach who, out of desperation, takes a position at a high school in an impoverished farm community near Bakersfield, California circa 1987. The population of the town is composed almost exclusively of first and second generation Hispanic immigrants, mostly pickers, leaving White, his wife (Maria Bello) and their two young daughters (""Homeland's"" Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher) feeling a bit like fish-out-of-water in their new home.<br/><br/>When he discovers that several young men in his PE class are phenomenal runners, Mr. White decides to start a cross country team at the school, bucking a skeptical principal, school board and rival teams every step of the way - not to mention straightening out the various personal and familial problems of the boys on his team (as well as coping with his own inadequacies as a father to his teenage daughter). Yet, after some early setbacks competing against a series of snooty white schoolsah well, you get the picture. And, of course, there's the inevitable offer of a position at a ""better"" school, leaving White with the dilemma of either leaving his charges in the lurch or staying on for the long haul.<br/><br/>The thing is, though, that, while it would be easy to dismiss ""McFarland USA"" for its lack of freshness and originality, formulas are formulas for a reason, I suppose, and that is because they work. So, while you can resist it all you want, in the end you'll probably find yourself cheering on the boys as they cross the finish line, just as you'll be championing Mr. White for his ability to lead and inspire his charges both on the field and off. In short, though your brain may be looking for ways to reject ""McFarland USA,"" your heart will be telling you to let it in. It's pretty easy to predict which will emerge victorious in that battle.<br/><br/>Nobody does the inspirational phoenix-rising-from-the-ashes bit better than Costner, and he is backed by a first-rate cast of young performers (Carlos Pratts, Johnny Ortiz, Rafael Martinez, Hector Duran, Sergio Avelar, Michael Aguero) who exude both naturalism and charm in their roles as disadvantaged youth who find meaning and pride in personal accomplishment and camaraderie. The movie also does a nice job showing how the bridges between various cultures are best built on the willingness to suspend preconceived judgments and to be open to new experiences."

While watching there is a way you want it to end, and you are right there training and running with them hoping for the outcome you desire. The only bad I can say about it is that I liked his other ones better, but only because I like football and baseball more than running. That in no way diminishes the greatness of this movie though. Overall, Costner proves again why he is THE choice for sports movie actors. I give this an A."

He eventually turns, his attention from football to cross country, because he sees some potential in some of the students; despite having no experience in the sport. Ultimately, White is able to create a team of ragtag of runners, with high school, students: Thomas Valles (Carlos Pratts), Johnny Sameniego (Hector Duran), Jose Cardenas (Johnny Ortiz), Victor Puentes (Sergio Avelar), Damacio Diaz (Michael Aguero), David Diaz (Rafael Martinez) and last Danny Diaz (Ramiro Rodriguez) as they try their hardest in becoming the state champion. Centering on the concept of teamwork and cooperation. McFarland, USA is able to teach viewers on the values of solidarity, very well; not only when it comes to sports, but also when it comes to working together as a community. It also teach people, not to judge others by racial stereotypes. You see, this, with Coach White. While, he might be a little prejudiced at his Hispanic students at first; you really do see some character development from White toward the middle, despite Kevin Costner barely acting. You see him, warm up to them, and later helps the runners, run their best, realizing this is what makes them special. Yet, this movie has also invoked some groans among some critics who recognize its 'white savior' premise as tiresome and clichés. I have to somewhat agree with them, on that. The white savior rescuing people of color from their poor plight, trope has indeed been overdone to death. Still, this movie was still entertaining, even if the film's messianic portrayal of Coach Jim White leading a ragtag group of Latino cross country team from McFarland, California to the state championship is a bit predictable and safe. I just wish, the movie took more chances with the subject matter. The plot didn't seem to stand out, that much, besides the few drama with Jim White's family, but at least, they kinda made cross-country seem somewhat intense. Since the movie isn't a documentary, Hollywood did change a little bit of how the team got to championship. A good example is how Jim White even got to coach at McFarland High School. No, he wasn't fired from a number of teaching jobs prior to teaching at McFarland. Instead, he started teaching in the McFarland school district after graduating from Pepperdine University in 1964. During that time, white taught different subjects at numerous grade levels before starting his coaching career in 1980, not 1987 with cross-country. Another thing, about that, is the fact that White did not create the cross-country team at the school, but instead restarted it after it had been dropped for a year. He also taught the school's girl's cross-country team, despite only the boys' team being featured in the film. Regardless of that, all of the supporting actors playing the team members were very good in their limited role. It just some of them, really don't stand out. I really got confused on, who is who, at parts. I also believe, the movie didn't need to over-exaggerate some of them to do that. A good example is how they portrayed Danny Diaz (Ramiro Rodriguez). He wasn't overweight in real life, nor was the slower member on the team. He was in fact, one of the fastest people at McFarland High School. They portray him, a little too cartoony. Another thing, the film fails to notice, is how not all of the runners from the 1987 team were featured in the film. It would be nice to see, original runner, Luis Partida in the team, because he indeed help them, win. Despite that, David Diaz (Rafael Martinez) was a great replacement. Even if, he graduated the year before McFarland's first state title win in real life. The supporting actors that played Jim White's family was also amazing. It's nice to see that the character that Maria Bello plays is given more to do, than being a supporting wife to Costner's character. She gets her own sub-plot, with her, trying to get along with the women in her neighborhood. Even the child actors that play Jim's kids, were fine in their roles. I just wish, they were able to hired another actress to play Jim's other daughter, Tami. Her absence from this film, is a bit jarring. Yet, I can understand, why the filmmakers wanted to combined those two characters (Jamie & Tami) together. It does save time. Overall: This poignant, uplifting tale is very heart-warming and inspirational. While, it might not stand out, much compare to other Disney sport films. It's still worth checking out. I'm in it, for the long run."

","McFarland, USA was actually really good, which I was not expecting. Of course, I suppose I had been biased against it because it was filmed at my high school in the midst of my junior year, and the entire student body was annoyed that we had to put up with these giant wooden barriers with doorways cut into them that were set up in the busiest outdoor covered hallway, oftentimes couldn't use our office building (which is where the office scenes at the school were filmed), the front of the school, the service road (which was where they took the bus from to state), the football field/dirt track, the PE area (where they drank at the water fountain when the Diaz boys weren't there), and many other places. We could even hear them yelling ""McFarland!"" while we were in classes. I also remember that the day we heard Kevin Costner was there, my English teacher, Ms. Hill (a 5' nothing, 65 year old black woman) ran out of class as soon as the bell rang for nutrition and ran halfway across campus just to meet one of her favorite actors. That was a major feat, given that the halls were extremely congested for months because they left up the wooden structures.<br/><br/>In general, the entire student body was annoyed with the intrusion into our education for a movie about a track team?! Everyone thought it was dumb. (I didn't learn that it was actually about a cross country team until I sat down to watch the movie.) Given that the sport of choice at Cleveland was football, nobody was happy in the slightest. Then, we learned that it was about a Latino team dealing with racism in the sport, and most students were ok with it again, given that Cleveland is also located in a predominantly Latino area, and the majority of the student body reflects that, so everyone understood. Additionally, my brother ran track and cross country throughout middle and high school, so watching this movie with my family also added another layer to it because we recognized the places that the team ran as places my brother ran.<br/><br/>Given that I had so much bias against it because they filmed it at my school, it really says a lot that McFarland, USA ended up being a lot better than I expected it to be. It's pretty wholesome, even though it deals with serious subjects at times, like racism and the lives of pickers. It's also got moments of hilarity. All in all, not a bad way to spend a couple hours."

The movie focuses on a semi- urban locality McFarland that is a habitat for the immigrants' population of US. Here their survival depends upon agricultural produce and is not uncommon to view children entering the labor force at a very young age. <br/><br/>It is a boardroom management lesson – the character of Jim White. Call it circumstances or act of God he is supposed to train the students in American Foot Ball. It is public school where funding is a scarce resource and students less motivated to take up sports. All he understood was the children had a natural ability to run for their daily chores. He capitalized that aspect and trained them to their maiden 'Cross country race'. <br/><br/>We always need to see opportunity within our limited resources. Allowing ourselves to be stagnate and complaining leads us to depression. Life is never going to be linear and all I saw from the movie whether a teacher / team Leader should be in a position to impart knowledge and show us something best from the better. <br/><br/>The film will remain with me as an enjoyable and inspiration source.

","'MCFARLAND, USA': Three Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Disney's sports drama flick, based on a true story, about the high school coach of a Mexican-American cross country team, in a small California town in 1987. It stars Kevin Costner as the coach and was directed by Niki Caro (the director of such other critically acclaimed films as 2002's 'WHALE RIDER' and 2005's 'NORTH COUNTRY'). It was written by Christopher Cleveland, Bettina Gilois and Grant Thompson. I found the movie to be pretty routine, and clichéd, but not without it's moments. <br/><br/>Costner plays Jim White; a high school football coach who's forced to relocate his family to McFarland, California; after getting into trouble in Boise, Idaho (for being too rough on his players). It's a mostly Hispanic small town and Jim worries that, due to gang violence there, it might not be the safest place to raise his two daughters (Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher). He attempts to fit in, at the school, but once again gets into trouble; this time with the head football coach. After noticing what fast runners a lot of the students are, he asks the principal if he can start a cross country team. White then begins enlisting troubled, but very quick, students.<br/><br/>The story is an inspiring underdog tale, with a lot of heart, in classic sports film tradition. Costner is great in the leading role and the supporting cast, of mostly young unknown Hispanic actors, are all good too. The directing is decent, for this type of film, as well; but I think Caro's previous work is much better. While this movie goes through all the right motions, and does what it's basically supposed to, that's also (basically) all it does; there's nothing refreshing or original to it. I also found it quite boring, at times, due to it's clichéd nature and tired overused melodrama. It's an inspiring story though and Costner is especially good in it.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/IG_hW4WZgWE"

One of the first sites he sees at his new job as a Physical Education Teacher is mom picking up her three sons for their jobs as pickers after school. <br/><br/>But those three brothers turn out to be an integral part of the cross country running team that he creates for the school.

","I think I'm not the only one who's getting a little tired of the sports movie genre that we are seeing over and over again. While McFarland USA is definitely a clichéd sports movie, it's probably one of the better ones that I've seen in recent memories. The movie's about Jim White (Kevin Costner) who became the head coach of a cross country team in small high school in a small town filled with Mexican immigrants. I think what makes this movie stand apart from the other films is that the main characters, mainly the runners, are some of the most likable people. They have a very charismatic energy to them and they're really fun to see them interact with each other and their coach. It also helps that each one has a good amount of depth to them as well as we can see some of their personal dramas that they go through without being too heavy handed. This is well-shot film as they were able to make California a very good looking place and the music has a really cool Mexican vibe to it. Unfortunately, because it's a sports movie some of the plot points of the films were 100% predictable, especially at the last third of the movie, especially when some of the drama scenes felt forced at times. But overall, I think this is a really good film that I believe anyone can enjoy. Of course there are better sports movies out there but as is, it's worth checking out."

Inspired? Come and watch this positive-charged, entertaining, and moving film. You will cry, you will laugh. Seven boys, that clocked high-mileage every day from the fields to school, break the boundaries of impossibilities: thanks to the guidance of a phenomenal coach. Jim White (Kevin Costner) moves to McFarland after hitting rock-bottom in his career. But when he thought everything was lost, he discovers several almost-superhuman ""produce pickers,"" teenagers that have seeds of fine athletes in them.<br/><br/>""McFarland"" is a journey about the cultivation and harvest of talent. Along the way, we fall in love with the heart and the faith of a coach who changed an unmovable reality for a group of Hispanic High-Schoolers back in 1987. Along the way, we fall in love with the boys whose dreams and troubles and families, in turn, change the life realities of a coach and his own family. Along the way, we learn about cultural values. We also gain a new perspective on our produce: now we can imagine the working-hands and the hopeful-smiles behind each Californian cabbage or orange. Beautiful!<br/><br/>Although the plot is fairly predictable, it's full of conflict, bits of suspense, emotion, and plenty cross-country team cheering! <br/><br/>From the beginning, this story grabs my heart and runs with it! And it doesn't let go. I counted about ten favorite scenes that had me drying up my tears and smiling at the same time. The piercing poem. The cheerful ocean. The ""pretend"" hills. The kind gestures. And many more great scenes. Also, the landscapes and camera angles are breathtaking - the crops, the mountains, the roads, etc. <br/><br/>In this film, Kevin Costner is utterly illuminating. Once more, he shines. Costner shows the various facets of Jim White: the coach, the father, the neighbor, the mentor, and the man. The man that has to make tough choices for himself and for his family and for the community. The man looking for self-worth. He is down-to-earth (literally) and compassionate. Then we have the actors that play the running team: they are champion stars! These actors sowed soul and muscle and they harvested success. Their characters breathe authenticity and sentiment. Thomas Valles (Carlos Pratts), sums up the ""Cougars"" joys and pains and fears. I also loved Señora Diaz (Diana Maria Riva)--the lively mother and neighbor. The White family: Maria Bello (the wife), Morgan Saylor (the 15-year old daughter), and Elsie Fisher (the little daughter) give us honest and lovable characters. And of course, the rest of the supporting cast make this film the jewel it is. Even the chicken and the roosters add feathers of humor.<br/><br/>And the messages... I got chills with lines that shake the ""competitor"" in each of us. For instance, ""what is hard, is loosing when you haven't done enough."" Beautiful! <br/><br/>I also loved all the Mexican heritage-rich moments and the spicy music--especially the Luis Miguel song! <br/><br/>This is a truly memorable film. Why? Because it's a film about people believing in people. It's about forgetting boundaries and standards and following your heart. ""McFarland"" is about running after a dream.<br/><br/>Please watch it!<br/><br/>I can't wait to see it again and again.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading. <br/><br/>Cheers."
"StevePulaski","9","13","32","22 February 2015"," Informative and heartwarming without being condescending or emotionally manipulative - a mainstream rarity
","Letterboxd/Time Out film critic David Ehrlich has two very keen observations on Niki Caro's new film ""McFarland, USA."" For one, he states that it's another film in the quietly condescending line of films where a white man learns that people of other races are ""capable of being decent,"" in an oddly funny but surprisingly true manner, especially with Costner's ""Black or White"" still in multiplexes nationwide. And secondly, there's the fact that ""McFarland, USA,"" despite being a Disney film about a sport (in this case, cross country), there is not a single training montage whatsoever in the film.<br/><br/>Ehrlich, however, overlooked one detail and that's ""McFarland, USA"" is the best Disney sports film since ""Remember the Titans."" After last year's crushingly ordinary ""Million Dollar Arm,"" Disney rebounds with a film that not only understands its genre and the mental factor that comes into play for a cross country runner, but it understands minority culture very well, in this case, the life of Hispanic adolescents, who have been working in the fields since they were eleven and twelve years old. The film understands their roots, their struggles, and what it means for them to belong to something bigger than themselves, and it portrays such in a manner that isn't empty and emotionally-manipulative but rich with insight and humanity.<br/><br/>The film opens with Jim White (Kevin Costner), a hot-headed football coach for a high school team that is getting destroyed at half time. After an outburst leads to a physical altercation with a player, White is dismissed with another blemish on an already tattered record. The only work he can find is in the working poor town of McFarland, California, where he relocates his family. ""Are we in Mexico?,"" his teenage daughter asks as they are driving through the streets of McFarland, observing the high volume of Hispanics.<br/><br/>Upon relocation, White becomes the Earth science and physical education teacher for McFarland High School. After taking note that a gaggle of the kids in his P.E. class can run at unearthly speeds for multiple laps, he suggests to the already overwhelmed principal of the underfunded school if a cross country team could be implemented. Push comes to shove, compromises are made, and White becomes the one to create a cross country team and seek out seven runners to populate the team. The issue in gathering the faster runners is that many of them are self-proclaimed ""pickers,"" or teenagers that spend their mornings out picking crops in the field with the parents, doing exhausting manual labor that, in turn, puts food on their tables. White has to combat this element all while trying to give these kids something to be excited about.<br/><br/>The runners steal the show every chance they get, one of whom is Thomas Valles (Carlos Pratts), the team's fastest runner. Valles is a troublemaker, offputting, but greatly troubled by an absent, workaholic father and a family falling apart at the seams. Three other runners are the Diaz brothers, the athletic Damacio (Michael Aguero) and David (Rafael Martinez), and the heavyset Danny (Ramiro Rodriguez), who still bears enough motivation and heart to succeed.<br/><br/>I realize I may be summarizing ""McFarland, USA"" in what seems to be a posterbook of clichés, but the film's slick handling of tough subjects is anything but shortchanging. Quite frequently does the film shift its focus from Costner's White to the lives of the kids at hand, showing long hours in the picking fields along with stressful homelives that would break most privileged suburban children. These kids are warriors on the track and under their own roof, and the film does nothing but sympathize with their case rather than helplessly pitying them. Writers Christopher Cleveland, Bettina Gilois, and Grant Thompson also make it so it doesn't seem as if White is the ""white knight"" for these boys, as the boys recognize such strong, moral values themselves throughout the film and White is simply a vehicle to discovering those, as well.<br/><br/>Costner's last film, ""Black or White,"" focusing on an ugly legal debate over the custody of Costner's interracial granddaughter, released not even a month ago in the United States, was a lukewarm drama with race as a key factor, but condescending in its portrayal of many of its black characters. ""McFarland, USA"" is the complete opposite, filling the adolescent characters with heart, humanity, and a strong sense of character rather than making them sink with their lesser traits.<br/><br/>This is a crowd-pleaser of a film if I've ever seen one, and not the kind where the crowd is so pleased they forget to overlook huge issues like emotional manipulation, oversimplification, and blatant sociological flaws in depicting a culture or a group. ""McFarland, USA"" is an uncommonly strong film, not so much in its plot and its characters, all of which variations of things seen in the past or just familiar by convention, but there is such a strong depiction of culture and character in the film that that particular element is easy to ignore, given all the greatness on screen so pervasively."

It's terribly sad to see the state of the town and how the poor residents survive, when the rest of America is thriving. Costner's character is unaware of their struggle when he first arrives, as most of the viewers will be, but as he gets to know his neighbors and bonds with the community, he (and we) are exposed to their cultural traditions.<br/><br/>If you're not drawn to the movie because of the sports, or the inspirational story, or because you like true stories, or you like Kevin Costner, I'll give you one more reason to watch it: Maria Bello's costumes.

The film makes beautiful use of light and makes the flat fields of southern California look stunning. The film is refreshing in portraying Anglos and Mexicans as trying to get along. The Mexicans might be poor, but their community is close and loving. There is lots of gentle humour and a bit of the coach being a fish out of water. But generally, the outcome of this movie is not really in doubt. But it's a well written and heartfelt movie, about teenagers trying to improve their lot in life. The message is, there is no way around working hard towards what you want to achieve, and doing your best. And the support of being in a team is amazing.

","Hollywood has been good in one area a couple decades into the 21st century. It has turned out some very good sports films based on true stories. ""McFarland, USA"" is one. The movie was made by Disney in 2015, from a screenplay that was being developed since 2004. It's based on a true story of a high school teacher, Jim White, who made championship cross-country teams in the mid-1980s at a small California high school. The town of McFarland is in the farm area of central California, north of Bakersfield. The high school is largely Hispanic.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner heads the cast as White, and all turn in fine performances. This is a very good drama, historical and biographical film. It is peppered with small doses of humor. The production qualities are superb. As with most such films, this one has been changed from fact to fiction in places. But, it tells a good story about a coach, a town and a high school team. <br/><br/>Some of the fictional changes including White having been fired from different teaching jobs before going to McFarland. In reality, he began there in 1964 after he graduated from Pepperdine University. White taught different classes and grades until 1980 when he began coaching. When he noticed the speed of some of the kids, he decided to start cross-country running which the school had dropped the previous year. The film is just about the boys' team, but he started both boys and girls teams, and took both of them to the Cayucos beach during the 1985 season. <br/><br/>White had three daughters, not two as in the movie. And they were older in real life. At the time of the cross-country championships, the girls were in college. <br/><br/>The move was a hit and apparently led to increased interest in cross- country running in schools around the country. This is a good film that should be of special interest to young teens. <br/><br/>Here are a couple of favorite lines from the film. Cheryl White, ""Fourth place? That's not too shabby. Jim, ""Four out of four – also known as last.""<br/><br/>Jim White, ""Tell your father I said it was an honor to be invited into his home."" David Diaz, ""Dad, he said it was an honor to be invited into your home."" Senor Diaz, ""Tell him I said 'Thanks!'"""

Despite this formula being overused and predictable, add in a great lead such as Denzel Washington, Kurt Russell or in this case Kevin Costner, and time and time again Disney will show you that it still works.<br/><br/>Costner plays Jim White, a football coach with a bad track record in previous coaching positions. Following this incident, he and his family move to McFarland, California: a rural, impoverished and primarily Hispanic community. He starts his new job as the assistant football coach, as well as taking up the life science/PE teacher position. It is clear from the start that White does not want to live in McFarland, and will accept a better job if the opportunity arises.<br/><br/>During PE class one day, Jim observes two Hispanic boys running laps. His daughter comments on how fast the boys run, and Jim notices the stamina that they possess. After continuing to watch them, he approaches the principal of the school requesting permission to start a cross-country team with these young men to compete in upcoming state championships.<br/><br/>Coach White does more than simply coach a cross-country team, however. He invests in the lives of the boys and provides them with greater opportunities that would not have been possible otherwise. He also learns humility and the value of hard work from the guys on his team, who spend their mornings working in their parents' fields from the crack of dawn until they go to school.<br/><br/>Costner does an excellent job in portraying the various struggles that Jim White endured to gain the trust of the guys on his team. Jim holds nothing back in guiding his team to excellence academically, athletically and as upstanding young men. The members of White's team, played by Carlos Pratts, Johnny Ortiz, Rafael Martinez, Sergio Avelar, Ramino Rodriguez and Hector Duran, are top notch as well.<br/><br/>The film shows the hardships that the boys and their families faced as Latino migrant workers during this time period. The town and a majority of its families are plagued with a seemingly endless generational cycle of poverty, and their work is comprised of grueling, long hours with minimal pay. The writing by Christopher Cleveland and direction by Niki Caro adequately display this struggle. <br/><br/>While the writing is solid, the film takes a little while to get going. The first 30 minutes of the movie leading up to White forming the cross-country team dragged on for me, however the information presented at the beginning is necessary build-up to the main plot, which is more than worth the wait. Overall, the direction by Caro is superb, and I am looking forward to seeing her future directorial work.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the film is commendable. Most of the locations where the competitions take place include rolling hills and lush countryside in addition to a few urban areas. The enormous hills at the last location the team competes at are stunning to view from a distance, and the camera-work in the movie captures its beauty effectively.<br/><br/>While ""McFarland, USA"" does not bring any original ideas to the table, the execution and effectiveness of the film is a pleasant surprise. Fans of Costner and sports movies alike will not be disappointed."
"RossRivero99","9","1","1","3 March 2017"," One of the best sports dramas I've seen in a long time
","Niki Caro's ""McFarland USA"" is a film filled with pure heart and soul, dedication, determination, and pure inspiration, which this is a movie that is also based on a true story. The movie stars Kevin Costner as Jim White a high-school teacher who just got fired from his job as a football coach and takes up a job as a cross-country coach. After Coach White assembled a cross-country team the team isn't really that inspired at first, but then White pushes them to their real hidden potential so that they can perform as well as they can and how he would want them to in cross-country meets. With this movie Niki Caro who directed the movie really proves she knows how to direct a very well made sports movie. While I was watching the movie I was reminded of another sports movie called ""Remember the Titans"" (2000) which was made 15 years earlier with Denzel Washington in the leading role. I was reminded of that movie for two main reasons, the first one being because the things that coaches White and Boone are that when they started in their respective sports as the new coach in town everyone practically hated them and then came to respect them, and the second reason being that both White and Boone pushed them to their limits with their approaches being totally different with White being more laid back and encouraging, and Boone being tough and hard as nails, as well as being very strict. This movie also happens to be one of the best sports movies ever made. Kevin Costner gives one of the best performances of his career as a simple but flawed man who proved that his coaching skills were still good. This is a great movie as well as a near masterpiece that shouldn't be missed at all, and it is even a gem of a movie for all kids to enjoy."

","Nothing wrong to call it an another version of 'Spare Parts', but it dealt with a different subject. It is a biographical-sport film, about a running race team involving seven high school students from one of the poorest towns in America, McFarland. But the tale begins with the coach Jim White, who finally arrives with his family there after got fired frequently in the other cities. Not intended to stay for a long period, but he has no other choice. He finds hard to fit in the society and get along with his students, but he manages to get going when he forms a team for the upcoming cross-country running race. So their journey puts the small town on the map.<br/><br/>A very inspiring film, not just sports personalities, but anyone who wants to achieve in life should see it. So a must see film for the students and the youngsters. It is not just about the sport, but culture and society. The first act was an introduction, where and how everyone comes together was revealed. Followed by the middle part focused more on the game. Getting prepared for it and facing other troubles that stands obstacle to it. And finally in the third act, it kind of loses what originally intended as a theme, but brings the social matter into it before getting back to where it belongs to curtain.<br/><br/>There was lots of modification in the cinema version compared to the original story. Characters, locations, events, all were kind of randomised from the actuality to the different timelines just to tell a good story. After all, this is a Disney film and Disney always seeks a decent family theme, yet it still remains true to the real. From the New Zealand director of 'Whale Rider' fame, another brilliant film. Apart from the super Kevin Costner and his family, the rest of the cast was so perfect. One of the best sport-dramas of the year and Disney done it again. You no need to analyse it to choose, just go for it and it won't disappoint you.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I found this a really engaging and interesting movie.<br/><br/>I'd like to feel that this is a bit of an insight into the town and its story, as so many other reviews have referred to the real story behind it. This adds to the flavour for me.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the characters, I enjoyed the story, and I liked the way the team built a relationship and the coach played his part. It's like a few other movies, but still individual and interesting.<br/><br/>The ending may be a little predictable, but I found this a fun tale, one I'd watch with the kids and probably watch again.<br/><br/>A fun family movie."
"eddie_baggins","7","1","1","24 January 2016"," A typical Disney sports movie, but that's OK
","Ah the Disney sports movie. I'm sure we've all got our favourite (mines a tie between Remember the Titans and the Mighty Ducks if you're wondering) and I'm sure we all know what to expect from the Mouse House's sports tinged productions, from trials over adversity's, music scored training monologues and fine use of poetic license to tell true stories in a Hollywood themed way. The genre is a well tried and well liked staple of movie fans and McFarland, USA is a finely tuned example of a cookie cutter sports movie that never becomes anything more than we'd expect, and that's absolutely fine.<br/><br/>The presence of New Zealand born director Niki Caro is certainly a help to McFarland's non-lofty ambitions, a director who has seen great success in dramas like Whale Rider and North Country and she brings a neat feel to the film here that helps cover up some of the films more pure Disney cheese moments like Kevin Costner's Jim White's daughters birthday bash or some stench ridden dialogue that just does not in the slightest ring true. Without Caro on board behind the scenes this tale of cross country runners from the harsh working class town of McFarland could've really been lost in an abundance of Disney fluff but with her fine work and that of Kevin Costner's, the film coasts by as a likable and fun tale.<br/><br/>Once the biggest movie star in the world, the last few years have seen Kevin Costner try his best to once more become relevant and while The Company Men and to a lesser extent Man of Steel are good examples of decent filmmaking, McFarland is quite possibly his most assured film role in some time and reminds us all that he has a unique presence on camera that is put to good use in his Coach White's dealing with his rag tag group of cross country runners who mostly hail from poor Mexican families who rely on fruit picking for a living. Whenever Coach White and the boys take centre stage or even the town of McFarland itself, the film really becomes a blast.<br/><br/>Filmed with a nice energy, McFarland, USA is a likable and enjoyable sports movie romp that delivers a telling of a true life tale that will bring a smile to even the unhappiest of faces. After many years of Disney sports movies and sports movies in general, you should go into this film under no illusions as to what you're going to get and the results will be exactly what the movie doctor has ordered.<br/><br/>3 ½ enthusiastic flag waving spectators out of 5"
"Solnichka","10","1","1","12 January 2016"," Formulaic yet perfect nonetheless
","Seriously, this movie busts out all the stereotypes, and it's still emotionally engaged and heartwarming—even after multiple viewings. Costner is in his element here, in a sports movie. He was always at his best in sports movies. The storyline is predictable, but you don't care when you watch—because it's an awesome feel-good story. <br/><br/>The visuals are good, and even though you know where the story is going, the acting is good enough to make you care about the characters—specifically the boys on the team and their families. Certain scenes will bring a tear to your eye every time you watch, and the movie doesn't lose its grip on you until the credits run.<br/><br/>The only real negative is the actress playing the older daughter; the writers had to make her into a 21st-century teenager instead of the 1980s teenager she should have been. Writers do this to make the film more relatable to a modern audience, but ... yeah. She's too good at being a brat, just like she was on the Showtime series she was in (""Homeland"")."
"gradyharp","10","1","1","30 December 2015"," 'Uno, dos, tres – McFarland'
","New Zealand director Niki Caro (Whale Rider North Country, A Heavenly Vintage) adds another success to her resume with this moving portrayal of a true story about a coach and his team in 1987 overcoming odds and learning trust, hope, and a belief in attainable goals. Based on a story by Bettina Gilois and Christopher Cleveland who also wrote the screenplay with Grant Thompson, the film may be overly long, but the emotional impact is so strong that the viewer stays with every minute of it without lapses.<br/><br/>The year is 1987 and Jim White (Kevin Costner) moves his wife (Maria Bello) and two daughters (Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher) after losing his last job as a football coach because of anger management related causes. McFarland, CA is in the San Joaquin Valley, an agricultural community that is basically populated with migrant workers who make their living form harvesting crops (it is one of the poorest cities in the country). He is at the end of his rope, feeling that this assignment is his only hope for supporting his family. He struggles, fails as a football coach but gets the idea of having a cross-country track team when he observes the stamina of the young lads running after being up early to pick crops. He turns seven students with no hope into one of the best cross-country teams, learning as much about equality and fulfillment of goals as his runners do.<br/><br/>In addition to the interpersonal reactions among the students and Jim's family (his friends create a Quinceañera for Jim's 15 year old daughter) there are many moments of inspiring beauty in this radiant film – not the least of which is a letter written by one of the runners: 'We fly like blackbirds through the orange groves, floating on a warm wind. When we run, we own the earth. The land is ours. We speak the birds' language. Not immigrant no more. No stupid Mexicans. When we run, our spirits fly. We speak to the gods. When we run, we are the gods.'<br/><br/>This is a moving film, so very timely during this struggle with border problems and immigration and racial distrust. Films like this serve a purpose far greater than mere entertainment."

","I loved the movie because it had a blend of sports, emotions and the story of this underdog running team. A team that rises from the dust to stun the world with their skills. Reminds me of the simple privileges I take for granted (the fruits we eat are someone's handwork) and just the basic necessity of living (shoes, water, and other facilities). I myself have worked and studied at a University at the same time but I can never come close to those people do to survive. Only a person who has seen them will know, how much heart it takes to do what they do. And to top it all off, they are the most humble, down to earth people in the world. You want to know why Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and other developing or under-developed countries do well in sports and other events, its not because they have good players, its because they have a sense of communism. I have never seen a community as close as these countries have in a western country. We (and I include myself) have forgotten what it feels like to live in a community. This movie teaches a lot of things, you can watch it for fun and motivation but I took a greater lesson out of this. A SENSE OF BELONGINGNESS can do wonders to the world. I would suggest you to take 140 Min's out of your time just to watch and learn from this. Also you might need a tissue box at the end if you are an emotional person. :D"

He actually goes out and not only lives among these people; he works in the fields as well.

","This was a pretty decent movie. It had sports, humor, good acting, and a good story behind the action.<br/><br/>The subtle political digs the movie got in were a bit annoying and in most cases, pretty unrealistic. I'll list the most unbelievable things in the film.<br/><br/>1.) When Mr. White or Blanco (Costner) goes to the Diaz bros. house to try and convince their parents to let them run, he and the rest of the family gorge on what seems like hundreds of flautas and enchiladas, there are even left overs. Outside, The Diaz father says something along the lines of ""my boys running means less help in the fields which means I can't put food on the table..."" Well sure, when you eat a freaking 10 course meal, it's going to be hard to keep food on the table..That made me laugh out loud at how unbelievable it was.<br/><br/>2.) After the Whites' daughter is attacked in an apparent gang retaliation, the mom seems more concerned about what the locals think and not coming off as ""prejudiced,"" than her daughter's safety. I don't know about you, but if my daughter got stabbed in the leg, I'd be a whole lot less concerned with what the locals thought of me than getting the hell out of dodge.<br/><br/>3.) Javi or Thomas Velez' cousin claims that he is not a gangsta after Coach White apologizes for stereotyping him, but then is attacked in a gang retaliation...Hmmmm. Yeah...not a gang member at all..<br/><br/>4.) The female teacher/administrator, whatever she is... (besides an atrocious actress lol) seem to serve only to lay out the plot and make fun of Mr. White. It is a lame plot device that serves no purpose other than exposition.<br/><br/>As for political statements...We get it...White people can't work in the fields and ""immigrants,"" do jobs that we could never do.<br/><br/>Except no...Ever read ""Grapes of Wrath,"" or been back to the Midwest or Northeast? Plenty of white people and families work their own farms and have for hundreds of years so PLEASE, Enough with this crap. Many Mexican illegal immigrants work hard, but they also undercut wages and take jobs of citizens who used to work in those professions (hospitality, agriculture, fast food industry, etc). I'm not buying that broad statement from politicians, popular opinion, OR in this case...film makers.<br/><br/>I want to leave this review on a positive note. I loved the message of getting an education and misguided youth striving for greatness. I could have done without the overt illegal immigration messages, but overall McFarland was an entertaining, feel good movie with likable characters. I won't watch it again, but I enjoyed watching it with my family. There are better sports movies, and there are far worse ones."

"spencer-w-hensley","9","0","0","8 April 2020"," Wonderful movie that should have been a huge comeback for Costner as a leading man
","I absolutely love this movie. Maybe I am a tad biased because I actually only live about 50 minutes away from the McFarland of the title, so the culture of the San Joaquin Valley where the movie takes place as well as some of the details of Hispanic culture were very familiar to me. Sure it's a predictable and formulaic story, but even so I have rarely felt a deep connection to a movie of this formula as I have to this one. I thought this movie would be a huge smash when it was released and would revive Kevin Costner as a leading man. Keeping in mind of course his career tanked badly after 1995's Waterworld and although he has had hits in supporting roles like Man of Steel and Hidden Figures both of which were huge hits, he has never found a huge hit sadly in the last two decades as a leading actor. I thought this would have been that huge hit that would have revitalized him as a leading man, but it was only a modest box office success sadly, and Costner's career remains exactly where it was before the release of this movie. He has made some poor career choices since the mid-90's but this film was not one of them, and this should have been a much bigger hit. I think a lot of the reason why this film didnt do as well as I anticipated was because audiences were tired of the same old Disney sports movie formula. Well this movie has more depth than would be expected. This has insight into every one of its characters and breaks away from the traditional sports movie formula. Perhaps if you are not familiar with Central California culture that could have been another reason why it didnt catch on with audiences. This movie was huge in the area I live and played in theaters for over three months, but it was nowhere as big elsewhere. Still this is an absolute treasure, with Costner at his absolute best. I hope he can make a comeback eventually as a leading man. But most importantly this is a magnificent film in every way that should have made him the big star he was decades ago. If you haven't seen it and think it will be another Costner stinker watch it and be proven wrong. If you think the story will be predictable from beginning to end you will be pleasantly surprised."

","Again, Kevin Costner stands for high quality. Unlike many sports dramas that celebrate the winners rising from ashes with much melodrama, this movie keeps its feet on the ground. Winning doesn't come overnight, but is a path of development for both parties: the runners and their coach. The quality storyline of McFarland follows this path, yet without boring repetition nor lengthy distracting side-plots. The cultural gap between the Hispanic runners and their American coach is at the centre of this development. If you want an ongoing 90min winner's high you may prefer another movie."

The football team he was supposed to coach stinks, and he proposes a cross country team because he sees these kids running fast and far.<br/><br/>The rest you can imagine, again, as a typical Disney film. How far can these kids go, how fast, can they hope to break the cycle of unbelievable poverty of migrant pickers. The depiction of the kids' lives is palpable - unbelievably hard-working kids, which forms the basis for their toughness.<br/><br/>Costner plays the role like a silk coat, sliding right in to the familiar good-guy role who is going to overcome all odds to be successful - see Field of Dreams. I like him much better in these types of roles as opposed to evil CIA-type killers. Leave those roles to others please.<br/><br/>The film has some minor sub plots, and gives a nice flavor for what the Mexican culture brings to our USA.

And I'm happy to say that their new film 'McFarland USA' is a welcome addition to this high level of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Usually in these Disney films, there are several aspects that can be traced through each film. You have an under-dog type team or athlete that has to overcome something in the sport as well as in their personal lives. You also have a losing team coming up the ranks to quite possibly be the best around. While these aspects of the story ring true as well in 'McFarland USA', the script and director Niki Caro ('Whale Rider') have executed a genuine and charming story that makes everything seem fresh as if you're seeing it for the first time. 'McFarland, USA' is actually a town in central California, where the local high school has won numerous cross- country running championships.<br/><br/>This film tells the story of how one coach led his students to victory. Jim White (Kevin Costner) is that coach, and what works so well here is that White has his own demons to deal with. He's been fired from numerous other coaching jobs or his hot temper and is not happy about relocating to the relatively poor community of McFarland, where like his last name, is the only white person in this small, yet lovable agricultural town. He soon realizes that some of the kids on the football team are excellent runners, because they have learned speed and agility from working every day with their parents in the green fields, harvesting food, thus having the idea for a great cross-country running team.<br/><br/>To take a different approach again, these students don't take to well to their coach at first, but when the students and their coach alike spend a few days in each other's lives, understanding what each person goes through a day, the team finally forms that tight bond, as they learn from each other. It all has a fairly predictable path (it's based on a true story), but it's still very satisfying to watch, because of the the performances and script. Costner is brilliant here, as he is no stranger to sport's films, but here, he wears his heart on his sleeve and leads this film to greatness.<br/><br/>Carlos Pratts plays the star runner who has has an attitude and struggles with his family and the team. Every emotion he conveys is powerful. I wish the beautiful Maria Bello had more to work with here, but she does turn in a solid performance. There are a few moments where Caro tries to hit you over the head with the heavy emotional crescendos, but you can't deny the pleasing way the film is told and all the rewards it delivers through the end. I guess you can say this is another Disney Sport's Classic you can add to your shelf."
"tory-s-anderson","9","0","0","17 July 2015"," McFarland, USA: about more than champions
","""Inspirational Films"" is a well-rehearsed genre which, after the likes of Hoosiers, Rudy, Rocky, Remember the Titans, and so many others, tends to be either loved or nauseating to viewers; for this reason I take them with moderation. But joining Kevin Costner for McFarland, USA–which means overcoming the terror of watching a Disney inspiration film with its tired-to-death formulas–brought me no regrets. Don't let the cliché subtitle, ""Champions can come from anywhere,"" deceive you. On the contrary, there's something special about this film, and the best things about it have little to do with becoming championship-winners.<br/><br/>The story takes up the familiar basic premise shared by sports and teacher movies: a low-in-life group of kids from a backward, bottom-of-the-barrel school. But it has a discernment of character that shows on two fronts. First, contrary to the usual Teacher-genre of bad kids that need to be redeemed (""To Sir, With Love"", ""Stand and Deliver"", two of my all-time favorites), from the start McFarland highlights the deep virtue that drives these boys, who make up for prospects and lack of ambition with work ethic and family devotion. Second, while other shows emphasize the teacher/coach bringing something out of the boys that they couldn't see, this show splits the bill with Coach White's own development beyond his volatile ego and racial ignorance to developing, and showing, genuine compassion for these boys–not magically appearing, innately possessed care, but empathy that he fights for and develops as the story progresses. At the same time he is overcoming his insecurities and struggling with providing and protecting a family his frustrated character has let down time and again.<br/><br/>There are certainly some flaws in the story. The already-long film didn't manage to return to the issue of getting the field-labor parents on-board with the idea of the boys going to college, and for all the quality of the boys it was still felt a little too fast/easy for Coach White to sell them on brutal runs, harsh-but-needed words, and a somewhat cantankerous persona. The White family, though central to the story and Coach White's identity and challenges, takes a back-seat place in character development, screen time, and scripting, so that they come off flat and as necessary scenery. All of these are the sort of things ""that would have been better in the book,"" but the film simply didn't have the resources to give them. But Costner did a fine job in the text-book roll of the firm-but-loving teacher, adding nuances from the humbleness he is painfully gaining through failure, the confusion of racial ignorance, and the concerns of a would-be provider, loving husband & father ""on a teacher's salary"", and never-before cross-country coach.<br/><br/>This show is a refreshing cut-above-the-norm because it's about more than winning a championship or bringing out buried virtues in the boys. It's about the assimilation of the White family into a new culture, gaining and sharing the love of a humble but vibrant community; it's about the adults, much more than the kids, overcoming prejudice; it's about learning, through sweat and labor and fears, how to gain love for a people who are from another world than you understand."
"joeravioli","9","6","20","4 March 2015"," A joyful, rewarding experience that will leave you smiling.
","Yes, I know. McFarland is a very, almost exclusively formulaic sports drama. It follows the routine that we have heard echoed in sports dramas long past, of a washed-up coach encouraging a bunch of raggedy kids to embrace their potential, through sweat and determination. But that doesn't mean McFarland is a bad movie. Quite the contrary, in fact. McFarland presents us with a positive outlook on life and humanity, giving us a much needed break from the dark, fantastical worlds of Kingsman and Fifty Shades. McFarland is bright, optimistic, and joyful. That, along with Niki Caro's loving direction and a score of smile-inducing performances makes for a rewarding film experience.<br/><br/>McFarland takes place in McFarland (of course), a small town in the United States where most of the residents (mostly Hispanic) pick and package crops, referring to themselves as ""pickers"". Jim White, a gym teacher fired from his position for injuring one of his players arrives in McFarland to work at the local high school, McFarland being the only place where he was able to find work. The residents of the town react with surprise at having a white man and his white family in their midst, but the racial gap quickly dissipates when they grow accustomed to them, and we discover that the residents are a close-knit, welcoming community full of charismatic kids, adults, and just the right amount of drunken parents to create sufficient conflict. Jim White sees the boys' potential as runners, and creates a cross-country team for them, enlisting seven boys, each of which has their own, distinct, lovable personality. They train and run often, occasionally coming into conflict with White, but as the community begins to accept him, they also begin to accept him.<br/><br/>White and his family, while being repulsed by the people of the town at first, are caught up in the love everyone has for one another, and consequently fall in love with the town as well. The story is punctuated with minor conflicts, although a few of these seem to exist only to kill time.<br/><br/>White begins to develop a fatherly affection for each one of the kids as they come to accept him. Each one is funny and joyful in a distinct way, except for the brooding character of Thomas Valles (he comes around eventually).<br/><br/>While the film presents itself as a sports drama, it is truly a tale of social unity and adapting ways of life. White must adapt to the way of life of the residents of McFarland, while they must adapt to his presence. Each party's readiness to do this left me smiling like a goofball. I highly recommend this movie. Skip out on Spongebob and watch this."

","I'm not going to criticize a film for being too sappy, to me that means the film makes me smile even when it's not funny. While the film is clichéd (like most sports films today), from the characters to the story it's very funny, and entertaining. The film is based on a true story so there's only so much room for originality, but it makes up for it's unoriginality in it's heart. Costner is good as the father/teacher/cross country coach, but the characters that steal the movie are the cross country runners in the movie. The film is funny, heartwarming, and filled with interesting characters. This is one of those films sports fans will love, so if that's your genre check this movie out."
"statuskuo","8","7","26","21 February 2015"," It's About America
","I loved this movie. It's simple and straight forward and you sense what is going to happen, but who cares. It's the journey these young kids go through. It is about what America was about. The hopes and wishes of their children doing better than them. And most of the time, it is something that isn't gigantic. The stakes are huge, but they are life changing.<br/><br/>Costner plays it really low key. He puts on the charm of previous films that have him hapless, yet hopeful. The whole point of this is that America gives you second chances. You can take opportunity and whine and cry, but you can also see the good in it. Think about terrible jobs you have in life. The simple solution is to do it half-ass and complain. Well, of course, you first fall under that spell, but the smart person sees potential and makes the best of a bad situation. In Costner's case, the choice was forced upon him. A defeated family man who wants to make the best for his wife and kids. He openly shows disappointment, which...truth be told, most men tend to suffer silently. His supportive wife (played by a subdued Maria Bello) skirts the very touchy subject of being a talented but saddled with near poverty. This was how it was in the 80's. She believes in him. Yes, corny for our post-2000 world, but it felt..real. Contrast to that, these young Mexican kids who have no other future but to be migrant pickers. You are told this is generational. And there is no getting beyond it. This is their reality. But for a brief moment, they found a small victory in life. That glimpse...everyone should experience at one point in their lives.<br/><br/>It is an inspiring movie, and oftentimes on the nose. Given in the hands of typical Disney grinder, this could've been eye-roller. But in Niki Caro's hands, it was effective. I like the movie, I liked the kids. And I liked the performances."
"Ramascreen","9","6","22","20 February 2015"," McFarland USA is awe-inspiring
","Don't quickly diss and dismiss this as just another sports movie, because it's not just another sports movie and to be frank, if it weren't for Disney, unbelievable true stories like this wouldn't have been told in such medium that can reach a lot of people. McFARLAND is awe-inspiring, it'll get you to stand on your feet and cheer for what it means to live in this great nation of ours.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is a reliable name, a dependable actor when it comes to movies that have sports as their set or background, but if you think about it, what makes Kevin Costner's many so-called sports movies in the past excellent was that they were always more than just about the sports and McFARLAND USA is another example of that. Under the direction of Niki Caro, who gave us ""Whale Rider"" and ""North Country"", Costner gives his best performance yet as coach Jim White who after an incident, finds himself having to move his family to the only job at the only school that would hire him, but they have to make things work in a town where the majority is hispanic Americans. Not being used to the neighborhood, Jim has his doubts and at first isn't inspired to do anything more than his day-to-day usual, but then he notices that the students in that McFarland high school have a unique potential, they may not be good at football or any other sports, but they could run. So Jim White forms a cross country team for them, but Jim's lack of knowledge or lack of understanding of the sport gets them to a very rough start. So Jim and his students have to learn as they go<br/><br/>But Jim has another obstacle, most of the students in his cross country team, have to work early in the morning to help their family, and that serves a big challenge if they plan on winning State Championship.<br/><br/>I think McFARLAND USA is a beautifully crafted film that aims to inspire and does its job well, its cinematic feel, its speeches, its structures, it has everything you'd expect in a sports movie that can motivate you to do great things in life, but it's also unique in that this is the first time, possibly as I could remember it, a sports movie that covers this ethnicity and I mean that in a good way, in our current state of our nation today where there has been racial tension going on, suspicions and violence over turfs and ethnicities, there couldn't be a better time for McFARLAND USA to arrive and educate our young minds about tolerance, about celebrating differences, about respecting everybody no matter what background they come from. This is a movie that's as well-made as it is also good-hearted.<br/><br/>When you think about America, you shouldn't think about Donald Trump or any other privileged folks who receive investments handed down to them. When you think about America, you should think of folks like the kids in this movie, McFARLAND USA, because in America, you can go from having to pick plants to becoming a state champion, in America, if you work hard, have a clear goal and set your mind to it, you can achieve anything.<br/><br/>-- Ramascreen.com --"

The emotions that rippled through my mind and body are still over-whelming me days later. First, GOOD JOB!! EVERYONE involved! I can't wait to see it again--next week. What stuck me personally was my emotion from the beginning. My eyes, from the start, were anticipating tears and welling up when the most subtle things were being portrayed. There seemed to be so much heart right from the beginning. That snot-nosed uppity kid that--OK, no spoilers--but I wonder what he thinks now! Or where he is. Assuming he really existed. In any true story, dialogue and stories necessitate some embellishment. But never for a moment did I consider that while being in the captivation of this movie. Thank you Kevin Costner for being involved in the development, because your personal standards have put the authenticity into this film. I actually knew an FFA boy from McFarland, back in 1954. He had the grand champion steer at the LA Great Western Livestock Show. OK, maybe not pertinent, but I got familiar with a lot of those small wonderful towns in the CV. OMGoodness! Great movie!

I will remember the scenes where Coach and the kids are working in the fields! There are scenes that are really moving, bringing a few tears, because the actors are mostly unknown and do a good job of conveying the emotional journey from hopeless to hopeful through their commitment to cross-country running competition. Kevin Costner as Coach does a good job showing his evolution from dictatorial, angry coach with privileged athletes in a middle class culture to inspirational ""father figure"" coach with immigrant Hispanic kids who have the endurance to help their families as ""pickers"" in agricultural community while attending school at same time. It's a pretty straight-line plot without much theatricalism, which is refreshing and makes it worth seeing.

Kevin Costner plays the same character he always plays recently, but he has still been good. The supporting cast also did a great job! Carlos Pratts was probably the best in the film. I love it when unknowns impress me.<br/><br/>-The characters were all pretty deep characters and had a lot to offer.

"goodnerdbadnerd","9","5","20","20 February 2015"," Expect to leave inspired
","It should surprise no one that McFarland USA is intended to be a heartwarming and inspirational drama. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and the same production team behind true-life sports narratives as Miracle, Invincible and Secretariat, the film is an invariable underdog story: underprivileged kids facing overwhelming odds and a down-on-his-luck coach form an unlikely friendship and ultimately achieve the impossible. Largely thanks to talented art and acting direction as well as an eminently likable star, McFarland expertly avoids overt sentimentality, never forcing you into feeling something unearned, nor relying upon evident feel good themes or the soundtrack to do the work. Instead what follows is an authentic, true-to-life telling of otherwise unremarkable and overlooked athletes transformed into championship contenders. <br/><br/>Director Niki Caro and well cast ensemble, anchored by Hollywood veteran Kevin Coaster, give us the story of Jim White, a washed up high school football coach, who begins the film at a career low point. After losing his job following a hot tempered outburst, White moves his family to a cracker-box house, in a dicey, poor neighborhood in California's San Joaquin Valley, where he's procured a last-chance teaching position at McFarland High School. After making a poor first impression, White soon takes notice of a group of Latino teenagers with a talent for running and stamina developed after years of grueling work, picking crops both before and after school to help support their families. With the principle's support, he decides to start a cross country team, built around the super-fast Thomas Valles, knowing nothing about long distance running or even track, but willing to put in the effort and somehow believing that his team has the potential to qualify for the first- ever state championship meet. <br/><br/>Beyond the main sports narrative, McFarland USA also offers a powerful immersion into the culture of these Mexican immigrants and the taxing lifestyle that is part and parcel of their work. For a film that could have easily been rendered a clichéd portrayal, Caro was careful to choose specific examples that poignantly depict the difficult and harsh reality of life in a migrant community. While not a stranger to tough times, in this world, Jim White is an outsider. Until, in an important scene, both for the character and the audience's understanding, he works the fields with his runners for a day, returning home exhausted and nearly crippled from the back breaking labor. <br/><br/>All things considered, McFarland owes much of its commercial appeal and likability to Costner's convincing portrayal as a flawed and arguably difficult guy with fundamentally moral instincts. Like few other actors, he is capable of embodying an ethical ideal through his forceful, yet understated performance and infuses the picture with an emblematic, all-American quality and believability. Admittedly, the role of Jim White bears obvious similarly to other sports figures he's portrayed over his career, but Costner's unpretentious interpretation yields a genuine, salt-of-the-earth character that lends the audience to believe that heroes can truly come from anywhere. <br/><br/>For the sports enthusiast and those in search of an uplifting true story, McFarland USA is a worthy film to see. Don't expect overwhelming cinematic brilliance, but to expect to leave inspired."

Not just by Kevin Costner, but by every cast member in the movie. Kevin Costner does do a terrific job as Jim White. This is his best performance in a while I can tell you that. He seemed to be very dedicated to his role throughout the film. Also the actors who made up the cross country team of McFarland were surprisingly all believable. I don't mean this in a bad way, I just expected their acting to be a little worse than it was. However, they truly make you believe their a team with true heart and care for each other throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The script is generally compelling, except for some clichés one would come to expect from a sports movie. However, I had no problem with these clichés, because they were done in a good way. For example, the ""speech a coach always gives to the team before a big game"" cliché, this was done in such a satisfying way that it made you forget that it even was a cliché.<br/><br/>The film overall was a truly inspirational piece of cinema. The themes portrayed throughout the film will really get you thinking about your life and the lives of others around you. Go see this film folks, even if your not a big fan of sports films, this will surly get you inspired."
"burlesonjesse5","7","4","19","26 March 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of McFarland, USA
","I've never been a huge fan of Disney sports movies. For every Invincible, there's a Herbie Fully Loaded. For every Remember the Titans, there's a Snow Buddies. It's all sugar coated, gerrymander stuff that doesn't quite deliver an emotional wallop. Enter McFarland, USA, the type of Disney inducement that sort of breaks the mold. Now granted, I wouldn't rank it as one of the best of its genre. It doesn't grab you by the lapels and make you get all teary-eyed like Hoosiers and Rudy (two of my all-time favorites). I will say however that next to last year's Million Dollar Arm, this 2015 release is probably the best sports flick to come out of Walt Disney Pictures, a production company that's been around before films even had the luxury of sound (we're talking over eighty years ago to be exact).<br/><br/>Directed by Niki Caro who oversaw the critically acclaimed Whale Rider (2002), McFarland, USA is based on a freshening true story that's long overdue. As you watch the events depicted via the year 1987, you wonder why it took so long for things to get greenlighted. Could it be the fear that a movie about cross country running might come across as boring or trivial? Maybe. Does it really matter at this point? Not so much. Critics have embraced it. Audiences seem to be eating it up. So to quote a song lyric from the late, great Jim Morrison, ""nothing left to do but run, run, run, let's run.""<br/><br/>Anyway, the story begins with real life football coach Jim White (played by Kevin Costner). The film's opening scene which is its weakest asset, shows him getting into a confrontation with his snobbish quarterback/captain. He argues with him, throws a cleat at his locker, said jock gets a cut on the face, and Jimbo gets fired from his job. Along with his wife Cheryl (Maria Bello in a side role that she could play in her sleep) and his two daughters, White moves from Boise, Idaho to one of the poorest towns in America being McFarland, California. He's there to take a second rate job (the only job he could get) as an assistant football coach. After yet again being asked to step down, he's handcuffed to just the role of a physical education teacher. It's within this realm that he learns about how fast his students can run. This gives Jim an idea: he's gonna convince the principal to back the first cross country team in the history of McFarland High. White will be the coach and all he has to do is find seven male runners. This sparks a plethora of comradery, friendship, father figure interludes, and determination between Costner's White and his underprivileged speed demons. As a team, they start to make waves at various running meets and eventually hightail it to the California state championships. ""McFarland's"" main conflict therefore, is the question of whether or not Jim is trying to boost his resume. He could get offered another job in a nicer town that's less poverty-stricken. He also could stay in McFarland seeing that him and his family become so attached to a community of hard working pickers with not so bright futures.<br/><br/>Now McFarland, USA is a conventional yet well filmed sports drama. With a little heart, a little tug, and a little shine courtesy of Australian cinematographer Adam Arkapaw, it gets the job done. The running scenes are profusely shot with the Southwest California landscape glistening in the background. Its authenticity is paramount showcasing unknown, young cast members (from what I read, actual students from McFarland High School as well) and the mighty Kevin Costner whose old world weariness, scruffy demeanor, and acting as veritable comfort food deem him perfect for the role of Jim White.<br/><br/>Yeah the outcome here might be a little predictable, the racial stereotyping of cultural differences (between Americans and Hispanics) overwhelms key scenes, ""McFarland"" is sometimes, forcefully mean spirited, and the opening sequence of Costner's White as volatile, coaching henchman seems totally undernourished (not to mention unconvincing). However, what's on screen is to a degree, admirable family fare (PG-style). And Costner being so synonymous with sports bids, can faithfully add this one to his greatest hits collection (alongside Field of Dreams, Draft Day, and Tin Cup).<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is feel good, fast food stuff that's not in any sense, preheated. McFarland, USA is a place to go to in your mind, a movie to see. Rating: 3 enduring stars.<br/><br/>Of note: I loved the final credits montage. It showcases the real life runners, their real life coach, and the current state of the actual McFarland High School. It also explains in worded titles, what they are up to in their lives (roughly twenty-eight years later). It's indeed heartwarming and very well done."
"CleveMan66","8","4","19","1 March 2015"," ""McFarland, USA"" builds on an already great year for Hispanics in cinema.
","2015 is shaping up to be a great year for Hispanics in the movies! First, the drama ""Spare Parts"" told the true story of undocumented Mexican-American high school students who entered a college-level competition to build the best underwater robot. Then, 2014's surprise Mexican hit ""Buen Dia, Ramon"" (a Mexican-German production also known as ""Guten Tag, Ramon"") brought its unusual feel-good story north of the border. Shortly after that, ""A la mala"", a 2015 Mexican romantic comedy opened in the U.S. All three of those movies have been reviewed and highly recommended by the Movie Fan community Facebook page and in my IMDb reviews. Enter ""McFarland, USA"" (PG, 2:09), a movie in the spirit of ""Spare Parts"", but with its own unique story to tell.<br/><br/>McFarland is a small, primarily Hispanic town in rural south-central California. It's one of the poorest towns in the state. It's a place that people do not choose to go and where they only stay if they have no other options. And that doesn't just apply to the Mexican-American agricultural workers who call McFarland home. Idaho high school football coach Jim White moves his wife Cheryl (Maria Bello) and young daughters Julie (Homeland's Morgan Saylor) and Jamie (Elsie Fisher) to McFarland when he loses his job after accidentally injuring a student in a minor fit of rage. Jim and his family are the only Whites in town and practically the only whites too. They're clearly uncomfortable in their new and unfamiliar surroundings, but Jim just sees McFarland as a weigh station on his journey to professional redemption.<br/><br/>Jim was hired as a science and physical education teacher and assistant football coach, but he soon takes on another challenge. When he notices how fast some of his students run – both in class – and to and from school (in between working in the fields), he decides he wants to start McFarland High School's first cross-country team. Jim has absolutely no experience with the sport, but he convinces the friendly, but no-nonsense principal (Valente Rodriguez) to back him. It also takes some convincing to get seven boys to take time away from what they see as their lot in life to join his team – and the boys' parents to allow them the time to attend practice. Jim is very convincing, but his powers of persuasion go beyond mere words. He shows he cares in a variety of ways and gains the respect of the boys and the support of their families and the townspeople. Soon, Coach White and his runners, Thomas (Carlos Pratts), Johnny (Hector Duran), Victor (Sergio Avelar), Jose (Johnny Ortiz) and the three Diaz brothers, David (Rafael Martinez), Damacio (Michael Aguero) and the overweight, but underestimated Danny (Ramiro Rodriguez), are jelling as a team and seem poised for accomplishments they had never dreamed of, including maybe even leaving McFarland behind. Maybe.<br/><br/>""McFarland, USA"" is as formulaic as most sports movies (and the previously mentioned ""Spare Parts""), but a good movie is a good movie. This one is well-cast and well-acted, especially by Costner who definitely knows from sports movies (see 1988's ""Bull Durham"", 1989's ""Field of Dreams"", 1996's ""Tin Cup"" and 2014's ""Draft Day""). The story unfolds a bit sluggishly, but builds to some moments of tense drama, genuine emotion and life lessons and empathy that the audience is sure to carry home with them. There are some very enjoyable light-hearted moments too. Lastly, the films ends, as all ""Based on a True Story"" films do, with an obligatory, but especially poignant ""where are they now"" segment. Whether you see ""Spare Parts"", or ""McFarland, USA"", you're in for a treat. ""A-"""

","McFarland, USA, is Disney, USA, with a PG rating, nary a bad word, and very happy people, especially the Mexican families. Also, everyone is good looking and caring. But, you know, I like a true, uncomplicated, old- fashioned, small town story about a little team that can.<br/><br/>In this case McFarland, CA, a densely- Mexican populated southern Cal town, gets a new coach, Jim White (Kevin Costner), who has lost his job for losing his temper (the locker room scene makes it clear he was not totally wrong in his anger). Moving his family to this poor town is not the least of his challenges: His family dislikes the move, and he needs to learn about a culture different from his white-bread background.<br/><br/>As the newbies assimilate into this unusually happy and ultra-clean town (it is Disney after all), Jim White (now called ""Blanco"") discovers their hidden athletic talent while he learns more about their open culture. They march to the State Cross-Country finals through old-fashioned hard work and an encouraging speech now and then from the coach.<br/><br/>Along the way, director Niki Caro and Christopher Cleveland and his writing crew show the hard work Mexican kids do by getting up to work the fields, go to school, and end the day with more work in the fields. To Disney's credit, this challenge seems real, a sign of families working together for a better life. Still clean and happy."
"RforFilm","7","4","19","23 February 2015"," McFarland, USA benefits more from the environment and cinematography of the run rather then the characters
","If there was anything I hated more then P.E. class, it was running the track. Nowadays I probably wouldn't complain as much, but being a fifteen year old was something else. I was overweight in my youth and that made me out to be a slow kid on the track. Each morning (or afternoon in my senior year), after we change into our gear, our teacher would have us finish four laps, gaining a full mile under our feet. We weren't required to run those laps, but still, nobody wanted to walk it as they would never hear the end of the ridiculing. I did my best to jog them, but nothing would have persuaded me to do a marathon. <br/><br/>My biggest question when running the track was simply, ""how can those guys manage to run five miles and barley crack a sweat?"" Even when I pass a group while driving, I still can't understand their strength. Perhaps it's not just the training. It has to be the psychological core as well that needed to be develop. The kind of kids that participate in cross country training also tend to exceed well in academics and go on to Ivy league schools. For a lot of schools, this is probably the case, but for the team in McFarland, USA, it's a different situation. <br/><br/>In 1987, high school football coach Jim White (played by Kevin Costner) has anger issues that cause him to job hop many times. An incident with a player getting his head cut causes the most damage to his career, leaving him with little options. He settles for a life science/coaching job in the Latino town of McFarland, CA. Most of the residents either own farms or work on those farms, with many of the high school kids working as fruit pickers in the morning and day. <br/><br/>White, his wife Cheryl (played by Maria Bello) and two daughters have a hard time fitting into the intimidating community while Jim tries, but can't seem to help the schools really bad football team. While coaching P.E., he notices that the boys are very fast runners, with a young man Thomas Valles clocking in at twelve miles an hour. White decides that the boys are right for cross-country running, despite that the school doesn't have a team. The principal approves and White learns more about the sport while teaching these kids about good ethics and how they can achieve in anythingyour typical sports stuff. <br/><br/>On paper, McFarland, USA sounds like every other sports story and it does follow the formula pretty safely. You've got your bad boys that are likely going to learn their lessons, the coach that will change himself and the kids, and the town is going to laugh at the crazy idea until it works. This movie has all of that, yet I still recommend this.<br/><br/>What won me over firsthand is the sport being shown, cross-country running. It's repetitive to watch, but the film plays it's California environment to its advantage and the running actually looks good with the hills and farms that each competition is running around.<br/><br/>McFarland, the small town in question, reveals to have a lot of personality. We learn very early on that the folk here are resilient, but can come together to show homeliness. The cinematography has fallen in love for this place as the movie looks beautiful. The kids aren't as well developed, and the film could have been more moving had it been from their perspective, but Costner does well in his spot as coach Jim White. <br/><br/>I'll give this seven running shoes out of ten. There's little new here in terms of sport movies, but McFarland, USA has a lot of charm and gumption to prove otherwise. It's not for those that are tired of the sports movie cliché, but the rest might be surprised."
"bbickley13-921-58664","8","4","21","21 February 2015"," Disney has perfected the sports movie about underdog doing good.
","Kevin Costner is real good at playing the flawed mentor. He's not perfect and the goal is together we will make it and you will fix me as much as I'll fix you, and it works for Costner in this film, just like it worked in Black or White, which is in theaters at the same time as this one. <br/><br/>Although I like the other, Mexicans do good movie, Spare Parts with George Lopez better,that was not really a sports movie they were competing in a science competition. This is a sports movie and a damn good one. <br/><br/>Nothing like seeing the under dogs succeed. It's very formulated, but the formula is working well as Kevin Costner as Jim White, A Football coach who's too tough on his students, which cost him to loose his job and have to move his family to a poor town called McFarland were he teaches a group of kids who don't think they'll amount to anything, that they can amount to everything by coaching them on a cross country track team.<br/><br/>It's funny how much this story resembles Spare Parts, both based on a true story and both true stories match well with a cross country track team replacing an Engineering club. And it's like every single sports movie formula, but I must admit, I knew nothing about Cross Country track so that made it original. <br/><br/>Also, it was a story about community, which was original. These kids were from the poor side of the tracks not the wrong side of the tracks, which puts a spin on that stereotypical kid who comes from a family of gang bangers, stereotype. It was interesting to see how tight this small town was and how they embraced the White family.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a formula that works well. You've seen it a million times before but Kevin Costner and the other cast members gave a heartfelt performance that makes it worth seeing."
"LogicIsEverything","Null","3","17","18 May 2015"," better than ""spare parts"" but
","The screenplay is quite boring that made Kevin Costner become even more boring. In ""still Alice"" we got a disconnected and feeling-less husband played poorly by Alec Baldwin, here we got a cardboard-like 1-dimensional, wrinkle-faced actor, playing a poor role as a husband, father, and a teacher/coach. The whole screenplay is also a 1-directionally scripted one with a lifeless directing, but it was luckily saved by a bunch of Mexican actors and a quite inspiring true story. The dialog, storyline, scenario and all the related components are actually very poor too. <br/><br/>All the going is well predictable, but the most letdown of this film is the distant and disconnecting performance of Kevin Costner, lacking passion and chemistry to all the other characters in this film, using his mouth doing lip services to all of the other characters. One of the other poor performances is the young men's lacking of the trademark Mexican English (Spanglish) accent. Young men who grow up in a isolated small farmland city where 99.9% of the residents/parents/men/women are Mexican originated, how could it possible most of the young people speaking non-accent pure American English, especially that young actor who played as one of the leading characters? I always consider if actors who failed to play roles that needed to change accents in order to match with the background locality are NOT good enough actors. There were so many American actors who played roles in different movies that we saw had changed their accents into specified local dialects, yet all the young Mexican background actors failed miserably by speaking non-accent pure American English and some of them simply looked too old to be high school students. By merely running fast you could got scholarships and attended colleges, even a county college, is nothing but unfair to those who really studied hard but still poor."
"ThomasDrufke","7","1","3","20 September 2015"," Fast Times at McFarland High
","A job of a film based on a true story is not to tell everything exactly how it is, in fact, much of McFarland USA is fibbed to a certain extent. But to me, that's perfectly fine. McFarland, USA is a very entertaining movie even with its historical inaccuracies. Disney consistently puts out these under the radar sports films. Plus, you can't really go wrong with Kevin Costner starring in a sports film anyway.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a underdog Latino cross country team from McFarland, California coached by a white male coincidentally named James White. You get pretty much every cliché in the books in terms of sports films. The family issues of too much commitment to the sport, trust issues with their coach, and the dramatic left turn in the 3rd act. But clichéd films can still be good if handled correctly, and McFarland, USA most definitely was. I was surprised by the acting from pretty much unknown actors across the board, aside from Costner and Maria Bello. There's also a good amount of culture blending between White's family and the Latino families that predominately populated the city. Although most of the family issues that were going on seemed more like plot devices than anything else, I enjoyed watching the families come together for a Quinceañera and to cheer on their McFarland team.<br/><br/>The film tries and tackle a different issue with each of the teams members and while most of them work dramatically on their own, it didn't seem like it tonally fit in with the rest of the picture. But I can't peak highly enough on how much I dug Costner's speeches throughout the film. I've seen many sports films with a ton of great speeches, but these hang up there with the great ones.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how much of the behind the scenes issues with the coach being recruited were factual, but I can say that I don't think they were really necessary. I think the ending has enough gravitas to hold its own without having that hang over the fate of the team. I'm also not too sure on why the subtle romance was necessary as it felt really awkward throughout. The movie has an emotionally satisfying ending that I think I can forgive some of its mistakes.<br/><br/>+Costner's performance & speeches<br/><br/>+Family aspect<br/><br/>+Emotionally satisfying<br/><br/>+Music<br/><br/>-Awkward romance<br/><br/>-Few far-fetched moments and clichés<br/><br/>7.1/10"

Where's the struggle and inspiration? Aside from the captions that showed the years of the events there was little to connect it to the 1980's.

","This is based upon a true story. <br/><br/>Jim White (Kevin Costner) gets a teaching job in McFarland, California after having his troubles at other schools. At his last job, he got fired for throwing a football shoe at the captain of the football team and blood was drawn. He goes to McFarland, CA where he institutes a Cross County program in 1987. He did this after having some difficulty with the McFarland Head Football Coach. <br/><br/>The movie makes it like you see above, but in reality Disney doesn't tell us that Jim White was teaching at McFarland for about 10-years before doing the Cross Country program. Also, in reality Jim White had 3-daughters, not two as seen in the movie and some of them had already graduated college by 1987. Everything else seems to be okay though. Well, almost as McFarland was mostly white not Latino, but Disney (again) makes McFarland mostly Latino. Oh, one more thing, the eldest daughter, Julie, didn't have a thing with Thomas (Carlos Pratts) one of the runners. Yes, Disney again.<br/><br/>Okay all that aside this is a good, really good feel- good movie. Jim White did do the Cross Country program and did very well. We see the problem he has with his runners who also worked the fields with their parents and worked out a schedule so that they could practice running and still help the parents. Jim White even goes picking one day to really appreciate what his runners go through on a daily basis and admits later on that was one of the worst days in his life. <br/><br/>We see tension at times when the family first moves to McFarland and also during the meets. <br/><br/>What makes this a good movie are the pep talks Jim White gives to his runners to make them understand what is really happening and how they can succeed going against other all-white schools whose runners have all the social and educational advantages they do not have.<br/><br/>One good line happens when Thomas asks a runner from an all-white school – just before a race - ""Do you play golf?"" and the runner says he does. Thomas then says, ""This isn't golf.""<br/><br/>Costner shines as do his runners who tow the mark and are very respectful. It takes some time before they call him ""Coach"" instead of ""white"" and not a reference to his name. See? Maria Bello is good as Cheryl, Jim's wife. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie we see the real Jim White and those runners (now adults) and what happened to them and we also see how McFarland did in the Cross Country Program for a number of years since 1987. <br/><br/>(7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Not really.

McFARLAND USA documents that as far back as the 1900s there were parts of America which spoke Mexican, ate Mexican, drank Mexican, worked Mexican, played Mexican, drove Mexican, partied Mexican, fought Mexican, ran Mexican, and were flagged Mexican. Since then this situation has been greatly magnified, so viewers of McFARLAND USA won't be able to avoid realizing the obvious solution.

Race is a common theme of the film much like other Disney sports films like Million Dollar Arm and Remember the Titans. Disney tends to follow a similar format for their sports movies and McFarland USA is no exception but Costner is so lovable in the league and it is hard not to become a sucker for that underdog story.

","You can't swing a cat without hitting a ""based on real life"" sports story usually about inner city youth or a struggling neighbourhood. They are uplifting films and I have enjoyed many of them. Disney has done some of the best ones out there and McFarland, USA fits that bill. Kevin Costner is one of my all time favourites and the reason why I saw this film. He doesn't disappoint and neither does the movie. You can't be disappointed in the film with low expectations because you have to know what to expect. The film is clean enough for most families although our theatre had it listed as ""G"" Rated and I don't stand behind that at all. There was some minor cursing and the tone of the film is just a tad much to be G. It is still an inspiring story with great characters and while it does nothing to make itself stand apart from other films, it was well worth watching.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner should be known as the sports actor by now. Three baseball films, golf, football and now this. I would hardly say this is his best performance but its still a solid go. He brings a lot of heart to the role and complexity to a simplistic part. The heart and soul of this film are really the boys that he coaches to success in track. Ramiro Rodriguez, Carlos Pratts, Johnny Ortiz, Rafael Martinez, Hector Duran, Sergio Avelar and Michael Aguero are all very good and have terrific chemistry together. They are believable and show a ton of emotion and really make this story come to life. Together with Costner, it is the perfect blend of personalities to make this effective. Maria Bello is okay but completely underused and underdeveloped as Costner's wife. Morgan Saylor is terrific as Costner's teenage daughter. She shows a lot of talent in her role and I think she is one to watch as she is also very good in Homeland too.<br/><br/>Director Niki Caro gives a lot of heart to this film. You can see it and you can feel it. I think the only issue with this film is that we have seen it all before but don't let that steer you away from seeing it. If you enjoy this type of true life story or you want a good decent family film (with a little bit of bad language) then this is one you will certainly not regret seeing. Disney knows how to make these films and they will continue to be successful at it. This was as good as last year's Million Dollar Arm, maybe make these two a double feature. 8/10"

The writers deliver us the perfect liberal dupe who feels so guilty he goes out into the fields with them to find out how terrible it is to suffer under their working conditions. But where I truly felt nauseous was the deafening silence as to why they came to America in the first place, and what benefits they received for free and what opportunity the free education and healthcare will mean to them. Never once in this entire film is there anything that would represent an honest opinion by even one migrant. They all came because they hate the USA but it was still better than where they came from. Just not enough to offset the horrible conditions here or give them pause to praise their good fortune. I found it utterly disgusting that no reviews I read were aware of this deafening silence. As I was raised in a neighborhood full of Mexican migrants, I can attest that there was not a single one ungrateful for this country and really trying hard to be a part of it. In this film, the liberal, guilty white coach assimilates into THEIR culture and never even mentions USA pride. The truth is, most of South and Central America and Mexico, like Cuba were completely taken over by socialists and communists LONG AGO, and have remained in poverty, with rampant crime and corruption for many decades. That is why so many want to get away and move here. The countries they live in have schools that ONLY teach socialism, guilty socialism, so everyone remains poor except for the elites, who live like kings and queens. That is except where the collapse of the country has occurred like in Venezuela. Want to know why Chile is so modern and thriving with infrastructure and wealth? Because they are one of the few that fought communism and would not let it take over. It is just a shame no one questions this illiterate Hollywood tripe or knows what they are being fed under the guise of good, wholesome entertainment. HA."

","There is a scene in McFARLAND, USA in which a pickup is seen driving through town with two flags perched upon it; one is American, the other is Mexican. That's what this film is all about. Like GRAN TORINO, the film is about a traditional white man with traditional beliefs who learns to explore the Mexican culture and appreciate, much like Clint Eastwood did with the Hmong culture. Kevin Costner plays the white man, Tim White (I know, but that was actually the man's name) in the true story of how he bonded with young, Mexican teenagers to create a competitive and successful high school cross country running team in one of the poorest towns in America. Costner continues the fine work he did in DRAFT DAY, and he may be even better in this one. One of the team members, named Danny, is overweight and is always the last member to finish the race. Costner encourages the young man by telling him that he is the anchor of the team and that they can't compete without him. These are the types of films that could serve as the anchor for Costner's career, bringing him into the finish line near the front instead of lagging behind. I could skip THREE DAYS TO KILL, but there is nearly no way I would skip a Costner film like DRAFT DAY or McFARLAND. And by the way, McFARLAND is the better of the two films. The movie is full of the usual Disney sport film clichés, but for everything the film does that isn't on point, it does even more right. The film is inspiring, touching, and very enjoyable from the get-go. Disney took a step backwards with MILLION DOLLAR ARM, but this one makes me reminisce of fun sports films like INVINCIBLE and GLORY ROAD that Disney has championed in the past. Films like McFARLAND really make us, the audience, feel something. That's what films are supposed to be all about. McFARLAND, USA is far from perfect, or even greatness, but it is still a very good film that satisfied my ""Saturday night at the movies"" craving."

","""So, do you guys get paid by the hour? -No, the field.""<br/><br/>McFarland, USA is the perfect opportunity to get to see Kevin Costner doing what he does best, which is inspirational sport movies. Once again he delivers a charismatic performance, this time as the coach of a cross country team from a poor school in McFarland, California. Costner has never been better than when he is playing a role in a sport movie (with the exception of the cold blooded murderer Mr. Brooks). He elevates a film that would otherwise be deemed as formulaic and predictable by bringing a lot of heart to the film and thus making it stand out from other inspirational Disney films. This is the classic fish out of water tale where a Caucasian coach is introduced to a struggling latino community. You could very easily predict what is going to happen, but somehow the film manages to make an emotional connection with the audience through carefully developed characters. The film isn't interested in simply pointing out the accomplishments of these cross country runners, but rather focusing on who they are and how they relate with each other and their families. There are also some funny racial gags that can be expected as well. This is a feel good movie that is expertly directed by Niki Caro who has delivered some solid films in the past (Whale Rider and North Country). Caro is one of the many uprising female directors with a strong voice in Hollywood and someone who I will be looking forward to in the future. <br/><br/>The film takes place in 1987 in a small California town with a predominantly latino community. Kevin Costner plays Jim White, a teacher who applies for a job at one of the schools here after having moved around from different schools for several incidents throughout his career. He is overqualified for the job, but White is running out of options. He moves to McFarland with his wife Cheryl (Maria Bello) and his two young daughters, Julie (Morgan Saylor) and Jamie (Elsie Fisher). At first they aren't thrilled to be here feeling out of place, but soon the community welcomes them. Principal Camillo (Valente Rodriguez) allows Mr. White to start a cross country program in the school after he realizes that most of the kids are good runners. They basically get up at dawn to work in the crop fields and then run to the school and back again after they're done. Despite not knowing anything about running, Mr. White (who his students call Blanco) uses his coaching abilities to get the best out of the natural born runners. The team consists of three brothers (Danny, David, and Damacio) who come from a very family oriented home. There is also Thomas (Carlos Pratts) whose father has just been released out of prison and seems to have some issues at home. He is the most talented runner, but he feels like he should be spending his time at work helping his family instead of in practice. Cross country becomes a means for these kids to grow and stay out of trouble. The film focuses on their relationship with White and the rest of their families. <br/><br/>McFarland starts off a bit slow, but once we are introduced to the runners the story picks up and becomes emotionally engaging. The kids have great chemistry with Kevin Costner and the tension comes mainly from getting permission by their families to practice rather than on external things. These kids come from low income families and have to work during early and late hours of the day at the crop fields before and after school. They have a hard lifestyle and once you see the film you won't complain about your childhood. This inspirational sports movie is formulaic, but when the formula works as well as it does there is no need to change it. I was pleasantly surprised by this inspiring film and it is a shame it wasn't seen by more people. Structurally it is very similar to Disney's Million Dollar Arm, but McFarland has a lot more heart and the characters are more engaging. Kevin Costner's charisma elevates the film, but the kids also deliver strong roles, especially Carlos Pratts who has several strong scenes here. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Here's a feel good sports movie that goes a bit deeper. It's the story of a coach that hits bottom and takes kids from the poorest part of society to new heights.<br/><br/>It the classic formula of the coach learning as much from his students as they learn from him. Based on a true story, the ""where they are now"" shots makes for a feel good Hollywood ending.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner carries this movie on his back. It's hard to believe the movie gets made without him. The supporting performances are serviceable even though the lead student and top runner looks way too old for high school.<br/><br/>The movie plays well on the big screen but it won't loose too much on a home platform. The movie is suitable for and will be enjoyed by all ages."

","It's not easy to make this real life stories feel ... real. So while this moves along smoothly and makes it seem easy, it's not as easy to pull it off most of the time. Kevin Costner is no stranger to sports dramas of course and he makes a strong lead. But it's not only him who makes the movie work, it's the other actors too.<br/><br/>You'd also have to have a heart of stone not to be touched by some of the very genuine moments in this. At the end, we also see the real people and what happened to them. It's predictable most of the time, but that doesn't take away anything from it or the impact it has on the viewer (those who let themselves dive in)."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","28 June 2015"," Inspiring true story of a coach who gets Mexican immigrant sons to run cross country.
","This is definitely not a ""republican"" movie, where the focus is more often ""how can we keep Mexicans out of the USA?"" This is about Mexican immigrant families working hard in the fields of California, harvesting the current crop, be it tomatoes or oranges or cabbage. They get paid by the field so long hours and picking efficiency has its reward. It is a job for all male family members with little time for fun.<br/><br/>But Kevin Costner as Jim White has just been fired from a coaching job because he became angry at a player's attitude and threw a shoe at him, cutting the boy's face, in the locker room at halftime. So as a last resort, to support his family of wife and two daughters, he lands in Mcfarland, California, a heavily Mexican community in the center of the state north of Los Angeles, in 1987. He assists with football, but the team is poor. However he notices that many of the boys seemingly can run forever. As one explains, he doesn't have a car so he needs to get places.<br/><br/>Somewhere in all this coach White gets permission to start a cross country team. No one at the school even knew what all cross country entailed. None of the boys went into it eagerly. But gradually they managed to form a team with the mandatory 7 boys.<br/><br/>Costner is really good and the script is very interesting. The DVD has an extra which includes shots of the original boys, now in their 40s, running with the boys in the cast. Apparently former cross country members routinely return to visit and run with the boys in training just for the team-building factor. It is a matter of record that Mcfarland won 9 state cross country championships over a 14- year period starting in 1987.<br/><br/>Good movie, shows how one person can make a lasting difference through perseverance, even if coach White's initial ambition was just to find a job away from Mcfarland. His attitude changed and he remained there."
