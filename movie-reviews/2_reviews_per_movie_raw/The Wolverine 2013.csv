"chunkmeal2","3","480","688","27 July 2013"," WORST X-men movie ever (by far).
","Usually plot holes are isolated. This movie was however one giant plothole. <br/><br/>(1) Grandpa<br/><br/>This is what I understood at the end of the movie: Turns out Grandpa is a bad ass who just wanted to magically suck Wolverine's healing powers and live forever. So what he did was (i) Invite Wolverine to Japan; (ii) Fake his own death; (iii) As part of his plan (?) inject a spider onto Wolverine's heart so that he loses his healing powers--What in the world did this achieve for evil Grandpa?; (iv) As part of his plan (?) allow his granddaughter to be subject to multiple assassination attempts, just so that Wolverine will keep following her; (v) Then after leaving a trail of crumbs for Hansel and Gretel, captures his granddaughter, and lures Wolverine to some sort of lair, where his powers can be sucked.<br/><br/>The (?)'s indicate where I am not sure if it was really part of Grandpa's plan or things just worked out this way. <br/><br/>Given the tremendous amount of uncertainty involved in the above plan (e.g. Wolverine might've been killed, in which case no powers to suck; his granddaughter might've been killed, in which case end of story, and Wolverine would've returned to the Yukon to chill out with grizzlies), you'd think there'd been a simpler and cleaner way to do all this. But no. <br/><br/>All this is quite forgivable, compared to other things that went wrong. <br/><br/>(2) Viperwoman<br/><br/>What the hell is motivating her? What does she want? Is she working for herself? Or is she working for Grandpa and if so, why? <br/><br/>How did she inject the spider onto Wolverine's heart? Just by kissing him in the middle of the night? (This was never clarified.)<br/><br/>(3) Japanese Father and Japanese Fiancé<br/><br/>OK so it turns out the whole family (except pretty granddaughter) are a bunch of one-dimensional assholes. This is clichéd and boring and stupid, but still acceptable if you at least make some effort explaining what exactly was motivating them. <br/><br/>Japanese Father wants to kill his own daughter just because Grandpa willed her everything? (Oh, and this too was part of Grandpa's grand masterplan?)<br/><br/>Japanese Fiancé is just some asshole who's engaged to pretty granddaughter (this, BTW, is explained for us gaijin simply by the line that ""You're not Japanese, so you won't understand""). He's the minister of justice or something. And he likes to have white hookers in his hotel room. Uh, and what else do we know about him? Nothing! Basically he's just some asshole who somehow wants to do bad things. <br/><br/>There are many other things wrong with this movie. E.g.,<br/><br/>(4) Totally artificial and forced chemistry between Wolverine and pretty Japanese granddaughter.<br/><br/>I literally cringed whenever they hooked up. <br/><br/>(5) Jean Gray bad dreams BS was just LAME<br/><br/>I can think of only two things I liked about the movie: (A) The Nagasaki A-bomb scene. Pretty sick, think it's the first time I've seen it portrayed up-close in any movie. (B) The black ninjas, doing their thing in the middle of the night and flying across roof-tops.<br/><br/>Other than that this movie was total scheisse."

"ThePterodactylGynecologi","5","217","315","27 July 2013"," Typical action mixed with a cheesy and illogical script
","The Wolverine is OK at best, even with Hugh Jackman's usual superb acting. Most of the action is mediocre and offers no surprises (you can tell from the situation who is gonna die and who is gonna hit who several seconds before they do so) with the exception of a few really great scenes, but these scenes are scattered very far apart. <br/><br/>What really brings the movie down isn't its action though, but rather the culprit lies in the writing. Not only does it defy science and physics every chance it gets -{{SPOILER: A poor representation of an atomic bomb hitting Nagasaki is shown through a memory SPOILER OVER}}- , but the depictions of certain powers make you wonder if the writers even know how Wolverine's powers work. -{{SPOILER: At one point a guy in a robot samurai (Real Steel, anyone?)somehow manages to CUT Wolverine's adamantium claws with a heated blade, despite the fact that adamantium is supposed to be unbreakable, with the only material within the same zone of strength being vibranium (what Captain America's shield is made of). But the film never offers any sort of clarification or explanation to this. Added to this is that by somehow drilling into his bones, the man in the suit gets younger as if he got Logan's healing factor (even though that's not how it works), yet a few seconds later he gets stabbed and his supposed healing power does nothing anymore? SPOILER OVER}}- <br/><br/>The character writing is poor and very 2-dimensional for everyone other than Logan, and so many developmental/emotional moments are thrown at you so fast that you don't have time to grab onto any of them. It's like there was a bag full of typical Hollywood ideas that the movie just flung on-top of the script.<br/><br/>Build onto this is a predictable and lazy script with a few cheap jokes and a forced romance, and you have a movie that does little more than half-entertain you. And to add to this, the after credits scene makes NO sense (powers wise) and backtracks/negates important aspects from the last movie, which is a very childish and unprofessional thing to do, even if the last movie was quite bad. The people at Marvel need to simply accept their mistake and move on, rather than try to dwell on things that people enjoyed from their first 2 successful X-Men movies.<br/><br/>However, people always overate movies when they first come out, especially for Marvel, so the rating you see here is probably not the one you would give it. But if you're willing to deny several of the things you thought you knew for an hour and a half to be sorta entertained, then you shouldn't have much of a problem for this movie. If not, i recommend reading the plot instead to get ready for the next movie."
"utgard14","6","41","55","26 June 2014"," What Might Have Been
","This is basically a tale of two movies. I know Hugh Jackman wanted this movie to be an adaptation of the classic Chris Claremont/Frank Miller comic book mini-series. You can see bits of that story here. But then you have this other stuff, far removed from that story, that seems to be studio-imposed and ultimately hurts what could have been one of the best comic book movies to date. The good stuff, the stuff worth watching this for, are the slower, quieter parts of the story. The Wolverine and Mariko parts, basically. But all of the special effects-heavy parts and the loud, flashy action sequences suck and take away from the impact the movie would have otherwise had. There's probably no better example than the different climactic battle scenes. Wolverine vs Shingen is a much more powerful, emotional scene than the shallow, garish stuff with Viper and a guy in robot armor.<br/><br/>I don't really blame James Mangold. No doubt it was Fox's interference that caused the problems and also caused Darren Aronofsky to bail before filming. You can see a better movie underneath this one. But Fox didn't have the guts to make that movie. Probably felt it wasn't commercial enough. Needed more robots and CGI fights on top of a speeding train. Still, it's good enough to watch and enjoy most of it. It's certainly miles better than the last Wolverine movie. But I can't help but feel sad thinking about what might have been. They very well could have given Wolverine his own 'Batman Begins' but instead we get just another watchable popcorn movie with hints at something more substantial."

","1. When Logan recovers from the atomic bomb blast, why does his hair grow back perfectly styled?<br/><br/>2. When he loses his healing ability and he extends his claws on the train, then retracts them, why do his knuckles instantly heal?<br/><br/>3. After Logan is shot several times in the chest, wouldn't the last thing he would want to do is go chop apart a huge fallen tree? Wouldn't his wounds open up and cause him to bleed to death?<br/><br/>4. It is very convenient that is Prometheus there was an alien removal machine and in Wolverine there was a color x-ray machine, but how could Logan operate on himself and reach to his heart to get the parasite? Beyond the fact that it would be awkward, beyond the fact that heart surgeons have to crack apart the ribs and then use a rib spreader, beyond the fact that his ribcage is saturated with adamantine, wouldn't the pain have caused him to black out?<br/><br/>5. If all Shingen had to do to get Logan's healing ability, wouldn't it have been easier for him to have drilled into his claws when he had him trapped in the chair, rather than building an adamantine transformer?<br/><br/>6. If Professor X found the ability to reintegrate his molecules like Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen, why didn't he fix his spine so that he didn't have to use the wheelchair anymore? And grow some hair on his head? (eh, you even gotta wonder why in the 24th Century, Jon Luc Picard never heard about Rogaine)<br/><br/>7. If only part of Logan's adamantine claws were chopped off, why do complete bone ones grow back? What happened to the partial metal ones?<br/><br/>The movie was far too long on ninja fight scenes. I was beginning to fall asleep. Sad that the bad guy turned out to be someone whose life he saved. The Viper character was just creepy without any definable reason for why he was even there.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a waste of bad popcorn."
"sam_smithreview","8","25","34","6 May 2016"," biased review of Wolverine fan
","I've been a fair fan of the series of the whole. Even the weaker installments I thoroughly enjoyed, so my review is already weighed in favor of this film. I will say even from a critics point of view I thought it was really well done. It's not the standard comic book fairy tale, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than previous installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found interesting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who provided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests. I found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after all the time we've get to see him in all his cinematic installments."

","I've wanted to see a wolverine movie that was fast paced, action packed, with a good storyline that would be well received by critics for the longest time. In my opinion wolverine is by far the most interesting of the x men characters. However this was not the wolverine I was waiting for. Yes it was action packed and I honestly enjoyed the fight scenes, but it was just shocking. This movie was flaw central. It saddens me to know that this was truly Hugh Jackmans last attempt at Wolverine, because we all know he's just too old for another attempt. And no one wants to see him as wolverine fighting off the bad guys at 45, it would be unbecoming. The characters in this story were ridiculous. I could tell from the moment they met that Wolverine was going to get with Mariko, but part of me just would not accept it, up until that fatal night when they kissed. A kiss which lacked any conviction or real passion, it was laughable. The oddest on screen couple I've seen since Matt Damon and Michael Douglas in Behind The Candelabra. They were painfully awkward. The arch villain serpant lady was atrocious. The ostentatious villain that we never even learn why or how she came about to work for Yashida with undiminishing loyalty, or what her general goal was. Yashida himself was a tedious villain and we didn't really here much about his life after Nagasaki. Mariko's father was a perpetual imbecile I could not fathom why he was even mentioned in the movie his character had no real significance. My favourite character had to have been Yuriko at least her motives were clear, Mariko was sort of a sister to her and it was obvious from the outset she wanted a slice of the wolverine pie. Now that couple would have at least been believable because she was bad ass and fearless. Her psychic powers were a bit ridiculous though she didn't really foresee anything worthwhile did she. The fight scenes were enjoyable though especially with the deadly ninja assassins creeping through the night, descending from rooftops and snapping necks like nobody's business. Yuriko was pretty sharp too, I was never really worried for her character, she could hold her own.... she had enough sass. It's a tragedy though I truly believe that Hugh Jackman was the perfect wolverine he just didn't get the movie he deserved. Well my advice is to wait a few years until the stench from this movie clears and then find a 20 year old Hugh Jackman doppelganger and create a Wolverine with some substance. It can't be that hard it has so much potential."

Completely unbelievable, unrealistic, CGI overload, cheesy, and a horrible plot that absolutely insult's the intelligence of it's audience.

"abhi_xecutor","3","79","128","9 August 2013"," Disappointing for a wolverine movie
","I can'y start to explain how much disappointed I was after watching this movie. As many of the x-men fans I too like the Wolverine the most. Having said that and given how much exciting the trailer looked for this title, the movie to me was a big let down. Its slow moving, not as much action packed as I hoped it would be. And plot to me made no sense. {Spoiler Alert} I don't know if I got it wrong but in the movie it has been portrayed that removing adamantium from Wolverine's body deprives him of his healing power. WTF ? More so it has been depicted to give the grandpa his(wolverine's) healing powers ! utter bullshit. Wolverine(Logan) was known for his healing power and that was the reason striker chose him for injecting adamantium. Did i miss something there ? There wasn't a single scene in the movie that I wished I could watch again, which is generally not true for a Wolverine movie. Can't believe how Jackman agreed to do this movie."
"Vartiainen","Null","29","45","14 February 2014"," Worthy successor
","I didn't much care for X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Hugh Jackman still was, and always will be, a brilliant Wolverine, but the other characters felt lackluster, the villain was weak and the storyline didn't fit well with the other X-Men movies. It didn't have the same feel.<br/><br/>For some time it seemed that the poor critical performances of both that and X-Men 3 would mean there would be no more movies with Wolverine in them, at least in a leading role. Luckily, the film makers decided to do one more and if this particular movie is going to be the last one, I for one can move on happy with what I got.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is a movie that works both as a continuation of the X-Men storyline, as well as a standalone movie. The focus is kept heavily on Hugh Jackman, which works for the movie's advantage. There are some callbacks to the events of the trilogy, but as a whole I think this film could have worked just as well without them, if not better, as they are a bit distracting from time to time. But most of the time the focus is on where it should be. In this movie Logan travels to Japan in order to meet an old acquaintance, who wants to settle old scores before his demise. In Japan we get some gorgeous scenery, nice atmosphere, intriguing settings, believable characters, all that good stuff.<br/><br/>I especially liked Tao Okamoto's character Mariko, the granddaughter of Wolverine's old friend. Jackman and Okamoto have brilliant chemistry together and when the movie slows down during the second act to give them time to simply interact with one another, it feels justified. Usually that kind of slowing down in an action movie feels boring and unneeded, even sappy, but here it works because the actors have the skills to pull it off. Which is a great thing, because it gives the movie more depth and we get a chance to know Wolverine in a new way that the Origins movie tried to reach, but never could because of its lack of emotional maturity.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this film has one major flaw and that is the unbelievably weak villain, known as Viper. Her actress, Svetlana Khodchenkova, just doesn't have the screen presence or acting skills to give the character any memorable attributes. She merely stands there, struts around in her skintight suit and spouts the dialogue. That's it. Sure part of that is poor writing, but it's still rather jarring because the two main protagonists are so damn good. If only the villain had been as good, this could easily have been one of the best Marvel movies yet made.<br/><br/>As it is, it's still fine. The two main characters are very good, most of the side characters do a good job as well, the action works wonderfully, the Japanese setting gives the film a nice coating of majesty and even the story, while nothing that extraordinary, functions well enough for us to enjoy it. The villain is weak, very weak in fact, which keeps the film from being great, but you can overlook it and focus on the good stuff."
"stationary315","1","58","98","20 August 2013"," Not Worth my $8.50
","There were so many things wrong with this movie that I'm sure I'll forget something. First off, I'm a huge fan of the X-Men characters and story, that being said, this should NOT be included as a film in that series. <br/><br/>First off, WE GET IT. WOLVERINE DOES THE HEALING THING. CAN'T DIE. It is NOT necessary to stop all action every time he's injured, wait until he's done healing, and then continue fighting. It happens in every fight scene in this movie, which, by the way is all this movie is. There's a cute scene between him and Marikol (that later has NO significance WHATSOEVER), but besides that the whole movie seems to be fight scene after fight scene.<br/><br/>Also seemed to me that Wolverine had probably 20 too many ""one liners"", and while a few were pretty funny- not all 50 were. It would have been nice to have some real dialouge. It probably would have helped clear up all the confusion we experienced with the plot of the movie. On that note, I thought the X-Men franchise was supposed to be about MUTANTS. That's been the deal thus far, but this movie went political, brought a bunch of humans into it, and seemed to forget about the mutants. Are we living in a world where everyone is OK with mutants? Is this supposed to be before or after Logan's time at the school with Professor X? We don't know, because there is NO interaction with anyone except the main characters. (I would have much rather gone to a movie about Storm's history, or Professor X's history, OR EVEN JEANNE'S HISTORY, instead of ANOTHER one about Logan. One was perfect- this one was NOT.) And the whole scene at the beginning was pointless. WHy do we care that Logan is a mountain man who cares about bears and avenges their deaths? Was the poisoned arrow supposed to have a connection to the lizard girl? What's her deal? Where'd she come from? Why does she wear those ridiculous outfits? What was the point of the scene where she pulls her skin off? Although it was cool, I guess, it seemed to have no point- no reason to be in the movie. Maybe she's Mystique's sister...That would have made sense. <br/><br/>OH. And don't get me started on the logic of how the hell little old Logan is able to tackle the 2 story pure Adamantium robot powered by an almost dead jerk off who wants Logan's power. What's is deal anyway? Most guys would be thankful their life was saved ONCE... and not shoot for immortality. No one cares if you ""aren't ready to die"", you aren't a mutant, so get over it and leave Logan alone. . And at the end it is NOT clear in any way whether or not Logan can heal anymore. Did he magically get his power back and they just forgot to include that detail? Or were we supposed to gather that he can't heal anymore, since the weird Asian mutant is now his ""bodyguard""? And what was the point of him ""falling in love"" with Marikol? He just leaves her. <br/><br/>Why did we find out about the true plot behind the ENTIRE movie 15 minutes before the screen went black and credits rolled?<br/><br/>Why was he shot in the back with 100 poisonous arrows, intending to keep him from breaking into the building, and then brought into the building..? And why did he fall face down in the snow like a penguin who waddled too fast? That was horrendus. He lost his bad-ass status with that move. How is it possible for him to be riding a motorcycle in the slippery snow? Why the hell is he wearing a wife beater tank top and a jacket in the snow? Why does the army of ninjas 1. wait to attack him until he's healed back up again, and 2. only come at him 1 by 1? Not very ninja-like. <br/><br/>What was the point of Marikol's friend in the movie? To predict the future that we NEVER saw come true accurately? She sucked. She was a terrible actress, and her hair was awful, and there was no point in her being there- there was no scene that portrayed to us any kind of real relationship she and Marikol had. But I guess she maybe does martial arts? <br/><br/>I've also caught myself wondering what the point of half of the movie was. Why couldn't we have found out about the bad grandfather and the ENTIRE PLOT OF THE MOVIE **BEFORE** IT ENDED. THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED MAKE IT A GOOD MOVIE. IT WOULD HAVE AT LEAST MADE SENSE. <br/><br/>While I can handle plot-inconsistencies, or stupid mistakes, or cheesy lines, I learned this evening that I cannot handle all of that in ONE movie. It's too much. To not have a clue what's going on, have to deal with crappy writing, and rookie mistakes is too much. There are so many more things I could rant about, but I doubt anyone made it to the end of this review at this point, so I'll end with that. <br/><br/>OH. And despite the terrible acting around him, the horrible one liners he had to deliver due to a terrible writer / director, Hugh Jackman did incredible well with the part, and his image in my mind remains untarnished. I was also impressed with Marikol's performance. Though she was a pretty shallow character, she really played her part well. Kudos to you two."
"tdub154420","9","225","421","26 July 2013"," Enjoyment will depend on familiarity.
","First and foremost I must say that I absolutely loved this movie. But as I will cover in my review it may largely be due to the fact that I have always held the source material of this film in very high regard. Having said that, I do recognize that their may be a sliding scale of enjoyability for this film. If you are a fan of the 1983 Claremont/Miller miniseries of Wolverine then this is the movie you have been waiting for. If you are fond of the character Wolverine and interested into delving deeper into his chronology and exploring his inner conflicts, you will certainly enjoy this movie. If however, you have no familiarity, or no desire to familiarize with the character of Wolverine, you may find yourself not caring about many of the slower moments and longing for a more evenly paced action film.<br/><br/>Fans of Claremont's Wolverine rejoice, this Wolverine does it right. The film does its best keeping characters intact while deviating from the comics in the sake of a self contained story and grander character development. There are several of the shots in this film that are near recreations of the comic's original panels, and although story lines have been shifted and shuffled in some places, its all there. Mariko, Yukio, Harada, Shingen and Viper may develop differently than in the comic series, but their relation to each other and contextual significance is intact. As a Wolverine fan it was also nice to see a meaningful relationship blossom between Wolverine and Mariko, unlike the comics where it really is love at first sight. Instead here Wolverine falls in love not entirely with the character of Mariko, but rather with the idea of being a protector, a take that is a welcome addition to the Claremont storyline. The characters of Silver Samurai and Viper undergo the largest facelift in this film, but it isn't entirely out of place. Let us not forget they were involved in the X Men issues directly connecting to the Wolverine miniseries. Although their characters have undertaken slight adjustments in order to incorporate ideas from the Fatal Attractions storyline, the plot does well to take from Wolverine's side of this storyline because it was one of the few times in the series where Logan did feel vulnerable. Many fans will recognize that the plot device and character of Master Yashida cannot be found in any of the original comics, but one must keep in mind it serves as a useful device to connect all the developments of Logan's journey. All in all I think its the best character study of Wolverine that any fan could ask for. Wolverine struggles with his animalistic urges and his commitment to reform, he grapples to find meaning in his endless immortality, and he ultimately finds purpose and resolution that he had not before. None of these developments are significantly or profoundly discovered, rather they are slowly revealed, which may turn casual movie goers off from enjoying this film. As a thoughtful exploration of Wolverine's character and a grand homage to incredible source material though, how can any Wolverine fan say no to this movie? It is the best X-Men movie and one of the best comic based movies.<br/><br/>For those who would not consider themselves fans, but are rather moviegoers intent on enjoying a superhero epic, be warned. This film is a character study, it does not grapple with any conflicts outside of Wolverine's internal struggles. The world is not being threatened, and not many lives outside of Logan's are even being threatened, so the storyline does not crescendo in epic suspense like the Avengers or the Dark Knight. So for those not invested in Wolverine's personal self discovery, some of the action can seem unmotivated and the pacing an obstacle to satisfaction. The film does its job in providing action sequences, but it intersperses several moments of symbolic soul searching, cryptic metaphors and relationship building that serve as pavement for Wolverine's self discovery. This movie can still be enjoyable without interest in Wolverine's inner conflicts however. With an outstanding supporting cast, a beautiful setting, and gripping and intense action sequences, it plays a lot like a token Bond film for those unfamiliar with Wolverine.<br/><br/>Whether you are familiar with the original comics or not, this movie will certainly provide entertaining thrills and intriguing themes. If, however, you are a fan of the original comic books, this film is a wonderful achievement."
"adam-moore1308","8","249","481","23 July 2013"," This could be the Wolverine movie fans always wanted.
","2009's X-men Origins: Wolverine was received negatively by both critics and the majority of the fans of the character. Now the character has a chance to redeem himself with this year's the Wolverine and for the most part he does. This film has really tried to please the fans as it was loosely based on the beloved Japan story line from the comics and it is clear that the film has tried to fix the problems that were complained about in the previous solo Wolverine film. Despite taking place after the events of X-men: The Last Stand this film attempts to distance itself from the rest of the X-men characters and story and focuses solely on the Wolverine character and as a result this film feels very different to all previous X-men films. This allows for the best portrayal of Wolverine's character that we have seen so far and Hugh Jackman also delivers his best performance of the character to date. I really enjoyed the pacing of the film as well because although it was a face paced action film it wasn't afraid to slow things down and develop the characters and the relationships between them. However it never slows down for too long before it picks up the pace with another action scene. The action in this film is also very well done because every sequence is creative and has a purpose so it never feels like the mindless action we've come to expect in big budget summer films. Humour is also used effectively in this film as the writers take advantage of Wolverine's IDGAF attitude. However the film isn't perfect as there is one other mutant character that occasionally seems slightly out of place and some people might find her character a bit too over the top. Also from time to time it does feel like they are playing it too safe to insure that they don't make any of the same mistakes as the last Wolverine film. Overall The Wolverine, although not perfect, is a fun superhero film that gets a lot of things right about what makes the Wolverine character so popular."
"valhallex","1","59","105","10 August 2013"," Sooo disappointed...
","I was really looking forward to see this movie, and had a feeling it was going to be just as good, or even better than some of the other movies in this genre that has been released lately. I loved Man of Steel, for example. The Wolverine starts off with some really boring sequences, but as a Wolverine/X-Men fan I really thought that soon I was going sit on the edge of my seat. The aggressive Wolverine is about to cut open some hillbilly bear hunters, because they have wounded a bear with a toxic dart. OK, I think, stupid reason to fight, but hey, let's just have fun and watch this piles of dirt get what they deserve from a real superhero! But a female ninja enters the bar, cuts a chair in half, slice the bottom of a beer-bottle with a magnificent sword, and ends it all before something happens for us to see.. So much for the action for the first half of the film. A viper-woman then drains Wolverine for his powers. When he gets his healing powers back(by pulling his own heart out - this is BTW a cool scene!!), he is beaten/sliced to pieces by a normal man who has trained karate! If he didn't have his healing power he would be dead by now. Really disappointing to see one of my favorite superheroes, the Wolverine, who stands up to Hulk in the cartoons, be sliced to pieces by a 50 year old man. So much for fighting skills and super strength..... Involved in this film is a great ninja clan. They forgot to rehearse hiding, so the main ninja unluckily sits on top of the roof where everyone can see him. Well, well. Ninjas can do a lot of other stuff. The movie is just a dull love story for much part. Really boring and stupid. In the final battle the villain in the form of a robot with a man inside(who is not tall enough to see over the robots neck), kick Wolverines ass. Luckily the lead ninja hits the robot with an arrow in the eye, and we can finish this movie off with some really stupid lines, before Wolverine takes off, leaving his woman behind.<br/><br/>This was such a bad movie that for the first time in my life I was considering leaving the theater. I regret that I didn't..."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","93","185","26 July 2013"," Character-focused 'The Wolverine' gives Wolvie the story he needed, not the dazzling blockbuster
","Throughout the course of the modern superhero era, one thing has stayed true: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. After being a successful piece of the ""X-Men"" franchise for three films, Wolverine got his own solo gig in 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which turned out to be a chaotic smear of superhero film with a cliché-ridden script. Jackman, who has become synonymous with the part in a way that would make even Robert Downey Jr. jealous, deserved better.<br/><br/>Thankfully, ""The Wolverine"" is better. In fact, it bounces back from the very worst failings of ""Origins,"" telling a character-oriented story that borrows from the Chris Claremont-Frank Miller comic featuring Wolverine's Japanese saga.<br/><br/>The story takes place post-""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" as Logan is haunted in his dreams by Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), whom he killed in that film in order to essentially save the world. Hiding out and looking like an imprisoned Jean Valjean somewhere in Alaska (he tends to do that), a Japanese woman named Yukio (Rila Fukushima) finds him and convinces him to travel back with her to Japan to meet her master, Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), whom Wolverine saved during the bombing of Nagasaki in World War II. Yashida is one of Japan's wealthiest men, a technology entrepreneur, and he wants to offer Wolverine the one thing he's never had – mortality. For someone who feels as though their gift has been a curse lately, it's an appealing offer.<br/><br/>Of course there has to be a catch, and Wolverine soon finds himself dealing with the venomous Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and going on the run and protecting Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto), who is being sought after by the Yakuza (Japanese mob).<br/><br/>The film almost never leaves Wolverine's side, and provides more than adequate motivational fuel for us to become invested in the story. Wolverine's consideration of his own inner pain and immortality finally gives Jackman something to work with, despite how good he is with all the more exterior elements of the character.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold (""Walk the Line"" and the underrated remake of ""3:10 to Yuma"") excels at finding these character moments, while also taking the opportunity to make a Marvel samurai movie. The film's fight sequences take a visceral yet artistic approach reminiscent of a samurai film: violent, but stylized. An R-rated version, however, would've made this an exceptional film, but such is Hollywood.<br/><br/>In summer after summer of large-scale blockbusters with immense action sequences, ""The Wolverine"" will be a tad underwhelming for anyone impartial to the character that is just looking for the ""next big movie."" Again, this movie is as much about Wolverine's internal struggle as what's happening on screen. It is exciting in small ways, not in big ways (outside of a sequence on top a bullet train). Mangold also does some cool things with a chase sequence through Tokyo in which the archer Harada (Will Yun Lee) snipes Yakuza thugs as Wolverine runs with Mariko.<br/><br/>A lot of props go to the script team of Mark Bomback (""Unstoppable,"" ""Total Recall"") and Scott Frank (""Minority Report""), who revised the initial draft by Oscar winner Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects""). Obviously the character element of the story works well, but the pacing is strong and surprises wait at every turn, even if the plot trajectory follows a pretty traditional superhero movie structure.<br/><br/>To put ""The Wolverine"" in the context of the ever-growing rolodex of superhero movies, it's a rock-solid, entertaining, better-than-most entry, but years from now, will probably get overlooked among the genre's best thanks to the visually ground-breaking event films now and soon to be even more prevalent. It does little to stand out, but the Wolverine character didn't need something to make him stand out; it needed something more personal. Why else would you isolate a character from the X-Men if not to tell his personal story? ""The Wolverine"" is a superb film that should've come out four years ago, when it would've been a great film. If it were an origin story and not the fifth time Jackman put the claws on (not counting his ""X-Men: First Class"" cameo), I would put it on par with ""Iron Man"" minus some of the flashy CGI and a decent percentage of humor. There's no question Wolverine's lack of novelty will play a factor for those who find it unimpressive, but getting down to what it means to make a good superhero film, you can't go wrong with the model used in ""The Wolverine."" And fans will genuinely be excited about what Wolverine does next, with or without the X-Men.<br/><br/>~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more"
"StarkTech","Null","67","137","24 July 2013"," Tremendously Smart and Engaging. A Joy To Watch!
","If there's one major element that truly sets this picture apart from any other standard ""solid"" comic book movie is the way through which the director communicates the experience of being Wolverine. His healing factor and the idea of out-living everyone you know is daunting and depressing. Finding purpose after facing true vulnerability adds so much to the character and FAR more than we've seen before. Tremendous visual and emotional imagery is presented throughout the movie and provides the viewer with greater insight into the hero and even the villains. This one screams quality from the opening through the amazing final act. I've seen it mentioned that the resolution deviates from the comic books but I honestly couldn't care less. What hits the screen more then works in movie form.<br/><br/>For those going into this flick expecting simple fun, prepare to enjoy but prepare to be surprised. Fun is not the only piece of this pie. In fact, I think movie fans of all kind will be stunned at how many levels this movie delivers upon. This is an action packed but surprisingly deep film that, for me, really delivers. The Wolverine will leave your movie-going senses on high and I honestly can't wait to see it again."
"quinnox-1","8","71","146","30 July 2013"," Great entertainment, made for adults
","This is not another light and fluffy comic book super hero movie. This movie actually has depth and substance to it, and there are not fight scenes taking place every few minutes like in most comic book movies lately. It is more of a deep character study of the Wolverine. I thought it was unexpectedly good, with Jackman doing a superb job in the lead role, as a tortured hero, who seems as if he no longer wants to go on living his near immortal existence because of deep regrets and guilt he is feeling about things that happened in the past.<br/><br/>But it is not all doom and gloom, there are indeed fight scenes, and they are what you would expect of a summer blockbuster type movie. The last fight scene involving a giant robot-like Samurai is especially spectacular. Just don't expect the fight scenes to be the main focus of the movie, this is more about the Wolverine and his inner struggles of conscience. I liked it very much."
"freemantle_uk","8","57","115","26 July 2013"," A return to form for The Wolverine
","Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's 1982 Japanese story arc is one of the most famous and celebrated in comic book history. It has finally been the cinematic treatment, amidst a loose adaptation and watches out the taste of Wolverine's first solo outing.<br/><br/>After the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan (Hugh Jackman) has living alone in the Canadian wilderness and suffering from recurring dreams about Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and guilt about her death. As Logan challenges a group of illegal hunters in a bar, he is found by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a woman recruited to bring The Wolverine to Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), a dying Japanese industrialist he saved when he was a Prisoner of War outside Nagasaki.<br/><br/>In Japan, Yashida gives Logan an offer to take his healing factor and make Wolverine mortal. But even though Wolverine refuses his powers are taken from him anyway and he is thrown into a family industrial struggle involving the Yakuza, a clan of ninjas, a corrupt Japanese government minister and a mysterious biochemist mutant known as The Viper (Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova who performs with a flawless American accent). As Wolverine protects Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), from all these factions, he also begins to see what it can be like to live a normal life.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine had many problems, misjudged humour, awful special effects, subpar action, awful writing and introducing characters just for the sake of fan service. The Wolverine does rectify many of these problems and director James Mangold had much more free reign then Gavin Hood had.<br/><br/>Mangold knew what made the best X-Men films work, so he focuses on character development and more brooding drama and it is complemented by an excellent performance from Jackman. Jackman gives us the Wolverine of old, a character who is haunted, suffering from nightmares and guilt, looking for a reason to give his life meaning as well as giving us the gruff wit we know and love from Wolverine. The Wolverine is a much darker film, more akin to X-Men and X2 which it needed to be. Yet the film still has a massive injection of fun which you would expect from a film featuring mutants, samurais and ninjas.<br/><br/>While The Wolverine has an expected PG-13 rating, Mangold does push it to the limit. We see Wolverine sliding his way through Yakuza thugs, having his flesh scorched off by the nuclear blast and our hero having to operate on himself. There is solid action throughout the film and the more cheesy elements has been removed in The Wolverine, with the only misjudged sequence being the Bullet Train fight sequence, as it comes off a little goofy. Comedy has also been cut, with The Wolverine having two overtly comic sequences and Wolverine having a few comic remarks, but they are actually inkeeping with the character.<br/><br/>As an adaptation of the Japanese miniseries, The Wolverine had to take liberties to make it work with the film series' continuity (though continuity is now very screwed up in the X-Men series). Yukio is no longer the ambiguous assassin with a danger complex and her colour are nailed on the mast, Mariko and Logan having no prior relationship, Mariko's father (Hiroyuki Sanada) is a combination of her father and husband in the comic and the Viper has no role in the original comic are just some of the changes that were made. But these are changes that are easy to look past, even though on a personal standpoint it would have been nice to see more of the parallels between Wolverine and Yukio. The changes to the Silver Samurai will be a bit harder to swallow for comic book fans and it is when the film loses it way a little with its action climax.<br/><br/>The Wolverine had a number of villains and it does result in problems. The first one is the film does not know who to make the main villain before settling on Viper, who does have a commanding presence on screen. The other is due to the number of factions in play, which makes many of the characters a bit underdeveloped. One character that suffered this was Will Yun Lee's Harada, the head of the ninja who did have an interesting character who was loyal to Mariko.<br/><br/>The Wolverine does have some script problems and the final act is a more generic affair, but its clear that Mangold and Jackman do have a good understanding of the character and they put the cinematic version of Wolverine in good standing.<br/><br/>And on a final note, the post credit scene is a must see: it is one of best and most tantalising in a long time.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"
"hbk_nwo33","7","25","46","25 August 2013"," Logan finally gets a stand-alone film to do him justice
","Logan's latest adventure is undeniably a step-up from X-Men Origins: Wolverine but it falls short of the standard set by X-Men: First Class.<br/><br/>It was great to see Logan out of his usual environment, and it was a fresh location for superhero films in general from their usual US base but for the most part, especially the action scenes, they could have been anywhere. The Japanese location felt underutilised in setting this film apart from others in its genre. The action scenes are good, even if they do raise a few continuity questions, and the last third of the film is certainly filled with action, twists and turns. James Mangold managed to succeed where Origins did not, he managed to introduce a whole cast of characters but they generally all felt developed and not just crammed in for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The film's biggest disappointment though was that it felt like it slipped back into the comfort of it's western formula, taking it from achieving the potential the story had, especially when Darren Aronofsky was attached to direct. The source material presented an opportunity for Logan's darkest and edgiest movie yet, but what we gets feels familiar but in a new location. Where it does set itself apart from previous entries with its dream sequences, which vary from good to distracting, but at least they tried something new.<br/><br/>Make sure you don't leave the cinema when the credits hit though, if you've not learnt the Marvel formula yet then you might want to consider doing so.<br/><br/>Overall, The Wolverine is a fun film but one that falls short of its potential. Hugh Jackman is still a perfect fit for Logan, and it was a nice change to see the character in a new environment and in his own story (Origins was not really a solo outing)."
"aaronjbong","8","31","60","27 July 2013"," Wolverine's True Comeback
","Wolverine is finally back, and this new installment in the ""X-Men"" franchise is extremely slick, exhilarating, and top-notch. Forget the disappointing ""Origins"" 4 years ago, this is the real Wolverine movie. It's action-packed, dark, occasionally humorous, and surprisingly has depth. It may not be the best ""X-Men"" film but ""The Wolverine"" is a solid entry that will help the ""X-Men"" franchise recover from the disappointing ""Last Stand"" and ""Origins"". <br/><br/>In this installment, Wolverine is struggling with his immortality. His lover, Jean Grey died way back in ""The Last Stand"" and he's been suffering from an endless period of nightmares. It feels as if he has nothing to do on this Earth and he's longing to re-join his lover in the other side. But when an old acquaintance Yashida (a man who Wolverine saved during the 1945 bombing of Nagasaki) invites him to Japan and offers to remove his immortality, Wolverine is delved into new territory. <br/><br/>There are two women who work alongside Wolverine here. First, there's Mariko Yashida, the granddaughter of Yashida and the chosen heiress to the throne. When she takes her grandfather's role, she will become the most powerful person in Japan and will need protection from the endless hordes of the Yakuza. The other person is the pink-haired Yukio who is an excellent fighter and form a great team with Wolverine. <br/><br/>""The Wolverine"" is set in an environment new to the ""X-Men"" franchise, Japan. The vibrant colors, tall buildings, beautiful scenery are used in a maximizing manner. The action scenes look really well in this new setting. <br/><br/>What made ""The Wolverine"" more engaging was that we finally get to see Logan mortal. He literally will get hurt if he gets shot or cut. For the first time ever, he is no longer invincible and this escalates the tension every time he's in a fight against an adversary. We see Wolverine lingering in the boundary between life and death. Wounded. <br/><br/>Then we have the action sequences which are extremely intense. The climax was gripping but I also expressed extreme fondness for the action scene where Wolverine battled against several Yakuza members on top of a lightning-fast moving bullet train. That scene was extremely suspenseful and was one of the highlights, at least for me. Don't get me wrong, the other action sequences were fun too but that bullet train scene was just amazing. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman returns once again as the ageless Logan aka Wolverine. As usual, his performance is strong, gritty, and excellent. The only difference between his performance here and ""Origins"" is that his performance here is not burdened by an awful script as it was in ""Origins"". The other performances were powerful too. Tao Okamoto was perfect as the heiress Mariko Yashida and Rila Fukushima was bad-ass as Yukio. Everyone of the cast was good. <br/><br/>All in all, ""The Wolverine"" is solid, action-packed and a satisfying addition to the ""X-Men"" franchise. It has incredible action scenes, solid acting, and a great script. However, I did find something nit-picking (no spoilers here but it concerns Logan's ability to recall a certain memory). Nonetheless, ""The Wolverine"" is successfully in continuing the revival of the ""X-Men"" franchise and only gets me more hyped about next year's ""Days of Future Past"". And watch out for the post-credits scene in the end. <br/><br/>Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Forget ""Origins"", ""The Wolverine"" is a terrific new entry in the ""X-Men"" franchise that serves as the Wolverine movie we all wanted."

","Alright, firstly i'll start off by preparing myself for all the flack you fanboys want to throw my way. However, i'm entitled to my opinion just as much as you're entitled to yours so i can say what i want about The Wolverine.<br/><br/>I went into the film expecting very little but it somehow managed to surprise me and deliver even less than i had expected, i'm not one of these uber comic fans that compares everything to the graphic novels then complains when it isn't exactly the same, but if major changes are being made then i feel they should benefit the story. which is where The Wolverine is lacking, the story is paper-thin and guessable from the first half hour alone. i'd like to step around the plot holes but they are so damn wide it would be impossible to do so, my major gripe being how can Adamantium be broken by more Adamantium? i get that the sword was superheated but we've established in the previous X- Men films that Adamantium is unbreakable when hardened but somehow that rule is changed as and when to suit the film. The other massive hole i can't get my head around is how does Wolverine even remember Yashida? this is supposedly set in the canon of after the Last Stand, but Wolverine had all his memories prior to Origins wiped in Origins and as far as i recall he never got them back so surely his memory of Yashida in World War 2 would have gone? If you have an answer for that i would love to hear it too.<br/><br/>I didn't go into Wolverine wanting much but it failed to deliver on nearly every level from the awful story to the terrible character development. And as for the sneaky credit scene i dread to think how the X-Men universe of Fox will tackle a subject as difficult as Time Travel to explain itself.<br/><br/>Simply put; i'd save my money, ignore the fanboys and wait for the next offering from the Marvel/Disney team to fulfill your superhero fix."

In a sense that if he has his healing factor, you better get creative on how to kill the Mofo. Cause it ain't going to be easy. <br/><br/>We see wolverine dealing with a lot more than he has ever had to deal with in this movie. Losing his healing factor is just one of the many things.

There is a scene in the beginning of the film that deals with a grizzly... it really makes an effort to get you to understand Logans character. <br/><br/>Now... what fans will complain about. Never suits up. Silver Samurai is a Mecha and totally butchered the origin. Some fight scenes are cut short while some drama character developing scenes seem to drag on.

","It has been some time since the events of X-Men: The Last Stand. Logan (Hugh Jackman), the honorable yet brutal warrior of the mutant super team, has grown disenchanted with life and is living in the wilderness of Canada. Haunted by memories of his lost love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), the loner is a victim of his own immortality. He has all the time in the world, but nothing left to live for.<br/><br/>That is until Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a messenger from a man he once saved many years before named Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) , tracks him down with a luring proposition. Yashida , now a technology mogul, is nearing the end of his life. He claims that before he passes, he wishes to grant Logan the gift of mortality in exchange for saving his life so many years ago.<br/><br/>Of course, everything is not as it seems. And it is not long before Logan is caught up in family politics involving Yashida's heirs: fiery son Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada) and captivating granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamato). After Yakuza goons make an attempt to kidnap Mariko, Logan rescues her and finds new purpose in keeping her protected. As they camp out in hiding, the two fall for each other and he is able to find relief in confessing his past to her. But peace does not last for long as Mariko is eventually snatched away from him, leading the Wolverine to give chase and track her down by any means necessary.<br/><br/>The thing that makes The Wolverine work on so many levels is its maturity. Christopher Nolan showed with his Batman trilogy that superhero movies could be loyal to the sometimes serious tone of comics but still be accessible to the masses. Movies based on Marvel characters for the most part have not followed suit. While entertaining, the Marvel movies (the Punishers being the exception) have been light hearted affairs that focus more on action and laughs than story or character development. Logan, however, is a serious character with grown up problems who deserves a script to reflect that. Director James Mangold and Jackman have a done a solid job in bringing that angst to the screen. The Frank Miller and Chris Claremont penned story arc that Mangold and his crew of writers have borrowed from for this movie is considered to be one of the best in Wolverine canon. In fact, the first two-thirds of The Wolverine are so good at developing the mutant's character, that viewers do not even notice the lack of constant action scenes that are so prevalent in superhero films today. It is a testament to Jackman's now effortless portrayal of the troubled protagonist and also to Mangold's ability to match the atmosphere of the dark content of early Wolverine comics.<br/><br/>This is not to say that The Wolverine lacks explosiveness. There is just enough fighting and chases throughout those aforementioned first two-thirds, and a little too much of it in the final act. It is in the final act where Mangold slips a little, digressing back into a standard Marvel piece heavy on smoke and mirrors instead of genuine substance. But Marvel's smoke and mirrors still outdazzle most of its competition on any given movie night and audiences will not be let down here."

","This is the worst X-men film to date. Many of the earlier films suffer from the rating restriction imposed by the need for a large under-age viewer-ship. They are not gritty, they lack the adult character relationships lack depth, and are too focused on action with minimal blood. This movie seems to have made an attempt to be more ""adult"" by throwing a few curse words in, but fails in the adult movie department for starters because the plot just doesn't make any sense. From the bear scenario at the beginning of the film, things are already looking pretty direction-less, and it does not get better as Logan enters the country of the samurai. The fight scenes are too fast, filmed too closely, poorly sound-tracked (metal on metal sound every time an adamantium claw enters someone's body, a bus, a tree), and not believable. Sometimes Wolverine ""lets"" people get him down just so another ""hero"" can save him, and throughout the film he takes on injuries that a hundreds of years old warrior trained in every martial art should have learned to avoid by now. Fans who have followed Wolverine from comic book to television show to film will wretch at this movie more than the first Wolverine title because it does not portray anything of what makes Logan's story so compelling. How he became what he is, the relationships he has had, the emotional baggage he carries, and not being sure where he stands in the mutant struggle for equality. Logan is an emotionally complex individual, one who has had and lost, seen people be born and grow old and dynasties rise and fall. The movie fails to convey any of this intellectually, showing only a lonely man living in a cave in Alaska with a serious look on his face who immediately falls in love with a girl, fights a bunch of Japanese with no cause themselves for the next hour, and then gets on a plane with another girl. The dream sequences with Jean Grey are extraneous and at the end of the movie Wolverine fights a giant robot that was designed specifically to take his powers by a person who has every reason to be his friend. I am not sure anyone who could review this film positively saw the same movie as me. I want my two hours back."

The story itself is definitely an improvement to it's predecessors (Except First Class) and teases a larger universe Fox is preparing in order to compete with Marvel Studios.<br/><br/>From a filmmaker's perspective, the movie's cinematography was okay. The funeral scene could have been much better in terms of directing and blocking. The acting was impressive but felt a little cheesy in some parts. Hugh Jackman rocks this role and I have to give Rila Fukushima props considering this is her performance in a feature film. Bravo.<br/><br/>The twist was predictable towards the beginning but James Magnold has done a great job distracting the audience from it....only for a while.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with beautiful Japanese culture and scenery. The production design was remarkable and it surely gave the movie a sense of beautiful imagery.<br/><br/>The movie kept me entertained and was better than I expected. I recommend watching it as soon as possible. <br/><br/>Also, make sure to stay after the credits....you won't regret it."

","After the debacle that is 'Origins: Wolverine,' the character has finally been given the proper treatment all fans have been waiting for.<br/><br/>In 'The Wolverine,'a tormented Logan must come to terms with the loss of Jean Grey,the love of his life. After years of wandering, he meets Yukio, an assassin from Japan who is sent to fetch Logan on behalf of her master (Yashida), who Logan saved during the attack on Nagasaki in 1945. Here is where Logan meets another possible love interest, who he strives to protect from the Yakusa.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Famke Janssen's Jean Grey appears--guiding and tormenting Logan until he finally learns to accept that the past cannot be undone.

"jon.h.ochiai","10","32","64","28 July 2013"," Jackman is The Wolverine
","Hugh Jackman is awesome in ""The Wolverine"". As hero Logan he commands the screen. He is absolutely shredded, and fights with fierce samurai skills. Jackman authentically explores Logan's despair in his immortal fate with the Director James Mangold's envisioning of Wolverine's search for purpose. Jackman is deftly droll as Logan, hiding a well of emotion. ""The Wolverine"" ebbs on the verge of great with resonant values of mortality, purpose, and honor.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an amazing news reel-like sequence of Nagasaki in World War II. Logan selflessly saves his captor Japanese officer Yashida (young Ken Yamanouchi) from the atomic bomb explosion. In present day Logan (Jackman) returns to the site with Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (stunning and beautiful Tao Okamoto). She recalls her grandfather's stories. She tells Logan, ""Everything finds peace eventually."" This gets lost in the last 20 minutes of the movie when it implodes into standard action mayhem.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank is based on classic storyline by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller as Logan travels back to Japan. Though familiar, but not having read it, some of the appealing back story is displaced. ""The Wolverine"" misses the profound opportunity to show Logan become samurai. Battling vicious Yakuza at the Shinto ceremony is elegantly spectacular. The martial arts are exquisite. Hiroyuki Sanada (of ""The Last Samurai"") is world class. As Shingen his katana duel with the Wolverine is signature precision. Rila Fukushima as Logan's ""protector"" Yukio is so cool with thrusting staff and kicks.<br/><br/>Jackman as Logan fights in deadly martial arts style. It is weird that Logan's samurai skills are not really explained, though he is rogue samurai—Ronin without master or purpose. He comments on Shingen's kendo mastery display, ""He's good."" A clue? Too bad samurai themes of mortality and fatalism are not more fleshed out. Jackman and Mangold hint with Logan's seeming restraint. Wolverine's ""beserker"" rage has element of focus. I was expecting ""The Last Samurai"" meets the Wolverine, but unfortunately not. The sword fight on top of the Bullet Train is breathtaking, and the Ninja archers in the snowy village are high drama. Given the tantalizing set up, we really don't get eloquent resolution of Mariko's deserved peace or the discovery of one's purpose in mortality .<br/><br/>To that end we find Logan having nightmares about his beloved Jean Grey. Famke Jassen is beautiful and strangely haunting. Logan poignantly wishes for death. However, his regenerative powers make him virtually immortal. Since Jean's death, he lives alone in the icy woods of Alaska. About to exact revenge on reckless grizzly bear hunters, Logan is saved from himself by J-pop warrior Yukio (strong and spirited Rila Fukushima). She has been looking for him for over a year. Yashida is dying of cancer and would like to see Logan. Yashida (solid Harahiko Yamanouchi) is now the richest man in the World. He offers to repay Logan with is mortality—""Eternity can be a curse."" Logan says. ""You don't want what I got."" Logan becomes immersed in the Family drama. Shingen (Sanada) and his daughter Mariko clash over who will be heir to the Yashida Empire. Mariko is in a beneficial, but loveless engagement to Noburo (good snakelike Brian Tee). Mariko has a protector in Harada (brave Will Yun Lee), former lover. The mysterious Viper (enigmatic and evil Svetlana Khodchenkova) may have secretly weakened Logan.<br/><br/>Twists ensue and Logan becomes Mariko's savior and defender. I actually think their love story is inspired. Jackman and Okamoto have a touching chemistry. Again like much of narrative, we miss a gratifying payoff. ""The Wolverine"" is an awesome action movie, and Mangold generates beauty with Japanese locals and distinct culture. Through all this Hugh Jackman commands ""The Wolverine"" and makes it worth watching. Jackman is powerful. He genuinely enrolls us in Logan's vulnerability tempered with his great courage. He is amazing. He makes us pull for the poetic samurai conclusion. ""The Wolverine"" and Hugh Jackman are amazing."
"Scarecrow-88","9","18","33","29 July 2013"," The Wolverine
","In this exciting Wolverine tale, Hugh Jackman returns as the brooding mutant with adamantium claws, still haunted by the loss of his beloved Jean Grey (the goddess, Famke Janssen) whose ""spirit"" visits him often in his dreams. He has been hermitting in some rural wilderness (where giant grizzlies and human hunters equally frequent), found while predisposed with barfly hunters (one of whom used a poison-tipped arrow to down a bear) by a highly trained fighter from Tokyo named Yukio (Rila Fukushima). Yukio has orders to bring Logan to Tokyo to ""say goodbye"" to her mentor (and the man who raised her), Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi). Logan had saved Yashida's life when Nagasaki was bombed in WWII. Yashida (who had developed a technological empire in Tokyo) is dying and wants to be immortal, offering a chance for Logan to die a human death in exchange for his eternal power. Logan is stunned by this but Yashida supposedly dies not long after the proposition. When Yashida's ""nurse"" (a chemist with a vast knowledge in toxins), Viper (the deliciously wicked, luscious Svetlana Khodchenkova, having a field day as the nasty, but delectable heavy) ""poisons"" Logan while he sleeps, causing him to feel pain and lose the ability to heal immediately after harm; when wounded, he'll need medical attention. And does he ever bleed and suffer during this movie! Yashida leaves his empire to his granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), much to the disgust of his insidious son, Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada, a nasty piece of work) who himself longed for the lofty power of such a position. There's an attempt to kidnap Mariko by the Yakuza, and Logan will take it upon himself to protect her. It seems everyone is out to either capture or harm Mariko and while vulnerable after Viper's handiwork, the Wolverine will still put up quite a fight, using his claws to full effect. Also showing up in the film is Will Yun Lee as a former childhood boyfriend (and disciple of the house of Yashida), Harada, and the sleazy Brian Tee as the arranged fiancé for Mariko, Noburo. Harada is handy with a crossbow, Noburo has political ties (and a taste for American hookers), and Viper has an agenda that will surprise both Mariko and Logan. Viper likes to use her acidic breath to spread a ""death kiss"" or leave marks on those that provoke her anger, even peeling away her skin at one point when suffering a bad fall towards the end. <br/><br/>There's plenty of action in the refreshing Tokyo setting: a phenomenal chase through the streets and buildings heading into (and on top of) a bullet train, with Harada scaling atop the rooftops with graceful agility, and the conclusion (into a village that leads to a large fortress) includes ninjas (the roped arrows, some tipped with poison by Harada, sticking from Logan's back is an amazing visual) and a giant Adamantium Samurai Robot, is all kinds of radical. Jackman gets to flex his acting muscles thanks to a plot that allows this character to suffer a wide range of emotional dilemmas. Falling in love with Mariko, while still dealing with the punishing memories of Jean (who beckons him to ""come to her""), enduring his deteriorating physical state due to the multitude of wounds on his torso, addressing his mortality and acknowledging how vulnerable he now is, and having to face enormous obstacles. The scene where he must surgically remove his heart to return to his immortal state, while Yukio tries to fend off a determined Shingen, is a corker. Speaking of Yukio, she's a badass with that kendo stick and can go toe to toe with just about anybody. Yashida's role in the film is a fascinating development that has quite a twist by film's end. But, to quell any doubts of Wolverine's involvement in action, he gets plenty of henchmen to obliterate. Wolverine even gets to swear, which deters this Marvel Comic Book action flick from the possible viewing of little kiddies. Mariko and Logan's blossoming romance is actually not a detriment; in fact, it gives us a chance to see Wolverine humanizedhis aching and potential for a brand new love offers promise for a new lease on life. The credits leads to a scene that fuels anticipation for the next X-Men movie. This is far superior to the previous Wolverine film, and, despite the naysayers who claim this will be a disappointment, I am not alone in the endorsement of this movie...it has a vocal following of positive feedback."
"sreethered","8","34","69","16 December 2013"," Wolverine: A revival note for the franchise...
","James Mangold, director of 3:10 to Yuma, presented wolverine as a revival for the long dead x-men franchise. After the devastating display in X-men: Last stand, which was crucified by both fans and critics, for it's blind treatment that even killed it's principle characters, X-men series was struggling to hold on the screen. Two prequels were released, one as an origin story for wolverine and the other depicted the revelry between professor x and magneto. The new wolverine works as a sequel to x3, and tries to lead a path for the series in future. Taking place in Japan, Wolverine deals with the inner struggle of Logan, who grieves about the death of Jean Grey. He questions his eternity as a curse, and wanders around alone. A man, who Logan saved before a long time ago offers him a cure, which will make him mortal. Logan's decisions, and subsequent incidents makes the movie. Hugh Jackman, as usual with his signature role, shines. Supporting cast, including Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima and Will Yun Lee, does justice to their roles. Mangold, with his character-oriented approach, helped the movie to fall out from comic treatment. What lacks in Wolverine is it's explosive nature. The movie emphasize only on Logan. His grieve and his attempts to overcome it. No other characters, except Viper, is mutant here. That made the movie to look like a unique one in the franchise. Also, Wolverine leaves a number of loose ends, like what happened to the other mutants like Storm and Colossus. Let's see next year's X-men days future past answers them all....."
"yungbuffwan-468-315521","5","26","51","4 August 2013"," Wolverine Is At An All Time Low
","Okay, before I get into it, allow me to highlight some glitches in the movie. First, Wolverine, when in the Japanese prison camp (of which I'm pretty sure there were none in Nagasaki) says something to the effect of 'that's a B-52 bomber. no one's gonna outrun that.' Did he know about the project code named 'Big Boy?' Did he know that it was the atomic bomb? And if so, how the heck would he know that? Also, he slept with his friend's granddaughter. Isn't that against some unwritten code of honor? Also, almost the only factor in the entire movie that moved anybody even a little bit was his relationship with his Japanese friend, and how he sustained an atomic blast to protect him. Then, in the end, we came to find out that he was only looking to take advantage of Wolverine and reclaim his youth. Nicely done. Bonus: there were some funny parts, like in the porno hotel and with the 'doctor.. sort of. veterinarian.. student' and I'll admit, the beginning part with the bear was pretty sad and Wolverine's rage was pretty justified. And the train fight scene was awesome! However, this movie was just like that train, except way too slow paced at times, and it didn't know where it was going. Like, I'm pretty positive the director pulled the ending right out of his butt. Pretty bad. 5/10"

","Because of all the hype created around the film the expectations became high for the film but sorry to say movie was bad, not like SUPER BAD but was bad. After X-men: First class i thought some good work would be implemented on this film but the scenario remains same as ORIGINS. I call this movie bad because of the Boring pace of the film. The romance between Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) and Mariko(Tao Okamoto) was so not required but still it was present and to test the patience, was also given a large importance. We like Wolverine Cut through but not make love to. And the fight sequences were so exaggerated pre-release but they fall flat. Without giving out much i'll sum it up. Watch it if your a fan of X-men series and Wolverine else AVOID. Expecting something big from DAYS OF FUTURE PAST."
"namko-nguyen","7","18","34","30 July 2013"," The best WOLVERINE MOVIE so far
","Well, in my opinion I found this movie better than X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, but there were scenes where it would impress you as much as an average action movie that you'd watch just for distraction and fun. I like James Mangold as a director more than Gavin Hood in general, but I think Darren Aronofsky could've done it better.<br/><br/>I definitely liked the whole concept of the movie: Wolverine gets so sick of his immortality that he loses his purpose and there is nothing meaningful for him in his life anymore. But when he loses his rapid healing ability, he suddenly becomes more savage and more dangerous adversary than ever and after a long time he falls in love with a woman and has something worth fighting and living for.<br/><br/>Action scenes were very good but not perfect, it had some hilarious moments, but there weren't really very much scenes with a lot of emotions, the only affective scenes were: Jean Grey hallucinations and Logan's intimate moments with Mariko.<br/><br/>But the ending - finally the final battle Wolverine deserves with a REAL CHALLENGE and the mid-credits scene with Sentinels, Magneto and Xavier made me really excited about X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST."

","My preconceived thoughts, thanks only to the marketing, on The Wolverine involved me rolling my eyes. Yet, another Superhero/Comic Book part 2 (in this case, Wolverine's second solo feature) that our hero loses their powers, the very thing I go see these movies for. Yet another movie I had to count the minutes until the inevitable return of their abilities. Do writers even consider how unoriginal this concept is?<br/><br/>Hmmm how many have there been, excluding this one? And what were the reasons?<br/><br/>1. Iron Man 2 – Heart problems. <br/><br/>2. The Dark Knight – Wants to retire.<br/><br/>3. Spider-Man 2 – Anxiety. <br/><br/>4. Superman II – Lost for love. <br/><br/>5. Men in Black II – Amnesia. <br/><br/>6. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer – To each other. As some kind of comedy. Kinda.<br/><br/>But, I will say this: half way through this incredibly tedious, boring, terribly paced, toned down, un-fun, laughable dialogue and horribly choreographed ""action"" movie, I changed my opinion and actually wished my favorite X-Men character's (Wolverine) powers wouldn't return if this was how it was going to go.<br/><br/>I understand they wanted to make a more ""grown-up"" superhero movie, but still listing it as just that and keeping the PG-13, is a contradictionin this particular case. ""The"" Wolverine's really dark – he even drops the F-bomb in this, so if they truly wanted to make it more like an adult adaptation, ditch the too-low MPAA rating. Sadly, that wasn't the only problem the Director failed at.<br/><br/>The Walk the Line, Girl, Interrupted and Cop Land director, James Mangold, had absolutely no clue on how to make these characters the very least bit interesting, what makes action scenes – especially in the X-Men universe – exciting or flow right or understood the mythology behind ""the"" Wolverine character. Even Hugh Jackman, reprising his role for the sixth time, looked bored and ready to quit. I was, too – I almost took a break during this painstaking long movie and not even ask my friend what I missed upon returning.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't get me started on the storytelling from the characters. The endless, relentless and uninteresting childhood stories the characters stop the film every 5-10 minutes to tell us. I couldn't stop laughing when I mimicked the numerous ""When I was very young"" stories following the feature to my friend.<br/><br/>Basically, the preview gives away 85% of the movie, leaving very little surprises. ""The"" Wolverine is summoned to Japan to accept thanks for saving a man during World War II, but not just thanks: the gift of the death to ""the"" Wolverine's instant healing and eternal life ""curse."" So, when ""the"" Wolverine loses said power, he's shot multiples of times, including dead-center with a shotgun, and he continues on like they were scratches. <br/><br/>Will he get his powers back? Oh, gee. I dunno. Maybe. But, he will begin a chemistry-free love affair with a cardboard-cutout chick that had less depth of the width of said cardboard. <br/><br/>The movie was practically score-less, music-less, story-less and action-less. Along with the characters so incredibly dull, there was very little of interest here. And like I said, even Jackman looked uninterested and just going through the motions.<br/><br/>I wasn't a big fan of Iron Man 3 since it contained a minute amount of action, but at least that had a huge supply of comedy. Even ""the"" Wolverine's signature small one-liners seemed to be written by a three-year old and were so predictable, I quoted them (whispered out loud) before he said them during my initial viewing.<br/><br/>Oops, sorry: Initial? Probably: only."

The story has many holes, but maybe the worst are the complicated plan of Yashida to steal Logan's powers since Logan could have been killed while protecting Mariko (wouldn't be much easier to drug him in Yashida's house and bring him to the fortress to get his powers?), and Viper's motivation since it is not clear whether she is plotting the scheme for herself or for Yashida. But the movie entertains and does not disappoint at all. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Wolverine Immortal"" (""Immortal Wolverine"")"
"janianmol","10","16","30","27 July 2013"," Say hello to Wolvie!
","This summer, comic book fans and movie audiences have already been treated to two hit film adaptations featuring some of their favorite characters. In May, Marvel Studios' Iron Man 3 overcame a lukewarm fan reception to gross over $1 billion worldwide, proving that the Marvel Cinematic Universe remains one of the elite blockbuster franchises.<br/><br/>Then, Warner Bros. and DC released the Superman reboot Man of Steel and brought the Last Son of Krypton back triumphantly as that film has grossed $282 million domestically and $620 million worldwide.<br/><br/>Both of these movies also had an ""event"" feeling to them and with all the coverage the two blockbusters have received, it's easy to forget that there's still a third superhero movie this summer - and it's right around the corner: 20th Century Fox's The Wolverine. Although, i like to call it ""Wolvie"".<br/><br/>It's no secret that one of the most maligned superhero adaptations in recent memory is 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which was ravaged by critics and moviegoers who were displeased with the butchering of fan-favorite characters, sloppy production values, and a poor script. The general consensus was it was just a mess of a movie and an overall disappointment.<br/><br/>Looking for a reprieve, Fox has made the smart decision to distance the second Wolverine film from the first and position it as a standalone film - not a direct sequel. Since it takes place after the original X-Men trilogy, The Wolverine will still have to acknowledge the events of the prior movies (Jean Grey makes a brief appearance), but director James Mangold has made a point to explain that his movie ""stands alone"" and is about Wolverine's next journey. Serving as a quasi-reboot of sorts, The Wolverine's standalone approach will hopefully win the studio some audience goodwill.<br/><br/>James Mangold took over for Darren Aronofsky to direct The Wolverine and his involvement should be a positive sign. In the past, the filmmaker has helmed Oscar-nominated dramas such as the 2010 remake 3:10 to Yuma and the 2005 Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line. These two career highlights were praised for their acting and directing.<br/><br/>The director is hoping to craft a more personal, character-driven story that breaks from the mold of a typical summer action flick. Mangold is looking to respect the rich storytelling of comic books and graphic novels in and break away from what he calls the ""standard formula"" of a big-budget superhero adaptation. Obviously, there will still be action, but it should be refreshing to see a movie like this go in a different direction.<br/><br/>The best superhero films – The Dark Knight, Iron Man, Spider-Man 2, even The Incredibles – rely more on character than set pieces, making the person behind the mask (or in this case sideburns) just as interesting to watch as the action elements. If this is what Mangold is going for, it's a promising approach.<br/><br/>The Wolverine looks to deal with heavier issues than we're typically used to seeing in a film like this, particularly the consequences of immortality. This film finds Logan in a dark place as he struggles to cope with the knowledge that everyone he loves will eventually die while he stays alive. As a result, the movie will hopefully push our favorite mutant in new directions (as all great sequels should) and present audiences with something we've never seen before: a more physically vulnerable Wolverine.<br/><br/>At the turn of the 21st century, not many people knew who Hugh Jackman was, but a star-making turn in Bryan Singer's original X-Men in 2000 launched the Australian thespian's career. Jackman has since become one of the most recognizable actors of his time, scoring roles in acclaimed films such as The Prestige and Les Misérables. Still, his most iconic role is that of Wolverine in the X-Men franchise. Counting his brief cameo in 2011's X-Men: First Class, The Wolverine will mark the sixth time Jackman has portrayed the mutant, making him synonymous with the character. It's hard to see anyone else playing the part.<br/><br/>What makes Jackman such a great Wolverine (aside from his natural acting talent) is his enthusiasm for the material. It's obvious from his interview clips and quotes that he loves the character and the franchise. He understands how much the movies mean to the fans and he wants to give all of them a product they can enjoy.<br/><br/>Jackman is set to play the character once more in next year's X-Men: Days of Future Past. Eager to right past wrongs, fans have reason to think this movie will be a return to form if the star is so excited about it.<br/><br/>Even though The Wolverine is a standalone film, it was recently confirmed that there is a post-credits scene that teases where the studio intends to take the X-Men franchise - as they look to build a larger universe of X-Men films. This movie in particular may not be a launching pad for such a plan, but the prospect of a tease for the future is more than enough to generate interest among moviegoers, as Fox will quickly shift gears to next summer's ambitious X-Men Days of Future Past.<br/><br/>The Wolverine's button will provide us with that first look and it will be interesting, if nothing else, to see what directions they take.<br/><br/>Here's hoping Wolvie would do great on Box Office."
"bsingh_p","1","10","17","7 May 2015"," Completely Rubbish!
","The story was simple, with not much thought gone into it, with one- dimensional characters, again no thought even gone into the characters. Lazy writing everywhere. Also, every Japanese Man is made to look like a bad guy, including the grandfather, while the Japanese women are perfect.The father tries to kill his daughter and then the grandfather who was suppose to be the good guy in the beginning of the movie becomes the big pathetic crazy villain of the movie at the end. Oh yea, and her fiancé is evil too. Couldn't the director see how stupid this is, that the hero is a white guy and the rest of the non-white guys are villains. As if white guys are perfect for Japanese women or something.<br/><br/>The relationship with Wolverine and the Japanese woman is so empty and forced. Don't directors know anything about friendship and love, and how to portray that in a movie by slowing building that up. It's funny how they made her fiancé look bad for cheating on her when she did it herself with Wolverine, and Wolverine being a hypocrite gives him a moral lesson lol what a joke. Even Wolverine himself was completely one-dimensional compared to the animation cartoon I remember watching as a kid. They tried to show that he had learnt something by the end of the film and changed but what exactly did he learn, where was the character development?? Lazy writing.<br/><br/>Oh yea, and the part about him cutting himself open and going into his heart area was so stupid. He screams out in pain in every other scene, even when his claws get cut off but not in this scene especially when he's weakened due to the poison.<br/><br/>Another point, he's supposed to be wise, experienced especially in war tactics but he uses none of that in the whole movie, especially at the end when he battles those ninjas. They just show him like a dumb brute guy.<br/><br/>So many small pointless bits you can take out as well, like the viper lady shedding her skin for no reason. <br/><br/>The list can go on but I'll stop here."
"ironhorse_iv","7","10","17","1 August 2013"," Wolverine is a good movie, bub. It's cutting edge.
","I was very impress on how good the movie was really is. It wasn't as good as 2003's X2, but it was a lot better than 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Still, the movie doesn't match up with any of the previous films very well. That's why the plot holes were so big in the film in this film. We're talking about a franchise who continuity is very washy where it goes, where it came from and what it being present right now. It seem like FOX's Marvel team doesn't know how to handle the X-franchise properly. At less, Disney's Marvel kind of fix the loose-ends of the previous superheroes movies for 2011's Avengers release. I would love to see Marvel under one company sooner than later. Add, Columbia's Spiderman and any licensed Marvel that belong to other companies elsewhere. I don't care who own Marvel, as long as the films are good and make sense. With that, say, I was under the impression that he visit Japan storyline takes place prior to his joining the X-Men in the canon after WWI. Like the comic and the previous movie, he fought in Europe during WWII. So how was he in Japan in WWII? Plus, how does Logan even have memory of the event, if the previous film showed us he took a bullet to the head that made him forget everything that happened to him prior to his operation post-WW2? It wasn't that big of a deal, since I know the movie takes creative license, which is pretty OK in my book. At less, he goes back to Japan just after the Dark Phoenix saga, so this movie fits in with the comic pretty correct there. The Wolverine, is loosely based on Chris Claremont 1982 four-issue spin off comic series that sent Logan to Japan, for which Claremont drafted then-rising-superstar artist Frank Miller. The characters have the same name, but it's doesn't follow the comic book so well. It doesn't work as an adapted as the comic book, but as a movie of its own. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue, it's worth watching. After the events from 2006's X-Men Last Stand, Logan (Hugh Jackson) lives as a hermit in the Yukon, tormented by hallucinations memories of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Was Jean just a personification of Logan's guilt, or is it really phoenix in his head with him? Logan then finds himself being seek out by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who works for Shingen Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada) who wants to offers to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his father's body. Allowing Logan, a chance to live a normal life rather than being curse with immortality. Logan hating the fact that he outlive everybody he has once love, agrees. Logan set out for Japan, once there, he finds that something malicious is being case as Yashida's doctor, Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) plans to use it for a ultimate weapon call the Silver Samurai, a suit made out of Adamantium metal. Logan refused, but Viper weaken Logan's body to the point that the first time in Logan's life, he might die from the poisoning of Adamantium metal in his body. If not the poison, he might die due to the large numbers of Yakuza and Ninjas set out to kill him. In my opinion, the movie's plot could have been better. The movie's plot moves really slow, it's not well spread out, and last a lot of sub-plot got in the way with the main. I really couldn't find Logan falling in love with Yashida Clan member Mariko (Tao Okamoto). There was a lack of chemistry between Jackman and Tao, their characters were well written had the chemistry but the actors did bring that to life. I know, based on the comics, Logan likes Mariko, but in my opinion, I thought Yukio made a better love interest in this film. Better yet, why even have a love interest. It's seems like any female character put into a comic book film is there only for a love interest arch. I wish Mariko had more to offer the film. Mariko remained the useless princess stereotype. It felt like watching a superhero version of Karate Kiba, a martial-arts film starring Sonny Chiba, released in 1973. About Yukio, she is a mutant with the precognitive ability to know when someone will die. Her power wasn't needed. Nor does it makes any sense, in the case of Yashida and Logan toward the end. Fans may hate what they did for Silver Samurai. Silver Samurai look like Super Shredder in my opinion. FYI. The robotic Silver Samurai is in the new comics, so it does somewhat works. What doesn't work is Viper. The model actress is so awful in acting. Her scenes were so cartoony with all those hissing sounds. Was it really all that necessary to include Viper as a mutant, when she works much better as an Captain America villain. While Hugh Jackson did great as Logan. I just wish to see Logan learn more about the Japanese culture. In the comic, he was being trained in martial arts. In the film, he isn't doing anything new. He seem like a fish out of water there. Critics says the film is darken in tone, in my opinion, it wasn't. The action scenes were good. Bullet train scene was over the top, but it was short. Don't watch it in 3D, it was pretty useless .In a mid-credits scene, there is a scene worth watching hyping X-Men: Days of Future Past. Overall: If you're watching it as an action flick, yes it's a good movie. If you're a fan of the Wolverine character and actually know something about this storyline, you'll be quite disappointed, just like the last X-Men. Still, it's fun to watch."

","Frankly, I am at a loss for words because James Mangold has managed to follow up Knight And Day with a movie which is even worse. Hats of the you sir because only you could fail so spectacularly TWICE. I would start praying if it led to you NEVER again attempting to direct an action movie. Mr. Manglod if you keep giving us movies like these we will forget that Walk The Line was also your creation.<br/><br/>Blessed with the ""most original"" title in a long time, this movie is a colossal waste of time and money. The screenplay is written by two twelve year olds, who feel that it is important to resort to corny dialogue so that the audience don't forget that it is a superhero movie after all. The writers are so enamoured by Japanese tradition that they consider it to their right to introduce audience to the way the chopsticks are to be used and the kimono is to be worn.<br/><br/>Jackman is the only thing that keeps this movie together. Other actors including Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukushima are average but considering that it is their first movie their performance is not too bad. Svetlana Khodchenkov (I know the name sounds impressive) is truly terrible. The ""so called twist"" is as predictable as the outcome of Judd Apatow movies. I would have given this movie nada had it not been for a truly sensational Bullet Train sequence.<br/><br/>Pranit's Rating: 1/10"

","This movie was excellent but in some parts I found myself craving more intense action even the fight between The Silver Samurai and Wolverine seemed really long and boring except for when he cut off his claws. The twist in the end was surprising but a lot of people had predicted it far before the scene came. Viper's presence in this movie was not only pointless but boring she could've done more than just poison a couple of guys and walk away with a name like Viper I expect a fast striking, dangerous, venomous character all we got was venomous. Overall action junkies like me might not have enjoyed the lack of action but the movie itself is gold."

You just cant relate to the total unnecessary love angle introduced in the movie and as soon as the girl make appearance, movie standard just plummets. Story becomes too slow for a wolverine movie. Awful script writing. Why they brought this stupid love angle in the movie is totally beyond me.

","This 'X-Men' film concentrates solely on the Wolverine; there are other mutants but not those who featured in the previous films (excluding the late Jean Grey who appears in dream sequences). It opens in a prisoner of war camp just outside Nagasaki in 1945 when Logan saves the life of a Japanese officer, Ichiro Yashida, who had freed allied prisoners just before the bomb was dropped. In the present Logan is living in the Yukon wilderness where he is tracked down by Yukio, a fellow mutant with the power to foretell others' deaths, she has been hired by Yashida to take Logan to Tokyo so he can thank him before he dies. Once in Japan he learns that Yashida has other ideas; he intends to take Logan's immortality for himself! Before he can do anything he dies and at his funeral members of the Yakuza attempt to kidnap his granddaughter Mariko. Logan and Mariko go on the run, chased by a variety of thugs. He doesn't realise that Yashida's doctor, the mutant 'Viper', has done something to him; he no longer heals how he did before. This means that for the first time Logan is in real danger. Before the film is over he will have to discover who wants Mariko and why as well as confront many more foes.<br/><br/>Those expecting lots different mutants with varied superpowers may be disappointed by this; however those who want a solid story and plenty of action should enjoy it. Hugh Jackman is great in the role of Wolverine and the Japanese setting provides a great excuse for him to use his claws against enemies who wield blades of their own. That isn't the only action though; he also has to deal with being gun toting Yakuza and ninjas who put so many arrows in him he could have changed his name to 'The Porcupine'! Some of the action, such as the fight on the roof of a speeding bullet train, is a bit over the top but that suits the genre. Jackman is ably supported by Tao Okamoto, as Mariko; Rila Fukushima, as Yukio; and Svetlana Khodchenkova who plays the Viper. The Viper, a mutant who produces a variety of deadly poisons is a pretty good villain. The film's main weakness is the final battle when Logan must fight a giant robot Samurai; it is exciting enough but doesn't fit in that well with the action that has gone before. The Japanese setting adds to the film with a good variety of locations including the vibrancy of modern Tokyo and the beauty of the coastal landscape one could almost think the Japanese Tourist Board suggested the locations! Overall I'd recommend this for those looking for plenty of action without the unpleasantness that would have earned a less child-friendly rating."

","Prologue:<br/><br/>With ""The Wolverine"" in theaters, what better time is there to look back on Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the character? He gave life to his first appearance as Wolverine in 2000's ""X-Men."" Now, he's on his sixth appearance in a movie as Logan. Hugh Jackman's outing as the clawed superhero is a better improvement over its predecessor X-Men Origins: Wolverine but doesn't have the charm of neither Bryan Singer's X-Men and X2 nor Mathew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class.<br/><br/>Plot Analysis:<br/><br/>The film unfolds from the after events of X-Men: The Last Stand – a wandering Logan living amidst a quiet life in the wild, tormented by hallucinations of loss of his lost love Jean Grey, giving him nightmares and questioning his existence but also of his time as a prisoner in Nagasaki during World War II. Logan meets a redhead woman, Yukio, who takes him to Japan to meet her boss, Yashida, a Japanese tech giant who is lying on his deathbed (a tech wonder) wishes to say thanks to Logan for saving him from the Fat man nuclear bomb during him time as a soldier in Nagasaki.<br/><br/>Yashida offers Logan to make him mortal, to feel what it's like to grow old, lead a normal life and a theoretically meaningful death. Logan refuses his offer and finds himself in the middle of family politics, protecting Yashida's granddaughter Mariko from a black ninja clan group 'Yakuza', followed by a few random action sequences, multiple disembowelment, and a ninja attack in the night, a funny feud on the roof of a bullet train speeding at 300 mph (seriously?). So far quiet good but the bland love story between Mariko and Logan - give me a break!<br/><br/>Viper, a mutant biologist injects a parasite to Logan, making him vulnerable to bullet shots and gives a taste of what it's like to feel pain, bleed, lose his healing ability and weaken his strength. Logan later operates himself and gets rid of Viper's parasite restoring his healing power. Casting of Viper was such a waste; guess the Director was confused whether or not to portray Viper who appears in only four scenes.<br/><br/>The casting of the ninja head Harada was just OK, it could've been better. The story concludes to the climax with a fight between Logan and the Silver Samurai, a giant robot built with adamantium, revealed to be Yashida who faked his death and extracts Logan's ability to heal and leaves Logan with bone claws, who eventually defeats Yashida. The fight feels silly but passable; at least it didn't end up in ripping apart places. Logan's exposure to nuclear radiation and the instant healing in CGI is good.<br/><br/>And wait for the post-credits scene, two years later at an airport Logan sees an ad about TRASK industries, he is encountered by Magneto (Ian Mckellen) now with his restored power, who warns him about a powerful force threatening to end mutant kind and to his shock sees Prof. X (Patrick Stewart) alive. This leaves the audience with few questions, Prof. X's survival? and Magneto's power restoration? With Peter Dinklage's (GOT fame) casting as Bolivar Trask into Singer's X- Men: Days of the Future Past, one can expect a decent flick in 2014.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>An eccentric storyline set in Japan, presence of only two mutants, makes Mangold's Wolverine a distinctive flick from those typical X-Men movies, sets itself as a standalone movie. A mild script, oddly shot action sequences, sloppy screenplay, it's just good enough but not great. You don't need to have seen the previous five films in which Hugh has starred as the brawny mutant, Logan. It's pretty tough to point out a fierce quote of the Wolverine's as they were from the previous movies, this one shall do ""You wanted me to say goodbye to you personally? Well Sayonara!"" Hugh looks more fearsome than ever and delivers good performance with ease. Be sure that you don't miss him. Go for 2D not 3D.<br/><br/>A generous 6 out of 10."

","It is August 9th 1945, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is in Nagasaki, Japan, as the U.S. drops the bomb on Nagasaki, as most of the soldiers commit hara kiri, Logan saves one soldier, named Yashida (Ken Yamamoura) and Yashida is eternally grateful.<br/><br/>Years later, a girl named Yukio (Rila Fukushima) invites Logan to Japan to visit Yashida. Yukio is a mutant as well, with the power to see the future. Logan accepts the visit, and visits Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) who by now is an aging tech giant, worth billions, but also dying from the radiation he was exposed to during the war. Yashida is being treated by a shady doctor,(Svetlana Khodchenkova) who he calls his oncologist, but is mixing up chemicals much more complex to keep Yashida alive. Yashida makes a promise to Logan, he will give Logan what he desires most a mortal life, if Logan promises to protect his granddaughter, Mariko, (Tao Okamoto) from the Yakuza, the Japanese mob. Does Logan agree to protect Mariko? Who is Yashida's mysterious doctor? Does Logan get his mortality back from Yashida's mysterious doctor?<br/><br/>I have very mixed feelings about The Woverine. I wanted to like it a lot, because I really love the X-Men trilogy and even the first Wolverine movie. But it is precisely because of the X-Men movies that I feel like the Wolverine falls short. The X-Men movies were about large issues, the discovery of mutants, their impact on the world, and the human reaction to the mutants. This story feels smaller in scope and impact. And the substitute for story is gratuitous violence, and I'm not talking about comic book violence, people get shot and stabbed and right and that is disturbing. The story feels almost provincial, being shot mostly in Japan, and the cynical side of me says that was done to draw on the large Asian audience both in the U.S. and worldwide. There is a romance between Logan and Mariko, that seems forced, maybe because Jackman s 44, and Tao Okamoto is 28. A lot of the script is not worth the paper it's written on.<br/><br/>There are strong points to the story though. Jackman does a wonderful job reprising Logan, as a haunted soul, disturbed by nightmares and yearning for a ""normal"" life. Famke Janssen is superb reprising her role as Jean Grey, she is a siren, a specter, calling to Logan to join her in eternal rest. Rilla Fukushima, brings some fun and action to the movie as Logan's ""bodyguard."" The rest of the cast pretty much falls flat. The character played by Svetlana Khodchenkova could have been an interesting one, with a little more development, but they didn't do that.<br/><br/>There is one action scene that deserves mention, it is when Logan is fighting one of the Yakuza on top of a speeding bullet train, the rest of the action scenes are pretty violent, and largely unnecessary. The Wolverine clocks in at 126 minutes and could have used a lot of editing, but there is a tease for the third Wolverine movie, after the credits, and that looks worth watching, so stay until after the credits.<br/><br/>The Wolverine: A cat with no claws.<br/><br/>for more movie reviews, check out my blog reviewswithatude@wordpress.com"
"superman-750-466892","5","19","38","28 July 2013"," Scratches with claws but lacks bite
","The Wolverine' is released in UK cinemas today in Hugh Jackman's fifth outing as the super-healing adamantium filled mutant super-hero. Set, very loosely I might add, after the events of X-Men 3 we see the Wolverine yet again as a lone wolf trying to find himself. He heads to Japan where in a previous World War II visit he did a little bit of hero work and saved a Japanese soldier from a rather large nuclear explosion.<br/><br/>Back in the present day the previously mentioned Japanese soldier is now rather old, grateful and seriously rich and powerful. As any mental billionaire would he has taken quite a keen interest in Logan's super mutanty healing ability. The sort of interest any mega rich dying man would take in a guy who can heal himself quickly and live rather a long time.<br/><br/>So basically an old rich guy who Logan once saved wants to steal his healing ability. That's the tall, short and depth of this film. The film also sees a brief return for Jean Grey, but only in Logan's mind. The films a journey for 'The Wolverine' to find and forgive himself after killing Jean and leaving the X-Men far behind.<br/><br/>Wolverine is easily the most interesting of the X-Men characters (just ahead of magneto) and probably the reason he has spawned what are now two spin-off films. Logan has lived a long time due to his ability to heal, so he has seen and done a fair bit that can be explored in films. See what I wrote there, he can heal. He is not, as this film states, immortal. This is the first of very many problems this film has. I'm quite sure it was written by someone who has no grasp of the character at all. Logan can heal, he can't however live forever. If he could live forever he wouldn't get any older looking and would be a man-baby with very annoying baby claws.<br/><br/>My second problem with the film is the fact that its rubbish. It's basically a Japanese government funded film about how great Japan is and how it looks at its past and embraces its future. Yet again there are no, and I do mean no, decent action scenes in the entire movie that are not in the trailer. It's basically 3 minutes of action dragged out into nearly two hours. There must be a total of 6 minutes combined screen time for the films entire tepid and boring bad guys. It's woefully short of any serious or major bad guy catalyst and this is one of the main reasons for its general crappyness. Even the weirdly weird looking good girl Yukio, played by Rila Fukushima, is underused in a film that offers very little new action.<br/><br/>The what I shall sarcastically call 'epic showdown' at the end is nothing more than what's on the trailer mixed with sheer predictability. The only interest I took any interest is when yet again i found myself wondering why the writers failed to take into account the Wolverines actual powers. This is a running theme in the movie where they forget that 'The Wolverine' has an adamantium (a very rare super strong metal) skeleton. Basically he has a Terminator undercarriage so shoving bullets, knives and swords into him wouldn't go in very far in unless you went in through the stomach.<br/><br/>The only reason Logan can tolerate the adamantium skeleton and not get metal toxicity is the fact that he is a super healer. When stripped of his healing powers he would die very suddenly, or at the very least feel the effects. They also forgot that retracting and showing his claws would mean them ripping through his skin and leaving him in agony, as seen previously. The end of the film has Logan losing the visible part of his claws, and being left with adamantium stumps. Then suddenly the writers forget about the adamantium claw stumps and he was back having his re-grown boney claws again. So he grew bone around a metal claw stamp. Obviously Logan's Wolverine abilities now involve growing back bone claws around indestructible metal in mere seconds.<br/><br/>When you have had Man Of Steel recently with its varied and new type action sequences this film just seems like turgid drivel. It offers nothing new action wise with Logan throwing his claws about in a boringly routine, as seen before manner. The only glimmer of hope was that there is a very interesting after end-credits scene. Not worth sitting through 'The Wolverine' movie for I might add, but interesting none the less.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen any of the trailers, TV clips or ads you may find this a tolerable watch. If you have then you have seen it all. Hollywood clips have ruined yet another film and I can tell you not to bother. Watch the trailer and save yourself time and money.<br/><br/>Turgid, lazy storytelling, a failure to grasp the characters abilities and lacking in bad-guy screen time. Very, very disappointing."
"sohansurag","7","21","43","24 December 2013"," Back to Basics!
","Wolverine is one of the iconic characters in both the Marvel Universe as well as the 20th Century Fox's movies; so is his Adamantium claws and healing factor. An immortal and living through ages he does have a lot of stories ready to be told through movies/comics. We did get an Origin movie, X-Men Origins Wolverine which was panned by critics and audiences alike. But I felt it was trashed more than it deserved to be. It had loads of action and bits from the original Wolverine Origin story arc but it did trash the character for the sake of being an action-heavy summer blockbuster. A weak script, irrelevant characters and a stupid take on 'the merc with a mouth' underwhelmed the audiences. Anyways The Wolverine salvages some of its lost prestige putting a lot of focus on the core character.<br/><br/>Rumors that Darren Aronofsky'd be helming the new Wolverine had me excited but the director's chair was handed over to James Mangold in the end. I am not skeptic at all regarding Mangold's directing prowess, as evident from gems like 3:10 to Yuma, Walk the line and Identity. But I was wondering how he'd handle a superhero flick. After watching it, its safe to say Mangold's direction is far better than what I'd expected it to be.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is undoubtedly based on Frank Miller's take on the superhero and I was already familiar with the names Mariko, Shingen and Yukio. It all came like a whiff of fresh air. The Wolverine is sort of a reboot for the series and a brilliant stepping stone for a new franchise which could tell a parallel story to the X-Men movies. Although it has its roots attached to the previous flicks, we are dropped into the midst of Wolverine's story. There ain't no origin, there ain't no 'Previously'; instead we are just dropped into a narrative which ploughs forward to the thick of Japan. The Wolverine could be compared to treatment our superheros been getting recently. He's been stripped off his healing factors and he is left like so almost the entire movie and it does bring out some tension. I mean when he had the healing power, we knew he wouldn't just die even if she's split into two (admit it!)<br/><br/>The Wolverine is directed well and so was it well written and the action sequences well choreographed but its not without its flaws though. As mentioned above The Wolverine still has the debris it's carried on from X-Men The Last Stand and I wasn't pleased with it. Wolverine has flashbacks of his lost love? Seriously? Isn't it time his healing factor took care of that already? I mean its the god-damn Wolvie we're talking about here. Jean Grey's flashbacks (more like boring nightmares and more than once) kept crawling into the plot disrupting the pace and I just didn't like it. Of course Wolverine is tormented from what he'd done in the past but that doesn't mean, we the audience need to be tormented from start to end. The Japan setting was a bit distracting as well and maybe thats a personal thing. I am not a big fan of Martial arts movies and there was an excess of martial arts settings and jargon here in the movie though it all did look good. Props were fantastic and the action sequences thick, especially the Bullet Train sequence is something to gape at.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman effortlessly steps into his Wolverine shoes for the 6th time and having worked with Mangold in Kate & Leopold did wonders for The Wolverine. This is the Logan we've all praised and been used to and Hugh easily slides into the role and storyline straight from X-Men The Last Stand albeit forgetting X-Men Origins Wolverine. But then again playing Wolverine would have become second instinct for Hugh by now. Supporting cast couldn't be praised for the same, most of them being just bait for the plot. Especially Wolverine love interest in the movies, I felt they had absolutely no chemistry. Rila Fukushima did an absolutely splendid job playing Yukio. I had huge expectations for Svetlana Khodchenkova who played the only other mutant in the movie, Viper but she just served for some eyecandy and wasn't even fleshed up to be a proper antagonist.<br/><br/>For what its worth, The Wolverine is a splendid action movie which concentrates more on the character and the plot than heavy heavy action sequences. If you are an X-Men/Wolverine fan you are gonna love it and please do stay back after the credits coz there is a monumental end- credit to be seen there."

","Despite the third act being drastically different in tone to the previous two acts (but it's still fun and enjoyable), The Wolverine is an incredible spin-off that's thrilling and emotional, showing the effects of the events of X-Men 3 on Wolverine/Logan. Hugh Jackman gives a reliably incredible performance as Wolverine once again. Hiroyuki Sanada and Rila Fukushima both give great supporting performances. James Mangold's direction is great and the action sequences are fantastic. The music by Marco Beltrami is really good."

","The second of Wolverine's standalone movies, The Wolverine sees Logan (Hugh Jackman) travelling to Tokyo where dying businessman Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) would like to say goodbye to the man who saved his life during WWII. While in Japan, Logan becomes embroiled in a battle for control of Yashida's empire, and must protect the life of the businessman's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto).<br/><br/>The Wolverine is far from the best of the X-Men movies - the plot isn't strong enough to sustain the 126 minute runtime and is riddled with holes - but Jackman is always great, and any film with ninjas is cool in my book. The film also features one of the silliest action scenes of the franchise - a battle between Logan and the yakuza on the roof of a speeding Bullet train - which, despite its preposterousness, is still entertaining, AND it's got a fight against a giant adamantium samurai robot with a flaming sword, which must count for something.<br/><br/>My advice: sit back, switch off your brain, and enjoy the spectacle, safe in the knowledge that the next Wolverine movie, Logan (2017), is reputedly much, much better."

This is definitely underrated and what I call a slow burner. The worst of the bunch imo is Origins, X3 and Apocalypse.

"omarh92","4","14","27","17 August 2013"," Terrible, an embarrassment to the actual Wolverine
","MINOR SPOILERS CONTAINED! NOT MAJOR PLOT CHANGING SPOILERS!<br/><br/>It surprises me that Wolverine fans enjoyed this movie, which means these are fans that were made from the movies and not comic books or cartoons. If you've seen the past X-Men movies, this movie is utter embarrassment in front of X-men and X-Men 2. Throughout the series, plot holes appear from nowhere making the word sense not a word in the dictionary anymore. <br/><br/>This contains MINOR SPOILERS, which will not give away the very main plot.<br/><br/>The plot in this movie is quite poor. It is all action an effects again. Logan is on a runaway journey after the events from 'X-Men 3: The Last Stand', he is disturbed and depressed. He then gets himself into some trouble, this is basically it. We see someone refereed as ""Viper,"" who is actual MADAM HYDRA from the comics, once again a known character has been tampered, changed, and ended up looking terrible. For those hyped for the Silver Samurai, prepared to be disappointed, as he is only in the last 10 - 20 minutes of the movie. Prepare to be even more disappointed that Silver Samurai is A ROBOT, and not a man in an actual samurai armor, but a man in a giant robot. <br/><br/>This movie is also rich in plot holes. One plot hole in particular really annoyed me. Now we all know when Wolverine unleashes his claws, it cuts the skin between his knuckles but get regenerated thanks to his advanced healing factor. Now in the movie, Wolverine loses his healing factor, he'll get shot and stabbed and be wounded with band-aids and antiseptic. However, he still unleashes his claws in a fight, so theoretically he's suppose to bleed endlessly once the claws come out because THE SKIN IS CUT, yet in the movie he brings them out and puts them in like old times with his healing factor, which HE LOST in this movie, temporarily of course. Note, in X-Men 1 near the beginning of the movie, Rogue asks Wolverine if it pains when the claws come out, and Wolverine replied that it always hurts but the wound gets healed very fast.<br/><br/>This poor plot movie is masked with some okay action sequences, and lame comical humor (there are few funny ones), can be compared to Michael Bay's Transformers or James Cameron's Avatar, all action and graphics yet no or a very bad story. This movie is an insult to fans of the character.<br/><br/>There is an after-credit of the movie which honestly is better than the entire film. It's a lead up to X-Men: Days Of Future Past (2014). 'The Wolverine' was terrible, end of review."

To me Japan really is a beautiful country, that is rarely seen in comic book films, and made for very interesting fight scenes and theme to the story arc overall. <br/><br/>The story was also well done in part as I mentioned before to the unique setting, as well as some of the characters like the mutant Reptile.It also plays around with the very core of Wolverine's mutant powers, and takes it in a very interesting direction that keeps fans on the edge of their seat throughout the movie. <br/><br/>My only very minor disappointment was in a part of the ending which was slightly predictable.

The end credit scene has left me feeling really excited for ""Day's of Future past"" and I cant wait for the 23rd of May 2014 to see that.<br/><br/>10/10 Thanks for reading :)"

","Some time after the events of The Last Stand, this sequel of sorts focuses on Logan/Wolverine as a tortured soul living in isolation and haunted by vivid memories of his lost love. Now, having reached an emotional impasse, he travels to Japan to visit an old comrade. Once there, he quickly gets caught up in a complex political power struggle that, for the first time in his life, makes him truly vulnerable. Jackman, not unexpectedly, is formidable in the lead, and there are lots of visceral action scenes, but that does little to compensate for the faults; film's tone is grim, its characters—sans Jackman—are unappealing, plotting is convoluted, subject matter turns ugly, and the pace lags heavily after a strong start. Jackman effectively spits, scowls, snarls, and flexes his muscles in what has become his go-to role, but he has almost no support; too long, too dark, and too serious to really be fun. **"

","It's like they didn't watched the movie before releasing it. <br/><br/>There's no explanation for Viper's motives, and why did she change her skin in the middle of a fight scene, which didn't made her stronger at all. It made no sense. <br/><br/>They should be a lot clearer in let us know the time line. After searching Google, I found out this is after the third movie, X-Men: Last Stand. Wolverine has a lot of dreams/hallucinations about Jean. They should have started the movie with a scene right after the ending of Last Stand, so the audience would get a clearer picture of what was going on. Not just a scene where he wakes up in the woods after ?? years after a war.<br/><br/>Also when Wolverine's powers was disabled, he took a lot of bullets and jumped from a high building, but he just kept on running like it didn't hurt him at all. <br/><br/>Plot holes and an overall boring move makes me give this movie a 2/10"
"assman200","Null","15","30","25 August 2013"," Hugh Jackman is the PERFECT Wolverine. GREAT film!
","The Wolverine is a movie that manages to carve a smarter, fresher niche in the genre that Fox has had trouble reaching before now. It's a wonderful character study first and a great adventure film second. I applaud this smarter approach.<br/><br/>In this film we finally get to see the depth of character that makes Logan one of Marvel's best all-around anti-heroes. I'm not one of those crybabies that hated the Origins movie but I always felt they could have done better with the character. Wolverine deserves better than any ""7/10 not bad"" movie. Well, Logan FINALLY gets a high caliber pay off with this film.<br/><br/>A true movie first, Wolverine is the most entertaining film of the summer season because it plays it just right. It didn't try to jump on the dark film bandwagon just for the sake of playing with grim emotions. The balance and depth it finds makes it a special film and what results was a true joy to watch on its own. Honestly, other releases this summer have disappointed because they couldn't deliver intelligence or heart with their characters. Wolverine should have patrons intrigued and enthused as they savor a movie done right. It's a perfect balance of intensity, pathos and action. It's the story that only Logan in Japan could deliver and it's as close as we've seen to getting the Logan from the books.<br/><br/>I don't expect any movie version to become the literary version because you really can't compete with 40 years of character development and you also can't make any movie figure an unstoppable killing machine. Yet, they come very close. As a fan, I did have a problem with the character's power level in the movie franchise. He seemed to get KO'd so easily in the trilogy. Sabretooth KO'd him (for hours?) with one swing from a tree branch. Magneto KO'd him on the train by slamming him in to the back wall. Also, a single regular (non-adamantium) bullet to the forehead sends him down in X2. They make Logan tougher and formidable in this film yet they flip it all and make him vulnerable. This adds texture and ups the stakes. Thus, it makes the film so much more intense and enjoyable. Hugh Jackman is the PERFECT Wolverine and now maybe certain fanboys will be forced to acknowledge just that fact. For those of us that already enjoyed his work, this film is a special treat because it's the best the character has ever looked and been portrayed in live action."
"AlenkaArya","9","17","35","31 July 2013"," The Wolverine is back!
","PLOT Logan (Hugh Jackman) lives as loner while he's still devastated and haunted by events that happened with Jean Grey in the third film of X- Men. He is found by a Japanese woman Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who delivers him a message from a man he rescued in 1945, called Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada). He is dying of cancer an would like to met Logan for the last time. Wolverine travels to Japan, meets Yashida's son Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada) and granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) but soon realise that a county of samurai, ninjas and yakuza are very much real.<br/><br/>REVIEW First of all, I'm a huge X-Men and Wolverine fan so let me get that straight. This film is really focused on Logan's character so consequently the movie is a character study first. If you expect mindless action you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Many fans were quite stroppy after the first Wolverine's film years back so this one is in a way a redemption. The reason lies in staying true to the comic's original panels although the story lines have been shifted and shuffled. Some fans are saying this superhero film is one of the best comic based movies but it's clear that you can never satisfy everyone.<br/><br/>As I said before, Wolverine explores his inner conflicts, tries to distance himself from the rest of the X-Men, while facing immortality and soul searching. Hugh Jackman again delivers reprising Logan. His performance is strong and most supporting cast does a wonderful job as well. Setting is beautiful and it was so refreshing to see the traditional Japanese culture and non-Hollywood cast. Many films take place in some country but then we only see Americans in it.<br/><br/>Action. To be honest, I expected more action-fighting scenes that would make more sense. Some of them felt a bit forced to me (for example when Yukio and Shingen fight). I understand that they wanted to include scenes because of film's dynamics but still.<br/><br/>Sadly the writing is very two-dimensional for everyone other than Logan. I get that main focus is on Wolvie but other characters are underdeveloped yet there is so much potential for characters like Yukio, Kenuichio and Viper. Story could interlace in a more sophisticated way yet I can imagine how hard it is to adapt a story like this. I love the fact that women in the film are portrayed as strong but I wish there would be more to their stories. I also enjoyed a bit darker mood of the film, Jean Grey's appearances and occasionally humorous scenes.<br/><br/>Main three thoughts that I got from watching The Wolverine: 1. he's freakin awesome (hands down to Hugh!); 2. I would like to see Logan and Yukio travel and kick some ass together; 3. aaaaaaaaa, can't wait for next year's X-Men: Days of Future Past!<br/><br/>P.S. Watch out for he post-credits scene in the end.<br/><br/>http://somewhereibelong-arya.blogspot.com/2013/07/movie-review- wolverine-2013.html"

","I never understand why these movie makers think they can write a better story then the comic books. Read Frank Miller's Wolverine and then u can experience a true Wolverine story. Now to the so called movie. With so many plot holes, this is a terrible movie. <br/><br/>(Spoilers) Why the hell is it called Wolverine? The whole movie is about Logan. Also how does the old man or any of the Japanese know the name Wolverine? The old man only knows Logan from the past. The old man spent billions of the company's money so why is the company still powerful? The old man waits until his death bed to find Logan? Logan can smell poisons and whatever but he drinks a cup full of it? Logan is completely knocked out but the bad guys wait until he wakes up to do bad things to him? Logan lets himself get shot with arrows attached to ropes, when he can easily cut them off with his claws? The old man builds a 10 foot samurai suit that keeps him alive? Not going to touch that one. The Japanese in the movie talk about honor, but none of them had any. Mariko sleeps with Logan, everyone betrays each other? When Logan loses his healing factor, the metal poisoning would of killed him. Also Logan should if tired all the time carrying the extra weight of the metal in his body. Logan smells poison on the arrow that killed the bear but didn't know who the shooter(s) were? Again Logan has extra strong senses and would of been able to smell the shooter(s) right away. There were probably many more mistakes but I'm too tired to type anymore. Overall, just a terrible movie and a very terrible comic book movie."

","THE WOLVERINE is a second spin off from the X-MEN franchise centred around Hugh Jackman's titular character. The first, X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE was a distinctly average viewing experience, although this one's a little better. It's not the stuff of greatness, but it has novelty value which makes it more entertaining than others I've seen.<br/><br/>The story in a nutshell is Wolverine in Japan. The good news is that this allows a cast of Japanese supporting actors to shine, although most of them have very thin characters that seem based on cliché rather than experience. There's the damsel-in-distress, the evil black sheep family member, the old man obsessed with immortality. However, I was delighted to see Hiroyuki Sanada in a Hollywood film again (even though he's once more given a one-dimensional role, just like in RUSH HOUR 3) and surprised to notice Hal Yamanouchi (star of ENDGAME and a dozen other trashy Italian sci-fi flicks of the 1980s) in a pivotal role.<br/><br/>The film's execution is fine, although the story is never quite as thrilling or expertly-made as I'd been led to believe. It's Jackman and his love interest against various competing bad guys. Jackman is bulked up but his acting is on autopilot. There's a ton of bloodless action scenes, and they do feel a little grittier than in the usual superhero outing, although the train set-piece has the same about of cheesy CGI as in the Thai flick VENGEANCE OF AN ASSASSIN. THE WOLVERINE does the job, and if you're a huge X-Men fan you might like it more. Me, I lightly enjoyed it, but it's not something I'd be in a hurry to watch again."

","So, after 'X-Men' and 'X2', the X-Men series was doing very well. Then, they came out with 'X-Men: The Last Stand', which the general audiences did not care for. After that, there was 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', which audiences didn't care for, either. In 2011, the X-Men series was brought back to life with 'X-Men: First Class'. That was movie was reviewed well by general audiences. Now, after the two X-Men prequels, we have a sequel to 'X-Men: The Last Stand'.<br/><br/>'The Wolverine' stars Hugh Jackman, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Svetlana Khodchenkova. Hugh Jackman is of course great in this film, like he always has been as wolverine. The wolverine is Hugh Jackman. He nails the role in every way. The rest of the cast and the supporting cast also do very well. I had no doubt that any of them were who they portrayed in their role. Svetlana Kohchenkova did really well as the main antagonist in the film. She had that ""bad guy"" feeling that went along with her the whole time. The only problem I have with the acting is that some of the actors overacted their role. They brought the acting too far and it was over the top.<br/><br/>The story was also good. It had a clear conflict, adventure, and task at hand for most of the time. When it got to then, it wasn't like that, but the end was only a little part of the film. For most of the film there are certain reasons characters fight, and what they fight for. They have their motivations and their weaknesses. The characters were all very rich. They didn't need to do much character development on wolverine because we know who he is, but they let us know what he is like now. It also developed the other characters well and gave them back stories. 'The Wolverine' was not all about wolverine. It was about the situation at hand and many of the characters. It was still focused, but it didn't stay on one thing the whole time.<br/><br/>The writing for the movie made it seem more realistic, and gave the characters more depth. It helped us know them better and care about them more. Sometimes it got a little unrealistic and illogical to the characters, but at the beginning of the film it made the characters what they were. Sometimes the dialog was clichéd, like when characters had situations and were in trouble, but for the mood of the movie, it would be hard not to cliché the dialog. There was one thing in this action film that really separated it from most acting movies. In most action films, the antagonist always loses because they talk to the protagonist and tell them their plan. In this film, there's not very much of that. The antagonist doesn't talk too much. I liked how an action film pulled that off.<br/><br/>The action sequences in 'The Wolverine' were excellent. They mixed the right amount of emotion and intensity into the action scenes that balance out into very big fighting scenes that seem like they should mean something big to the film. There was one sequence that I thought got old and didn't really make sense at some points, but it was still good.<br/><br/>The slow scenes after a big action sequences were done well. They were there to show the change in the characters, so they weren't that boring. Yes, they weren't incredibly entertaining, but they were still good. This film captures the emotions of you and puts them into the prolonging intensity of the situations at hand. This film has done this better than any other action film I've ever seen. There was also a very big twist at the end that I would've never guessed. It did get the smallest bit over the top, but it still worked very well.<br/><br/>My only other problem with the film is that it seems like it ends several times.<br/><br/>So, amazing battle scenes, great acting, very well done, very rich characters, good writing, it captures your emotions, and has good slow scenes, but has some unrealistic things, sometimes the acting and events of the movie get a bit over the top, and it seems like it ends several times. 'The Wolverine' is not perfect, but is excellent. I will definitely buy this movie on Blu-Ray and DVD when it comes out and highly recommend it to anything who is thinking about going to see it."
"marvelmanny","Null","11","21","28 July 2013"," Hugh Jackman is Wolverine.
","And this movie proves it. Anybody who says otherwise doesn't know Wolverine. I don't think you could have found an actor who is as passionate for the role as Hugh Jackman is. And that comes across with his physique. I mean he put on 24 pounds of muscle for Gosh sakes! And in this movie he is big-really big. He even produced this film. His intensity and berserker rage is unmatched. Plus he adds compassion. He's not just a tough guy, but plays a very human character. I think that is what gave the X-Men series longevity and made it so lucrative. Hugh Jackman. And I believe my statement to be true since Wolverine is the main character in all of the X-Men films.<br/><br/>Just a little tid bit. They were originally going to get Russell Crowe as Wolverine for the original X-Men film. I'm not saying it's good. I'm not saying it's bad, but I thank God Fox gave a fairly unknown actor an opportunity.<br/><br/>The film starts out well. Wolverine has made himself an outcast- living off the land. He hasn't really gotten over killing Jean Grey, since he has nightmares about her all of the time. Famke Janseen still looks great, though she probably had a lot of work done. And the funny thing is she seems more bad then good in the dreams. And if you watch the film, she's always giving him bad advice. Though it's probably just Wolverine thinking up all of that stuff.<br/><br/>There is a really cool scene of Wolverine walking beside a grizzly bear. Both don't bother each other- just walk by. It shows that Wolverine is an animal just like this grizzly.<br/><br/>There is a mutant named Viper, and is she something. Great casting. She has probably one of the sexiest voices I've ever heard too.<br/><br/>The Japanese girls Yukio and Mariko were great. I actually cared when they were in trouble. Mariko was just beautiful too. My mom was wondering if she was a model.<br/><br/>The scene that the audience really seemed to enjoy was the train sequence. When Wolverine jumped to make the other guy jump to his death when they were on the train was truly awesome.<br/><br/>What doesn't make sense to me however is that when Wolverines claws cut into something to stop him from going anywhere just doesn't make sense. I mean, his claws are can cut through anything. I don't see how he can gain traction.<br/><br/>The end didn't make sense. In X2 Deathstrike had audamantium claws and it didn't cut through, but in this film audamantium claws drill through his quite easily. I thought they were indestructible. And I thought he couldn't heal. I mean, if he popped his claws he'd be bleeding all over the place.<br/><br/>But this movie was great. When Wolverine got the bug out from his heart that was awesome. It was also awesome when the ninjas shot him down with what seemed like over a dozen arrows.<br/><br/>So I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to see it. Stay after the credits to for a nice little surprise."
"rider-759-5473","1","10","19","8 August 2013"," Agreed, Worst X-men movie EVER
","Possible spoilers included. I do not have the patience to outline all the details of why this movie was bad, but ultimately it didn't make sense. So many unanswered questions and basically unbelievable scenes. Since when does Wolverine have to fight someone with a Samuri sword for several minutes clashing blades together and not immediately cut through the blade? He fights on top of a bullet train with some yakuza thugs for several minutes, slashing long gaping holes in the top of the train, but no one in the train notices anything. Much of the story is dependant upon Wolverine actually sticking around in Japan. You know what, I said I wasn't going to do this, so yeah, the story sucks."
"tiwarinatwar","5","10","19","7 August 2013"," Big names, small deliverance...
","I am a fan of Wolverine, however i do feel the movie is rated way beyond it's caliber. The movie starts with an inner struggle brewing inside our Hero. how he is taken off the worldly ways, and trying to forget the past. To suppress its vulnerability as a soldier, to protect the weak and stand for what is right. It takes a turn to fatality, with Wolverine landing in Japan. And then movie starts to tumble, where the yakuza,the Ninjas, Samurais and what not are thrown in like a garnishing on a typical Indian Masala movie. The Movie could use some more editing, the storyline a little more tightening. It sometimes make you lose plot, who is fighting whom and protecting whom. Even if it is meant for casual viewer ship, it drags at some points and go haphazard at others. Its not a great movie,but hey we just want to see the wildness unleashed on the screen,could be watched once, if you are patient enough and an action fan."
"bm2759","8","16","34","6 August 2013"," More story and character than expected
","To my surprise this film is quite good. Largely because it focuses on story and character with humour thrown in for good measure. Action sequences and the superpowers support this film instead which makes this a far better film than just another superhero movie. <br/><br/>The story could be called predictable. Logan is tormented over killing Jean Grey and shes her when awake and sleeping. Her presence and inherent craziness forces him to live as a homeless man in the wild. A chance to say goodbye to an old friend gives him a chance for redemption. Those of us who have seen this story before could predict the outcome however it is still interesting because Japan is an interesting setting, we want Logan to get the peace he deserves, and poignant action scenes give us a chance to see Logan vent his anger.<br/><br/>Much better than I expected it to be."
"Troy_Campbell","4","16","34","25 July 2013"," Serious, subdued and lacking in fun.
","Taking place after the events of X-Men 3: The Last Stand, the regenerative beast's second solo outing (set in Japan, but largely shot in Sydney) deals almost exclusively in grief, guilt and seeking a means to an end. If that sounds a bit sombre and unblockbuster-y, then that's because it is. More of a samurai drama than a fantasy action pic, those seeking the usual X- Men tropes – such as huge, CGI-driven set pieces and colourful, mutated characters going at it hammer and tongs – will be very, very disappointed. The action is subdued and rather repetitive, with even the martial arts being somewhat lacklustre and uninventive despite arguably being the centrepiece of the film, whilst, in the movie's biggest flaw, the only other mutant to keep Wolvie company is an underwhelming hench(wo)man played by Russian model Svetlana Khodchenkova. The lack of other ""freaks"" on screen allows for a deep study into Wolverine's psyche through a patient, meditative story of redemption – which is a noble intention – but regrettably, it also saps the fun right out of proceedings, potentially alienating mainstream X-Men fans along the way. In his seventh appearance as the tormented soul with metal claws, Hugh Jackman has now reached a point where he simply is Wolverine and again attacks the role with the passion we've come to expect, although employing the superb Hiroyuki Sanada (Sunshine, The Last Samurai) in such a short and thankless part goes down as a missed opportunity. Not a bad film if you can shake off expectations based on previous entries into the franchise, but not one I can recommend either."
"Haider-kazmee","10","12","24","8 November 2013"," Watch the Extended Edition Way better than theatrical version !
","I was waiting so long to see this film. The only reason I disagreed with the negative reviewers is because some of them don't have much knowledge about the character Wolverine. For example, their confused of why doesn't he age because they clearly discuss this in the first X-men film when they find Logan. I'm a huge fan of X-men and I loved X-men First class. Anyways The Wolverine film that was shown in cinemas wasn't that great it was missing some explanations. Then I watched the Extended version which had an additional 14 mins and they've added blood to the fights. If you know the character Wolverine from the comics then you will fall in love with this movie. The extended version was the best superhero movie I've seen this year. Lastly without spoiling anything this version has something special after the credits showing a scene that takes place two years after the film. I give this movie a 10/10 because it is pure badass . Definitely waiting for the sequel."

","If you read the critics you would think that this Wolverine movie was better than the last; well they're wrong. I had high hopes after reading mostly positive reviews but after actually watching the movie I have to say that it was ridiculously boring. I am so tired of superhero movies that go from one fight scene to the next without any explanation, character or plot development. This movie suffered greatly from overkill with fighting. Also this movie suffers from confusing female characters. Mariko who we are suppose to like comes off as annoying. The Viper comes off as creepy. The only good female character is Yukio who steals the movie from wolverine every time they appear together. The plot was thin and any ending surprises projected themselves almost from the beginning of the movie. Poor Hugh Jackman, poor wolverine."
"A_Different_Drummer","7","6","10","13 January 2014"," Could pass for Torture/Porn
","1. Could pass for torture porn. When did the mark of a successful action evolve to the point that the hero has to undergo on-screen pain that ordinarily one would ordinarily only see if training as a resident in a downtown emergency ward? 2. Point 1 above is not coincidence. MAN OF STEEL went the same route. We have come a long way from the days when the bad guy threatened to cut James Bond in half with a laser, but the laser was turned off before Bond's suit even lost its crease.<br/><br/>3. Hugh Jackman may himself be a mutant, a fact other reviewers have missed. He is in his 40s, he can sing and do Broadway, but for some reason he shines in these actioners, and rises far above the script. Someone should check HIS Dna.<br/><br/>4. Another things reviewers have missed is that, with the X-Men franchise in particular, the first one was, and is, the best one. I dare you to prove me wrong.<br/><br/>5. Which animals eat their young? The answer includes directors and producers who kill a franchise deliberately, by killing all the characters, and then find themselves forced to do ""origins."" 6.

"p-jonsson","7","6","10","30 November 2013"," Good entertainment but stop short of being great
","This is definitely a good and entertaining movie. For me however, it falls short of being great due to a couple of things that I really did not like. Be warned that the rest of this review contains a few spoilers if you have not watched the movie before reading this.<br/><br/>The movie begins quite well. I liked Wolverine getting into that bar taking revenge on the idiot hunting bears with poisoned darts. Then it did not continue so well. My main issue is that they screw with Wolverines healing powers really early on in the movie so that he is handicapped for a good chunk of it. I really did not like that. Now this does not stop there from being quite a few cool action sequences. The fight sequence on the Japanese bullet train was quite cool although a wee bit too drawn out perhaps.<br/><br/>Eventually he manages to get his powers back although the happiness does not last very long. In the final combat they actually deprive Wolverine of his adamantium claws and it doesn't look like he gets those back. What the f is that? Sure, he regrows his original bone claws but that is not the same thing. Wolverine should have his adamantium claws, full stop. This is something I really dislike with a lot of Hollywood producers and directors now. They feel that they have to create some shock effect by destroying icons and constants in the world of movie fantasy. Like blowing up the Enterprise over and over again. I just hate it and for me this is the one thing that really stops this from being a great movie. Either they somehow give him back his proper claws or they can just as well make a reboot as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>It is quite sad that they, I will not say ruined but at least, diminished the movie in this way. Otherwise it would have been a great movie. It has a lot of nice action, a not too bad script and Hugh Jackman is very good as Wolverine. Actually the only one I thought was somewhat si so is Dr Green who's acting is rather pathetic.<br/><br/>All in all a good and entertaining movie that could have been a lot better if it was not for the Hollywood dimwits who felt they had to put something shocking in it and screwed it up."
"adam-scrivner","5","9","17","7 August 2013"," A missed opportunity
","I watched this film only last night, so thought that I would write a review while it was still fresh in my mind.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is promising, but is quickly ruined by some very unconvincing CGI, which is a shame. Jackman's character is his usual brooding self in the opening few scenes, quickly re-establishing himself on screen and setting the tone. Then begins the gradual decline of this film into a seemingly non-stop mess of action sequences that had me looking at my watch after only 45 minutes.<br/><br/>The plot is there, and although some spirited attempts are seemingly made to keep it going throughout the picture, it is very easily lost amongst the equally tenuous sub-plots. There are not really any surprises in this film, as any potential twists are so easy to spot in advance that I would advise leaving your brain at home if you go to the cinema to watch it.<br/><br/>It could have been excellent - Wolverine is, after all, a very strong character - but as with so many films of late if half of the money that was spent on CGI was instead spent on the script, then the film would have been infinitely better.<br/><br/>This film passes the time adequately but no more."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","9","17","2 August 2013"," A Japanese movie, for all intents and purposes, with English dialogue
","After a very brief, inconsequential prologue somewhere in the cold North American mountains, the scene moves to Tokyo, then Nagasaki. Except for our protagonist and one villain (I'll come to her later), the entire cast is Japanese. The movie will work just as well had the two Caucasian characters also been Japanese. This is NOT saying it is not a good Wolverine movie – how can it not be, with Hugh Jackman rejuvenated from Jean Valjean? I'm just saying that this is an adventure action template that can be fit into any exotic culture anywhere in Asia, the Southern Hemisphere, or even Europe.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with the two PRE-quels (""X-men origins: Wolverine"" in 2009 and ""X-men: first class"" in 2011), this one can be considered remotely as ""X-men 4"", as it picks up where ""X-men 3: the last stand"" (2006) left off. In this one, however, Logan is the only one you see (not counting cameos of Jean Grey in his dreams). Since the last one was 7 years ago, perhaps a quick reminder is not out-of-place. Jean Grey who died in ""X-men 2"" resurrected with a Jekyll-Hyde personality in ""X-men 3"", only to be killed by Logan in order to save the world, at her own imploring.<br/><br/>In the aforementioned prologue, we saw Logan tormented by two dreams, one of which is Jean Grey. The other is used as a flashback - 1945 Nagasaki. Ageless, immortal Logan who happened to be in a prisoner camp (don't ask why – I have no idea how any WWII prison camp could hold him) saved Japanese soldier Yashida's life when the bomb was dropped. Back to the present: forever agonizing over the loss of Jean Grey, Logan apparently severed any link with the X-men community, becoming an angry lost soul seeking solace in alcohol but with the fire for justice still occasionally burning.<br/><br/>The story really begins when he received an invitation from Yashida, delivered by a cute pop-star-ish but deadly Ninja-type Yukio, private-jet-readied. In Tokyo, he finds an aged Yashida on death-bed, but also the head of a mega corporation with cutting-edge research facilities. He offers Logan relief from the curse of immortality (""grow old and die"" from ""Logan's run"" seems an appropriate quote to cite here) by transferring it to himself. Sound so altruistic, doesn't it? The rest of the plot, even though a tad complicated at times, is all but predictable.<br/><br/>There is a pageantry of characters, somewhere in the twilight zone between interesting and banal. Yashida's son Shingen is all stereotype – ambitious, ruthless. Ditto (stereotype, that is) granddaughter Mariko (i.e. Shingen's daughter) with the standard role of damsel in distress cum hero's love interest. Aforementioned Yukio, by the way, is a girl picked up by the family from the garbage (quite literally as they found her, at age 4, searching for food in a garbage dump) who has since developed a sisterly bond with Mariko. A little shadier is a character named Harada (think of him as the Japanese version of Hawkeye), Mariko's ex-boyfriend (""ex"" because of family objection, her family obviously) who is always lurking somewhere in the background. Then there is the aforementioned only other Caucasian character: voluptuous Viper, a brilliant scientist in the organization, as well as mutant possessing a reptilian tongue and a kiss-of-death.<br/><br/>""The Wolverine"" is a well-rounded good action movie. Predictability notwithstanding, the plot serves well in anchoring the action which is competently crafted. With the proliferation of fully-developed CGI action movies today, it is not easy to impress. Yet, this movie comes up with one sequence that does impress: an elaborated melee that takes place on top of a bullet train (about the mid-point of the movie)."
"PyroSikTh","8","9","17","31 July 2013"," Wolverine finally gets the treatment he deserves!
","Finally we have a Wolverine movie to be proud of. I'm not even exaggerating when I say the X- Men franchise hasn't been this good in ten years. The beginning of First Class with Magneto going on his revenge binge was definitely one of the highlights of the franchise, but it was let down a little by the rest of the movie. The Wolverine is that first half hour of First Class stretched out to a full-length movie. It's darker, more serious, grounded, but without losing it's X-Men charm. It very much focuses on character and plot rather than squeezing in a million different mutants and action sequences, which altogether makes it hugely more enjoyable.<br/><br/>One thing that will make every Wolverine fan very happy though is that it pushes the limits for it's certificate in the violence department. Wolverine's claws actually have blood on them after he stabs someone, and there's plenty of gruesome moments that happen just off screen (including slicing a man in half, and a character reaching inside their own chest). But it's not all off-screen. There's one particularly harrowing sequence at the film's climax that's sure to make you squirm, but I won't spoil it. The example I'll use instead is at the beginning when Wolverine saves Yashida from the Nagasaki bombing. We see Wolverine in all his glory burnt to a radiated crisp. It's a shocking thing to see, especially from this certificate. It seems the level of gore and violence in this movie is pitch perfect, showing just enough to push the boundaries and make a character who has metal claws in his knuckles believable, without going over the top with limbs and heads flying all over the place leaving fountains of blood.<br/><br/>The plot was the biggest surprise for me though. Wolverine is haunted by the events of Last Stand, having nightmares of Jean Grey almost every night. His memory of her follows him wherever he goes and goes a way to dictate his decisions throughout the movie, and it gives him a very emotional edge that makes the character all the more sympathetic. On the verge of giving up, he's given the proposition of transferring his healing powers to the soldier he saved all those decades ago. He declines and what follows is a breakneck tale of family, of betrayal, of survival. He finds himself weak without his healing abilities, and the girl he's taken upon himself to protect seems to be the target of everyone, from the mob to the corporation, from a mutant who calls herself viper to an army of ninjas. Who's pulling the strings? What is everyone's agenda? Who are really the bad guys? It's a puzzle where the pieces all finally come together in a twist during the final climax that I guarantee you won't see coming.<br/><br/>It's not without a couple of holes though, which is unfortunate and keeps it from rating higher. The most obvious of which is a few things are left unexplained. We learn what it is that takes Wolverine's healing powers, but we never learn how or why. We're introduced to the Silver Samurai in the closing moments, but why does it exist? To what end? Not even the twist that attempts to explain the Silver Samurai really does a particularly satisfactory job. Also Viper herself is still left a bit of an enigma by the end, which gives one the impression that she was added in just as another mutant in a distinctly mutant-less movie (Wolverine, Viper, and Yukio are the only mutants in the whole film).<br/><br/>Finally the action scenes were pretty great, most of which comprising of hand-to-hand fighting. Pretty much any scene where Yukio fights is guaranteed to have you awing in wonder as she effortlessly flips and slides all over the place. She's obviously a graceful fighter with tuned agility and balance and it all shows off in the simply fantastic choreography. Wolverine's fight scenes on the other hand are much more brutish and muscled. He literally walks in the face of bullets and every beat and slice from his claws his felt. His first fight after he regains his healing abilities is suitably badass as he faces off against a samurai of sorts. He just takes all the stabs and cuts and then heals back up. He hardly throws a move until the finishing one. It's a fight that rings all the more victorious after the struggles he's endured for half the movie, feeling pain and exhaustion like a normal man would.<br/><br/>The story is fantastic; complex enough to keep you on the edge your seat without being too in- depth and lead to confusion. The action is very well choreographed and shot well enough (it'll probably look better on a smaller screen where it's easier to take in the whole picture), and the effects and cinematography makes it a beautiful movie for the eyes. Finally the post-credits sequence. I won't spoil it but it is easily the best post-credits sequence ever, even surpassing Marvel's own post-credits scenes in their Avenger's pantheon. In fact it's worth the price of admission to see that one scene alone, and I was tempted to bump up the rating of the whole movie just for it. Alas that doesn't quite seem right, so I grant The Wolverine a very good 8/10. It's easily the best X-Men movie since X2 a decade ago.<br/><br/>http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/"
"filmtrance","7","9","17","29 July 2013"," The Wolverine shows off Logan's vulnerable side.
","Walk the Line director James Mangold was tasked with bringing Logan back to the big screen in what is Hugh Jackman's sixth outing as the Wolverine after last making an appearance in an uncredited cameo role in the 2011 hit film X-Men: First Class.<br/><br/>The film, which Mangold has said follows on from the 2006 hit film X-Men: The Last Stand which saw the disbandment of the group and the deaths of Jean Gray and Professor Charles Xavier, sees Logan struggling to cope with his past in an uncertain future. With the love of his life dead (Jean Gray, played by Famke Janssen), he finds it tough to find motivation to go on. Haunted by terrorising nightmares and flashbacks of Grey, The Wolverine's strength is most certainly in its dark, gritty portrayal of Logan's problems.<br/><br/>After establishing that Logan once saved a Japanese soldiers life by covering him from the blasts of the Atomic Bomb that hit Hiroshima in 1945, that same solider, now the dying billionaire Yashida (Hal Yamonouchi), sends his loyal staff member Yukio (Rila Fukushima) to track him down. Logan's understanding is that it is to say a final goodbye to an old friend, however on arrival he finds that he was taken there under false pretences. He quickly finds himself entangled in the task of saving Yahida's beloved Granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) from harms way, a journey that may just turn out to save himself from his demons as well as the girl he has begun to fall for.<br/><br/>The film asks several key questions of Logan and shows a side to him not often seen: vulnerability. Is immortality what Logan truly desires? On his way to self discovery he finds that what he was beginning to see as his greatest weakness is in fact his biggest strength.<br/><br/>The Wolverine will have not let any die-hard X-Men fans down in its portrayal of Logan. Jackman's strong performance that gives an intriguing insight into his characters mindset is the real backbone to what is an engaging, yet rather menacing piece of film. Certain questions are left unanswered, as into the motives of certain characters, but the effective blend of intense, but certainly not over-played, fight-sequences and the strength of Jackman's portrayal of the Wolverine sees you looking past these minor faults and being able to easily enjoy the spectacle that Mangold has pieced together.<br/><br/>Twitter: @FilmTrance Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Film-Trance/144519832376155?ref=hl"
"billygoat1071","5","11","22","26 July 2013"," Underwhelming Results
","Many people weren't impressed with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, mostly because comic book fans wanted Wolverine to get a grittier and less ridiculous take. The Wolverine tries to get all of that right. It builds a potential theme in the story and gives the hero a serious challenge. The problem is, it's not really compelling and instead of being actually ""dark"", it's once again relies on being extremely serious with little substance. The Wolverine has some bold choices of becoming a ""more than just an action blockbuster"" film, but it fails to justify what it should have been.<br/><br/>The film puts some interesting choices for its story; what is it like to be mortal after living the rest of your life being indestructible? It's an interesting idea to transcend the material. There could be an intriguing look back, showing more humanity in this mutant. This isn't the first movie to have a hero losing his powers(well, healing powers). It has become a trend in superhero movies in a while, though this is actually one of the best things that has happened in the genre, but The Wolverine misses one important thing. Although this is supposed to be about Logan fighting his demons, the film didn't develop enough about the significance of his weakness other than trying to overcome his weird obsession for Jean Grey by having interests with another girl. Seems like the whole point of him being weak is to avoid lending his special power to the wrong hands, but through it all, we rarely see the character change in his heroic test.<br/><br/>Apart from the thematic stuff, the film sends Wolverine in a new environment. We only see few mutants around and more ninjas and other ricier proportions. It can be gripping, otherwise less inspired. The action scenes aren't too inventive except the bullet train fight which is the only absurdity you'll see. At least the use of violence here is more than just an action fan pleasure, portraying the horrors of violence even in an interminable flesh. The performances are good enough. Hugh Jackman is still the Wolverine that we always loved.<br/><br/>It's good that the franchise has become conscious about itself. The last Wolverine movie was nothing more than an extreme blockbuster pleasure without anything much inside. The Wolverine would have been powerful. It has a potentially good story that may top all the crazy action. Instead, it spends most of the runtime brooding at the less interesting life problems of Logan, but that's how his last journey ends, by the way. It's just would have been better if it's centrally about obsession of power or why some men seeks for immortality, and improving the hero's view on things after the challenge he faced. That's the opposite result of the film, leading to an emptier experience. No one's blaming the dark/gritty turn since it's a good idea coming from the fans, but the execution ends up underwhelming."
"juneebuggy","7","5","8","1 October 2015"," Entertaining with some great action scenes but far from perfect
","Decent enough movie although far from perfect showcasing (an often) shirtless Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine in an X-Men spin off. This opens with Logan living as an Alaskan bush man (bearded, drinking lots, camping in the open woods) as he's still mourning the death of Jean Grey. He then travels to Japan to visit a dying old friend and learns that there's a way he can remove his immortality, but soon gets caught up in a conspiracy involving his friends devious family and the Yakuza.<br/><br/>This was a bit all over the place as parts of it were very good and others were long, drawn out (even a bit dull at times) It is filled with some great action scenes though (the train sequence was cool, the funeral/Yakuza kidnapping, the final battle with the Samari 'Real Steel' robot -exciting) and Hugh Jackman looks amazing, wow he must have spent some hours in the gym.<br/><br/>I liked the flashback sequences to WWll in Nagasaki. I didn't really understand the propose of the Jean Grey dream (fantasies?) especially when Logan is sleeping with other women. I liked that this took place almost exclusively in Japan -refreshing. There were some things that didn't make sense (like Logan's claws) and just assorted other plot holes I chose to ignore. The motivation from the bad guys was also a bit vague but whatever.<br/><br/>As a whole, an entertaining movie though, make sure to watch past the closing credits for a bonus scene. 9/19/15"

","I actually really like this movie. I applaud them for daring to try something different. There really aren't any other movies quite like this. It definitely draws closely from various movies, but its not like your average superhero movie.<br/><br/>I think the plot is actually really cool and is actually pretty realistic for a superhero movie. The cinematography is beautiful and the locations and production design are nice as well. The whole Japanese samurai ninja culture is always cool and it is fun to see it blended with an x- men story. <br/><br/>There aren't many other superheroes in this movie, which is refreshing. Especially nowadays where they seem to pack way too many characters into every movie. Besides Wolverine, I really only recall poison Ivy being in the movie, and she goes by a different name and looks mostly like a normal person.<br/><br/>I forget what the criticism was of this movie. I remember people complaining that Wolverine doesn't have his powers for most of the movie, but that didn't bother me at all. The story builds to a nice climax and the pace is pretty good.<br/><br/>I wish more superhero movies would take risks and try to be original and creative like they did here. Go see this movie if you like a good action flick or x-men or Samurai culture."

"Al_The_Strange","8","4","6","14 June 2014"," The Wolverine Review
","Wolverine has been through so much. In spite of that, he remains one of the biggest superheroes of comic-book legend, and thanks to Hugh Jackman's performance in four previous X-Men movies, he became one of the biggest cinematic icons of modern times. Even though the character received his stand-alone film in 2009, filmmakers wanted to go farther and deeper with the character. Taking after Chris Claremont's and Frank Miller's comic, The Wolverine would test the character's limits in Japan.<br/><br/>This film is nowhere near as overblown as other X-Men films: the action is confined to just a few fights. Some of the highlights include a fight on top of a high-speed bullet-train, confrontations with a small army of ninjas, and a final showdown with a giant armored samurai suit. These are fairly cool fights that show off quality choreography and a few cool weapons, but there's very little wow factor. The film does satisfy in the same way thrillers like The Man From Nowhere or Crying Freeman do, but it feels far less like a superhero movie, or even an X-Men movie. Those searching for big, explosive action might be let down, but there is still merit in this moody, slow-burning drama.<br/><br/>The Wolverine takes its time to breathe, giving a steady focus on the title character. It is a much-needed character study; as a sequel to X-Men: The Last Stand, Wolverine is a broken man, tormented by guilt and deprived of purpose. As he travels to Japan and becomes caught up in a major conspiracy, he is revealed to be a figurative ronin: a master-less samurai struggling to regain his honor, perhaps even through death. Due to these issues, and with the threat of taking away his healing powers, this is Wolverine at his most vulnerable, and it makes for a very intense struggle. The conflict runs good and hard throughout the story, and the plot is well-structured. The story has a dense layer of conspiracy that's not exactly easy to comprehend, especially with so many side characters, but other parts are predictable. At the film's core, however, strong parallels are drawn between Wolverine and the Bushido code, and it makes for a rather compelling show.<br/><br/>This film uses pretty straightforward photography and editing, and it's refreshing that way. Acting is good: Hugh Jackman is still perfect as Wolverine, and the rest of the cast is decent and feels authentic. Writing is good. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Locales in particular look authentic, and it helps, since the setting plays a major role in this story. Music is not bad either.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is the film the character deserves, with emphasis on ""THE"" to indicate that this is not just another plain ol' superhero flick, but an exploration on the character and his quest for absolution. Viewers might find this dull, but it exceeded my expectations in spite of the dramatic aspects. In the end, I enjoyed watching the character, both for the action and for the melodrama. It is a worthwhile experience overall.<br/><br/>This film has an extended cut available on specific home video editions. It is an evenly-paced cut that boasts some longer dialogue and longer action scenes (primarily with the ninja fight toward the end), including a little more R-rated cursing and a bit more bloodshed. For mature audiences, it's not a bad cut of the movie.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)"
"pk_nayar","8","10","20","31 July 2013"," The Wolverine - Makes His Mark!
","This will once again divide many, as in my opinion, the non-comic book reading fans wouldn't like this as much. I, on the other hand loved it! Very dialogue driven & story based. <br/><br/>Logan is tested emotionally & physically in this movie, and Jackman is once again in his element, it is as if, he was made to play Wolverine. There is lesser action & special effects compared to recent superhero films, which is refreshing. <br/><br/>The absence of mutants apart from Wolverine & Viper though is a small letdown. The treatment & ret-conning of The Silver Samurai is also somewhat a bust, as they take a totally different route as opposed to the original source.<br/><br/>However, I'm pleased by the film on the whole, in fact I would rate this as the best among the 3 superhero films released this year, yes even above Man of Steel.<br/><br/>Do wait for the credits to roll as the post-credit scene is a doozy.

"jan_kalina","1","23","55","25 July 2013"," ""This isn't going to end well!""
","Says Jean Grey during one of her visits in Wolverine's nightmares and yet she is right. The Wolverine might have started in a good fashion but it is not a good movie by any means.<br/><br/>First of all I have to say that I didn't want to see this movie in the cinema but I did because my friends wanted to go. I knew right form the first trailer that this won't be a good movie. This is one of the things when I'm not glad I'm right. I enjoyed all the previous X-men movies but the paradox is I loved most the X-men Movie which featured none of the cast from the previous movies and had a completely different director: X-Men: First Class.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is the exact opposite of what the fans desired and the creators of this film promised. The fans were promised a take on the character that would be more faithful to the comics and and above all more violent. I guess we never get an R rated Wolverine or X-men movie which is a huge pity. I mean this is a character who has claws in his hands but actually never see any blood. We just hear the sound of his claws ripping through someone and the look of pain on his opponent. So we have to let the imagination roll. Wolverine is a brutal killing machine but with his heart in the right place. That's not the case in the movies. Here his portrayal seems to me as quite wimpy, and he gets wimpier and wimpier in every movie. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is perfect fit for the role of Wolverine, which makes more sad that we probably never get a proper X-men or Wolverine movie with this actor. This movie doesn't move Wolverine's character arc anywhere. This is just a bridge between 2006's The Last Stand and next year's Days of the Future Past, which you also get teased in the mid credits scene, which might be one of the best scenes in the movie. The movie doesn't have a villain. I mean there is many figures who are the bad guys but it lacks a main villain. You know what they say, that the hero is just as good as the villain. <br/><br/>The movie takes place in Japan however director James Mangold makes no use of the Japanese element. In fact it seems to me that is film is quite disgraceful to Japan and its culture when almost all the Japanese characters are portrayed as evil, greedy and hungry for wealth and power. The music is as generic as it can get with a summer blockbuster. No sign on of Japanese element in the music, which could have been very helpful.<br/><br/>Don't waste your many on this piece of garbage and wait for the next year's Days of the Future Past which will once again an ensemble X-men movie. Looks like solo movies about one character from the X-men universe don't work.<br/><br/>P.S. X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the previous solo X-men movie which got a lot of hate is much better and more fun film than this."

","A vast improvement over the crapfest X-Men Origins Wolverine the film pretty much ignores the fact that the film even really happened which is a good thing. Picking it up after the finale of X3 we find our title character loning it up when he is found by a bad ass Japanese woman in search of him because he saved her boss some fifty odd years ago. After some discussion he decides to say his goodbyes and discovers a conspiracy involving the Yakuza trying to assassinate his granddaughter who Wolvie takes a liking too. The film is a little underdeveloped but engaging enough to merit some solid entertainment. Tightly choreographed fight scenes and some strong female characters as well as Jackman's lovable character and trademark biceps and Abs enhance the films viewing pleasure. A downfall is the character of Viper and the actress who plays her who are pretty cheesetastic and seem out of place in the films more reality based setting. I also wish they had spent a bit more time developing the films core relationship. Still what stands is a fun, somewhat ferocious and much improved installment of Jackman's lovable take on the iconic character.Stay a little after the credits for anintriguing cliffhanger.

","Wow. This is the Wolverine film that should have been made in the first place. It is one of the most viscerally powerful comic-book films that I have ever seen. There are not just fantasy-like action sequences with flashy special effects; these are fantastically choreographed scenes that hit as hard as real life. And there are a lot of them. Even more importantly, there is a compelling story, a well-written script and a *superb* cast, all of which make this film something truly meaningful. I will admit that I have suggested that this character has been overexposed, but that was partly based on the messy, unnecessary X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But I have nothing but praise for any decision that results in a film this good.<br/><br/>The setting in Japan brings all sorts of elements into play that work great with the character of Wolverine. Of course, the accompanying aesthetic touches give this film a unique feel among comic-book adaptions. The pacing is right on; the action scenes are relentless, the poignant scenes are breathless, and the dialog is sharp. I find it to be very well-balanced overall.<br/><br/>There may have been a thing or two not quite on the masterpiece level, and I am still ruminating on the story and plot developments in my mind. But this is an incredibly well-directed film, with the cinematography, visual effects, sound and again, the cast all contribute to the greater whole.<br/><br/>There is quite a lot of violence, and a bit more gore-ish content than found in the typical superhero film. But this is Wolverine. More than anything else, this is just a wonderful film in and of itself, but I also think that it does a fine job of (1) making X-Men: The Last Stand seem better and more meaningful in retrospect, (2) setting up future X-Men films and most importantly one might say (3) erasing the memory of the Origins film.<br/><br/>As usual for me, I avoided 3D and saw this film in 2D. No regrets whatsoever about that decision. In any event, I highly recommend The Wolverine. As good as X1 and X2 were, and as much as I liked X-Men: First Class, this one might be my favorite X-Film yet. I enjoyed both Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel (really), but even at that, The Wolverine is arguably the best superhero film released so far in 2013, and possibly one of the best yet, period."

","We had a deluge of super hero movies lately, and we are in danger of going numb because of overexposure. I keep wondering how is it that we don't get tired of reading those comic books. It might be because we invest a bit of our imagination in the development of the stories. In the movies we are the mercy of someone's interpretation, and it takes a very talented director and his/her team to engage us completely. At first, I wanted to give full credit to Hugh Jackman, an actor with plenty of charisma who makes you care for the character on the screen, and Wolverine is quite a fantastic creation that would have been a mediocre entry in the hands of less capable artists.<br/><br/>With the help of James Mangold, the film gives us plenty of humanity, this time making Wolverine's world a little more complex. The entire movie rides on his shoulders and his adventures as a newly mortal hero. He is still pretty formidable, but now he faces more difficult circumstances, as he is not able to heal as quickly, and there are several foes who might be able to destroy him.<br/><br/>Women are pretty strong characters here, even the repeated apparition of Wolverine's Ex. Something that a few people can find disturbing and unnecessary, but it helps us understand Wolverine's psyche. The issue is resolved by the end, and people should be satisfied with it.<br/><br/>This film is a bit more sophisticated than the other entries, at times feeling exotic because of the locale. Marigold gives us a fast and exciting film, with some quiet segments in between exploring the new relationships that Wolverine encounters. Overall is a pretty good movie."

"sidfargas","Null","11","23","24 July 2013"," This really is the Wolverine film we have been waiting for... GREAT FILM!
","The Wolverine exists in its own world and that's very refreshing at this point. I was so tired of Fox hammering in mutant cameos just for the sake of cameos and ruining future use of cool characters. The focus is on Logan separated from that X-Men Universe and they do it masterfully well. This movie has done what Fox has refused to do over the years. They touch on and stay true to plot essences from the books. The awesome Claremont/Miller saga really is felt in this film.<br/><br/>The start finds Logan coming in to a place where he is suffering from the loss of everyone he has known and cares about. His long life is a burden he can't shake and he's truly having difficulty handling the struggle of knowing he will lose everyone he loves all the time. The move to Japan as this happens is a masterful turn and fits so well as Logan learns that he is the same as a masterless samurai. Listen, I like alien invasions as much as the next guy but it is refreshing that this is not a film with a gigantic, nefarious force trying to destroy the Earth or take over. Logan's challenges are unique, challenging and fresh because the story really is counter to other genre plots. This is a mystery/drama/adventure film, not a superhero film. The stakes are much more personal. The consequences are much more grounded and involve people that you really do care about. This is how you write a summer film! I've read reviews and interviews that mention the classic samurai films and The Outlaw Josey Wales when talking about this movie and that is absolutely right on the mark. The say less/do more but still have character depth of the best of those films are in this film. This gem is NOT about Wolverine slashing his way through the enemy. Sure there's slice and dice action but the story is about love, about suicide, about calamity, about loss, about selfishness versus selflessness, about love lasting beyond the grave and about heart. It's as far away from a video game movie as it gets and this summer is in need of that right now.<br/><br/>Everything set up perfectly here and they sure did deliver. You have the right actor that's been already established and a X-world we already know enough about. They shelve any idea of an introduction or origin and finally tell an incredibly smart story we all wanted to see and one that hasn't been done before. This movie squarely focuses on Logan. It's a story just about him that allows him to explore everything that makes the character great. It explores everything including his rage, his methods of fighting, his honor, the conflict in his soul, his very nature, his intelligence and mystery solving abilities as well as his ability to love and have relationships. All of it without it having to juggle any team members or mutant plots. It's just what a Wolverine movie should be.<br/><br/>This is a gritty Wolverine. It's all about anger and determination and being a ""mutant monster"" created by both God and man. He was born with his mutant abilities but was augmented with adamantium by man. Knowing what he is and what he has done has left psychic wounds. That depth and the gritty action really gives this film the grounded feel. Like with all good Marvel films, it feels like this wild stuff can occur in this world and it isn't so fantastical that it pulls you out of the film. The balance is perfect and thrilling. This really is the Wolverine film we have been waiting for and my favorite movie of the year to date."

","After watching the film, I can say the least that I was confused. I was also a bit dazed as what themes the movie tried to convey. All in all, the film was decent. The protagonist encounters conflict, rises up to the occasion and becomes the hero. However, there were a few places that bugged me. First, the fight scenes were very dull but overboard in the sense that ""the wolverine"" could not die. Logan literally acted as the punching bag for the duration of the movie. Every scene has him taking gruesome hits until he decides to defeat each respective opponent with one hit. Second, the sex scene with Mariko seemed inconsistent since he kept on thinking about Jean. Don't know what this movie is trying to convey... Third, the movie was very generous with throwing deaths around. I mean, the only characters not to die at the end of the movie was Logan, Mariko, and Yukio. At the end of every battle scene, it appears that Logan must end the life of his opponent. One thing I really did like was the incorporation of a tiny bit of Japanese culture into the movie. I thought it added to the diversity of the movie. I could be totally biased though, since I am a Japanese junkie. All in all, a great action movie which will kill you some time. If you're hoping to watch a meaningful movie, then you'll be a bit disappointed."

","Well, the wife liked it, and usually that's a big thumbs down from the guys, but for once, I have to agree with her! I really enjoyed this movie, from several angles.<br/><br/>I really liked the fleshing out of Logan's character, and think they pulled it off. I really enjoyed the Japanese setting, the on the run type movie very much like Bourne Identity, and liked the plot twist of Logan's sudden vulnerability. Super heroes are much more enjoyable when they are mortal, which is why I've always despised Superman...<br/><br/>The ninjas were, horrible, knowing full well what that is all about and being one, the modern ninja is the yakuza assassin, not the clown costume bozos in this movie who give bujinkan a bad name... Enough on that, yes I see you tracing my IP...<br/><br/>Perhaps the one flaw in this movie was the ending, which tried to 'sew a pig stomach explosion into a Gucchi bag'. Too many twists trying to weave together, too many characters suddenly acting COMPLETELY DIFFERENT at the end of the movie to fit a plot twist (GOD I HATE THAT TRICK!!) All in all though, a definite watch for all Wolverine fans, as I am, having named my son LOGAN and all ;)"

","I saw the movie yesterday afternoon. For the most part; I thought it was an "" OK "" movie. Not great, didn't knock my socks off. But the fight sequences were something to see. <br/><br/>Wolverine's fight with the animatronic samurai was worth the price of admission alone. You can only see that close up. <br/><br/>Wolverine's a soldier. Plain and simple. He's not so much a protector of the innocent young flower child. <br/><br/>The plot twists and turns were pretty much predictable. The old man revealing his true colors at the end was somewhat surprising. <br/><br/>As for what everyone's talking about - the bonus scene: <br/><br/>I admit; even I was surprised to see Xavier back in one piece. From the thousands Jean Grey blew him into during X-MEN The Last Stand.<br/><br/>Can't wait for Days of Future's Past. <br/><br/>If Wolverine can have his hands full with one metal samurai; he's going to need a little more help battling Sentinels."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","7","13","27 July 2013"," The best at doing what Wolverine is - and that *is* very nice
","With the X-Men disbanded(no, this doesn't retcon The Last Stand or Origins) and Jean gone(albeit she does appear in this - I won't give away how, but it's perfect for dealing with this part of the aftermath of the previous entries; and Janssen does brilliantly), Logan(Jackman, nailing the role again, hard-drinking and brooding without making it dull - and in the best shape yet) is about to give up. He won't use violence(except for how brutal and bloody this is for being PG-13...), and he's facing inner demons, and the curse of immortality. What good is it to live forever, when those you love die horribly? Yashida(Yamanouchi/Yamamura, given a major arc, and bringing up the further themes of integrity and honor), the dying leader of a huge corporation who he saved at Nagasaki(...!), offers him a chance to die naturally. His granddaughter, Mariko(Okamoto, arguably the lesser of the all-strong female-dominated supporting, all Japanese, cast, who still holds her own) is targeted, and Wolverine protects her.<br/><br/>When you add her mysterious, acrobatic childhood friend Harada(Yun Lee), her abusive father Shingen(Sanada) who both do well in their performances, the pixie-like short badass Yukio(Fukushima, who steals the whole movie - I demand a trilogy devoted to her) who recruits our hero, and the cold doctor Viper(Khodchenkova, who gives the sole poor performance - given that this is about the only English title on her filmography, maybe it's a language barrier thing?) who there may just be something more to, it might sound like this makes the usual mistake of far too many people. I am happy to report that nothing could be further from the truth. The character relationships in this are compelling, dialog well-written, and everything holds up to scrutiny(in fact, this does a tremendous job with subtle setup and payoff) until the third act where all of that and the plot implodes, as we patiently sit through a tedious climax-in-placement-only of a fight.<br/><br/>As this might tell you, this is a stand-alone. While not ignoring continuity, it is far more about giving us a gripping portrayal of our protagonist. Every so often, a standard Summer blockbuster comic book flick will claw its way to the surface. Yes, this does lead to a feeling of genre schizophrenia, and this certainly isn't without its flaws - some of them substantial - still, the inspired elements make it well worth your attention, even if they don't all gel. That is, if you're already a fan. If the berserker rage and Adamantium doesn't already get you going, this one will not change anything. This is a great place to start, if you haven't checked these out so far - it's self-contained and explains everything you need to know well, without spoiling anything it doesn't need to about the others. The action is well-choreographed, and at its best, gets the mano-a-mano, high physicality and intensity that Mangold went for - at its worst, the go-to of shaky-cam makes it hard to follow. There is an appropriate amount of it and none of it goes on for too long.<br/><br/>As an adaptation of the beloved Claremont/Miller mini, this doesn't stray excessively, or stay chokingly close(*cough*Watchmen*cough*). The 3D is barely noticeable - not only a post-conversion. I'd go for 2D; as long as you do go. FX are convincing, save for one early thing, and this doesn't disappear into a heap of CGI - the martial arts are clearly real, stunts and practical work heightening the credibility in a thoroughly realistic world - that does have some superpowers. This makes it fit with the Singer two-logy - further enabling this to wash out the bad taste the earlier attempt at a solo outing. The 115 minute running time before the credits that you should stay through(at least to the midway point) passes by smoothly. I wasn't always at the edge of my seat, but I was nearly always engaged.<br/><br/>There is a lot of disturbing content and a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of these - graphic novels and motion pictures alike. 8/10"

","I've been a fair fan of the series of the whole. Even the weaker installments I thoroughly enjoyed, so my review is already weighed in favor of this film. I will say even from a critics point of view I thought it was really well done. It's not the standard comic book faire, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than previous installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found interesting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who provided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests. I found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after all the time we've get to see him in all his cinematic installments."
"spamtuli","3","9","18","5 August 2013"," Wolverine weak, old, and slow???
","OK, so this Wolverine was better than the previous one, but that's not much of a compliment since the other one was just completely terrible. <br/><br/>Rather than rehashing all of the reviews written, I only want to add the following: To me, in addition to what's already been said, they screwed up 2 very important things in both Wolverine movies...<br/><br/>1. They don't make him bad ass enough. He's always getting his butt kicked left and right in both movies, and the Wolverine I know from the comics is unbeatable. I mean in the first Wolverine movie Sabretooth just completely manhandles him (wouldn't play out that way in the comics). In this second film, Logan keeps getting his butt handed to him by random dudes with guns that sneak up on him. The reason he has such a following is because he's a total ""bad ass"" and nobody ever gets the drop on him. The directors NEED TO SHOW WOLVERINE KICKING ASS MORE!!!! Sorry for yelling.<br/><br/>2. His enhanced senses and reflexes are not emphasized at all. One of the things that makes him so hard to beat aside from his healing, and adamantium are his animal senses and reflexes. So he should be shown being more agile and alert than anyone else on screen.<br/><br/>If you agree please sound off so studio types can hear about this for any future incarnations. We know someday there will be a reboot of the X-men franchise and therefore Wolverine as well. Let's make sure they do it right when they go back to the drawing board."

","Epic scale, wide scope and large scale destruction have become par for the course in the genre of big budget Summer comic book movies, with each new film seemingly trying to top the previous one. But this Summer we've seen two of these so-called popcorn movies take a very non-traditional approach to blockbuster entertainment.<br/><br/>The first was 'Iron Man 3'. Yes the final act had its share of 'Things go boom!' carnage, but for most of its running time it was a smaller and more personal story than its predecessors (It also wasn't very good). And now we can add 'The Wolverine', another character-centric comic book movie where its not the entire world in the balance, but instead one man's world. That man—or mutant—is Logan, AKA Wolverine. Hugh Jackman returns to the role for the sixth time (if you count his memorable cameo in 'X-Men: First Class'), and he's in fine form. By now he has this character down cold, and his barely contained rage and intensity help to carry this film just above the slog that it otherwise is.<br/><br/>It's beautifully shot and often very thoughtful, but neither the action nor the half-baked story are propulsive enough to make us care. The Wolverine is yet another dud in the ""Summer of disappointment""."

Rather than blasting us with a slew of new faces and abilities I was introduced to only a few additions. What, might you ask,filled the rest of the film? Depth, this film delves into Logan's emotions in a way none of the others have before.<br/><br/>Personally, I found this to be a positive factor. While the previous films were indeed favorites of mine, I always wished that we would get a better chance to ""know"" some of the more prominent characters.

","Wolverine is my favorite superhero and I am a huge fan of the X-Men movies as the first two are my favorite of all superhero movies. I enjoy that Fox has been taking on Wolverine and doing films about him. James Mangold, whose previous directing credits include Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma, is the man helming this new Wolverine adventure.<br/><br/>The Wolverine begins with Logan (Hugh Jackman) as a prisoner in a POW camp in Japan during World War II, where he saves a soldier named Yashida after the American drop the atomic bomb. This however, is a flashback as Logan wakes up finding himself in bed next to Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who he ends up killing back in X-Men: The Last Stand. This is also a flashback as Logan currently lives a recluse life in the Canadian wilderness. Logan is found by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a fellow mutant who has the power to see how people die. Yukio is there to find Logan and bring him to Japan as Yashida is dying. In Japan, Logan also meets Mariko (Tao Okamoto), Yashida's granddaughter. Yashida offers to trade powers with Logan, who turns down the offer. However, a woman named Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) introduces something into Logan's body that makes him vulnerable. The next day, Yashida passes away and at the funeral, the Yakuza tries to kidnap Mariko, but Logan interjects and gets Mariko out of Tokyo. Logan and Mariko hide out in a house in Nagasaki. Meanwhile, Viper talks with Yashida bodyguard Harada (Will Yun Lee), who is forced to hunt Logan and Mariko down. The film deals with Logan dealing with the demons of his past, specifically seeing Jean in his hallucinations, and fighting with Viper and the Silver Samurai.<br/><br/>James Mangold does a great job with directing this and shows his talents with each scene, the cast, and handling the material. Mangold knows when the drama is necessary and when to keep the film exciting showing his excellence in directing a superhero movie. Like all films, there needs to be a great script and Mark Bomback and Scott Frank deliver with a great one that makes for one exciting Wolverine movie.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is great as always as Wolverine. Yet this time around, he is more interesting seeing him as a more vulnerable and human like character. He is also more relateable as someone with some demons in his past and trying to fight new ones. Rila Fukushima is interesting in her role as fellow mutant Yukio who fights alongside Wolverine and becomes a reliable asset. Tao Okamoto is also great in her role as Mariko, who is more than a damsel in distress and is someone who can fight, just not in the same way that Wolverine and Yukio do. I enjoyed seeing Famke Janssen return as Jean. She did what the role needed, but nothing more.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, I truly enjoyed the work with the camera by DP Ross Emery as it is some of the best camera work in a superhero movie. The production design by FranÃ§ois Audouy is very nice and had some very cool looking sets. Michael McCusker's editing is crisp and well put together. The sound design is quite enjoyable with the combination of dialog, the sound effects, and the combination of the exciting score by composer Marco Beltrami. The visual effects are also a feast for the eyes."
"trublu215","9","7","14","21 June 2014"," The Wolverine adaptation that fans deserve
","The Wolverine gives us more reason to take X-Men films more seriously. First Class restored our faith while this one solidifies it as a serious force of filmmaking brilliance. Under the direction of James Mangold, this marks the best X-Men film since X2 and vastly superior to the terrible X-Men Origins. The Wolverine pits our anti-hero against 21st century samurai in Japan while discovering the limitations of his mutant curse. This film is an absolute blast from start to finish. Mangold takes what Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughn laid out and turns it into his own, thus creating a whole other level to be reached for the next X-Men film. The film is paced awesomely and the story is very engaging, something that has somewhat plagued X-Men films from X2 on. This film fixes the wrongs and despite some plot holes here and there, this film is wildly entertaining. The action sequences are brutal, how Wolverine was meant to be seen. One thing Mangold does here is push the envelope. For a PG-13 film, this as close to an R rating as you can get. Wolverine was always meant to be seen as a savage character and as far as an on screen savage is concerned, this film does it right and isn't afraid to shy away from a bit of blood. The tone here is a lot darker than the originals, it is not meant to glorify anything here. We view Wolverine's world as he does, bleak, cold and brutal. Overall, The Wolverine is a fun, smart, action packed thriller that doesn't let up until the end credits roll. If you liked the other X-Men films, you'll absolutely LOVE this film."

This is a complete dud of a movie managing to be dull and full of American Stereotypes of Japanese, and probably at it's worst with cringe-worthy acting from most involved save Jackman. Most of the fault goes to the directors and script writers. This movie is a failure on several levels. It starts out promising enough with a quick montage from WWII supposedly, and then State-side, but degenerates badly when the main story starts, and the horrible dialog, direction, and acting that the Japanese actors have to put-in and up with. Like ""Pacific Rim"", it's more Asia-philia but without Rim's fun and spectacle. The action is mostly poor and weakly shot and realized. Jackman obviously got pumped up again, and the filmmakers overdo his shirt-less scenes, but I kept waiting for the movie to get more intense or infuse itself with energy, but it's pulse-less.

"mecheart","4","7","14","6 August 2013"," Will offend both comic book purists and intelligent fans of the Wolverine
","From what relevant personal background do I write this review? As a teen I was a reader of the related comics and although never a fanatic, realized a high degree of enjoyment from time spent with them. Beyond that, Wolverine is one of my favorite X-men although other than in the films of the last decade, I have not closely followed his story in art and print in over twenty years. Lastly, I am a fan of intelligent, adult themed action, sci-fi and horror films running on screenplays that require some degree of thought to understand - on the part of the viewer. I most enjoy films that engage me intellectually as well as visually.<br/><br/>Enter 'The Wolverine'. Based on reviews read around the net, I had planned on waiting for some time to see this film. Written opinions seemed to range from absolute enjoyment, to open hatred although positive reviews continue to outnumber the negative.<br/><br/>The opening scene and twenty minutes that follow it are very well written, acted and visualized - although Wolverine is not one of the most outwardly complex of characters to mimic. Much like scenes in other X-men and Wolverine movies, we find Logan living in the wild, haunted by one memory or the other drawn from the subconscious of very long lived individual. Logan has been around for over a century and perhaps more, so there is no shortage of internal strife from which to draw.<br/><br/>In my opinion, those opening scenes of act one were the best in the entire film, alongside perhaps a minute here or there later on in the running time.<br/><br/>What follows is an incredibly senseless plot acted out by too many factions the writers never fleshed out enough to either make us understand their roles, or cement the need for their existence in the first place. The film has Yakuza hit men - by the dozen who attack with relentless fury, then suddenly vanish for the rest of the story. It has Ninja assassins who hop and flip and do ninja stuff, but despite a tidbit of history and backstory to establish their relevance, they seem rather unnecessary to the story.<br/><br/>Several characters appear as well who like the Yakuza and Ninja, kind of fizzle out before having much impact on the plot. Essentially, I suspect the film makers simply wanted to show us what if - what if Wolverine encountered a Samurai, a Ninja, a battalion of Yakuza, etc.<br/><br/>Pertinent to our adamantium laced hero himself, the writers take great liberty with Logan's mutant powers - so much so that serious fans might leave the theater after viewing some of the more contrived or ridiculous modifications the film makers made to them. As stated above I am not a rabid fan of the comics, however I did walk away feeling a bit aggravated and perplexed by the situations Wolverine was put into, the uses of his abilities and his variety of reactions to tough situations. The Wolverine we have in this film, is not the Logan of the comics - not even close.<br/><br/>The plot, or rather the logic behind its unfolding events is quite the opposite of mature or intelligent. Many events occur which either do not make sense, do not connect sensibly with later sequences, or are simply abandoned without adequate explanation. In other words, I did not feel the need to reason out or ruminate much on the plot as it took place, and nothing that did happen really qualified as food for thought.<br/><br/>Of course some visually stunning movies can pull off the brainless, all eye candy method by overwhelming the viewer with scene upon scene of computer generated wizardry, or explosions or other such special effects. 'The Wolverine' fails here in that regard as well. A couple of action sequences were interesting, but I never found myself thrilled or on the edge of my seat. This is neither a thinking man's film nor a completely mindless CGI fest.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman pulls off Wolverine pretty well, but his is the only character in a film with many busy characters who spend extended time on screen with whom the viewer can connect. Most of the other characters are paper thin, their actions wholly unbelievable even for an alternate Earth where mutant superheroes exist.<br/><br/>Bottom line, any fan of the X-men, of Wolverine will naturally want to see 'The Wolverine'. I cannot blame them for that. However, is this film worth the price of admission or the time investment involved in driving to the theater, waiting in one or more lines, sitting through previews? I cannot agree that it is."

So many unnecessary scenes; from Jean Grey, to Viper-Lady (What was that about? reminds me of the Anime: Ninja Scroll with the Snake Lady Assassin shedding her skin), to fighting Yakuzas, to Hookers, to White Slavery, to running around everywhere, to Minjas? (And I love Ninjas too, just not in this garbage) What was the point of slicing off Wolverine's claws? I still don't get that part. They had a good villain like; Silver Samurai to challenge Wolverine, and Marvel, yet again, ruin it for all of us comic book purists out there, the same way Marvel ruined Iron Man 3 with the British/Hindu Mandarin. Jackman ""is"" Wolverine, but he needs to say something when the writing and directing does not make any sense, even for a comic book character. Do not waste your money on this B-Movie, borrow it from an associate or something, when it comes out on DVD."
"hallenbeck3","8","5","9","11 August 2016"," Great Adaptation
","For those wondering why this movie has such a low rating, it could be due to the fact that tons of reviews are a 3 out of 10 based on facts the reviewers missed when watching the movie. Tons and tons of reviews complain about plot holes, when said plot holes were addressed in the movie themselves and weren't really holes at all. So don't take the low rating to heart. <br/><br/>This movie has some amazing action and acting. You get to see the character of Logan lost and adrift, start to learn about what it means to exist in a world where all those around him are mortal and will die. The scenery is great, the acting is great and the story follows pretty well the comic to the screen. Are their differences, yes, quite a few. So if you are one of those types that can't appreciate the two mediums for being different and having to portray stories differently, then don't watch this movie. <br/><br/>Overall this movie has a great story that keeps you engrossed in the movie. You quite often can feel the anguish and loneliness that Logan feels. You also get to see The Wolverine as the lead, as the loner and as the bad ass he really is. You see him fight with who he really is and what he wishes he could be. For a comic movie, the story is much deeper than usual and makes for a great watch."

","Really enjoyed this movie. It is what it is and anyone who thinks they want to watch it because they are a fan of Wolverine or other Marvel Comics characters are going to be sated.<br/><br/>What I don't get are the poorly rated reviews. This thing delivered everything I had hoped for in this movie. And more. I'm not a big Marvel comic book fan. I'm more of a DC fan myself, but I've grown to love the Marvel Comics movies and they always... or almost always, deliver what I'm hoping for. Excitement, and all manor of drama without getting into the intimate sex lives of the characters but still delivering some of the angst of these characters past.<br/><br/>Like I said, I don't get the poor reviews. If you aren't the kind of person who likes this genre, why do you watch it then review it? I know I shouldn't critique reviews, but really... I place a lot of my leverage toward my viewing decisions based on these reviews.<br/><br/>Possible spoiler... I'll offer real fans this... Wolverine is faced with challenges he's never faced... including his mortality. That alone intrigued me. But the complex character interaction pleased me. I only hesitated in the foundational attachment with one of the primary characters. I really didn't get the strong attachment. I did suspend disbelief enough to really enjoy the movie. I only wonder where it will go henceforth."

Zero action, horrible story, made no sense, no explanation of characters, no reason to care for them or about them or anything in the movie really, just a horrid disappoint all around. I have lost all faith in any future Wolverine movies.<br/><br/>The story was predictable, easily. Wolverine was an idiot in the movie being taken down easily at times, with zero fight. There were so many stupid moments, so little explanation for what was happening, why it happened, why we should care, who was who. I wasn't expecting the best story, etc. I figured it would be worth watching for the action alone, but there was practically none, and nothing good that's for sure. No wonder they didn't show it in IMAX, it's not worth it. I would have rather watched Man of Steel again, or Pacific Rim again.<br/><br/>I will never watch this movie again.

Overall the only part of the movie that I really enjoyed was the last bit at the end after the credits. They had such a good log of back stories to follow on from, I just don't see how they could have came up with this end result and honestly thought it was the best they could do.

","I think this Wolverine meets all the expectations of a Hollywood action packed movie. Stunning visuals and great fight scenes all throughout, coupled with a gripping story. <br/><br/>Director James Mangold really managed to bring this comic book character and story to life, and Hugh Jackman was absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>In this film the Wolverine is verging on becoming mortal (as the trailer suggests, so this is NOT a spoiler) so Jackman is not the usual invincible superhero we're used to seeing. This makes the story really interesting and keeps you constantly on edge.

","I had high expectations going into this movie I love the character Wolverine and Hugh Jackman plays him perfectly. So going in I knew that there was a chance that I would be disappointed but that was not the case. I really loved the Wolverine.<br/><br/>At first I was disappointed that we never saw how Wolverine got his memory back but I don't mind assuming that over time they came back maybe through his constant nightmares every night. Aside from that the only thing about this movie that bummed me out was that when Wolverine threw that guy off the balcony and he landed in a pool. Even though he did not know there was a pool there I could not help but think that would have been so much cooler and fitting for the character and tone of the movie if the pool had not been there.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the lack of mutants like some people have in fact I liked that because that allowed the movie to focus completely on Wolverine. All of the characters in the Wolverine were really good they all did what they needed to do in the movie as well as help to tell the story of The Wolverine.<br/><br/>So thats about all I have to say. The Wolverine was a great and really fun summer movie. Don't listen to the negative reviews at least not until you have seen the movie for yourself.<br/><br/>Even with those 2 little disappointments the more I think about it the more a realize that I still think overall...<br/><br/>The wolverine deserves a 10/10"

I'm a huge fan of Hugh Jackman and all his films. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is awesome specially when he fights with samurai skills. Jackman is playing well his role as Logan putting all his senses to represent the character ""The Wolverine"". The film shows the real meanings of honor, bravery and insist of fighting to the end. I liked the story.<br/><br/>The most shocking part, after the credits, the film shows Logan after two years seeing his old enemy ""Magneto"" and his old Professor ""Charles Xavier"" (whom he thought they're dead).<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10/10 because I never wanted an end to the story, I'm waiting to the sequel."
"azhark14","3","6","12","26 August 2013"," What a shame - Worst of the X Men Series
","Such a shame. Was really looking for this, but it has really been poor.I think the last Wolverine movie was given some harsh reviews by many people - but this is relative. People say they want to know about Wolverine and less about the X men. if this is the case then this film could be a better film than the first.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT START) HOWEVER. How can you possibly have only two other mutants in the full film when Wolverine at the end of the day is one of the X Men. And weak mutants at that. In this respect this film is so much worse than the origins film and I wished that the director had not changed.<br/><br/>And what a load of rubbish, that a super-machine with all powers is the ultimate enemy/villain. <br/><br/>The film starts brilliantly with reference back to Nagasacki bombings and you think for a moment, this could be a real clue to Wolverines life but its far from it unfortunately. And what the heck happened at the end --film has made a blunder!!! because surely Magneto has lost his powers as shown in the Last Stand film. However he returns with them, but hang on that cant be possible because this film is set in the current era, with Japanese technology and fast flashy cars quite evident to say that the time-frame is 2010 onwards at least. <br/><br/>SPOILER ENDED<br/><br/>The film has not been true to other X men films so feels wish washy. Some of the scenes stunts and fight scenes are spectacular but overall storyline is weak. If you're a a hardcore X Men fan you will be disappointed by the lack of X men in this movie.<br/><br/>Disappointing."
"prashantkhatana","2","6","12","8 August 2013"," Missing the 'X' factor totally!!
","The very thought of Wolverine going to Japan to visit a Japanese Samurai raised the bar of expectations so high and then the movie effortlessly slashed all those hopes with the swiftness of a Samurai Sword. The story line of movie as projected in the trailers and print media was so exciting, but the execution of the same was so poor. It seems the script writers have not only never visited Japan, they have not even read about the Great Samurais and their culture. I have to say that this movie has just special effects to offer and nothing else, but then every other movie has such 'mind-boggling' special effects and some even better. <br/><br/>A story involving, Wolverine who is a relentless warrior himself, going to Japan to meet a Samurai could have been so spectacular with great possibilities and laced with special effects the movie could have been path-breaking and inspiration to other movies. But that was not to be. <br/><br/>The movie, I think totally misses the point, as it miserably fails to appreciate the fact that Japan and Samurais are all about a great culture and a movie based in Japan and involving Samurais cannot avoid to inculcate the same. On the other hand, this movie has no great mutants either, just one antagonist apart from the wolverine. so the movie not only lacks The real Japan and real Samurais, it also lacks the real X-men. I think this movie is a totally failure on every front, apart from the special effects. Special effects are good, but special effects alone cannot save a movie that rides on the hype of Wolverine and the stupendous success of earlier 'X-Men' movies. <br/><br/>I think the franchise needs to rethink before they embark on another 'Wolverine' movie. Hype alone cannot take you far!!<br/><br/>Three stars only for special effects. Don't waste your time, unless you are a die-hard wolverine fan."
"koen_smit","4","6","12","31 July 2013"," Too slow, boring and not a good story
","There's so much wrong with this picture that I don't really know where to start. Okay, I will start at the beginning. Logan saves a Japanese guy (Yashida) from the Nagasaki bombing. Although we do not know why Logan was there imprisoned at that time. In X-Men Origins – Wolverine, he was fighting in France in WW2 together with Victor (Sabretooth) and after that in Vietnam. Now D-Day was indeed a year before the Nagasaki bombing, so Logan could have been there, but then where is Sabretooth. It turns out to be a dream (within a dream) but they sell it as a memory that is a heavy burden for Logan. Also why Yashida freed him is totally unclear as Logan is a part of the enemy, bombing his city.<br/><br/>After he wakes up from the real dream the story develops extremely slow and it takes for about 20 minutes before something action-wise happens. For an action movie this takes way too long and I could not help finding myself yawning at some time. Some characters are introduced here that do not have any use for the plot (like the fiancée of the granddaughter). Once we have had some action at the funeral of Yashida and Logan trying to save his granddaughter we get back into the coma as before. Logan discovers in the train ride away from the city he is not healing like he used to and at that time I was thinking the director must have been worried too without knowing what to do about the pace of the movie. <br/><br/>The next action sequence in and on top of the train gave me a little hope this movie was just starting really slow and from that point would become the usual roller-coaster towards the end. But no, we dive back into that same coma again, this time for at least another 20 minutes. Then I was too bored to care about the story anymore. <br/><br/>Of course the fiancée turns out to be an asshole (that's how he was introduced so no surprises there, not that it had anything to do with the movie), just like the father, the evil Viper doctor is really evil (really? Yes really) and for someone so strong and powerful with toxic nails, breath and spit she dies extremely quick. And why the old love of the granddaughter supports the Viper doctor and what turns out to be a not so dead Yashida riddles me. Didn't he vow to protect her? Well, any child could tell he was playing for the wrong team to do that! You would expect a ninja to do so too. And why did Yashiba want to take the healing from Logan when he didn't want to give it ? Logan was only protecting his one true heir, his granddaughter.<br/><br/>No I think this movie missed a good team of writers and a great director. This was a failure for me. The acting is okay, the sfx are okay, but it misses everything a great action movie should have: a heart and soul. And then I did not mention yet that you have seen all the action already in the trailer."
"kurtjrkai","4","6","12","27 July 2013"," not horribly done. lots of plot holes left unanswered. But overall it was better then it's predecessor.
","so, let me start by saying that this movie was not horrible. There were a lot of elements about the movie the were very well done. All of the action scenes were top notch and very well done, and Yukio was pretty amazing.<br/><br/>The movie started off really well the whole beginning scene in japan with the war was really good, as well as the scenes in America. The movie fell short when he went to japan and ran around for an hour. one. The relationship between mariko and wolverine was not needed, it was ill conceived and unnecessary. two. I'm surprised Logan remembers anything pre adamantium with his experiments with stryker. Three. You don't get to know any of the characters very well, bad character development. Four. Yashidas plan is not planned out well. Five. The story line didn't move forward well apart from all the fight scenes and multiple flash backs of Jean Grey. I could probably keep going on.......<br/><br/>Yet again a stand alone Wolverine fell short, but at least it was better then its predecessor, x-men origins. Huegh Jackman/Wolverine is better off with the x-men teamed up with him. I enjoyed the x-men movies and I am definitely looking forward to days of future past."
"absynthek5","9","4","7","5 January 2014"," Kick Arse (not for those not familiar with the comics)
","First and foremost Hugh Jackman is the man. I certainly hope no one ever tries to replace him.<br/><br/>Movie: SPOILER ALERT! Those who have not seen the movie please do not read further. --------<br/><br/>Fans of the comic will get this movie and true fans of the Wolverine will love it also. Most of the reviews I have read so far seem to be placed by folks who really don't care or know about Logan's past. <br/><br/>Much like Magneto's ability in the first movie to neutralize the wolverine a mutant in this movie found a way to suppress Logan's healing ability. Many folks saw what they thought were holes in the movie thinking that his healing was stopped but they it was only suppressed by an artificial organism. You would have to assume that when viper programmed the organism she had it allow Logan to benefit from just enough healing to keep him alive through his ordeal to ensure he would make it to the meeting. <br/><br/>Also saw someone complaining about seeing Logan getting tired and taking a beating but this is all a good thing. The loss of the gift showed him how vulnerable he would be if he chose to be normal again. This also allowed us the viewer to get on the edge of our seat knowing our favorite bad ass was taking a whooping and while he came out on top of most of the fights he was worse for the wear.<br/><br/>Another reviewer also complained about the blade cutting off Wolverine's claws. It was obvious that much research had been done by Yashida when creating his Samurai. I would have to assume they calculated how hot those blades needed to be heated to melt/slice through Wolverine's claws. While I hate, and I mean absolutely hate seeing this whole part it goes to show you that even the best of bad ass can run into someone superior from time to time. I just wish somehow his claws got fixed, the bone just doesn't cut it!<br/><br/>Anyhoo, in conclusion the movie was a nail biter if you only vaguely remember the comic series. I felt it was great to show more of the Wolverine's background and put him in a place where he was vulnerable. He also got over Jean and decided to go back to whoopin arse which we all truly want anyway! Everyone has to hit a crossroad like this and it was very nice to see.<br/><br/>I went 9 of 10 because there is always room for improvement and well add another 2 hours to the movie!"

Svetlana Khodchenkova was also an interesting choice for playing Viper. And while we are on the Viper character, then that was an interesting character, and it was a shame that she wasn't really given more on-screen time.<br/><br/>Effects-wise then ""The Wolverine"" does it quite nice. It uses enough effects and CGI to keep the movie fresh and interesting, without overdoing it and turning it into a CGI special effects galore and putting the actual story in the background.<br/><br/>Whereas the previous movies set in the X-Men universe have been rather stereotypical in terms of superhero movies go, then ""The Wolverine"" takes a turn for a more mature approach and appeals to an audience that are actually well out of their teenage years.<br/><br/>""The Wolverine"" provides good entertainment, regardless of whether or not you are familiar with the main character."
"JamesMitchell451","8","7","15","12 August 2013"," The Wolverine delivers
","The last movie staring Wolverine was awful. So imagine my surprise when I heard they were making a sequel. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to not only be a great film, but the best superhero film of the summer. Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine in this sequel to the member of the X- Men's first solo outing. Mark Bomback and The Usual Suspects' Christopher McQuarrie penned the script, which takes its inspiration from the Chris Claremont/Frank Miller Marvel miniseries from the 1980s dealing with the character's adventures in Japan as he fights ninjas in the ceremonial garb of the samurai. Knight and Day's James Mangold directs. (Jeremy Wheeler, Rovi) The Story here is overall pretty good, despite a few plot holes it is well told, and it is delivered in a stylish and cool way. It is more than just a straightforward action film, The Wolverine is the study of Logan. The study of a man who has lived for over a century, who hasn't aged at all while he has watched those he has loved wither away and die, and a man who has killed the one person he loves most. The script is really well done, a surprise considering the biggest problem with X-Men Origins was indeed the script. The dialogue is quirky, funny, and natural. The acting here is top notch. Everyone here gives good performances, but the star of the movie is Hugh Jackman, who proves he is still THE WOLVERINE, he gives what is easily the best performance of his career. The action, despite some shaky cam that annoyed me, is great. There is a fight scene on a moving bullet train that is easily the best action sequence in the X-Men film series' history. The Wolverine is a great surprise. It is well acted, well directed, beautifully shot, and is easily the best superhero movie of the summer. And take my advice: STAY AFTER THE CREDITS. There is something there that easily made me give the movie points, and while I won't spoil what it is, I can say this: X-Men Days Of Future Past can't come soon enough."

You don't have feelings for any of the characters they are hollow. After a while when I was trying to keep my eyes open the only taught I had was ""Plz end this please end this even if it kills Wolverine"".

","Before I continue I would like to apologize for any spoiler alerts that may escape my fingers. I truly try to avoid them, but sometimes those sly fellas just slip through.<br/><br/>This story kicks off where the events from X-men: Last Stand end and while I have deep respect for 'The X-men' series, (there's just something about watching the whole bunch of misfits together, seeing how they complement one another, that keeps me loving them) the Wolverine films have failed to really deliver to me!<br/><br/>It's no news that Wolverine has always been the standout character of the bunch; always a loner and possessing plenty of history and personal baggage, the character was bound to be the breakout star from the bunch. Unfortunately for him however, the stand alone films still haven't gotten it right, and in my opinion, I think they should stop trying. E don do.<br/><br/>The beautiful thing about the X-men is that they are the X-men and no matter how outstanding Logan's story is or how good he looks shirtless or the skills he possesses with those claws, it's just not interesting to watch him alone.<br/><br/>It's bad enough that almost every X-men film is tied to a back-story that revolves around him, but to give us basically the same kind of story without the other members of Prof. Xavier's team does not seem to be working! It's also quite sad that the broody story-line they have been trying to pour down our throats lacks the depth that has made movies like the Dark Knight or Watchmen outstanding. (No, the dreams do not count thank you very much!)<br/><br/>Some claim it's the fact that Fox acquired the licence to the X-men movies and have put inadequate writers to the task of helming the movies but I say even with that, it just does not seem fun to watch Logan brood over the events in X-men: The Last Stand, then get drawn into a story that is not only average but highly convoluted (and I don't mean the good kind).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Logan is still very much his brutal self, handing out some major butt-kicking to very deserving opponents and its amazing how much of this he does as a mortal man ridden with bullets, so I will not complain, what I would do is advice you not to go into the movie expecting too much.<br/><br/>It is definitely a much better film than Origins but the story is boring, the delivery average, the fighting kinda O.K (well maybe more than O.K), and the twist somewhat predictable. <br/><br/>Why then should you go and watch the film, well 'cos it's a summer blockbuster and I'm sure you'll want to have an opinion when others are talking about the film; also because the end credits is the best thing about the film. So take some time out and watch it to see if you think all I've written is bull crap.<br/><br/>I assure you, it's not."

It didn't give anything we haven't already seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>The opening scene was evoking and the film did come together well at the end. <br/><br/>I preferred X-Men Origins.

","Cliché princess in a castle (literally, except it's a Japanese one), and awkward acting by the two female Japanese actors. <br/><br/>The princess in a castle plot was so blatantly obvious that it would have been better to just rub it in the viewer's face. I mean, really. They could have done better than just the lone knight moving determinedly towards the castle; not to mention that the Wolverine calls Mariko ""princess"". <br/><br/>The movie is also a stereotypical picture of Japan and its men and women. We get it that the Japanese have their sword-in-your-own-gut suicides and the women are all stereotypical obedient housewives who actually can turn into screaming ninjas and kill you with a sword. WE GET IT. Enough of these people obsessing over their historical culture and ENOUGH WITH THE NINJAS. ENOUGH WITH THE NINJAS PLEASE. Every country in the world had professional assassins that covered themselves in black to sneak in and kill people. EVERY COUNTRY HAD ASSASSINS DRESSED IN BLACK. Why can't we just call them assassins? or spies? Great Britain has the MI6, with their spies dressed in black suits. Are we gonna start calling them ninjas too? The Japanese government is trying to claim that anything and everything came from their island. They claim that their neighboring countries' land is theirs as well the sea and stuff from other countries. They could very well claim that the British got their ideas of James Bond from them. They did it to China and Korea's islands and archaeological finds. Please do not let them copyright men wearing black tights as ""ninjas"". I prefer not to create any more words than necessary. We already have the word ""assassin"". <br/><br/>I thought the so-called ""love hotels"" were a bit exaggerated, but it turns out it wasn't so. Japan has tons of them in cities - and YES, with those hilarious themed rooms. It was funny until I found out it was real; then it just became weird. I mean sex and making out is already perfect on its own without having to do it in a room with fake moon- rocks and a space shuttle theme. We get that Japan has its own thing going on, and it's nothing special; we all have that weird kid in class who like to guzzle ketchup or sniff glue. THEY are that kid. We just have to wait until they grow out of it - which they are starting to - and turn into sensible global citizens. I just don't need it to be shoved in my face, like how I don't like it when people guzzle ketchup in front of me. <br/><br/>Moving on to the acting. I thought the male Japanese actors did well, some of the antagonists acted brilliantly! The female Japanese actors, on the other hand, were HORRIBLE. They acted natural when they spoke Japanese, but when they did their lines in English, it was REALLY AWKWARD. I had to squirm in my seat to avoid looking at the screen because their awkward lines made ME awkward. Can't they have used Japanese-American actors? Maybe the director was aiming for authenticity in their accents, but what he hit was failure. After seeing the Japanese female actor in ""Pacific Rim"", I thought I would never see more awkward acting than her - but they did it. Congratulations. <br/><br/>Overall, I would give the movie a 3/10. The only reason I give the three stars is because the male actors in the movie did good acting; the awkward lines and acting from the female Japanese acting was what took out three stars, the cliché plot took out the four."

","The plot is dumb, all right. Bringing up a made-up story just so you could make another Wolverine movie to generate triple the amount you spend is the latest trend in Hollywood. But, if you are an X-Men follower there are two things you may wanna watch out, once it comes out in rentals: the thing they do with Logan & the post-credit scene.<br/><br/>Starting off with a bearded Hugh Jackman, the plot takes you back to the Nagasaki bombing. We know he is immortal; lands up in Japan and gets entangled in a series of ridiculous action sequences, I suspect, which were voluntarily. Then, we have few Japanese women he befriends and manages to go beyond, which makes no sense at all for a character so harsh & bold. The climax is a cheap attempt at a twist which hardly works for the movie. Other characters were poorly directed and the scene they acted in gave me an impression of unfathomable continuity. The villainy lacks vindictiveness. Trust me, the 2 hours of monotony just leads to you-know-what!<br/><br/>And there is not much of the visual effects to write about. Action sequences are very good, but come on, now we require something inventive and spine-chilling.

","This is a potentially career-killing film.<br/><br/>I don't know where to begin, except to say that the production quality of the film is evidently lacking. It feels like a bad TV movie of the week.<br/><br/>The film is strangely quiet, and lacking a musical score. The dialogue which attempts to replace it, fails miserably. The film plods along, taking seemingly forever to get to the end.<br/><br/>Another problem is that Wolverine has no charm. His lines are all wooden and emotionless. Honestly, while I like Hugh Jackman, I never thought he made a good Wolverine. The comic character was more heavy set physically, and less of a gentleman.<br/><br/>No one can seriously claim that ""Wolverine"" is a good movie. Marvel should aim a lot higher."
"axlastro2","6","5","10","7 November 2013"," Could have been better
","I'm not really good with reviews so I'll just share my thoughts. <br/><br/>I loved the way the movie started and that was about it. Die hard Wolverine fans will probably like it more, but I think X-men movies are much more interesting. Hugh Jackman plays the role great and I can't imagine another actor replacing him. The fight scenes were also very entertaining and well choreographed, but there was something missing (more mutants?) and I don't know what. There were a bit too much cliché's both plot and character - wise too.<br/><br/>That said - I would gladly watch another Wolverine movie and hope it turns out better than this one. I would recommend the movie, but don't expect ""A man of steel"" awesome effects and dramatic storyline. Just grab some popcorn and enjoy, BUB!"

","This is Hollywood's second attempt to create a movie solely based on the character of Wolverine. (If you don't count the 3 X-Men movies).<br/><br/>Jokes aside, this movie came of pretty disappointing. We've related to Wolverine before. We tried to follow his story, We felt his fears, tasted his determination, and felt his rage. It was my opinion that the X-Men movies and origins accomplished this pretty well.<br/><br/>Now why did they make another one of those? You could just say Hollywood milking of a franchise or a concept, but it seems to be further than that. We do not need to explore this character any further. Been there, done that. We need a real X-Men story, with more characters, different mutants and more complicated plots.The character was portrayed pretty well, but it went as far as it could go. <br/><br/>Oh and if you haven't seen this movie yet, it does get entertaining for a while, but it turns into real schlock in the end. Be warned.<br/><br/>Overall, well made movie, but poorly written, un-reletable, dull and uninventive. If you want some decent action, go see it. For anything more, I wouldn't bother. But hey, I'm just some guy on the internet..."
"riddion","2","6","13","5 August 2013"," What a mess!
","I have just seen this for the second time in the hope of it making more sense the second time around. It does not.<br/><br/>I tried to view it like one of characters wasn't quite what he/she appeared to be, but it didn't help. <br/><br/>The plot of this is drivel from about 20% into it. The first 20% was interesting where we just saw Logan coping with what happened and what he did in X-men 3. When he arrives in Japan the movie bogs down to drivel. <br/><br/>It has action sequences that doesn't make sense with uninteresting people. There is one exception to this. One character is interesting, Yukio. She is the only one that displays any real sense of having a past, and being a real character with her own emotions and sense of self. <br/><br/>The plot doesn't make any sense what so ever, even the second time watching it. So when the movie moves towards the climax of the story it so uninteresting that I was about to sleep. And by the time the main bad guy has the final showdown with Wolverine it is very predictable how this is going to end.<br/><br/>Actually the most interesting scene in the entire movie is at the very end, after the main plot has been concluded, when we see a couple of familiar characters from previous X-men movies in an airport. This little scene has more fire and more character that it seems to be written and directed by other people than the movie proper.<br/><br/>I would most definitely say that this is the worst of the X-men movies. Even Origins: Wolverine is better than this. With the other Marvel movies, like Avengers, Captain America and Iron Man, and DC's Dark Knight Trilogy we know by now that superhero movies can be really great.<br/><br/>I would not recommend anyone watching this piece of nonsense."
"zetes","5","6","13","4 August 2013"," A bore
","Hugh Jackman is fine in the role, as always, and some of the action sequences are good (though I hated the fight on top of the bullet train - it struck me as incredibly stupid), but the story is fairly cliché and there's just no flow. The story has Wolverine summoned to Japan to say goodbye to an old acquaintance whose life he saved in WWII (Hal Yamanouchi). There he gets pulled into a web of intrigue and ninjas. Rila Fukushima provides able support as a red haired martial artist with superior sword skills. Tao Okamoto is pretty but dull as the love interest. Svetlana Khodchenkova is embarrassingly bad as a prostitute, er, doctor who is also not very secretly an evil mutant. She feels way out of place. Marvel has done such a good job with their Avengers franchise, and the last X-Men movie was pretty good, but this is a dud. A lot of the critics who liked it liked it specifically because it separated this hero from his milieu, and I think that's partly why I didn't like it much at all."

But going with big hope and waiting than something will happen it is better to go and watch he previous one. Writing down here any more it's look like waste of time i don't know why Hollywood is going to Asian countries for making any sequels. The best part in this movie is when the movie ends because after the credits gone there is a big surprise for every X MEN movie lover so if it is possible you can forward the whole movie just go in the end. With some loose action sequences and little bit twist in the end i does not understand what people see in this movie as we are getting this high rating.

There's also another who is sort of his guardian. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a thrilling trip in the Land of the Rising Sun especially when it takes us to the top of a moving train. There's also some nice quiet scenes between the granddaughter and Logan. This was quite a thrill to watch especially in 3-D. So on that note, I highly recommend The Wolverine!"

The films focus on Logan saving the life of young Yashida and in return he wants to take Logan's healing ability.

Viper did great but she didn't shine well in this one, I really expect from her. And as for Wolverine, this Wolverine is a badass Wolverine ever. I like how they change his attitude and put some bit of dark character on him. The story was amazing, too much surprises but still it has dead scenes probably 60% of it were conversation and 40% fighting scenes. Yeah, at some point it's boring but when it comes on fighting scenes, it will make you jump on your sits and it was hell amazing. <br/><br/>(Spoilers Alert)<br/><br/>Yashida successfully got Wolverines healing factor by sucking the Adamantium on his claws but he died eventually. Now, we will go to see Wolverine with his original bone claws in the future film which leads to my idea the reason why they put young Stryker on it. Logan set Jean free and let her go from nightmares that haunt him.<br/><br/>I will going to confess that the after credit was the only reason I'm so excited to see the film. So, 2 years after the events of ""The Wolverine"", Logan comes back to US and met Magneto and Professor X there which telling him that a mutant threat has been planned to wipe the mutant race forever. Trask Industry can be seen in the commercial from the screen of the airport which totally leads to X-men: Days of Future Past.<br/><br/>It was a good movie but not the best but more perfect than X-men Origins: Wolverine.

I can't say the story is great: it is actually quite overused I felt like I have seen it in other movies. The conversations are very trivial, unlike its predecessors X-Men Origins and the X-Men films. Yet these aspects didn't prevent me from sitting until the end of the credits, because first of all, I am a big fan of Wolverine and the X- Men, which are among the few superhero characters I haven't outgrown yet and probably, will not. Second, the movie proved to be very entertaining in every manner. The visual effects, the fight scenes, and the cinematography are outstanding. The Wolverine's superb caliber makes up for its lack of witty dialogs and excellent script.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman demonstrated once more that he is indeed the only man who possesses the right to be Wolverine. The supporting Japanese characters added humor, drama, and thrill to the movie. Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova spiced up the movie with her maleficent character. Famke Janssen's small but pivotal role as Jean Grey added vulnerability to the Wolverine character and to the movie itself. James Mangold turned The Wolverine into an explosive and impressive movie.<br/><br/>Overall, The Wolverine is a perfect movie for X-Men fans and explosive and entertaining movie seekers."

Going to Japan is a very interesting move for his character. His loner mentality is perfect there. I really like the first half. It has great action and some fitting humor. It also has good intrigue. The second half does take a break. I'm not impressed with Tao Okamoto's acting. She has one tone and her character lacks energy. On the other hand, I really like Rila Fukushima. She exudes energy and has more fun in her character. She's a good sidekick to Wolverine. The final battle do drag on a little too long.

Wolverine life is full with conflict, which is very Natural (don't ever expect a hero with a perfect life). 2. This Movie show that, although he is a superhero but he still have a weakness (Man of Steel almost not have a weakness except kryptonite, which is boring. Kal-el and general Zod punching each other, but with the same level of power they didn't ever bleeding). 3. The acting is so natural for me - Some people said that the Japanese actor language is very awkward, but the fact is that is the reality and perfect English for Japanese people may look this film is just like full American Film (examples with Kryptonian, is very weird to see an alien to use English, when did they learn English and why should they learn, they have they own language) 4. 60% Story and 40% Action, so what do you expect? Just an action movie without story?Punching and killing people without known the reason? A hurting heroesstill need to recovery and it's very Natural. 5. Jean Grey is Annoying,Yeah I'm agree it's very annoying, but then I'm realize, I have thesame problem with him, haunted by a past. and it's very annoying. andwe know what the reason is. 6. A hero doesn't always use a marvelous costume. Yes, is better than a superhero that used a costume from nowhere and the most awkward is the costume is perfectly fit on the user body sized, it seems like they know the hero body will be taller and mass, how about if it short or thin? 7. This is the hero without a mask or alter ego. just being himself.<br/><br/>Some people said it's a messed movie, but for me this is the way a superhero movie has to be. Rate 10/10"

","Great Marvel film, little logos of all of your fav characters are hidden through out all of the colour, and flash. I liked the movie, even though in these early copies there are no subs. you lose about 20% of the verbage, but it is a comic book, so the scene tells the story as much as the words in it. Also I think that the director must have thought if Logan can't understand them, then why should you. The Full screen always has something in it, even when it is just a distraction, and completely unnecessary. This is a great first movie for a person not familiar with any of the Marvel Universe, but for anyone else it is a confusing mess, Viper should have been Typhoid Mary, and the whole story itself was supposed to have happened years ago, yet the time lies around him don't seem to fit. (the end clip I don't want to ruin, it is just not right) So much better than the first movie, this is comparable to the difference between Xmen 2 or 3, against the First Class movie. Just so much better made, and the quality of effects is way above the other. Still though a jumbled mess it may be, but taken on it's own as a movie one off, then ""Wow what a great movie, I have never seen such amazing stunt work, and those actors are all so new, and never seen before in other films, and like OMG did you see that Wolverine guy he can heal..."" 'Nuff uh that bub. You know for a guy who must have been alive for hundreds, or even thousands of years, created by the Nords, or the Huns, or the Spartans, or the Argonauts maybe he could even be Hercules, or an original, yet for all of that he sure has seemed to take quite the shining to the ol' American way of life.

Be nice if film makers would stop having their idiot camera men run down the street, jump over objects and crawl over broken glass when they were filming action scenes. They totally suck. As for the plot, everyone is trying to kill the girl Wolverine decides to protect.

"bravesfanc","8","4","8","29 July 2013"," Awesome
","While I have never read a comic in my life, I have always found the movies entertaining. Some, more than others and this might be the one I enjoyed the most, with the exception of ""The Avengers"".<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as ""Wolverine"" has always, in my opinion, been the best character brought on screen in the ""X-Men"" movies. I had no expectations going into this movie, my only hope was that it was better than ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". And personally I thought this was a lot better.<br/><br/>For starters, there wasn't as many ""mutant"" characters. In ""Origins"" it felt like they pushed all these different characters into the movie just for the sake of having them there. This movie felt more real, with real people who had emotions. The Asian cast was fantastic as well. They won't be well known, with the exception of Hiroyuki Sanada who as been in a few Hollywood movies, most notably, ""The Last Samurai"".<br/><br/>I also liked the fight scenes more because it was more hand to hand combat as well as sword fighting. Being half Japanese, I really enjoy the use of samurai swords and it was a great, but too short, fight scene between Wolverine and Sanada's character.<br/><br/>The one problem that I find with the X-Men movies is the continuity of them all. For example, (spoiler alert) at the end of Origins, Wolverine is shot and loses his memory. The first scene of this movie takes place before the events in Origins. Fast forward to present day after the events of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"". Which means when the Japanese commander sends someone to find him so he can say goodbye before his death, Wolverine shouldn't remember who he is, but he does and remembers those events. Then again, since it ends up being his dream, maybe that's the way he begins to get his memory back.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait for the next X-Men movie. Which reminds me to stay through the end credits to see a very tantalizing scene which leads up to the next movie. Bottom line, see it!"
"Faber-2","10","6","14","2 December 2013"," The character of Yukio was amazing.
","I went to see The Wolverine expecting to see some sword fighting and martial arts fighting by the women. I was not disappointed. I especially liked the character of Yukio who was played by Rila Fukushima. I think she was just as good in the film as the Wolverine or Logan. She is smart, witty, funny, and has a great personality. She also doesn't just use her sword, but can fight as well. She has martial arts ability. She seems to enjoy her human abilities and capabilities much more than her precognitive mutant abilities. I recommend this movie if you want to see a lot of strong female characters. I've liked the x men series because all the female characters have something to offer. They are all beautiful and have something to offer in each film, at least that I can remember. Whether they have some mutant capability or not. I would recommend purchasing this film to see the character of Yukio and I don't think you will feel disappointed in what I say. Especially if you like strong female supporting roles."

Hugh Jackman and beautiful Tao Okamoto in the main roles did their job the best that ones could've done. <br/><br/>There's no movie to compare it with. E.g. New Batman movies are too realistic and serious for a superhero movies.

At first I was excited that this was filmed with an Asian heavy cast, but it quickly turned into a disappointment. Asian women are depicted as submissive, weak, and easily fall for white men.

Save your money and wait for Blue Ray. It's mildly entertaining some good action but no where near enough to keep you from dozing off in the middle. I had fun laughing at it with my friends, suppose that's a plus."
"sowyau","2","6","14","28 July 2013"," Wolverine / Logan goes solo for the 2nd time
","The man with the adamantium skeleton is back. No ""X-Men"" word in the title, just his name, Wolverine AKA Logan goes solo for the second time after X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Hood, 2009). The comic story arc of Wolverine in Japan is well known among X-Men-philes. So expect to see Katana wielding samurai and ninjas.<br/><br/>The prologue shows Logan being held captive by the Japanese troops in Nagasaki during WW2. The American B-52 bomber was coming to drop the A-Bomb, he saved Yashida's life, a Japanese soldier. Switching back to current time, we see Logan had nightmares about his former lover Jean Grey (Famkee Janssen returned, remind me of the creepy Leonardo Di Caprio character's wife in Nolan's Inception). The remorse Logan is haunted by his past, the guilt consumes him in many ways. He went for secluded life in the wild, this is where the plot picks up after the event in X-Men: The Last Stand (Ratner, 2006).<br/><br/>This fish-out-of-water plot shows how Logan is called upon to bid farewell to his long time friend, a dying old man Yashida, who he saved half a century ago. Yashida is grateful for Logan's deed and wants to repay him by offering something that everyone has, except him: Mortality. The so called mortality curse possessed by Logan has already been made clear in the previous X-Men Origins movie. The idea of wiping off the Wolverine's memory is essentially the same as ending his life. Things get knotty when Yashida's grand daughter, Mariko is hunted by Yakuza gangs, this is where Wolverine cross swords (or cross swords with claws for that matter) with his opponents.<br/><br/>If there is one movie the bankable star Hugh Jackman guarantee to carry a movie on his own, it is the portrayal of the resentful feral mutant which makes him always watchable. From the three X-men movies, to the spin-off X-Men Origins: Wolverine, down to the eye catching cameo appearance in prequel X-Men: First Class. Having said that, in this latest chapter, the lack of memorable supporting casts and the decent script let him down big time. Logan's supposedly love interest, Mariko, besides he saves her from suicide and escape with her during the funeral scene, where is their sudden mutual affection coming from? Pure bad writing, period. Then there is the red-haired Yukio, bodyguard (do not ask me why) of Logan, who serves little purpose in the movie.<br/><br/>I will not be the minority who think Logan fighting with the gun-trotting Yakuza members is not as exciting as fighting with another equally matched mutants, is it? The lack of worthy villains soften the intensity factor. The blonde who played the forked tongue mutant, who I reckon her special ability is ..... spreading disease (?) and superhuman strength (?), hardly a third tier X-Men character in special power hierarchy. Are we suppose to believe she can challenge Wolverine's superiority? Then there is this finale's villain (the name I should remain a secret) disinterested me by the time the plot got to there.<br/><br/>The funeral set piece is one of the highlights and the prologue is the best scene in the entire movie, it just went down hill afterwards. The plot does not bring anything new to the table, aside from he is in a culturally different territory and temporary loses the self-healing power. I yawned as much as Wolverine's adamantium claws pop out from his fists throughout the movie. As far as a X-Men theme movie goes, I am surprise by the bland effort.<br/><br/>My movie review at www.sowyau.blogspot.com/"

"sanddragon939","9","6","14","26 July 2013"," A well-deserved Japanese vacation for the Wolverine!
","'X-men Origins Wolverine' was an entertaining film, admittedly, but it was a deeply flawed movie that ultimately didn't do the character or his origin story enough justice. 'The Wolverine', Fox's (and Hugh Jackman's) second attempt to give the character a solo adventure, does rectify a lot of those flaws, and ends up as a good film (maybe even a very good one)...but it just falls short of 'great'.<br/><br/>The movie undoubtedly has its strengths. It treats the character and the source material seriously, adopting a dark noir-ish tone befitting Wolverine and more specifically the 'Japanese saga' it is based on. Logan's inner struggle with his immortality, and his lack of purpose, are perfectly illustrated, and resolved. The supporting cast, including the members of the Yashida clan (Master Yashida, Shingen and Mariko), Harada, and of course, Yukio, are near-perfect. Viper proves to be a chilling antagonist (though nowhere near the level of Brian Cox's William Stryker, Ian McKellan's Magneto, or even Liev Schreiber's Victor Creed!) The cinematography is breath-taking-from the opening scenes in the Canadian wilderness to the alleyways of Tokyo. <br/><br/>But where the movie disappoints, to a large extent, is in its plot structure. What could have been an pure atmospheric Japanese noir drama/action flick, ends up getting 'polluted' with clichÃ©d superhero and thriller tropes such as lost superpowers, 'secret identities' and 'surprise' twists. Instead of being the definitive Wolverine story, this movie ends up being a darn good superhero story...but certainly nothing close to the likes of The Dark Knight or The Avengers."

","There are bad edit points, disappearing props, plot holes. @Rila Fukushima (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3822462/?ref_=rvi_nm) brings it & I feel sorry for Hugh Jackman for trying to rescue this. Do NOT go to see this in 3D.<br/><br/>We noticed every possible mistake.. the teaser during the credits is one of the only saving aspects of the movie. <br/><br/>There are seriously silly novice mistakes in the movie... one we call the 'floating chopsticks' where they mysteriously reappear in one scene, there's the 'claw caress' where someone's hand just disappears in another.. then towards the end, there's the ""Was that a Si Box?"" scene where this huge prop is given to someone- then flat out disappears... not to mention once Wolverine totally impales someone dramatically w/a close-up & seconds later one of the other cohorts just picks him up, like, ""shake it off buddy, I gotcha..."". Or how about- ""There's a ninja-like guy sitting on the roof 100 feet away & the place is guarded to the teeth w/armed samurai-like trained men & hundreds of people, and not one other than Wolverine notices?"" REALLY?! I have a pet peeve in quality movies: Do NOT do flashbacks of what we just saw 15 mins ago- it's a waste of production, time & money. It not only insults our intelligence, but, calls attention to poorly written dialogue and acting, if they can't convey the importance of the moment- this is a directors cop-out & trap. <br/><br/>Then there's the time warp, whereas this is supposed to occur after X3 (which they clearly demonstrate w/in 5 mins. of the film) and the original comic book Lady Deathstrike story is blown to bits. The original story took place when the X-Men were just beginning & Kitty Pryde had only just visited the team & hadn't joined. I would guess that the girl who plays ""Yukio"" is a nod to the Lady D (Yuriko) story but for the movie is merged into Mariko's (the love interest) character whereas her father is the Silver Samurai (Notice the similarities in the names?). Which if it followed the original writings, would make her Lady D. As a fanboy, that's where I was disappointed. <br/><br/>As a movie watcher- I would lump this movie into the same area where poorly screen-written James Bond flicks are stored in my grey mass. I say poorly written because this movie depends on the acting of one man, with boatloads of action to carry it. Not to mention the obvious distaste for the main character by some woman who is saved by him, who ends up sleeping with him. The plot hole in the movie that coincides with this is that there is no leading up to romance between said hero & damsel in distress. Another similarity is the campy villain: They created another character: Viper. I guess they couldn't afford the real Silver Samurai story. Inasmuch as I enjoy what they did w/this character as a villain- they just don't show her colors in the writing & story. She's just some self-serving denigrate mutant who they try to squeeze into the story. Lastly, as my friend likes to point out- these days studios like to give away best scenes in the trailers & sneaks- and the bullet train scene is one of those.<br/><br/>The supporting acting of Rila Fukushima added a lot to the movie- as she is boatloads of attitude, skills, action & style. She deserves a spin-off. The tribute to Stan Lee at the beginning of the movie was really cute. Guess they couldn't afford his standing cameo for all Marvel films... <br/><br/>-There is one classic Background Actor Lurker moment that was hilarious to me- he should be given an award- when Viper is meeting someone in one of the seedy parts of town- when they meet, there's this Extra who's making a face and looking all over ridiculously, way exaggerated. To me, that was classic & at the same time showed the novice production of this film.<br/><br/>DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS IN 3D AT ARCLIGHT THEATRES. THE GLASSES LOW QUALITY DIMINISH THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE FILM, plus- it just wasn't made to be a 3D cinematic experience.<br/><br/>There is so much more to be said, but, there's only so much room."

","I am certainly not an expert on X-Men and the Wolverine. I only wished I had read some reviews before I went to see this. I like Hugh Jackman, but the plot and the pace of this film were too boring. It starts out interesting enough but it is downhill from there. 75% of the film IMHO is violent. The fight scenes could have been shortened for at least 30 minutes. The film is 126 minutes long. I could have tolerated it better if it was 96 minutes long. I left it feeling I had wasted my time, and I would definitely not recommend it to my friends. I am not a fan of violence coupled with a non-engaging plot. I found myself wanting it to be over long before it was. The action scene fight on the Bullet train made me think of Skyfall the James Bond movie which had a train scene fight as well. That movie was so much better than this. The PG-13 rating should be more of an R because of so much violence and adult topics. It's best for the over 17 audience, not the early teens."

","The movie is a step backward from the 2009 Fox Movie X-men Origins Wolverine. With a weak story, poor adaptions of characters from the comic books and other flaws, this is a waste of 11 dollars. It paled in comparison to other summer blockbusters like Man of Steel. This Movie should have never been greenlit for production and was not worth it. The movie centers around Wolverines adventures in Japan and about a man who he saved from Nagasaki, I had no idea what was going on until a good 40 minutes into the lackluster film. Overall, with the poor cgi, special effects and lacking story, (story 4/10), this was not worth my time or my money and I advise you not to go see it.

"norrisj15","1","5","11","28 July 2013"," The Wolverine: The Trailer That Said it All
","http://filmthroughmyeyes.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>INTRO: <br/><br/>Another movie from the storied Marvel franchise staring their most iconic X-Men member James ""Logan"" Howlett a.k.a. Wolverine. This time around the directorship of the film was passed to James Mangold who was the director of one of my favorite movies 3:10 to Yuma. Hugh Jackman stars as Wolverine as usual. These three factors (Marvel's Wolverine, Hugh Jackman, and James Mangold) should constitute a fantastic movie. This particular film is an adaptation from the 1982 comic book series of the same name. The film originally began in 2009 with Darren Aronofsky (director of Black Swan and The Wrestler) as the director, but was delayed due to a variety of things including the earthquake and tsunamis in Japan. In 2011, James Mangold took over for Aronofsky.<br/><br/>PLOT: If you watched the trailer for this movie, you could have guessed the entirety of the plot. Nothing in this movie would have surprised you at all except for the mars themed room that Logan and Mariko rent at a sex hotel on their way to Nagasaki. The trailer showed wolverine meeting Yashida, not being able to heal as fast, fighting Viper, fighting a giant silver samurai, and talking with Yashida about removing Logan's immortality. That is the entirety of the movie. The fight scene on the train was even shown in the freaking trailer. <br/><br/>ACTING:<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is his typical Wolverine character. His muscles are big, his beard full, and his Australian accent nonexistent. He plays Wolverine well as he has in all of the X-Men movies, so I won't belabor any analysis of his performance.<br/><br/>The leading ladies of the film, Markio and Yukio, are played by actresses with very limited previous movie experience. Both of them deliver adequate performances and fill their characters well.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting was fine in the movie. Viper's actress Svetlana Khodchenkova (Russian much?) plays the over the top psychotic villain. Her character very much reminded me of Poison Ivy from the Batman world and the 1997 movie Batman & Robin which had one of the most star studded casts of any super hero movie.<br/><br/>TAKEAWAYS:<br/><br/>Save yourself two hours and watch the 2 minute trailer to understand the entirety of this movie. The character's actions have zero motivation behind them. How this movie moved through the script is beyond me. How hard can it possibly be to make a good Wolverine movie? His character is so solid. He has mental issues that as a director you could dive into and make Batman-like. There are also a lot of really cool villains in the X-Men universe to play opposite the Wolverine. Bottom line: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>RATING:<br/><br/>The film gets 0/5 Chuck Norris thumbs ups."

","I want to start off by saying that read my title and trust me look at origins as never having been made. The Wolverine is a Xmen movie i can feel good about again because quite frankly ever since X2 and ""maybe"" Last Stand (yes i like last stand) all xmen movies were very shall i say slow and boring. Origins was by far worse then First Class but First Class i still felt was rather slow paced and kinda bland acting for the most part. Now that we have Wolverine i feel like the films can get back on track with what made Xmen and X2 so much fun to begin with.<br/><br/>Of course there are some points in the movie i found somewhat ""cliche"" but still Wolverine is definitely Marvel's answer to the Dark Knight where its a movie about dark times and superb acting not just blowing stuff up.<br/><br/>So even if your not an Xmen fan you still should look at this movie as pure summer fun with a brain not dumb summer fun with bad acting and no plot"
"italo505","10","5","11","27 July 2013"," The Better Man of Steel
","When it comes to superhero movies we've had more than a decent share in recent years: Spider-Man, Iron Man, The Avengers, Thor (and the upcoming Thor 2), Dark Knight, Man of Steel, you name it, it's been done, sometimes overdone and overkill if you ask me. Still, no word about Wonder Woman... We've come to expect the greatest in CGI effects, settings and graphics, state of the art 3D effects that will make the audience come back for more. The one thing that I have gotten pretty tired of lately is such overload of special effects that almost takes over the story instead of enhancing it, leaving us without much substance and fulfillment. Such is the case with Man of Steel which I had expected it would bring something new to Superman that I hadn't seen before, a side of weakness and humanity that will make us relate to the hero everyone already knows and loves. And, although it brought us the familiar story of a boy sent to Earth after his home planet Krypton was destroyed and gave us great eye candy to look at with Henry Cavill as the Man of Steel, it lacked something, the side of Superman that we yearn to see: ourselves. In order for any superhero to grab the audience's attention is that it should be relatable and, quite frankly, I could not relate much with a man in tights with a giant S on his chest without having a strong actor and a great, smart script that will make me believe in him. Luckily, Superman is not the only man made of steel in theaters this year: Wolverine has come to the rescue. Once again, Hugh Jackman comes to reprise his role as Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine, for the eighth time (that's right, boys and girls, eight times!) and he is better than ever. This time is the story of just Logan, a man that has left the mutants league and is found living in the woods, away from civilization yet close enough to gather whatever he may need, like batteries for his FM radio. The image of his lost love Jean Grey (reprised by Famke Janssen) haunts him and tortures him to the point where there's not a day that goes by when he doesn't blame himself for her death. A struggle that makes Logan very vulnerable by the minute. Soon Logan is summoned by an old friend from Japan, a man he saved from the atomic blast of the bomb thrown to Hiroshima right after the Pearl Harbor attack. The man is an honorable and noble businessman who looks to live forever and proposes to turn Logan into a mortal, to end his curse that is to live forever. I am glad that The Wolverine doesn't tap much into the X-Men universe and we never get to see Logan step into his tight superhero suit, although the ladies (and some gentlemen, too) will be glad to know that Hugh Jackman shows his ripped body quite a bit throughout the movie, an intense workout routine and a diet that consisted of eating six whole chickens a day has really paid off for the 44 year old and even landed him in Fitness magazines everywhere. I never thought of Logan as a comic superhero here but a man cursed with steel claws, the ability to heal and his immortality. And there is a difference. Specially when his powers get taken away and all we have left is a man that hurts, bleeds, gets tired and is vulnerable like the rest of us. Someone we humans can relate to. I also enjoyed the Japanese settings, the hustle of Tokyo, the scene atop the bullet train that kept me at the edge of my seat, the cheap motel with different themes to choose from, the serene setting near Hiroshima, the Japanese costumes like the beautiful kimonos the heroine wears (Mariko played by Tao Okamoto), the samurais with their fight choreographies, the Japanese warrior and everything else that elevated The Wolverine into an unexpected and, why not, artistic side that I didn't expected to see in a movie inspired by a comic book. Expect to see even more Wolverine when X-Men: Days of Future Past comes to theaters in 2014. In the meantime, make sure not to miss The Wolverine, arguably the better Man of Steel we'll see this year. Sorry, Superman!"

"matthewstelly","8","2","3","13 December 2015"," Wolverine, Asian culture and race
","Like Superman, this is another comic book hero who is indestructible. The difference is that Wolverine is a mutant and has been operated on by some super scientists and has a body that is filled with a skeletal structure that is metal. He can spring giant claws from his fists and when injured, his wounds heal automatically. With that out of the way it should not surprise anyone that this movie is very political and, like Superman, very ethnocentric. In this case, we find Wolverine – who is, by the way immortal – is in an underground holding cell during what appears to be the American bombing of Nagasaki. This was the second time a nuclear bomb was dropped on Japan (the first one having been on Hiroshima). Wolverine saves the life of one of the Japanese officers and somehow this man bonds with Wolverine, although they have not seen each other for years. The movie is about genetics. The Japanese guard knows of Wolverine's power and knows that Wolverine doesn't want to be super any more, just wants to be a regular white boy. This is because he lost his long-time love Jean (in earlier episodes) who he had to kill because she had been turned evil by Magneto. At any rate he's a loner but this cute Asian chick is sent to fetch him so that the Japanese officer, who is dying but who is the head of a mega-sized research lab, can say his last good-byes to his ""friend."" The movie is also about culture. In one scene as Wolverine and the heiress sit down to eat, he has his chop sticks stuck into some meat, standing vertically as he opts to use a fork. She gently takes them and places them on the table, letting him know that chop sticks that are standing represent antagonism of some kind. Even after that the scene continues and then he does it again. And once again this proud woman gently takes the chop sticks and sets them down. We learn that when it comes to the proper use of a Japanese sword, you use two hands, not one. And we learn that the vaunted Ninjas are known, in the early days of their formation, as ""the black clan."" The Japanese has a simple plan: since he knows Wolverine doesn't like immorality or his super powers, he (the Japanese) has a way where Wolverine's powers can be transferred to HIM, therefore enabling Wolverine to become mortal, eventually fall in love and die of old age. But Wolverine knows that his powers are not always a blessing and tells the man, ""You don't want what I've got."" The plot thickens because, unbeknownst to us, the Japanese guy has willed all his finances and corporate power of Yashida Industries, to his grand daughter. The bad guys want her out of the picture and try to assassinate her. Aided by the cute Asian chick who flew him to Japan, Wolverine and the heir take off and try to hide. Along the way Wolverine's powers have been weakened because some blonde mutant female blew some kind of smoke into his lungs during a kiss. So the Japanese guy wants the white man's genetic code and his powers – he wants eternal life. The white man with the powers simply wants to get on with his life and get as much pussy as possible. Two of the most beautiful women I've seen, who just happen to be Asian, are slobbering all over this guy, one as a self-appointed ""body guard"" and the other who has slept with him, inherits an empire and begs him to stay (which, of course, in line with the ""lone wolf motif,"" he turns down). At no time does anyone mention the fact that America was behind the dropping of that bomb. Even when Wolverine and the heiress return to Nakasaki, he references the hole that he and her grandfather dived into to escape the explosion's radiation, but America is not indicted or held responsible a single time for making the racist decision to drop a bomb on a race of people who, to this day, feel the effects of those two bombs being dropped on their two major cities. So it's selective history wrapped around a racially (genetic) driven movie."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","2","3","27 July 2014"," Quite enjoyable, better than Origins
","The Wolverine is not as good as the first two X-Men films, which were very good and great respectively. But it does improve on Last Stand and Origins by quite a fair bit, neither are as bad as they're reputed to be but had a lot of glaring shortcomings. That is not to say that The Wolverine had no shortcomings either. There is some illogical scripting, the romance is a bit forced and the extended scenes that has it bogs the film down, the ending is a bit too rushed, some scenes dragged and were a touch repetitive and the Japanese characters were very under-written and not at all interesting. What The Wolverine does do that improves on Origins and Last Stand is that it isn't anywhere near as bad as trying to incorporate too many subplots and too many characters and then develop hardly any of them. The film looks great, the special effects improved over those from Origins, it's slickly edited, it's shot cohesively and it has a beautifully dark look that gives it both a grit and audaciousness. The music is suitably dynamic and while not completely action-enhancing it at least fits. The story is not perfect, but there was a dark intensity there, some unexpected twists and turns and I didn't have too much trouble following it, while the action is smartly handled especially the Throne of Blood-like ninja fight and the one on the superfast train. The funeral one was reasonably fun too but was over too quickly. James Mangold does valiantly and unlike Brett Ratner and Gavin Hood he is actually comfortable throughout instead of being good in one aspect(the action) and not in the other. The performances are fine, although Tao Okamoto's beauty is nowhere near enough to salvage her bland acting. Rila Yukushima's acrobatics dazzle and of the femme fatales Svetlana Khodchenkova is even better, slinky and formidable. But Hugh Jackman gives the best performance, a very powerful performance while being subdued, it was nice to see some depth to him this time when in Last Stand and Origins he was moody for the sake of it seemingly and not much else. The Japanese culture was very nicely done and gave the film some diversity. To conclude, a decent and quite enjoyable film that serves as a better but still not perfect origins story. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox"

","As long as I've known about the character, he's been Wolverine. So why is this movie called ""The Wolverine""? <br/><br/>Until the great final battle against the monster adamantium machine, I was enjoying the development of the story line dating back to the Japanese prison camp outside of Nagasaki. It sets up the action in the present day with the dying Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) summoning Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to his bedside for a final good-bye. Wolverine's struggle with his own immortality is fertile ground for a much more in depth study than what we get here; his decision is made too easy when he finds himself helpless without the extreme healing ability.<br/><br/>But I guess you can't have everything. I was never a Marvel comics fan per se, and only know the characters peripherally so I don't get as worked up as some reviewers on this board. Hugh Jackman is pretty cool as the title character and does a credible job. Fans of this stuff require their over the top action and this one provides it well enough.<br/><br/>The only thing is, as long as I've known about the character, he's been Wolverine. So why is this movie called ""The Wolverine""?"
"tedg","Null","2","3","27 March 2014"," Sniffing the Dog that Went Before
","There isn't much to say about the ordinary features of this. It is a Marvel production and that means the world is dull in all aspects. They seem incapable of leaving safe territory, so this is more or less Michael Bay in the nineties.<br/><br/>But there is something interesting going on. The way these films are put together, I believe, is as a set of manufactured stereotypes for the world market. You can't just target the US any more. <br/><br/>Of course you still have to have a baseline of American grit, with the structure of a Western. And you have to honk around with roles of women. Those are essential for this recipe. <br/><br/>What's interesting to me is the way the Japanese are handled. Japanese culture as filtered through film is a more powerful influence I think than even Europe minus Italians. Italian storytelling stands apart in film, and the influence is strong.<br/><br/>But not as strong as Ozu and Kurosawa. Heck, Japanese film makers even did French new wave better. So when a film wants to leave the underground of who invented what in the cinematic vocabulary and just shuffle stereotypes, but from the same world, it folds into something novel.<br/><br/>Our guy on the other side is a somewhat noble officer at a POW camp. Saved from The Bomb, he turns on his savior because he wants the technology in his soul. One of the world's richest technology companies was created by this guy, but instead of the American Tony Stark model, he can only implement ideas from others. The genius in the picture is a Western woman, incidentally evil in ordinary ways, who is hired by our Japanese mogul.<br/><br/>Part of the stereotyping is that nothing is settled on the western side. Our hero hates his life of constant pain and remorse. Our western evil woman knows she is absolutely evil. But shift to the corrupt Japanese politician, the organized crime hoards, the Japanese boss, the rejected boyfriend... All these live in a world in which their actions are proper."

The darker tone manages to make the story feel more important, you can feel the agony from Logan's character in this one. It's actually somewhat tough to endure with how much Logan is going through. His desire to live is completely overshadowed by the pain he is suffering from Jean Grey's death that took place in X-Men III. He no longer wants to fight, just to live like a hermit and get drunk. I thought it was a really good look at a drastic character change from Wolverine. On the other hand, the lack of humor really hinders the movie at times. It takes itself so seriously at times that it almost becomes draining, especially at over two hours long. It isn't as well-rounded as the original either, despite being a tad more emotional. I did love the storyline of Wolverine having his power taken away to essentially deal with immortality. It made for some great storytelling. I dug the setting in Japan for the most part. It delivers some fantastic action scenes. My favorite is the one on top of a train. That one was absolutely exhilarating. Hugh Jackman is fantastic as usual. He is at his most intense yet as Wolverine. As I explained at the start of my review, his character takes a drastic turn that is filled with despair and agony. He is an extremely flawed hero in this one, showing plenty of courage and intestinal fortitude. Aside from his performance in Prisoners, this may be the best he's ever been. Tao Okamoto is a bit cantankerous and ungrateful at the start, but she turns in a decent performance when all is said and done. My favorite female performer is Rila Fukushima. She had plenty of spunk and charisma. She was also rather bad ass and had terrific chemistry with Jackman. Svetlana Khodchenkova is engagingly menacing as Viper. She had the right facial expressions to creep anyone out and made a terrific enemy. Hal Yamanouchi and Ken Yamamura do great jobs as Older and young Yashida respectively. Famke Janssen's role is nothing more than a glorified cameo. She is still deceased and pops up here and there in dream sequences to give Logan moment's of truth. It served its purpose. There is a bit of a plot hole that puzzled me. Jean claims to be lonely where she is, yet Scott Summers dies in the beginning of X-Men III. You'd have thought she would have some company. I realize Jean loved both, but still. I don't know, maybe I missed something. It just struck me as a bit odd<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: This is a very good sequel in it's own right. It's dark, mean, and very enjoyable. You can't go wrong with Wolverine 1 or 2 in my opinion. If you want two hours or so of entertainment, check this one out. I hope Hugh Jackman decides to reprise his role as Logan in the third installment<br/><br/>7.6/10"

","Pity poor Logan, aka The Wolverine, that immortal lycanthropic mutant with retractable adamantine claws played by that Jack-of-all-trades entertainer Hugh Jackman. All Logan wants is to be left alone to live as a hermit, spending his boundless days working as a logger, brooding over his condition and occasionally talking to the dead wife he accidentally killed who shows up occasionally to convince him to do away with himself and join her on the other side (apparently, she doesn't quite get this whole ""immortality"" thing).<br/><br/>But like Michael Corleone in ""Godfather III,"" every time Logan thinks he's out, someone pulls him back in. In ""The Wolverine,"" that person is a sword-wielding Japanese seer (Rila Fukushima) who convinces Logan to travel to Japan to say goodbye to the aged and dying Japanese prison guard whose life Logan saved during the bombing of Nagasaki. But things are never quite as simple as they seem in the movies, and soon Logan finds himself involved with the Yakuza, ninja warriors, the man's beautiful young granddaughter (Tao Okamoto) and some pretty messy intra-family politics.<br/><br/>Though it features some impressive sword fighting and some cool mano-a-mano fisticuffs atop a Japanese bullet-train, ""The Wolverine"" ultimately feels empty and half-hearted, a soulless exercise done in by longwinded speechifying and mediocre plotting. Better luck next installment."

","Hugh Jackman and cast is great, and did a lot with what is truly an awful script and production.<br/><br/>The series of events is predictable. It's essentially the remake of many many movies before, with no originality whatsoever. <br/><br/>Then the production reminds of fx seen in the 1980's with people having fights on bridges periodically covered in steam/smoke and then the viper deciding to shed her skin. This would have been staple food of the sci fi of yester year, and the worst is that the make up etc is on equal par with movies of those days.<br/><br/>Rather rent a beta-max version of The Terminator.

"Gordon-11","Null","2","3","23 November 2013"," A bit disappointing
","This film tells the story of Wolverine combating bad guys who targets the family of the man whom he saved in Japan during the Second World War.<br/><br/>This is the second Wolverine spin off already in recent years, and hence this Wolverine has certain expectations to live up to. I find ""The Wolverine"" to be all talk and no action. There is so little action scene, and even the ending fight isn't that spectacular. Maybe Hollywood has spoilt viewers so much by the amazing visual effects, that ""The Wolverine"" looks rather underwhelming. The story is far too contrived too, especially the love story between Wolverine and Mariko. I find it very hard to believe that they would fall in love under the circumstances.<br/><br/>As a big budget blockbuster, I think ""The Wolverine"" leaves much to be desired."
"bob the moo","Null","2","3","23 November 2013"," Solidly enjoyable even if it is not as memorable as it should have been
","I'm not sure if this film counts as sequel or a reboot or what but it certainly feels like another run at making a Wolverine film rather than a sequel to the first attempt at it. From the very start the tone is noticeably darker which I guess is to try and placate fans who don't like the family friendly version of the character that was more or less served up before. Although this dark edge isn't really present in more than the mood, it is a more satisfying tone to the film and it engaged me more as a result. The second thing it did well was to set the vast majority of the film in Japan and to blend the reality of the country (tradition, bullet trains, pachinko arcades) with the version that will appeal to the target audience comic book fans (beautiful women, samurai, ninjas etc).<br/><br/>This setting gives the film an sense of cool that matches that of its central character and of course of its main star. This cool factor helps it a lot because the plotting is not particularly strong; good enough to frame the film but nothing special. Unfortunately the same can be said about the action. It is perfectly fine for what it is but in terms of action sequences there was only really one scene that I felt was pushing me and showed ambition and this was the action spreading out across Tokyo in the daytime. Outside of this there are some good martial arts scenes and then lots of CGI nonsense – all of which was fine but no more than this. I enjoyed the film but I never got away from the sense that this was a very careful film; the reaction to the previous had not been great and it felt like it was really making effort to not mess things up. This lack of real flair or risk taking was apparent and, while not enough to really hurt the film, certainly didn't see it excel.<br/><br/>The cast are as reliable as the film as a whole. Jackman is as good as Wolverine as he has ever been and he makes the most of his haunted and violent character; it really is a character that he was born to fit. Looking like she came right out of a graphic novel, Fukushima is a cool presence as ""bodyguard"" Yukio while Okamotois suitably fragile. Outside of this Will Yun Lee is cool in a rather obvious character but is underused. Khodchenkova does feel a little like someone who wouldn't have made the cut into the main X-Men movies and she didn't have the sexual presence that the film needed, even if she had the looks. The supporting cast of Japanese standard characters are fine and do what is asked of them.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is a solid, safe film which is enjoyable for what it does even if I would have liked more from it. It plays things safe for the most part, giving the viewer more or less what they expect but not pushing things beyond that. It'll do the job but it never has the style, flair, imagination or cruelty that I had hoped it would bring."

","After the lackluster feelings people had to ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" you'd think it wouldn't be tough to outdo it in being an entertaining effort. And this film does manage to do that, but not enough to be considered a great film experience.<br/><br/>Picking up where ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" left off, Wolverine is now living like a mountain man and battling his own guilt. But he is soon drawn into a web of conflict and honor in Japan, due to an old acquaintance, which has him facing not only his guilt and past, but his own sense of mortality.<br/><br/>Much of this story's main thrust and inspiration is taken from the early 80's mini-series by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. Director James Mangold does a decent enough job of implementing the facets of that story, while updating it for more modern sensibilities. He also does some wonderful work with some of the major action sequences, as well. But many of the performances just feel subdued, save for Jackman's as Wolverine. The emotional context of the scenes and motivations don't quite ring true. The love affair with Wolverine and Mariko (played by Tao Okamoto) Feels extremely rushed and forced. And the inclusion of Viper (played by Svetlana Khodchenkova) feels completely miscast and unnecessary. However, the last bit at the end during the credits, was a great bit of tease, which was a lot of fun and one of the best moments of the film.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman does his best to give you what you expect from the character he's spent over a decade bringing to life on the big screen. He perfectly provides you with a very realistic feeling for the inner turmoil within Wolverine's soul. But there are many lost opportunities to dig deeper into it, which are sidetracked for the action sequences and other characters machinations that aren't vital to the story and don't really advance the overall plot very much. There was so much more that could have been expanded upon with Wolverine and Mariko, if the time used on these superfluous character plots had not been in the way. Worst of all is that Yukio's character (played by Rila Fukushima) was totally wasted as little more than a plot exposition guru, there to fill in the blanks that the script and story didn't bear out as they should. Although, her battle in the medical lab with Shingen (played by Hiroyuki Sanada) was one of the better action scenes of the film, which I enjoyed very much.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, ""The Wolverine"" ends up as just a typical comic book movie. Not horrible, but not particularly great, either. I liked it, but then I'm also a big comic fan, too. As I said before, it is a better effort than the last Wolverine related film, but that falls under the heading of ""damning with faint praise."" Those who are fans of the character and his comic adventures will likely get some decent enjoyment from this, as will those looking for a semi-interesting action film. But those unfamiliar with the character and the comics this film uses for its basis, aren't likely to become new fans through this effort. Much like how comics are written today, if you haven't been a fan for a long time, there's going to be little done here to make you one now. This film feels much the same way!"

The mutants (Viper, actually a snake woman, here more of a Poison Ivy character) are not that present. The Japan setting never really shines. The film misses a lot of opportunities for great cinematography. There are little moment though! Hugh Jackman standing on top of a building while it's raining. Suddenly it feels like Blade Runner. That's cool but totally out of place here. Also the guest appearances by Famke Janssen as Jean Grey are stupid.

While in Japan, Wolverine encounters Viper woman (Svetlana Khodchenkova) his ""Kryptonite,"" and gets involved in a plot that gave me flashbacks to fine films like ""Toxic Avenger II"" and ""Nazis at the Center of the Earth.""<br/><br/>The plot had more complexity than what I expected or wanted to see. The action scenes were shot by shaking the camera at odd angles so we could feel the intensity. Instead I thought ""Why the low budget effect?""

The Japanese cast also does a great job, and not only that but the actress playing Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is breathtakingly beautiful in the film. <br/><br/>I like the fact that it is set in Japan which makes the look and the atmosphere of the film unique compared to most comic book flicks which usually take place in the U.S. (or Europe). Japan with its peculiar culture, traditions and architecture really feels like a whole different world, and the film conveys that very well.<br/><br/>The action sequences are nicely choreographed and shot, two of them (the amazing train fight scene and the funeral sequence) are especially entertaining. The characters are well fleshed out, the writing and the acting gives you the chance to care for them, and makes the emotional moments work. The Wolverine is really about the characters more than anything else.<br/><br/>It is true that the last act, with the two villains, almost feels like a different movie, the tone becomes inconsistent with the rest of the film.

Filming on the streets of Japan ""gorilla"" style, Mangold and Rmery give the fight scenes a frantic grit,as slick CGI is smoothly blended with criss-crossing gun battles and lively Kung-Fu. Clawing away at the Japanese underworld, Mangold paints the burning red comic book panels with fresh watercolour blues and neon yellows making Logan's bloody claw attacks pop.<br/><br/>Inspired by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's ""Ronin"" run of Logan comics,the screenplay by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank (with uncredited Christopher McQuarrie) wonderfully slice wandering anthology elements for a lean samurai tale that goes into what makes superhero Logan a tormented loner. Whilst ending with the traditional ""big boss"" comic-book final battle,the writers do take a different path to the fight with a corporate Thriller focus,which thrillingly unleashes Wolverine into the Yakuza underworld and Ichirō's complicated family life. Working with Mangold for the second of three times, Hugh Jackman gives an excellent performance as Wolverine,who is given a gravitas of a lone warrior by Jackman,which burns as the claws of the Wolverine appear."

","The Wolverine is directed well and so was it well written and the action sequences well choreographed but its not without its flaws though. As mentioned above The Wolverine still has the debris it's carried on from X-Men The Last Stand and I wasn't pleased with it. Wolverine has flashbacks of his lost love? Seriously? Isn't it time his healing factor took care of that already? I mean its the god-damn Wolvie we're talking about here. Jean Grey's flashbacks (more like boring nightmares and more than once) kept crawling into the plot disrupting the pace and I just didn't like it. Of course Wolverine is tormented from what he'd done in the past but that doesn't mean, we the audience need to be tormented from start to end. The Japan setting was a bit distracting as well and maybe thats a personal thing. I am not a big fan of Martial arts movies and there was an excess of martial arts settings and jargon here in the movie though it all did look good. Props were fantastic and the action sequences thick, especially the Bullet Train sequence is something to gape at.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman effortlessly steps into his Wolverine shoes for the 6th time and having worked with Mangold in Kate & Leopold did wonders for The Wolverine. This is the Logan we've all praised and been used to and Hugh easily slides into the role and storyline straight from X-Men The Last Stand albeit forgetting X-Men Origins Wolverine. But then again playing Wolverine would have become second instinct for Hugh by now. Supporting cast couldn't be praised for the same, most of them being just bait for the plot. Especially Wolverine love interest in the movies, I felt they had absolutely no chemistry. Rila Fukushima did an absolutely splendid job playing Yukio. I had huge expectations for Svetlana Khodchenkova who played the only other mutant in the movie, Viper but she just served for some eyecandy and wasn't even fleshed up to be a proper antagonist."

What works here is its examination of Wolverine's healing power and its position of either being a benefit or a curse. Wolverine is sheltered in the Yukon forest where he is haunted by nightmares. We learn that he was a POW in a Japanese war camp where he ends up saving the life of a Japanese soldier when an atomic bomb is dropped. He is eventually contacted by a female red headed Japanese fighter who claims that the soldier he saved is dying of cancer and seeks an audience with him. Reluctantly Wolverine joins her to a flight to Japan. Apparently he desires to arrange to have the power transferred to his body. Wolverine declines the offer and the following day he dies. At the funeral the deceased's daughter is abducted and a lot of Samurai fighting rains in. This is all fun until a third act where lame plot twists occur that nearly subdues the film. Directed by James Mangold who made Walk the Line and Cop Land. Hugh Jackman is in fine form as Wolverine who lives with this condition and retractable knuckle blades. Rila Fukushima steals scenes as the red headed Samurai. Other characters are about as interesting as cooking oil but Tao Okamoto as the soldier's daughter is never believable particularly in an attempted romance with Wolverine. Brian Tee plays a groom to be that is not to be by third act finish. On par with X-Men Origins: Wolverine where special effects heal shoddy writing. Score: 7 / 10"

So there was some really interesting, gripping scenes like when the bomb drops and the men commit suicide, but the whole Jean Grey thing was just stupid, some of the action was hard to keep up with and made my eyes go funny, there was some humour, like the bit when he said: go **** yourself pretty boy, but some of the dialogue was a bit corny and had no meaning, so the film could have easily been cut down a bit, (so god knows how long the extended cut is) the train fight was just a bit silly, they keep jumping over the metal things, then to to fight in combat with each other then all of a sudden there's another metal thing. Also the ninja fight near the end felt a bit short and they could've extended it a bit, they probably did in the extended cut) also when the ninjas invade, it was so stupid that they didn't see them.

","I enjoyed all the X-Men movies, and of course one of the best characters was Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman. <br/><br/>In this movie, ""The Wolverine"", set some time after the X-Men movies, Logan (the Wolverine) has dropped out of sight, he has a full beard, he is intent on avoiding conflict. Until, in Japan, he is forced to get involved again.<br/><br/>Some of the story is told in flashback, including a scene in Nagasaki years earlier where Logan saves the life of a Japanese man by pushing him into a deep well as protection from a nuclear blast. Now in present times, when Logan still looks the same age but the Japanese man is very old, and about to die, the man's granddaughter becomes the focus.<br/><br/>The granddaughter is Tao Okamoto as Mariko, who we find has been designated to inherit the industrial empire, but the old man is not ready to give up yet. He is looking for immortality and Logan becomes his target.<br/><br/>It is all Sci-Fi and fantasy but done very well. We enjoyed it and still are amazed that this talented song-and-dance man, Jackman, can play such an authentic Wolverine."
"Anurag-Shetty","8","6","15","26 July 2013"," Better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine but, still not brilliant enough.
","The Wolverine continues with the adventures of the most bad-ass X-Men of them all, Logan/Wolverine(Hugh Jackman). The film takes place several years after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand. Logan is still having nightmares about Jean Grey(Famke Janssen). Soon however, Yukio(Rila Fukushima) tells him that her employer, Yashida(Hal Yamanouchi) is dying & wants to offer Logan a reward for saving him from the Nagasaki nuclear bomb explosion. Yashida tells Wolverine that he can end his immortality so that, he can live a normal life & die an old man. Yashida also tells Logan that he can transfer Logan's healing powers to himself so that he can be healthy again. However, Logan refuses. A deadly new enemy called, Viper(Svetlana Khodchenkova) sucks out Wolverine's healing powers, making him vulnerable when he's fighting. In his will, Yashida leaves his granddaughter, Mariko(Tao Okamoto) in charge of his company which upsets her father, Harada(Will Yun Lee). Now, many deadly ninjas are after Mariko & her life is in danger. Now, it is up to Wolverine to protect Mariko at all costs, even if it costs him his life. <br/><br/>This film was superb. The action sequences were wonderfully executed. The 3D was spectacular, especially in the train fight sequence & the climax. But, the thing about this film that really bothered me was that, there were hardly any mutants except Wolverine & Viper. Though it's much better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, you miss mutants like Sabretooth, Deadpool, Gambit etc. This is definitely not the best X-Men film but, it's an extremely entertaining & jolly good way to spend your time. The performances was one of the highlights of the film. Hugh Jackman gives us his best portrayal of Logan/Wolverine yet! With no other mutants in the picture, this movie really showcased Jackman's acting abilities. Jackman brings to life a very vulnerable Logan, this time around. With his immortality stripped from him, Logan soon realizes that he cannot take any enemy lightly and he should either fight till he succeeds or die trying. The climactic battle between Wolverine & The Silver Samurai is another highlight of the film. Tao Okamoto is impressive as Mariko. Will Yun Lee is brilliant as Harada. Rila Fukushima is great as Yukio. Svetlana Khodchenkova is menacing as Viper. Hal Yamanouchi is outstanding as Yashida. Hiroyuki Sanada is effective as Shingen. Brian Tee is adequate as Noburo. Famke Janssen is spectacular as Jean Grey. The Wolverine is worth a watch for action movie buffs & Wolverine fans."

","Do you like the X-Men story from the movies? Are you hyped for the upcoming and long awaited X4? if the answer is yes to either then you have to go watch it. I think that too many people went into this film looking for a blood bath instead of looking for a movie that dealt with how Logan deals with Jean's death and how he picks himself up again and once again decides to go on. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie and I am an X-Men comic guy the company I went with also found it very enjoyable. The movie has some really good humour. Watch the usual extra scene at the end because it was EPIC!!! one of the guy who went with me said that scene alone was worth the 3D ticket price and he thought the movie was OK(he wanted more ragemode lol).<br/><br/>Overall the best movie out there right now, I'm assuming that you have watched all the summer blockbusters to date."

","I really wasn't excited for this. I thought it would be another action film with the same scenes and the same villain. I was right. The Wolverine adds nothing to the X Men movies as this spin off sequel misfires as another disappointment for movie. Two disappointments in the same year. The film starts out with a cool little scene of Logan in a village hiding from a atomic bomb as he saves a person. Then it goes to him going to Japan with a later called ""Bodyguard"" as his powers are taken away by The Viper. He also must protect a women who is being forced into her farther's business.<br/><br/>The movie has the most generic story and action scenes that you will ever see this year. It has no surprises or twists. Well, there are some twists but you can see them coming from around the corner because it is told by the main characters. The direction is lazy as Mangold does nothing to make this film any better. If we had flare to it, it would make this movie better. You got your actors trying to do the best they can with the mediocre script. You got the action scenes. Undemanding film goers will sure like this film. But It isn't something I would watch again.

"jdesando","Null","5","12","28 July 2013"," One of the best this summer
","""Eternity can be a curse . . . a man can run out of things to live for."" Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) <br/><br/>Mythology and poetry are rife with stories about gods who envy men, their emotions and even their deaths. The Wolverine admirably mixes this motif with some very fancy camera and foot work in one of the best sci-fi hero films of the summer.<br/><br/>Points should be given to director James Mangold and his writers for relocating the long-nailed hero, Logan (Hugh Jackman), to Japan, where samurai stories glorify lonely heroes with super battle powers. The contrast between his states-side forest home, where he strolls alongside a big bear that pees at will, and the glittering Tokyo with its perfectly appointed, exotic interiors, stresses the ambivalent world of a hero who wants to retire but is drawn back into civilization by his mission to be a soldier seeking justice.<br/><br/>Because it's an action film, The Wolverine is practically required by law to have memorable set pieces, Mangold doesn't disappoint. The mano a mano fight atop a 200 MPH bullet train is as good as any Bond battle. While the struggle with a giant Iron-Man/Transformers type mechanical enemy (why don't they see how awkward these metal monsters are?) is also a traditional contemporary sci-fi trope, Logan has drawn us so much into this sympathy that there's an extra anxiety in the suspense.<br/><br/>Unusual for a summer super hero film, Logan is surrounded by strong, intelligent women such as his tough ""body guard,"" Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who has a wildly scarlet wig; and femme fatale Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova and an appropriate stand-in for Uma Thurman), whose serpentine tongue should make most sane men slither away. Come to think of it, she does characterize herself rather humorously: ""A chemist, a nihilist, a capitalist . . . a viper."" <br/><br/>Actually I miss the constant joking of a Bond film—there just isn't enough wisecracking as when Logan fights Viper and says, ""I can do this all day, you twisted mutant bitch!"" As effective as these mutants are, when Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen arrive on the scene, I am exultant. Nothing like seasoned actors exuding wisdom to make a critic cry in happiness. <br/><br/>I'm satisfied to have a thoughtful and fun actioner toward the end of summer while feeling comfortable that Logan will return: ""A lot of people have tried to kill me... and I'm still here."""
"samuel-faciane","5","5","12","27 July 2013"," No Bueno
","The visuals were good. I saw this in 3D. I read the comics but the main problem of this movie was the was the characters just flipped flopped back and forth from good to bad. The story was not well thought out and there were slow parts in the movie that let you think about the problems of the story. Wolverine is suppose to be a bad ass but for what ever reason he keeps getting his butt kicked all the way through. I recommend you wait until it comes out on TV. This looks like another attempt by Marvel to do a half fast job with story telling. One last thing they keep putting in Jean Grey to talk to Logan. I know Logan has been through a lot but when you start having conversations with dead people you may need to check yourself into a psych ward."
"baqken","6","5","12","26 July 2013"," Rent it
","I saw this on a whim and wasn't really looking forward to it, if anything I thought it be terrible, that being said thought it was much better than the Origins movie that came out a while back. The opening doesn't even feel like a big budget blockbuster flick, it's slow paced, well shot; it's a very different feel from the usual approach with these movies.<br/><br/>Now I don't mean to say that it's a boring, drawn out, art house flick, but there is a level of care put to detail in this movie that goes over looked in most superhero summer movies at the expense of fast paced action and high stakes.<br/><br/>Then right around the last act of the movie it takes a sharp left turn to the outlandlishly absurd. It really feels like two different movies, and I might even entertain the idea that the studio execs were responsible for that, seems like they got their dirty hands on it from that point on. The Silver Samurai scene is every bit as ridiculous as you'd expect it be, and the finale is totally anticlimactic. <br/><br/>I wouldn't pay top dollar for it but I'd definitely watch it on a slow evening when the only thing on TV is a Lifetime movie. I wonder what Darren Aronofsky would've done with it had he not left it to work on Noah."

","Wow!! Love to see Hugh Jackman back in action and this time the much anticipated movie The Wolverine. For all the X-Men series this film stands out on top both in action and screenplay throughout.<br/><br/>Looking at The Wolverine's cast it was none other than The Wolverine/Logan stands atop. Man he is definitely ""The Man of Steel"" and most ferocious in all the action sequences the best one would expect the X-Men star.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman did acted this film with most courage whether the love part or battling the past agony or even the fight scenes. He definitely lived up to his reputation as The Wolverine super star.<br/><br/>****Spoilers of the film**** <br/><br/>However, after seeing the movie today, I didn't like the way the action in this film was pictured at the very end. It lacks innovative and new action sequences which spoils what most of the Wolverine fans would have expected. Also the movie was a bit slow at several places but it was overcome by the beautiful pacing of the story afterwards.<br/><br/>***Review*** <br/><br/>Overall a good and must watch action movie of the season. I would rate this a 8 out of 10 mainly for The Wolverine (Logan/Hugh Jackman)."
"patricklynch37","9","4","9","13 November 2013"," Enjoyable and Entertaining
","I really did enjoy this movie. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman wasn't the first choice to play Wolverine back in 2000's blockbuster X-men, but boy does he deliver. The movie is purely based on Wolverines journey with non of the other X- men involved. Is this Good or Bad? in my personal opinion Good. Its nice to see Wolverine doing a solo act, but that being said it can be perceived as a bit slow at times for those who haven't read the comics. They main villain in The Wolverine is Viper ( Svetlana Khodchenkova ) and like Hugh she wasn't the first choice either. The role was originally offered to Jessica Biel. That being said though she to delivers a really good performance and manages to maintain an excellent American accent and at times impossible to tell she's Russian. Though being said earlier that there are some slow moments for non-comic book readers the climax at the end really make up for it. Your heart will race as you fear for the characters and the shock surprise will leave people breathless. But by far the best thing about the movie is the mid-credit scene at the end. This scene leads on to 2014's X-men Days of Future Past with Hugh Jackman returning. All in all i really enjoyed watching this movie and would defiantly see it again."
"richcarter1962","4","4","9","12 November 2013"," Shameless Attempt to Leverage 1 more Movie with X-Men
","I checked the box that says this review might contain spoilers, really if you don't know what's going to happen 20 minutes into the movie then your just not paying attention, in your defense, it is pretty hard to focus your attention on this movie. Let's get the one bright spot out of way, Hugh Jackman gives another solid performance as Wolverine, outside of that this movie is BAD, the writing was horrible, the plot was horrible, there were a couple of new special effects. I couldn't decide in the last 20 minutes of the movie if they were ripping off Iron Man or Cletus the NFL robot you see every Sunday.<br/><br/>Honestly I wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this movie, it is easily the worst of all the spinoffs of the X-Men, and that's saying something because the Last Stand pretty much stunk it up as well."
"Jerghal","7","4","9","10 November 2013"," A Worthy X-Men film
","The previous film 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' left everyone very disappointed (including me) and almost ruined the franchise so they had to make an effort with this one to get the fans back on-board. 'The Wolverine' is certainly a much better film where they put the story more than the action and VFX in front. It's a sequel to X3 (where the X-Men disbanded) in which Logan struggles with is immortality and ends up getting involved with a Japanse company promising him to relieve him of this burden. The story and character centric approach does mean that the pace is much slower and sometimes they spend just too much time on the characters without really adding much depth. Cutting 15 to 20 mins out of this 138 min movie would certainly have helped. The action sequences we do get are well done with excellent VFX and they do try to be inventive and show some stuff we haven't seen before. Altogether a worthy X-Men film but not the best in series. BTW at the end of the film there is a short scene with Xavier and Magneto which sets us up for 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', a film of which expect allot more and which hopefully will be the best in the series, the trailers look interesting to say the least :)"

","It was one of the best movies I've seen this year. It wasn't a really complex movie or a deep movie but just a cool fight film. I loved the final scene we're the wolverine fight against the old man who tried to cut off his claws (it wasn't a really nice shot). That moment in the bunker where wolverine defended the Vietnamese was really awesome and heartbreaking. But sometimes it was the same over and over again but because of the fight scenes I forgive it;). The shot where the wolverine gets tens of arrows in his back was also not a nice shot and sad but it displayed the movie good. He got shot over and over again but stood up and survived."

","I went souley because I'm a huge Hugh Jackman fan. But the movie I thought wasn't bad. I love Hugh of course and thought that he put his all into it, but I also think that all the other actors did too. I could have done without the bear scene. I'm not really sure I understand the point in that was, but oh well. I enjoyed the action and humor in it, and thought it was a well put together film. But of course my favorite part was Hugh. It's a movie that my little brother who doesn't like the X-Men movies loved this one. It's definitely a movie I would recommend to anyone wither or not you've seen the other X-Men movies or wither or not you are a fan of the other movies or not."
"Tehmeh","7","4","9","12 August 2013"," The better Wolverine adventure
","I liked this, a lot. After the letdown of X3 and Origins movies, this was called for. I wanted this. It's not everything it could have been, but I'll take it gladly. I saw in the theatre, and now I saw the extended cut on blu-ray.<br/><br/>This movie tries to examine Logan's soul and basically his reasons to live. Why would he want to live (almost) forever? He's basically a drifter now, without purpose. Who/what is he and what does it take to find himself? Sadly, it's not as deep as I'm making it seem, but the core of the idea is put out there and also handled in a satisfactory manner. He lost his love (Famke Janssen's Jean Grey) in X3, and it haunts him. He has constant nightmares. At this point, many readers will get cautious. Don't worry, it's nothing cheesy as in X3 or Origins. The dreams deepen the story and Logan's motivations while fitting perfectly into the narrative. <br/><br/>Oh yes, the narrative. I like it. It's always present, be it a dream sequence, an action scene, a conversation scene or just plain exposition in various methods, it always furthers the story and most of the time (excluding the last act) it feels like a ""real movie"" instead of ""just"" a comic book movie. At times, s*** hits the fan and action starts, then it cools down again and lets us breathe, but it never feels rushed or prolonged. Everything in the pacing just seems to fit. I would also like to compliment the score, I even got a certain melody playing in my head after seeing the movie. Marco Beltrami, well done.<br/><br/>The action. Sometimes, there was a little too much shaky cam. Otherwise, love it. For a PG-13 film, there's a lovely amount of blood and that certain nasty grit (extended, unrated version has more blood and longer battles). Wolverine gets hurt a lot, and he hurts others a lot. There's one train scene that is impressive and memorable, but I liked the plain good old man-to-man fights the best.<br/><br/>The setting is different, and it's beautiful. Japan. You get some nice scenery, along with some old- and newschool Japanese architecture. Yes, you get samurai/ninja fights (one of them is clearly cut short, but included in the unrated cut). Not only just scenery and fights, but characters too. What I like about this movie is that it takes not only Logan, but the closest characters to him seriously. Yukio and Mariko (Rila Fukushima and Tao Okamoto, both starring in their first feature film) were two characters I really liked, and both are handled well, not just as props in a Wolverine movie. I became fond of them, especially Yukio who gets to have some nice action too. I would've liked Mariko to be more memorable, but at least she feels like a real person. The whole Japanese cast is good. Well done, thumbs up.<br/><br/>This movie is not perfect though, although I absolutely feel the need to see it again. Even though this is not a X-men movie but a Wolverine movie, he won't be the only mutant. One especially just...feels like doesn't fit in well, and most people who have seen the movie know who I'm talking about. I'm not sure if it's the character itself or the actor, but I didn't care much for it. Don't worry though, it doesn't ruin the movie and this isn't a mutant fest, this is Wolverine's movie. <br/><br/>Also, at the end things go a little crazy. Certainly nothing compared to what can happen in movies of this genre, but doesn't fit in well with the more realistic, more mature nature of the first 3/4 of this movie. Some may like it though, and even I can't say that I hate the final act, it just felt like a little stretch concerning the tone shift.<br/><br/>Another thing that can be a problem for some: It's not a mind-bending spectacle and certainly nothing of grand epic proportions happens (except for the very nice opening scene). In a way it's smallish in scale and just does what it sets out to do: gives us a pretty good Wolverine movie. It doesn't try to impress you that much, which can be good or bad, depending on what you're looking for. <br/><br/>Anyway, I came out of the theater a little underwhelmed, but still very satisfied. Wolverine's character was handled well. The story took its time and was paced nicely, cinematography was good, most characters were treated with respect, action was thrilling at times. In addition to that, the Jean Grey - love interest (which I wasn't a big fan of in the first place) gets finally wrapped up in a satisfying manner and perhaps I can now watch the dreaded X3 again without so many grievances.<br/><br/>I'll be honest: I'd probably give this a 6, if I could be neutral enough. If you take Wolverine out of the movie and replace him with John Doe, It would only be decent, even though it has the ""real movie"" feel to it. However, I'm just glad I got to see a Wolverine movie I can honestly like and respect - thus the rating of 8. The overall quality is certainly there. James Mangold is a good director, he knows how to construct a story and put it on the screen. This is the work of a good filmmaker.<br/><br/>The extended cut is worth it, though it doesn't improve the movie in itself but adds some nice touches here and there.<br/><br/>Reminder: don't miss the mid-credits scene at the end. Days of Future Past is around the corner."

Hugh Jackman has never been better in this role! Jackman is Wolverine. Even in the slow parts of the film, Jackman reals you back into it.

","I enjoyed this film, but then I enjoyed X-Men Origins: Wolverine as well. Though for different reasons obviously. That one was fun and I enjoyed seeing the different mutants they incorporated into the story, but at the end of the day it was a bit cheesy. This one is of a more serious tone, but this one seems more like a gateway film that was made to lead up to the super big X-men film coming out in 2014. Basically, putting the films on their course as it reestablishes the films are indeed all tied together with the exception of the origins one. So the first three films then First Class are connected. Though I do feel this film was made in part to set up next year's film, the darker tone and the setting made it a good film to me and better than Wolverine's last solo outing.<br/><br/>The story has Logan still struggling with the fact he ended Jean Grey's life in The Last Stand. He is living an isolated existence in the wilderness of Canada; however, a young girl named Yukio finds him and asks that he comes to Japan as the person she works for is dying and one of his wishes is to see the man that rescued him during World War II. Logan reluctantly agrees and soon learns that the man did not wish to merely say his goodbyes to Logan, but to offer Logan the chance to live a normal life then die as he wants Logan's mutant ability to heal for himself. Well Logan refuses, but there are more things going on as the old man's granddaughter is targeted by the Japanese mafia, a strange mutant named Viper seems to have her own agenda and Logan's healing abilities disappear. Logan must protect the granddaughter and learn to once again become The Wolverine in order to survive the many perils that await him.<br/><br/>The film is rated PG-13, but it probably only needs a couple of more things added to be an R. I find it strange that The Conjuring did get an R, but was not have as bad as this film as far as violence and language. The film has good action as I enjoy watching Hugh Jackman portray Wolverine; however, the story at times gets a bit to convoluted as this person is really working for that person or this man is the one that is trying to kill the other person. Thankfully, though the story is passable enough to lead to some great shots and scenes. The Silver Samurai was pretty cool at the end and also make sure to wait for an nice ending scene after a few of the credits pass. This scene does so much more than the one seen at the end of Iron Man 3 as it actually establishes something.<br/><br/>So I enjoyed Wolverine's second solo outing, though at some point I wish they would spend a bit more time with some of the other X-Men (granted, they did that a bit with First Class). I enjoyed the setting of this one more as I enjoyed the overall feel of this film to Origins. I also liked that this film establishes that The Last Stand happened and this was not yet another quick reboot. I am very much looking forward to the next X-Men film, but it was nice to see everybody's favorite mutant slash and stab his way back into theaters."
"suneet_walia","6","4","9","3 August 2013"," Too long, unexciting.
","Several people criticized the last Wolverine movie as simplistic and shallow. We were made to believe that the latest movie would strike the right balance between depth and adrenaline. Guess what, it has managed neither. In India there is a saying- ""Dhobi ka kutta na ghar ka na ghat ka"". It basically signifies that sorry state that results when you try to be two things at once and end up being neither. An identity confusion ensues. The moment this movie ended, the above saying just popped into my mind. There's a new wave sweeping in Hollywood. A fad has developed to try and make superheroes more 'real' with shades of grey. Christopher Nolan epitomizes this, rather successfully, with his Batman series. His Batman movies are dark, have depth, keep you thinking and have top notch action. Not that Batman series of movies has no flaws, it's just that he's somehow managed to strike a balance. Several other superhero movies- our latest Wolverine movie- for example, seem like pitiable caricatures, misdirected endeavors. The balance between psychological depth and adrenaline has been mismanaged. The depth seems contrived, and action- unconvincing and unexciting."
"phd_travel","8","4","9","2 August 2013"," A huge improvement
","This is much better than the 2009 ""X Men Origins"". It has an onward momentum, involving characters and an exotic story set in Japan with a bit of WWII. Wolverine protects a Japanese friend's daughter.<br/><br/>Liked the seaside setting in Nagasaki and the Tokyo villa. The mostly Asian cast is good from Korean American Will Yun Lee to the two different but attractive Japanese actresses: the lovely model like Tao Okamoto as Mariko and Rila Fukushima as a feisty sidekick. Hiroyuki Sanada from Revenge plays Marikos evil father.<br/><br/>The action sequences aren't tedious. Liked the bullet train scene. The various martial arts sword fighting and arrow sequences are clearly done. If there had been any more fights it would have been repetitive. Only the last part was a bit too overblown. Unfortunately the Famke Jansen flashbacks are a bit annoying - she is getting a bit old for the flashbacks. Didn't really need to have the Japanese girl and gaijin hookup.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman still is fine in his tough role despite the passage of time and puts a lot of effort and intensity into it.<br/><br/>Overall if you are thinking of giving this one a miss it would be a mistake.

The film follows as a direct continuation of the third film of the Trilogy X-Men 3 The Last Stand, the course of the film it is possible to note how Logan is upset because of what happened to Jean Grey, at various times he has dreams about her and this serves as a settling into the fabric to form a unique personality of the character. Soon the beginning of the film is very exciting, however in the course of the movie experience becomes different, Wolverine loses his healing factor and leaves the film tiring for an extended period and really gives up sleep, it's boring. In the final moments of the film, the experience improves again as the film becomes exciting. During the film is shown a considerable amount and characters each with their personalities, the action is also very good both the Primary and Secondary Characters, Mariko (Tao Okamoto) has a key role in the plot, but on occasion lose direction and is all unbalanced, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) Encorporou the character very well. The fight scenes though few are excellent, nothing too much blood and be headings as many would like to see, but are exciting. there is a good amount of times that portrays the Japanese culture during the entire movie dialogs with locals are entirely in Japanese which demonstrates a tone of originality. the soundtrack is OK, we have some very exciting music, and special effects also OK, we also villains like the Viper and the Silver Samurai, both are compelling. And by the end, be sitting in the chair until the end because we have a post credits scene, it is Incredible! one of the most exciting scenes ever made into a movie, which is directly linked to the next movie Mutants: X-Men Days of Future Past. In order Wolverine: Immortal is a good movie despite some flaws in the film as the wearing parts and even the very fabric of the plot and the film does not fail to be good, and no doubt is a film that represents the character pretty well. although not what many would like to see, the film has its qualities."
"oana_cerbanescu","3","4","9","31 July 2013"," Huge disappointment
","Yes, the movie has a few action scenes that will keep you in front of the screen until the end and if you like this kind of cheesy cinematography, there is some loving and some inner fighting and the protagonist goes through a series of initiatic changes, BUT as a X-men fan I have many many problems with the movie:<br/><br/>-First of all and the most important: If I can remember correctly, Wolverine has been chosen for the adamantium insertion process BECAUSE of his regenerative powers. He was the only one who could survive the whole process, so stealing the adamantium inside him does not mean stealing his mutant regeneration powers. The entire movie is based on a nonsense. Grandpa Yashida shouldn't have regenerated in the final robot scene and he definitely shouldn't have got any younger.<br/><br/>-Considering point 1 and the fact that adamantium was artificially inserted into Wolverines body, How could he regenerate it after it was ( most of it or all) extracted from his body?<br/><br/>-What's up with the Viper chick? That character is just wrong! What exactly is her power? What's with the skin shedding?<br/><br/>-The first scene with the dream inside a dream idea is a horrible cliché<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think this was the worst X-men movie. All the nonsense and illogical ideas made me wanna punch myself in the face."
"rcolgan","8","4","9","31 July 2013"," Some of Logan's scars never heal...
","The X-men franchise is back on top form as we finally get the film that we wanted X-Men Origins: Wolverine to be. Whilst Origins stood as a film that repressed key characters like Wolverine and Deadpool (he's called the merc with a mouth for a reason) The Wolverine takes us to the animal, scarred and adamantium core of an amazing character, taking him to new levels unseen on screen before. <br/><br/>This success is in great part due to Jackman's incredible return to the role as he once again brings his A game to make the comic book character come to life on screen. Within it, Jackman brings just the right level emotion to the character with the events of Last Stand still haunting him and unable to live life the way he once did. The films plot allows great range to Wolverine as we get to see him both at his weakest, being inches from death and at his strongest where he holds back the least. <br/><br/>While elements of the screenplay does have it's downfalls such as lack of character depth for the leading villains, this is more than made up for through the sheer depth finally given to Wolverine to allow for a more detailed version of the character than seen before. Also part of me would have liked to see more mutants within the plot with only around 4- 5 mutants appearing on screen. But after Origins that may not necessarily be a bad thing... <br/><br/>Another great part of the film is we once again see James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma, Walk the Line) take the directing wheel, which he does terrifically not holding back from the source material and showing Logan as the powerful beast that he can be through terrific fight scenes such as a funeral fight and a train scene. He demonstrates how he doesn't hold back after opening first scene where we witness Nagasaki and the sheer destruction of an atomic bomb showing to us the audience the films realistic tone and that they'll have a blast of a time! (Sorry, couldn't resist the pun.)<br/><br/>This is definitely a different film from all other films in the X-men franchise, taking a darker turn to allow a better reflection to better display Wolverine. But despite differences, it serves as a strong addition to the franchise and despite some differences remains loyal to the original The Wolverine comics. Thus this is a must see for any Wolverine fans as it makes the best adaption of the character seen yet. But if you need any other I'll simply say after credits sequence, STAY FOR IT."
"chrisd333","2","4","9","30 July 2013"," Sorry but ... terrible
","Al in all i thought this was very poor quality. <br/><br/>The acting all round was pretty bad (I like Hugo but he has made much better performances). The characters seemed ridiculous too, with the robotic samurai, Mrs I dress up all in green, don't ever say much and bring nothing to the film, the ninjas too (I study and practice Ninjutsu, and these guys did not operate at all the way the did in Medieval Japan), and that Japanese actress with her ""Logan"" exclamation at the end of the film while he is being attacked....haven't seen anything so cheesy in a long time!<br/><br/>Overall this film was BORING and UNVENTFUL for me, and I don't recommend it to anyone, apart real Wolverine fans who like the story. Film-lovers - don't go there!<br/><br/>I don't actually know the entire history/story behind Wolverine's character, but if the producers accurately followed it, then thumbs up, but why make it such a cheesy and poor act?"
"DrAwesomeness","6","4","9","30 July 2013"," Not as good as hoped I'm afraid - spoilers galore ahead.
","High expectations after reading some of the reviews, made this movie rather disappointing. And a bit dull. In every scene with Hishida (I am not even sure of the name, and I just saw the movie) he looked so plastic and CGI that it was very distracting) And don't even get me started on the strange ending with the robot suit fight. There was a few cool scenes though. The heart one was good and I really liked the red headed side-kick. And the best was the throw-back to the bone-claws. That was actually pretty cool. On another note - when he was captured by all those ropes and arrows - Why did he not use his claws? My friends and I just looked at each other and mouthed the same thing. ""Use your claws, stupid""<br/><br/>OK so this is turning out sounding like a pretty bad movie. It is not exactly bad however the story itself was rather weak and more as a springboard to awesome action-sequences. And let's be honest, who goes to a Wolverine movie expecting lots of deep storytelling, no we go there for the action. I had just hoped that those where not mutually exclusive in this case."

","THE WOLVERINE (2013) *** Hugh Jackman,Tao Okamato, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, Sveltana Khondchenkova, Famke Janssen, Brian Tee, Hal Yamanouchi. Better than anticipated (and frankly unnecessary mutant vehicle) of the always watchable Logan (Jackman still delivering the anti-hero goods) AKA The Wolverine whose reluctance to be a soldier of misfortune continues this time with a seeming debt to a WWII Japanese friend who seeks more than just a reunion: the key to eternity lies within the mutant but at what price to no longer be invincible to the struggles both physically and emotionally. While Mark Bomback and Scott Frank's screenplay tends to bulge at the seams (Japanese Yakuza; the ghost of Jean Grey (the always beguiling Janssen) as an avatar of destiny) director James Mangold anchors the film in reality while still managing some finely tuned action sequences (catching the bullet train is one of the high lights) within reason."
"tenlegdragon","5","16","55","24 July 2013"," Better than Origins, but still not good.
","There's a fight on top of a train and it's pretty awesome. That said, most of everything else just doesn't add up to an exciting, riveting movie. It's better than Origins.<br/><br/>For the record, my X-men knowledge is not spectacular. I have the gist, I own and have read a couple of the comics, I've seen all the movies and I've watched the animated series, most of them, except for the ""Wolverine and the X-men"" cartoon. I went into this movie with just a general idea of what it was supposed to be about. Wolverine in Japan. <br/><br/>I assumed that any story about Wolverine in Japan featuring a woman with daddy/grandaddy issues would be about Yuriko.<br/><br/>Ah... but they already did Yuriko in X2, right?<br/><br/>This movie is not about Yuriko. <br/><br/>I repeat, this movie is not about Yuriko.<br/><br/>Even when you start to think about Yuriko, because that's inevitable, really, keep in mind that it's not about Yuriko. The girl does not end up with claws. Nor does she end up part cyborg. Her name is MAriko, not YUriko. Different people.<br/><br/>Now focusing on what the movie actually is about... <br/><br/>Well, honestly, it's not about anything really. What you see in the trailer is what you get mostly. There are ninjas, a giant samurai robot, a Japanese girl who's very Japanese, another Japanese girl who's the love interest, a lot of sword-fighting, some more ninjas, a man with a crossbow... <br/><br/>There are two mutants aside from Wolverine, both have very lame powers. nothing to get excited about. Wolverine spends a lot of time getting shot, and there's a lot of sword-fighting. A whole lot of sword- fighting. And ninjas with arrows... Lots and lots of ninjas... And warning to the parents, it's not very kid friendly. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of X-men, because you like that magical thrill of seeing people do awesome unbelievable stuff like bend metal with their minds, fly, freeze time, control the weather, shoot lasers from their eyes/arms, teleport in a puff of blue smoke, etc, then this movie isn't for you.<br/><br/>If you're a die-hard Wolverine fan though, and you don't care about the plot as long as Hugh Jackman is on the screen growling, then yay this!<br/><br/>And there's a fight in/on a train that almost makes the whole thing worthwhile. Post credits clip doesn't reveal anything you didn't already know."
"adamscastlevania2","7","3","6","3 September 2014"," Proof that Marvel movies are getting better
","(67%) A refreshing change of pace and tone from all the other superhero movies that are relentlessly made these days that focuses as much attention on character as it does action. This is a well made leap forward over the last Skip Woods written Wolverine picture, with a lot more depth, ideas, and purpose, with Jackman fitting into the role perfectly as he always has from the beginning. The story is pretty simple, yet there are complexities in there dealing with loss of loved ones and human mortality which is handled well in a movie that could have simply not bothered. Overall a good, solid superhero entry to go alongside the best of the bunch."
"zeldafreakx86","8","3","6","27 November 2013"," ""The Wolverine"" is a top 5 superhero flick
","I found ""The Wolverine"" to be a refreshingly different superhero movie. Most of the time, superheros greatly lack any kind of theme other than the typical guy-saves-world plot, and they use huge budgets to create spectacles that, when held to higher movie standards, simply aren't spectacular. This movie keeps the budget, but focuses much more on the eponymous ""Wolverine"" as a human being dealing with the consequences of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and on the consequences of his abilities: he can experience all the pain in the world but, unlike the rest of us, death is not a way out for him.<br/><br/>This movie is a character study on ""The Wolverine,"" and the plot, the villain, and the characters all exist to frame Logan's unique circumstance, his history, and his state-of-mind. The very fact that this movie has an overarching theme, in this movie about living life and the meaning of having or lacking immortality, immediately put this movie head-and-shoulders above almost every superhero movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say it doesn't have flaws. The ""villain"" of the movie, if you can call him/her that, is a non-character whose role or motivation is never established. Many seemingly important characters are incredibly one-dimensional and their decisions can seem arbitrary and lacking in depth. The story takes place in Japan, and some of the ""culture-shock"" parts of the story are stereotypical. Japanese culture is sometimes used to describe away legitimate plot-holes. The romantic interest is forced and didn't seem to be in keeping with Logan's character or the story itself. <br/><br/>But I excuse all of these issues simply because the premise of story is interesting, the plot maintains the theme, and the conclusion is satisfying (if a little predictable). The action sequences are more sparse in this action film, but they are less about spectacle and more about combat-- expect to see acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat rather than big guns and huge explosions. It also has significantly fewer places where deus ex machina save the day; something movies like Thor 2 and Man of Steel had all over the place.<br/><br/>So if you have an attention span and you appreciate a little complexity to the theme of a movie, you will enjoy this film as I did, and forgive its imperfections. If not, move along-- there's no lack of action- packed-but-lacking-any-point movies from which to choose from."
"chriscarlisle25","10","5","13","27 July 2013"," Beginning of a great series of X-men films
","This is such a great movie, especially for a comic book film. I love Marvel movies, but this one and the Avengers have to be the best ones that I have seen yet. The movie has good action sequences, a good story, pretty women, good cast, and a good lead star. Hugh Jackman delivers a good performance as Wolverine. This is the wolverine that people grew up reading about. This is the Wolverine movie that people have wanted to see for many years, and the production crew and directors did a great job on this movie. You can also learn some lessons from this movie, because it has lots of morals. I want to go see this movie again, but this time in 3D. I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars because in my opinion, it is just the beginning of a great series of X-men films."
"nesfilmreviews","6","5","13","26 July 2013"," Jackman is forceful and charismatic, only if he had something more interesting to do here.
","Choosing the artful director James Mangold ""Walk the Line"" (2005) and ""Knight and Day"" (2010), certainly enjoys a much smoother journey to the big screen than its predecessor, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009). The movie adopts a new, visually appealing setting encouraging a change in tone for the heroic comic book character, with a script written by Scott Frank and Mark Bomback that contains themes of mortality, family, honor, and forgiveness. In ""The Wolverine,"" Mangold, Frank, and Bomback introduce new layers to the popular, charismatic mutant with a tortured soul who is making his sixth ""X-Men"" franchise appearance. <br/><br/>It's a character driven plot that takes the Wolverine into new territory, both figuratively and literally. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a wolf without a pack, in a self- imposed exile after the ruinous losses of 2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" The movie takes place mostly in modern-day Japan, where Logan reconnects with a former soldier he shielded from the atom bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945.<br/><br/>Decades later, the immortal mutant is summoned to the side of the man he saved by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), an electric redhead with superior knife skills, and an ability to foresee the future. The dying Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), now a billionaire, offers his savior the chance to lose his immortality, and to live a normal life span without his super-healing powers and incredible strength. Logan finds himself mixed up in the succession between Yashida and the Japanese mob, the Yakuza. The Yakuza is trying to assassinate his beautiful granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto), and Logan chases her down cross-country to protect her from harm. <br/><br/>Drawing on the influence of Samurai films, the action is refreshingly tactile, with well- choreographed fight scenes and some genuinely impressive blockbuster set-pieces. The high point of the movie is the Tokyo bullet train sequence around the halfway mark, which provides some sorely needed thrills -- something which the final showdown fails to provide entirely. The third act is overloaded with CGI driven combat scenes which feels overly artificial given its character driven storyline. By the end of the movie however, nothing has really changed, and Wolverine is more or less the same superhero from two hours earlier. This is Jackman's show entirely, and he is as forceful and charismatic as ever. If only he had something more interesting to do here."

","This is by far one of the best of the saga. I was on the edge of my seat enjoying ever scene and ill I g every second of this movie. I can't wait in the future of more films with Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine.<br/><br/>It has a tight script focusing on Logan as The Wolverine and no so much the X Men. If people were looking for X Men 4 they are not going to see it here. Its better. Logan is his own story and thats what they focused on and thats why I liked it. The major villain in this film isn't the Ninja's or Silver Sam it's Logan himself. If you cant see that then watch it again as a stand alone film not as a film attached to the X Men franchise. Its a look into Logan and why he is who he is. <br/><br/>What I really liked also is that this one stays true to the comics. The Japanese arc of the comics is easily Wolverine's best story and this movie delivers more than justice! Overall I would say best superhero movie of the summer."
"Hellmant","9","4","10","14 August 2013"," Still not the perfectly ideal 'Wolverine' film but it's a damn good one!
","'THE WOLVERINE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The sixth 'X-MEN' film and second revolving around the popular Marvel superhero Wolverine. Hugh Jackman launched his movie star career playing the character (and is now the third highest paid actor in Hollywood), here he plays the role for the sixth time (counting a cameo in 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS'). The movie takes place multiple years after all the other 'X-MEN' films and revolves around Wolverine traveling to Japan to meet a former soldier he saved from a nuclear blast, during World War II, who's now on his deathbed. He finds his healing powers severely suppressed as he must battle well trained samurai and a sexy mutant femme fatale with an immunity to poisons. The film is not only vastly superior to the last 'WOLVERINE' film, 'X-MEN ORIGINS', but it's also an extremely impressive superhero action film given it's the sixth installment in it's franchise. <br/><br/>The film begins in a flashback of 1945 when Wolverine (Jackman), also known as Logan, is being held in a Japanese POW camp near Nagasaki, as it suffers an atomic bombing. He rescues a Japanese officer named Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) who several decades later (during present day) calls on Wolverine for help (at his deathbed). Logan is living alone in the Yukon where he's haunted by nightmares of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen reprising her role), who he had to kill at the end of the film 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND', when a mutant working for Yashida, named Yukio (Rila Fukushima), comes looking for him. She convinces him to come with her to Japan to say goodbye to Yashida before he passes on. Once there Yashida tries to convince Logan to give him his healing powers and live the normal life he always wanted to (as he explains he knows how to transfer his special abilities from one body to another). Logan refuses but finds his powers weakened the next day anyway. He then must battle ruthless samurai and a seductive poisonous mutant who spits poison, called Viper (played by the gorgeous Svetlana Khodchenkova), as he struggles to protect Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), from their attack.<br/><br/>The film is based on the 1982 limited comic series 'Wolverine' by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. It was scripted by Mark Bomback, Scott Frank and Christopher McQuarrie and directed by James Mangold. Mangold also directed the hit films 'WALK THE LINE', '3:10 TO YUMA' and 'KATE & LEOPOLD' (also starring Jackman). The movie is action packed, intense and always involving. Jackman is the perfect Wolverine once again and Khodchenkova makes the perfect seductive villain (she's one of my favorite parts of the movie). It's surprisingly dark and somewhat disturbing for a superhero comic book movie. Mangold did an excellent job with the atmosphere and the screenplay was definitely well written. From what I understand it's pretty faithful to the comics (with a few minor changes here and there) and ultimately lives up to what fans want to see for once. While it's not as good as the first two 'X-MEN' films (which are two of my all time favorite movies) or the last installment, 'FIRST CLASS', it is greatly superior to 'X-MEN ORIGINS' and 'THE LAST STAND'. It's still not the perfectly ideal 'Wolverine' film but it's a damn good one!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxMJBjPRxAc"

"hypestyle","9","4","10","12 August 2013"," Wolverine in the Land of the Rising Sun
","Feature: The Wolverine Studio: 20th Century Fox The Wolverine is Hugh Jackman's fifth feature-length outing as the razor-clawed Marvel Comics superhero. This time around, the brooding avenger is caught up in a plot involving corrupt industrialists, politicians and organized crime in Japan. The movie combines the seemingly disparate genres of comic-book action with film noir with self-assurance and a sense of respect for both.<br/><br/>The film opens with the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki during World War II. Here, Jackman's Logan—the Wolverine—is a prisoner of war isolated in a deep pit. Japanese soldier Shingen (Ken Yamamura) frees him, only to be rescued himself by Wolverine as the pit becomes an impromptu bomb shelter. Decades later, an almost completely hirsute Logan— having nightmares from his days as an X-Man—is living as a hermit in the Canadian Yukon (his feral mutant instincts apparently endear him to local fauna like grizzly bears.) A confrontation in a bar is interrupted by feisty swordswoman Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who brings an offer from the elderly Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada), now a billionaire tech giant in Japan.<br/><br/>It seems Shingen is dying, and wants to offer his thanks to Logan for saving his life: Shingen claims to have developed a means to siphon Logan's mutant healing and longevity powers into himself— giving Logan an end to his ""curse"" of outliving everyone he loves. Inevitably, in Logan's world, nothing's that simple. Logan barely gets a bad-night's sleep (thanks to Svetlana Khodchenkova's henchwoman Viper) before he has to deal head-on with Yakuza gangsters who want Shingen's granddaughter Mariko (a luminous Tao Okamato) dead.<br/><br/>Complicating matters is the fact that Mariko's dad (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) and her prosecutor fiancé (Brian Tee) may be in on the murder plot. Worst of all, Logan's healing power seems to be failing on its own. Wolverine's newfound vulnerability is felt through much of the film, as he now winces and limps with every gunshot, knife and sword wound that is leveled his way (blood, both literal and figurative, heavily informs the narrative.)<br/><br/>Walk the Line's James Mangold directs the film (the final script is credited to Mark Bomback and Scott Frank), and the filmmakers give Wolverine the solo adventure he deserves. The romance-on-the-run between Logan and Mariko is handled admirably—she thinks him an uncouth gaijin at first, but comes to love the gruff brawler with a heart of gold. The film's setting avoids fetishizing its Far East backdrop (though a fetish motel is visited) and gives its supporting characters deeply-felt—if severely misguided—motivations driven by adherence to tradition and self-sacrifice.<br/><br/>The Wolverine may or may not be the last appearance by the character—witness the mid-credits epilogue—but if this is Jackman's final bow as Wolverine, he was given an engaging send-off.<br/><br/>Rating: A-"

The movie running time is 126 mins and there is not a single scene which would be remembered after leaving the theater. Background score is ineffective. Editing is loose.

"wsills8","7","4","10","27 July 2013"," One of the Best X-Men Movies to Date
","The Wolverine is Fox's 2012 superhero attempt to bring in success, much like 2011's X-Men: First Class. Unlike every other X-Men film to date, The Wolverine takes place entirely out of the U.S. with parts in Canada and the rest in Tokyo, Japan. Also unlike every other X-Men film to date, Wolverine is the only X-Man in this one as he battles a evil Tokyo family, Viper, and The Silver Samurai. This film definitely takes risks, but unlike Wolverine's last solo film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the risks pay off big time. The script and story are both very believable and realistic apart from a few instances of predictability and some corny dialogue. Also, The acting is very good. This, in my opinion, is Hugh Jackman's finest outing playing the lone wolf Wolverine. Also, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, and Svetlana Khodchenkova give very good performances. Other good performances come from Famke Janssen, Will Yun Lee, and Hal Yamanouchi. The story is filled with depth and darkness, and the action in this film never fails to amaze, especially the train fight. The cinematography is very good apart from some shaky camp, the production design is incredible as everything is gorgeous, the costume designs are very good as well, and the musical score by Marco Beltrami is very intense and epic, much like Hans Zimmer's for this year's Man of Steel. The direction by James Mangold was spot-on as he takes a deeper, darker, and more intense look into the lore of Wolverine as it is believable that he might actually die in the end. All in all, this is a very, VERY good movie and take on the Wolverine in a darker, grittier manner with very good acting from Hugh Jackman and the crew and impressive action.<br/><br/>My Grade = A (8.7/10)<br/><br/>Also, stick around for the credits as you will be pleased with one of the best after-the-credits scenes in a long while."

","I just loved The Wolverine. I thought it was very well written and the impressive cast really delivered! Hugh Jackman finally gets a full film to bring the character to the next level. It's been delivered in flashes before but this entire movie is the Wolverine that I wanted to see. This is the character that I grew up with and have enjoyed since youth. Mangold should be commended for giving the film a subdued yet intense flavor. I think they captured the vibe of the classic Japanese story from the books wonderfully. They delivered an intelligent plot that featured the fantastic grounded in a believable reality. One of the difficulties with the character is placing him in situations where he is in true danger. That wasn't an issue here as they managed to intelligently do this on numerous occasions in a smart fashion. I was very impressed with the many great moments and fine character arcs in this one. The action is dark, perfectly suiting the character and the PG-13 rating was pushed right to the edge if not beyond it.<br/><br/>I disagree with those that say the villains are poorly utilized. Viper may have been one dimensional but I consider her a throw away tool when the entire plot is taken in to consideration. Yashida was perfectly utilized and his actions not only drive the film but flesh out everyone's motivations perfectly. Shingen was everything the character needed to be.<br/><br/>The true strength in the supporting cast is both Mariko and Yukio. Amazing renditions both.<br/><br/>That bullet train scene DID live up to the hype. Short but oh so sweet! The best adventure film of the year. Yes, BETTER than Iron Man 3."

","Finally today was the day the Wolverine came out I had been waiting since the first trailer back in March or April out of all the comic book movies that have come out this was the one i most waiting for and here is what I thought.<br/><br/>The look of the movie was fine when he was in japan they really captured the essence and authentic feel of the country it didn't feel like it was manufactured by the studio. As well the location gave it a some what darker tone and more serious look which made it more interesting to watch the action set pieces were OK i feel watching it that the character of wolverine in this movie was more able to fight and looked more like a man who could fight in the other movies the fight sequences to me were horrible and looked like a mess where as in this movie they were well thought out. <br/><br/>The character of Wolverine was a little better but very much the same Jackmen clearly worked extremely hard in the gym this time round he did a great job as he always does.<br/><br/>the girl with the red hair was fine along with his love interest fine.<br/><br/>Viper was horrible villain and horribly portrayed by the actress whoever she is.<br/><br/>jean grey why was she in this in the first place she serves no purpose at all.<br/><br/>and finally Wolverine vs silver samurai robot was just plain insulting to see dumbing down like that when it came really close to being a really great film they do this it's disgusting Marvel should be ashamed."

","So after the muddled disappointing mess of X-Men Origins: Wolverine & the awesome return to form in X-Men: First Class; Wolverine returns to the screen in a bad adventure that almost doesn't seem like an X-Men movie.<br/><br/>The plot starts off as almost a Highlander movie with Logan feeling the pain of immortality and being offered a chance at normal life and death. It then becomes a Japanese crime thriller before turning back into a full-blown sci-fi battle to the death.<br/><br/>The plot works well to make us feel for Wolverine and his loss. He goes from burnt-out soldier to full-on warrior again during the story.<br/><br/>The Jean Grey parts work OK but they tie this movie to the blah that was X-Men: The Last Stand. And the mid-credits scene does indeed set up X-Men: Days of Future Past. So you understand why there have been no announcements about Famke Janseen, James Marsden or Rebecca Romijn in XMDOFP.<br/><br/>Over all the movie is not bad."

","...at least I could enjoy Japan, the cute and the beautiful girl, a really fantastic train fight scene, the play of Hugh Jackman* and partly the background story.<br/><br/>Unluckily director Mangold is not the right guy for that kind of movie. He seems to be more the character guy, not the action one. Although there is quite a lot potential for amazing fight scenes, what he makes out of it is more like a storm in a bathtub, than a hurricane. But as already mentioned except the train scene! Usually I just need the right amount of action (for example Transformers is too much for me), but this movie is lacking too much. Even an unsure and insecure, broken and lost Wolverine Jackman can't make up for this.<br/><br/>In the beginning you see a depressed Wolverine/Logan, that gives some new insight. If you like Japan, you can find a lot of truth in the second part, shortcut, but somehow realistic. The climatic fighting scene in the last act on the other hand has the usual sci-fi/fantasy touch and is just silly and boring. <br/><br/>To sum it up: This movie has good intentions, some good scenes, but is like the Japanese Alps: Up and down, up and down. If you don't watch it, you have nothing missed.<br/><br/>*compared to other superhero actors, but he looses to ""Iron Man"" Robert Downey Jr."

Yashida, who is dying of cancer, wants Logan to accompany Yukio to Japan so that he may repay his life debt.<br/><br/>In Tokyo, Logan meets Yashida's son, Shingen, and granddaughter, Mariko. There, Yashida offers to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his own body, thus saving Yashida's life and alleviating Logan of his immortality, which Logan views as a curse. Logan refuses and prepares to leave the following day.

","Unfortunately the very -considerably- good X-men series are culminating in a series of rather disappointing and uninspired wolverine tribute wannabes. This movie leaves so much to be desired, that at some point you cannot help but wonder: ""where are they going with this?"". The answer only reveals itself in the last 3 minutes of the movie, following the first end-credits. I wouldn't want to spoil it for everyone who has not seen the movie yet, so I have this to share: this is a watchable movie, entertaining as far as effects go, filled with plot-holes, leaving you with a taste of ""we-had-to-make-this-movie-as-stipulated-in-our-contract"" in the mouth.

","We all compare The Wolverine to the previous film - Origins. And we should. I was afraid it will be a disaster like that. We all were. But it turns out it was better, it was a lot more exciting and ""realistic"". And it's not only me saying it. The plot was a lot deeper. It's quite popular now to have a plot where the main character goes back to basics (Dark Knight Rises, Iron Man 3), but either way, it was still fun. You see Wolverine after the events of X-Men 3, after his loss, after his departure. He does not want to be the Wolverine anymore, but he just can't stop being a hero. Don't compare it to the comic books, don't compare it to previous films. It's a good sequel and it was the movie we wanted.

I'd avoid watching this. The Asian Actors arn't that bad, but stereotyped as usual. most everyone is a ninja or part of a gang. Viper is a mutant, (in the comics she's not.

","Please take 5 min to see if u agree with me<br/><br/>Um Where do I begin. There is just too much flaws in this movie. 1. The story 2. The characters 3. Story yup story again.<br/><br/>1. The story is just plain n stupid, no heart warming or touching of any source. While watching the movie as a Wolverine fan, the story just seem to b writing by a non wolverine fan. It's like the writer doesn't even know how his power work. His body is like a fruit, everyone slice and stab into in every fighting scenes. He lucky that he has his healing power or else he dead in every fight. That just show that he not a good fighter. OH I for got, even without his healing power, he got shot like 10 time, even to the chest n he still move around like he has his healing power. What the fuk was that about. <br/><br/>2. Many of the character in this movie are just lame n stupid. The viper woman is just god damn stupid n does not fit into anything. She just going around poison people and act like a bitch through the whole movie. where does she fit in, what in it for her. Secondly a giant silver samurai, oh it turn out to be grandpa, the guy he saved at the beginning of the movie. The red hair girl, oh my god, she is just an ugly Japanese girl. They could at least hire a prettier girl to look at. Damn she ugly. 3. I cant seem to like the story at all. The man he saved turn out he wanted to steal wolverine power. The grandpa is evil, the father wanted his own daughter dead, oh get this, he wanted her dead because the will is on her name, from grandpa to her. The daughter kill grandpa at the end, but during the movie she break apart because he is in bed rest. At one point she wanted to run off a clip, suicide attempt. At the end she chose wolverine over her own grandpa that she been breaking apart from. She throw wolverine own claw like a knife into grandpa head. Who the fuk does that to there grandpa. The really sick part about his movie is that wolverine hooking up with the grandpa grand daughter. Let see he saved grandpa 40 years ago, so grandpa could go home and have kids, and his kid have kid which is his grand daughter and wolverine fuk his grand daughter. Sick Sick <br/><br/>Over all not a bad movie, lot of good action, but story is just a bunch of pot hole."

","There is not one wasted line, visual, camera angle or wasted development in this entire movie. Everything serves to either advance the plot or flesh out and develop a character. It was smart, tight and lean and superbly done. I truly think that this is the best movie of the summer. How could you not like it? It doesn't payoff prior installments or set up future ones, it's a great film all by itself. It seems to exist almost out of time, for the simple purpose of pitting its iconic mutant anti-hero against the perfect threats. Who doesn't like samurais, ninjas, and vicious yakuza thugs? You can still see the attempt to tie this film to events from the trilogy but it all works neatly and tightly and you really need not have seen those other films. The Wolverine is certainly a movie that I want to see again. It's one heck of an entertaining and smart movie."

However at the time of his need and due to the trap set by the so called old friend, he has lost some and therefore the struggle is twice as intense and so are the action scenes.<br/><br/>It has become a bit of trend in Hollywood recently for the superhero to face struggles and it was with joy that in this film, the effort of making it more character driven did not come at the expense of the cinematic enjoyment.

"3xHCCH","7","6","19","25 July 2013"," A Movie With So Much Angst
","""The Wolverine"" begins with a scene at the end of World War II with the bombing of Nagasaki. Under such harsh circumstances, Logan (Hugh Jackman) strikes a friendship with a Japanese soldier, Yashida (Ken Yamamura). <br/><br/>Fast forward to the present time, Yashida (now played by Haruhito Yamanouchi), now the taipan of a big business enterprise (on his amazing futuristic deathbed), summons Logan to Japan to say his parting words before he dies. When he gets there though, Logan got more than what he bargained for, as his very immortality lay on the line.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is the perfect Wolverine. By now, we all know looks the part and acts the part from previous X-Men films, and this film is no different. Logan will experience something new from this film that challenges him like never before, and Jackman was more than able to project that challenge. We will feel his pain. He carried this heavy film like no other actor could.<br/><br/>Logan will have two Japanese ladies behind him. First is Mariko (the beautiful Tao Okamoto), the statuesque granddaughter and future heir of the Yashida fortune. Second is Yukio (the anime-cute Rila Fukushima), a quirky red-haired ward of Yashida who was also a very able fighter. Both ladies performed very well in their respective roles.<br/><br/>This film is a very heavy drama with occasional bursts of exciting action. Some fans looking forward to nonstop slash fights may be disappointed. The best fight scene was that one on the roof of the bullet train, and that happens in the first hour. I also enjoyed all the well-orchestrated Japanese-style sword fights and archery scenes, but these were fewer than I expected.<br/><br/>Save for a brief scene about a bath near the start, there was absolutely no relief from the overwhelming angst that pervades this movie. Everybody was frowning or angry almost the whole time. And this film lasts for more than two hours. Some viewers may find all this rage too much to bear.<br/><br/>I found this a very well-made film by Director James Mangold. I liked the intense Wolverine it painted. I liked the Japanese setting and cultural references. I liked the artsy scenes featuring Famke Janssen as Jean Grey. I really like the extra scene during the final credits, now that is really exciting. <br/><br/>However, as a whole the tone may have been too turgid or intense to be considered entertaining. Fans should go watch it as it is a very good film, but do not expect it to be as commercial as the other X-Men films for the average moviegoers. 7/10."

A weird mutant villain, poorly portrayed and her motivation was lacking any reason. The robot thing was confusing and just doesn't make any sense. <br/><br/>There were a few action scenes that had some laughs, but for the most part it was disgusting action. not genuine at all. <br/><br/>the performance of Hugh Jackman, honestly felt fake. I couldn't see the old awesome, funny LOgan because he wasn't there. He wasn't the character, he was just acting it. with those ridiculously questionable eyebrows and extreme vein problem. I mean it felt fake. i think hes overdue. i mean, its like a jack sparrow sirdeal. overdue. they could've changed actors. why not? they do it all the time with Superman, Batman, and Spiderman 3 of the most iconic superheroes ever. But no, these marvel guys, which half of them i didn't even know until they made movies about them, are untouchable and special you cant change their actors. <br/><br/>The directing was entertaining but it cant hold up this dreadfully incoherent mess of a storyline. i didn't get it, confusing, and a waste of my money. i promised i wouldn't see this because i knew it would be awful. well i saw it because it was a 61/100. better than the hobbit?! okay, shouldn't be bad. another wasted movie. <br/><br/>im done with garbage that i know is gonna be bad.

"lisafordeay","5","2","4","29 February 2016"," My review for The Wolverine
","This happened to be on Channel 4 last night and I decided to watch bits and pieces of it. The film is another attempt of Wolverine's backstory and this time the film opens in Japan where Wolverine(played by Hugh Jackman)is saving someones live from an atomic bomb and we later see Wolverine dreaming about Jean Grey(Famkee Jansen)who died in X Men 2 but was resurrected in X Men 3 Last Stand only for Wolverine to kill her in the process. He keeps getting dreams of her and is now living it rough in a cave where he meets a bear. We later see him teaming up with some Chinese girl and he tries to protect another girl's life in Japan as her life is in danger. There is also this guy who is dying apparently and the old man wants Wolverine's powers but he declines. Eventually he does lose his immortality for a bit and its up to Wolverine to retrive his powers again and save the day. <br/><br/>Overall I found this film OK. Its not in my honest opinion as good as X Men Orgin's Wolverine as that film had a proper backstory but a lot of critics hated that film saying it was all over the place. The director of The Wolverine is of course James Mangold who also directed the romantic fantasy comedy also starring Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan Kate & Leopold another movie that I love to watch and consider my favourite Hugh Jackman movie. Also Mangold directed Walk The Line. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is Wolverine,like Micheal Keaton as Batman or Jim Carrey as The Mask,I cannot picture anybody else as Wolverine as he plays Wolverine with so much power you think that Jackman is a bad ass but in reality his the complete opposite and sometimes I wish Jackman would star in more light-hearted films like Kate & Leopold where his not stabbing people with his metal claws. But hey if you love X Men and the charcther Wolverine than check it out.<br/><br/>Not the best in the franchise but still its an OK movie.<br/><br/>5/10"
"wcslam","3","2","4","30 December 2015"," Good message, horrendous execution
","I went into this movie hoping that maybe IMDb's current 6.7 rating might not be entirely accurate, and maybe it would be better. I love most of the other X-Men movies, so my hopes were high. I was right; the rating wasn't accurate, but The Wolverine merits a far lower rating. <br/><br/>Though ""The Wolverine"" had a good message of appreciating what you have while you have it, it is overshadowed by absurd amounts of blood, gore, and violence that really puts it more in the R range than the PG-13 range. Even the overarching point of the movie, Wolverine's struggle to come to terms with his immortality, is never really resolved. He only re-accepts his invulnerability because the current situation demands that he be an unstoppable killing machine. I understand some people say that ""this is the Wolverine audiences were waiting for,"" but I'm not sure I personally can like a main character who guts his opponents first and asks questions later.<br/><br/>Wolverine's struggle against his 'inner demons' also comes to nothing by the end of the movie. We get a gripping intro with his chronic nightmare of killing Jean Grey over and over, which could have been a very good plot device if it had followed through on itself. However, every other time he has a nightmare, Jean just ends up giving him vague advice or talking him into killing himself. And then, to cap it all off, Wolverine kisses and sleeps with Mariko. Having just blatantly disregarded what appeared to be undying love for Jean, he then proceeds to, very hypocritically, attack Mariko's fiancée because he was cheating on her. <br/><br/>Then comes the self-vivisection scene. While desperate times do call for desperate and sometimes violent measures, I feel like the amount of blood and gore in this scene was unnecessary. It felt like the movie was trying to be too dark for its' own good. We also never get a clear explanation of how Viper kissing Wolverine at the beginning resulted in a robotic spider clinging to his heart. <br/><br/>A few plot details are finally revealed in the final battle that make the movie feel like a little less of a blood-horror movie. Unfortunately, the movie leaves itself very little time to turn Yashida instead of Viper into the main villain. The Silver Samurai reveal felt sort of forced, having only been introduced as a possible threat in the previous scene as a blueprint on the floor of Yashida's home. Then, somehow, Yashida is able to draw out Wolverine's genetic mutation through his claws, even though we saw earlier it was heart problems that kept the healing powers from working. Then Wolverine once again makes an unnecessary kill, as Yashida is dying a painful death anyway, and Wolverine decides it needs to be more painful and stabs him with his crude bone claws. <br/><br/>The addition of the bone claws themselves also opens up a plot-hole that hurts ""Days of Future Past;"" Wolverine somehow needed to regain his metal claws. To be fair, ""Days of Future Past"" could have explained that, but in light of the gravity of the situation, it's understandable that it simply ignores this rather troubling-to-fix issue. <br/><br/>Besides the moral message I mentioned earlier, the one redeeming part of this graphic kill-fest is the after-credits scene, showing Magneto and Professor X as allies recruiting Wolverine to fight an enemy that is, according to Magneto, more dangerous than anything they've faced before.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a lead-in to the next movie, however fantastic that movie may have ended up being, cannot be one of only two redeeming qualities in a movie. While I love seeing a good bit of Wolverine action, this movie took it too far and sacrificed having a likable character for a bloody action show."
"g-bodyl","9","2","4","27 October 2014"," Wolverine's Character Profile!
","Now when X-Men Origins: Wolverine came out in 2009, I was one of the handful who actually enjoyed it despite its flaws. Now flash forward four years later and we get another Wolverine standalone movie, but this time the film takes place after the events of 2006's The Last Stand, which I liked. I also liked how this film is purposely slow as the movie tries to explain the deep feelings of our protagonist and his desire to die. I liked the new direction of the film and while it takes it time, there are several great action scenes and one involving a fight on top of a bullet train.<br/><br/>James Mangold's film starts off with The Wolverine saving a Japanese soldier's life during the dropping of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki. Flash forward many years later, Wolverine is living life as a mountain man feeling guilty of Jean Grey's death. When he gets the call to come to Japan, he meets the soldier again who is now an old man near death. The old man offers him a way out of his grief and his immortal being. Now can the Wolverine accept a mortal life? <br/><br/>This film does not require a whole slew of A-list stars and we don't get them other than the iconic Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Hugh was fantastic as always and he plays the part well with even more scowls and brooding which we come to expect. Famke Janssen makes several appearances as Wolverine's now deceased love. Two Japanese actresses, Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukushima, are excellent as Wolverine's female companions. The villain of the film, played by Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova, was perhaps the weakest part of the film. Her portrayal as Viper was not that convincing.<br/><br/>Overall, The Wolverine is an excellent character study of a flawed man full of guilt and is longing for being mortal. Some people complain about how the film is slow and boring. Unfortunately people don't like a personal character study these days. What little action there is, it's pretty impressive. Even if the final action scene is repetitive of films from the past, but it was well done. As a character study, this film excels. I rate this film 9/10."
"smg242","9","2","4","14 July 2014"," One of the most underrated movies of 2013...
","I didn't watch The Wolverine in theaters, and boy do I regret it now. The Wolverine is different from most of the other X-Men movies. It's probably the least significant of all of them, as it has virtually NO impact on any part of the main story of the X-Men (apart from a post- credits scene). What it DOES have impact on, though, is the story of Logan's journey as the Wolverine.<br/><br/>This is not your average comic-book film. It's mature, realistic, gritty, and most of all grisly, something even the Dark Knight trilogy wasn't. Not for the squeamish at all. But, it's an unforgettable tale of a warrior and his journey, and the sacrifices he makes to do good.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about The Wolverine, is probably some of the dialogue, which was crass and profane for no other reason other than being crass and profane. For example, Yukio says to Logan, ""Don't be a d**k."" I know the movie's trying to be gritty and mature, but dialogue like this just sounds silly. Also, the twist at the end is pretty far- fetched, but I don't see a problem in Adamantium getting cut. When a metal is heated till it lights red, it can very well melt a metal of the same type. I do think that Viper was unnecessary, though.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the film is brilliant, and does an amazing job at telling a tragic tale of a soldier going through so much for justice. Director James Mangold sometimes uses peculiar imagery, that reminds me of the 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner. It definitely adds to a film of this size and scope. The action is great too, some really sweet martial-arts mixed with Wolverine's rage and a visceral train-fighting sequence as well.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is most probably the best comic-book movie of 2013. It's sad, moving, but complete and engaging. I don't think I'll have to state anything in particular about Hugh Jackman. He was the Wolverine, is the Wolverine, and will be Wolverine forever. I'd hate to see anyone replace him.<br/><br/>Better than Origins by a milestone."

""It's a curse"", ""I hate being a super hero"", ""It's so hard to have all this power"", ""it bites so much to be able to kick anyone's but"". Boohoo,cry me a river. In the X-men I grew up reading, Logan kicked major but. He was tough, mean, nasty and edgy. Constantly in Cyclops face over the smallest thing. The Logan in Wolverine is just a kitten with a hang over, who walks around hating him self. This is pretty much what he does in this movie, can't even fight a few ninjas, which in the comics he went through like a hot knife through butter.Seem to recall he actually enjoyed slicing and dicing ninjas. And where's the blood? He slices and dices people left and right but there's no blood, they just fall down and than they get up again. (I'm pretty sure he hit the same Japanese mafia guy 3 different times.) This is very far from the Japanese saga I grew up reading, where Mairiko was about Logan's age (40-50ish, and her brother was the silver samurai,with no super power,just a sword and armor. And the girl who works as he's sidekick;Yukio, didn't have any special powers, as far as i can recall from the comics:she was athletic and had some throwing knives,that was about it And what was this viper chick doing in the story? There was no point in her being there, she was suppose to be some femme fatal, but I really didn't get her role in this saga. They didn't reveal her motive for helping out the bad guys. I get the impression they take a whole bunch of different stories and just mix em together into a movie script.<br/><br/>The story line didn't make sense at all. I was a bit disappointed and was hoping it would have more action in it,the best part of X-men 2 was when they attacked the school building,and Logan/wolverine got to go berserk.I was missing more of that here.

"XweAponX","10","2","4","24 December 2013"," The 1982 Mini-Series finally on Film
","This film deserved much better than it got, I think this was one of the most true X-Men related films of them all. To the Boneheads who are spouting ""Who Wrote This?"" - Well, blame Chris Claremont and Frank Miller.<br/><br/>I've got a copy of that first Wolverine Mini-Series, original printing.<br/><br/>If you take this story and strip out the Mechanized Silver Samurai and Viper alterations, it's that exact story. The main characters are all there: Yukio,Mariko, Viper, Shingen, The Silver Samurai, and The Black Hand (Later referred to as ""The Hand"" in the books).<br/><br/>There are also elements from early 90's Wolverine arcs, as Wolverine, when he had been stripped of Adamantium by Magneto in X-Men (Vol II) #25 and Wolverine #75, he wandered the world carrying the Sword of The Yashida Clan, which is shown in this film - A Sword made out of Metal from a Meteor, which Wolverine used to incapacitate the evil ""Bloodsport/Bloodscream"" later on in the series and later entrusted back to the Human Silver Samurai.<br/><br/>There is even a nod to ""Cyber"" - An evil Mutant who was completely encased in Adamantium, who was the only enemy Wolverine really feared- Who was killed in Wolverine #100, his Adamantium leeched by Tyler Summers (Cyclop's Grandson from his son Cable) which he intended to put back into Logan but Logan refused to go through the bonding process and this reverted his genes and gave him an animal-like appearance.<br/><br/>I don't remember the time-line much, it has after all been 30 years. Around that same time Professor X's son, Legion, went back in time to kill Magneto but kills Professor X instead, causing the ""M'kraan Crystal"" of the Shi'ar to crack, bending reality, thus causing the ""Age of Apocalypse"", an Alternate Timeline where it was all changed: And the Goal of that X-Men, led by Magneto, was to repair the M'kraan Crystal. This arc was done over 6 months worth of Alternate X-Men titles.<br/><br/>Eventually all these arcs lead up to ""Days of Future Past"": And indeed, there is a huge reference to this at the end of the film.<br/><br/>If anyone had followed the 1988 (Volume II) Wolverine, set in ""Madripoor"", they would remember two fellows, Roughhouse and Bloodsport who hounded Wolverine incognito as ""Master Patch"" - And so I initially thought that this rendition of ""Viper"" (Svetlana Khodchenkova) was a female version of Bloodsport, as Bloodsport was the only enemy that could suck out Wolverine's Healing factor. And, as Bloodsport/Scream's goal was to suck all of the life out of Logan, this is apt as the elder head of the Yashida Clan takes on this goal.<br/><br/>But that was not the case, although Viper's Ability to weaken Logan's Mutant Healing factor was similar to Bloodsport/Scream, she was her own villain with her own agenda.<br/><br/>As far as the film, this was the best X-Men related film since 2000, and as much as I liked ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" I like this one much more: Because none of the other films really got into who Logan really is, the fatalistic, tired of living Wolverine- Who although too tired to live, and not caring about much, because so much had been taken from him, he still fights as hard as he can.<br/><br/>And THAT is why I loved the Comic Book Series, and why I like this installment of the films. Because, in their own way, Marvel is pulling all of the best story arcs and sticking them into these movies.<br/><br/>And everything looks very good here, Hugh Jackman doesn't look much different than in the other films. This ""Weakened Wolverine"" was an interesting twist, allowed us to get to the dark aspects of the character."

","First off: Spoilers? Why bother? People don't read reviews for recommendations, whether they should go see the film; they read them to confirm that the movie was as bad as they perceived it.<br/><br/>Now, let me admit: I took the bait willingly, consciously, despite better knowledge or foreboding. Mea culpa, but why break a lifelong habit, even if it's a bad one? I paid my handful of dollars, stood in line with my fellow zombies (some which were muttering something along the lines, ""boy, this is going to be worst then the first Wolverine-movie""), filed into those mortuary-halls called cinema and, well, pretty much waited for a miracle. You know what happens to people who wait for miracles? They'll get disappointed because miracles only happen to other people who they know only through hearsay, because miracles defy all logic.<br/><br/>But why would we expect more than the usual, well-worn out action-fare? Why expect scriptwriters to spend valuable time to compose a half-engaging script and fix the most obvious plot holes? Like I said: the suckers (like myself) come cheap and will swallow the bait nevertheless; it takes only the magic words ""Wolverine"", ""Hugh Jackman"" and ""Sequel"".<br/><br/>Obviously, this was meant (or rather marketed) as a deep study of the man-slash-mutant who is indestructible and (possibly) immortal. There was more depth and insight into the Wolverine-character in those scenes, where Wolverine and Rogue drive in Wolverines pick-up-truck in the first movie. The dream-sequences with Jean Grey, as pointless and tedious as they were – there was more depth in Mystiques and Wolverines cameo-appearances in the First-Class-movies (and, forgive me the wordplay, ""more class""). A movie where Wolverine looses his powers and spends a good deal of the time bleeding, hurting and whining, isn't that what we all rooted for? Like the last Highlander-film, where the immortals loose their immortality and that Future-Superman-film, when Superman will loose his powers through an overdose of kryptonite? And as for the ""antagonist"" Silver Samurai: Did we really expect that rather interesting character from the comics to make an appearance or did we fore-smell that it would be the obvious: A huge, Transformer-like robot made of Adamantium, with grandfather sitting inside? Don't get me started on the Viper-character; neither ""actress"" nor character is worth the electronic ink.<br/><br/>I could go on with a list of complaints, but feel that this has been covered by a good percentage of reviewers (and why even bother writing another review? Like I mentioned: I stick to my bad habits, which include writing reviews about the last X-Men-movie I saw). Let me just state one more observation: the haircut they gave Jackman was ridiculous and reminded me more of some old The Three Stooges clip.<br/><br/>Plus: one reason I have rooted for this film was Hiroyuki Sanada, whom I consider one of the finest actors that Japan has produced in recent years and – given time and the right roles – might one day become something like the Asian Christopher Lee. What on earth was I dreaming, thinking or smoking, believing for one second that his role or talent might not be utterly wasted? By the end of the film, I had convinced myself that I had come to the cinema for one sole reason: the after-credit-scene. Surely, Magneto and Dr. X would have a cameo in this scene. They did. Neither of them aged very well (but then again, who does?) Maybe Magneto will fix Wolverines horribly stumpy claws in the next movie, maybe they'll put a little more effort into the next X-Men-movie and allow the Wolverine-franchise to fade away.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm just being naïve.<br/><br/>4/10"

","James Mangold directed this sixth ""X-Men"" entry, though the second to focus primarily on Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) which is set after the events of 'The Last Stand', as Wolverine, now living a nomadic existence in the wilderness, is located by a Japanese woman who tells him that a (now) wealthy Japanese man whose life he had saved in WWII(when the two atom bombs were dropped) is now dying, and wants to repay his life debt by offering him a chance to relinquish his immortality by transferring it to him through a new process. Wolverine respectfully refuses, but events spiral out-of-control as someone wants the man's daughter and heir dead, and also wants Wolverine's healing power, which threatens his indestructibility... Hugh Jackman is more than capable of carrying this interesting picture alone with nice Japan locations and story, which will push him in a new direction, and(if you stay through the end credits) into his next ""X-Men"" adventure."
"Marco-1984","3","2","4","5 December 2013"," Connect the dots
","First off something positive: I love Hugh Jackman, both as an actor in general and especially as the very incarnation of Wolverine! Just look at this hunk of manly manliness who at the same is so in touch with himself that he can convincingly express a variety of fine emotions - what an actor! The movie gets three stars solely for Jackman's marvelous primeval presence which he skilfully balances with some degree of vulnerability, grief, affection and anger.<br/><br/>As for the rest, i.e. the movie itself: It's set in Japan and consists of an exhaustive mash of every single stereotype and platitude there is about this country and its culture. The (far from complete) list in more or less chronological order reads: WW II, harakiri, atom bomb, swords, sword-wielding schoolgirls, industrial tycoon clan, dojo, ronin, patriarchy, face shields, more suicide, yakuza, ninjas, more swords, pachinko, shinkansen, love hotels, racism (gaijin!), more ninjas, samurai stuff and still more swords, ninjas again (even on motorcycles!) and to put the cherry on the cake: a samurai armor suit! The plot is best summarized as a connect-the-dots of these elements and mixed with Logan's grief and lack purpose. <br/><br/>It's not always clear who the villain is supposed to be since the focus changes several times. Shingen the ambitious son, the Yakuza (just henchmen I guess), Viper (who is just some exotic but dispensable prop in this plot), Noburo (Minister of Justice, just your typical corrupt, ambitious and hedonistic politician), Harada (who conveniently turns good guy again after being stabbed in the leg - how cathartic! - and then continues to jump around like a cat), or Yashida, who - unsurprisingly - plotted to gain immortality all along! So take a pick! <br/><br/>The love story isn't too bad if you ignore the obvious erotic calculations of pairing a brutish force of nature (Logan) with a delicate fragile woman (Mariko). It doesn't evolve to much and mainly serves Logan to get over his guilt and anxiety over Jean's death. So this is also optional.<br/><br/>Half the action scenes are good, with three exceptions: The scene on the shinkansen roof goes way over the top with physical plausibility (the part with them accelerating all the time). The scene with the snow plow truck: The grisly humor wasn't totally lost on me, but for my taste way too implausible again. Those inaudible cat-like ninjas, that were doing somersaults just for the heck of it 15 minutes earlier, being surprised by that truck and getting run over? Finally the fight between Wolverine (after regaining his healing abilities) and Shingen (with samurai armor, katana and wakizashi...): I expected a real fight, blade against claw. Instead we have Shingen slashing away at Logan who takes hit after hit, serving as a sword dummy. At this point of the story they should have shifted the focus away from Logan's (in)vulnerability, which was to this point done for 90 minutes, back to him being Wolverine, the guy with the long sharp claws, the fighting machine.<br/><br/>I kinda hated this movie a little but still don't regret seeing it thanks to Hugh Jackman. I'd recommend it to fans of him and the X-Men franchise - otherwise: avoid it!"
"Crankgorilla","6","2","4","9 December 2013"," Like Shaking a Soda and Popping the Cap
","It starts off exciting enough but by midway through it fizzes out and ends up just making a mess everywhere. Jackman is great as Wolverine and his dedication to the role is admirable. I would have liked to seen the story grounded a little more as the world this movie exists in is definitely not a real one. Fight scenes are abundant and well done but a little too numerous and non-consequential. Plot annoyances arrive in the form of an unnecessary love interest and a giant ninja robot. Also, everyone in this film is a ninja because, you know, everyone from Japan is. If you like ridiculous action and overly staged fight scenes, then this will appeal. It feels like something a 15yr old would like, and I suppose that is where the target audience would be. Not a bad flick and worth the view if you are a fan of the Wolverine."
"tomgillespie2002","5","2","4","20 November 2013"," Jackson impresses, but I doubt The Wolverine will linger for long in people's minds
","After one failed origin story with the dismal X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Hugh Jackman's short-tempered Logan AKA Wolverine is given another chance at a stand alone movie. With the X-Men movies generally hit-and-miss, mainly due to an over-abundance of mutants, director James Mangold has taken the story into unfamiliar territory. There's no army of mutants baddies for the mutton-chopped hero to slice apart, nor is he held back and forced into the background by his fellow X-Men. The Wolverine takes us and Wolverine to a different continent entirely, only to find he even has enemies in Japan.<br/><br/>Tortured by the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Logan (Hugh Jackman) is long-haired and bearded and hiding out in Yukon, Canada. After an incident in a local bar, he is befriended by the samurai sword-wielding Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who has been sent by an old friend to recruit Wolverine. The old friend is Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), a Japanese soldier rescued by Logan during the bombing of Nagasaki in 1945. Yashida is on the verge of death, and in his search for elongating his life, wants to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his own body. When Logan refuses, Yashida passes the following day, only for the funeral to be attacked by yakuza gangsters looking to kidnap Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and heir to his billion-dollar company.<br/><br/>It's a flimsy plot to say the least, and not one that successful, multi- million dollar blockbusters are founded on. And here lies the biggest problem for The Wolverine, as although a change of pace and setting is always welcome, there's not much happening on screen for Logan to sink his claws into. The decision to move the action to the neon-lit Japan is an interesting one, but doesn't seem to serve any other purpose than to allow for some admittedly gorgeous-looking set-pieces, and to introduce a giant samurai robot for Logan to bash around. Lightly comic scenes of cultural differences are amusing, but seem out of place considering that Logan is repeatedly told he is a ronin, a samurai without a master.<br/><br/>With Logan seemingly invincible, The Wolverine does the thing that most superhero movies do nowadays which is to strip him of his powers. With Batman battered and imprisoned in The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Tony Stark without his army of metallic suits in Iron Man 3 (2013), here Wolverine's healing abilities are drained by villain The Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), who infects his body with a parasite. This is successful in making a more reluctant, damaged hero, and therefore adding dimensions to his character, but (as sexy as she is), Viper is a pretty thin and nonthreatening baddie, and resembles Uma Thurman's Posion Ivy from Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin (1997) too much to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>However, Jackman is as compelling as ever in the role, which is the sole reason that there is still life in Wolverine's stand-alone franchise. This is now his sixth film, in a role he has played for 13 years, and this is probably his most dynamic performance. The Wolverine is heavily flawed, but manages to be a minor success thanks to Jackman's ferocity and more concentration on the hero everyone came to see. There's also a nice little tie-in at the end to the upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past, adding yet another weave into Marvel's ever-expanding universe. But, with a weak climax and a strangely thin storyline, I would be surprised if The Wolverine lingers for very long in many people's minds.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","The X-Men series has had more than its fair share of ups and downs, with quality ranging from near-embarassing to a shining example of the genre. With Hugh Jackman's Wolverine being the most well-known character from the franchise, this is the second film focusing exclusively on him. The first of these, Origins, gave little to no insight into Wolverine's character, instead opting to stand back and observe the man going through the motions that many superhero origin stories require. The Wolverine, directed by 3:10 to Yuma's James Mangold, is in many ways at the opposite end of the spectrum. Taking place after the events of 2006's The Last Stand, Logan is haunted by the memory of Jean Grey, the love he was forced to kill at the end of that film. The fact that Wolverine does not age is fairly common knowledge, and here it is explored more as a curse than a blessing. This is all well and good, but The Wolverine takes something of a nosedive in the last half-hour, which sees the plot almost spiral out of control with a final revelation that left a bitter taste. The rest of the film, however, remains a satisfyingly introspective take on one of cinema's most well-known superheroes."

Wolvie running through the streets of Tokyo being chased by Yakuza was great. Some of the ninja stuff was cool as were a few of the new characters especially Yuriko. I just thought the whole Silver Samurai ness at the end ruined it. Anyone who reads the comics knows what I mean. The movie made him out to be some giant clunky robot... definitely not cool.

"Magow-Intermean","Null","0","0","27 March 2019"," The Wolverine Review
","Haunted by the death of Jean Grey, former X-man Logan (Jackman) is now a loner, foraging in the woods. But he's tracked down and brought to Japan by a billionaire who's keen to repay a life debt by stripping The Wolverine of his immortality. But it isn't going to be that easy...
In a summer packed with movies that work their way up to levelling entire cities, The Wolverine takes an interesting tack: that's how it starts. Within the first three minutes, Nagasaki has been obliterated in a mushroom cloud, courtesy of a B-29 bomber and the nuclear bomb known as Fat Man that effectively signalled the end of World War II.
In the middle of the mayhem, we find Hugh Jackman's Logan - aka The Wolverine - chained up and shirtless (of course; those playing the 'Shirtless Jackman' drinking game will be blootered by the second act) in the middle of a POW camp. As sirens blare and Japanese officers commit hara-kiri with honour, Logan is saved by, and then saves, an officer with a stricken conscience.
It's an audacious opening that some might find in dubious taste, but there are enough grace notes here - the opening shot of the B-29 approaching its target is serenely beautiful - to suggest this will be light years ahead of the lamentable X-Men Origins: Wolverine. And so it proves, even if it never hits the heights of the first two X-Men movies or X-Men: First Class.
After that grand opening, things scale back as we meet the Canadian mutant living rough on his home turf as, effectively, Grizzly X-Man, Les Mis hair and beard in place, plagued by visions of his lost love, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen, lounging in a négligée through interminable dream sequences) and as haunted by the events of X-Men: The Last Stand as anyone who saw it. He's a wounded bear who even encounters an actual wounded bear, just to pound home the metaphor. Logan has vowed never to hurt anyone again, a vow he breaks within roughly 37 seconds, but before he can kill some idiots in a bar, he's tracked down by the slinky Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a flame-haired employee of the man he saved in World War II, and brought to Japan, where he becomes embroiled in a convoluted plot involving the yakuza, indestructible samurai and a new lady-love in the beautiful Mariko (Tao Okamoto) who, in a nice twist, sees Logan and his claws as something to love, not fear.
And it's in its Japanese roots that The Wolverine becomes most intriguing. Comic book fans will know that Wolverine and the Land of the Rising Sun go together like Nic Cage and Pachinko, and it's refreshing that, Canada section aside, it takes place entirely in Japan. That alone is enough to make it look and feel unlike any other superhero movie to date, director James Mangold capturing a real sense of place as he frames Logan against Tokyo streets or in rural ryokans.
Sadly, the embrace of Japanese culture feels often skin-deep, a superficial whisk through a checklist of clichés. There's an (admittedly very funny) awkward visit to a love hotel with Mariko as they go on the run; Logan struggles to come to grips with chopsticks like a gaijin fool; and he keeps being told he's a ronin, a samurai without a master. Yet there's no sense his experiences have much of an impact - by the end he's as authentically Japanese as YO! Sushi. Just a shame he doesn't show up at a karaoke bar - we reckon Logan has serious pipes.
One of the - many - criticisms of Wolverine's last solo outing was that it never had the courage to trust in the appeal of its lead character, instead chucking in large numbers of rubbish mutants. The lesson has been learned here, with minimal muties (Svetlana Khodchenkova shows up as the venomous Viper, regrettably too reminiscent of Batman & Robin's Poison Ivy). Instead, Logan bloodlessly slices his way through armies of yakuza and ninjas, in keeping with the film's determinedly (open air quotes) realistic (close air quotes) tone.
It's all the better for it, from a free-for-all that puts the fun in funeral to the movie's highpoint, a creative showdown on top of a speeding Shinkansen. And, if you have any qualms about pitting a highly trained, invulnerable mutant against scores of rent-a-piñata henchmen, Mangold and Jackman level the playing field slightly by going full Superman II and depriving Logan of his powers. With his healing factor and animalistic senses on hold, Logan develops an aversion to shotgun blasts that slows him down considerably, and gives Jackman something interesting to play with sixth time around. That element is far more absorbing than his endless moping after Jean - some psychos don't need analysis.
It's regrettable, then, that in a film concerned with immortality, nothing lasts forever. The final showdown, tonally and in terms of scale, is deeply unsatisfying, with ludicrous reveals, bad CG and plot turns so convoluted they threaten to derail the movie at 300 mph.
An improvement on the last outing for Jackman's not-so-merry mutant. If only it trusted enough in its unique setting to forgo a descent into aggressively awful formula."

","The Wolverine <br/><br/>2013's The Wolverine is a much improvement over the characters first solo outing.
Having James Mangold onboard to direct was a very good idea indeed.
However it is obvious when he took the juicy bait to helm such a project those bean counters at 20th Century Fox reeled him back in.
So rather than making the movie Mangold and Jackman probably wanted to make, what we got was yet another PG13 child friendly movie.
As we see here you can't make a movie about a violent character without showing any violence.
Fox only rectified their continuing mistake with Mangold's second stab the superb 2017's Logan.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman returns once again, strapping on the claws to play Logan in an adventure that takes him to Japan.
Here he loses his healing ability and when he is forced to protect the granddaughter of an old acquaintance things aren't as easy as they usually are for our indestructible hero.<br/><br/>The Wolverine has flashes of brilliance but it also has some flashes of utter stupidness mixed in.
A rather entertaining movie that is spoiled by the ridiculous third act.
There's also some obvious questions that are raised that make the plot of the movie just down right silly.
Like if Wolvie has lost his ability to heal quickly why are there no wounds around his knuckles.
Surely the amount of time he keeps using his Adamantium claws he would just bleed to death.
How can he even function anymore when his now mortal body is laced with a poisonous metal. (In Logan, the Adamantium is deemed the cause of his deterioration.)
Another question that needs asking. Does Logan wear bomb proof pants?
Well he does take the full force of an atomic bomb and his flesh heals from the blast. However his undercrackers are completely unscathed?
The Wolverine is littered with such niggles.
I'm a huge fan of the X-Men movies and I consider Logan to be one of if not best superhero movie of all time.
This movie, The Wolverine seems to be a warm up, a practice run for James Mangold. Either that or he and Jackman demanded they make their own movie with Logan and not have those bean counters interfering.
If you're going to watch this film seek out the unleashed and extended cut.
It goes some way to improve the movie but it is still marred with the computer game Boss ending and there's no blood and gore. It's still watered down Wolvie but it has some nicely extended action sequences. 
The fight with the ninjas springing to mind.
In terms of image quality, The Wolverine looks stunning on Blu-ray and 3D.
Sound is also very good. You can hear the Snikt! of those claws in glorious HD sound.
Special effects are mostly good apart from the ending with the stupid Silver samurai scene.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is a above average outing for the worlds most popular X-Man , not enough to give the fans what they need.<br/><br/>Good job there's Logan for that then"

","I rented this movie from my local library and while I was a little skeptical (considering X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which I hadn't seen but I heard was bad), it didn't disappoint. We get more Wolverine action while he travels through Japan, plus lots of Yakuza fighting and beautiful scenery in the land of the rising sun. We even got the Silver Samurai. The nearly all-Japanese cast didn't hurt either. And considering I'm interested in Japanese culture, especially their pop culture, this really delivered. It sure outdid X3 and gave Wolverine his own movie in an exotic land. I don't remember a lot but I did enjoy this. It's probably good for a single viewing. Maybe two if you're big on Wolverine. But I was satisfied."

","Though the final confrontation does get a little silly (no doubt caused by studio interference), this small-scale story features some of the best action in the series, by using less wire-work and keeping it mostly practical, as well as a more realistic tone. Jackman also turns in what was perhaps his best work as the character up until this point. The story is appropriately tragic and was, at the time of its release, arguably the closest the character came to being 'comic accurate' on the big-screen, sans yellow suit (aside from its deleted scene, of course.) You can really see what they were going for here and when it works, it really works. The 'Unleashed Extended Edition' on Blu-Ray adds a lot to the experience, with additional blood and violence bringing the violence closer to the original intent. It does feel like a lite version of 'Logan (2017)', but in no way reaches the quality of that, while still being tethered to the studio's idea of what a commercially viable 'X-men' film 'should' be. It's an entertaining and interesting film, all the way until it's rather clunky and disappointing finale, but it still remains leagues better than the eponymous hero's first solo outing and is, I think, a little underrated. 8/10"

"swilliky","7","0","0","4 March 2017"," A great standalone Wolverine story
","The Wolverine picks up on the story of Logan (Hugh Jackman) after X-Men: The Last Stand and is an improvement on the standalone Wolverine film from his origin story. The movie captures historical context by an introductory flashback to the bombing of Nagasaki where Wolverine is held as a prisoner of war and helps to save the life of a young Japanese soldier from the atomic bomb. The film flashes to Logan having a nightmare about Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who he had killed in the previous film. He has taken to wandering aimlessly in the Canadian wilderness after the tragedy on Alcatraz until a poisoned bear brings him back to civilization. <br/><br/>Before Logan can exact revenge on the bear killing hunters, he is stopped by the fortune-teller Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who proposes that he fly with her back to Japan to see the young soldier, now an old mogul Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi). He quickly becomes embroiled in the backstabbing corporate dealing of Yashida's business and is forced to thwart the assassination and kidnapping attempts on Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto).<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"ThomasDrufke","7","0","0","3 March 2017"," Mortality
","Re-watching all of Hugh Jackman's performances as Wolverine has reminded me of a few things. The most notable being that no matter the quality of the film he's in, Jackman has always given it his all. He's put his body through vigorous training and eating routines so that the fans of the franchise have the Wolverine they've always wanted.<br/><br/>The Wolverine isn't a perfect solo outing for the clawed mutant. But it's 100% better than X-Men Origins Wolverine from quite a few years back. This adventure takes Logan/Wolverine to Japan to say goodbye to a dying old friend, Yashida, he saved from the atomic bomb in Nagasaki during World War II. Only, that friend has a little bit more planned than initially lead on. Yashida would like to transfer Logan's healing ability to his own body in order to stay alive and in turn, give Logan the ""mortality he's always wanted"". <br/><br/>This idea of mortality as it relates to Logan is a fascinating one, but it's not explored enough to justify an entire plot built around it. Even with his hallucinations of lying in bed with the deceased Jean Grey or walking around like a caveman don't necessarily sell me on his death wish. It feels more like the idea of mortality is forced into his subconscious rather than brought on naturally. Hopefully, 'Logan' tackles this theme in a more interesting way.<br/><br/>The other problem with this story is that it ventures deep into a family drama with the centerpiece being Yashida's apparent death. With the exception of a few scenes, it has the tendency to not feel like Logan's story at all. Instead, it's more like a modern-day western where Logan is forced to protect strangers for the greater good, ala Clint Eastwood in 'Pale Rider'. The Wolverine is like Iron Man 3 in that, the movie is fine by itself but it doesn't succeed entirely in being a comic-book adaptation. I understand that this was inspired by a specific run of comics, but the final product sure didn't feel all that worthy.<br/><br/>But there are plenty of positives. Jackman's performance goes without saying. It's impeccable. The action, and particularly hand to hand claw/sword battles are tremendous. Dare I say some of the best action the X-Men franchise has seen to date. The sequence on the bullet train is exceptional. But overall, the action and performances only even out the glaring weaknesses. The ending is a letdown and the inclusion of Viper feels completely out of place. Hopefully 'Logan' gives the titular character a bit more of his own story.<br/><br/>+Action<br/><br/>+Jackman gets bigger and better every time<br/><br/>-Viper<br/><br/>-Not really Logan's story<br/><br/>-Ending<br/><br/>7.1/10"
"ryanskywalker-87402","8","0","0","2 March 2017"," ""What kind of monster are you?""
","Boosting with bloody violence and pure rage; The Wolverine is quite possibly the most surprising entry in the X-Men franchise. When first released, I thought that it was good but it didn't blow me away. Watching now - after X-Men Origins - I truly love it and it was what the prequel was supposed to be.<br/><br/>The thing that Gavin Hood lacked was passion and knowledge of the comics. With James Mangold however, its completely different. Mangold understood the character of Wolverine, and instead of disregarding The Last Stand, he used it to his advantage as a focal point for Logan and it worked so so well. I love just how much everyone wanted to right the wrongs of Origins and they did it with ease. They made it a singular story and one that doesn't need any backstory and exists on its own.<br/><br/>Written by Mark Bomback & Scott Frank, The Wolverine has one of the finest examples of grounded superhero films. Like Nolan's films, this seemed real. It wasn't totally over-the-top, there weren't high battles and a beam shot in the air, and I loved it so much for that. It actually surprised me this time around, and I applaud them for the way they made the character of Wolverine weak and truly human again. The way that they work Jean Grey in is done phenomenally well, and the closure that the ending gives us was flawless.<br/><br/>Wolverine was the best thing about the original X-Men trilogy and Mangold used that to his advantage, as he made this a fun and bloody spectacle. The action done in The Wolverine may be the best in the entire franchise. It's Wolverine kicking ass and taking life, and it all looks beautiful, to be honest. The action was shot tightly, edited perfectly, and the choreography is truly amazing.<br/><br/>James Mangold is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to directing a superhero flick, as The Wolverine took risks that paid off. His direction is one point here and it's nearly flawless. Japan looked absolutely stunning in its nightlife, and the beginning WWII scene was really beautiful. The cinematography combined with Mangold's direction makes it a wonder in screen - especially on blu ray. I was in awe - this time around - at how well Mangold handled the action with the emotions of the characters. Each one has their motive and its all done so well.<br/><br/>When it comes to performances, it's clear that Hugh Jackman plays his best Wolverine. He's badass, he kicks tons of ass, and overall he feels menacing. Adding in the Japan elements made it look so great as well. I also love how great of a character Logan is. Sure its the same person; but then again, they're not. Mangold handled that aspect so well. The only other great actor here is Tao Okamoto, who is sexy as she is cool. I love her arc here and I love how well she works with Jackman.<br/><br/>I truly loved this more than I thought I would. After a hiatus in the franchise of stinkers - save for 2011's X-Men: First Class - James Mangold's bloody and brutal samurai flick, The Wolverine, is one of the must under appreciated films in general, not just in the superhero genre. Its Hugh Jackman's best portrayal yet, the Japan setting is unique and beautiful, and the script was handled perfectly."
"generationofswine","9","0","0","20 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","The first Wolverine solo movie stank. They ruined Deadpool and then tried to craft a movie that revolved almost entirely around a montage.<br/><br/>You can't make a movie that is one long montage.<br/><br/>But they corrected that in The Wolverine. They turned off the montage and gave us an actual story to follow...so much better than a two-hours of cut scenes.<br/><br/>And, to boot they gave us a quintessentially Wolverine solo adventure. So much of his comics revolved around Japan and Mardipol that the comic book audience was longing for it.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins was a disappointment, it har4dly even felt like a Wolverine solo adventure.<br/><br/>The Wolverine, however, has everything that die-hard fans loved about the Wolverine stories right down to Mariko and the Silver Samurai, the Japanese Yakuza and Wolverine-Ninja face offs.<br/><br/>It's a fan movie for the people that like the comics, and for the people that like the character. It fills in chunks of his long Swiss cheese fairly fraudulent memory and sets the stage for him to be not just the most developed character in the X-Franchise, but the ONLY really developed character in the franchise. Or at least the most consistent character...which is hysterical given that it's Wolverine.<br/><br/>there is real story here, so of course there are going to be a ton of kids out there calling it ""boring."" But for those of us that like something more than just images on a screen, this is a great comic book film."
"tankace","7","0","0","16 June 2016"," Better than Origins ,but not the best in the X-men.
","Wolverine the movie is the second solo flick featuring the fan favorite mutant and for starters is better than Origins ,but this does not say much because Origins is in every top ten of the worst superhero movies in history. The interesting think is that is set in Japan and seeing Logan in this place where fighting and honor ,due to the code of the Samurai, Bushido, is one and the same ,is quite cool.As for the time line, is after the Last Stand and before Days of Futrue Past.<br/><br/>Here we see Logan having lost his willingness to continue existing ,after the events of the Last Stand. It is made clear that his ability to regenerate from any injury and slow aging are curse as he sees it. To give you an idea as the movie is set in 2013 ,then Logan must be around 130 years old at least!! So when a Japanese scientist says to him that he can take away his abilities, then he is going for it. <br/><br/>And here is the movie's major plot hole, his abilities, unlike the adamantium ,are not put in to him ,but are part of his genes ,so telling him that can take away his powers is like saying to a blonde that you can take away the gene that make his or her hair blonde, scientifically impossible. Nevertheless for the sake of the story it happens and a little time after the action starts and the fight scenes rock!!! Their are some of the most entertaining action scene I have seen. In the same time we watch as Wolverine regains his attitude that makes his character famous and you fill good for him. And now for the ending ,to tell the truth is a bit underwhelming and most of secondary character are not very interesting, but as the story went they were OK?!<br/><br/>In summary is Wolverine good ,yes ,great ,no ,better than Origins or the Last Stand ,totally man. So why in the Helmet of Magneto has a lower score than either?? Anyway you will have fun see it and as far as solo Wolverine movies go ,if the following in 2017 continue this way then it will be a nice send of for Hugh Jackman as this character. I think a lot of people will feel sad when this happens, me included."

","Rating a movie based on a comic book is always hard. I want to take points away when they change things and divert from the original comic, but in a sense these movies are a re-envisioning, so I strictly rate them without bias. The Wolverine, which is mostly set in Japan, holds its own on the action front, but I find the story line to be predictable, even for someone who is not a comic book fan. Hugh Jackman, who seems to have the role as Wolverine down to a science, does do the character justice, but I think a lot of movie goers are tired of seeing him. This is Jackman's fifth time playing Wolverine (excluding first class, which he was in for about 1 minute).<br/><br/>Aside from Wolverine there were only two other mutants in this movie, Yukio and Viper. Although Viper's powers were interesting, Yukio's mutant abilities fell short. Her fighting skill did indeed add action, but I think you either need to go all in or not at all when making a movie based on a comic book. To the film's credit, it does have a strong story which is conveyed to the viewer in a more focused manner, unlike Wolverine Origins.<br/><br/>I would have rated this movie higher, but I think that it fell apart towards the end. The ""twist"" and climax were not as exciting as I had hoped and certain aspects of its conclusion were disheartening. I give the writer's credit for trying something new, not including a slough of mutants, and using a more traditional story telling structure, but the strength of the movie fades as it progresses, and by the end I am not as attentive as one would want their viewer."

","I liked X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Yeh, sure it's despised by a lot of the X-Men movie fan community and the comic book purists, but I quite enjoyed it the first time I saw it and while recent viewings of it didn't leave the same impact, it's still a movie I wouldn't mind watching every couple of eons. Of course, it's only my perspective, so I have to be quite honest when expressing my thoughts on a motion picture or picture show. That being said, the semi-sequel to X-Men Origins, simply titled The Wolverine is, well, kind of mediocre in my eyes. I didn't really have all that high of expectations for this film and it wasn't atop my MUST SEE list of 2013. But, after seeing the film twice now, I think the film is okay, but not a personal favorite. <br/><br/>I was never a big fan of the storyline where Wolverine travels to Japan, fights Silver Samarai and all that jazz to begin with, so I didn't really know what they were doing with this one, not what to expect.There were good action scenes and great character development for our main player, once again played by Hugh Jackman, but part of me was constantly saying ""I've seen this stuff a million times"". A million and one wouldn't have hurt, but I really wanted to see something unique, something fresh and innovative, something that was never done in an X-Men movie before. Of course Wolverine gets his claws covered in blood for the first time on film and the whole plot about Yashida taking his healing powers was very interesting, but most of the time, it felt like Wolverine just going around, stabbing people with his claws and smooching with the ladies. <br/><br/>A million times. <br/><br/>Sure, it's cool to see Wolverine being haunted by the ghost of Jean Grey, who he had to skewer in The Last Stand and the main female character, Yukio is beautiful, but at some parts, I wanted to drift off to slumberville. Some parts, I wanted to walk away and make my own assumptions on how the movie would end. The movie just didn't seem all that appealing to me. Now remember, it's just my opinion and if you like this movie, that's perfectly fine. Everyone has a different taste. But I really wouldn't want to watch this one that often. It was bland at some parts, mediocre in others and my overall verdict of the film is.....<br/><br/>meh<br/><br/>I liked some of the effects and the whole Japan environment is nice to look at, but I really don't have that much to say about this one. I really couldn't give a fist full of adamantium claws. It's just okay.<br/><br/>Hopefully, X-Men: Days of Future Past will be a zillion times better."

","As the comic book cinematic universes continue to expand it is difficult to keep up. Whether a film is a sequel, prequel, reboot, parallel story or a hybrid of what has come before, is almost mind boggling.<br/><br/>As the most successful character of the X-Men series, it always made financial sense for the man with the steel claws as ""Logan"" or ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman), to keep coming back for more.<br/><br/>This time we are transported back to just before the atomic bomb is dropped in Nagasaki 1945. Japanese officer ""Yashida"" (Ken Yamamura) instead of committing ritual suicide (Sepukku) along with his colleagues, opens all of the American prisoners cell doors, giving them a doomed opportunity to escape.<br/><br/>Deciding he is worth saving, Logan persuades his captor to dive into a pit and then shields him from the conflagration, using his indestructible body.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the present day and we find a troubled Logan waking post nightmare in bed with ""Jean Grey"" (Famke Janssen), all is not what it seems and suddenly we find the bedraggled Logan in the Yukon. With echoes of ""Jean Valjean"" from ""Les Miz"" still haunting Jackman in this mode of dress, you will be pleased to hear singing is not on the menu.<br/><br/>Logan is an angry man and soon finds an opportunity for a bar room fight, when local hunters treat their prey with no respect. Before he can do his thing, he meets ""Yukio"" (Rila Fukushima) a young red headed Japanese woman brandishing a Samuari sword known as the ""Seperator"" for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>Before you can say, neatly choreographed fight scene in local ale house, we are whisked off to Japan. The man he saved many years ago, ""Yashida"" wants to say goodbye. Of course there is an ulterior motive involving robbing Wolverine of his regenerative powers to save the older man thus allowing Logan to finally become mortal.<br/><br/>The plot thickens when the beautiful daughter ""Mariko"" (Tao Okamoto) appears on the scene and clearly needs Logans help, all is not well in the state of Denmark, or in this case, Tokyo.<br/><br/>The film attempts to broaden and deepen the role but does overall feel like a nod to current movie demographics, setting itself in Asia. The story as it unfolds, is unnecessarily complicated and towards the conclusion, teeters dangerously towards ""Transformers"" type territory with unintentional comedic moments.<br/><br/>The CGI especially towards the denouement is a bit ropey and what with Yakuza, lots of disposable henchmen dressed in black and sets that look, just like sets, the strive for realism takes a hit.<br/><br/>Jackman is as solid as ever, muscles popping and rippling like Mr Universe with Swiss army knives for hands. The supporting cast are just that, supporting and add little to the story or characterisations. At least this time we get Wolverine centre stage throughout the film with only minimal extra mutants popping up.<br/><br/>The prologue is perhaps the most interesting segment of the film but like X-Men before, some might question the use of this thematic element as a backdrop in a mainstream comic book film.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Not a bad film but not a great one either. Wolverine is still searching for that one good solo film he surely deserves.<br/><br/>Solid entertainment but overall aiming high yet falling somewhat short of director James Mangold's Japanese based vision for Wolverine."
"HelenMary","6","0","0","16 February 2014"," A good sequel to the Wolverine/X-Men franchise
","I'm not a Marvel super-fan so am not as clued up as some, but do enjoy the stories... especially Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). For obvious reasons. This appealed to me because of the Japanese/Samurai/Ronin connection, that I find interesting. The storyline was more convoluted, to my way of thinking, than the other Wolverine film, and even some of the X-Men. The film is shown through a series of fantasy/dream shots and also flashbacks as well as up to date action interspersed and shows Wolverine to be vulnerable and a deeper character.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's performance was superb; physical, emotional and powerful, and I have come to really appreciate Hiroyuki Sanada (47 Ronin, The Railway Man), a superb actor who has just ""popped up"" in Western films recently. The other actors were a little laboured in their performances but I liked Tao Okamoto (Mariko) and Rila Fukushima (Yukio) despite this, and there was much in their performances that was impressive most spectacularly some of the fight scenes. The Samurai sword - Katana - was shown to good effect in the film in some amazing sword fights often katana vs adamantium blades. The two girls, especially Yukio were very good. There was some humour, but it was mainly drama and action, fairly predictable and I felt the film went on a bit too long. The SFX were mainly very good, but there were a few bits that were a bit less slick and a little silliness - a few goofs. It was however, an enjoyable hour or so and I wouldn't be averse to seeing it again."

"seawolfvii","6","7","24","24 July 2013"," Wolverine roots...I suppose, but nothing spectacular.
","I am a fan, have been for decades, but not what you'd call a comic book geek (compliment intended). With that, I don't know where or how this movie coordinates or deviates from the comics. So my review is primarily movie-goer or cinematographic-based.<br/><br/>It was a good movie, solid cast. I really enjoyed the Japanese actors and what they brought to the movie. I think they gave the movie the bump up to 6.5 stars (from 5.5 where it would have been if it the rest of the movie were like the beginning) I hope to see more action movies from Ms. Fukushima and Ms. Okamoto could do well in many genera's. The Wolverine...can't die. And apparently neither can the Wolverine movies. Mr. Jackman does a great job as Wolverine but not his best (I mean it objectively, I'm sure he did his best). I feel the writers have relegated themselves to simplistic one-liners which maybe is supposed lend credibility to the ""wildness"" or simplicity of the character but I think with a little better writing we could get a better storyline and more exciting climactic lines. Giving us a real Wolverine punch when he finishes a foe.<br/><br/>Also I think if they wanted to add a more authentic Japanese flavor they should have hired Japanese cultural consultants. And maybe even just as an adviser, Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were good, very good...a little blurry but I guess that's how the cinematographers, choreographers, producers, editors, etc...create the intensity by allowing the human mind to fill-in the gaps.<br/><br/>The music was good, a few times it was powerful (appropriate, timely, etc...) but other times it was weak. A little more Japanese flavor I think would have lent credibility to the setting flavor. Try a Japanese flute (the Shakuhachi).<br/><br/>Basically to sum it up: If you want to produce a good Wolverine roots movie, write it as Wolverine not as Wolverine the X-man. Too many ties. I'll probably always go see a Wolverine movie in the theater (and thus support them) but this one was not great (I liked X-Men Origins: Wolverine better). And I'll probably still add it to my movie collection but I'll wait a while and get it at a discount.<br/><br/>Parts I had a problem with ******* Spoiler Alert ******* The bear...come on don't skimp with the intro of the bear, get a real bear! The part where the bear is dying...okay fine ""design a dying bear"" but where the bear is walking they should have used a real bear. I know Bart the bear is dead but he has successors (Little Bart who did a great job in Game of Thrones) is doing well in the movies. And the bear peeing on the tree...why? Lame. And you didn't need to ""introduce"" poison with that whole scene (Bear, dead bear, bar brawl, poison) to let the audience know there was such thing as poison arrows (weapons). Cause if they were trying to tie it in with Viper...that was so tenuous you could have put me in the movie with a churro and I would have made as much sense as a lead-in.<br/><br/>And again I loved Rila as Yukio in this movie (especially her fight scene with Shingen) but she slices a bottle...and it doesn't ""fall"" in half until seconds later? Booo...hiss. The chair fine, the bottle should have been shown first and then the chair.<br/><br/>Ninjas...I know they are ""NINJAS"" (emphasis intended) but when they are killing people, and there were two times I counted at the Yashida estate...they did it right in front of guards who were apparently sleeping while standing.<br/><br/>This is where I show my lack of comic geekness but how does he (Wolverine) get adamantium back on his bone claws? Did he ever get his adamantium coated claws cut off like that in the comics? <br/><br/>The parting line with the silver samurai was weak. I loved the big ole Silver Samurai (Samurai are just cool). But the parting line...weak. Try this, ""You had your life and the only good of you that will live on is your granddaughter. You wanted me to come to say good-bye...well sayonara bub (Toss him off the edge)."" Or something like that, just the ""You wanted me to say goodbye...sayonara"" was not a punch or even a slap. <br/><br/>And instead of kissing Mariko at the end (which is somewhat disrespectful in public in Japanese culture)...perhaps he could have kissed each of them on the cheek and said, ""My two favorite Japanese women."" or something."
"guycorhuo","5","15","67","24 July 2013"," Do Hara-Kiri (or better, Mangold could have done)
","First of all, my two favourites superheroes ever are Spiderman and Wolverine. Hence it's sad to me see that sometimes they do weak movies with these characters. I agree that the Tim Story's The fantastic four, Daredevil, Elektra, Spiderman 3, Ang Lee's Hulk and first Wolverine weren't too good, a bit silly but at least they were funny and entertaining. The major problem with this The Wolverine is that it's boring as hell, primarily the 40 minutes in the center of the story; the final twist is very predictable; the plot it's too easy; and they could have make the most of the Viper character. I liked 3:10 to Yuma, Copland and Walk the line and found amusing Night and Day, but James Mangold isn't an appropriate director for a Marvel movie. The best part is the extra scene few after the ending credits begin(I don't spoil it, don't worry) Values added are the beauty of Tao Okamoto that I think it's accurate to the Chris Claremont/John Byrne depiction of Mariko in the comic-books and Rila Fukusima performs a correct sidekick as Yukio. I bet that (sadly) there's not going to be a third Wolverine movie because this one is going to bomb at the box office. Specially after the first week word of mouth. My recommendation: as I would like to see a third one (hoping to see finally a good Wolverine movie), go to watch it, but if I have to be honest, save your money and wait to see it at home (cause is going to be cheaper the waste)."

","I thought I would wait for The Wolverine to come out on DVD before I watched it. But, I went to the theater with my friends and this was the best option. I wish I had waited. The movie is not a superhero movie that's very representative of the brilliant big screen flicks such as The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers. In short, it could have been better. A couple of things got to me. One being the lack of subtitles during the Japanese dialogues. There was plenty of it and the viewer only understood what was said once Logan asked a bilingual what the words meant. In my mind, subtitles were necessary. Although, to be fair, if the translation was not there, the viewer would be forced to assume that Logan knows Japanese. And that's just hogwash. Additionally, if Wolverine's body heals a lot faster than other mortals, doesn't logic dictate he would not need to sleep? Not sleeping would cause his body to break down, but it would heal anyway. On the upside, there was plenty of comedy to accompany the bad assness of Logan. I would not say this was a badly made film by a long shot; just sub par to what seems to be the expectation from superhero movies. Watched 08/20/2013, written 09/05/2013."

","Hugh Jackman returns for the sixth time as everyone's favorite bad boy mutant, Wolverine, in what is the best Wolverine-centric movie since 2003's X-2: X-Men United.<br/><br/>In The Wolverine, our titular hero journeys to Japan to say goodbye to Yashida, a man he saved from the H bomb in Nagasaki, who is now a dying business tycoon. Yashida offers the immortal Wolverine a tempting proposition -- he will thank Wolverine for saving him by taking away Wolverine's powers, enabling Wolverine to go off and be mortal. Of course, nothing goes as planned and everyone around Wolverine, including Yashida himself, seem to have ulterior motives.<br/><br/>What is so fun about this movie is that it's a serious, character centric superhero movie. This movie literally has only two other mutants in it other than Wolverine himself. It's quite simply a stripped down action movie where the hero just happens to have special powers and centuries of baggage that he must overcome in order to once more find his place in the world. Of course, by the movie starring Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, even though it's a dramatic look at what makes Wolverine who he is, Jackman still infuses the character with enough gruff charisma to where his one-liners are all actually funny and you're having fun while also being completely captivated by the serious tone of the story.<br/><br/>This is honestly unlike any other superhero film ever done before. There aren't many pure black-and-white characters in this story, almost every character languishes in the moral grey area, including Wolverine himself at times. It's a movie that actually shows one of the toughest superheroes in all his glory. While it's a shame that the climax of the film lacks any real definitive punch that tops all of the action and adventure that comes before it, The Wolverine is still a close to perfect cinematic adaptation that will please almost any fanboy.<br/><br/>I give The Wolverine a 9 out of 10!"
"holleratyourbutler","9","3","8","28 July 2013"," 'Everyone You Love Will Die'
","..these are the words James mangold wrote on the back of the scripts for 'the wolverine'. Lofty, heavy subject matter indeed. Did he deliver on this? I Think so.<br/><br/>Before I review this I want to stress that before you go and watch the film, do not expect to see an x-men film, or an x-men origins: wolverine sequel. It has references to canon established no doubt but this is THE WOLVERINE, singular. Got it? right.<br/><br/>I was quite surprised while I was watching this film, as a big fan of Asian cinema and the neo noir stuff they've been doing in Korean cinema for a little while, I found this settle into its aesthetic quite quickly and stands up there (cinematographically, is that a word?) with some of the best. Fair enough, mangold is trying to ape what has come before but he does it with some reverence and the tone is consistent throughout. That is until the final act, which I won't spoil.<br/><br/>THE WOLVERINE is more a character drama, a fish out of water story but also one of healing and redemption. Logan (played by Hugh Jackman) really is the focus here and is far and away the best thing in this movie.<br/><br/>In one scene that takes place in a Yukon bar, it is no more evident that james mangold has delivered on the 'simmering berserker rage' aspect of the character. There is so much intensity and nuance in Jackman's performance that you actually feel the stakes, that when pushed, wolverine is not a nice guy to be around. This permeated through the entire film and made it a fairly serious piece although it has its share of laughs but just enough levity to remind you of the wolverine we all know and love.<br/><br/>The film seeks to answer the question of what makes an, for all intent and purposes 'immortal' want to keep going. Does that person want to keep on going? Is immortality a curse? While the exploration of this isn't as deep as you'd expect, it is handled admirable enough with Logan as the subject matter. The film also (for comic book fans) explores how wolverine is defined by the women in his life. We all know the beauty and the beast aspect to his sorry tale but what if beauty dies, must he continue to seek out more beauty to temper his soul?<br/><br/>This films shows enormous restraint, but is also ballsy. Don't go into it expecting just wall to wall mindless CGI action, explosion, witty one liners or cities being destroyed. It's a gritty, deeply explored character drama and what some people will call boring, I would call cultural ignorance.<br/><br/>While I agree Asian cinema and culture is not everyones cup of tea, you have to be able to appreciate or at least tolerate it to really understand the films finer points, the sober mood & aesthetic. A third of the film was entirely in Japanese, with a predominantly Japanese cast. In some parts they consciously did not subtitle the dialogue so that the audience were as lost in this culture as Logan was. Do the studio even want to make money from this as a summer tent-pole movie? FOX actually showed some balls taking on this flick and given their history, they can only be commended for taking this risk.<br/><br/>Though not as good as batman begins, that feeling you got after you finished watching it and felt they nailed the 'essence' of batman from the comics, well that's the feeling I got after watching 'The Wolverine'.<br/><br/>The only flaw in the film was its final act. It is jarring to say the least only because what came before was of such high quality. It is handled as well as it can be but you cant help but think the studio did not compromise completely and to appeal to the mainstream demanded a more formulaic and familiar end set piece.<br/><br/>Supporting characters particularly the predominantly Japanese cast (with the exception of will yun lee who is of Chinese descent) were all handled well. Will yun lee's character 'Harada' seemed like there was a lot more to him and it would have been nice if he took a more prominent role but I can see how that would have taken away from Logan's spotlight. Many props to hiroyuki sanada, his nuance and intensity was also on show here I only wish there was more of him because it was refreshing to see him as an antagonist for a change. I really liked the character yukio (another character from the comics) in this film, beyond her performance her outfit is of note as it was very well thought out to fit with the aesthetic of the film without seemign ridiculous, she was very much an anime like punk character which I think was intentional look given to her, taking her savvy streetwise backstory into consideration.<br/><br/>James Mangold was correct when he said this movie was a Japanese noir movie with summer tent-pole action. There was absolutely no lies told about this movie, the trailer was pretty damn honest. Well, except for the fact we have to wait for the DVD/blu ray to see extended action sequences that were alluded to in the trailers but not shown in the film (i'm looking at you ninja scene)!"

","I love the X-Men movies. The first three were endearing and fun movies with spectacular set- pieces, fun character interaction, and classic stories. I even liked Wolverine's Origin movie for what it was, though I understand why it let down so many fans. <br/><br/>But mostly, I love Logan the immortal Wolverine, the hopeless romantic, the loner, the leader, and the unstoppable hero.<br/><br/>I had such unwarranted, high expectations for this movie that I was bound to be let down, and I hold literally nothing against the rest of the series, but this one felt like a cop-out. <br/><br/>A safe little one-off campaign to whet our appetites, to reverse the damage from ""Origins"".<br/><br/>The characters are bland and boring. There are only maybe 5 main characters, being generous, and that's a Japanese family and Logan. I don't remember any mutant powers besides the archer.<br/><br/>Half the movie was zoom-in shots of each character's face, pointless and awkwardly paced- It didn't even feel like an X-Men movie. And a carnal sin of comic-book movies, it was frequently boring and slow!<br/><br/>Half of the movie is Logan having dreams of Jean Grey, again and again, very boring.<br/><br/>Wolverine takes down literally EVERY opponent in the movie in one swing of his claws. One! Every time! The whole, ""make you mortal"" plot line didn't go Anywhere!!! Nothing Effing Happened!<br/><br/>There were two decent fight scenes. The train scene, which honestly was kinda stupid, and the final battle which was a let-down in too many ways.<br/><br/>I haven't read this story, but it was a great idea and instead it feels like a one-off Japanese Wolverine movie. It's like Fox out-sourced the movie to some Japanese production company who just had no idea what to do with the material.<br/><br/>Dialogue blows, fighting is boring, characters are weak the only mutant powers on display are Logan's ""slower"" regeneration and a guy with perfect aim and a crossbow. And the scene where that girl cuts the barstool and the glass with the sword are the ONLY times sword-play is used effectively.<br/><br/>Days of Future Past, I'm counting on you"

","A fish-out-of-water, ninja, superhero mutant movie?! Yes!<br/><br/>Throw in a little Shakespearean family intrigue and a brooding tortured lead character (all via Akira Kurosawa) and you have one of the most interesting films of this woeful summer.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is a breath of superhero fresh air. A new setting, a change in tone, and a personal journey for the Hamlet of the mutant world gives the superhero genre a much needed shot in the arm. The Wolverine makes The Man of Whining Steel look so so dated.<br/><br/>Some very nice character work and subtlety, particularly in the first half of The Wolverine, is undermined by the 47 clunky needless dream sequences that ""tell"" rather than ""show."" Seriously, it's as if a third-grader was hired to polish the work of A-list screenwriters. The script changes were done in crayon, with doodles drawn in the margins.<br/><br/>Superhero fans will no doubt be disappointed with all the attention placed on character here, but these slow insightful moments are what make the film interesting. God knows we didn't need another high adrenaline summer film chock full of pointless action (Star Trek Into Dumbness, Pacific Dim-witted).<br/><br/>That's not suggesting that the body count is low. It's not. The Wolverine slices and dices his way through all of Japan with his ginsu-like claws. The set pieces, except for two, are not grand or spectacular though. Not something I really minded since the genre mashup and story kept things interesting – for me at least.<br/><br/>Once again: a fish-out-of-water, ninja, superhero mutant movie. If that's not a movie crying ""fresh"" I don't know what could be. Sharknado, perhaps?<br/><br/>Oh, then there is the ethereal, graceful beauty of female lead Tao Okamoto. You just have to see her in this. Photos from the web cannot do her justice. A model appearing in her first film, she is an absolute natural. The exact opposite of Cindy Crawford. Does anyone remember Fair Game? (Hot movie poster, bad movie.) The development of the relationship between Tao's character and The Wolverine in the first 60 minutes is incredibly well-handled and Tao shows such a strength, confidence, and vulnerability. It makes those interrupting 89 dream sequences seem that much more sinful and intrusive. (We get it already! The Wolverine is a tortured soul. Enough.)<br/><br/>All the loose ends are pulled together neatly in a third act that is pretty generic superhero fare. A letdown really.<br/><br/>The sum of its parts is greater than the whole, and given the pathetic summer at the cinema this has been, The Wolverine gets seven ninja stars out of 10.<br/><br/>-- There's a post-credit scene here, so stay to the end. I, unfortunately, did not get the memo until it was too late."
"jessicareid","7","3","8","28 July 2013"," Slightly disappointed
","This film is set following the events of The Last Stand and it shows Wolverine attempting to deal with the aftermath. In the beginning he is almost unrecognisable and he has distanced himself from his former life. However this is Wolverine and he could never stay away from trouble so it's not too long before the action starts kicking in.<br/><br/>Certain aspects of the story line felt rushed and though it wasn't hard to follow, it didn't seem like enough thought had been put in. In particular I found the love interest extremely forced and unnecessary especially because so much of the story evolved around it. However I still enjoyed this film and there were plenty of brilliant action scenes as should be expected when the main character is Wolverine. Despite the questionable story line this film is still definitely worth a watch, for Hugh Jackman's continued brilliant portrayal of Wolverine if nothing else."
"kkhannah","6","3","8","27 July 2013"," Numerous flaws spoil an otherwise entertaining movie.
","If you're looking for a good flick to wile away a few summer hours with, you could certainly do worse than The Wolverine. Hugh Jackman is back in shape (both physically and mentally) as the title character; at this point in the game, it's hard to imagine any other actor taking over the role. The rest of the cast perform mostly admirably in their roles, although there are definitely occasions where Svetlana Khodchenkova seems like she was transplanted from a James Bond flick or a campy animated series. It's also nice to see a superhero film that spends more time examining its main character rather than subjecting them to repetitive action scene after action scene (looking at you, Man of Steel). However, the film suffers from a number of flaws that prevent it from being the ultimate superhero flick. <br/><br/>For one, although the film pays great attention to Logan, the other characters suffer in their development. Even when motivations are explained, they seem rather shallow or downright unbelievable, even considering the superhero genre. The characters also have little chemistry with each other; although I'm aware that it's present in the original comic book arc, the romantic subplot between Logan and Mariko simply bogs the movie down. It particularly seems distracting given that Jean Grey is such a huge presence in Logan's life still, as illustrated through his visions and flashbacks. Overall, despite the obvious efforts of Jackman and Okamota, the romance feels incredibly forced. <br/><br/>In the end, The Wolverine certainly isn't a horrible movie. Viewers who are used to more fast paced superhero movies may have a hard time enjoying the slower paced film but it's still a good popcorn flick. However, it suffers from some major flaws that prevent it from being a truly memorable film, rather than a merely decent one."
"UMWolvie2442","Null","3","8","27 July 2013"," Met and then exceeded all expectations! Great film.
","The Wolverine is exceptional in every way. It's an awesome action flick that totally surpasses its predecessors. It ultimately stays true to its comic-book roots while finding a unique and believable pivot point for an outstanding film all on its own. Take out all the action and you'd still have an entertaining character drama. That says a ton.<br/><br/>It's not just that this movie is more character driven yet still delivers thrilling action sequences, though that's true. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. The Wolverine starts with the perfect pace and springboards in to aspects of the classic Miller/Claremont Marvel Comics mini-series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with films in this genre. Too much of 2013 has given us good reason to equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. But the writers here are as interested in the subtext as they are in the high quality action. There's no denying that mutant powers are a tool but it's the character depth that really drives this film. They use state-of-the-art special effects to deliver a live-action version of the comic books. What fans already know, however, is that vintage Marvel books are classics because of intelligent writing as much as comic book flare and fantasy. The movie delivers tremendous story and skillfully weaves together character, plot and action. It's just plain spectacular on any level that you judge it."

","Its the season of superheros and comic book characters for Hollywood, the latest offering 'The Wolverine'. The movie is based on everyone's favorite mutant antihero — tortured, boozy X-Man Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine.Though the film connects and refers to various past ""X-Men"" films, this one is no sequel. It has a consolidated story by itself and the past references beautifully merge with the present tale on its own.<br/><br/>Read complete review at http://theblahqueen.com/?p=1851 Story<br/><br/>The movie opens with Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) saving a young Japanese soldier Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) survive the atomic blast (Yes,Logan is capable of surviving a nuclear blast. If you have a problem with the physics of that, you might as well stop reading now) at Nagasaki. Then we flash-forward to the present day, with Logan living in the Yukon in hibernation to escape his memories of having killed his true love, Jean Grey (Refer : X-Men:The Last Stand).It is only when Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a fiery warrior with equally fiery red hair, finds Logan and tells him that Yashida is dying and wishes to say goodbye that Logan returns to society and heads to Japan. However he soon realizes that Yashida wants to say more than a goodbye in short take advantage of Logan's healing powers. Being denied that, Yashida dies but not before he makes Logan promise that he would protect his granddaughter Mariko(Tao Okamoto) who he fears would be murdered soon after she inherits his empire. What follows is crazy politics withing the Yashida clan along with a high dose of action.There's sword fighting, knife throwing, and some ninjas with bows and arrows. In the middle of it all, of course, the claws come out.There is a female villain - Viper(Svetlana Khodchenkova).<br/><br/>Performances<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as Logan expertly fits into the character. He shows the inner struggle and emotional conflict with great ease and creates a connect with the audience.Tao Okamota as the dynamic Mariko is beautiful and elegant, but the chemistry between Logan and her is superficial . Rila Fukushima is decent as Yukio. Unfortunately the worst part of the film is Svetlana Khodchenkova's role as Viper. The character sketch for the same is very weak.She brings too much melodrama in the movie.Her costumes sadly laughable and her main motive seems to be villainy for villainy's sake. The editing by Francois Audouy is crisp and director of photography Ross Emery too is worth a mention.And, true to Marvel fashion, there's an excellent post-credits scene.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>The Wolverine is an entertaining movie you can definitely catch it this weekend but you may not like this film if you aren't fond of superhero flicks based on comic book characters.<br/><br/>Read compel"
"jjgooner","6","3","9","26 July 2013"," Ruined by a dire third act
","The Wolverine<br/><br/>**1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>126 mins/ 12<br/><br/>Cast: Hugh Jackman, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, Svetiana Khodchenkova, Brian Tee, Hal Yamanouchi, Will Yun Lee, Ken Yamamura, Famke Janssen, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart<br/><br/>Director: James Mangold<br/><br/>Plot: Wolverine is forced to examine life as an immortal when he is offered the chance to become a normal and mortal human being. <br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: The first two thirds of The Wolverine are terrific. It has great entertaining and well- paced action sequences with some actual meaning, but isn't afraid to slow down to develop the characters and storyline. Hugh Jackman gives a strong and more mature portrayal of Logan/Wolverine and the supporting cast shows off some of the best upcoming Asian actors and actresses. It takes a bold leap and tries not to be your typical summer blockbuster. It is a real shame then, that the final half-an hour or so, has meaningless action, silly twists and turns and really just dissolves into generic blockbuster madness. <br/><br/>Taking place after the events of the original X-Men trilogy, The Wolverine follows Logan living life alone, still haunted by the death of his lover Jean Grey. But when he is summoned to Japan to say goodbye to a dying old friend, he gets much more than he bargained for. The friend offers to end Logan's immortality by swapping it with his mortality. From here, although Logan rejects the offer, he begins to struggle with the thought of living forever and watching everyone he knows age and die while he continues to live as a youthful immortal. While with his old friend, he gets mixed up in his family threats and arguments as wills and legacies are discussed. And after they remove Logan's healing powers without his consent, he goes on a quest to win it back and save the woman he has fallen in love with.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is definitely the most mature of the X-Men films. Although they have all had a dark and sometimes bleak tone, they were never depressing. But here, Logan's obsession with Jean Grey and his struggle with no healing and immortality are a massive part of this film. I, for one, praise the film for embracing these elements of Logan's troubled life. Despite marketing the film for children, adults will probably enjoy it more. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman puts in his most emotional portrayal of Logan yet and ups his character's anger and roughness but still keep the mutant we loved in the X-Men trilogy. Not only does his character develop extremely well throughout the film, but even in the action sequences Jackman is acting instead of just fighting aimlessly. While on the subject of action sequences, the earlier ones are brilliant set-pieces all on a large scale and director James Mangold takes full advantage of the Japan setting to create some truly memorable fight scenes. One scene, which is probably my contender for action sequence of the year, is one on top of a train travelling at 300mph. The camera-work is brilliant as is the choreography and effects to create a very intense scene. The rest of the cast, which is mainly full of native Japanese actors and actresses, is very good. The two female leads, Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukishima, are excellent in what are actually film debuts for both of them. While X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine had too many random mutants, in this film there are only two others in the main storyline of the film. One, Rila Fukishima's fortuneteller Yukio, is brilliantly focused on and developed as she copes with her mutation. The other mutant is Svetlana Khodchenkova's Viper, who is unfortunately the film's weakest character. She comes across as freaky and weird and frankly, you do not wish to see her on screen. Her role in the film is predictable and compared to the other characters, there is nothing to her except being able to spit acid in people's faces.<br/><br/>After a mature and dark character study, you would hope they wouldn't ruin it with a lagging and meaningless massive action scene in which each hero is about to die but is then miraculously saved by a friend at the last moment and each villain looks certain to die but somehow they can get straight back up again. It seems the writers ran out of ideas fro the last half an hour so just decided to try and complicate things by having silly and unneeded twists and continuous unrealistic action for about ten minutes straight.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is a fantastic character study of scarred man dealing with so many problems in his life. It is just a shame it runs out of steam at the end and presents us with a very poor and film- ruining final act. Make sure to stay behind for a credits scene involving two original trilogy enemies who are credited above."

At the end,how could they manage to get out the house with many skilled ninja in there?"
"CrisMovieCorner","10","2","5","18 February 2014"," Un-fecking-believable! Mangold makes a masterpiece!!!!!!
","I have been a HUGE X-Men fan for as long as I can remember, even as a child I loved the animated series more than I should have ha. So when it was announced there would be another addition to the X-Men franchise I was made up especially when I heard it was another Wolverine instalment, they had to make up after Gavin Hoods not very well acclaimed ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". Wolverine has always been a favourite character of mine, for me he is equally the best comic character along with Batman.<br/><br/>At times you kind of forget this film is a comic adaptation, it kind of has a more noir thriller feel too it, the story is based on a 1980's story arc by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. The film opens with a prologue by the Wolverine himself while saving a Japanese soldier from the horrific atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki before making a switch to Americas northern neighbourhood Canada. Where Logan is shown torn to pieces following the death of his one true love Jean Grey events which occurred in ""X-Men: The Last Stand"". In the woods Logan comes across a bear that has been poisoned by a hunter, the hunter which Logan tracks down, this exert is taken in near perfection from the comic.<br/><br/>After this is really when the film kicks into full on storytelling mode, Logan meets Yukio, who is Harada's bad ass assassin, when she arrives in Canada to give him a sword from her master. ""The Wolverine"" strives on a great Crime/Thriller aspect which is kind of obviously going to be there when you see who wrote it Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") was involved, so this pedigree holds for a beautifully made film with great characters and a great script. After arriving in Japan, Mangold tries to keep true to Japanese rituals and traditions to me, he does that superbly. This just cements for me the fact that Mangold was a great choice to direct.<br/><br/>All this depth is shown at Harada's funeral when the proverbial poop hits the fan, when a bunch of Japanese criminals attack the home and attempt to kill his sole heir and granddaughter Mariko. In which can only be described as a old school Hong Kong-esque fight scene, car chase and even the inclusion of the famous Japanese bullet train. This is just one of the styles Mangold uses throughout the film which creates an unbelievable violence which shocked me they included in a 12A (UK certificate, PG-13 US I believe). Even with all this incredible action, Mangold took time away from the Kapows and Bams in order to delve deeply into the relationship between Logan and Mariko, which serves as a nice break from the action.<br/><br/>The third act of the film is really where they go back to the comic book aspects we have seen more in Singers instalments in the franchise. Logan comes up against a monster of a villain when he encounters Silver Samurai who is huge compared to comics, but I guess that it is a given due the fact we have a near 6 foot tall Wolverine opposed to the smaller man in the comic panels.<br/><br/>It was great to see Jackman getting to play the more human part of Logan we rarely get to see in previous X-Men films, and play it well he does! It is not only Jackman that plays his character well, Mangold gets the best out of his Japanese actors who a lot would say are playing outside their comfort zones by featuring in an English language film. Just another reason in why Mangold was a fine choice, this is the Wolverine/X-Men film we have been waiting for since 2001 when Singer released the first X-Men movie.<br/><br/>So overall, amazing action, incredible acting, done so much better than people would expect or give credit for within a comic based film. I can safely say I am a huge fan of this film I even have the film on Blu-Ray Steelbook and it is one of my prize possessions, I highly look forward to the next instalment with Mangold and Jackman!"

The Wolverine is a different story.<br/><br/>The film begins in Japan during the war that took place several decades ago. When the bombs begin to drop, Logan protects one of the Japanese soldiers from being killed and years later the man he saved reaches out to him to give him thanks before he croaks over but little does he know he is brought to Japan for another reason and has his powers stripped away and forces him to go on a journey to stop those responsible. <br/><br/>The movie is very talkative. I actually watched the extended version which is almost 2 hours and 20 minutes but during that span little action takes place and when it did it left me very disappointed. The action did not really start until 40 minutes into the film. There were a few funny moments but the writing was weak and the acting for the most part atrocious. The film did gross more then the first wolverine installment but films that deal with members of the Xmen or the Avengers will always for the most part be a box office success. The Wolverine is a 3/10 film in my opinion"

Man of Steel was certainly not a masterpiece but compared to this it was pure Shakespeare poetry. <br/><br/>Movie makers have ran out of new ideas for movies. The Dark Knight franchise aside, all superhero movies have become crap. Period. Hugh Jackman does make a good Wolverine and I love the guy, but this was his worst film.

","A standalone comic film adaptation is supposed to bring astonishing development to a superhero to establish a deeper understanding of its existence in its own universe. The long-time Marvel superhero Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) gives us a new breath of fresh air in this new film The Wolverine. Unlike the 2009 film ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", the new Wolverine film helmed by director James Mangold (3:10 To Yuma, Walk The Line) grabs the opportunity to deliver an even anarchistic Wolverine and a fitting to the X-Men universe.<br/><br/>The narrative is entirely focused on the Frank Miller and Chris Clairmont comic issues, which is set in Japan. Logan as the Wolverine, embarks on his way to Tokyo accompanied by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) to bid adieu to a Japanese WW II veteran back in 1945 during the Nagasaki Bombing, Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi). The dying Yashida, who presently owns a tech company, wants to pay Logan a price for saving him from the atomic bombing. Yashida wants him to be mortal by transferring his own healing factor, but Logan refuses. <br/><br/>The film takes off after Yashida's death and a sinister event involving one of the mutant physicians who turned out to be the Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who plants an anti-Adamantium substance-like to Logan reducing his healing ability. A group of Yakuzas captures Mariko (Tao Okamoto), the granddaughter of Yashida. Logan must see to it that Mariko is not in the wrong hands.<br/><br/>""The Wolverine"" is a slam-bang CGI-induced movie unlike the passable ""Man of Steel"" which is packed with bloated CGI wallop and less humor. With Japan as the setting, the Wolverine character's given an anarchic feel and out-of-this-world dire ramification of being out of his powers and learning of his own as an outsider. The action packs a punch, especially if we arrive at the bullet train scene at the speed of light. And of course, one of the rivalries of mutants, the ninjas gives helping in providing real clash for Wolverine. <br/><br/>The only thing I'm disappointed would be the overuse of CGI in some obvious fragments of the film. If you've seen the trailer, you know whom am I referring to. <br/><br/>Among the superhero films of 2013, ""The Wolverine"" is one of the best. At least the Wolverine this time knows how to make a difference and proves that he's one of the badass superheroes of this generation. ""The Wolverine"" is an edge-of-your-seat metal-clanging new offering which never fails."

","I hate to admit it, but I completely forgot that I saw The Wolverine. As an X-Men follower, I of all people should've written this review a few weeks ago. I had intended on it, but I have been mega busy. So, here I am, telling you now, not mega busy. The Wolverine isn't the best X-Men movie in the series, but it is one of the better ones.<br/><br/>The film follows Logan (Hugh Jackman, as great as ever), who has a huge opportunity thrown his way when he gets to Japan. What is it? A dying ex-soldier who Logan saved years ago offers Logan the chance to live a normal life; to drop the immortality and live life normally. Logan is soon in trouble when this Viper woman shows up, and soon everyone is out to get him.<br/><br/>I am one of the rare few who actually liked X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The script was clunky, but as a movie it is pretty entertaining. That said, I myself was slightly skeptical on The Wolverine. Not because of that movie, but because there isn't much of a cast. It is basically Jackman and Famke Janssen, who returns as Wolverine's dead love Jean. That is it. I needed more than that.<br/><br/>I was wrong though. The Wolverine works because this time the script is better. Also, they picked a director who actually made sense. The Wolverine is directed by James Mangold, an overlooked filmmaker who experiments with genres. He directed Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma, and Kate & Leopold. See what I mean? This guy knows how to direct a movie, and with this movie he has created a gorgeous universe. He handles these actors well, because he knows how to.<br/><br/>The star of the show is Jackman, obviously. Once Jackman is gone, so am I. In his sixth performance as Wolverine, it is clear that he hasn't lost his touch. This movie is just part of the reason why he is a star. He's great. Also, the visual effects work marvelously and the action sequences are cool. Also, there is a twist that you will never see coming.<br/><br/>Overall, I prefer the previous X-Men film, X-Men: First Class. But The Wolverine is a consistently entertaining film that leaves you jazzed up for the next (and what I predict will be the last) X-Men film, X-Men: Days of Future Past. If you were left dissatisfied with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, go for this one. It is better. It is a much more mature film with an interesting premise. See it.<br/><br/>B+"
"veensepeper","8","2","5","24 September 2013"," The Marvel Cinematic Universe should take notes from this
","I will not say that 'the Wolverine' is not without flaws. The attempts at humor are awfully out of character or out of tone for the rest of the movie. The scene in which Wolverine is forced to take a bath is cringingly bad. And there's debate on whether the 'return of the upright chopsticks' is a goof or not. The pitch-perfect F-bomb from 'X-men First Class' is recycled here, and on occasion Wolverine is not just a ruffian but a straight forward jerk.<br/><br/>And the entire third act is so out of place, it's almost like you're watching another movie.<br/><br/>However, having this said, 'the Wolverine' redeems a lot what went wrong in the X-men franchise. It was a bold move to take the super-hero movie out of the action-adventure cliché and use the concept for a character study with noir qualities. It was darker and more profound... like 'Iron Man 3' attempted to be and failed at. Comparing the two movies would be in place.<br/><br/>In both movies, it is explored what remains of the 'man' if the superpowers are taken away. Iron Man is not able to use his suit, Wolverine's healing factor is trimmed down. Wolverine knows the stakes are up and acts accordingly, Iron Man remains his old witty self and considers his loss of power merely as a temporary set-back.<br/><br/>Another point is comparison is the way both characters handle trauma. Wolverine is torn by guilt, for having to kill Jean Grey in 'X3'; Iron Man is traumatized from being an Avenger (though far worse things have happened to him). Wolverines guilt-complex is envisioned by visions of Jean, that evolves as the events in the movie progress, leading up to redemption. Iron Man has PTSD that is just there, ruining the pace of the movie, and going no-where.<br/><br/>Both movies go all-out ridiculous in the third act. But, apart from that, 'the Wolverine' does right what 'Iron Man 3' does wrong."

","Most are still waiting for that ""great"" x-men movie, and saw this as the chance to redeem a series that has disappointed so many. Who can blame them? ""The Wolverine"" is based on one of the more popular story lines from the comic books, so it really is an attempt to keep the real fans happy, in a way the last couple of movies have not. Which was already a good thing, before even having seen it.<br/><br/>Aye this flick will no doubt wet the appetites of Wolverine fans, as he arrives in a scenic Japan. The movie is not without its flaws, but being set in Japan makes for a nice change (Much like the 60's setting did for ""X-men – first class""). This Movie has learnt from its predicesors mistakes, and isn't crammed with to many ideas or other mutant's, and there's plenty of action and character stuff, as well as lots of Hugh Jackman topless, to cater to the women dragged along by their boyfriends.<br/><br/>Folk are still complaining however (and I'm about to join them). I'm not sure why others are winching, but I thought the final twist of ""Wolverines"" plot really ruined the whole darn thing. I love a twist when it makes sense. But this flicks final big reveal during the big finale is one of those questionable ones that pretty much ruins the whole plot of the movie. Even more than some of the terrible continuity errors that this series has now got under its belt."
"slicedbread117","7","2","5","27 August 2013"," This is the Wolverine we all love.
","Okay let's get it out of the way. X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a train wreck. It took one of Marvel's biggest and best heroes and turned his face value down a few notches. This is not the case with The Wolverine. This was the movie that the character deserved from day one.<br/><br/>Has any actor ever fit their respective superhero role better than Hugh Jackman as Wolverine? Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man maybe, but even more than him, Jackman has been solidified as the only actor that could ever play the mutant bad ass. This movie finally shows off Jackman in full, giving him nearly 100 percent of the screen time and letting Jackman let loose in arguably his best performance as Logan/Wolverine yet. I wish Hugh Jackman could stay young forever to play Wolverine for eternity, and this movie shows why he will forever be the greatest Wolverine. <br/><br/>The story is, to say the least, a major upgrade from Origins. Wolverine is shown as a man who's gone rouge and is requested to travel to Japan to visit an old friend. Eventually, Logan becomes engaged in a mission to protect Mariko Yashida, the grand daughter of Logan's old friend. Logan runs into some awesome action scenes where the total brute force of Wolverine is unleashed. The story also sees Logan battling with his inner demons, and the occasional cameo from his deceased love interest Jean Grey shows that Logan is contemplating death to reunite with his lost love. It is a different side of Wolverine that we haven't seen before and the movie benefits from it. The Viper ends up making an appearance as a side villain, and eventually the movie concludes with a satisfying final battle scene. The story of the movie was engaging and exciting, giving Wolverine the story he needed 4 years ago. <br/><br/>The Wolverine wouldn't be anything without action, and there is lots of it. Hugh Jackman's ageless body comes out swinging hard, right from the first time he pops his claws out and you get that awesome sensation that it's about to go down. The action scenes are fun and varied, the highlight being a battle on a super-speed train that sees Wolverine use his smarts, as well as revealing something different from the hero. Without going into to deep of spoilers, Logan is eventually faced with his healing ability being stripped from him, making for a much deeper character than just a bash and claw guy. However, this doesn't stop Logan from doing what he does best, kicking total ass. All in all, the action is splendid. Even a few major clichéd one liners are delivered that in probably any other movie would be criticized, but for Wolverine, they were awesome.<br/><br/>This is what I wanted from my Wolverine movie 4 years ago. A movie solely focused on the title character, that showed him mowing baddies down while providing me with an interesting story that kept me interested the whole time. Some of Wolverine's best stories have come from his adventures in Japan, and I'm glad that writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank, along with director James Mangold, used Japan as the setting for this movie.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is the Wolverine. No other actor could fit the role better, and for all of the films and the 13 years Jackman as put into the character, it's extremely rewarding to see him in the movie that everyone wants. The Wolverine is a total blast, and stick around for an after-credits scene that had me jumping out of my seat for joy as it sets the stage for the next X-Men movie.<br/><br/>8.5/10 (added my own 0.5)"
"popandcrackcorn","7","2","5","26 August 2013"," Back to the basics
","James Mangold's The Wolverine finally gets the Marvel movies back to dork fandom level 11, which is good since they aren't taking DC's path of realism (besides that terrible Green Lantern) and trying to remain more in tune to the comics themselves. And if you're going to appeal to the real comic fans, you have to bring in some real obscure story lines. I'm not saying that The Wolverine plot is as classic as bringing Carnage to Manhattan, but just by getting Logan to Japan has to pump up any fat slob who still has all his comics in those terrible plastic sleeves and no clue when the first NFL game is this year. Simply put, if you don't get jazzed up hearing the words Silver Samurai, then this film is not for you. <br/><br/>The basic story starts with Logan living in a cave and befriending bears, mostly from feeling guilty due to the loss of Jean Grey (stunning Famke Janseen), whom became The Phoenix in X-men 3 which was terrible, even though having the best storyline in comic book history since Batman kicked the hell out of the Predator twice (ed. note: that's up for debate). Soon the past catches up with Wolvie, as often does, and he's thrust in a mix of Japanese Yakuza and robotic monstrosities, all of which are after his magical healing power. There is so much more involved, but I've already caught hell from spoiling, so I really don't want to tell you that Logan dies and Cyclops is really Cable's father. <br/><br/>As a movie, it's pretty elevated on the comic level, particularly compared to the latest Marvel blasphemy Iron Man 3, which had the greatest villain Iron Man ever faced becoming little more than a hackney actor (ironically played by one the greatest actors Ben Kingsley). The Wolverine does some alteration to the main characters involved, but leaves opportunity for a correction in breaking with the canon. However these are all characters that need to be brought into Logan's life, since around 400 issues of Wolverine involve Logan turning Japanese Vapor-style.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, of course, does a fantastic job portraying our favorite Canucklehead. As much as I want to bash him due to everything he's done that doesn't involve claws, he really carries Logan's internal issues perfectly. Furthermore he looks like I imagine myself, if I didn't solely eat KFC double downs and consider urination to be exercise. As an added bonus there's a hint to Logan's claws actually being (spoiler), though I couldn't confirm that because some dork's cosplay was blocking my view for half the movie.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the plot, but it's easy to follow and a lot of fun. Some great characters pop up, including Logan's love Mariko (the beautiful Tao Okamoto), assassin Yukio (the perfectly last name Rila Fukushima), and the vicious Viper (difficultly named Svetlana Khodchenkova), the latter of which was mainly tied to the enemy organization Hydra than a Japanese organization, though I could be wrong as I bailed halfway through reading her Marvel profile. There are more characters involved in the Wolverine canon but since none of them are associated with a team that starts with an X, who cares. Plus the Silver Samurai appears, though his storyline in the movie is different than that of the comic. That one aspect slightly sucked, but who knows where the character could morph into in the upcoming twenty follow-up films of the franchise.<br/><br/>Overall The Wolverine was a fun film, and will satisfy some of the fandom that have been waiting for a director to somewhat read the comic before filming. It's not one hundred percent, but at least it's better than having Johnny Blaze and Nicholas Cage anywhere in the same sentence. Go see The Wolverine, and maybe they'll bring back more of the Weapon X that we all got teased on earlier."

","Many had presumed that Marvel's mutated franchise and even their indestructible adamantium machine could not heal after the disappointing releases of X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and then X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009. Nonetheless, the 2011 prequel X-Men: First Class and this 126 minute journey half way across the world to Japan have managed to mend these wounds. The Wolverine unleashes a fresh, X-citing and much anticipated focus on the character that is not impenetrable from criticism but is pretty much what any Wolverine fan and cinemagoer could have hoped for.<br/><br/>The Wolverine opens with the titular character inexplicably placed in Nagasaki, where he rescues a military officer from the tragic atomic blast during The Second World War. In the present day, following the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan, no longer considering himself the Wolverine, wanders the wilderness in anguish over the deaths of those close to him, which he must deal with eternally due to his curse of immortality. <br/><br/>What sets this film apart from other comic-book adventures corresponds to what makes Wolverine a unique character. The Wolverine sees its anti- hero on a quest for death more so than anything else. He does not seek heroics, recognition, justice or anything good, only the privilege of an end to his everlasting misery by death, which is brought to life tremendously by the film's screenplay and of course the Wolverine himself: Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>The Wolverine calmly claws you in almost throughout its run in a beastly variety of ways. The Japanese landscapes provides a fresh setting, and makes the film visually interesting even when we are away from the action. Cinematographer Ross Emery captures the really X-traodinarily beautiful Japanese backdrops that are a refreshing change from New York skyscrapers.<br/><br/>While The Wolverine is great to look at when the beast's claws are retracted, the film is equally appealing when a regrettable soul gives Wolverine a reason to unleash the beast within. Notably, a scene involving a moving train is Class 5, stands out most memorably as the strongest amongst the film's action sequences. The final battle, while albeit a little uninteresting due to its loudness and surrender to clichés, can be forgiven due to its eventual satisfactory outcome. <br/><br/>One unfortunate element to the film that is less forgiving however, probably primarily from my own and comic-book fans' perspective, is the disappointing, unintimidating and lacklustre villain in Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova). The actress is just a little difficult to understand at times, through both voice, and the fact her and the character seem to hold no real motivation or clear threat.<br/><br/>Unlike X-Men Origins: Wolverine, this significantly improved 2013 attempt is considerably well, more considerate to the character, with attention to plot, pacing and overall a more focused and consistent tone. The Wolverine dives claws first into the darkness of its protagonist, exploring how Logan's emotional scars cannot heal and are ever present, becoming increasingly burdening over time as he attempts to fix these unfixable wounds that torture him eternally.<br/><br/>It is almost redundant at this stage, 13 years after the first X-Men film was released, to praise Hugh Jackman for his consistently tremendous and irreplaceable portrayal of Logan/Wolverine. Almost, but not quite. Redundancy can be sliced and forgotten because Jackman simply owns the role of the X-Men's most beloved mutant. I have my suspicions that he actually might be the Wolverine, because the actor does not appear to age and is getting increasingly powerful with each performance. Hugh Jackman simply dominates his character, and hopefully will continue to do so for as long as mutantly possible, which in Wolverine's case, should mean forever.<br/><br/>The Wolverine is one best of the X-Men film franchise, with its cool story, fresh setting, great and appropriately slow pace for a broken character, X-citing action scenes and a mostly perfect cast. The Wolverine may be picked last in class when many retrospectively consider 2013's best comic book adaptations. However, the James Mangold film is so far the surprise pick of the pack as it has exceeded expectations and filled any dubious doubts with cinematic satisfaction. While not quite a match for Superman's Steel, Wolverine's adamantium has far surpassed Iron (Man 3) and now has cinema-goers, comic book fans and I, anticipating next year's addition to the mutated series, X-Men: Days of Future Past."
"KineticSeoul","8","2","5","19 August 2013"," Finally a ""Wolverine"" film that fans wanted
","Unlike the previous movies that featured Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The primary focus on this film is on The Wolverine. And I can assure anyone this film is much better than ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" which was a disappointment. This time it has cool and emotionally driven action sequences, but also has a good story and substance to back it up as well. This time around it does a better job of bringing out the inner being of Wolverine and his character. How he is a complex guy with past scars and is a man with a tortured soul. This film really brings out the ferocity and viciousness when he is rubbed the wrong way and pushed into a corner. It wasn't the amazing story driven Wolverine with a lot of tense, enthralling, exhilarating and compelling that brings out the emotions. Maybe even somewhat close to the level of ""The Dark Knight"". But that is me probably expecting too much. This is still a absorbing film and I am glad it's more adult oriented this time around. It's entertaining all around and the action sequences is grafted into the story very well. It does have few great action sequences, but the primary focus of this film is on Wolverine as a character and his conscience. Now even Hugh Jackman's favorite story arc of Wolverine is the one that takes place in japan. And I am glad they went with this direction. I thought the makers did a great job of bringing that cool Asian vibe into this film. And I am not just talking about the weapons and ninjas either. One of my favorite action sequence is the one that takes place on a bullet train and I liked how they incorporated realism but also a bit over the top and yet cool direction with it. If that makes any sense. Although it slightly reminded me of the final train scene from ""Police Story 3"", wouldn't be surprised if they were inspired by that film at the end. The cast is just right for this film, especially Hugh Jackman as Wolverine who I think is irreplaceable for the role of Wolverine. Unfortunately Hugh Jackman is getting old while his character is ageless or ages very very very slowly. Also this is the most bulk Wolverine has ever been in a film ever. Which shows Jackman's dedication and passion for his work and his character. This is my favorite Marvel film of this year and liked it more than ""Iron Man 3"". If you want to see a Wolverine film, a anti-hero film, or a well paced action film, maybe even cool Asian elements. This one just won't disappoint. The 3D actually adds to the experience.<br/><br/>8.4/10"
"Staffenburgen","7","2","5","19 August 2013"," Light Years Ahead of its Predecessor
","I'd like to start this review by saying that I am not an X-men fan. I haven't seen the trilogy of X-men movies, nor have I seen any other X- men film except for X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I also haven't read any graphic novels associated with the X-men franchise. Having only seen Origins, I really had no desire to delve any deeper into the X-men franchise, but after seeing this film, that all changed. <br/><br/>To put it simply, this film is so much better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine that it makes the movies almost incomparable. The Wolverine has a palatable story, engaging characters, and original and thoughtful action sequences, all of which were lacking in Origins. <br/><br/>Everything that is good about The Wolverine can be traced back to one source; Hugh Jackman. He completely embodies the Wolverine character, conveying a man so tortured by his past that he is tormented by his very existence. A role like that needed to be aced, and Jackman does just that. As the film progresses towards its conclusion, his performance becomes ever-more impressive, and by the end of the film, it's completely impossible to see anyone else playing the role. <br/><br/>In addition to Hugh Jackman, this film has some magnificently crafted action sequences to keep the entertainment level high. One scene in particular, which takes place on top of a speeding bullet train is a real thrill. This served as one of the film's more pleasant surprises, as all the summer's previous superhero movies suffered from repetitive and uninteresting fighting scenes (see Man of Steel and Iron Man 3). <br/><br/>Beyond Jackman and some thoughtful action sequences, this film has its fair share of flaws. While initially the story is pretty good, with enough slow scenes to balance the action, some incredibly engaging expository scenes with the lead actors, and some real human emotion, there is certainly a big drop in quality towards the end. I don't want to spoil anything so that's all I'll say about that. As far as the supporting cast, I honestly had a real tough time believing some of them. In particular, Rila Fukushima stood out in a negative way; her introductory scene is so ridiculous that I was laughing out loud. She does get (much) better as the movie goes on, but she never reaches the level of the cast that surrounds her. In addition to Fukushima, Svetlana Khodchenkova is rather annoying as the lead villain. I suspect this is partially due to my lack of background knowledge concerning her character, but still, she really doesn't do anything to set her aside from the legions of boring generic comic book villains. The rest of the supporting cast didn't stand out in any way, with the exception of Tao Okamoto, who was quite good as Mariko. <br/><br/>One thing I should add is that there is a scene after the credits that is well worth the wait. Having not seen previous X-men movies, I failed to grasp its meaning, but the gasps and general sounds of awe around the theater seemed to suggest it was pretty enjoyable. <br/><br/>All in all, this film is a good movie. Like every movie, it has its flaws, and some of them are difficult to ignore, but there are enough fresh ideas here infused with Hugh Jackman's brand of raw energy to keep you more than entertained. <br/><br/>RATING: 6.5/10"
"dragonmysterious","8","2","5","17 August 2013"," Samurais, Ninjas, and The WOLVERINE!
","An excellent movie that focuses on plot and character development. This movie is not for kids.<br/><br/>The cast of the movie are pretty good. Apart from Hugh Jackman, there is also Tao Okamoto who is not just incredibly pretty, but can also act very well (despite this being her first film). <br/><br/>This movie does a great job of foreshadowing and subtext. Like the scene where Wolverine ends a bear's life to save it from agony, and him confronting hunters who use poisonous arrows.<br/><br/>The movie deals wonderfully with multiple villains, and at the same time, not messing up the movie with too many unnecessary scenes. There are parts that might you chuckle, but there are also parts that make you cringe. This Wolverine movie is a darker tone, compared to Wolverine Origins, and focuses more on Wolverine as the hero than him teaming up with a bunch of other mutants. Not that there is anything wrong with more mutants, but it makes the film more focused.<br/><br/>The plot twist at the end was also dealt well. Just as you were starting to think that Silver Samurai was actually a machine, the big revelation was shown. This movie would have been incredible even if it wasn't a Wolverine movie, but a movie about Samurais and Ninjas. But because of Hugh Jackman, this movie is really awesome. It may not have the destruction capability of Superman or the advanced tech of Iron Man, but it is a really incredible story that focuses on Wolverine with plenty of character development."

","I have to confess that I haven't been following this series (of franchises) religiously but returned to it for this instalment (this might be my first movie in the Wolverine's franchise). Generally I might watch the first in a franchise but stop after that one or the sequel (because they're ""meh""). Fortunately this movie doesn't have anything as silly as a mutant with a gene which affects the weather (!!).<br/><br/>Anyway, in this movie you get to see the title character's back story, as far as his pre-present-day existence...i.e. his time fighting in World War II (at least in the Wolverine's flashbacks or nightmares). An important relationship in this movie is shown in that back story which will lead the Wolverine to return to Japan (where he fought in World War 2) in order to meet the Japanese soldier he was imprisoned by back then.<br/><br/>An interesting element of the plot concerns the offer to Wolverine to give up his invincibility in exchange for a mortal life.<br/><br/>There are some good visuals in this movie (although the 3D option wasn't much of a positive...but I saw the movie on a smallish screen...but I doubt that by itself diminished the effect much) and the fight scene on the bullet train is one of the all time great action sequences, equivalent to the vehicle chases in ""Mad Max 2"" or the car chase in ""For your eyes only"" as far as exhilaration goes. The fight scene is visceral despite obviously being a computer generated effect.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Tao Okamoto as the WWII Japanese soldier's granddaughter Mariko is elegant and beautiful in a Grace Kelly kind of way. Mariko's childhood friend Yukio (Rila Fukushima) puts a praying mantis to mind. Since the film is set in Japan, there are obviously a lot of Japanese names. Following or remembering who was who became an issue for me as a result (i.e. when names were dropped in conversation and that person wasn't there at the time).<br/><br/>There are slow parts to the movie and I liked the incidental Japanese music which I sometimes noticed during these passages. There are also some good incidental jokes in this movie which I liked...e.g. the scene where the Wolverine is required to clean up for a meeting. Also liked the joke about the pool...although I'm sure I've heard the same joke in another movie...I just can't remember which!). Other times there are lots of fights between Wolverine and ninjas or Yakuza. <br/><br/>I get the impression that I missed some back story provided in an earlier movie but it didn't detract too much...i.e. the topic which gives the Wolverine nightmares.<br/><br/>Miscellaneous: <br/><br/><ul><li>The end credits have plenty of crew using Japanese script for their names.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I get the impression that the entire film was shot in Australia, in which case...I didn't notice that it wasn't in Japan! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>As per usual(?) there are sequences from a forthcoming movie featuring at least Wolverine...another X-Men outing it looks like...and I haven't been following that franchise since very early on.</li></ul>"

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine was such a horrible movie that I was a bit suspicious going into this. Now, luckily it's a lot better than that in that it's actually watchable and I enjoyed it at times. I watched it in 2D (I hate 3D) so I can't say whether the 3D effects were done well or not. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is most definitely the Wolverine. He nails the role and he's really never at fault with these movies. The problems are in other areas of the movie. Rila Fukushima does a pretty good job as Yukio for a first performance. Other performances weren't anything special but not bad either. <br/><br/>There were some quite funny bits in the movie. Loved the hotel part especially and the bar scene in the beginning. Wolverine's grumpiness worked really well in these scenes. Japan was a cool setting for the movie and offered some good possibilities for misunderstandings and so on. The bullet train action scene was also quite intense. It was maybe the highlight of the movie which was surprising as it looked a bit goofy in the trailer.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie was a bit off as I was wondering a couple of times about how much there was still to go in the movie. Cinematography was so-so. There was some really annoying shaky cam in the action sequences that almost made me ill. Look to the Bourne movies if you want a model on how to use shaky cam in your movie. The use of shaky cam was especially puzzling because Wolverine was fighting ninjas a lot of the time. Why wouldn't you want us to have a clearer look of that? Shouldn't it be nicely choreographed and so on? <br/><br/>The theme of the movie was immortality and how you can have meaning despite of that. I think it's an interesting theme and I hoped they would've explored that a bit more. Then again this movie was PG-13 so maybe they couldn't do that because they didn't want to alienate the younger viewers. You could really see that they tried to keep the age rating as low as possible in the amount of blood that's in the movie. Never have so many died with so little blood being spilled. A bit of an exaggeration maybe but you get the point.<br/><br/>The plot was only serviceable but the movie really focused more on the characters anyway. The whole world isn't at stake here and the movie takes a more intimate approach. Wolverine's arc during the movie was quite interesting as he tried to deal with his past and find new meaning for his life. The ending was a bit too cartoonish and predictable for my taste. It also deviated too much from the tone of the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>The Wolverine is definitely in the right direction but there's still much that could be improved. The movie needs more focus and it needs to do a better job at creating an emotional connection with the characters. A higher than PG-13 rating would also be nice to see to really allow for a more interesting movie. Still, I wouldn't say I wasted two hours watching this movie."
"stevendbeard","7","2","5","26 July 2013"," Wolverine in Japan
","I saw ""The Wolverine"", starring Hugh Jackman-Les Miserables-2012, Swordfish; Tao Okamoto-a Japanese actress in her first movie; Svetlana Khodchenkova-a Russian actress in her 2nd English movie, her 1st being Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy-2011 and Will Yun Lee-Red Dawn-2012, Elektra.<br/><br/>This is based on an early comic book storyline that centered around the adventures of Wolverine in Japan. The movie starts in WW2, where Hugh, aka Wolverine, saves the life of a Japanese soldier. Then the movie shifts to somewhere right after 'X-Men: the Last Stand', because Hugh is having dreams of Jean Grey-and if you remember, he killed her in that film. Hugh then gets a message to go to Japan because the soldier he saved years ago wants to see him. The soldier has become a big industrialist and is one of the most powerful men in Japan. The only problem is, he is dying and giving his fortune to his granddaughter, Tao. That does not sit well with a lot of people, including Tao's relatives because they were skipped over in the inheritance windfall, so lots of people are trying to kill Tao. Hugh comes to the rescue but runs into a mutant , Svetlana, that goes by the name of Viper and she messes with Hugh's healing factor. Will plays a boyhood friend/bodyguard to Tao. There is a really good fight atop a bullet train-I think it travels around 200-300 mph-there are ninjas-to be expected in Japan-the Silver Samurai and Hugh performs open-heart surgery on.....Well, you have to see it to believe it. There is a scene that sets up the next X-Men movie, right after the credits start, but there is not a scene at the very end. It is rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and sexuality-no nudity except partial nudity of Hugh in a bath tub-and has a running time of 2 hours & 6 minutes. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"cosmonadz","7","2","5","25 July 2013"," Best Wolverine!
","This is the best Wolverine to date. It's fast paced full of action and the story keeps flowing with a few good twists and turns. Hugh Jackman is back to his best with a story following his past present and future. It follows on from an event in Logans past where he is given the chance to have a taste of mortality but obviously at a price. It is mostly set in Japan with stunning sequences and breathtaking scenery. Without making it too complicated the movie flows through the gears and gives a few flashbacks to previous movies. Whereas previous versions have lacked in seriousness this movie maintains a good rhythm throughout. With a good blend of martial arts, samurais, mutants and robots yes that's right robots its an altogether fun action packed film with well directed fight scenes that you'll enjoy immensely. There is a bonus scene for the die hard fans after the credits well worth the wait. Easily watched without having seen any of the previous movies its very enjoyable. Most probably better watched in 2D but I've not had a chance with the 3D yet."
"an-pham1189","1","3","10","13 November 2013"," Dumbest movie I've ever seen.
","And believe me, I'm not picky on action movie. And I love Hugh Jackman. But this movie is just NOT likable, at all. Stupid plot, dumb action, CGI-overloaded boring characters, bad acting, and very very very heavy Japanese accents. I don't think I need to point out any more flaws of this movie - just see through the previous comments. I just want to assure you that all the negative comments ARE true. The plot doesn't only have holes, it can leave you in an amazement that someone actually made a plot like that into a movie. The hero hardy did anything. The acting of two Japanese actresses in this movie is really bad, or I'd rather say ""overdone"", with a ""I'm a mysterious Asian girl"" feeling, hope you know what I mean. And all those Japanese things are forced into the movie. Seriously, as a Japan-lover, I even felt insulted at some points. The only good thing about this movie is Hugh Jackman's face, and while we're at it, let's say his abs too. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
"kidkey","3","3","10","29 July 2013"," I wanted to like The Wolverine...
","I wanted to like The Wolverine, the log line has so many cool elements: samurais and Hugh Jackman being badass... but it wasn't that at all, it was just so bad<br/><br/>Warning, this 'review' is spoilers galore so skip this review entirely if you were planning to watch it but I advise you to either just read this or rent it, because it's awful. I'll setup the plot and then jump into the good and bad.<br/><br/>So the film starts off with the following<br/><br/>Logan being a loner, depressed and having nothing to live for. He looks like a badass hunter and he has nightmares because he killed Jean. He also has flashback nightmares of his past where he saved a Japanese soldier from an atomic bomb. So far so good, the movie looked promising here as we establish Logan's state of mind and his past.<br/><br/>Logan wakes up and we see him being a loner doing nothing with his life but then a bear gets killed by a 'jerk'. Logan overreacts to his bear buddy getting shot with a poison arrow by a jerk and confronts the jerk in the bar, Logan overreacts and we meet Yukio, the badass Asian chick with the power to see when people die.<br/><br/>She says don't worry about the jerk, she's been sent to tell Logan that the man who Logan saved wants to meet him to say goodbye... so they go to Japan...<br/><br/>OK we're in Japan and we establish all the main characters: the obviously evil hot blonde Russian, Asian males who are evil/crazy/useless, the pretty innocent granddaughter that Logan will fall in love with.<br/><br/>Here is the first problem, all the characters except for Logan are rubbish, no fault of the actors, they did the best they could with the story/dialogue but the characters are boring, they all have a one dimensional personality, because of this reason, the film has already set itself up for failure.<br/><br/>The following scenes happen: Dying rich old man that Logan saved tells Logan that he can make him mortal, well the 'twist' is so obvious here. Obviously there's a catch and everything about this old man seems suspicious, especially after the line ""I am not ready to die but you are"".<br/><br/>Logan is like ""Nope, this is weird"" (rightly so), goes away and then we see the granddaughter trying to commit suicide but Logan saves her and Asian guys being jerks...anyway, the old man 'dies' and we go to his funeral but SURPRISE! Hell breaks loose and there is fighting, action and chaos ensues.<br/><br/>People are trying to kill the granddaughter (love interest), Logan saves her!<br/><br/>There is an awesome fight scene on a bullet train! One of the few redeeming action scenes, I enjoyed this, good fun and I wish there was more of this in the movie.<br/><br/>Then it goes back to being awful. The love interest granddaughter/Mariko is stubborn at the beginning saying she doesn't need help but finally accepts Logan's help. They go to a love hotel, this should've been funny but the whole love story here feels very forced, having the 'I killed Jean' flashbacks didn't help and the audience in my cinema thought it was rubbish as well. The love hotel should've been a great setup for humour, something this film lacks. Wolverine's fun never reaches it's potential, the one liners never really take off like they should.<br/><br/>Now they're going to hide in Mariko's hometown and we learn a bit about her past. Honestly this should've been where Logan and Mariko's relationship solidifies but it never feels genuine. It's Hugh Jackman being a lumberjack and we still don't care about the characters. The bad guys aren't too interesting because as the audience we already know they aren't too important, you never feel that Logan is in any danger or pain yet even though he's lost some of his powers.<br/><br/>Logan + Mariko fall in love...maybe, there's a kiss. Mariko gets captured pretty easily, Logan loses her and then Yukio comes back to help Logan. Logan goes after baddies such as Mariko's jerk boyfriend and the bad guys, he also regains his powers.<br/><br/>OK third act, lets go after the baddies and get back Mariko back. Oh hey, that old man that Logan saved...he ain't dead, he's in a giant metal robot and cuts off Logan's claws but I still never felt like he was in danger. Mariko saves Logan using the cut off claws and kills her grandfather. Yay happy ending, that's the gist of the movie...now the good + bad:<br/><br/>GOOD: Hugh Jackman's acting CGI / Special Effects (hit and miss but mostly great) Train Action Sequence<br/><br/>BAD Writing / Character Clichés (The bad kind) Action Scenes; needed more interesting choreography Lack of laughs + fun expected Asian stereotypes galore / Asian guys are depicted as evil/crazy/useless Wolverine's character is less fun + badass than we were expecting Self indulgent time wasted on showing Hugh Jackman shirtless or Tao Okamoto's face Suffers from Blue/Orange Hollywood Colouring Jean / Nightmare / Flashback Overload Transitions to different scenes are lazy and boring, the pace of the movie dies at times...<br/><br/>Overall, I give it 3/10, it's just not a great film, the story is lacking, the action is lacking and there isn't much fun to be had. We all still want an awesome Wolverine movie because Hugh Jackman is a great choice, they had a 2nd chance to make it awesome but instead we got this failure full of actions clichés, plot holes and having wooden characters. I don't know who is to blame, the cast is fine, the direction seems OK, perhaps it's the writing. I'm disappointed we didn't get an awesome Wolverine movie and it has killed my excitement for a new X-men or future Wolverine...I won't get my hopes up again."
"rhl-sachan","4","3","10","28 July 2013"," No action, new movie with melodrama in Wolverine Series
","You can't expect a Hollywood movie to be like Bollywood's melodrama at least not if it belongs to action series of X-men and Wolverine. It is obvious to expect great action sequences but all you get is just a fighting scene on Bullet train. <br/><br/>I have not read marvel's comic so I don't expect it to follow comic storyline. But I was expecting some breathtaking scenes gelled with high intensity moments but all we got is cartoonish fight with a samurai like bot of Admantium in the end. <br/><br/>Most funny part is that Yashida had a lot of Admantium to create a bot but he still needs Admantium from Wolverine. Looks funny right ? To add some more fun, he can easily take Admantium at the age of 60-70 (not disclosed in movie) while even for Wolverine, it was too hard to accept Admantium in his body. <br/><br/>Film fails at many places to give you the same trill you expect from Wolverine. Only reason to watch this movie is being true follower of Wolverine and Hugh Jackman's acting. Every one in the movie has done his part quite brilliantly but director's vision really killed the spirit of movie."

","Considering how much I liked 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' I was actually exited about this movie; especially when I heard it was going to be set in Japan and have a lot of elements of a Yakuza film. I love Japan, especially in Superheroes. And in my naivety I thought there was no way they could botch this. Oh how wrong I was. Following the events of 'X-Men: Last Stand' Wolverine is living by himself and rocking a hobo beard up in Alaska. He is found by another mutant named Yukio who has been sent to find Wolerine. As it turns out he had an old friend from Japan whose life he once saved. The friend is now the head of a powerful Yakuza family but is also dying. Wolverine goes to pay him his last respects but gets caught up in all kinds of family power struggles. This is the set up to an awesome movie and in the hands of a different creative team it might have worked but not here, not with this director, not with these writers, not with these producers, and certainly not with this cast. I know Wolverine is supposed to be a bad ass but if you take out the word bad you're just left with an ass and that's what he in this movie. He's not the hero anymore, he's this obnoxious hero stand-in who we're keeping around until a real hero can be found. The Yakuza angle in this movie is way underutilized, sure there are some cool action scenes but they're shot so poorly and use so much CGI that they end up being boring. I should never be able to say that about a man with claws fighting a pair of guys on top of a speeding train, with katanas and guns! With the exception of Yukio and Wolverine, but only because there's so much of him, the characters in this movie are bland especially the weak villains, the worst offender is Madam Hydra who is technically an Avengers villains but she's also a mutant so she's kinda stuck in the middle and they apparently had to cut back some of her aspects which may be why she is so one dimensional; Poison Ivy from 'Batman & Robin' was more interesting because at least she had a personality. Wolverine's character development in this is nonexistent; his main thing is that he losses his regenerative powers briefly which might have been interesting if it was actually used but instead it just serves to try and make the fight scenes more interesting. This movie's cardinal sin is its run time, two hours but not like 'Lord of the Rings' where every minute is important but because Superhero movies are supposed to be two hours and so we need to pad this film out. This movie takes a perfect concept and completely waists it."
"moviemattb","10","2","6","18 May 2014"," ""The Wolverine"" is a big improvement over the last Wolverine movie
","After ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" came out five years ago, which it receive many mixed or negative reviews by critics and fans alike were not satisfied with the final results on how the movie did. I used to love it, but not anymore because ""The Wolverine"" is a big improvement over the last Wolverine movie. James Mangold is a much capable director to make the Wolverine movie as it should be. The last Wolverine movie tried to be a character study, but it was poorly executed; this movie did better. The story is well told and it does manage to be more faithful to the Wolverine comics because our main character does go to Japan, and fall in love with Mariko. Hugh Jackman gives an amazing performance, and should be more proud for this movie. Jackman admitted it that the last Wolverine movie didn't do well as he thought it would. The rest of the Japanese cast all did well for there parts. Famke Janssen returning as Jean Grey did fine, but nothing special I can say. I can say that for Wolverine's character does work for his downer side because he kill Jean on the third X-Men, and we do actually feel bad for him. The music by Marco Beltrami is actually really good, which it does differ from Harry Gregson- Williams's score. The special effects are much better than the last one, and thankfully, the claws went back from CG to practical. The movie did kept me interest for what is going on, and never I got bored from it. The third act is what most people complained about. To me, I don't think its that bad as what others say. I still think is on par with the first two acts of the movie, and never thought it was that campy. If it was, then maybe the first two acts would be campy, and it be like watching Joel Schumacher's Batman movies. I mean you got to least have some action in the third act, where we do go into a big climax like most other superhero movies. To be honest, I did not grew up with X-Men that much because I was more a Batman fan. I grew up with the show a bit, but not the comics; its just how I see it, and how I feel about it. If you don't like how the third act went that is fine, but I don't think its really that bad. My only problem is that I wish if this movie treats ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" like it never exist, but if its here to stay so be it. ""The Wolverine"" is by far my favorite X-Men because I was more intrigued to the Wolverine than any other X-Men characters. If ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" tops this movie, then it might be my favorite. I give ""The Wolverine"" a 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I originally give this movie a 9 out of 10, but now I am giving it a 10 out of 10 because I just saw ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" in theaters which made my problems go away. See my review for ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" and no it will not contain any spoilers. Thank you."

","'The Wolverine' stars Hugh Jackman, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Svetlana Khodchenkova. Hugh Jackman is of course great in this film, like he always has been as wolverine. The wolverine is Hugh Jackman. He nails the role in every way. The rest of the cast and the supporting cast also do very well. I had no doubt that any of them were who they portrayed in their role. Svetlana Kohchenkova did really well as the main antagonist in the film. She had that ""bad guy"" feeling that went along with her the whole time. The only problem I have with the acting is that some of the actors overacted their role. They brought the acting too far and it was over the top.<br/><br/>The story was also good. It had a clear conflict, adventure, and task at hand for most of the time. When it got to then, it wasn't like that, but the end was only a little part of the film. For most of the film there are certain reasons characters fight, and what they fight for. They have their motivations and their weaknesses. The characters were all very rich. They didn't need to do much character development on wolverine because we know who he is, but they let us know what he is like now. It also developed the other characters well and gave them back stories. 'The Wolverine' was not all about wolverine. It was about the situation at hand and many of the characters. It was still focused, but it didn't stay on one thing the whole time."

","The Wolverine totally surprises me (in the good way). From what I saw in the trailer I'm pretty sure this gonna suck but after giving it a try I glad I did went to see it. They truly revive the franchise and now it is so much joy watching it.<br/><br/>I love the story. They connect it well with the previous movies without trying too hard. What best was they decide to concentrate on develop a better story and does so by developing each character and overloading it with zillion mutant. It is basically 2 hours of fun and action and despite it is PG13 it is ain't soft.<br/><br/>In-fact there is very little characters in the movie. The casting was not bad and the acting was better and well suited than some Hollywood big name that was in previous installment. Hugh is at his top physical form, Tao Okamoto as Mariko is just stunning!! Truly gorgeous!! And despite it is her first movie she did a magnificent job. Other characters are also suited well too.<br/><br/>The action sequences and the fighting moves are just awesome. Add to that the change of location to the beautiful scenery of Japan really help the movie from looking very cliché. <br/><br/>All in all I love the movie. This is just the Wolverine I was waiting for. Can't wait for the unrated version that they going to release on the DVD - will definitely adding that into my collection. Highly recommended while it is still in the theatre.<br/><br/>Rating: 8"
"McGrit","Null","2","6","8 August 2013"," The characters, effects, and story were all beyond outstanding
","The Wolverine continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. Welcome back Logan, now hand him back to Bryan Singer for the next X-Men film! The characters, effects, and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. Like back in X2, we are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be. It's better then everything not X2 (including First Class) in every single way that matters yet it's unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The FX and pace are superb. I honestly could see the FX being Oscar nominated here whereas the FX in Origins was TV show bad. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that was absent from Origins and every non-Marvel genre film of the past few years.<br/><br/>This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other films that I've seen this summer, the supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner. I loved Mariko! The other newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. Silver Samuari and the twist with him is remarkable. The cast selection is still perfect and I hope this spawns more Wolverine solo films but they left it as if this was the perfect end to Hugh's run."
"The_Wannabe_Critic","10","2","6","5 August 2013"," Excellent movie! Trailer and clips were majorly misleading.
","As an X-men, Marvel and movie fan all together, I thought this was an excellent movie. Don't base this movie off of the trailers and clips. I wanted to see this movie until I saw the trailer. After that, I thought the storyline was going to be cheesy and dumb. Going against my original judgment, I decided to give the movie a chance and it turned out to be one of the best X-men movies to date.<br/><br/>The storyline was very interesting and kept you interested to the very end. What amazed me was that every scene in this movie was meaningful regarding to the storyline. There were no unnecessary scenes just to take up film time. I really liked how accurate the storyline was as far as Japanese history and the ways of a samurai (like how to hold a katana and the definition of a ronin). I also liked that there was humor in this movie and it wasn't cheesy. I actually bursted out laughing a few times.<br/><br/>The supporting characters were fantastic and the fight choreography was outstanding. I think this was a perfect movie to tie-in the gap between X-men 3: The Last Stand and X-men: Days of Future Past.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold really impressed me with the direction of the movie and the camera shots were intriguing. Besides giving major props to Hugh Jackman for playing Wolverine (which he is always good at) I really thought Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukushima's acting abilities were impressive considering this was Tao's first movie and Rila's second.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an excellent movie. I can't believe some of the users' reviews about this movie being inaccurate and having plot holes. I went into this movie being very critical and found nothing wrong with it. Also, I know most of Wolverine's comic book history and there was nothing out of line.<br/><br/>So go see it! I saw it twice and loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>P.S. Stick around for the cut-scene in the beginning of the credits. One of the best cut-scene's I've seen and gives you an idea of how the plot is going to go in X-men: Days of Future Past."
"kgprophet","4","2","6","5 August 2013"," Slow Pacing and Detached Hero Underwhelms
","I already gave this movie bonus points for daring to be small and actually shoot some scenes on location in Japan. It dawned on me how the X-Men franchise went the opposite direction as the Avengers. X-Men began as an ensemble then broke the characters off (Magneto and Xavier as part of X-Men first class & the first Wolverine). Avengers introduced the main players on their own before combining them. The problem with the X-Men franchise is that the Wolverine character on it's own leaves something to be desired. <br/><br/>It feels like The Wolverine set out to be the antithesis of the standard super hero movie. But I think they swung the pendulum a little too far the other way. I fault the motivations of Wolverine in this smaller film. He is supposed to be always gruff and not interested in helping anyone. But he is somehow convinced to go to Japan based on a man he helped 60 years ago but never maintained contact. I think he should have been someone a bit more deeply connected to Yashida and his life was in danger, not just a visit to his deathbed. <br/><br/>I don't require a summer film to be non-stop action, but the pacing in this film still could use some spark. The time spent setting up the characters in Japan is too sedate. You can spark the story along by learning about these characters while taking action. I think of the pacing in the Bourne movies. Wolverine's exposure to the Yakuza threat should have been through confrontation, not exposition by his designated sidekick. The slow cooking plot is just not tautly edited to create any real momentum. The story itself lacks any real surprises, and Wolverine's tepid involvement just gave the whole movie an emotional detachment. I will credit the female lead, Tao Okamoto, as being both attractive and a credible actress. I found her somewhat a sympathetic character, but in the end, the clumsy setup didn't allow her important opening scene to transpire with the gravitas the movie wanted. <br/><br/>I think of the gravitas thrust upon us in the latest Bond film ""Skyfall"", and it all seems to come back to Wolverine's detachment with Yashida, the person he dispassionately is supposed to say goodbye to on his deathbed. We needed another scene after the exciting Nagasaki bomb sequence, where Wolverine and Yashida bond after saving his life. I was thinking perhaps Yashida taught martial arts to Wolverine and we see Logan for once have a home (playing into the whole Samurai and Master relationship). Maybe a subsequent flashback where Logan parts ways with Yashida, perhaps over a dispute that could resonate in the present day. So much more punch was possible in the storytelling. Alas, there is generic exposition, despite the attractive oriental setting. <br/><br/>As for the new mutants, I found the sidekick Yukio a lame mutant, but a terrific character nonetheless. Straight out of Tarantino's fun ""Kill Bill Part 2"" or Rodriguez's ""Sin City"", the innocent schoolgirl with deadly fighting skills made her by far the most interesting character in the film. Her supposed special talent is to foresee someone's future. But yet she never demonstrates that ability. The other is the actual villain of the movie, Viper. She is an intense young woman who can blow poison gas, or train insects to burrow into your heart, or something. Her evil powers were pretty lame as well. As for Yashida, the industrialist who wants immortality, that also seems half-cooked. <br/><br/>The third act throws in some special effects that frankly seem out of place for a film that quite deliberately made a point of NOT being that type of film. The pacing of this film should have taken more of a Bourne approach, and let Wolverine show a little more empathy for other humans, instead of wallowing in his depression of Jean Grey. Wolverine could have been like the new Bond in his motivations, and not perpetually detached.<br/><br/>I'd wait for the DVD."

Kudos to HJ, he puts everything into it and it shows. OH ya, HE's RIPPED TOO!!!<br/><br/>Nice twist near the end with some shocking outcome. This movie also sets up a new character, of which we will most certainly re-visit sometime down the road.<br/><br/>I would give it a 10, but although I enjoyed the seductive Viper character, many questions are left open concerning history and purpose. But then again, like other XMEN films, we are often teased with new character's only to have them taken away before we get to really know or understand them. (AKA - like Gambit in X-Men Origins: Wolverine). Pretty tight action scene's with a bit of jerky camera work, but for the most part you can follow the action.(I prefer stop/slow motion as in 300, it's prettier...like nice artwork).<br/><br/>Go see it.

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3/5 stars<br/><br/>Not as good as any of the previous X-Men films, including the under- appreciated ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". Some actions scenes are very well done, but the rest fall pretty flat, including the anti-climatic finale. The plot does resemble one of our clawed superhero's fable comic books, but it isn't executed to perfection or anywhere near it. Plus, some necessary back-story's and character arcs weren't properly developed we are left feeling a bit cheated.<br/><br/>In hindsight, if it wasn't for the charismatic Hugh Jackman, ""The Wolverine"" mightn't have even turned out to be half decent as it is. Here's hoping that Wolverine's next solo effort surpasses or is at least as good as the character's first cinematic installment."
"pieginodino","Null","2","6","1 August 2013"," GREAT FILM! This really is the Wolverine film we should have seen long ago.
","The Wolverine is a well-written film with superb performances all around. The script is admirable and develops the character in interesting ways, continuing and exploring themes from the X-Men films. Yet, you need not have seen even one of those films to enjoy this experience. And, this movie truly is an experience. It's thrilling and so very well constructed. Also, when it's time for action...Look out!<br/><br/>The Wolverine deepens, darkens and expands upon the character beautifully. Logan is an outsider, has this tendency towards berserker rage, frequently regrets lashing out and is not able to find much peace in the world and now we know why. Being immortal hurts. The character journey and Japanese subtext is simply wonderful."
"tttl4077","Null","2","6","29 July 2013"," Superb In Every Way
","I've used this colloquialism before but ""X marks the spot"" and there are plenty of big action scenes throughout this amazing movie that it has to be called spectacular. Wolverine goes ballistic train in a good way and rivals the train sequence from Spider-Man 2. It's action with a nice mix of smarts and fun. I don't understand how anyone can complain about that awesome ending. After delivering adventure and a superb set up, they deliver action in just the right amount for the third act. For example, one of the few complaints about the first two Iron Man movies was that the pay off and third acts were lacking in action. No one can credibly say that with this film. What hits here is the best film of the summer in my mind.<br/><br/>For the task of making a great stand alone film that could still be considered a sequel on some level that offered more then the first and was able to expand on the X-Men trilogy - it exceeds all expectations. The pace is better, the effects are better, the writing is superb, the additional characters were nicely patched in, Wolverine kicked backside, and overall this is one fine action film."
"ScottBang","Null","2","6","29 July 2013"," GREAT FILM that delivers an austere, intense vibe!
","Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman brought the character to the next level like he deserved to do. He is finally part of a Wolverine movie that truly showcases the true character and the true coolness of that character. The Wolverine has a more subdued tone than any of Logan's past screen appearances. They did reflect on the books as Logan is grim and silent throughout the entire first half of Act One. The austere, intense vibe of the piece is reminiscent of the solemnity of the 1980s Chris Claremont/Frank Miller comic book storyline upon which the film is based. It's not a direct adaptation of course but it's very true to that classic storyline and tone.<br/><br/>What is it with great comic book movies and train scenes? Spider-Man 2 delivered an all-time comic book movie highlight and now The Wolverine may have done it one better! The entire movie is awesome but the train sequence may be the highlight of the year. Logan takes on a number of Yakuza inside a Japanese train car and, because of a plot turn, he's VERY vulnerable. With his life on the line, It's full on berserker rage that we all wanted to see! This is a perfectly realistic and wonderfully choreographed fight and the best gritty action in any X-realted film to date by far. They play with the claustrophobic space of the train car and that adds another unique element. When the action shifts to on top of the train car, it's as good if not better than what we saw in Spider-Man 2. I say better because the entire fight demands Logan use some thought in how he'll attack; it's not just slash, hack, slash. At super high speeds, it becomes a game of chess with the deadly Yakuza. As with the rest of the film, here the film delivers some excellent and fitting humor that never breaks the tension but is perfect and adds to the enjoyment. This is a terrific action scene and one terrific movie."
"MakoMori","6","2","6","28 July 2013"," Good action scenes with mishandled concepts
","The Wolverine: Film Review<br/><br/>***** SPOILERS BELOW********<br/><br/>As the film opens the audience is presented with a flash into Logan's past. He is solider of fortune looking for meaning rather than wealth. This meaning is manifested through the saving of a Japanese soldiers life. A man, with whom he did not know but had one identifying characteristic that they were both given the opportunity to die. This scene set the tone for the film. Yashida the solider had to choose his fate, he decided to live. Would Logan do the same when presented with the same ultimatum? <br/><br/>The story continues with Logan shown in his present depressed state. He is a man who is in an identity crisis. Stuck in a reverie between his ideal dream life with Jean and his currant life. He pursues fleeting memories of Jean and she consumes his life giving him an artificial purpose. She becomes all he thinks about. But Logan has a nagging part of himself, which recognizes that pursuing the dead is a false purpose. In turn causing him to travel back to Japan to face the most scared of all human kinds ultimatums –the choice of life or death.<br/><br/>I felt like the scenes following the flashback lacked meaning. The relationship presented between Jean and Logan was unconvincing and in need of conviction. Logan was willing to put his life hold for Jean. She should have been a haunting and all consuming presence. When given the opportunity to leave his environment he seemed all too willing. Theses scenes should have conveyed the two conflicting sides Logan: The part of himself that was willing to let his life be consumed by jean, and the other half which recognized that in pursuing Jean he would give his life no meaning. When he left for Japan he appeared unscathed, and continued the trend for the majority of the film. I would have preferred Logan to have an ultimatum presented to him at some point in the film. <br/><br/>Logan is pursued by another telepath Yukio who is hired by Yashida to track Logan down; she has the ability to predict the death of people. This character adds a fantastic layer to the story underlying the central theme of life and death. When Logan arrives he is greeted with the wealth of the solider he saved. Yashida has become the wealthiest man in Japan. Logan pays his respect to the dying soldier but is then given a proposition -the ability to pass on his power of mortal life onto another.<br/><br/>When Logan refuses, the following day Yashida dies and Logan attends his funeral. Just as Mariko the granddaughter, beloved prize and heir to Yashida's fortune says her final wishes a Japanese organized crime group attacks the funeral to capture Mariko.<br/><br/>The next scenes feature well choreographed fights between Logan and the crime members. Mariko's childhood friend Yukio is also present and well used in the fight scenes. The train sequence was especially thrilling with well-done stunt work and CGI.<br/><br/>The plot continues with Logan and Mariko escaping to a safe house on the south side of Japan. Logan, a usually indestructible fighter is now injured although he cannot recall the cause. (Which was an infection given to him by a mutant attendant by Yashida). Logan's feelings on the loss of his mortality are not expanded upon. I would have liked this to become a catalyst for Logan, which he would have to meditate on. Logan, for the first time in his life, was not an indestructible solider. Logan's lack of internal conflict made his overall character arc stagnant rather than the dynamic and conflicting. <br/><br/>Logan and Mariko's relationship is explored during their first dinner at the safe house. Mariko reveals that her earlier suicide attempt was because of her inheritance. She was unwilling to face her cruel father and fiancé. This sparks a romantic relationship between Mariko and Logan.<br/><br/>The theme of suicide and honour felt overlooked in this film. Logan, Mariko and her grandfather have the option to commit suicide at a turning point in their lives. I feel if this common theme was explored it would have created a uniting thread. Also the character discourses of suicide would offer the opportunity to explore the perceptive, generational, and cross-cultural differences of the honour present in life and in death.<br/><br/>Mariko is taken from the safe house and Logan pursues her captors, and interrogates Mariko's fiancé for information. He arrives back at her grandfather's estate with Yukio. Logan must preform his own surgery to remove his the virus in his heart, which prevents him from healing. A scene, which Yukio predicted, would kill him. As Logan is preforming surgery Mario's father arrives in an attempt to kill him, leaving Yukio to defend Logan. <br/><br/>This scene shows the human side of Logan. He is a person who in the moment must rely on someone else to save his life. He must also preform his own surgery creating a physical image of ""to find salvation within"". Logan realizes a samurai can find a sensei within himself. <br/><br/>Logan is able to cheat death and continue his pursuit to Mariko. When he arrives Logan is faced with a masked machine and enemy of equal caliber. Logan fights for his life as he is drained of his mortality. On the brink of death Yashida is revealed to be the one taking his life. Once again Logan finds himself reliant of those around him, Mariko kills her grandfather saving Logan's life. <br/><br/>Logan, having been faced with death decides to make peace with Jean. Leaving her in the past and once again embarks on the path of finding meaning to life. <br/><br/>Overall I think The Wolverine had some great concepts and themes. However, the executions of those themes were not always appropriate. J"
"angil_x","6","2","6","27 July 2013"," The best version of Wolverine but
","Why oh why can't Hollywood stay true to the characters and their abilities? Wolverine survives an atomic bomb, but his body doesn't reject a robotic spider placed in it? The Silver Samurai is a bad guy but he is an honorable bad guy. This version of him is not. Also he is not supposed to be a technology based bad guy. See this is the same BS we saw in Iron Man three, and I for one am getting tired of it! The Mandarin was a fake. There seems to be an unwillingness to deal with magical or non technology based power. God knows if there is ever a Dr Strange movie he'll be fighting a robot, android, or some technological power based bad guy also. I think the bad guys and their motives were the weakest ingredients in this movie. These are fantastic characters, Hollywood. Stop toning them down. If the writers can't handle the fantastic get capable writers."

","I enjoyed it. However, I'm not a big fan of super hero movies where they've lost their powers. I go to super hero movies to see super heroes enjoying their powers, at times abusing their powers, coping with their powers, and doing super hero things... and all while the 'normal' people in the movie are either awe struck, need protection, are love interests, and/or are getting out of the way of the action... Just not a big fan of super hero movies where the screen writers say ""let's have a super hero movie where their powers are lost and they're having to struggle and overcome that in the movie..."" I think the same problem was with Iron Man 3... Tony Stark had to cope without having his suit for a large part of the movie... well, Wolverine has to cope with not healing very fast for a large part of the movie."
"achyutaghosh","8","2","6","27 July 2013"," Steel vs Adamantium- scintillating clash
","There is a reason the X Men in the movies are best in a team- none of them are charismatic enough to pull a movie on their own. Except perhaps Wolverine. The very extension of this tortured loner's superpowers is cause for incomparable pain. And his immortality which means living forever with the choices that one makes, can be a curse too. While the 2009 wolverine origins movie was a cartoonish effort, this one though draws from one of the most inspirational arcs in the Wolverine comics lore- the 1983 Claremont/Miller miniseries. <br/><br/>Japan's importance may be declining in the world, but Hollywood's fascination with Japan only seems to be rising. Couple of weeks back it was Pacific Rim, and this week it is Wolverine. The time-line is somewhere after the events of X Men Last Stand. Wracked with guilt over killing Jean Grey, Logan renounces his world saving days, he retreats into the Alaskan mountains, to befriend the occasional grizzly, take on errant hunters, stay away from hair and care products and chit chatting with Jean's ghost. His miserable existence takes an unexpected turn when he summoned to Japan by someone whose life he had saved during the Nagasaki bombing in the second world war. Yashida, a humble army commandant then, is now the most powerful man in Japan spearheading an industrial conglomerate. Yashida offers Logan the chance to let go of his superpowers so that he can lead a normal life. Logan refuses but anyways loses his regenerative powers, and quickly gets entangled into a web of blood and deception involving everything Japan- ninjas, yakuzas, katanas, martial arts, bullet trains and steel.<br/><br/>This is Hugh Jackman's sixth turn at this character and he looks positively tired, but powers up whenever the action demands. The Japanese characters are stereotype Asian, while the only other mutant in the movie is slinky as a viper. Director James Mangold tries to stick close to the source, with a number of shots that are straight off the graphic comic book's panels. Logan needing a bodyguard takes some time to sink in, while the humor is mostly derived from his devil may care attitude. There is plenty of action though, with Logan slicing off yakuzas and ninjas an intermittent feature. The sequence on top of the bullet train particularly energetic, along with a climactic fight to the finish with the Silver Samurai.<br/><br/>As a theme Wolverine eschews global annihilation and explosive set pieces in favor of an intimate take. Think of this as a samurai movie, with the hero wielding adamantium instead of steel. To put things into perspective, the only explosion in the entire movie is the one at the start at Nagasaki, and that too is pictured at a distance. Wolverine in a way is the picture the character always deserved- aptly showcasing his torment, inner struggles and his quest for the meaning of his life. This is more than just popcorn entertainment, it is a solid action thriller. Those seeking a world threatening tale need to wait for the post credits scene."
"rahuljonathan-nair","8","2","6","27 July 2013"," A decent watch!
","To be honest, the Japan-set storyline, and the absence of enough mutants gives this film a feel far removed from the typical X-Men movie. Also it's considerably darker than most blockbuster films, both in terms of the violence and the mature themes it explores. If you don't go in expecting the lightness of an X-Men film, chances are you'll come away entertained. I'm going with a generous 8 out of 10 stars. Don't forget to stay in your seat for an exciting post-credits sequence that sets up next year's 'X- Men: Days of Future Past' that'll likely give die-hard fans more of the stuff they expect from an X-Men movie...the stuff that's missing here. The 3D effects were OK and the main factor for the success of this movie is Hugh Jackman who gives a bang performance!"

","A Good action thriller which you can expect from X-Men movie but not something extraordinary which you want to remember for long once you are out from the hall. This time Wolverine goes to Japan on the request of a dying Japanese lord who long back was saved by Logan during Nagasaki disaster. Now the real story begins ...story of love, story of betrayal, ugly family politics for power, Ninjas, Good and Bad mutants (thankfully only one on each side!) and most important few really amazing action scenes like one on the top of bullet train. There were few glimpses of Jeane in Logan's dream portraying his frustrations, loneliness and pain which added a different dimension to Hugh Jackman's character. Jackman was brilliant no doubt."

"Jtm1583","5","2","6","26 July 2013"," I've seen worse comic book adaptations.
","The Wolverine is in no way the worst super hero movie I've seen, but I wouldn't exactly call it good either. The problem is less with the plot, though the ""twist"" is laughable, or the special effects (my usual complaints with a movie like this) and more with the characters. I'll rate it piece by piece: Plot: 6/10- I've seen worse (Superman Returns) but the twist pretty much takes any positive points this story has in my eyes. Characterization: 4/10- The characters seem disjointed, and almost confused throughout the movie. They may act completely different in one scene than they did the one before. A good example {spoiler} is the way Wolverine is sleeping with an engaged woman and then grows angry when he walks in on the woman's fiancé with two hookers not ten minutes later {end spoiler}. My biggest complaint on this front, however, is the fact that one of the main characters is completely useless and does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. Nothing. Literally, zero. Nothing. Special Effects/ Action: 8/10- The bear at the beginning of the movie is the only point in which it grows weak. However, I do feel like the whole movie (most movies, actually) would benefit from smaller scale action sequences. The scene {spoiler} on top of the train, while cool, is ridiculous, while many of the smaller scale fight scenes like the one at the funeral seemed to be more immersive and better done than the CGI heavy scenes like the train and the final fight. {end spoiler} Writing (Dialogue): 7/10- The dialogue is believable enough, though it still doesn't account for the obvious character behavior anachronisms. Acting: 7/10- They all did what they could. Bottom line: worth seeing if you're a comic book fan, but save your money until it hits a redbox."

Reminded me of Elektra, which I love and Kill Bill, which I also love. And of course, Hugh Jackman who rules the roost after a well deserved bath and some manicure. He really makes it sound believable. Like others, I found the silver samuraï part silly. Was there really a need to delve into an Iron Man kind of opponent. But what the hell. Show me a man who wouldn't want to be immortal and strong with shiny throat slicing metal spikes coming from his fists. Would do wonder for any weakling self esteem, as far as I'm concerned. But that's what this kind of movies are there for. It releases the brave and courageous inside of each of us. That's what we like about such films. However too many mutants in a movie dilutes the fantasy for me. One is enough, like Elektra, Kiddo in KB and Wolverine. Much easier to root for one do gooder than too many of them. So now I'm waiting for another Wolverine movie. Well done!"

","Let me just say that Hugh Jackman's acting was once again amazing. He reprises his role of Wolverine brilliantly and really showed the emotional turmoil that Logan was going through. The other actors/actresses in this movie were pretty much average.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that Jean Grey had appearances in this movie. It really added to the story. I also liked the idea of Logan losing his healing powers.(credit to the comics) The first bit of the movie portrayed him losing his powers well and in my opinion that was one of the strongest parts of the movie. But as we progressed into the movie, Wolverine quickly got back his healing powers. I didn't really like the fact that he received his powers back so quickly. After this event, I became a little disappointed with the movie. There was a lot of build ups to the climax which I got bored through. The climax was good and I especially liked the unveiling of the Silver Samurai. <br/><br/>Wolverine losing his metal claws was unexpected but it was done well.<br/><br/>But my favorite part of the movie(and the only real reason I watched the movie) is the end credits scene when Professor X and Magneto are both alive and powerful. The dialogue for this scene is astonishing. It was a very exciting scene."
"CMTiago","7","1","2","4 August 2014"," Good personal story, but lack of enthusiasm
","Starting a bit off topic here, but usually the Christopher Nolan films get bashed by their detractors for their serious, grounded approach that in their view takes out the fun of watching a superhero movie. Being a huge fan of those movies, I strongly disagree, as the conclusions to those films have a great climax and you can actually feel some excitement. In The Wolverine, however, I didn't exactly feel that.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Logan/Wolverine saving a Japanese soldier during the Nagasaki bombing in 1945. Now 60 years have passed, and Logan is wandering alone in the woods, mourning Jean Grey, who had died at his hands in X-Men: The Last Stand. He is summoned to Japan by the man he saved in the past. A now dying old man who seeks Wolverine's immortality. Through a web of deceit and a world he does not know, Wolverine must fight his inner demons, while also protecting Mariko, the grand daughter of old man Yachida.<br/><br/>The individual story is always one of the more unique in the X-Men universe, and this movie tried to show us Wolverine, the troubled mutant, instead of presenting us with Wolverine, the bad ass mutant seeking revenge, like X-Men Origins: Wolverine did in 2009. This was an idea I was fond of, since it could actually turn into an interesting movie plot. The execution, though, was mixed. Once again, I think the focus of the film is spot on, but in the end I didn't feel like I was watching an awesome comic book movie. Instead the mood was overall OK, and the movie isn't shockingly bad, but still more could have been done.<br/><br/>While I still wait to watch X-Men: Days Of Future Past, it's good to see Hugh Jackman owning his iconic role yet again, even if it is a lesser X- Men film. I guess I have to wait just a little bit more to experience ,what I hope is, an excellent X-Men movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"
"danamadeus","7","1","2","29 June 2014"," Almost Great! (very very very minor spoiler, not even a really a spoiler)
","The Wolverine is Hugh Jackman's second outing, (if you count that first abysmal piece of trash) as the character, and let me just say right off, I loved this movie!.mostly. The Wolverine is an awesome, character-driven, badass comic book film..or at least two thirds of one. <br/><br/>One of the coolest things about The Wolverine is it very closely follows the story-line of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's definitive miniseries about the character. The film picks up sometime not too long after The Last Stand and we first see our hero bumming around through the mountains in his grief over Jean Grey's death at his clawed-hands. Logan is in somewhat of a slump and at a crossroads when he meets a woman named Yukio while he's in the middle of beating up some hunters in a bar. She gives him an invitation to come to Japan at the request of an old, dying industrialist who's life Logan saved in WWII. With not much else going on, Logan accepts and meets with the man, Yoshida, who offers Logan the chance to become mortal by transferring his healing powers to him. Logan declines and shortly after, Yoshida dies. Chaos ensues from there when the funeral is attacked by Yakuza assassins and Logan discovers his regenerative powers have ceased healing his wounds. Logan makes it his mission to protect Yoshida's granddaughter, the beautiful Mariko and flees with her to get her somewhere safe.<br/><br/>There are so many strong aspects of the movie. For one, there's a solid director this time around in James Mangold, who gives the film both style and subtlety that marks an immediate quantum leap in quality from the last Wolverine movie. The storyline is also compelling as it's a personal story that focuses on Logan's inner struggle, his never-ending journey and his relationship with Mariko. It doesn't shove a bunch of one-dimensional, under-developed mutants in the movie just for fan-service, (insultingly cynical fan-service at that). The movie has focus, it has humor, character, and some pretty kick-ass action. One particular sequence that has to be mentioned as a stand-out is the fight on top of a moving bullet-train; one of the best-executed and most thrilling action sequences I've ever seen. The movie deftly balances and alternates between character moments and action and gives you a story you can actually care about. The problem with the movie: ..the last third goes downhill in very pronounced, overt kind of way. You can just feel that it starts to lose steam and they drag it out simply because every comic book movie has to have a dragged-out, over-the-top finale. And that's what it has. The movie has a really cheesy, underwhelming climax, and ""The Viper"" is a lame, borderline annoying villain. It's so unfortunate that's the case, because otherwise this is an awesome movie. I liked all the characters and their portrayals, (aside from Viper), from Mariko to the evil Shingen, to Logan's ""Bodyguard"" Yukio. I did like the actual ending, (before the credits) of Logan on the plane, (still afraid of flying!) with Yukio, and them going wherever he goes next together, but with the events of DOFP, it doesn't' seem like any continuation of that is possible. <br/><br/>Overall, The Wolverine does right by the character and the storyline it's based on, which is a real rarity. I can see why there are divided views on the movie, it has a lot of good, as well as some great and some lame. I think though, the more you care about the character, the more you'll enjoy it. 7.7/10"
"jboothmillard","6","1","2","27 May 2014"," The Wolverine
","Wolverine has appeared in every Marvel X-Men film so far, including a cameo in First Stand, The Last Stand was disappointing, and the Origins of the title character could have been a little better, but he gets his second solo adventure here, from director James Mangold (Cop Land; Girl, Interrupted, Identity, Walk the Line, Knight and Day). Basically the films opens in 1945 where Logan (Hugh Jackman) was being held in a Japaense POW camp, and in the atomic bombing of Nagasak he rescues and shields young soldier Yashida (Ken Yamamura) from the blast. In present day Logan has become a recluse, following the death of his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who he was forced to kill, he is haunted by her memory, he is found in Yukon by mutant Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who has the ability to see people's deaths, she has come on behalf of older Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), now a technology corporation CEO, he wants to repay his life debt to Logan before he dies of cancer. In Tokyo Logan meets Yashida's son Shingen (Ring's Hiroyuki Sanada) and granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto), he is offered the chance to pass on his healing abilities and immortality, which he sees as a curse, on to Yashida, to make him mortal and save the old man's life, Logan refuses, but before he can leave Yashida's physician Dr. Green, aka Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) puts something into his body, and the next morning he is informed that Yashida has died. Yakuza gangsters show up at the funeral and attempt to kidnap Mariko, but Logan saves her and they escape to urban Tokyo, during the chase Logan is shot and his wounds do not heal as they should, another chase and assassination attempt occurs on a bullet train, but the thugs are defeated and Logan and Mariko make it to a love hotel to hide, meanwhile Yashida's bodyguard Harada (Die Another Day's Will Yun Lee) demands he finds them. The pair reach Nagasaki and Yashida's house, they slowly fall for each other, Yukio meanwhile has seen a vision of Logan dying and must warn him, before she arrives Mariko is kidnapped by the Yakuza gangsters, but information leads Logan and Yukio to corrupt Minister of Justice, also Mariko's fiancé, Noburo Mori (Austin Powers in Goldmember's Brian Tee), he confesses a conspiracy was started because Yashida left his fortune to Mariko, not Shingen, also in on the plan. Mariko meanwhile is taken by ninjas led by Haraka, while Logan and Yukio arrive and use the specialist X-ray machine to see that Logan has a robotic parasite attached to his heart, suppressing his healing abilities, he cuts himself open to get it out while Shingen comes in to attack Yukio, Logan dies on the operating table, like Yukio saw in her vision, but he recovers and kills Shingen. Logan heads for Yashida's birth place to find Mariko, but he is captured by the Harada's ninjas and taken to Viper, she reveals her plan to take his healing abilities, and he comes face to face with an electromechanical suit of Japanese armour with energised swords made of adamantium, the Silver Samurai, Harada meanwhile realises what he is doing is wrong and allows Mariko to escape and frees Logan, the machine kills him. While Logan fights the Silver Samurai, losing his adamantium claws in the process, Yukio arrives and kills Viper, and inside the machine it is revealed to be Yashida, he faked his death, and he is able to slowly extract Logan's healing abilities from his body and regain his youth, but Yuko intervenes and kills Yashida with one of Logan's severed claws, Logan regenerates his bone claws to finish Yashida and throw him off the cliff. Logan in one final hallucination is finally able to let go of Jean Grey, Mariko becomes CEO of the Yashida Corporation and says goodbye to him, Yukio says she will stand by him as a bodyguard, returning to the United States two years later Logan is confronted with Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) and Professor Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart) who warn him of an oncoming danger to the mutant race, this of course will lead on to Days of Future Past. Jackman as always is tough and often gruff, the supporting cast members do well also, especially acrobatic and premonition seeing Fukushima and slinky female villain Khodchenkova, I can see what critics mean by the film being set in Japan having elements and near references to famous samurai and battle films, like Seven Samurai and Throne of Blood, the fight and chase sequences filled with fantastic special effects are definitely what keeps you gripped, it works much better than the previous Wolverine film and is a good warm up for the next X-Men romp, a most watchable action adventure. Good!"
"Dragonfyre137","4","1","2","20 May 2014"," Pretty much disappointing compared to the other X-Men universe films.
","If you're looking for another X-Men movie, you will be disappointed. Simply because this isn't a X-Men movie. It's a Wolverine-Movie.<br/><br/>But even then you might still get disappointed. Most of the movie is watching Wolverine get his bottom kicked by virtually everyone. The story didn't really convince me, it just seemed like the studio wanted to make quick money using the (over?)hyped iconic clawed mutant. Though there were some good plot-twists, I didn't have the feeling the story was rounded-up well and had any major point. Perhaps I'm missing something, but the lesson Logan seems to have learned during this movie could have been learned any other way and was in no correlation to the plot. Yes, I know Logan killed Jean in X-Men: Last Stand and sought solitude, but I still don't see why this movie was necessary.<br/><br/>Especially the post-credit scene actually showed how much out of context this movie was. The other X-Men universe movies show stories and events relevant to the overall plot and general understanding of the X-Men universe. Well, this one doesn't. You literally can not watch it and there wouldn't be any piece of relevant info you'd miss."

"AkelaLoneWolf","7","1","2","17 April 2014"," Not Bad (among Wolverine movies)
","The love for Hugh Jackman aside, this is easily the most profound Wolverine movie (profound in a Marvel comic sense, that is) that had been shot and produced. The film was quite well-balanced between action and character building; it depicted how the tragic hero battled mortality and his own dark demons whilst also slicing open the chests (and other body parts) of countless opponents with ease and grace. <br/><br/>The rhetoric: is it really good to get what one (believes) one craves and yearns for? I think the movie did a pretty job of illustrating that point. One drawback (spoilers warning!) - I dislike the way they tainted the friendship which lasted half a century. Another comment (spoilers again!) - I really don't feel too comfortable with the bone claws (which according to Marvel will be here to stay for a while yet) so am eagerly looking forward to the next X- Men movie."
"brando647","8","1","2","4 April 2014"," So Much Better Than X-MEN: ORIGINS
","After the utter disappointment of X-MEN ORIGINS, I was less than thrilled for a new solo adventure for Marvel's adamantium-clawed mutant. The shoddy plot, cable television level CG, and blatant abuse of Deadpool/Wade Wilson still leave a bad taste in my mouth five years after it was dumped into theaters. Fox hasn't got the greatest track record with its comic properties, with it's disappointments leaving a stronger impression than its successes. I never read the Chris Claremont/Frank Miller Japan story arc in the Wolverine comics, and the only James Mangold films I've ever seen were IDENTITY and WALK THE LINE (which were good, but didn't exactly imply he had the mindset for a comic book film). To simplify, I had no real draw to this film other than an ongoing hope that it just had to be better than the last Wolverine film. And, wow, it was. THE WOLVERINE is set a while after the events of THE LAST STAND. Logan is living off the grid, sleeping in the woods with only a radio and his nightmares to keep him company. He is found by a young Japanese woman, Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who insists he accompany her to Japan. There is a man from Logan's past on his deathbed and wishes to say goodbye to the mutant who once saved his life. The man, Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), offers Logan an opportunity for freedom from the pain of his immortal life. No longer would he have to live on as those he loves die around him. He turns him down, the old man dies, and that's when Logan's problems truly begin. He loses his healing abilities and is forced on the run to protect Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), while at the same time trying to discover who's behind it.<br/><br/>I actually really enjoyed THE WOLVERINE. It's a lot better than I anticipated, especially if you catch the unrated version that was released on home video. It's your fix for all the brutal Wolverine action our lives have been missing in the PG-13 X-MEN film universe. Without the rest of the X-Men around to bother him with those pesky morals, Logan gets to cut loose (no pun intended). He's not going up against a bunch of mutants this time with super strength or high endurance. He's (mostly) going against regular humans who crumple under the assault of his adamantium claws and animalistic rage. The loss of his mutant healing abilities add a nice touch to the film too. The biggest problem with a character such as Wolverine is that he's never truly in danger. There's not much that anyone can do to him that he wouldn't recover from and soon proceed to eviscerate them. Without his healing abilities, he's finally at risk, and so is Mariko. Mariko's being hunted by the Yakuza following her grandfather's death and Logan makes it his mission to protect her. This leads to some nice character moments as Logan allows himself to get close to someone for the first real time since the death of Jean Grey, a death that continues to haunt him. THE WOLVERINE is just as much a character piece as it is a comic book/action film. We still get loads of Wolverine action but it's interspersed with chances to develop his character in regards to his budding romance with Mariko and his friendship with the beautiful Yukio. Rila Fukushima is probably my favorite part of the entire film. Her character Yukio is an exotic beauty and a masterful fighter in both hand-to-hand combat and katanas. Plus, she's a mutant because it was necessary for some interesting plot foreshadowing (and literally nothing else).<br/><br/>THE WOLVERINE is not without it's flaws though. The movie drags on a little in the midsection when the bulk of the character development is placed. I didn't mind it too much but it was enough of a lull that my buddy actually fell asleep in the theater for a few minutes at that point. Honestly, it's not that bothersome. I was more turned off by the character of Viper. It just wouldn't be an X-Men film if there wasn't at least one character shoe-horned in to fill out the mutant quota. Oh yeah, she's a mutant in the movie too (while he character in the comics wasn't) and, as I understand it, she had nothing to do with the Japanese story arc. She's just here because they wanted a mid-level mutant villain. I don't care much for her inclusion in the movie and Svetlana Khodchenkova doesn't do much but chew scenery, giving no real depth other than being evil. Wasteful.<br/><br/>I love that the majority of the movie is a more toned down, character-centric film that the other comic movies out there but it all devolves into the usual sci- fi/fantasy/action stuff. Big baddie, lot's of fighting, epic conclusionall that stuff. Also, I've got to say I saw all the major plot points coming a mile away. I knew who was behind most the evil-doings just from having seen the trailers. Still, it wasn't enough to taint the experience. I was pleasantly surprised by THE WOLVERINE and I forgive Fox for the mess that was X-MEN ORIGINS. While I wouldn't rank it up there with my favorite comic book movies, it was still a great entry in the X-Men cinematic universe and proof that Logan/Hugh Jackman are still going strong."

","Warning: spoiler alerts.<br/><br/>Its already sixth the Wolverine role for Hugh Jackman. But I will not complain. He is still perfect and always give everything in his role. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) was very disappointing. The movie got too much the characters and the special effects took the lead and the story suffered a lot. Also the character were much more tamed than Bryan Singers movies. It also proposed the girls too much with Jackman's shirtless body and typical Hollywood explosions. Wolverine's ""animal side were minimal"".<br/><br/>The Wolverine based on the comic book created by Frank Miller and Chris Claremont. In the story Logan travel to the Japan to learn from samurai's. The film is and independent sequel to X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). For the paper it would have been a very bad idea but the script is much better than in X3 movie. Jean Grey appears to Logan's mind every night to him and Logan doesn't want forget her.<br/><br/>The hero lives in Alaska. Suddenly he got invitation to the Japan to meet an old friend. Logan saved him a long time ago. Logan travels to the Japan to say goodbyes. The journey went to unfriendly and Logan will face his demons again and chance to become mortal.<br/><br/>The crew has learned a lot from the first Wolverine solo movie. This time there are not too much mutants and this time the hero itself is central of the story. Hugh Jacman shines again in the leading role. His muscles are bigger than ever. The cast is wonderful and not well-known but it does not bothered at all.<br/><br/>The special effects looked cool and they kept these minimal. There are not much action scenes but when the action starts these looks good. Especially fight on the bullet train looked damn cool. Unfortunately in the end of the movie the ideas started reminded too much typical action movie. Maybe they didn't knew what they wanted. The final fight felt rushed. It was very disappointment. Next time something new, please.<br/><br/>James Mangold did a fantastic job as the director and hopefully he continue in the sequels. Overall The Wolverine is enjoyable and one of the best superhero movies."

","I liked this movie a lot. It was slick, intense, good action, good acting all around, well directed and one has to respect the decorum of Mr. Jackman. He was in amazing shape for this movie, his chest and abs were insane, and one has to respect that transformation. That's a lot of work physically, mentally and spiritually all around. I liked where the story went, I thought it was the best one out of the X-men series and the last Wolverine movie.<br/><br/>You can never go wrong with Samurai's and pretty Asian women either who can kick some butt. James Mangold is a fantastic director and I can just imagine he was fighting the producers to keep that ending out of the movie, I won't say the ending, but it was an ending that took away from the movie and I can imagine Mr. Mangold was furious for having to keep it in there.

","What they did to me, what I am, can't be undone.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that ""The X-Men"" were never my favorite superheroes, this film could still fascinate me. The script wasn't entirely accurate and you ended up with a huge number of questions in some situations. It's a long time ago I've watched the original X-Men movie. And ""The Wolverine"" is the most imaginative character off course. It's therefore normal there are apparently a number of spin-offs about him. By choosing Japan as the location, the interference by the Yakuza was a logical consequence. The positive result is that you sometimes get flashy and highly entertaining action moments, with a mix of ""Martial Art"" and the cutting and slicing actions of ""The Wolverine"" as an excellent combination, presenting exciting movie moments. Unfortunately, these moments are extremely scarce. What a shame!. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is magnificent as ""The Wolverine"". A legendary role that fits him like a glove. Since there are no other fellow mutants, he has the difficult task to carry the whole film. He does, but unfortunately it is not enough to make it a real epic super-hero story. There's also the fact that the movie focuses on the personal emotional state of Wolverine and the process of dealing with the death of Jean Grey, his beloved. Apparently he is guilty for her death. Cause of the lack of any prior knowledge of the entire X -Men saga, those flashbacks were completely useless to me. Further, the role played by Rila Fukushima (Never heard of her before) as Yokio was a sublime addition to the main character. Her oddly shaped face made ​​her look like a bizarre partner. But it's the action she shows, with her ​​flashy moves, which made it a pleasant movie to watch. Tao Okamoto as Mariko was necessary for the overall picture, but otherwise I thought it was a kind of a pathetic performance. Especially the amorous part I didn't like although it probably was mandatory to use. <br/><br/>The story on its own was not very original, and as mentioned earlier, at some times it didn't make much sense to me. In a nutshell, you can summarize it as follows: Yashida, a Japanese industrial magnate is being rescued by Logan during the bombing of Nagasaki. Yashida is eternally grateful for that and invites him to japan. He wants to thank him just one more time before he pasts away. To redeem Logan from his eternal suffering and life, Yashida suggests to give that gift to himself so he can enjoy eternal life. Logan refuses and the assistant of Yashida (who is also a mutant apparently) implants a type of pacemaker in his heart. His self-healing powers gradually disappear and he becomes vulnerable. <br/><br/>Eventually there remain a few unexplained questions . Wasn't it the case that those claws of Logan couldn't be destroyed ? After drilling in the knuckles of Logan the self-healing forces seep into Yashida , who also looks visibly younger after that. Yet only moments later he dies from a simple stab wound. Weird ! From where did Viper come? What purpose did she have in mind ? She is a kind of mutant that knows a lot about different poison and shows a snake tongue as it suits her. Wouldn't it make more sense that she reduces Logan's powers, by implanting poison in his heart, instead of a futuristic type of parasite. And how the hell did she get that thing in there ? Did that intense french kiss help her getting it in there ? What was the skin replacement all about ? The do-it-yourself heart surgery Logan did, was a bit excessive ! How the hell did he get through his ribs? The high-speed chase on the train, even though you're a superhero, breaks with all the laws of physics. And my biggest question was : If Yashida really wanted to take over those powers, why take the risk to reduce Logan's powers so there could be a possibility he died ? He could forget about that eternal life if that happened ! <br/><br/>In the end it's just another superhero movie in which the superhero rather looks like a sad,isolated individual whose superpowers slowly diminish. You have to be patient to see some action until the funeral of Yashida. But when that moment arrives, you're glued to your screen. Unfortunately that feeling doesn't really come back and you can only look at a kind of tourist guide of Japan in which all aspects of the country are reviewed. The end is unbelievable and sometimes downright ridiculous. It's entertainment but not at an exceptional level.<br/><br/>Not quite so super! <br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"
"thojojack","5","1","2","29 January 2014"," Drowning the appetite for a good Wolverine movie
","What I liked about this movie:<br/><br/>The first half of the movie. Seeing Hugh Jackman in another great performance even though he and Rila Fukushima got the only authentic roles. A pretty girl in a romantic story ... which on the other hand ruined the thing with the Japanese honor through her actions. Some good fight scenes as you would expect from any action movie.<br/><br/>What I did not like about this movie: <br/><br/>Many parts of the second half of the movie. This movie really confused me and made me sad. It was not a Marvel movie as I have seen them lately, e.g. The Avengers, Iron Man 3, etc. What I liked most about the recent Marvel productions was that they did not take themselves seriously. The entertaining comedy factor was very high, while this was played seriously like death. This way continues the way X-Men movies were made, but considering that a big part of Marvel fans are adults between 20 and 40, I think the style should be adapted and grow up as the audience does (did). The main plot - personal problems of the main character - as well as the 'technology' of the final enemy are pretty much the same as in Iron Man 3 - an unexpected lack of creativity that was very disappointing. And this Legolas guy was the exact copy of Hawkeye from The Avengers, save that this one was played badly whenever he had to open his mouth. The course of events seemed to me like a shuffled draw from a deck of action/story-of-any-kind scenes. The characters talk about Japanese honor but they rather present us the attitude of Charlie Sheen in Two and a Half Men. The clichés of the Wolverine are placed in a wrong fashion. They try to make you laugh, but they do not. I need to underline that the bad guys have no motivation and do not take much part in the story. This could be a follow-up to Rambo taking into account the characters' illogical decisions while slaughtering their way to whatever they want to accomplish.<br/><br/>I loved the first Wolverine movie and watching this is not a waste of time, so I give it a 5, but set your expectations low to enjoy. <br/><br/>You can do better, Marvel!"
"MaximumMadness","7","1","2","21 December 2013"," Solid, ferocious fun, ""The Wolverine"" is a well-made and exciting adventure for the titular hero, that runs laps around the underwhelming prior solo-film.
","It's fairly interesting going back and watching the thus-far six entries in 20th Century Fox's ""X-Men"" film franchise. From a solid start with Bryan Singer's excellent first two films, through the plunge into mediocrity with Brett Ratner's shockingly underwhelming third entry and the subsequent (and almost equally as underwhelming) fourth entry, which also focused on a solo-adventure of ""Wolverine."" Then there was a glimmer of hope with the extremely strong and very well-made ""X-Men: First Class"", which redeemed the series in a big, bad way. It lived up to Singer's first two installments (which isn't surprising, as Singer was a producer and co-writer after his 2-film absence), and gave new hope for the series.<br/><br/>And it is nice to see that this revitalization of the series continues in this newest entry, a solo-film for everyone's favorite clawed antihero- ""The Wolverine."" While it may not quite live up to ""First Classes"" first-class storytelling and direction, this entry in the franchise is still another step in the right direction, giving us a solid storyline, great visual direction, and a stronger depiction of the character than in his prior solo-effort.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman returns as Logan/Wolverine, some time after the death of his beloved Jean (Famke Janssen, who returns in several dream-like sequences) in ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" He now lives as a hermit in the Yukon, living off of the land and away from civilization as much as he can. However, he is soon located by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), and taken to Tokyo, Japan to meet with Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), whom he had saved from the Nagasaki nuclear blast in WWII. However, after a deadly series of events occurs, Yashida dies and Logan is forced to protect his granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto) from various forces, all while discovering that something, or someone, has somehow been able to suppress his healing capabilities, making him mortal and weak for the first time.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Jackman is as (for lack of a better description) awesome as ever as good-old Wolverine, but he is also able to pull off some great dramatic moments as well. It's a great, compelling performance. Janssen is very decent in her small role, as a figment of Logan's imagination, reminding him of all he's lost. Rila Fukushima is a lot of fun as the mutant Yukio, as is Tao Okamoto as Mariko, whom Logan is sworn to protect. And Haruhiko Yamanouchi is very interesting in his limited role as Yashida. And all of the actors portraying secondary characters are equally solid as the lead cast.<br/><br/>James Mangold's direction is top notch. I'm only familiar with some of his prior work (mainly in the excellent ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""Identity""), but here, he is able to adapt to the almost Sci-Fi tone and the rampant action with ease, conveying just the right tone and style to tell this story correctly. I also highly admired his fantastic visual choices, and choice in shot and composition. The direction was top-notch, for sure. <br/><br/>Scott Frank and Mark Bomback's script is also a lot of fun. It's tightly paced, well-constructed, and gives just the right balance between action, development and even a little dark humor here and there. Although I will admit it is far from a perfect script. Some scenes are pure cheese (including, sadly, many of Janssen's scenes as Jean Gray), and the storyline itself is unfortunately nothing to write home about. It's a bit basic and cliché. And it really is what holds this film back from getting a higher score. It's not a bad script. But it's just not quite as good as it could have been.<br/><br/>The rest of the production is very admirable, though. Costume and set design is fantastic. The visual effects are awe-inspiring and put the cheap-looking crap from Wolverine's last solo-film to shame. And the music by Marco Beltrami, while not one of his finest scores, is still a lot of fun, and it compliments the words and images on screen very well.<br/><br/>This is thankfully another step forward for the ""X-Men"" film series. And it is thankfully (and finally) a film the likes of which Wolverine deserves. It may not be perfect, but it's fast, ferocious fun, and I think fans of the character will dig it.<br/><br/>""The Wolverine"" gets a good 7 out of 10 from me."
"vidarium","5","1","2","21 December 2013"," Why bother?
","The Wolverine is a competent movie but not special in any way. The acting is okay. The special effects are okay. The story is okay. Since our time is limited, is that enough?<br/><br/>You'll be entertained but what will you remember after a week? Probably not much. The plot isn't especially creative (no spoilers). The twists are somewhat predictable. At times you might think you're watching Pacific Rim, a Transformers movie or even The Matrix.

If the use of CGI and effects were wisely chosen and used to further the plot itself. If the movie used its own ideas and is well structured. If an adventure film truly thrills and delivers intrigue. And finally, if the actors, cinematographers, and producers were able to flow with the director's vision and deliver using their own particular craft.<br/><br/>That being said, The Wolverine works on all those levels."

","By now even non-Marvel comics devotees know the persona of The Wolverine, primarily because he has been recreated by actor Hugh Jackman six times (and if you pay attention to the film's ending it seems there will be more). Writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank have elected to place the action of this version in Japan – both in the time of the Atomic Bombing of Nagasaki and the present. Much of the reason this version works well is due to the fact that the action is all in the beauty of Japan of today – not only the scenery but also the symbols and traditions. Director James Mangold gives this version of Wolverine adventure a hefty dose of compassion and human feeling and that adds significantly.<br/><br/>According to the short synopsis form 20th Century Fox, 'In modern day Japan, Wolverine is out of his depth in an unknown world as he faces his ultimate nemesis in a life-or-death battle that will leave him forever changed. Vulnerable for the first time and pushed to his physical and emotional limits, he confronts not only lethal samurai steel but also his inner struggle against his own immortality, emerging more powerful than we have ever seen him before.' That states it well. Add to that description the many fights and magic that occur before our eyes and the content is complete.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is in buff form as a very tender Wolverine (Logan) this time around (flashbacks to his loss of his love, Famke Janssen, add spice). Others who make solid appearances include Tao Okamoto as the important Mariko, Rila Fukushima as Logan's sidekick, Svetlana Khochenkova as the evil Viper, Hiroyuki Sanada as a credible Shingen, and Ken Yamamura and Haruhiko Yamanouchi sharing the role of Yashida.<br/><br/>A bit on the long side, the film provides the expected visual entertainment, and this time there is a bit more humanity infused as well.

","The beginning and end were good, but the rest of the movie was horrible. Wolverine got his rear end kicked the whole movie. If I wanted to watch a drama, I would have rented one. W is supposed to be a tough super hero that dominates his enemies, not some drama queen with a broken nail. At least the end gave notion to a sequel, which better be on an action film or I am done with W. Waste of money and time. What where the creators thinking? <br/><br/>Wolverine couldn't fight worth a darn, gets his blades cut off, he might as well been a mortal. Maybe that was the point, but it made me think worse of him not better. I was hoping that the final fight was going to make up for the lack of good action, but all it did was annoy me. This movie was a complete let down and I wouldn't waist any money to watch it. Wait until it airs on HBO you can get it for a Dollar on Red Box before you watch whatever comes after."
"chris-j-stanton","5","1","2","29 November 2013"," Reboot please
","The writers of the two Wolverine movies have repeated what the writers of the Wolverine comics succeeded in doing - messing with Wolverine's powers and back-story so much that loyal fans such as myself ended up walking away from the comics and movies. <br/><br/>Wolverine was my favourite comic book character as a kid growing up (I'm now almost 40 years old). I still have a huge pile of the comics. <br/><br/>Originally, Wolverine never had bone claws. He had a healing factor and animal-like senses, but no bone claws. The Weapon X project gave him his skeleton and claws, turning him into the ultimate indestructible super soldier. <br/><br/>I started losing interest and stopped collecting the comics when the comics started messing with Wolvie's powers and back story. For 20 years the comic book writers left Wolvie's powers constant (i.e. adamantium skeleton and claws) and most of his history a mystery, AND IT SHOULD OF STAYED THIS WAY. I stopped collecting at issue 100 when they didn't give Wolverine back his adamantium. <br/><br/>Then, Wolverine movie 1 comes out and spells out scene by scene a stupid back story that had nothing to do with the original comics. No mystique, no mystery - the writers spoon fed a stupid story of adamantium bullets and a bone clawed child to the audience. <br/><br/>Now, Wolverine 2 is even more disappointing. For most of this movie, it was pretty good. Then the climatic end comes in which Wolvie has his ADAMANTIUM CLAWS SNAPPED OFF. Are you kidding writers? Adamantium is INDESTRUCTIBLE. The whole point of ADAMANTIUM CLAWS IS THEY CAN'T BE BROKEN. Adamantium is INDESTRUCTIBLE. You can't shoot adamantium bullets through it. And you can't use adamantium to cut adamantium, otherwise it wouldn't be INDESTRUCTIBLE would it???<br/><br/>The whole point of adamantium claws is THEY CAN'T BE BROKEN.<br/><br/>Way to go script writers. When you run out of ideas for an interesting story, mess with the laws of the Marvel universe and destroy a much loved character. <br/><br/>Thankfully I only paid $1 at the DVD shop to rent this movie. <br/><br/>REBOOT PLEASE."
"kenobi7","10","2","7","31 August 2013"," Not as good as other superhero films of the year, but miles better than the first three X-Men films.
","The X-Men films have always been kind of hit-or-miss, in my opinion. The first 2 installments are both really good (X2 the best out of the pair), but they seem underwhelming to me in a way, being a fan that watched other superhero films first, ones that were more recent and had more of a fanbase. As any fan knows, X3 failed to impress in almost every respect, only delivering fully action-wise and with a certain after- credits scene. First Class is definitely the best of the bunch, even though it does get fairly juvenile at times with the younger mutants' story lines. Origins was a spin-off film that still didn't reveal anything new about the character, and was a convoluted mess because of it, despite some great action scenes. And they have all done their part to confuse fans with the continuity errors and plot holes. However, even after all this, they are still very well done. They have some of the best casts ever assembled, and boast top-shelf special effects. This particular film is an excellent example of that. Jackman returns to the role that made him famous among American audiences, sharing the screen with a mostly foreign cast that still manages to hold its own. It is an adaptation of the comics' Japan Saga, but holds several surprises due to some worthwhile liberties taken. Logan finds himself in a dark place after the events of X3. He is basically just a wanderer, much like he was before the events of X1. He is asked to return to Japan as part of a favor for a man whose life he saved during World War II. Once he gets there, nothing proves to be as it seems. The country holds many enemies and a few friends for him, and he might just not come out of it alive. I say that with absolute seriousness. Due to a certain critical plot point, Wolverine might just lose what makes him a mutant and not be able to get it back. There is action, suspense, and tragedy aplenty. Jackman gives a terrific performance, finally being able to deliver on what Origins fell far short of doing - really figuring out the Wolverine character, emotionally, mentally, and physically. The only problem I had with the film is that the story required a certain amount of filling stuff in for myself, and some stuff that I had to ask others about afterwards. But other than that, it proved to be a great film, a great superhero movie, and a great performance by Jackman and his foreign co-stars."
"eatfirst","6","2","7","31 July 2013"," Western genre meets Eastern setting for a fresh take on a familiar hero.
","Hugh Jackman and Walk The Line director James Mangold make a modest... ahem... stab at rescuing The Wolverine from bloated too-many-mutants boredom with this stand-alone adventure that owes more to Clint Eastwood's man with no name than it does to the Stan Lee back-catalogue.<br/><br/>Logan, once again alone and wandering the wilderness, is summoned to Japan by a man from his distant past and becomes caught up in a power struggle between the dynastic family of a powerful corporation, Yakuza gangsters, and some shadowy ninjas (are there any other type?).<br/><br/>On the plus side, for at least two thirds of the movie this keeps The Wolverine grounded amongst real people; vulnerable, disorientated, and in grimly emotional turmoil. Hugh Jackman doesn't have to work very hard to pull this off, his powerful presence and comfortable familiarity with the role playing to the strengths of a tale that commendably cuts free of mutant hi-jinks for most of its running time, and indulges in some fairly obvious, but pleasingly underplayed culture-clash elements inherent in this setting.<br/><br/>It's kind of a shame then that the film takes a jarring turn into the third act, feeling duty bound to deliver some big FX silliness. The tonal wrench feels deeply uncomfortable and also leaves great gaping holes in the arcs of previously intriguing characters. <br/><br/>Not the disaster of his previous solo outing. There is good work in the brooding western-influenced tale and for the most part things coast along nicely on Jackman's effortless charisma. If only they could have held their storytelling nerve through to the end."
"ivan-krolo0424","9","2","7","28 July 2013"," The best character study CBM since Batman Begins
","The Wolverine is a very down to earth film that offers us a great look at who Wolverine is, whats it like to be him and how he can find purpose in a life full of tragedy and constant struggle. It really shows you what its like to be a man like Logan, what are the advantages, what are the disadvantages and how can you find purpose in life that can never truly end but most importantly it makes us care about Wolverine for the first time on the big screen.The action scenes are expertly shot and the fighting choreography is among the best I've seen all year (the train fight and the duel between Shingen & Wolverine are particularly amazing). All the performances are great with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine being the one that really steals the show and all around its a great film held back by some small problems such as some things being poorly explained and the romance having too many cliché glancing moments between Logan and Mariko to beat us over the head that these two will have a romance."
"brionesb","8","2","7","28 July 2013"," A Much Better Wolverine Story Than The Original!
","Like me, if you saw the original Wolverine movie, you probably came away very disappointed with how they unraveled a little bit about his past as well as his origins. In every possible way, the original movie was underwhelming and felt much like an exercise in futility. The story was bland, the plot gave you a little bit to care about while at the same time leaving you wondering if there was really a point to everything and it all just felt nobody was interested in giving the fans the Wolverine movie/story they wanted.<br/><br/>Enter the 2nd movie, The Wolverine, and many of the problems have been rectified. This time around we catch up to Logan(aka Wolverine) hiding out in the mountains and just trying to pass the time away in what's become a very meaningless and empty life. Logan's days are filled with futility and recurring nightmares of the death of Jean Grey which slowly cause him to question his own existence. Because the poor guy is basically immortal & has an incredible healing factor, the loss of his love in Jean Grey haunts him and leaves him pining for the cold embrace of death.<br/><br/>This is where the story's gravity comes from, which is truly wonderful considering that the character cannot die easily if at all. If you are even a little bit familiar with the Wolverine character, you'll know that he's literally lived & survived through a great many events that would have finished any other man thousands of times over. Here however, this facet is used to drive a very heartwarming & gripping story of love and loss and how one man comes to terms with it.<br/><br/>It all starts out in WWII with the Japanese soldiers in Hiroshima standing guard. As we all know, at this period of time Japan was at war with the US and was about to be decimated for the attack that occurred at Pearl Harbor. We enter this movie, shortly before the bombs are dropped and with Logan saving one Japanese soldier who eternally becomes grateful for this sacrificial act of bravery. The movie then continues on and shows us Logan living back in the US and laying low while experiencing recurring nightmares which drive him to the edge of insanity until one day he is tracked to a bar by a Japanese woman who has been sent to find him and bring him back to Japan.<br/><br/>Once back in Japan, Logan discovers that the Japanese soldier whose life he saved in WWII is still alive but barely. It is here that we find out that the old man wanted Logan because of his healing abilities and supposed immortality, which is why he was brought to Japan in the first place. To make this review as spoiler-free as possible, it then continues on with Logan finding out the truth behind all of the circumstances that brought him to Japan and he ultimately finds meaning in his life once again and comes to appreciate the mutant gift that he has been born with.<br/><br/>As was mentioned earlier, this movie elegantly handles the story of Logan/Wolverine coming to grips with his immortality and ability to outlive practically everyone in his life. The story unfolds very well and at a pace that seems appropriate, not being too slow or too quick at any point. Although the movie is just over 2 hours in length, it feels like the pace is just right and enough time is spent giving us an opportunity to relate & emote with Logan/Wolverine. The action isn't as spectacular as Marvel's other summer 2013 blockbuster, Iron Man 3, however it's still pretty intense and punctuates the story very well.<br/><br/>All in all, this is definitively the best Wolverine/X-Men story that has been told to date aside from X-Men: First Class. It also does a good job of quasi-rebooting the X-Men franchise which builds up to the 2014 X-Men sequel - Days Of Future Past. I'm glad that they got this movie & story right with this, otherwise I would've said it's time to put the franchises on hiatus and focus on other Marvel franchises instead. This movie however proves that like Wolverine, the character and the X-Men franchise has a lot of life left in it!"
"CowherPowerForever","7","2","7","26 July 2013"," Too much hype. Disappointed
","After a wait of more than four years following what many considered to be a average movie at best we get The Wolverine. X-Men Origins: Wolverine was attacked by most people and caused a big backlash that was probably the cause of this film being pushed back for four years. I'll admit I was not one who hated or tore apart Origins. I enjoyed that film. This film however not so much.<br/><br/>The biggest complaint I have is with the story. Mark Bomback and Scott Frank both wrote this film. The same people who brought us Total Recall(remake) and Live Free or Die Hard. So the story being a bit overly boring shouldn't have surprised me but it did. Often times films fail to keep your interest for a run time such as this film has which is just about two hours. The Wolverine starts out nicely with a good story and it seems like it will go in a good direction. Sadly this film often slows for a good period of time and takes awhile to pick back up. The action scenes were amazing however but the lack of interesting story diminishes that aspect since after each amazing action scene we are stuck with boring and overly long dialogue.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold is truly one of my favorite directors. He has brought us such films such as Cop Land, Identity, Walk the Line, and 3:10 to Yuma. The directing in this film is actually very good. Mangold knows how to direct a high flying action scene as he has been doing that for so many years now. No worries about a shaky cam here during the big action scenes which adds a lot to the film. There are some problems with this film however the directing from James Mangold is not one of them.<br/><br/>The acting comprised with mostly foreign actors throughout the film is actually very good. Supporting actors and actress like Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, Brain Tee, and Hal Yamanouchi all work together very well as a family in this film. The chemistry is there and you can tell. Then there is Svetlana Khodchenkova who plays the role of Viper. She comes off as completely out of place and doesn't fit in the role of all. Yet another downside to the film. Hugh Jackman however puts in another great performance as The Wolverine. From the start Jackman has dominated this role and after fourteen years he still plays the role with the same force and same energy.<br/><br/>Overall this film is just above average. There is one lone item that truly saves this film and that scene comes about a minute into the credits. I'm not going to spoil it however make sure you stick around to see it. The scene is amazing and sadly for this film it is the best scene of the movie. Overall I would give this movie a 6.5/10"
"aka_sabretooth","2","2","8","28 July 2013"," ""I am the best at what I..."" bang! (ouch!) bang! (ouch!) BANG!! (OUCH!!)
","This is a movie with Hugh Jackman showcasing a beard and metal claws, and some Japanese dudes doing stuff, and there is also a blonde in a sexy outfit. Jackman gets shot at a lot, and even at point blank: in the leg, in the torso, in the shoulder, everywhere. But this is no western, really. There is some action here, there are scenes in which you wonder what is going on, and you don't care a lot about what's gonna happen next because you don't understand what is really going on. Then you pretend you understand, or you leave the cinema. I stayed, as my son was kinda entertained. Then he asked me what the hell was going on. ""Whatever"", I answered.<br/><br/>If you are new to the ""Marvel-mutants-go-to-the-movies"" hype, don't bother, you can certainly skip this: I don't think you will find a lot of entertainment value here. It feels quite disjointed, with bizarre and outlandish touches so typical of... well, not sure really of what, but possibly a melange of the worst examples from the ""Marvel-mutants-go-to-the-movies"" hype. Yep, it's all here. Don't listen to what the actors and ""creators"" in this movie are saying, or better don't take them too seriously.<br/><br/>If you are not new to Marvel mutant movies and are familiar with the title character, well, you can also certainly skip this, err..., ""film"". <br/><br/>In the comics, there are some memorable Wolverine stories, there are good Wolverine stories, there are bad, and then there are those which you feel you could give the stuff you just read some real purpose by wiping your rear end with the paper. And yes, that's exactly how I felt during and after watching it. I even wondered how would you do that with film.<br/><br/>I entertained a lot of other meditations during the movie. For example, my mind kept going back to Ridley Scott's Prometheus, once and once again, which, come to think of, it is a recent movie example of bad (Real Bad) science fiction and grotesque, bizarre imagery, in a disjointed story, about which you don't care a blimey about anything. Also, both Prometheus and this one have kind of odd things happening to heads -yes, ""heads"", and I am seriously trying not to spoil here the bizarre twists involving ""heads"" in both movies that still manage to stick to the retina after a while.<br/><br/>Oh, what the hell, I'll spoil it. In Prometheus, a disembodied head gets a metal probe manually punched in its skull, right behind the ear, and when given electricity through the probe the head starts moving and screaming, and then it explodes -that's Prometheus to me. Here in The Wolverine, a head (still fixed to its living body however) gets a half a piece of adamantium claw punched in, yes, literally, and it still manages to go on talking and acting. So... as I said, ""whatever"". This is what sci fi can get you sometimes.<br/><br/>And if you are still having second thoughts: forget it. Nobody is the best at anything in this movie.<br/><br/>(Snikt!)"

It would never have to suffer through the rest of this film. I wanted to like this film, I have on some level enjoyed all that went before it. So why did they decide to have a plot that had more holes in it than the bears fur.<br/><br/>I was moved by the bears look of anguish as it implored Wolverine to end its life. I felt that the bear with so much to live for had obviously read the script and knew this was the time to get out of this cinematic life.<br/><br/>So in summary, if you want to make the bears sacrifice mean something, avoid this film."

","How many times have we seen that one cliché movie ? Well, actually too many to remember, and this particular movie will go down as another one of those movies which will ultimately be forgotten. You expect more from not only Jackman but also from the brand Wolverine. And it pains me to say that the movie which starts of a little slower than its predecessor, although in a semblance more serious than ever before, makes you believe that you're in for a royal treat, turns into a very similar cat and mouse chase story in a matter of 20 minutes! Believe me when I say, you can predict everything that is going to happen after a certain point in the movie(And that point comes really early too but perhaps the most shocking part was that my predictions were absolutely spot on). If you just want to see Jackman act as wolverine like he usually does, raging on like wild, killing people etc, and you're not bored with this regiment then you can go watch it, but if you're looking for something more, something like a good intriguing story that captures your thought process and provides you with thrills (not just visual but mental as well) you were looking for in the very first place then you'd better avoid it, watch it on TV or something when you've got a lot of time to kill."

","The Wolverine is another pointless standalone sequel with an all too familiar, straightforward and predictable plot.The Wolverine is slightly better compared to X-Men Origins: Wolverine in terms of plot but suffers by a series of unrealistic plot contrivances.Most of the supporting characters are given little or no character development throughout the film, they're just simply there for the sake of story progression.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine, he showed his dedication ('Wolverine gym workout') and delivered his best portrayal of the character throughout the X-Men series. The problems lies on the script and the character himself. Although the film is loosely based on the 1982 Wolverine comic set in Japan, but is he a compelling character enough to earn 2 spin-offs in the franchise? The film never takes time to explore the temporary physical vulnerability experienced by Logan...how he feels and deals with the sudden change of his immortality. There's no solid motive or reason why Logan need to stay or remain in Japan. He can choose to leave anytime he wants during the earlier stages of the film, instead he chose to stay to protect someone he barely even know or care about. Furthermore, the relationship between Mariko and Logan feels forced and doesn't seem credible or real, they just barely know each other and the lack of on-screen chemistry between the lead actors makes it even worst.The film briefly mentioned about family honour, respect and love, but one would question about Mariko's action near the end of the 3rd act of the film.<br/><br/>The action scenes didn't offer anything new (most of them done before by previous X-Men movies) and I'm probably one of the few who doesn't find the 300mph bullet train fight scene exhilarating or cool at all.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film seems to be the mid-credit scene that might excite a lot of X-Men fans, foreshadowing what is going to happen for the next X-Men movie - Days of Future Past.A lot of questions raised as to why and how it happened, a good scene to pique the audience interest about what to come next year.<br/><br/>Recent superhero movies of the decade such as The Avengers and The Dark Knight Trilogy have showed us that superhero films can be something more...and what The Wolverine delivers simply isn't enough anymore. In my opinion, X-Men: First Class is still the best (in terms of character development, story flow, acting, plot) in the X-Men film series."

But her (Svetlana Khodchenkova) hair is not green, it's blonde. I don't known if the marvel hardcore fans would make a fuss about that. In addition she has a mutant power, that I didn't know, I thought she was more like a H.Y.D.R.A. super soldier.<br/><br/>I want to discuss about the silver samurai, but let's not slip to spoilers.<br/><br/>Putting all of that aside, there are two main reasons to like this film, that is Yukio and Mariko. Yukio (Rila Fukushima) is a red head Japanese body guard with spear and sword fighting skills and dresses like a Harajuku girl. Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is the princess in the story that besides being very pretty, has quite good fighting skills. Her weapon is a knife. <br/><br/>And there you have it. Wolverine fighting his way through japan between two delightful girls, slashing countless samurais.<br/><br/>I give it 8/10 for being a film that is liked for a particular reason."

Fortunately, all of the actor here acts acceptably although most of them are Japanese and not well known at Hollywood industry. Some action sequences are still stunning though especially the scene when Wolverine fights on fast train. Overall 'The Wolverine' is still fun as summer entertainment. James Mangold as director has been brave to shot and bring Wolverine story at Japan which rarely happens in blockbuster movie. But it's too shame this movie lost in slow plot, repeatable and overlong storyline that sometimes make audience feels bored.

"bryank-04844","5","1","3","23 August 2015"," While 'The Wolverine' is still not a solid film, it's a step in the right direction.
","This second installment in a supposed Wolverine trilogy is certainly a step in the right direction. Despite 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' being a terrible mess of a film on all levels, it managed to muster almost $400 million worldwide. With James Mangold at the helm this time, we finally have a decent attempt at furthering one of the most beloved mutant heroes in comic book history.<br/><br/>Writers Scott Frank and Mark Bomback take their cues from Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's comic book story arc from the early '80s to give us a modern-day take on the character. Dealing with severe depression about his immortality, Logan takes on the Yakuza and corporate corruption in Japan. While it's not the norm for a comic book film, Mangold pushes things in the right direction, until an anticlimactic fight scene that falls apart on every single level.<br/><br/>We first see Logan (Hugh Jackman) a bit of time after the separation of the mutant squad in the horrible 'X-Men: The Last Stand'. Logan has let himself go. He lives in the forest on a pile of rocks, and has a beard that could compete with Grizzly Adams. His only friend is a giant Kodiak bear. Throughout the movie, Logan is haunted by corny dream sequences about his late love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who Logan was forced to kill some time ago. For some reason, Janssen's wardrobe consists only of white lingerie.<br/><br/>As we learn in a flashback, Logan saved a young Japanese soldier from a nuclear bomb, and the two have stayed distant friends for many years. When Japanese hipster Yukio (Rila Fukushima) shows up in the present day to inform Logan that his long-time friend, now a powerful business tycoon known as Lord Yashida, is knocking on death's door and wants to say his final goodbye, Logan follows her to Japan, where things get a bit hairy. After Yashida's death, events spiral out of control. Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is a target of the violent Yakuza, seemingly led by Mariko's father (Hiroyuki Sanada). She and Logan go on the run from assassins, ninjas and the mutant villain Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), who dresses in green and kills her victims with a venomous kiss (and is eerily similar to Batman's enemy Poison Ivy). This all leads to a climactic battle where Logan must defeat the Silver Samurai.<br/><br/>Other than a fun and silly scene on top of a 300 mph train, most of the action takes place on the ground with very little CGI, if at all. The martial arts fighting is spot-on and fun to watch. Mangold does a good job capturing the Japanese culture and cinema.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman once again owns the Wolverine role. We see him struggle with his personal demons and physical ailments, as well as take on seemingly unstoppable villains with this constraint.<br/><br/>The 3D conversion does little to impress, although the wide shots of a snowy Japan add some good depth.<br/><br/>While 'The Wolverine' is still not a solid film, it's a step in the right direction. Some of the pacing is a little slow, and some elements of silly comic-book humor feel out of place. An end-credit sequence will blow your mind and might make you jump out of your seat and yell ""YES!""<br/><br/>I figure that fans of the story and Wolverine will venture out to see this bloodless PG-13 super-hero movie, but the rest of us might as well just wait for the upcoming 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'."

"ericrnolan","7","1","3","29 May 2015"," Wolverine does not practice safe sex.
","Think about it. He suffers from chronic nightmares, awakens in a panic attack, and then gets all stabbity-stabbity towards whichever woman happens to be closest to his bed. We saw this in ""The X-Men"" (2000), but thankfully Rogue's plot convenient powers saved her. No mention is made of this to Mariko in ""The Wolverine"" (2013). Should he be  kinda sorta responsible for informing any women he spends the night with about his sleep disorder?<br/><br/>Anyway,I didn't despise this movie the way so many others did, but my response was somewhat tepid for a lifelong fan of the character.<br/><br/>I understand what the filmmakers were trying to do with ""The Wolverine"" – I really do. They were trying to make an X-Men movie with less flash and more substance. And it was a good plan – taking a ""gritty"" and clichéd dark character and humanizing him with a lot of introspective character study. Which should have been the ingredients for a great movie.<br/><br/>This was an average film, though – I'd give it a 7 out of 10. For one, it was a bit slow and chatty at times for an ""X Men"" movie. For another, some of the action sequences and villains were just too cheesy. Silver Samurai reminded me constantly of the 1980's ""Voltron"" cartoon, and Viper was really just a poor man's Poison Ivy with unimpressive powers.<br/><br/>This movie does do a really nice job in upgrading an old action movie trope – fighting on the roof of a moving train. That was fun.<br/><br/>Can anyone explain to me how Wolverine got his claws back? How the hell did that happen?!<br/><br/>Also  is he mortal now? That would explain the ""older"" Wolverine we see in the posters for ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."""
"lasttimeisaw","5","1","3","9 April 2015"," The plot is untenable in retrospect
","Generally speaking, X-MEN series is my favorite among the superhero universe, yet the distant memory of Gavin Hood's X-MEN ORIGINS:WOLVERINE (2009, 7/10) has faded into blurry fragments, this time, Hugh Jackson's Logan (who is in top form in his Wolverine physique) embarks on an exotic journey in Japan, all by himself (with Jean haunting him all along to allure him into discard his immortality), to say a farewell to an old friend Yashida (Yahmamouchi) in his dying bed, whom in the opening sequences, Logan saves during the Nagasaki bombing, only to discover there is a sinister scheme awaits. <br/><br/>First of all, apart from the opening 20 minutes, the story exclusively takes place in the present Japan, which instantly sheds the fatigues of the usual westernized landscape and gives the film a perky start with all the intrigues of an impending internecine strife inside an affluential clan, then, gradually removes Wolverine off his instantaneously resuscitative superpower, makes him vulnerable while hatching a romance with Mariko (Okamoto), the granddaughter of Yashida and the forthcoming heiress of his entire enterprise, and saving her from the assault of yakuza sent by her power-seeking father Shingen (Sanada) and the voluptuous fiancé Noburo (Tee), which turns out to be a lame red-herring, frustratedly betrays the well-expected final twist, a subterfuge never altogether feasible in retrospect. <br/><br/>The action sequences are slick at its most, aka. the fight on top of a fleeting bullet train, and at its lowest is the showdown near the end, the villainess Viper (Khodchtenkova) doesn't live up to our expectation as an anomaly in this male-dominant profession of a brainy ringleader, neither does her combat skill. Otherwise, the routine stunts (samurai, yakuza and an over-sized robot in a shining armor etc.) can barely raise viewers's eyebrows.<br/><br/>The movie ostensibly offers a moderately engrossing experience for a first-viewing, nothing extraordinary, but also on a par with its blockbuster standard. Nevertheless, during the post mortem, the story itself contains a glaring plot-hole which cannot go without noticing. I hope I am not nitpicking, and spoilers alert, if all Yashida wants is to take over Wolverine's power of immortality, what's fuss to make all the tête-a-tête talk, cause family frictions, poison Logan with the risk of him being killed (I suppose a dead Wolverine is no good use for him), and fake his own death with his funeral being broadcast nationally, thus even he would acquire the immortality, how would he justify his outré rise from his grave? He could simply send Yukio (Fukushima) to convince Logan to fly to Japan, and clandestinely capture him using Viper's poison and take his power by force as they actually do in the climax, no more casualties needed in any rate. I blame this on the screenwriters' sloth to not even try to fabricate more sense for such a gigantic production. Or maybe this is purposefully conceived as a perspicacious mockery to the double-crossing psyche acutely concealed beneath the humble surface of the quintessential Japanese good manners? I hope it is merely my needless reckoning, otherwise James Mangold did have some guts to imprint his political spin into such a widely accessible Hollywood merchandise! Well, I doubt this is the case anyway."

","I grew up on comics through the 90s and although Wovie was never a favorite of mine, I did enjoy a few X-Men story archs. Enter this movie... I wouldn't say it deserves a 1 but it was well below average in many ways but most importantly, in its story telling aspects. I really don't care about flashy action or heavy graphic work but I do enjoy a well written story. If it has other good things then great but without a solid story, movie have no reason to exist. This one was poorly written and directed. It simply tried to encompass too many things in too little time. The romance did not work (at all). The action was boring. The story was absolutely idiotic and made no sense... and yet the movie takes itself serious. It should have been made into a comedy. Characters were not interesting and not well developed and the ending was a laugh (not in a good way).

"stephenlovelette","9","1","3","28 June 2014"," Ninjas and a viper; what's not to like?
","First, a caveat.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the X-Men franchise, Marvel Comics, and superhero movies in general. I rarely dislike them. Wolverine is one of my particular favorites.<br/><br/>On top of all that Hugh Jackman's my favorite actor. You might naturally assume I'd enjoy The Wolverine. However, I'd like to think I have high expectations.<br/><br/>That being said, to temper this stipulation, I heard negative reviews prior to seeing the film, so perhaps my expectation level was considerably below the norm.<br/><br/>I find The Wolverine immensely enjoyable. The plot is well-written, and according to Rotten Tomatoes, stays true to the comics in a satisfactory way for the fan-boy audience. There is more than one villain; each with their own compelling motivation.<br/><br/>The action is spectacular, the cinematography's a couple notches above average and the story involves some questions of moral ambiguity. Just barely breaching the two-hour mark, it toes the line between too long and too short. I don't think I need much more, but by no means is it a clock-watcher.<br/><br/>There are the usual pitfalls that come along with superhero movies today: A couple hokey character interactions, several moments are distracting in predictability, but overall, I think it's a very solid film.<br/><br/>Now, this section contains spoilers, so reader beware.<br/><br/>Let's begin with what works, which coincidentally starts at the film's open.<br/><br/>The opening scene is a dream within a dream: Something I've never experienced here in four- dimensional reality. It makes for good filmmaking, though.<br/><br/>Scientifically speaking, I'm skeptical of Wolverine's ability to protect the Japanese kid from harm, but damn it's cool to think how he suffers through the pain of the blast. It's heroic, and I like how Yukio's father reinterprets his experience into stories of the ""magic man"" who would protect her at night.<br/><br/>I also enjoy the interactions between Wolvey and the bear. The filmmakers are clearly trying to move things in a more artistic direction, attempting to draw more meaningful connections from the story of a tragic superhero.<br/><br/>The fights are nothing short of exceptional. Not only the ninja capture of Wolverine, but also the action between him and the yakuza thugs atop the bullet train. It makes the turn from ""good enough"" to ""spectacular"" when he out smarts the last thug rather than resorting to brute force.<br/><br/>Both villains are great, but I can used a bit more face time with Viper. Aside from her intriguing mutation, I'm unfamiliar with the actress (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and I think she's convincingly sinister. The green suit, noxious breath and strawberry blonde hair are a helluva combo.<br/><br/>Apropos of Viper, here are some things that don't work so well. Her mutation is complicated and only mentioned once, so I'm unclear on her part in the grander evil scheme until conversing post-credits.<br/><br/>Another downside includes the occasional tiny wink of poor editing, and the dying bear is very clearly animatronic at one point. Early on, some hunters are firing guns outside a supermarket, and the cliché scene reeks of ""troublemaking.""<br/><br/>In my notes, I write down that ""upright chopsticks are reminiscent of incest at a funeral,"" but think I hear her wrong. I believe the word is ""incense,"" which is quite dissimilar.<br/><br/>On an unrelated note, I appreciate the tormented visions of Jean Grey but can't help thinking there are sources of greater guilt in his history.<br/><br/>Finally, I could have slapped my buddy in the face at the exact moment Mariko's husband did the same to her.<br/><br/>All that being said, be you a biased or unbiased viewer, I think The Wolverine is a fantastic movie. Easily worth the five dollars to catch the flick on demand and I would have paid double to see it in the theater."
"MLDinTN","3","1","3","28 June 2014"," the wolverine franchise needs to stop here

Then it's present time and Logan is living in rural area. Yukio, working for Yashida, brings Logan to Japan where the rest of the story takes place. Yashida wants Logan's ability to heal and live for many many years, since he is dieing. He hires Viper to steel Logan's healing power. Also Logan is protecting Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko. So a lot of the movie is the bad guys chasing Mariko and Logan protecting her but without all of his abilities. And then you could see the surprise ending coming a mile away with Yashida. The whole story was just not that good.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Wolverine is better in the X-Men films then this. You can skip this."

The same scenario in which the story takes place, ie the mystical and legendary Japan, is little used and in its place then if they could replace many others. The secondary characters are poorly characterized, stereotypical and some of them even annoying. the fundamental theme of alienation of the mutants, the backbone of other chapters, there is humor and Marvel, as always many years now, it's boring and out of place. What can you then save half of this disaster?

White guy goes to Asia beats up all the Asian men, bangs an Asian girl and ends up saving the day. We have seen that story line a million times before and turns off anyone who isn't white as a Hollywood cliché.

","Logan, or else, wolverine, is hiding in a cave, driven by remorse for killing Jean, the woman he loved. However, a man who he had saved during the world war two reaches out for him and Logan travels to Japan, to say his last goodbyes to him, as he is dying. But his friend offers him a choice, to take his gift and become mortal or to continue a pointless life. Now, 2 out of 10 isn't because of the type of the film. I love the x men movie series, and any other action science fiction comic based movies. So the 2 might hide a disappointment for the finale result. The good thing about the film is the atmosphere, very Japan and ninja, and the fighting scenes. However, all the rest are very bad. 1) The performances are so-so, some very bad, but they do get better towards the end. 2)Usually you can spot a goof after the third time you watch the film. Here however there are so obvious that they can't be unmissed. It actually seem as if the film was rushed through modaze that the scenes were randomly chosen. 3)The movie is about mutants, and wolverine, but the only mutants are (counting) : the wolverine obviously, the creepy snake lady and the high fashion heap Japanese girl with the red hair. 4) Too much blood and medical scenes. 5) Too much Japanese. I mean I get it, the movie is in Japan, but it is an action movie, where you have to focus on the fighting and not on the subs. So if in Memoirs of a geisha Japanese would have been a good addition, here they are too much, as half the script is in that language. 6) speaking of which, the script tries to be funny, but it is not, the lines are terrible. 7) The story line is good, but there are too many flash backs. And Jean's memory- nightmare is getting tiring at some point. 8) finally the ending wasn't that good, and at the same action level as the rest of the movie. The extra seen after the credits was excellent, an amuse bouche for the next movie. So, 2 out of 10 because the one before it was way way better."

It's like the people that make these movies have no real connection to the subject matter. Just another Audi commercial and shameless cash grab for the Asian demographic. Get rid of women and their lame dialogue. This girl power crap in Hollywood needs to come to an end. Overall, just another x-men movie that fails to deliver. Wow, what a terribly executed plot. This movie is pure diarrhea. The guy that wolverine saves ends up trying to take his powers. It takes 2 hours of women rambling to get this point across. A terrible movie. The people who produced this movie had one thing in mind. That is, capturing the Asian demographic and sucking cash out of them simply by setting the movie in Japan and including some ornamental samurai swords. I will never pay to see an x-men movie again."
"Vivekmaru45","3","1","3","18 January 2014"," What's the difference between a Japanese Geisha and The Wolverine?
","Well the Geisha loves to eat sushi, while The Wolverine can make sushi out the Geisha girl(LOL).<br/><br/>Now that the jokes over, lets get on with the review. Having seen the previous X-men Origins: Wolverine 2009 film, I expected this one to be some notches better. Nope, that was no to be. Bitterly disappointed. <br/><br/>The film is set in the country of Japan. X-men is a U.S. franchise, so whats the idea behind a Japanese setting? Maybe the Japanese are biggest buyers of U.S. anime and comic books(?) Well if that's the case....<br/><br/>The film opens in 1945. Wolverine is held in a Japanese POW camp near Nagasaki. During the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Logan rescues a Japanese officer named Yashida and shields him from the blast. Yashida repays the favor by helping Wolverine escape from Japan.<br/><br/>Years later in the present day, Yashida wishes to see Wolverine again and so he sends Yukio, a mutant with the precognitive ability to foresee people's deaths, to fetch him. Wolverine refuses to go at first, but then reluctantly agrees to go possibly because Yashida helped him escape from Japan. <br/><br/>The rest of the film moves to Japan till its conclusion. <br/><br/>I'm a fan of Hugh Jackman since the X-Men Trilogy of films days. Those films were the cream of the crop, because they starred established Hollywood actors the likes of: Ian Mckellen, Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen etc., etc. Also good script, plot and setting for the film. <br/><br/>This film feels like it does no belong in the X-men universe. And even Hugh Jackman cannot rescue the film, because of the bogus plot and horrible supporting cast of actors. Even the special effects in the film are mediocre, compared to films like The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-man which I enjoyed immensely.<br/><br/>Verdict: if you expect this film to be better than the X-Men films you are in for a big disappointed. If you want to kill some time, why not watch it for free online."

","I have always loved the X-Men movies, so when The Wolverine came out I was extremely excited. But not for long. Although I tend to forgive some of the smaller inconsistencies, this movie has the biggest plot hole I have ever seen. The story COULD NOT have happened. Here's why: In the beginning of The Wolverine, Logan saves Yashida from the Nagasaki explosion in WWII (1945). It then cuts to present day, where the rest of the story takes place. Logan gets called to Japan by Yashida (who is now on his deathbed) and all hell breaks loose. However, according to previous X-Men movies, Logan would not have remembered Yashida AT ALL. Logan has no recollection of anything prior to 1979 after being shot by an adamantium bullet. Therefore, he would not have gone to Japan and none of this would have happened. I'm not quite sure how the screenplay (let alone the entire movie) got past the editing process with a plot hole of this magnitude. To say the least, The Wolverine was one of the most disappointing movies I have seen in years."

I still don't understand why Mariko was left heir. Shingen could have been a cool character, but he was not. I don't understand why he changed his mind at the end to be good. Yukio's character was decent and her fight scenes were cool. Markio and Logan's romance was unnecessary. I didn't understand how Yukio got through the village at the end of the movie if it was supposedly guarded with ninjas everywhere. She just drove right through to the gate without being spotted.

"eddie_baggins","3","1","3","15 December 2013"," Nice change of setting but horrible movie
","It's never a great indictment of a movie when it's two best scenes are bookend in the opening and then the closing credits sequence, Wolverine is prime example of this for James Mangold's Asian centred reboot of the reboot is a movie so forgettable it can only be described as a degrading piece of work on Hugh Jackman's CV.<br/><br/>Beyond being milked dry now the Wolverine incarnation that Jackman continues to portray (whether by want or contractual obligation I am not entirely sure) has become so stale on screen that not even a jolt of Storm's electricity could revive it. Many upon release actually heralded this movie as the venture we'd been waiting for but I would beg to differ and say that this film is barely more enjoyable than Origins, the truly awful first solo outing of the side burned hero and makes the whole film a slog to get through.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold has a steady hand behind the camera but one wishes that the film's original director Darren Aronofsky would of stuck out the journey because the film feels stunningly flat with only the aforementioned opening and end credits scene really feeling energetic. Fights are played out in generic style, one liner's sign posted from a mile off and countless unnecessary sub plots seemingly placed into the film for no good reason with all this leading to one of the year's lamest and overlong finales that would of undone any good works previous to it anyway.<br/><br/>It's nice to see a superhero movie not set in a big American city and Hugh Jackman is never bad but one wishes he would look for more challenging roles such as he did with Les Miserables and the fantastic Prisoners. With Days of Future Past out next year it will be interesting to see how big of a role Wolverine plays in proceedings but after this effort I think it best he plays minimal roles and perhaps retires for good into the wilderness living out his days with Grizzly bears for I think we have seen just about enough of him by now.<br/><br/>1 and a half crispy fried Hugh Jackman's out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","At the end of World War 2, Wolverine was held captive in a Japanese POW camp where he saved a young solider named Yashida. In the process, Yashida witnessed Wolverine's ability to withstand physical trauma and quickly heal from it. Flash forward to the present where Wolverine is hiding out in the far North and being haunted by the events that took place in X-Men 3. It is here that Yukio, a mutant with the ability to foresee people's deaths, tracks Wolverine down and convinces him to go back to Japan with her.<br/><br/>X-Men was a solid, well-made super-hero film and set the standard for all future Marvel comic book adaptations to live-up to. X-Men 2 (aka X2 and X-Men United) took on a story with multiple plots that almost seemed too much for a single film to handle, yet somehow director Bryan Singer was able to pull it off. Thanks to Brett Ratner, one of the most hated directors in Hollywood, the X-Men film franchise almost lost all of it's credibility thanks to X-Men 3 (aka X-Men: The Last Stand). The third film was a complete mess that is best forgotten, and thankfully it's events will be erased next year with X-Men: Days Of Future Past. The next film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, took everyone's favorite on-screen mutant to new lows. Wolverine went from a real, gritty anti-hero to a cartoonish action star. While Wolverine's backstory had excellent potential to become it's own trilogy, screenwriters David Benioff and Skip Woods proved to be unworthy of adapting the source material. If the screenplay wasn't bad enough, director Gavin Hood's choices to bring the script to life were all wrong. Over-the-top, laughable action sequences with special effects that were a decade behind their time.<br/><br/>Thankfully director Matthew Vaughn brought hope back to the X-Men films with X-Men: First Class. Vaughn's prequel not only gave new life to the series, with an excellent new cast, it surpassed the greatness of any of the previous X-Men films. When it was announced Darren Aronofsky was attached to direct The Wolverine, the hype became almost impossible for any film to live-up to. When Aronofsky dropped out, Twentieth Century Fox replaced the acclaimed director with James Mangold. Mangold may not have allure of Aronofsky but he does have some Oscar winning titles under his belt, such as Girl, Interrupted and Walk The Line. However his career took a turn for the worse with his last film, the Tom Cruise & Cameron Diaz disaster, Knight and Day, which tried to be an action-comedy but instead was annoyingly unbearable to sit through. Mangold had a chance to make-up for Knight and Day with The Wolverine but has failed miserably.<br/><br/>The Wolverine sheds the cartoonish action of X-Men Origins and brings back the gritty anti-hero. Only now Wolverine is more depressed than angry. The film is darker and hints at becoming a character study but is interrupted by a plot from an out-dated James Bond film. Meanwhile Wolverine is being haunted by nightmares of Jean Grey, something that only becomes more and more irritating as the film moves forward. These dream sequences are also a constant reminder of the film we've all tried hard to forget, X-Men 3.<br/><br/>There is more story than action but we find ourselves wanting to see Wolverine in-action instead of wandering around Tokyo sad and wounded. Too much is explained in areas of the story that we do not care about, or are not necessary, while the things we want explained never are. When we finally do get the action we've been waiting for it plays out more like an R-rated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.<br/><br/>Aside from Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen, everyone in this film lacks the ability to act or speak understandable English. The special effects are as bad as X-Men Origins and the action/fight sequences lack any tension or excitement. What makes matters worse is that we already know X-Men: Days Of Future Past is going to erase the events of this film, so in the end, we have no reason to actually care what happens.<br/><br/>The Wolverine, at it's best, is boring. It makes X-Men Origins look like the action epic it tried to be. The only redeemable thing about this entire production is that one day it will be a great film to throw on and make fun of with your friends at how horrible it truly is."
"dinalt10","6","1","3","25 November 2013"," Good.......................but
","I'll start by saying this is a good film..............just don't go in expecting non stop action.<br/><br/>But, and a big but, it's only really Hugh Jackman who keeps the film going. Now that's understandable in some ways, given that he's the lead character - but the others really aren't explored well at all.<br/><br/>And sadly, none of the other characters are particularly likable. Which (yet again in a film) means you don't really care whether they live or die.<br/><br/>It's a film that could have delved far deeper into Wolverines dark side - but I get the feeling that the script was watered down so the film would get a lower rating. And that's a shame, as while the film attempts to create a rounded adult comic book story, it's let down at almost every hurdle.<br/><br/>I don't know what the ratings are elsewhere, but here in the UK DVD release it's a '12' - which means anyone 12 years or older can watch it.<br/><br/>So there are areas that could have taken the character deeper - hell, the film even included a love hotel, a fiancé partying with what I guess were hookers and an old man ready to sacrifice everyone so he could keep on ticking.<br/><br/>Anyway..............the film in a nutshell:<br/><br/>Wolverine's living like a hermit, gets invited to Japan to say goodbye to an old man whose life he saved in WW2. Old man wants to steal Wolverines powers, so his evil hired mutant puts a parasite? on Wolverines heart.<br/><br/>Rest of the film is basically Wolverine coming to terms with being vulnerable, having discussions with the dead Jean Gray and ultimately getting his mojo back.<br/><br/>Problem is, the ending was obvious from the beginning of the film - no suspense, no real build up, just disappointing.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, you're left asking why the old man didn't just keep Wolverine at his estate and take his power. With his healing power suppressed by the 'parasite' thing, Wolverine could just have been gassed and the old man could have got what he wanted.<br/><br/>Instead of which, Wolverine's left to roam Japan, getting shot and beaten..............and risking death as he can't heal. And his hands still heal, even with his healing powers suppressed - odd, as his knuckle area should be scarred and bleeding most of the film.<br/><br/>That said, Hugh Jackman once again excels at Wolverine - he was born to play the part.<br/><br/>Just hoping that he gets the Wolverine script he richly deserves before he's too old to play Logan."

","Most people would say that X-Men 3: The Last Stand was the worst of the X-Men franchise but I actually would say that all of the films up until The Wolverine have been very good including X-Men 3. I had heard very mixed opinions about The Wolverine but I assumed that it would have to be at least good...I assumed wrong. First of all, what a mess. What an awful, complex, silly, over thought mess ruined by someones delusions of turning Wolverine into some sort of Ninja epic. Perhaps the worst sin of this film is that Wolverine isn't even himself. He isn't doing what he does best for most of the film and that is truly a shame. Hugh Jackman was perhaps one of the best casting jobs in Hollywood history and they completely lay waste to his talent and to the character in general. The action scenes are few and far between making everything in between drag excruciatingly. I realized after about an hour and a half that I was more or less completely lost and worst of all I didn't care at all that I was lost. The pointless and needless tie in to the previous X-Men Franchise marred this film terribly. We don't need to be reminded every ten minutes that Logan is torn up over Jean Grey. I don't know why we're wrapping this franchise back around it's original from ten plus years ago.<br/><br/>I certainly don't place any of the blame of Hugh Jackman. He instantly embodies everything about Wolverine and is brilliant in the role...usually. Unfortunately this particular adventure leaves so much to be desired and reduces him to barely a shell of the former character. It is literally like the life is nearly gone from Wolverine. I hate to bash the rest of the cast because I don't necessarily think the poor performances were entirely their fault. The other characters are so drab and so cookie cutter without any development and you never become attached to any of them. Total newcomer Rila Fukushima looks stunned through the whole movie. The chemistry opposite Jackman is barely existent and her character gets lots in a convoluted plot. Same could be said for Tao Okamoto who requires even more chemistry with Jackman and yet has even less with him. Hal Yamanouchi is a decent villain but somehow he is underused but also overplayed at the same time. He comes across as campy. Many of the performances reminded me a lot of Pacific Rim from earlier this year and believe me when I say that is NOT a compliment.<br/><br/>I was a little surprised to see James Mangold was helming this film because he is a talented director. Marvel, overall, has had the smarts to put a comic geek at heart at the helm of each of their pictures and I think perhaps Mangold is a real grown up and not a comic geek and it sort of ruined the film. I am devastated that he is attached to do the next Wolverine film too because this was just an enormous mis-step in the X-Men lore. Literally the best scene of the entire film was the after credits scene. The train battle scene mid-film that I thought looked like awful CGI in the trailer actually turned out to be the best fight in the film and the most action. None of this made sense and none of it felt like Wolverine. I am literally angry that this was so bad. If you're a Marvel fan you will see it regardless but be prepared for the worst appearance yet from a comic hero. 3/10"

","The smartest thing the filmmakers did was taking the character Logan to the abroad. With all the new faces around the movie looked very well refreshed like we do in desktop and laptop. Except few minutes in the beginning rest of the story takes place in Japan. Even the story had connection with Nagasaki's atom bomb incident. The incident was very finely blended with this sixth installment of the 'X-Men' movie series.<br/><br/>It won't tell this movie has connections with other 'X-Men' movies except his hallucinations of 'First Class's end incident. The character Logan is the only one who derived from it and tells his story when he was held prisoner in Japan during the world war two. He saves a young soldier Yashida from the nuke blast. After many years the Logan was requested to visit dying him to say the one final goodbye. But the war begins when enemies try to abduct Yashida's granddaughter who is a new CEO of his tech corporation. It forces Logan to fight Yakuzas and ninjas where his mutant power will be tested.<br/><br/>Everyone around me liked the 'First Class' but for me it was just okay. In fact 'X-Men' movies were never been my kinda movie, as a die hard movie fan I enjoyed the marvelous visual effects. Like I said the advantage was the atmosphere in the story with all the new casts. While you are engaged to see Logan fighting the bad guys, the story takes a quick turn and brings the twist and I did know it was coming. This movie was totally fresh and unique from all the previous movies, just like I wanted. It was not a massive fight movie with highly influenced by the mutant's magical stuffs but it had its own and sufficient stunt sequences that one can enjoy.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","After three X-Men movies, a mediocre origin story and a short cameo, the Wolverine finally gets the stand alone film he deserved.<br/><br/>If you always had wanted to see a movie delve deep in the Wolverine mythology, his personality his mentality and his rage filled problems, this is the movie for you! <br/><br/>Taking place mostly in Japan (except for like three Canadian filled scenes, this movie isolates Logan from all familiarity and puts him in a situation of finding what he truly stands and lives for.<br/><br/>At first the plot seemed simple. Logan is stripped from his awesome powers and has to get them back. But the good thing about this movie is it delves deep into his personality and into other interesting plot points. There are various groups and sides in this movie and you never know who to trust and who to hate (except the Yakuza, those are some straight up assholes). The story always gets you to point badass A. to point badass B. and when it isn't kicking ass it is immersing you into the Japanese coulture and some cool Marvel stuff too. The only familiar face is Logan's and every other character is new and surprisingly interesting. I was never annoyed by any cast member. And of course Hugh Jackman plays the role like a fierce and rage filled badass.<br/><br/>The story could not have been good without the great thematisation of the character's surroundings. Japan is colorful and vivid, the sets are very detailed and some scenes just stand out like the opening, the finale and that one awesome bullet train action scene! Speeking of bullet trains one complaint is that the camera man seemed to be stuck in one through some action sequences. The shaky cam was sometimes overused and it just pulled me out of the action. But there are some moments that just get your veins pumping with that awesome geek blood that we all got. <br/><br/>The wolverine in general isn't a comic book masterpiece but it took us in a more personal journey that explored the character through the whole deal and gave us some memorable action scenes.<br/><br/>I give this bad boy an 8 outta 10!"
"nab_saleh","7","1","3","17 November 2013"," Good entertainment!
","I went into the movie banking on my prior liking for James Mangold's work (Knight & Day, Copland)and the Japanese setting. After watching the movie I was pretty pleased with the effort put in! i.e.the story besides some late twist was kinda old school but neatly handled. Furthermore, dialogs were good (much better than the first part!), acting kind-of ranged from fair to good, character development was fine and action sequences were also quite nicely done! <br/><br/>That said there were hardly any moments where I got distracted and that is some feat since the movie features a runtime of more than 2 hours.<br/><br/>It seems to be getting clearer with time why so many Wolverine fans had a fallout with this movie. Prior to its release the film was said to be based on the respected Wolverine comic to date, maybe those who read it found the movie to be seriously falling short of it; I never read it so I couldn't spot the differences i.e. if there were some. Secondly, almost all of the talk between Japanese characters (which amounts to more than 90%) in the movie is in Japanese which I believe is the right thing to do but may be this turned out to be a turn off! <br/><br/>Nonetheless, The Wolverine is much better than its predecessor and with reviews being heavily polarized on this one, the viewer better check it out. This is much better than the awful Ironman 3 and numerous other garbage movies rocking the B.O!"
"estebangonzalez10","7","1","3","7 November 2013"," The Wolverine has more substance just as Hugh Jackman has more muscles here
","¨What they did to me, what I am, can't be undone.¨<br/><br/>It seems that adding the ¨The¨to the title nowadays makes every movie look a bit cooler and it actually works for this film because The Wolverine is much better than its predecessor, X-Men Origins - Wolverine. Logan was one of my favorite characters in the X-Men trilogy and it was a shame the origin story didn't work too well because he is such an interesting character and there are so many places you could go with it. Director James Mangold (who has a favorable track record with me: Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma) succeeds here by taking Logan to Japan, which many fans of the comics may agree is one of their personal favorite moments (Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's 1982 run). Having the events of this film take place after The Last Stand also allowed Mangold to have more space to work with and focus on Logan's inner demons as he deals with the loss of Jean Grey. Fans won't be disappointed because the character is carefully developed here and unlike its predecessor the action scenes work to build the story and not the other way around where you have the typical superhero movie that jumps from one action scene to the next without any apparent purpose. The action scenes are also beautifully choreographed here (I am specially thinking of that train sequence). Another thing that worked for me is that you don't have Logan trying to save the world; the entire plot takes place almost entirely in Japan. It is a small scale film unlike recent superhero films where everything takes place around the globe while entire cities are being blown to pieces. And finally the film has a great scene after the credits that connect things nicely to the next X-Men film coming out next year. The Wolverine is a solid film and one of the better superhero films of the year. <br/><br/>The film takes place around two years after the events of The Last Stand. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is living on his own in the Yukon constantly having nightmares about Jean (Famke Janssen). He has been living as a nomad in the woods conflicted with the fact that he has lost so many dear loved ones. One day while having a small dispute with some hunters at a near town he encounters Yukio (Rila Fukushima) a Japanese red haired woman who has come to persuade him to come to Japan to say goodbye to her master, Yashida (Ken Yamamura), who is dying from cancer. Logan saved Yashida's life 70 years ago during WWII in Nagasaki and now he wants to say goodbye to him. Logan decides to travel to Japan to say his farewell, but once he is there Yashida presents him with a unique opportunity: he claims his company has the technological advances to make him mortal again. He knows eternity has been a curse for him, and offers him the opportunity of becoming mortal, but Logan refuses the offer. He then asks Logan to stay for a couple of days and protect his granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), who he believes is in danger. That night Logan awakens to find that Yashida has passed away. During the funeral some yakuza try to attack Mariko, but Logan saves her. For the first time in his life Logan doesn't seem to recover from his injuries, but that doesn't prevent him from protecting Mariko from the people that are after her. The Wolverine now must learn how to face an unknown enemy while at the same time deal with his immortality. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman looked better than ever as Wolverine (this is the fifth time he repeats the role). He owns the character in probably the same way that Robert Downey Jr. owns Iron Man and is physically in better shape than in his previous films. The film also seems to have more depth and substance as the character is better developed here. It also has what a superhero film must have which are thrilling action scenes, but there is much more to this film. The story is dark and isn't as fast paced, but it is satisfying. My only complaint has to do with the final act which is a little too cartoonish and generic, but it doesn't hurt the overall effectiveness of the film. I really had a fun time with this film and it has me hooked with how they are going to tie things up with the next film of the franchise."

","The Wolverine was quite good until the final act. In that final act, it took on the characteristics of a Roger Moore variety Bond film. After a very suspenseful build-up, the climax got a little silly. Despite the silliness, the movie wasn't destroyed, just diminished.<br/><br/>Advice to people who haven't been following X Men or Wolverine, familiarize yourself through some internet searching with the Wolverine's back story. It will help you figure things out in the movie's flashback scenes.<br/><br/>Speaking of flashes, the atomic explosion (I won't say when or where) was a little underwhelming. It looked more like a hydrocarbon explosion that a nuclear pop. Its effects seemed muted and slow motion also.<br/><br/>There was a dandy battle on top of a bullet train. Very exciting and well done.

"thisglimpse-1","4","1","3","13 August 2013"," He's Back Again
","We like Wolverine. Apparently we really like him; ""The Wolverine"" is the sixth movie in which Hugh Jackman's played the character, which was created in 1974 by Len Wein and John Romita, Sr. (He was originally an enemy of the Hulk.) To understand why we like him so much, I think it's helpful to think back to 1974. America had just lost the war in Vietnam, thanks to the politicians despite winning all the battles (whether or not this is factually true, it was the general zeitgeist of the time.) We'd just found out our President was a crook, and forced him to resign. A lot of Americans had a lot of rage, a problem with authority, a hard time trusting anybody, but also a deep thirst for justice and revenge. We'd stopped believing the system was ever going to deliver it for us, and were ready to get it any way possible. We felt powerful, cheated, and somebody needed to pay. As Wolverine's popularity skyrocketed in the comic books, Clint Eastwood became one of the most popular stars in Hollywood playing a brooding cop with a big gun who always got the bad guy but had a hard time playing by the rules. There's a lot of Dirty Harry in Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine, and I'm still waiting for the movie that introduces Eastwood as Logan's long-lost father.<br/><br/>""The Wolverine"" picks up where ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" left off, which is a bit of a stumble, because that movie was made 7 years ago and there have been two X-Men films since then. It took me a while to recapture the storyline: Logan killed Jean Grey, the woman he loved, because her alternate personality the Phoenix, was taking over and destroying everyone and everything around her.<br/><br/>Wolverine has fled to somewhere very wooded and become Grizzly Adams. He is haunted by dreams of Jean Grey, and promises never to hurt anyone again ever, a promise he keeps for about five minutes, until someone hurts one of his ursine friends. While he is beating up rednecks, a pink-haired Japanese ninja girl (Rila Fukushima) finds him and begs him to come to Tokyo, where a man he once saved is dying, and wants to say goodbye.<br/><br/>Logan agrees, and somehow never suspects that the man he is going to see-- billionaire tech giant Yashida, played by Haruhiko Yamanouchi -- might have an ulterior motive for bringing him across the ocean. Logan gets embroiled in a complicated, nearly incoherent family controversy, wherein the Yakuza are trying to assassinate the old man's granddaughter, except maybe they're hired by the pretty girl's father, who's mad that he's not mentioned in the old man's will, except maybe not, because there's also a playboy fiancée with political ambitions and a jilted boyfriend with lots of ninja friends, and maybe the old man's not as dead as he appears.<br/><br/>I don't know if it all makes sense. I don't feel like wasting the brainpower it would take to untangle it all and see if it makes sense. What it all boils down to is that Logan is going to protect the pretty granddaughter (Tao Okamota) because she's pretty and vulnerable and likes to kiss him. And a lot of people want to kill her, some with guns and some with swords and some with poison-tipped arrows, and it's not all that important who sent them, or why.<br/><br/>""The Wolverine's"" convoluted plot, as well as an airless, joyless third act where everything is explained but nothing makes sense, are the film's weaknesses. But it has plenty of strengths. The film is strong on atmosphere and aesthetics, and director James Mangold knows how to make the most of his Japanese settings. It's packed to the brim with exciting action sequences, including one aboard a bullet train sequence bears more than a passing resemblance to the space suit action sequence in ""Star Trek: Into Darkness."" I don't say that to disrespect it; these two are probably the best two action sequences in movies this summer.<br/><br/>This is as much a samurai film as a superhero film, and that's pretty cool. Svetlana Khodchenkova has a lot of fun playing sexy villainess Viper, who likes to wear green, scaly tight-fitting things and kills people by kissing them with her acidic, forked tongue. She's not really given enough to do and her death is anticlimactic, but the Russian actress makes the most of what the script and the screen time give her.<br/><br/>Also, she has the unexplained ability to take away Wolverine's healing factor, rendering him killable. The script makes the most of this, and Jackman's meets them halfway; the result is a protagonist who isn't invulnerable (like Superman and Thor,) but seems genuinely surprised by how much being hurt, well, hurts. Logan briefly contemplates letting himself be killed, so that he can join Jean Grey (and the countless other people he's watched die over his 200-year lifespan) in the afterlife. But there's the ingénue to save from the bad guys. Sigh... seems like there's always an ingénue to save from the bad guys. Superheroes never get a chance to spend quality time with their loved ones, dead or alive. It's a tough life.<br/><br/>I wonder if, as an audience, we'll ever grow tired of Wolverine. 1974 was a long time ago, and it's been a while since we nearly impeached a president or lost a war. I suppose there's always plenty to be angry about, but successful, entertaining and even humorous movies featuring more brightly colored, optimistic superheroes - guys like Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - make me think the age of the dark, angsty protagonist may finally be coming to an end. There's another X-Men movie in the works (make sure to stick through the credits to see the teaser for ""Days of Future Past"") but maybe after that, Jackman can hang up the claws once and for all."
"Mess8424","7","1","3","22 August 2013"," Wolverine is back with a vengeance
","This movie really served one specific purpose. I think its goal was to give a true Wolverine movie for the fans, and scratch X-Men Origins: Wolverine from their minds. And it does exactly that. <br/><br/>The movie's plot is based on a comic, so expect to see a lot of references to other Marvel things in the movie, some subtle, some obvious. The special effects are very well done in almost every instance, and the claws actually look real this time around. Of course, this movie isn't going to be like the Dark Knight trilogy (which it seems a lot of people relate superhero movies to these days). It has cheesy dialogue that one can only expect from Wolverine. But they make it work well.<br/><br/>One thing I truly disliked about the movie was an unavoidable issue. Bone claws. I think it is safe to say that nobody likes the bone claws. I know they were necessary, but they aren't in any way ""cool""...Also, I feel like the ending was a little abrupt, and it didn't show how Wolverine recovered from the events of the film.<br/><br/>As you probably know by now, make sure you stay past the credits. I practically started crying with excitement when I saw this hidden ending. If you are a true X-Men fan, you can probably form an idea of what/who is in the ending, but it was absolutely perfect for said fans nonetheless.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend it to any superhero lovers. But you may want to brush up on your Wolverine knowledge (watching Origins would suffice) if you want to understand the movie."
"jellyneckr","Null","1","3","29 July 2013"," Great until the third act
","The 2013 summer movie season has been filled with films that have relied heavily on action and relied very little on an interesting or original story. This should come as no surprise as the studio blockbuster mentality the past few years has been that movies should be loud, brainless, and should depend on action over character. Going into The Wolverine, I was expecting the film to follow this same model. To my surprise, for the first two thirds of its running time, The Wolverine is the absolute best film of the summer, a big-budget spectacle that actually pays attention to characters and tells an interesting, compelling, and intense story. Director James Mangold sets a very distinct tone from the other X-Men movies right off the bat with great opening sequences that set aside any notions that will just be another dumb action picture. Mangold takes the material seriously, allowing for a few fantastic jokes when necessary, but otherwise maintaining a strong sense of solemn atmosphere. He also knows how to direct action without resorting to choppy editing or fast motion and slow motion nonsense. Mangold perfectly mixes thematic elements involving Wolverine's depressed state in a mature and thoughtful manner with the necessary fight set-pieces. Additionally, Hugh Jackman gives his best performance yet as Wolverine. This is certainly the most dramatic of any of the installments of the X-Men series and Jackman cranks up the intensity, rage, and sadness of his character to degrees not seen before. Jackman's performance was the main reason I was convinced by the 90-minute mark this was the best X-Men production yet. But then, just as the film was reaching absolute greatness, came the last 30 minutes.<br/><br/>While the last act of The Wolverine by no means ruins the film entirely, it does make me question what went on behind the scenes. The third act shifts the flick into dumb summer movie mode and the serious, intense tone established so well by Mangold is thrown out the window for a series of plot twists and action sequences that become increasingly more ridiculous. To make matters worse, one of the plot ""twists"" is eerily similar to one that was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (it wasn't a good idea there either). The last 20 minutes really do feel like somebody made the decision that there needed to be scenes that resemble Iron Man or Transformers because, well, those made a lot of money. While the action that preceded this point is rather nicely woven into the overall plot, the action in the finale is simply there for the sake of action. Fights drag on and on, characters fall down only to get up again repeatedly, and the pace is slowed down as a result. The film eventually recovers enough to have a satisfying final scene, but by then The Wolverine as an overall motion picture feels slightly cheapened, compromised, and less satisfying.<br/><br/>Even with the very disappointing third act, it's hard to deny that there are very powerful scenes in The Wolverine. Mangold's direction and Jackman's performance is absolutely fantastic. It seems unlikely that there will be another solo Wolverine adventure based on the U.S. box office performance of this one, though with what Mangold and Jackman accomplished The Wolverine, there has finally been a mostly solid Wolverine outing that does the character and the audience justice. This is, by far, Mangold's best effort yet and the best best of the summer. 7/10"

","So I saw The Wolverine today, this was a brilliant film and in my opinion one of the best to date. It wasn't afraid to take a brake from action and slow it down to allow the story to soak it so that you weren't always confused.<br/><br/>The slow paced parts weren't terrible and boring, they were needed to allow you to understand what was going on and it isn't always good to have non-stop action.<br/><br/>The fighting on top of the train scene was brilliant, it brought fast paced action, it really did draw you into the movie, if you were bored previously, this was the best wake-up call you ever received!<br/><br/>Now the only part of this movie which stopped it getting a 10/10 (in my opinion) was that it was very predictable.) It was predictable to the point where it felt like I had written the script & directed it myself.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Overall I would give this movie an 8 and a half out of 10.

So when he dies unexpectedly, Logan has another dream of Jean Grey which later changed when the woman he met enters his room, and strikes. Her name is Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), another strange mutant. So at the funeral, the Yakuza (Japanese mafia) attack, and everyone takes action. Logan makes his known berserker attacks, but something was wrong. His healing factor has been negated. He takes Mariko into safety, and in another nightmare about Jean, his Adamantium claws doesn't frighten her. Yukio has the power to see death occur makes her an asset to Logan. So she ends up his bodyguard during Mariko's kidnapping and Logan's weakened state. But after he found the cause, she was still needed. Mariko helped out Logan against the Silver Samurai.

The man he saved in World War 2 is now an old dying man and he asks Wolverine if he wants to transfer his powers and immortality to someone else, but Wolverines refuses. Later on, the old man dies.<br/><br/>It turns out the old man's son Shingen wanted his dad to die just because his dad didn't want Shingen to be the chairman of his company. The plot really sounded like a ripoff of Gladiator.<br/><br/>All of these guys were trying to get Mariko, who was the old man's granddaughter, and Wolverine was trying his best to defend her. And for what? All because some old guy didn't want his son to be the chairman of his company? Completely idiotic.<br/><br/>When Mariko finally gets caught, she gets brought to where her grandfather was born in. It turns out the building her grandfather was born in is now some secret science facility or whatever. Wolverine goes after her and for some odd reason, Mariko was able to see Wolverine running on the street from miles away.<br/><br/>When Wolverine is brought to the facility, there is this giant robotic samurai that is made of adamantium. Wolverine fights this giant robotic samurai and at the end of the fight, it turns out the giant robotic samurai was controlled by Mariko's grandfather from the inside! He never died! WTF?! What was the point of him faking his death? It turns out the whole point of that giant robotic samurai was to drain Wolverine's powers out of him and transfer his powers to Mariko's grandfather. WTF?! Completely moronic! That was so fvcking stupid. They went through all that work building that giant robotic samurai made of adamantium just to drain Wolverine's powers out of him? And the old man wants Wolverine's powers so he could be young again and live forever.<br/><br/>I find it hilarious how Yukio is able to cut through chains by using a katana. And the actress who played as Mariko could not act for shlt! And the scene where the blonde Viper woman was chasing down Wolverine as he was about to fight the giant robotic samurai and the Viper woman started hissing like a snake and then got shot in the chest by an arrow, yea, that scene was corny as shlt.<br/><br/>I hate how every time Hollywood hires Asian actors, they always make the Asian actors to play as these stereotypical Asian characters like they're nerdy, they do kung fu, they're highly traditional, or they use katanas. It's hilariously ridiculous! I guess Hollywood still has not learned that most Asian people live her lives just like everyone else and their minds aren't stuck in the 14th century or something stupid like that.<br/><br/>I'm giving this 4/10 stars because the movie is a bit more violent and has some blood in a few scenes."

I don't know about you, but I would sure like to see Wolverine in some real hard-core ""no-holds-barred"" film that doesn't wimp out and cater to the mindset of just kids.<br/><br/>Let-down #4 - I'd definitely say it's time to dispense with Wolverine's irksome visions and senseless guilt over Jean Grey's death. This nonsense only served to confuse and bog the story down and make Wolverine appear to be seriously unhinged.<br/><br/>Let-down # 5 - From my perspective, I think that Hugh Jackman (now 45) is clearly too old for his part. I notice that in close-ups he's rarely ever shot in natural light. The deep furrows in his brow give me an indication that there's plenty of stress in his life.<br/><br/>Yes. I could certainly continue slamming this $120 million production, non-stop. But I think my point has been made crystal-clear.<br/><br/>Now 13 years down the road, the Wolverine character has become as tiresome and stale as the likes of Freddy Krueger, for crying out loud!"

","From the other reviewers you likely already know how this movie is *bad*. But for those who care less about plot in a 2-hour superhero movie I can tell you how this movie is *good*.<br/><br/>(1) The acting is good. Hugh Jackman is more convincing than ever as Wolverine - through every posture and expression he shows how a physically immortal hero would age mentally and emotionally. In fact I wonder if Hugh is imparting some of his own struggles with age into this performance - He is 45, and has stated that the physical demands of the role has been more challenging than ever.<br/><br/>The predominantly Japanese supporting cast offer solid performances as well. The two girls in particular did admirable jobs with the scripts they are given especially considering they are models with very limited acting experiences (in Tao's case, none) to begin with. This movie will obviously open up opportunities in Hollywood for them.<br/><br/>(2) The action is good. If you go into this movie expecting to see the typical red-blooded Wolverine slash-and-stab action you will certainly not be disappointed. One of the action scenes especially stands out for me due to its interesting (although hardly original) location which allows for some exciting physics effects. Another scene is set in a garden, a classical action setting for Asian martial arts movies but underutilized in Western productions IMO.<br/><br/>(3) The lead characters look good.<br/><br/>The simple fact is Wolverine would not be so popular if he (as portrayed by Hugh Jackman) does not look like the bulging, sinewy beast that he is. Hugh went on a strict diet/workout routine for six months in preparation for this role and it would be a sin for the audience to not feast their eyes on the fruits of his labor. IMO.<br/><br/>The actress who plays Mariko, Tao Okamoto，cuts a willowy figure of classical Japanese beauty and yet could somehow appeal to the Western aesthetics enough to become the face of Ralph Lauren (as one of the first few Asians to achieve such a distinction). She is, simply put, gorgeous in every way.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion:<br/><br/>If you expect to watch 2 hours of gorgeous people immersing themselves with thorough professionalism into acting out an absurd, almost silly script, with plenty of solid action scenes set in the colorful background of Japan - you will end up smiling and mostly satisfied, like I was. This is a movie to watch, enjoy, and forget all within an evening - not one to be taken too seriously."
"agmoldham","5","1","4","26 August 2013"," Fairly Entertaining
","The best part of this movie is that we get to see some of Wolverine's inner demons. Unlike many action movies of 2013 it is very much a character driven movie. It does focus almost solely on the one character, but let's be grateful that it isn't all just fights and explosions!<br/><br/>The storyline of the movie is that wolverine starts to lose some of his powers. One of the problems with super heroes is that they're untouchable, so it's interesting to see how Woverine copes with being more human. <br/><br/>As ever Jackman is very watchable in the lead. the direction is also good from James Mangold. Whilst the plot isn't without faults it should be applauded for trying something a little more interesting than the standard blockbuster fayre."
"ksj870","7","1","4","16 August 2013"," The Wolverine
","A follow-up to the 2009 feature starring the eponymous hero, THE WOLVERINE is a significant improvement over that film. The sequel is better written and, despite its comic-book origins, manages to remain at least somewhat within the realm of believability. But the main factor which makes THE WOLVERINE successful is the attention to character this time around. The hero has decided he doesn't want to be a hero anymore, and the plot revolves around our protagonist's quest for a life of meaning even though he's not at all sure he wants to go on living at all.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a flashback to a Japanese prison camp in Nagasaki just before an atomic bomb decimates the whole city. An American prisoner—yes, that would be Wolverine—saves a young Japanese soldier from being killed in the conflagration. The years go by, and in the present day Wolverine receives an invitation from the Japanese soldier's family to visit him in Tokyo. The years have been kind to the former soldier, who went on to found a huge technology corporation worth millions. But now that he's dying of old age, he claims he has found a way to take Wolverine's mutant powers of healing from him. But though he's world-weary and ready to be done with life, Wolverine can't bring himself to agree to the strange offer. And so the old man dies. And that's when things start to get really interesting.<br/><br/>The story works because it not only incorporates the necessary high-level action required for a summer blockbuster, complete with ninjas, serpent-like women and huge armor-plated samurai warriors, but also due to its inherent dependence upon characterization. This time Wolverine isn't just a fighting machine with a bad attitude, but a wounded man trying to rediscover a purpose in life.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman deserves a lot of the credit for making the plot work. Jackman is eerily well-cast as the iconic Wolverine. He doesn't just look the part, but he captures all the nuances and subtleties involved in essentially becoming another person when on screen. Jackman has the strength of personality to carry the film, and he deserves even more credit or making one of Marvel's least likable super heroes into a genuinely appealing character.<br/><br/>Fans of the original X-Men movies should really enjoy THE WOLVERINE. It ties up some loose ends from that trilogy and eclipses the mediocre 2009 Wolverine film. While it's not one of the best super hero movies, it is quite good, and very much worth your time and money on a lazy Saturday afternoon."

","The Wolverine serves as a sequel to the critically panned X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Following the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, a distraught Wolverine retreats to the Canadian wilderness and leads an abject life of a wanderer. However, circumstances cause a drastic shift which places him in Tokyo, Japan. The story recounts Wolverine in unfamiliar territory, faced with precarious trials and tribulations.<br/><br/>The aforementioned premise is based loosely on Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's iconic 1982 comic book run, which finally gets the cinematic treatment. James Mangold (Walk the Line) takes the helm as director and delivers a distinctive character study of the ruthless killing machine.<br/><br/>In his sixth enactment of the fan favorite character, Hugh Jackman represents a fascinating embodiment of Wolverine. Mangold and Jackman exhibit a mutual comprehension of proceedings, excelling as a pair in delineating the vulnerable side of Wolverine. While all previous X-Men installments were ensemble driven, The Wolverine offers an alternate dynamic: a more methodical version, with character development aplenty. Once Wolverine is pushed to his physical and emotional threshold, he is compelled to confront his internal conflict. This gives viewers a chance to actually associate with the character on a more intimate level. Moreover, the isolation and agony felt by Wolverine is portrayed expertly as well.<br/><br/>While Jackman is able to carry the movie entirely on his own, he is supported adequately and admirably by Tao Okamoto, who plays his love interest Mariko and Rila Fukushima as Yukio, who is Wolverine's aide. Both actresses share a good chemistry with Jackman. The interaction between Wolverine and Yukio leads to a few humorous moments, which are a welcome addition.<br/><br/>The Wolverine represents a marked improvement compared to its predecessor. However, it is not without its own failings. First and foremost, the action sequences, which are the USP of such movies, are uninspiring. Apart from a sensational set piece atop a Japanese bullet train, the movies other altercations are monotonous and bland.<br/><br/>Since the movie is shot primarily in Australia, with some studio sets serving as substitutes for the densely populated streets of Tokyo, the cinematographer is bound by such limitations. Therefore, the illuminated sights of Japan are rarely shown. Better comic book adaptations are known as much for their villains as the heroes and in this regard The Wolverine is bereft of an imperative element. The movie contains multiple threats for the protagonist, none of whom are a memorable adversary.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the movie is prone to predictability and offers no suspense. The background score adds nothing while lackluster editing fails to do justice, especially to the action scenes as well. Also, the 3D presentation, perhaps merely a marketing gimmick by studios to earn extra revenue, does not have the desired effect. Lastly, The Wolverine also suffers from a generic and underwhelming climax.<br/><br/>Despite the extent of errors, The Wolverine has the benefit of adjusted expectations, since it follows a widely derided prequel. The depiction of a more personal tale with lower stakes works in its favor. Nonetheless, the movie lacks the cutting edge and is tantamount to nothing more than acceptable fare."
"Matt_Layden","7","1","4","5 August 2013"," The Wolverine focuses more on character than spectacle.
","After the event of Last Stand, Logan has become a loner. He lives in the wilderness with his demons. Until a young woman enters his life with news that the man Logan once saved back in WWII when the US dropped the bomb on Nagaski, has asked to see him once more. He's dying and wants to offer Logan something no one ever thought could be true. His mortality. <br/><br/>I still, to this day, wonder what this film would have been like had Aronofsky been behind the camera. Without a doubt it would have been a hard R rated spectacle with blood and violence. This Wolverine is the PG-13 version of what an R rated comic book film could be. It's violent, has harsh language and isn't set an wowing the audience, it instead has a story it wants to tell. Which is a step above what Wolverine had to go through with his origins tale and the atrocity that was Ratner's entry. <br/><br/>The Wolverine sets itself apart from the other X-Men films by focusing mainly on the setting of this tale. Logan is now in Japan, something that the comic book readers will be familiar with as Japan plays a pretty big part of Logan's history. The change in local was a welcome addition as it gives the film a breath of fresh air about it. It stands out from the crowd, this is both a blessing and a curse. Why a curse? Well, I can't help but shake the feeling that this entry was ho-hum. I love that it tells a smaller story, a more focused story, but in the grand scheme of things is kind of feels pointless. It's like a side stop to sight see while we wait to continue on with bigger things. <br/><br/>This film has a lot of issues, but nothing major that made me hate it. In fact, I liked it. This is probably one of the better entries in the series where Jackman has played this character a whopping 6 times. Here he looks leaner, meaner and more at ease with the character. Logan is haunted by his demons, mainly Jean Grey. Jackman plays the character with an emotional detachment, but also the need to belong. This character is a loner, he doesn't play well with others, but all he really wants is acceptance. Even if he says he doesn't. <br/><br/>There are only three mutants in this film. Our titled hero, a one dimensional venomous vixen by the name of Viper and a redheaded martial arts expert who can see people's deaths in the future, Yukio. Rila Fukushima who plays Yukio, does well for herself against Jackman. She was impressive considering this is her first major role. Tao Okamoto plays Mariko, sister to Yukio and the target of the Yakuza. Logan takes it upon himself to protect her...maybe even fall for her in a forced there needs to be a love story kind of way. <br/><br/>There are some twists in the film, that a child can see coming a mile away. Nothing too confusing in the plot that features assassination attempts, kidnapping, betrayal, family issues, etc. The most interesting aspect of this film is the fact that Logan has his healing power taken away from him. Now we have a guy who was once immortal (or close to) getting tired from simply chopping some wood. His healing powers are significantly slower, he bleeds, needs to see doctors and finally feels the pain. This raises the stakes for a once unstoppable character. One issues I had right away was that even with his healing powers gone, he shows no signs of pain or slowing down with his metallic claws rip through his hands. No sign of damage there. Big oversight from the filmmakers on that one. <br/><br/>The Wolverine is an interesting character study. It has one showy fight sequence on a train, that walks the line of cartoonish. It's more concerned with the fact that this guy is an animal, a loner who goes by his own rules being thrown into a society that has honour, rules and obedience at the forefront. He is out of his element and the audience is unaware they are too for the first time in this characters life. Shoddy storytelling near the end involving Logan's power makes the film end with me scratching my head. Throw onto that a ballsy move the filmmakers decide to do with Logan and you've got my interest in the next film.<br/><br/>Does it reflect badly on the film that I thought the best part of it was the after the credit sequence?"
"tolga-ismen-1","6","1","4","4 August 2013"," I do not like this Wolverine
","The action is amazing, Hugh Jackson is as always awesome. However, I am not happy with how the story developed. Mariko is so fundamental for the whole plot, yet her character development is very poor. Is she really the good girl and if yes how? She has a father that wants to kill her. Her role model and her genetic heritage (apparently) is even worse. Her mother was never mentioned. The mother is alive. She was present at the funeral but she never showed up after that. There was no stories about her. Maybe Mariko killed her grandfather not to save Logan but inherit the empire. It seems that that is the overriding motive in their family. Why it was hard for her to get friends when she was young? Sleeping with Logan was totally out of place. It was not seemed logical both for Mariko and for Logan. This felt like a classic Marvel episode in which the writers do not care too much about the plot. Generally Logan also has more character development. What was his dramatic need? He was not helping anyone for more than a year after killing Jean and now he is risking his life to save Mariko. If you want to kill your daughter will you ask the Minister of Justice of Japan (who is in his early thirties) to retain Yakuza? It does not make sense. However, my money is still well deserved just for the train scene. That was epic. I hope they will spend more time with story in the next one."
"zardoz-13","7","1","4","2 August 2013"," Wolverine De-Clawed
","Let me say up front without apology that ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" qualified as a fantastic piece of formulaic fodder. Before I saw director James Mangold's ""The Wolverine,"" I watched ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" again and wondered how anybody could top such a tour-de-force tale. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" boasted everything that a blockbuster movie requires: charismatic heroes, wicked villains both human and mutant, larger-than-life spectacle, tearful romance, treacherous betrayal, and histrionic revenge. During its first weekend, this Marvel mutant masterpiece coined over $85 million. Ultimately, it grossed $373 million globally. Comparatively, ""The Wolverine"" raked in only $55 million during its first weekend. Analysts had predicted $70 million. Not surprisingly, ""The Wolverine"" isn't half as entertaining as ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" Although James Mangold is a gifted director, ""The Wolverine"" ranks well below his other epics. He directed the brilliant Johnny Cash & June Carter biopic ""I Walk the Line,"" the complex Sylvester Stallone crime drama ""Copland,"" the gritty western remake ""3:10 to Yuma"" with Russell Crowe & Christian Bale, the aggressive Tom Cruise actioneer ""Knight and Day,"" and the critically acclaimed chick flick ""Girl, Interrupted."" Mangold isn't a high-profile, Oscar winning, celebrity director whose name sells tickets like Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg, and James Cameron. Capable and competent, Mangold has proved to be only as good as his material. This above-average but uneven Twentieth Century Fox release suffers from undistinguished villains who make little impression and a synthetic storyline that stalls out several times during its indulgent 129-minute running time. Mangold excels when depicting the Wolverine's woes. Unfortunately, scenarists Mark Bomback of ""Unstoppable"" and Scott Frank of ""Minority Report"" have concocted a pedestrian yarn that doesn't broaden our knowledge of the protagonist. Despite its polished production values, the anti-climatic ""The Wolverine"" comes up short as a seminal superhero saga.<br/><br/>Ostensibly, Bomback and Frank adapted Marvel's limited run series ""Wolverine"" written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Frank Miller back in 1982. Apparently, neither Bomback nor Frank fretted about fidelity to the source material. They've changed several things, including Logan's decision to visit Japan. As it turns out, ""The Wolverine"" is a sequel to ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" not ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" The opening thirty minutes differ from the limited series comic book. First, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen of ""GoldenEye"") keeps invading Logan's dreams. (If you're hoping Jean Grey will play an integral role in ""The Wolverine,"" prepare to be sorely disappointed. She appears just as suddenly as she vanishes and then keeps on annoying Logan one time too often. While the ""Wolverine"" limited run series mentioned Jean Grey, Scott 'Cyclops' Summers worried more about her than Logan. Second, Wolverine is camping in the woods and grieving over Jean's death when he encounters a huge bear. Later, a hunter shoots this bear with a poisonous arrow but doesn't kill it. In the comic, Wolverine plunges into the bear's den to kill it after it has slain several people. In ""The Wolverine,"" he finds the poor bear and puts it out of its misery before heading off to confront the hunter. Third, unlike Bomback and Frank, Claremont and Miller didn't knit World War II, Nagasaki, and Wolverine's saving an enemy officer into their narrative.<br/><br/>""The Wolverine"" unfolds on the historic day when America dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945. The Japanese military maintain a prison camp across the bay from the city. The Wolverine, Logan (Hugh Jackman with his signature mutton-chops), is sweating it out in solitary confinement when the atomic bomb falls. (In ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" you saw Wolverine participate in the American Civil War, World War I, World War II in Europe, and The Vietnam War. Evidently, our hero must have volunteered for action in the Pacific as he helped vanquish the Nazis in Europe.) Anyhow, Logan saves Japanese prison camp officer, Yashida (Ken Yamamura), after his three superiors have committed ritual suicide. Miraculously, Yashida and Wolverine both survive the horrific blast. The Wolverine looks like a scorched pepperoni pizza after exposure to the blast. Our hero's regenerative powers, however, enable him to heal himself completely without a scratch. Yashida escaped certain death through the Wolverine's intervention. The prison camp officer emerges with a scar on his face as a testament to his presence at the blast.<br/><br/>In the film, years after Nagasaki, an elderly Yashida struggles against all hope on his death bed. He has a brilliant doctor named Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkov) who is keeping him alive. Yashida is the mastermind behind an internationally profitable electronics empire. He dispatches his daughter's friend to find the Wolverine. The agile, sword-wielding wrath, Yukio (Rila Fukushima), tracks the Wolverine down to a tavern of Canada as he is about to kill the bear hunter. Meantime, the comic followed a different path. After he settled up with the hunter in the bar, Wolverine winged his way off to Japan because his girlfriend Mariko had stopped talking to him. When he arrived in the Land of the Rising Sun, Wolverine discovered that Mariko wanted nothing to do with him. Mariko's gangster father Lord Shingen has come back into her life. Moreover, Shingen has forced her to marry another man so her father can dominate the Japanese Underworld. At this point, Wolverine found himself up to his ears in Yakuza. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Logan for the sixth time. He delivers an absorbing performance as the tortured but sympathetic X-Man. Literally, the Wolverine is the only well-rounded character in this half-baked actioneer. Meantime, the villainous Yashida emerges as a lackluster adversary who only wants to prolong his life at Logan's expense. In the long run, the beautiful but bland Viper proves to be more deceptive than destructive. In the limited run series, all the X-Men showed up for our hero's triumphant return. Mangold and his scribes make their worse mistake when they pit Logan against an army of villains that cannot hold their own in combat with our hero and his razor-sharp, adamantium claws."

I believe if you are going to do a fight scene then you should film it and not ""fake it"" but shaking the camera and making lots of fast cuts, that is taking the easy way out and best left to home movies.<br/><br/>The good of this movie is there is some more history of Wolverine past that helps build the Wolverine character for the next movie.

"chikorita202","7","1","4","29 July 2013"," Dark, gritty and better than the predecessor.
","The most popular and favorite mutant, Wolverine comes back with his second solo film, The Wolverine. Played by Hugh Jackman again, it's his sixth time playing Logan. (which includes his five second badass cameo in X-Men: First Class)<br/><br/>The movie is loosely based on the limited series Wolverine (1982) comic by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. The story begins after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand. Now, an unshaven and an unkempt Logan living in a forest away from the world, battles with himself after Jean Grey's (Famke Janssen) death. Troubled by her nightmares, he faces even more danger when he journey's to Tokyo to meet an old acquaintance, Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), the owner of a multi-million technology company with Yukio (Rila Fukushima), an expert swordsmen and who can foretell a person's death. As the story proceeds we find him for the first time vulnerable surrounded in a different city by the Yakuza and ninjas.<br/><br/>In the first fifteen minutes, the unkempt Logan looks unfamiliar, but after a brief funny scene before his meeting with the dying Yashida, we find the Logan we know of. Compared to his last solo film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine which was average, The Wolverine comes out fresh and improved. It is now darker and brutal. Don't expect a light film like the previous X-Men movies. What makes the movie darker is Logan himself with his own haunted story to be mortal again and thereby wanting to join Jean in the afterlife. The fighting sequences are more brutal. And that's the best part of the movie. Watch out for the adrenaline rushing bullet train fighting sequence which is one of the best scenes in this two hour film. The makers have converted the 'typical train fighting sequence' into something completely new, thrilling and very fast paced like a bullet.<br/><br/>There are far less mutants, only Wolverine and Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova). But that is what makes the movie what it is. Concentrating only on Logan's character, the soldier's efforts to save Mariko, the grand-daughter of Yashida (Tao Okamoto) the film proves to be dark, sometimes silent, and entertaining with a few laughs here and there. Viper is a good addition to the film with her slithering powers threatening the very existence of Logan.<br/><br/>Overall, The Wolverine comes out as a good second solo movie. Although the movie does feel empty, fans will appreciate it and non-fans will be happy by Hugh Jackman's performance as a gritty and vulnerable mutant who is no more immortal. Don't forget to miss the exciting after credit scene which will make fans go gaga."

And finally we can go home.<br/><br/>Sitting through the movie, my unstimulated mind couldn't help but wander to another analogy. Think of this installment as a movement in a concerto, where the tempo is andante, moving so much more slowly than the rest of the pieces. As part of the X-franchise as a whole, it needed more action, less bland dialog, and honestly, just the thrill that we expected of watching a mass of superheroes and supervillains go at it with their superpowers.<br/><br/>I get the attempt in a trend of making superheroes more grounded, but The Dark Night this film is not.

","What could've been a great R-Rated standalone Wolverine feature, turns into just another Marvel episode around the third act.<br/><br/>For the first act it looked pretty good, I was expecting to give it 4/5, I was really interested in the philosophical themes the movie was dealing with, it wasn't just another Wolverine movie, it felt like I was up for a lonely samurai badass Wolverine, similar to ""The Punisher"".<br/><br/>Then came the second act, it felt as if Darren Aronofsky had stayed on and directed scenes in it, specially the scenes with a mentally unstable Wolverine and the excessive violence that had me wondering why there were any kids in the theater. Still, it was easy to see that James Mangold was a great replacement, he can handle both action and drama, which was the perfect mix this movie needed.<br/><br/>For the second act I was expecting to give it 4.5/5, I felt like I was watching a great superhero film, similar to my experience with ""Watchmen"", it seemed perfect right up to there. I kept on admiring the choreography of the fight scenes, something hard to find in modern action movies where all we can see is just CGI robots or aliens. The only action movie to come out this year where I truly admired its action sequences was ""Fast & Furious 6"".<br/><br/>Finally came the third act, which felt as if some studio executive came and started messing with the whole story to make it just another Marvel episode, similar to what The Avengers series does. Not only did they do that, but they scrapped so much of the story from the first two acts that everything stopped making sense. *spoiler* I'm talking about the archer who is praying at Yashido's funeral, promising him that he will take care of Mariko, his granddaughter, but then during the third act its revealed that Yashido was alive all along and was the bad guy everyone was working for, including this archer guy I'm talking about who when we first met was praying to a guy he already knew wasn't dead. Can somebody explain how that is supposed to make sense? *spoiler* Alright so by the third act which is when all these dumb plot holes started I was ready to lower my grade, but had I rated the third act apart from the other two I'd probably give it 1.5/5.<br/><br/>Could've this been a lot better had Darren Aronofsky directed it? Maybe, maybe not. I don't like the way he handles action (see ""The Fountain"") and not only that, he wouldn't had let there be any comic relief which is something ""The Wolverine"" typically does (specially in this movie, but in a good way). I would've liked it more than this one, thats for sure, I know he wouldn't have let studio executives control his third act after working on it for such a long time, and I would've loved seeing an R-Rated version of ""The Wolverine"", there were so many violent scenes in this were I would've liked seeing the off-screen outcome of the villains that the Wolverine attacks.<br/><br/>For recommending this movie, I'm going to have to separate the first two acts from the third. I'd recommend the first two acts to anyone who liked ""Black Swan"", ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol"", ""X-Men: First Class"", ""X2: X-Men United"", and/or ""13 Assassins"". I'd recommend the third act to anyone who liked ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", and/or ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""."

","Wolverine is the 6th installment of X-men series with Hugh Jackman reviving his role as the title character. Loosely adapted from the famous Japanese arc by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, characters are more or less different from the original comics particularly Silver Samurai and Viper.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Wolverine is shown living a secluded life, somewhere in northern America, over the guilt of killing Jean Grey (in The Last Stand). He is approached by a mysterious Japanese girl, Yukio, who wants to take him with her to Japan. As the plot unfolds, it's Yukio's boss Yashida who wants to meet Wolverine. Half a century back, Wolverine saved Yashida's life during Nagasaki nuclear tragedy. As a token of appreciation, Yashida wants to give Wolverine back his ""Mortality"" - a thing Wolverine craves most. However, Yashida dies unexpectedly and this sets into motion a chain of unexpected events involving her Grand-daughter Mariko (also his company's heir).<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is darker than previous X-Men movies and appears more mature. GIven the original story-line was too big to be scaled down in a single movie, the script is quite decent. But it lacks the action we want from a X-men movie. Hugh Jackman as the central character gives an excellent performance. However,some parts of the movie needed more character development.<br/><br/>Gorgeous Svetlana, as Viper, is shown as the main antagonist for most part of the movie. However, her lack of screen time leaves us unsatisfied. Changing the original comic story by making Viper a mutant is useless, if you don't want her to fight like one. Wolverine and Viper are not seen dueling much on screen and that's a bone of contention for me. Also, if Wolverine and Mariko were given more time together, their bond could have been explained better. Finally, I didn't like the finale as it wasn't as exciting as the Bullet Train fight sequence, or the funeral massacre. <br/><br/>The Wolverine is a good installment for the X-men series raising the bar of X-men standard/theme. But it doesn't quite make it to the top of my list. X2 still remains my favorite, followed by First Class."

","First let me say that I didn't read any of the comics or watch any of the X-Men related shows. However I did see almost all the Marvel-related comic book movies, including everything X-Men. It seems this movie just falls short. I did somewhat enjoy this one but ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was executed better. The story doesn't seem to evolve in the X-Men universe, at least not very much. I won't give anything away. I was expecting something different, although I was somewhat entertained. I look forward to the addition to the X-Men universe and hopefully better and more relatable stories in those movies."

","Terrible movie, quite as bad as the latest 3 or 4 in the X-Men series. Seems that Superheroes movies have nothing to say anymore. Apart from the train scene which is quite decent, everything is lame in this movie.<br/><br/>I read a review saying that the F. word was used only once to avoid the R rating. It's a shame that writers are trying to avoid that kind of mistake but are encouraged to make horrible scenes recalling WW2 in a very non historic manner which is unbearable to me Just to make things clear : there was certainly no POW camp in Nagasaki. Logan could't have known about Fat Boy just because he heard and saw a B52. Anyways, he couldn't event have seen the B52 ( there was only 1 to drop the bomb ) because if the plane launched the bomb from only a few thousand feet as in the movie, it would have been blown away immediately. Instead the B52 cruised above 30 thousand feet. The bomb did not explode when reaching the soil but about 3000 feet above ground. Furthermore, I doubt there were many Japanese soldiers that freed their American prisoners upon getting beaten so all of this is plain pointless.<br/><br/>I know this is only to make a movie but to me this is very bad movie-making, and I'm not speaking about the rest of the movie which is even worse.<br/><br/>I was a huge fan of Wolverine in the series debut in 2000 but now it seems that Mr Jackman is screened only to be seen growling around and looking bad-ass without a purpose.<br/><br/>Stick to Bryan Singer's original X-Men which was an intelligent movie ( as well as bad-ass ), and X-Men 2 which was quite decent.

","This is by far the most disappointing movies or (sequels or prequels) I have even seen. There is not even a hint of the X-men trilogies. All the superhero, super gifted, mutants vs. humans, action scenes etc. are all left out of this film. Making it a horribly boring movie where ""wolverine"" is just trying to save a girl from being killed for her inheritance. Oh yeah and he has lost his abilities to heal which is boring as hell. This movie sucks from start to finish. I can't believe I was waiting for months to see this. It's as bad as The Matrix 2, actually it's worse if that's possible. I have to write 10 lines so I guess I'll add that the movie taking place in Japan didn't work at all nor did the flashbacks of his relationship with Jean from X-men 1-3. And the lack of powers from anyone but Wolverine, a villain that spits green stuff and a girl that can see not the whole future but can just see when people die..? Please that is not a power."

","It was bad enough cringing through Tom Cruise as THE LAST SAMURAI in 2003, but THE WOLVERINE just takes the cake for Kow-Towing to the continent of Asia just because it has more people than the land masses wherein English is spoken, and just because they've purchased most of America's institutions (including Hollywood), and just because they might buy more movie tickets for THE WOLVERINE (if you count sales for dubbed and subtitled versions). But please Louise, next thing you know we'll be hearing that Japan WON WWII. Of course, if you watch this flick and read between the lines, you'll probably be coming out of the multiplex thinking that they DID. After seeing Wolverine's earlier films, it's clear that his origin story should be taking place during a time period such as the American Civil War. To say that an American super hero was created by Americans nuking a P.O.W. camp full of Americans is the height of absurdity. It almost sounds like something you would read in one of those mindless comic books, if they still came with captions!"

Yet another moronic script that appears to have been written with by a committee made up of people how cannot communicate properly There was a singular lack of originality as there were a lot of it re-hashed ideas from earlier X-Men series. The ending was so predictable it beggars belief that the film industry still turns out such insulting rubbish.<br/><br/>Obvious idiocies.<br/><br/>How would Wolverine know anything about the Nagasaki nuclear bomb if he had been in that pit.<br/><br/>Yashida would almost certainly have been permanently blinded by the nuclear flash.<br/><br/>The idea that security would be so bad that such a large number of 'baddies' would be at the funeral is an insult to anyone with a brain. Surely Wolverine would not be the only person to notice those tattoos. Ditto re Harada on the roof.<br/><br/>The scene on the top of the bullet train was just silly and totally unbelievable.<br/><br/>How did the baddies find Mariko again and why didn't Wolverine slash the car tyres instead of grabbing a baddie? How can he go from seemingly being smarter than a whole security team (at the funeral) to being so dumb? When the ninjas harpooned him at the village below the mountain research facility I nearly laughed out load. What sort of cretin thought that made any sense? Also how did Yukio get past the ninja guards a few minutes later? I am sick of such idiotic films."
"ticket_for_one","5","1","5","1 August 2013"," Wolverine represents, the film doesn't
","I went into The Wolverine screening with low expectations. The trailers released two months before the film, did nothing for me. And now that I've seen The Wolverine, it still hasn't done anything for me. The film has a load of problems in regards to its pacing, performances and story. A lot happens in this film, but it's not a lot I'd care to mention. What does stand out is Jackman's performance as Wolverine. He's fantastic in this film.<br/><br/>This is Jackman's sixth outing as the X-Man and without a doubt his best. This time we see a more vulnerable Wolverine (without healing factor), battling to come to terms with Jean Grey's death. Jean (Famke Janssen) enters his dreams haunting Wolverine over her death in the last X-Men movie (X-Men The Last Stand that is, not X-Men First Class). These scenes above everything else in the film show a lot more depth to the Wolverine character and making him more human. Jackman, who looks an absolute beast (excuse the pun) , has said that he feels this is the best he's ever played the character and it's clearly evident with his acting and the presence he exudes in this film.<br/><br/>Supporting cast, do well to aid Jackman. The often brilliant Hiroyuki Sanada adds weight to the film as one of Wolverine's adversaries. Tao Okamoto does well as Mariko, playing the damsel in distress role as well as Wolverine's main love interest, without the chemistry I might add. Will Yun Lee is OK, no seriously he was just that. To be honest I found his character's inclusion quite unnecessary, because he did little else apart from throw arrows around the place. Rila Fukushima is excellent as Yukio and is second to Jackman's performance. Not only was she adept at the fight scenes, she conveyed the right emotion when needed and had better chemistry with Jackman.<br/><br/>The main villain is absolutely tragic in this. Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) a character from comics, from Wolverine's days as his alias 'Patch' in Madripoor. Pops up as an evil geneticist or a physiologist (one of the two) and does absolutely nothing in this, but model a green bondage suit and hiss and sneer a lot. I couldn't believe she was the main antagonist in this film. She was terrible! And this only adds to the few problems with The Wolverine.<br/><br/>Let's start with story, because The Wolverine doesn't really have one. Our hero ends up in Japan, to help an old man, he knew from his days as a prisoner in World War 2.Then, all hell breaks loose. Yakuza gangs are thrown into the mix, there's an impressive high speed train fight, with Wolverine fighting some Yakuza thug on top of a bullet train going 300 mph. There are ninjas flying around left, right and centre. An effects laden bore fest of a fight between Wolverine and The Silver Samurai. And last, but not least, a poor pathetic small twist thrown in at the end, for the cinema's audience to gasp at. And to be totally honest, I saw it coming a mile away. The action set pieces are solid and well filmed. The bits between are boring and drag this film almost off a cliff.<br/><br/>James Mangold is a solid director. 3:10 To Yuma, Walk the Line, Cop Land, all great films, showing what a talent he is as a director. Mangold does a great job letting you know we are in Japan. And he expands on that by showing the culture and history of the Japanese people. From the bombing of Nagasaki to the Japan we know of today. Unfortunately, The Wolverine's pacing and narrative runs out of steam, especially right at the end, when the film needed a dazzling finale to finish on. Overall, it felt as if Wolverine landed in Japan and found he was in a world of trouble. And in order to get out of the mess he's in, he picks a fight with the robotic version of the Silver Samurai. The Wolverine is an improvement on its predecessor. But it's equal in its disappointment at not providing very much of a story to keep me interested.<br/><br/>The film has already made $121 mil at the US box office, surpassing its $100 mil budget. Will it equal or surpass the dreadful juggernaut that is Iron Man 3 in worldwide takings? I doubt it. But it could mean that another Wolverine movie is on the way. Is this worth a watch in the cinema? It is, but avoid the 3D viewings. The glasses did absolutely nothing to enhance my enjoyment of this poor sequel. Oh, and stay at the end for another Marvel end scene before the main credits. You'll love it! You'll probably love it more than this entire film."

I fear it may be the last standalone Wolverine movie Jackman will star in, which is depressing."
"blazing-wind","6","1","5","31 July 2013"," Extremely unrealistic and cliché
","When the Wolverine was announced to take place in Japan, there was a lot of potential to the storyline, Japan is a gem in East with beautiful scenery, a strong culture and unique history. If going to Japan for the protagonist was to seek redemption, find purpose, and to reinvent himself was the main focus of the movie, then maybe the movie would of been a lot better. Instead the direction of the movie is based on one dimensional characters, unrealistic story line and cliché fight scenes.<br/><br/>There is no character development for any of the characters therefore you don't give a sh!T about them. For example !SPOILERS! during one scene where Yashida explains to Logan that his granddaughter ""Mariko"" is his most valuable treasure and must be protected. Yet it never explains why or goes in depth to the connection between them. It doesn't explain why he neglects his son ""Shingen"" who seem to be so much more useful than the granddaughter. Also the romance between Logan and Mariko is a joke, there was no need for it. Its ridiculous that she would go against her grandfather and her childhood lover ""Sanada"" for a person she met in matter of days. Sanada's character is even more ridiculous, from being a black ninja loyal to Yashida, he suddenly changes his mind near the end of the movie for absolutely no reason and is killed by the giant mech samurai. <br/><br/>Logan does not go through any spiritual transformation or encounter anything from the culture that would help him reinvent himself other than the fact he got laid. The director did not put any emphasis on the Japanese culture. The way of the samurai was not put in to focus at all. <br/><br/>Although it is an Xmen movie, there is literately 2 mutants in the entire film. You have Logan and the viper, this could of been a film about the Yakuza or ninjas and you wouldn't even notice the difference. <br/><br/>The movie is very inconsistent in a lot of aspects, for example the adamantium claws wolverine has can rip through metal walls like cutting butter yet he couldn't cut through stainless steel samurai swords? Also in the marvel universe adamantium is extremely rare, in Xmen origins it established that adamantium came from space, so where on earth did Yashida find that much adamantium to build a giant mech? But the film never offers any sort of clarification or explanation to this. <br/><br/>The movie has many similarities to the ""Last Samurai"", they were both westerners traveling to Japan, both have lost purpose in life, and both have been haunted by their past. Yet the elements presented in the Last Samurai that made it a good movie was non existent in the Wolverine. Towards the end of the Wolverine you wish he had just said yes to Yashida's offer and died therefore sparing you from this <br/><br/>Overall the movie isn't the worst Xmen film, but X-men first class has set the bar quite high and this definitely does not live up to expectations."

Logan travels to Japan, but something happens, that Logan gets caught up in the mix.<br/><br/>A little better than the last Wolverine movie, it has an effected story, and Hugh Jackman is always good as Logan/Wolverine. Action scenes are pretty good and quite intense. But the film does slow down, but then it got to the point where it was boring, but when it picks up, it really picks up. Japan setting was beautifully well shot. A flawed, but entertaining Wolverine film."
"MBunge","5","1","5","29 July 2013"," I feel sorry for Hugh Jackman
","The Wolverine is one of the better made super-hero flicks of its era. Screenwriters Mark Bomback and Scott Frank have come up with a story that's better than Spider-Man 1 or 3, Iron Man 2 or 3, either Hulk movie and both Captain America and Thor combined. Director James Mangold also does fine work, though many of the action scenes suffer from the modern blight of camera movement that's so frenetic you can barely tell who is hitting whom. The special effects are solid and even the soundtrack is well done. And the cast, highlighted by the tremendous Hugh Jackman, is as appealing as you'll find. There's almost every ingredient here you need to make a great motion picture. The one thing missing, however, is so important that it negates almost everything positive.<br/><br/>Wolverine is not a great character. Yes, I know. He's the most popular comic book creation of the last 40 years and has joined, if not surpassed, Batman, Superman and Spider-Man in the hearts of super-hero fans. That's still doesn't change the fact that he's not a great character. Or to be more accurate, that's he's only a great character in the limited role for which he was originally conceived. Wolverine was created to be a one-off opponent for the Hulk and then was hauled out of mothballs to join a revamped X-Men roster and as a rebel anti-hero in opposition to or operating alongside more traditional heroic types, Logan is a whole lot of fun. On his own as the emotional and narrative heart of a story, he's a whole lot of one-note nothing.<br/><br/>Wolverine is nothing more than adolescent badassery given form. He has none of the natural depth of Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne. Those characters are enmeshed with bigger concepts like responsibility, guilt, compulsion and myriad other things. Wolverine is about nothing more than looking, talking and acting ""cool"" and every attempt to graft more onto him ultimately fails. This film ambitiously tries to build off both Logan's sense of loss from killing Jean Grey in X-Men: The Last Stand and his weariness over decades of battle-torn existence to give him some pathos, then strips him of his healing factor to try and make him slightly vulnerable. But adolescent badassery and vulnerability never mix and by the end of the movie, Logan is back to getting skewered through the chest by a katana and shrugging it off like it was a splinter. The super power that originally meant he could recover from a non-fatal gunshot in a day has metastasized into every boy's fantasy of never being hurt by anything.<br/><br/>And if you think I'm wrong, ask yourself this. What are the best Wolverine moments on the big screen. They're all from the first two X-flicks, aren't they? Moments when he may have been the star but shared the screen and story with others. Or why did they need to go back to a 4 issue limited series from 30 years ago for the guts of this motion picture? No one wrote a Wolvie story-arc in the last 20 years that was good enough for the job?<br/><br/>In many respects, this movie helps to solidify the standard of quality by which the whole genre should be judged. It really is that good in so many ways. But just because a comic book character is popular, that doesn't mean he or she can carry an entire film."
"oldwannabe","7","1","5","26 July 2013"," Solid movie, and Rila Fukushima is the best thing about it
","This is a pretty solid adaptation of the classic 1982 Chris Claremont/Frank Miller comic miniseries that told Wolverine's first solo adventure outside of the X-Men books. At times James Mangold's direction feels uneven, and even drags in certain places. But overall it's an enjoyable ride.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film, aside from Hugh Jackman's usual solid turn, is newcomer Rila Fukushima as the swordswoman Yukio. From what I've read, this is her first movie after a career as a fashion model. She's definitely got great screen presence, and she also has a really unique look. Look for her to give Rinko Kikuchi a run for her money as Hollywood's go-to ""Japanese female"" actress.<br/><br/>The worst thing about the film is that it follows in the Hollywood tradition of all the pretty Asian ladies being threatened and oppressed by all the evil Asian men around them...until the brave, noble, handsome white guy comes to save the day while making all those pretty Asian ladies swoon. *Sigh* It's 2013!!! Yeah, I know. I myself pointed out that the movie is an adaptation of a story from the early 80's. It wouldn't be so bad if pretty much EVERY Hollywood film set in Asia didn't follow that same tired supremacist formula. And this movie doesn't exist in a vacuum.<br/><br/>Still, for what it's worth, ""The Wolverine"" is an entertaining film. Compared to all the other summer movie offerings this year (2013), it's worth your money. If anything, see it for Rila Fukushima. She's great, and she's going to be a star."

","This movie was sort of heading in the right direction until the Silver Samurai turned out to be a robot. In the 4 issue mini-series, Wolverine and theSilver Samurai had an epic battle which would have been great to see in the movie. Not to mention that the Silver Samurai is a mutant who has the power to generate an energy field manifested through his katana. How sad this could not have been portrayed accurately in the movie. Instead of the epic no quarter given battle that was expected to be between the Silver Samurai and Wolverine, we are left with...Wolverine vs Mariko's father and then Wolverine vs the ""dead"" grandfather? Wolverine never had his claws cut off in the mini-series by the Silver Samurai, and the Silver Samurai was always himself, not some robot/old man who wanted to suck out his healing powers. These deviations may seem minor, but to the fans who collected the comics and followed the X-Men and Wolverine growing up, you did us a huge injustice. This movie could have been done so much better. At least Yukio was pretty much right on and Mariko was pretty."

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","6","28 July 2013"," A movie as boring as its title.
","The key problem with ""The Wolverine"", the latest comic book adaptation from Marvel Studios, is that it tries to delve into the psychology and haunted life of a character that is not all that interesting to begin with. Unlike his fellow X-Men, like Storm or Cyclops or Rogue, Wolverine is kind of blah as a superhero. He has a body made of a substance that regenerates itself when he gets hurt and his knuckles extend into long silver claws. His personality is made up of grouchy indifference and occasional fits of rage to which those claws come in handy. Outside of that, there really isn't much there.<br/><br/>This is not the fault of Hugh Jackman who, in this movie, occupies the role for the sixth time. He's a good actor and he does infuse this character with a bit of sympathy when he's not snarling or bearing his claws. But so far in this series, he hasn't been given much to work with. Unlike the previous entry in the series ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" director James Mangold slows down the action to build a story around him and it only further proves that this character, in his own stand-alone story, just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Taking place sometime after ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" we catch up with Wolverine (who also goes by the name Logan) who has retreated into a Grizzly Adams-type refuge in the Canadian wilderness. After a pointless encounter involving a grizzly bear, Logan is recruited to fly to Japan to bid sayonara to Mariko, a man he saved back during World War II. The man is lying on his deathbed, but WHAT a deathbed! It's a neat device that resembles one of those strange mesh 3D pin art things that you buy for your desk. The pins raise and lower the patient almost independently, which is really a sight to see. It's probably the most effective visual in the film.<br/><br/>Anyway, the old man was saved by Wolverine back in WWII and is now the head of a multi-billion dollar global enterprise. The fact that he knew Logan back during the war apparently means that Wolverine's body has rendered him immortal, but the movie never lets us know exactly how old he is, nor do we get any insights into the journey through history that he has experienced. He was present in Japan when the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and saved the man who has now called him to his bedside, but the historical journey is left for us to imagine.<br/><br/>The plot gets underway when Wolverine is slipped a drug that slowly but surely causes his body to revert back to a mortal state. That's interesting enough, but we also have to suffer through a long, labored, boring plot about who will inherit the old man's fortune and why the old man was so interested in Wolverine's special physiology. The old man's daughter is kidnapped and there's some nonsense about honor and secret ninja armies.<br/><br/>The dialogue is straight-forward, only existing to push the plot along. The action scene are dull save for one amusing scene atop a bullet train. Other than that, this is a fairly routine movie wrapped around a character that it is difficult to care about. There are some interesting supporting players such as a Japanese psychic who tags along with Wolverine. She has an odd, angular face and a shock of barn-red hair, making her look like something out of anime. Then there's a blonde dragon-lady who calls herself The Viper. Neither of these characters have much definition except in their connection with the hero. They, much like the movie, are just so . . . so what.<br/><br/>Since this is a Marvel Studios production, there must be a preview for the next movie during the credits, and this one provides a doozy. A couple of familiar characters show up, making you wish they'd been around to liven things up for the last two hours.<br/><br/>** (of four)"

","Well let me start with The Wolverine himself he feels tremendously underpowered for his standards even in the second half of the movie you will know what i mean when you see the movie!He feels like a Pomeranian puppy to say the least! Now does it feel like an x-men movie? Well the simple answer will be NO! Few mutants just 3 that i can count and a dead one of-course!No character context for the villains at all!The villains feel half done!Forget about context there is not enough content also and its pretty damn short! The CG now! Well The CG was OK but not impressive at all and felt cheesy! The Story was guy meets girl, girl gets kidnapped and guy goes to save girl and saves her! Man a 14 year old will be able to write a better story! I don't Know why people are preferring this movie over the X-Men Origins one! That movie may have its shortcomings but It showed us a Very powerful mutant we all know ""THE WOLVERINE"" and it had many other interesting Mutant characters also and it felt like an X-men movie!"

","This was not as good as I thought it could be. The story was way too slow for your typical comic movie. I feel that the movie will not appeal to younger audiences as they will loose interest early in the movie. I biggest problem with the movie in my opinion was the lack of adventure compared to other movies involving Wolverine. There also wasn't very much comic relief that is usually in these movies. I felt it was more of a love story than an action movie. There are not very many mutants in the movie. A real downer, in my opinion. Many of the big stuff that were in this story I felt were not good for the storyline. There aren't very many mutants, and the ones there are weren't very important to the story. If you do go see the movie stay around for the credits there is stuff to see during the credits. I just felt the writing did not live up to other movies with Wolverine. This story had a good idea poorly executed."

","In a brief preamble, we discover that mutant Logan, held prisoner in Nagasaki during World War II, saves the life of Japanese guard Yashida when the atomic bomb is dropped. Years later, while Logan is having extreme difficulty in coming to terms with his having killed the woman he loves, the now wealthy Yashida summons Logan to bid him farewell as he is dying. But Yashida has other motives...<br/><br/>Much of this movie will be a puzzle to anyone who has not watched X-Men 3 or Wolverine's Origins movie - who is this woman in Logan's dreams? How come he has claws, and heals so fast? How come he was in WWII and is still alive without ageing now? But who cares - I know, that's why I went to see it! And I expect you do, too.<br/><br/>The Wolverine origin movie didn't go down that well, although I enjoyed it. This one feels totally different - the Japanese setting comes through very strongly - and is much more clearly structured to belong within the X-Men movie universe continuity (not least by way of the mid-credits teaser). I enjoyed this one, too, with two mild caveats. One, I felt that there was, if anything, too much action: there wee times when lengthy action sequences followed one after the other without advancing the (fairly sketchy) plot one step further. And, two, in a serious movie, there were a couple of times when I felt like laughing.<br/><br/>Jackman retains the physicality and intensity which has characterised Logan's 5 previous appearances. Harukiko Yamanouchi is an imposing older Yashida: the other Japanese male actors were less impressive. Svetlana Khodchenkova never really convinced as Viper but Rila Fukushima, in her first feature, was excellent as Yukio: physically very able, sexy, funny and dark - an extremely accomplished feature debut. And Tao Okamoto as the iconic Mariko was, I thought, perfect. Her character's development arc probably covers most ground (after Logan) as Mariko teaches him how to value being alive again, and does so with a centre of serene intensity.<br/><br/>The obligatory stand-alone F-bomb doesn't even have the virtue of being amusing like the one in X-Men: First Class. It really annoys me that it seems to be seen as essential to include one ""just because we can."""
"BernardGT","5","1","7","28 July 2013"," There still can't get it right!
","While it embarks a different path by distancing itself from the disastrous origin movie, this new Logan adventure is equally abysmal with its plot. While it is difficult to rank where this movie stands among the entire whole X-Men universe, one thing for sure is that it improves marginally over the 2009 movie but that is not entirely great news. The refreshing setup in the Land of Rising Sun is intriguing enough as it envisions an epic battle between Wolverine and Silver Samurai in the climax. <br/><br/>However, the plot is all too familiar, weak and pointless. The struggle of the titular character over his abilities is portrayed in the similar generic question of whether these are the gift or the curse – probably Hollywood will need new ideas after this. It is not like we have not seen it before because The Wolverine follows the exact same textbook in the chapter about story. The plot is also very predictable from end-to- end, occasionally illogical and unnecessary, while there are also plenty of side stories that are not closed properly. The writers somehow fail to give much satisfying or proper explanations to some of it. For instance, we will never truly comprehend the motivations of the main villain (which I find his excuses as lame) or how it is even possible that adamantium claws can be cut (mind you, this metal is as superior as vibranium, yet it cuts like nobody's business). The third act is a major hubris in providing a good climatic comic book action, for reasons I find it puzzling enough and this comes to show they still cannot get Wolverine right as a standalone movie package.<br/><br/>In addition to the flaws on the plot, the movie also lacks in key character development. Probably because it is a movie about Wolverine, but it does not necessary mean that most of the characters are stripped down to thin-wafer identity. Yes, this is still the Wolverine we loved and Hugh Jackman nails the character as he always does. Even if there are some developments on the Japanese characters, mostly are done with hollow rounds of emotion attached to it. Shingen Yashida whose role supposed to be big is nothing more than a douche-dad. Viper has zero development. Yukio becomes the unwanted sidekick while the biggest disappointment of all has to be Kenuichio Harada whose also supposedly big role is gutted down to a poster boy behind the relationship between Wolverine and Mariko. Speaking of which, the romantic relationship between Wolverine and Mariko Yashida is very weird and unnatural. <br/><br/>The Wolverine is one of the few movies that make me go berserk because they simply destroyed the movie as much as possible and the hype it builds. The only thing I find it exceptionally good is some of the action sequences although they mostly are bloodless and comes way too short to satisfaction. Got to admit, the bullet train scene is engaging, and the same can be said when Yukio battles Shingen in a samurai- swashbuckling scene. Otherwise, they are not inventive enough yet arrive at the right moment when we want one.<br/><br/>In the end, The Wolverine is a sub-par and generic comic book movie that finds itself the burden to outdo its predecessor way to heavy. The faults in the plot are that it is incredibly cliché, pointless and illogical all combined to top with the absolute lack in character and emotional developments."
"gokussj00","5","1","7","27 July 2013"," A fun to watch movie, nothing more
","I really like the wolverine as a character and Hugh Jackman once again plays his role perfectly. The problem was that he was the only interesting character in this movie. <br/><br/>Unlike the first wolverine movie where there were many interesting characters like his brother, Victor Creed, this movie had none except for the wolverine himself. Moreover, no other character really had a big role or had true influence on the movie which made it a bit dull unlike the first movie where there were Victor and Stryker, each with a lot of influence. Another problem in this movie is that it is supposed to be a ""Mutant"" based movie but there weren't really enough mutants, only Logan, Viper and Yukio. This fact also made the movie dull because it turned more into a ""One special person"" (Wolverine) against a lot of normal people who act more like ""Iron Man 2"" super villains than X-Men Villains.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there were a lot of action scenes that were very fun to watch and very well edited and the movie had a lot of funny ""Wolverine personality"" moments reminding me of his scene in ""X-Men: First Class"".<br/><br/>All in all, it was a fun to watch movie but not a lot more than that and one can only hope that another one will be made in the hopes of getting more out of the mutants and wolverine in particular."

","*6.5 / 10 Well, don't expect a parade of mutants in this movie because the amount of mutants appeared in this is really a few. Only 3, maybe? But it doesn't matter as Wolverine can take over the whole movie and no one will ever dare to interrupt him.<br/><br/>This ""The Wolverine"" movie is not just action like in the previous X-men movies featuring him. A bit of plot twist and drama is added to make this movie more interesting. Well, actually adding plot twist and drama spices to this movie is a good effort, but it doesn't feel right. Like turning into chick-flick.<br/><br/>Jean also appeared in this movie, only in Logan's dreams (and nightmares). I think, even if her scenes are removed, it won't change anything in this movie. A new character, also a mutant, Yukio, a seems-like Harajuku girl with red hair, is well-played. I love her chemistry with Logan as ""master and bodyguard"". And Mariko, she is just a sweetheart. Enough said.<br/><br/>And, the Wolverine himself. Hugh Jackman is still a badass. As the Wolverine character is just like Jackman's other personality. And well, I cannot comment much on Logan because he's fierce as usual.<br/><br/>The conclusion is, this movie is still worth watching, if you are a fan of Marvel or X-men movies. The action is just, yeah, action. No new action concept in this movie. Although fighting above shinkansen is a new idea. And the adamantium armor robot... This is not Real Steel, please. I know Hugh Jackman is in this movie but the armor robot is just so wrong.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't get up from your seat after the movie is finished. There is a post-credit scene.

"The_Dead_See","3","1","9","28 July 2013"," The dullest and sloppiest entry into the whole X Men canon.
","I'm gonna come straight out the gate and say The Wolverine was the dullest and most amateurishly wrought entry in the entire X Men canon. I didn't particularly like ""Origins"" but it had a whole lot more entertainment value to it than this lackluster attempt, so that's saying something. <br/><br/>Jackman is fine as usual, which is pretty impressive given the material he got to work with here. Unfortunately he gets to spend most of the movie getting wounded and then waking up on various beds and makeshift operating tables and that's about it. <br/><br/>It seems like a huge attempt was made to make the movie grittier and more complex than the simple soap opera that was Origins, but in doing so director James Mangold completely overshoots the mark and throws the baby out with the bathwater. What's left is an extraordinarily dull work that had me looking at my watch and even considering leaving the theater. Considering this is a superhero movie, there's a surprising lack of superheroes. In fact, other than the rather lame villain - the viper - there are no mutants in the film other than Wolverine, and he spends 90% of the movie without his powers.<br/><br/>While there are a couple of action setpieces (a fight on top of a train that's a little too close to the first Mission Impossible climax for comfort, and a fight with a Samurai suit of armour that's a little too close to the Iron Man climax for comfort), The Wolverine never seems to build up enough steam to get really rolling. Just when it seems a high point might be in view, Mangold throws in another half hour of fairly forgettable drama.<br/><br/>To cap it all off, there's an after credits scene that actually has the opposite affect as intended. It's a good after credits scene, and yes it tickles the fancy for the next installment, but what it also does is remind you how lacking the film you just saw was in just about every department. If James Mangold is let anywhere near the next entry, I'll be waiting for it to hit cable before bothering."

I thought the first half moved too slowly, and the second half was over too quickly.
There's one action scene in the first half. One! And it's incredibly fast, and hard to see.

","After the delightful X-Men: First Class, a Wolverine spin-off movie, set in Japan was quite unexpected, bearing in mind the regrettable X-Men: Origins - Wolverine.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the plot takes place (mostly) in Japan, keeping the prominence of the Japanese culture constantly emphasized. All well-known cliches appear, from the typical cherry blossom trees, to the remarkable katanas, and the famous doctrine of the samurai. Although the tradition of Japan is perfectly displayed, the notorious identity of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seems to have lost on the way.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, Wolverine encounters many unknown people, and acts unusually friendly with them. It's really surprising (and sometimes unconvincing) to see the submissive, and accepting side of the character, especially if we remember his furious temper when he first met the X-Men.<br/><br/>The other main characters are fairly solid, though not always comprehensible. The likable character of the princess, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), accompanied by the agreeable Yukio (Rila Fukushima) were grateful roles, nonetheless the actual treasure was the character of Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi/Ken Yamamura), who shakes up the otherwise tepid tale.<br/><br/>The glamorous environment of Japan makes the moderately dull story acceptable, even so it can't help the film of being a non mandatory piece of the franchise."

","At the beginning of the film we see how Wolverine processes the events from the last X-men film. Then he is asked to travel to Japan. An old rich businessman who saved Wolverine in the war, offers Wolverine to end his immortality so that he can just grow old and eventually die. Wolverine rejects the offer, but in one way or another he has lost his powerful powers.
Wolverine now has to save the granddaughter of the now deceased businessman because she inherited his business. Wolverine must protect her against a Japanese gang that appears to be under the leadership of the mysterious Viper.
The film can sometimes be a bit slow, but there is enough action and humor to keep you in the story. The story itself is beautiful, only sometimes predictable.
I was especially happy to see that Wolverine's claws really looked real, compared to Wolverine Origins. The biggest minus point I found to see the bone claws again. They seem less real and I am not a fan of them.
In retrospect, I liked the movie better than expected. Because of the trailer I had my doubts about Viper because she is not officially mutant, but in the film her mutation appeared to fit well and I found it an improvement compared to the comics. Just a shame that she can not now appear in the films at HYDRA, because the rights belong to different studios. Svetlana Khodchenkova plays the role of Viper perfectly.
Furthermore, I think this was Hugh Jackman's best performance of Wolverine of all X-men films. He has always been a fan of the Japanese story of Wolverine, which can be seen in the film about his acting work. The other actors also do well, but do not shine like Hugh Jackman and Svetlana Khodchenkova.
I do not understand that the film is 16+. There is only some violence in it, but nothing special. You also do not have to see the film in 3D. I only thought that the scene on the train was 3D worthy.
If you like superhero movies and especially an X-men fan, you should definitely see The Wolverine. He is much better than X-men Origins: Wolverine. Stay in front of the secret scene in the end."

","30 July 2013. It's hard not to like the substance and stylish action in this action-thriller movie set primarily in Japan. There is plenty of emotive connections, even with the beginning scene which in itself has potent appeal even though the plot seems a bit manipulative as well as the climatic ending which in some ways in a humanitarian letdown for the sake of a clever ending twist. Nevertheless, the periodical surreal dream scenes add much to Wolverine's psychological character and the other male-female relational developments are well done. Some of the motivations of the characters are undeveloped, especially the double-cross and this character's demise seemed overly too simple. The action scenes for the most part are decent, though there's one which seems almost overly Japanese suffering dramatized with Wolverine slogging away down a street under fire. The Japanese layered cultural backdrop was well done on par with Lost in Translation (2003).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this movie unlike Elecktra (2005) with Jennifer Garner attached much more burn and flash action focus for its sizzle whereas Jennifer Garner had a script that was nicely balanced in the Asian ways of fighting and mental discipline as well as incorporating an even more empathic and emotive underpinnings for its storyline. Even The Green Lantern (2011) offered Ryan Reynolds a consistently more solid humanistic focus with its solid storyline or Spiderman 2 (2004) and Spiderman 3 (2007) that offered even stronger superhero relational and ethical dilemmas."

James Mangold had a really easy job, just make it better than the abysmal X-Men Origins: Wolverine. He did that and then some. The balance between Logan's haunted past and the Yashida family affairs was perfect. The dream scenes with Jean Grey highlight how tainted Logan really is, how he struggles to let go of his past. It's a story about love, forgiveness...and badass swordplay sequences. Those of you who know me, know that my weakness in films are those that are set in Japan. I don't know why, it just is. James Mangold made Japan look beautiful, it was colourful and modern. Hugh Jackman, once again, is Wolverine. His physical prowess is ridiculous, clearly you don't want to have an arm wrestle with him...his veiny veins of vein-ness might just pop (seriously though have you seen them!?). Hiroyuki Sanada gets to wave a sword around, that's bonus points right there. The action sequences were thrilling and well filmed, I'm thankful that we as an audience are able to see everything and not be plagued with shaky cam or frequent jump cuts. The bullet train scene was damn fun to watch. The combination of modern and traditional Japan was well balanced and did not feel forced. The Viper was memorable enough to be classed as a good villain, maybe not the best choice of actress but it certainly wasn't a bad performance. Everything just felt fresh, it's what the franchise really needed. The third act does stumble into typical superhero blockbuster territory but that is to be expected, it couldn't stay mature forever I guess. Some of the slower scenes did drag slightly as well, but if anything it adds to Logan's character development. The Wolverine was fresh, bold and exciting to watch.

In conclusion, the movie has a great performance from Jackman, some good fun, entertaining action and a fresh setting for the superhero genre.<br/><br/>The types of people who will like this movie will be fans of Wolverine, people who were disappointed by Origins and probably just comic book/action fans in general.<br/><br/>Would Recommend.<br/><br/># POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine and you can tell he actually cared about this movie unlike in Origins. Tao Okomato was good as Mariko Yashida as was Rila Fukushima as as Yukio. The romance between Mariko and Logan felt so forced and unnecessary. Svetlana Khodchenkova was the modern day equivalent of Uma Thurman's 'Poison Ivy': that's not a compliment. Both Hal Yamanouchi and Lex Lang were both pretty weak as The Silver Samurai. Both Viper and The Silver Samurai were pretty weak villains and didn't stand out or were even that memorable. <br/><br/>The setting for this movie was so fresh and interesting and was a brilliant idea to set a Superhero movie somewhere other than America. Both the overall story and the ending were pretty weak.<br/><br/>I really liked the cinematography in this movie.<br/><br/>The effects were decent.<br/><br/>The first 1hr and 30min of this movie were awesome and was just hugely enjoyable. The last 10-20 minutes, not so much. Most of the action was excellent and was just fun to watch. It's also the same old Logan we came to know and love in the Bryan Singer X-Men.<br/><br/>The final confrontation were it turned into TRANSFORMERS was absolutely awful and took away from the film. The music was very weak.<br/><br/>Personally, I loved the first 1hr 40mins in this movie and hated the rest of it.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Unlike X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Wolverine: Immortal climate is much more grim. All thanks to the time of life of the hero himself. Depressive for killing Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), the great love of his life, he decides to live isolated from all. This new feature film invests in a side hitherto unheard of for the character, the work the tragic side of the hero. The script option acclimate history in Japan brings a freshness, a first welcome to the previous films, and put in question the existential questions that had already been addressed with less intensity Origins: Wolverine. Here one of the main hooks is the issue of Wolverine immortality, which begins isolated in the forest, depressed and unwilling to take his side warrior, still shaken by the X-Men events: The Last Stand and the tragic end that involved Jean Grey, the woman he loved. <br/><br/>James Mangold is another who knows how to highlight the positive points of this script. Mangold builds along with the photographer Ross Emery a darker atmosphere that reflects this existential dilemma of the protagonist and this climate is able to create exciting scenes and that somehow differ from common action movies. Lots of action was taken outdoors, also serving to enhance the beauty of Japan and the lifestyle of its inhabitants. Taking advantage also of the vast repertoire of martial arts of Asia, we see a huge amount of very good choreographers fights with impressive handling swords, knives, bows. All in perfect harmony and strategically inserted spaced manner along the production, never leaving the level of danger and threatens to dilute, always in a growing intelligent. Every new twist in the script, appeared new bold and creative scenes. Especially the opening scene in Nagasaki during the Second World War in which Wolverine shows his power and impress the young soldier Yashida that would be obsessed with the mutant and its origins. One can not fail to mention the fight scenes in the bullet train that results in another fight in the locomotive roof; also to the scene where Wolverine is targeted at full snow by dozens of spears the way Yashida family factory with the right bikes on the roofs of houses, a lot of wrestling with mind-blowing stunts; or the final fights in the factory, in particular the struggles between Yukio and Viper and between Wolverine and the Silver Samurai.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has never been so comfortable in the mutant skin with claws. The actor manages to perfectly transmit all dramatic conflicts and bitterness you live in Logan / Wolverine and was greatly benefited by having two very competent partner on the scene. Forming an excellent pair with Wolverine, the Wolverine ""bodyguard"", Yukio (Rila Fukushima) paraded her beauty, confidence and fighting skills at various times, always creating interesting sequences (the original on the scene in the bar where it prevents Logan finalize their revenge on the bear hunter in the forest, the scene where she faces Shingen, or in the final scenes in his confrontation with the Viper). On the other hand, the love interest of Wolverine is Mariko (Tao Okamoto), the most durable and known relationship Wolverine in the comics. successful model, the Japanese debut in theaters just in a successful blockbuster and does not disappoint. Okamoto, besides being beautiful, it is involved with Wolverine gradually. Initially when you see him, she rejects him, but will fall in love and feeling attracted to him during the coexistence between the couple. <br/><br/>The film is still exposed to a risk because as the story takes place in Japan, most of the cast is the country and the only big star to call the box office for the film was Hugh Jackman. But the little known cast, was very talented and do not Commit at any time. Hiroyuki Sanada as Shingen, Will Yun Lee as Harada, Ken Yamamura as young Yashida round out the supporting cast with great competence. Unfortunately, Harada was not much space in the plot, the original Silver Samurai comics in the film is just a bodyguard ninja, even a mutant, antagonist he went unnoticed as a mere assistant. We still have the special participation of Famke Janssen reprising again Jean Grey, which serves to inquire about the next paths that Wolverine can follow.<br/><br/>In addition to the appropriate picture already mentioned above, we should highlight the visual effects clean. Since the scenes of World War II to the scenes of the final climax are carried out with extreme competence. Even transpiring one unreality implementation in some scenes (fight scene on the bullet train ceiling), the realism of the effect reaches a fully satisfactory level. The soundtrack for Marco Beltrami - the same ""World War Z (2013)"" - also not exaggerate and remains a threat to theme all the time. The designer of the production François Audouy is a spectacle. Using many scenarios and typically Japanese elements, it led to the creation of new scenes in environments fleeing rather common.<br/><br/>Wolverine: Immortal is much higher than the previous film that explored the origins of the most famous mutant Marvel and satisfies the fans of the character to insert it in an unfamiliar environment and having to deal with many questions. Technically, Wolverine: Immortal does not clash at any time and is guaranteed fun. The film has a well- developed romantic side, a lot of creative action but fundamentally sin in its very fast and fanciful ending, with distortions of the Viper and Silver Samurai characters. Still, there is no longer an adventure capable of revitalizing Wolverine and regain the image of the hero for future productions."
"cherold","7","0","1","3 August 2016"," Decent, unexceptional, kind of falls apart at the end
","The Wolverine is a generally competent comic book movie. In the comic-book movie landscape overall, that's not a bad thing, but as an offshoot of the X-Men series, which is arguably the best of the comic-book movie series, it's rather disappointing.<br/><br/>The movie begins pretty well, with Logan, traumatized by the events of The Last Stand, hiding out in the forest having dreams about Jean and his time at Nagasaki, he gets into a fight, meets a young, hot woman with a way with a sword, and winds up in Japan fighting the Yakuza and meeting more young hot women.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are fairly entertaining, overall (there's a pretty good one on top of a bullet train), and Logan is given a handicap that makes things tougher for him, which is a nice touch.<br/><br/>The writing tends to laziness, particularly at the end, which includes non-sequiturs like one character changing her appearance for no apparent reason other than someone decided it would look cool (eh) and a twist that probably surprised no one.<br/><br/>The acting is mixed, although Jackman is good as always.<br/><br/>It's all perfectly watchable and completely forgettable. If you want mindless action and some sword play, it's a decent enough choice."
"filmfanperspective","6","0","1","5 May 2015"," Close, but not quite. Like most X-Men films.
","Sometimes, being the good guy isn't the best thing. Hugh Jackman has now played Marvel's Wolverine character five times in full, and briefly appeared in ""X-Men: First Class"". I like Hugh Jackman, and for all intents and purposes, the Aussie star seems to be a genuinely good, hard-working guy. However, not one moment has passed where I have considered his portrayal of the most popular Marvel mutant to be as defining as, say, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, or even Patrick Stewart as Professor X.<br/><br/>Could it be the character of Wolverine, and not the actor, that I find less interesting? It's entirely possible. Wolverine is virtually indestructible. His 'weapons' are attached to his skeleton in the form of adamantium claws. So, in essence, it requires very little skill for him to succeed at doing what he wants, because nothing stands in his way (other than an adamantium bullet, according to the last film). He's been alive for a few centuries, but what he's seen and done haven't driven him insane, or kept him from trying to function over and over again. I guess Wolverine might be the most boring 'immortal' ever. He never catches a break, but it never seems to completely drive his character over the edge.<br/><br/>This particular film incarnation of Wolverine isn't a 'bad' film, by any means. It's very nice to look at, and there is a smattering of memorable scenes, such as a flashback scene to World War II-era Nagasaki, with Logan as a P.O.W., an evenly matched battle between Logan and the adamantium-armored 'Silver Samurai', and a fun, if unbelievable, fight sequence on top of a bullet train.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, like most other X-Men entries, this is an incomplete film. It's not ""the Wolverine film we've been waiting for"", as some critics have opined (were we waiting for one?). For all the extravagance of the aforementioned scenes, it's the other pivotal scenes that don't work as well. For example, an old friend offers Logan the chance to join us mortals, an opportunity you'd think he'd relish no matter the cost, but he passes. A new lady friend gets close to Logan, and they end up being intimate (how old IS she?) despite her engagement to a politician, and despite his apparent loyalty to Jean Grey, but later he violently chides the politician fiancé for doing the same thing he did earlier- violate the commitment of that relationship, even if it was set up. Hypocrisy with Wolverine doesn't sit well with me, especially since the filmmakers have always asked us to give this violent, moody character the benefit of the doubt- this time it's inexcusable. On top of that, Jean Grey (or Phoenix, depending on your level of anal retentive-ness) appears throughout the film, but do we ever get a solid reason for why she's around, other than Logan dreaming about her? Does she exist on some spectral plane, or just as a figment of his imagination? I didn't notice an explanation either way.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, X-Men films are generally incomplete. Even the best of the series, ""First Class"", occasionally rides on too much style and not enough substance. I'm convinced that the series needs fresh faces in charge, and someone to ground the fantastical abilities of the characters in a more believable reality. We've been shown many scenarios throughout the six films which pit the mutants against the homo sapiens, but never on a level that I can imagine would be appropriate in real life. That's the big failure of the series, in my opinion. There is significant conjecture about the 'outcasting 'of mutants, and the 'brewing war' between humans and mutants, but aside from a couple random scenes, when do humans and mutants actually square off? Here's hoping that Bryan Singer finally graduates from director of pretty decent films to elite director with next years ""Days of Future Past"", and with the mutant hunting Sentinels, we actually HAVE the 'brewing war' alluded to in previous films. I'm not holding my breath that it will actually happen, though.<br/><br/>I think we desperately need a new style of film for the X-Men. Gritty, dark, and grounded would be a perfect approach for me. That's what we were promised with ""The Wolverine"", but I only see dark, with the imitation of gritty and grounded, much like the other films in the saga. My suggestion? Why not hire Darren Aronofsky again, and see what he comes up with? He was the original director on ""The Wolverine"", then bolted. The same thing happened before with ""First Class"" helmer Matthew Vaughn, who worked on ""The Last Stand"", and left. Aronofsky is an elite filmmaker. James Mangold is not. He's Bryan Singer, Brett Ratner, Gavin Hood, and Matthew Vaughn. He's good but not great. He's a fine filmmaker that hit on the brilliant ""3:10 To Yuma"", but had two super heavyweights heading the cast. Hugh Jackman is not a heavyweight. This movie isn't a heavyweight. After six entries, shouldn't we get something more exciting? Is it possible that the X-Men, simply, aren't that interesting to begin with? The best conclusion I can come up with is that the X-Men are just as interesting as most comic characters, but to this point, no filmmaker has taken the cinematic version of these characters to the next level. I say it's high time someone did."

","*****Contains spoilers******* I was really enjoying this film (well quite enjoying it) until about the time Logan pulled the spidery thingy out of his chest. The plot with the estranged boyfriend was fine, and it looked like the yakuza/father/green woman (what the heck ARE her powers??) villain plot was going to work out perfectly OK. Then it seems to me that there was a collective Hollywood-style ambush with some exec deciding that Wolverine MUST get the girl, there must be a criminal lair and the old guy who was the pull to get Logan to Japan must in fact go against his previous nobility and be a 'supervillain'. In fact they just decided 'we liked the ending of Iron Man 1 - let's just do that'. The last scene was utterly anti-climatic for me, and after the spider scene and as Logan got to the town next to the lair, I turned to my wife and said: ""I've quite enjoyed it but we appear to be heading for a b*****ks ending"". And we did. I tend to agree with the plot-holers in the highly rated reviews, but all that could be overlooked without the story going somewhat off the rails. Ah well..."
"francescomartini22","6","0","2","13 February 2015"," Here's what went wrong.
","I've seen this movie because I love the cinematographic saga of X-Men, I've loved basically every chapter has ever been made. But this movie went against my usual taste for several reasons.<br/><br/>I won't focus on the plot holes that have been widely pointed out (in almost every bad review) but I'm afraid they all have a point. This part is with no doubt one of the responsible for the bad achievements of the movie. Moreover, I think that one of the most interesting aspects of the X-Men saga was the orchestra of characters, which was the perfect expedient for plot-developing, personality building and even for the comic line. With the lack of every known X-Men here except for the Wolverine, it seems to me that we have lost the occasion for an interesting plot, for any analysis of Logan's character and for any comic line which is not lame.<br/><br/>An error rather than a lost occasion."
"cat-cec-song","9","0","1","9 January 2015"," Robot samurai and swords are made of adamantium
","A lot of reviews on this site mention that they don't understand how the grandfather/robot samurai was able to cut Logan's adamantium claws . . . however, in the movie it is pretty clearly stated that the grandfather bankrupted his company stockpiling adamantium, which was later used to build the robot and its its weapons. While adamantium is strong, and supposedly cannot be broken, it is theoretically possible to damage it with something else made out of adamantium. It's been a long time since I've read the comics, but I think it's canon that weapons used to defend against the Wolverine had to be made out of adamantium (e.g., Gambit's bo staff, etc). <br/><br/>While I don't think that this particular point is a plot hole, I was really disturbed at his losing his metal claws. I'm considerably less excited about seeing any sequel where the Wolverine doesn't have them. <br/><br/>Also, while I can't attest to the accuracy of the bombing sequence at Nagasaki, it was (disturbingly) beautifully shot, adding to the collection of rich visuals found throughout the movie."

","Excellent movie with incredible scenery and spectacular actors. This movie gets my vote as the best X-Men movie of the franchise. It gets deep into the story of Wolverine and does a really good job at keeping the entertainment at an all time high.<br/><br/>Wolverine is trying to decide if his powers are a good thing or a bad thing. His powers can be very stressful as those around him are not able to keep up with him and be by his side as he wished. The problems with this film and why I did not give it a 10 is the Logan and Mariko's relationship. I was thinking Logan had more chemistry or it would make a better story if he hooked up with Yukio. I just think the chemistry was not there for Logan and Mariko.<br/><br/>The other problem with this movie is after watching it I cannot enjoy X-Men Days of Future Past.<br/><br/>The only thing needed after this movie is an Origins made about the Jean Grey character. I do believe she is the strongest character in the X-Men and she deserves her own standalone movie."

It was a bit too silly for me.<br/><br/>However, I did really like the fact that it was more about Wolverine the character as opposed to Wolverine the plot device, as was the case in the aforementioned film.

","The Wolverine had the task of rejuvenating the Wolverine franchise after the failed attempt of X- Men Origins. Did it succeed? Did it fail? I think it did pretty alright. This was mostly a character driven film with very little plot. It starts off strong with a very emotional and intense scene, but from there the film starts to lose path. The viper chick was a useless character that felt forced into the script in order to have more than two mutants. The Wolverine lacked a villain with strong presence, a plot, and an impactful score especially for a superhero movie. Hugh Jackman is at his best, and at this point it feels as if nobody else can play the legendary comic book character but him. The fight scenes had very good choreography, but the shaky camera made it hard to focus in what was going on. I especially like the train fight scene, even if it did make the eyebrows of every physicist rise. I appreciate this movie because they are at least on the right path to making wolverine movies, which origins failed to accomplish, but I cannot excuse The Wolverine of its empty plot driven solely on the development of one character surrounded by many seemingly empty characters."

","""The Wolverine"" is the first time we get to see Wolverine in action, with plenty of blood, killing, swearing (well, the ""F bomb"" was dropped 3 times, not that often) and all that other good stuff. As always, Hugh Jackman is superb in the role but there are a few aspects of the film that bring the whole experience down.<br/><br/>Performances by the rest of the cast can be notably bad and lifeless at times and it doesn't help that characters are written to be quite stupid and one-dimensional. I have a feeling that some actors were only cast because they were experienced in fighting and choreography for the plentiful action scenes scattered in the film. The romance between Logan and Mariko was unnecessary and felt too forced. The plot becomes a little difficult to follow as we get further into the film and is illogically explained towards the end.<br/><br/>There are plenty of moments that make you scratch your head and make you question what the filmmakers were actually thinking; Wolverine disobeying the laws of physics (on the train), successfully striking the adamantium robot with one clean sweep and then deciding to make it fall over instead of finishing it off, Wolverine not doing anything at all about the multiple arrows being shot into his back and not even looking as if he's running fast enough to escape them and to get to Mariko, the Viper not using her powers immediately when confronted by Yukio, the list goes on.<br/><br/>""The Wolverine"" opened with a very good 45 minutes but the remainder of the film gets silly along with both the plot and the characters. Hugh Jackman and his badass Wolverine moments may make this worth the watch but pretty much everything else doesn't."

","Okay, so everyone likes Wolverine best out of the X-men, so it was no surprise that he got his own movie out of it. However, 'Origins' (as it was titled) wasn't as popular at the box office as the studio would have liked. Yet, due to the fact that it's Wolverine, who cares? So... let's give him another movie anyway.<br/><br/>This time out steel-boned (or Adamantium, or whatever it's called) is in Japan, so expect plenty of fights with samurai. Next adventure he'll probably be in Norway, followed by a film set in Brazil, before finally ending up in Wales. Anyway, it doesn't really matter where he is... Hugh Jackman continues to do a decent enough portrayal as the titular character to make the movie worth sitting through. He fights, he growls, he fights a bit more. It's all good. However, this time the whole 'mutant aspect' which was so familiar in the X-men and Origins has been toned down a bit more.<br/><br/>In this story (and I'm not 'spoiling' it for you as it's in the trailer) Wolverine loses his powers of rejuvenation and so needs to be a little more careful when taking on his enemies. Therefore you don't need to be a mutant (or have their 'mutant powers') to defeat him).<br/><br/>So, if you like the X-Men, or just gritty action, you'll probably like this one.

Well, The Wolverine is better obviously but it is still not enough for such character.<br/><br/>In this movie, we see Logan form a friendship with a Japanese soldier in a hole during the bombing of Nagasaki. That is really a great base to write a good plot. But in the end, we see that Japanese soldier, Yashida got obsessed with immortality and attempting to take Logan's healing abilities by fighting him in a gigantic armor/robot. Really?? Is that the best you can do? There are other minor inconsistencies in the movie. But that one I mentioned completely ruined it.<br/><br/>If you cannot write a good plot, then make it more simple. If you cannot make it more emotional and personal as it started, then create a more traditional nemesis which MAKES SENSE. Yakuza could have been used in a more proper way. I'd definitely prefer a simple mob boss who uses some mutants (like Viper) to defend himself rather than a gigantic adamantium Samurai-like weird looking robot.<br/><br/>My expectations were not sky high obviously and I enjoyed it more than Origins.

","Wolverine is the fulcrum of the X-Men franchise, appearing in every one and clocking up far more screen time than any other character. He had his own movie with ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" and he does so again here but, whereas the 2009 film was a look back at his life of centuries, this one - after a scene set in 1945 Nagasaki - looks forward a little to a time after ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" when he is still mourning the death of Jean Gray and has attempted to withdraw from society. It is a darker work than other ""X-Men"" forays, being a tale of existential angst as Logan struggles with the curse of immortality and the loss of so many friends.<br/><br/>After Dougray Scott had to pull out of the role in the first ""X-Men"" Australian Hugh Jackson has made the role totally his own. The hair, the beard, the T-shirt, and of course those adamantium claws are all his. What makes this sixth ""X-Men"" adventure particularly different and entertaining is that it is largely set in Japan (although it was mainly shot in Jackman's home country Australia). <br/><br/>So Wolverine is presented as a ronin - a samurai with no master - and meets a collection of exotic players, some of whom are allies - beautiful Mariko (former model Tao Okamoto) and playful but accomplished Yukio (Rila Fukushima) - and some of whom - Mariko's husband Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada) and her former lover Harada (Will Yun Lee) - who may or not be on his side. We see a more vulnerable version of Wolverine as his powers of healing start to diminish and there is a moving scene as he is brought to a halt by a succession of arrows in the back.<br/><br/>Will he survive?

It's naturally all about the Wolverine Logan but we do have other characters from X-men in it so you have to know a bit of the story and The Wolverine is no exception. It doesn't stand on it's own. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) do plays an important role even as she's in it for a few minutes. Nevertheless, if you don't know any of the history you can watch it but you will be left with some questions.

I had two problems with this flick, but one I could get over, it doesn't has any blood or cruelty all over the flick, sure, The Wolverine gets hurt but heals himself but I mean, when swords are battling with Logan, we never see swords going into the flesh, or when the wolverine gets mad and smashes his claws into the flesh it's all done off-camera. But I knew that before, it was rated 12 years. But I did had a problem with the 3D. It just never worked out. here and there but I never had the 3D experience I had with other blockbusters. The effects on the other hand are good but not sublime. The train scene is excellent but their were other effects like the healing that I didn't like at all.<br/><br/>Mixed emotions again with the X-men..., simple story line and of course an open ending..For many the best so far in the X-men franchise. It wasn't bad I admit but not a wowser. <br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5"
"tgrock","8","0","3","12 March 2014"," Second Best Superhero Movie Ever Made!
","This is by far the best X-Men movie ever made. And it's better than any of the Marvel-verse movies (let's be honest: the only good ones were Iron Man 1 and The Incredible Hulk) and all of the Spider-Man movies. I was let down by The Dark Knight Rises (mainly its inexcusable unrealistic second half).<br/><br/>So, let me tell you why it's the second best X-Men movie ever made.<br/><br/>1. First Class and The Last Stand suffered from too many mutants. Here we only have 3 mutants in the whole movie. Because of this, I don't have to suffer through cheesy scenes where mutants show off their powers to each other or see B-mutants that I don't care about develop their powers.<br/><br/>2. Seeing Wolverine emotionally and physically vulnerable. He gets dreams of Jean Grey constantly, whom he killed in The Last Stand. He does not want to live because he killed her. He secretly loved her, and never wanted to kill again. This last mission gives him purpose. The last battle scene seems to be getting a lot of flack for being your typical comic book last battle scene. I don't see that at all as Wolverine is clearly outmatched by The Silver Samurai.<br/><br/>3. There are only a few action scenes. But they are brutal. Wolverine is interesting because he cares so little for the life of bad guys. And he has never been more reckless here in killing them. Having a few action scenes is better. The movie can focus more on his character this way.<br/><br/>4. X-Men 2: X-Men United was a great comic book movie. But having a superhero more grounded in reality makes for a much more interesting film always. This is way Iron Man 1 was good and why The Dark Knight trilogy was mostly great. By not showing other mutants and by not having a mutant-related conflict, The Wolverine is more grounded in reality. Instead, you have just a mutant involved in a human conflict.<br/><br/>(Spoiler) I saw a reviewer criticize that the female character and Wolverine had no chemistry. They didn't need chemistry to be physically attracted to each other and have sex. It makes sense for the female character to want to have sex with Wolverine (way more than Talia Al Ghul and Bruce Wayne in The Dark Knight Rises). They are not in it for a relationship. They just had sex.<br/><br/>Now why is it the second best superhero movie ever?<br/><br/>1. Spider-Man 2 has unbearable scenes between Aunt May and Peter. 2. Iron Man has a lame last battle scene. 3. Batman Begins has some cheesy dialogue and moments. Plus, it has Katie Holmes. 4. The Avengers is nothing more than popcorn entertainment with no thought at all. Plus, it has some horrible acting and dialogue in it by Colbie Smoulders. 5. Man of Steel is great, but they got the whole fighting concept all wrong. Superman or Zod never seems to get hurt or knocked out in their fight with one another. They don't bleed or get bruises. 6. Superman: The Movie and Superman 2 both have the horrible, 'let's undo everything' ending.<br/><br/>The Wolverine doesn't have any of these cringe-worthy moments."

","Marvel has got a lot of heroes but most popular and maybe most liked is Wolverine.I like wolverine too but not much as Professor X.If we touch on movie,not brilliant story and only good acting coming from Hugh Jackman,boring and similar action scenes.First hour of movie is boring and ordinary.Everybody can understand Haruhiko's last wish not to say goodbye to wolverine.And the end of the story was terrible and viper wasn't enough to be archenemy and silver suit was very familiar.Logan always see jean at his dreams and that was very upset to me but in this movie this feeling of compassion used too much and I was bored about that.To sum up movie was boring and full of ordinary action scenes but If you liked wolverine like me you can easily finish the movie.It deserve five points from me because It came to me very ordinary and boring just scenes with Yukio was good and new or fresh.At least we have seen wolverine in the Japan.I congratulate Hugh Jackman and Rila Fukushima.I really want to see a new Wolverine movie without an ordinary story."

","""The Wolverine"" is the new story of Wolverine and how he is today. He lives a nomad life but when he summoned to Japan by an old acquaintance, he is embroiled in a conflict that forces him to confront his own demons. In this movie we watch a little bit from the history of Wolverine but with some differences and some new information come out.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie but not as much as I liked the ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" which also had to do with Wolverine's history and past. I also liked this movie because of the interpretations of Hugh Jackman, Tao Okamoto who plays as Mariko and Svetlana Khodchenkova who plays as Viper and we watch this character of Marvel for first time.<br/><br/>Finally I believe that everyone have to watch this movie because it shows us the after X-Men story and life of Wolverine and how the story continues."
"leonblackwood","7","0","1","19 January 2014"," Great comic book adaptation! 7/10
","Review: I quite enjoyed this epic movie which had a great storyline and some brilliant action. It was good to see that they done something great with the Wolverine character and that Hugh Jackman done a great job portraying the comic book hero. I don't really have that much bad to say about the movie, but it was a bit long and, for some unknown reason, not very remember-able. When you see the movie for the first time, you will be impressed, but it's not the type of movie that you can see time and time again like Star Wars or some of the Batman's. I'm still yet to see the really moody side to Wolverine, which I have heard about in the comics, and the character does lack some wit and cockiness, but he does kick butt well. In all, a very watchable movie which I found quite entertaining. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I wasn't that impressed with the first Wolverine movie, because it didn't really live up to the hype, but I did find this one much better. The ending does make me want to see what they are going to do with the next X-Men movie, if they actually introduce Wolverine into the franchise properly, and I hope that the next Wolverine brings in some other superheroes. As for Hugh Jackman, it's a bit hard watching some who sang and danced at the Oscars and sang his way through Les Miserables, play such a deep character such as Wolverine, but he does play the part well. With the amount of money that it made, the audiences must have been happy with this adaptation so I'm sure that were going to see Hugh Jackman playing this role again.<br/><br/>Budget: $120million Worldwide Gross: $415million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into the Wolverine and X-Men franchise and who like there action comic book hero movies. 7/10"

","I had to take some No Dose to wake up to put in this review. This has to be the most BORING movie in the Xmen franchise. I was excited to rent the movie from red box, I should have saved my $1.50 or rented the something else instead. Who ever gave this drivel over 5 star had to be paid sponsors or smoking something funny. I fast forwarded thru much of the movie...I would have been upset if I had went to the movies..I just can't get over how utterly boring this movie is. The only good thing in this movie are a few, and I mean few fight scenes. Like other reviewers have pointed out, there are so many plot holes, there were no surprises, you knew that Logan was going to sleep with Miriko, you knew her fiancé was on the take, you knew the white lady was an evil mutant, I didn't care who lived or died...they just completely changed the makeup of the Wolverine, so what he is supposed to be indestructible, screw a plot that makes any sense..by the time it got to 'BIG' fight scene, my annoyed/suspend common sense quota had been Maxed out and I spent the rest of the movie writing this review. Save your money, and time..or better yet, if you have insomnia, play this movie, it will put you right to sleep."
"Mr-Fusion","7","0","1","15 January 2014"," Finally, a decent Wolverine flick!
","One of the opening scenes in THE WOLVERINE probably does the best job of showcasing the title character that we've seen thus far on-screen. He stumbles upon a dying bear, tracks the killers to a nearby dive bar, and strolls in with malicious intent. Even though he doesn't end up killing anyone, it's a fist-pump of a scene to see the man in his element, doing what he does best.<br/><br/>As superhero movies go, this one feels like a breath of fresh air; a personal story that brings Logan face-to-face in Japan with his past and getting mixed up with the yakuza. It's a slow burn but certainly not boring. Hugh Jackman slips back into the role with ease, carrying the character's baggage with sardonic wit. The fight scenes are lightning fast and hit hard, especially the zonked-out boss battle. And the story leaves Logan in an interesting place, character-wise. <br/><br/>This totally makes up for X-MEN ORIGINS.<br/><br/>7/10"
"nickel_for_your_thoughts","6","0","1","15 January 2014"," Entertaining, but...
","Let me begin by saying I did not dislike this film, however there were some things about it I found irksome.<br/><br/>The first one, and the most glaringly irksome for me was the fact that Viper's (Svetlana Khodchenkova's) lines were dubbed, and they were not dubbed well. It is extremely noticeable in her scenes and is very distracting. The actress herself does a great job, but it makes me wonder why they did not cast someone whose voice they would not have to replace. In my opinion this choice compromises the quality of the film.<br/><br/>The second thing that I disliked is the contradictory nature of Wolverine. I'm not that familiar with the comics, so pardon my ignorance and lack of in depth knowledge into ""who"" Wolverine is. I'm not sure if it's my ignorance or just the character in the film, but there were things that he did that didn't really jive with what they were trying to portray. For example, if he is so devastated over Jean to the point where he sees her constantly why was it so easy for him or even possible for him to be intimate with Mariko? Also, if he is so just why is it that he can and Mariko can have a relationship, but it's so incredibly wrong to him to discover her fiancé is cheating (before he found out he put a hit on her)? Is Wolverine just like this by nature and design, or was this a bit of an oversight? I've seen all of the other films with Jackman as Wolverine, and it did not seem this way in them.<br/><br/>Those things I mentioned are the reason why I gave it 6 out of 10 stars. They made me question what I was watching, and I didn't completely ""buy what they were selling"" which in my opinion with films is the ultimate goal. The questions they raised for me broke the illusion.<br/><br/>Jackman does a great job as the title character, to the point where I cannot imagine anyone else in the role, and Yukio (Rila Fukushima) outshines her ""sister"" Mariko (Tao Okamoto) in the like-ability department.<br/><br/>That all being said, it's worth watching, and it gives more insight to Wolverine, and ties in an interesting story from his past that holds your attention even though it's not a ""save the world from disaster"" type of film. It lives up to its name, and unlike Thor and the like it focuses solely on Wolverine and his own struggle for his life and identity without a large external threat that could destroy everyone."
"alindsay-al","8","0","1","14 January 2014"," A new fresh take on The Wolverine
","Unlike most people I actually enjoyed the previous X men Origins Wolverine film for what it was, a good prequel to a character that everybody knows and loves. However, there were certain problems with that film and I feel almost the exact same way about this film as I did its predecessor. This Wolverine film, obviously has the return of the fantastic Hugh Jackman in his most iconic role to date and the role he will probably be remembered for his longevity to the character. This Wolverine is set after the events of X men 3 The last stand with Logan leaving the X men and setting out on his own, mainly because of his hallucinations of his ex lover Jean Grey. This film though tries to stay away from the other X men films and focus on Logan with this story being all about The Wolverine. This films setting in Japan is a nice change from the common use of New York in these Comic book films and allows this film to feel unique. This films greatest positives are the scenery, the awesome action sequences and just the fact of once again another fantastic performance from Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The main weaknesses are the real forced romance in this film which just feels awkward and unnecessary between Jackman and his Japanese lover. But the main weakness is the antagonists are poor compared to previous villains such as Magneto, Sabertooth and William Stryker. The Villains in this film are not as compelling and are not in my opinion a worthy enemy for Wolverine. But overall this is an exciting new take on the Wolverine character that should be experienced by all x-men fans and Wolverine fans because of it's different take on the lore. (By the way stay after the credits to see a special appearance by some old friends)."
"leather-turtle","7","0","1","12 January 2014"," Probably the worst of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine movies.... but still okay
","My giving this a 7 instead of a 6 or lower is out of a combination of sentiment for Wolverine and genuine appreciation for Hugh Jackman's quality, which he brings to the Wolverine character.<br/><br/>Every other Wolverine movie (including the X-Men movies) was better than this one, even the ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" which I've heard complaints about.<br/><br/>The action sequences, characters, plot, and general meaning of the movie always seemed a bit lacking or noticeably put on.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie *******SPOILER ALERT******* when the bad guy tries to suck Wolverine's life-healing power through his claws, it seemed tremendously fake.<br/><br/>The idea of Jean coming to Logan in a dream could have been executed better if they didn't make her character seem so 2-dimensional. She was more than Phoenix or a victim of Wolverine's claws when he had to kill him. She was a human being that actually cared. Giving her that humanity in the dreams would have allowed some depth from Hugh Jackman's character instead of him just being angry or haunted or just constipated with irrational guilt.<br/><br/>It was too easy to see through this movie. When Yukio says she didn't see Yashida's death, the logical conclusions can easily be drawn. There was nothing else shown in that moment. There was no greater acting but to sustain the moment with hollow sentiment.<br/><br/>If Marvel could just concentrate a little more on the quality and complexity of the writing, perhaps the $120 million it cost to make this movie would have paid off better. I think all the actors, at least, were capable of greater things. If only they could have written something deeper or more meaningful for them to work with, this wouldn't be a load of techno-dependent fluff.<br/><br/>But I maintain my 7 out of 10 rating. Despite the above complaints and more detailed complaints I could make about the fighting choreography or the stupidity of the Silver Samurai and the heated-adamantium swords, this was not a complete waste of time to watch. It was still full of action and it moved. Although I don't truly recommend this movie, you could easily do worse with so many other movies that fail to entertain.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is very talented and thank goodness it was him keeping up the character. I don't think anyone else could have made this movie the success it was. It simply would have fallen apart without such strong focus on Jackman, his acting, and the gritty sincerity he brought to the film, without which, this movie would just be junk.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie truly expecting something worthy of the franchise or you'll be disappointed. But if you want something action-packed and can ignore it's many noticeable lapses in quality and details, you may also overlook that the interesting Wolverine of the X-Men movies is lacking in wit and emotional sincerity.<br/><br/>Barely a 7 to me, but more of a 7 than a 6, certainly."
"darrenandgwen-661-168573","8","0","1","12 January 2014"," Finally.
","After X-Men 3 and Origins I really wasn't expecting much from The Wolverine, even the trailer seemed predictable.<br/><br/>What I watched was a fantastic, deep and moving action movie that made a seemingly immortal character vulnerable both physically and emotionally. The supporting cast were all excellent and the plot moved at a great speed through several twists and turns to an ultimately satisfying conclusion. The inclusion of Jean Grey was magnificent working to great effect and Hugh Jackman's performance was gripping in a role he is clearly not bored with yet. The Wolverine will get fans of the character and the X-Men who have been disappointed with Fox's treatment of the series back on board and chomping at the bit for Days of Future Past. Well worth the money."
"Dano-ho27","8","0","1","1 January 2014"," One of the best so far!
","I'm not going to say that ""The Wolverine"" was the best X-men movie ever, I probably X2 the best, but I do think that it the best in a long while. Fine writing, very little of the corny special effects we saw in the X-men movies and Origins, and an interesting idea to fight Wolverine. For all the people out there who say it makes no sense, especially on one review, saying that it's stupid that his claws can be cut, think before posting. If diamonds can cut diamond, iron can cut iron, then shouldn't it make sense that adamantium can cut adamantium? Sense nothing is stronger than this fictional metal, it makes sense that it can cut its self right? And then with the heart bug. All that bug was doing was suppressing Logan's powers not taking them away, so when he destroys the bug, his powers kick back in and that's how he heals. All in all, ""The Wolverine"" was a pretty good movie. Sure it could have been could, but look at the other X-men movies, it did pretty good compared to them."

","After I finished watching I was definitely appalled and I took time to think about whose fault was this... travesty. I don't know much about making a movie, so I can't point a finger but.. oh, wow. Has anyone read the plot before deciding it was a good idea to make this movie?<br/><br/>If it was not a movie so advertised and expected, and it wasn't an X-men movie, if Wolverine was a new character etc. I might have give 2 stars. I'll be honest about that. But the expectations were -and should be- high when you are working on Wolverine and the product has to live up to it. <br/><br/>Whole movie feels like it was rushed, you can feel the ropes pulling the actors, character's motives are unclear or -more precisely- nonexistent. The plot is a disaster, other reviewers made lists about them, I won't repeat. The whole production is just sloppy. As if they are testing the audience to see ""how much more can we go down and still have some viewers? what is the lower limit?"" like an experiment. And you can hear the murmur in the background throughout the movie: ""how can we milk this cow with the least of efforts?""<br/><br/>Shame on you. Really. I would be ashamed to have my name on the credits if I worked in any part of it. I just pity Hugh Jackman has been a part of it. And I am still puzzled the fact that he somehow accepted to be in it."
"ajping","7","0","1","28 December 2013"," Not a bad film but could have been a lot better
","This film works well on many levels. The action sequences are solid, especially the scene on the bullet train. The score is excellent and the sets, costumes, etc. are well done. Acting is also good with a solid cast including of course Hugh Jackman reprising a role he is very familiar with. Okamoto does reasonably well, but she is just a bit too weak and waifish - almost skeletal - it would have been better if she had put on a few pounds of muscle for the role.<br/><br/>There are several plot holes but these are also problems in the source material apparently. The most annoying one is the bombing of Nagasaki in the opening scene which shows Japanese soldiers performing seppuku as if they knew what the bomb would do. The reality is that the bombs were a surprise to everyone and the scene at Hiroshima after the first one was mass confusion - there is no way the soldiers could have known what was about to hit them. Also, it was a cloudy day, etc...<br/><br/>But finally, the entire movie is just a tad bit anti-climactic. It's hard to say why, but there is never really a sense that Wolverine or his friends are truly in mortal danger. The action sequences feel just a bit too staged.<br/><br/>This is still a decent movie but you will be left thinking it could have been so much more."

","In 1945, Logan (Hugh Jackman), the Wolverine, is held in a Japanese POW camp near Nagasaki. During the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Logan rescues a Japanese soldier named Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) and shields him from the blast. In the present day, Logan lives as a hermit in the Yukon, tormented by nightmares of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), whom he was forced to kill at the end of X-Men: The Last Stand. He is located by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a mutant with the precognitive ability to foresee people's deaths and is skilled with a samurai sword, on-behalf of Yashida, now the CEO of a technology corporation. Yashida, who is dying of cancer wants Logan to accompany Yukio to Japan so that he may repay his life debt. The moribund Yashida offers mortality to Logan, transferring his gift to him, but Logan does not accept the offer.<br/><br/>This movie is completely different from any Hollywood superhero movie. Its also a hardcore and character driven movie. It definitely stands out from the plethora of superhero movies. Halfway through the movie, I was thinking to myself about how surprisingly good of a character study this was even though I could predict most of the story and some of the action was over the top. Then it all went bonkers and the strong first half was ruined by a completely contrived romantic turn. Of course, the white guy has to sleep with the first beautiful girl that he sees in another country and she'd obviously be willing to jump him. I wouldn't really blame the girl though. Have you looked at Jackman! He could probably turn me gay. But, Logan moving on from Jean in such a short amount of time and loving the new girl didn't ring true on any level, especially when he dreamt of her every night and was highly emotional for her. A stupid typical final act destroyed any hopes of The Wolverine somehow veering on to the right path. The villains, Viper and the Samurai transformer, were ridiculously cartoonish and didn't have much purpose for the final fight to take place. The less we talk about them, the better.

Logan/Wolverine has been so established previously, and i understand that it need to establish other characters, but the first fight happen around 40 mins... and there ain't that much of them.

Setting this up post Xmen 3 was maybe somewhat of a risky decision and i think it didn't paid too much. Don't get me wrong, the fights that there is are cool, but there too few of them and there was something that felt like this was not the Wolverine i know.<br/><br/>Best scene to me was the Magneto/Xavier cameo at the end... which is supposed to set up the next Xmen movie...<br/><br/>In any case, not a bad movie at all, but one i felt was ... ordinary and i will really forget quick."

Like the classic movie, there are always the good, the bad, and the ugly.<br/><br/>THE GOOD Well, I guess this is the first (I don't really count but I guess this is the biggest yet) box office superhero movie with mostly main location outside US.

But, this Wolverine beautifully choose Japan and tradition attached as main location and character which is bring new window that superhero can have a great action outside America.<br/><br/>THE BAD I don't think that Logan sexual relationship with Mariko was important. Even feeling to her for me like forbidden fruit. He loved Jane and always will but she already gone, but it doesn't men that he must have to falling in love and made love with his former ""friend"" life-in-danger grand daughter. To keep her safe doesn't mean sex involved. That's a really lame connection. <br/><br/>THE UGLY Absolutely the script. I know the screen writer had already taken much effort to balance this superhero movie to Japan tradition, but the worst part actually on it. There are some character's motive didn't really run well. For example, ""Viper"", there is no truly motive for her to help old man getting immortal life. Even character ""Yukio"" was completely garbage, and also Minister of Justice was dead character.<br/><br/>The script also predictable.

OK, Logan is invincible and there are some other mutants involved, but most of all it is an action movie about a guy protecting a chick. I also understood where the character came from. What I would call reckless idiocy in any other movie is a typical Wolverine behavior. I also liked the Japanese angle, although too little of their culture was shown and it was too stereotyped.<br/><br/>What I noticed most in the film, however, is how old everybody is. Famke Janssen appears as a memory of Jean Grey, you know her - really beautiful - but she got old. Hugh Jackman is full of muscle and manly frowns, but when he needs to run he also needs camera tricks to hide the clumsiness of an old guy running around. And at the end (you have to wait until after the first credits) you get a little scene with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan hinting that the third Wolverine (or X-Men, or whatever) will be about Sentinels. Both those guys looked ancient. Of course, in order to compensate the oldies, sexy young women were used. And as usual, when in need of a stunningly beautiful female villain, always use a Russian girl. Svetlana Khodchenkova's Viper was a pretty nasty villain; I would have wanted to see more of her.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun film, without being overly sci-fi or X-Men related. It seemed a little bit low budget for a movie of this genre, though. Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece and you'll probably enjoy it."

","What makes the Mutants so cool that it has spread into a franchise of six movies with the seventh one in the making? Some of the fans would say ""multiple superheroes at the price of one ticket"". Many others would agree to a different answer: The Wolverine.<br/><br/>That perhaps is the only reason why Wolverine features in every X-men movie, an honor that no other mutant enjoys. Several reasons to this: retractable Adamantium claw, ripped off body & above all, Invincibility.<br/><br/>""The Wolverine"" is a bold attempt in many ways. Unlike other X men movies where you get to see various mutants alongside Logan, this one is pretty much a one man show. This movie also brings out the emotional coefficient of Logan in almost every scene, something which become irritating at one point.<br/><br/>Logan is almost convinced that ""Invincibility can indeed be a curse"". But if living across centuries, not aging one bit and getting the attention of every beauty on the planet can be a curse, then somebody please curse me.<br/><br/>The action sequences do not disappoint but one must have the patience to sit through the lecture class between the action scenes.On the whole the movie seemed a bit slow, mainly because of the one man show and it was hard to even imagine ""pain"" and ""Wolverine"" in the same sentence.<br/><br/>The only consolation in this movie was Hugh Jackman himself. Playing the same role in seven (including the one in making) different movies is not something that every actor can imagine of (Unless you are Harry potter & Co). However ironic it may sound, with that huge sideburns, we might as well start calling Jackman as ""Hairy Potter"".<br/><br/>I hope the Wolverine trilogy ends on a high note."

","""You are strong. You have courage, real courage but that won't help you much now."" Logan (Jackman) is called to Japan by an old friend. What he finds is something he never could have imagined. For the first time in his live Logan is vulnerable and is pushed to his limits to not only save himself but to save those around him and even The Wolverine is no match for what he has to face. First of all I will say that I liked the first X-men and loved First Class but wasn't a fan of the others so I wasn't really looking forward to this one all that much. I am also not a comic book fan. I say that for two reasons. First I know the movie is based off a comic story line so fans of that will love this movie. For the casual X-Men fan like me this is nothing like an X-Men movie at all. Again even though this is based off an actual comic plot the movie felt like; ""Let's make a samurai movie."" ""No one in America would watch one though"" ""Put Wolverine in it and they will."" Without trying to give anything away they could have done this movie with out the Wolverine character and it would have not changed anything. There is even a scene where he uses a Samauri sword to fight with instead of his claws...really. The best part of the movie is the little scene during the credits so be sure to watch that. Overall, this does not have the feel of an X-Men movie at all so if that's what you are looking for be warned. Comic book readers will love this though. I didn't. I give it a C."
"JPfanatic93","7","0","2","23 September 2013"," Still not the movie Wolverine deserves
","Hugh Jackman returns to the role of Logan, the X-Man with the healing factor and adamantium skeleton and claws, for the sixth time (after only a brief but hilarious cameo appearance in X-Men: First Class (2011)). Several years after the cataclysmic events of X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), that witnessed the death of his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) at his own hands for the greater good, Logan is still in agony, travelling through Canada aimlessly in search for something to believe in again. When young female ninja Yukio (Rila Fukushima) finds him at a bar picking a fight with irresponsible hunters, she offers him a chance for redemption, of sorts. Her employer, the powerful Japanese clan leader and major industrialist Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), is dying and wants to thank Logan for having saved his life back in 1945, when an atom bomb was dropped on both their heads at Nagasaki. Logan haphazardly accepts the invitation but is dismayed to learn the old man's offer of taking his ""curse"" of ""immortality"" – not wholly accurate, as Wolverine isn't truly immortal, he just ages much slower than everybody else – for himself so he won't have to die,and Logan can live a normal life if he so chooses. All too soon, Logan finds himself immersed in a complicated web of intrigue in the clan's affairs, revolving around Yashida's legacy and his decision to leave everything to his granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) upon his demise. Before long, the girl has to run for her life, dodging Yakuza bullets and ninja swords, but fortunately Logan has taken a liking to her and aims to protect her from harm. Matters turn worse when Yashida's shady physician, a sexy mutant poisoner named Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), manages to disable Logan's healing abilities, thus rendering him vulnerable.<br/><br/>Credit has to be given to Jackman for sticking to the Wolverine character for so long, which prohibits the use for a reboot at some point as most other superheroes with movie careers have already experienced. It also allows for Logan's emotional and sensual side to be explored, something director James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma) doesn't amply succeed in. It seems odd for this typically 'loner' character, who finally found a family with his fellow mutants, to just go and get himself caught up in what's basically a very private affair in a family he doesn't know, in a culture he hardly understands, even though he had nothing to lose. The various family ploys and their ramifications for Japanese and Yakuza politics hardly feel coherent, as everybody has his or her own motivations for gaining power, some of them underexposed, others needlessly complicated and layered so their bigger picture proves difficult to grasp. Logans romantic entanglement with Mariko is a typical Hollywood love plot, except for Logan being plagued by inexplicable, pointless visions of dear deceased Jean: of course her death still haunts her, but apparently her mental powers have left some sort of astral imprint upon Logan, or so I surmise since the writers never bother to fully explain this aspect of the plot. It just seems like an overly simple, lazy excuse to get Famke Janssen back for a few short sequences. Whatever the movie lacks in character logic it mostly makes up for in action, with a knife fight on the roof of a high speeds train as the most intense moment in that category. Otherwise however, the action scenes seem somewhat repetitive with their focus on samurai and ninja clichés, culminating in a big action piece between Logan and a mecha-warrior with a burning sword, which is this movie's take on Marvel's original Silver Samurai character. The make-up of some featured characters sure deviates from their original comics counterparts, as was to be expected but necessarily appreciated. Similarly to Silver Samurai now being a robot-armour instead of a kinetically charged mutant in shiny, traditional Nippon warrior garb, Viper has transformed from a typical assassin dabbling in assorted toxins to a full fledged snake like mutant, complete with silly forked tongue, the ability to spit poison and skin shedding issues. The only character who stands out next to the ass-kicking Wolverine himself is the tough, lite and wise-cracking Yukio, both dangerous and playful, who brings some much needed lightheartedness in an otherwise all too dramatic and emotionally heavy superhero film. The Wolverine is only a minor improvement over Logan's previous solo adventure X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009). Though more room is given for Logan's personal turmoil, the side characters for the most part aren't as colourful and compelling this time around, nor is the action delivered in a diverse manner to keep capturing the audience's imagination. Nevertheless, the short teaser for the next X-flick, next year's X-Men: Days of Future Past, wedged in halfway into the end credits, sure makes the levels of anticipation rise tremendously, considering what other popular characters make a comeback."

","After the disappointing X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Hugh Jackman is back on the big screen reprising his famous Wolverine role. 'The Wolverine' was initially meant to be directed by Darren Aronofsky - he even re-wrote the screenplay and aimed for a R-rating. However, after his departure, we got James Mangold's PG-13 version of 'The Wolverine'. Which is really a shame, since a movie like this truly deserves a R-rating. 'The Wolverine' surely is better than the aforementioned movies, but that isn't saying much. The movie is still underwhelming and full of flaws, the PG-13 rating being one of them.<br/><br/>'The Wolverine' continues where X-Men: The Last Stand ended. Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who now looks like Jesus, feels guilty about killing Jean Grey aka Phoenix (Famke Janssen). He aimlessly lives his life and often has visions of Jean. One day he meets Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a somewhat strange Japanese girl who invites him to Japan to visit his old friend Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) because he is dying. There, because of some Sci-Fi mumbo jumbo, Logan is deprived of his superpowers. Weakened like that, he is forced to fight yakuza, samurai, ninjas and other Japanese stuff, while seeking a way to regain his superpowers and trying to solve the mystery surrounding the Yashida family.<br/><br/>Due to the 2 hours length and poor editing, 'The Wolverine' is a quite boring movie. It is shot in intervals: first, there are pretty long intervals where nothing significant happens, and then this are compensated with intervals of too long action scenes. This kind of editing made the movie feel tiresome. Furthermore, 'The Wolverine' has a serious villain problem. There are just too many of them, and the majority are left completely undeveloped. The screenwriters should have left one or two of them out of the movie, and focus more on the rest. Also, the love story between Logan and Yashida's daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) was completely uncalled for and made little sense in the movie's story. Logan had much more chemistry with Yukio than with Mariko and she should have been Logan's new love interest, in case he absolutely needed one. Besides, establishing Logan's guilt because of the murder of his love, Jean, is useless if during the course of the movie he bones the first sexy Asian chick he meets. And of course, like I said before, in the world of samurai, katanas and wolverine claws, a R-rating and some Tarantino-esque violence is a must.<br/><br/>Still, all of this doesn't mean that 'The Wolverine' is an absolute failure. I liked how the movie has a more serious, darker tone, than the Origins movie. The mystery regarding the Yashida family was also plausible (in spite of some obvious twists) and some jokes in the movie weren't as bad as one might expect. I particularly enjoyed the first act of the movie, before it went dull. 'The Wolverine' surely isn't disastrous, it has its good moments from time to time. I think it will satisfy the majority of its audience, especially the ones who were utterly disappointed with the Origins movie. Actually, it was quite nice to see Logan have some limitations and still fight his enemies. it would have been even nicer if his enemies were somewhat better written.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"
"quicksticks","7","0","1","4 September 2013"," Impressive action scenes in the latest X-Men series offering
","WHEN a South African makes it big in Hollywood, I'm often extremely proud of their achievement. From Arnold Vosloo playing the ""badie"" in almost everything that he stars in, to a farm girl from Benoni winning an Oscar, and more recently Sharlto Copley and Neil Blomkamp being a part of one the best science fictions to date — South Africans have made their mark in Tinsel Town. However, when Johannesburg-born director Gavin Hood took the helm of X- Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009, it was less impressive, and that is an understatement. Fan boys were eager to see something better than Brett Ratner's piece of rubbish X-Men: The Last Stand in 2006, but Hood didn't deliver the goods. But thankfully in 2011 Matthew Vaughn brought back the series standards when X-Men: First Class stunned audiences around the globe. Now James Mangold — the director who brought us Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma (2007) — gets into the driver's seat to try to keep up the pace Vaughn brought to the X-Men series. The story take place after the events of The Last Stand, with a flashback to the atomic bombing of Nagasaki during World War 2, and, not giving anything away, this scene really gets your attention with a mix of emotion, good acting and a pinch of digital computer wizardry. Fast-forward to present day and we see Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) living in the wilderness and being comforted by the ghost of his last love. He then finds himself on his way to Japan where the dying owner of the country's biggest technology company wants to repay the favour — by giving Wolverine an ""honourable death"". Wolverine gets caught up in a family dispute, and ultimately has to protect the tech-giant's granddaughter — and all the while he has to deal with not having the healing powers that he has been using his whole life. In a ""summer film"" aimed at teenagers and young adults, the action scenes are very important. This is where the director gets the job done, as the first major action scene is pretty far into the movie. The build- up with regards development is far more important, especially with a character-driven film like The Wolverine. Stand-out scenes include a fight on top of a bullet train, and a ninja assault on the family's home. However, in the third act this film becomes very predictable and then turns into the standard-issue formula of any superhero film. It is a nice change to have a film set in Japan, where the modern city- scape as well as the beautiful countryside with its traditional and cultural aspects, are showcased. There are a few jokes not suitable for children but it's nice that the film caters for older viewers, with Wolverine slicing and dicing his enemies with his adamantium claws."
"tieman64","Null","0","1","23 August 2013"," Bring back Bryan Singer
","James Mangold's ""The Wolverine"" opens with its best sequence. Here the Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), an adamantium clawed superhero with remarkable healing powers, finds himself in a Japanese prison cell during the Allied atomic bombings of Nagasaki. When the bomb falls, most of Nagasaki is incinerated, with the exception of our hero, who valiantly shields a Japanese soldier with his body.<br/><br/>After this sequence, the film slides into more generic territory. Jumping ahead several decades, it finds the Wolverine alone and exploring the wilderness of North America. Here he encounters a woman who informs him that the Japanese soldier he once protected is dying. Wolverine thus returns to Japan, at which point he finds himself embroiled in a gang war.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, action scenes in action movies were exciting. Now they're largely overlong, dull and it's the quieter moments of action films which audiences seem hungry for. In ""The Wolverine"", these quieter moments largely involve Jackman rummaging about Japan or exploring the wilderness all on his lonesome. These are all cool sequences, and lend the film the tone of a slow, brooding, albeit superficial character study. Less cool are the film's intended cool sequences, in which Jackman battles Japanese gangsters during a funeral, on top of a train (De Palma's ""Mission Impossible"" climax on cocaine), and finally a giant robot in a mountain castle. These supposedly cool action sequences are all overlong, goofy and horribly directed, but they're what we've come to expect from films burdened by the demands of the mass market, blockbuster.<br/><br/>This is all in stark contrast to how director Bryan Singer, and most of the better ""X-Men"" comics, handled Wolverine. Wolverine is best when he's kept at a distance and when his violence is hinted at, brief or never shown directly. With the Wolverine character, less in more. In contrast, Mangold mistakes excess for entertainment.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the film reads like a checklist of what Westerners think Japan is like. WW2 soldier? Check. Kimonos? Check. Seppuku? Check. Rich elderly businessman? Check. Workaholic father who neglects his family? Check. Goth Asian girl with wacky fashion sense? Check. Traditional girl? Check. Duty-bound warrior? Check. Sleazy Japanese businessman? Check. Yakuza? Check. Cutting edge technology companies? Check. Shinto monk? Check. Atomic bomb? Check. The film's climax is equally perfunctory, Wolverine battling a giant CGI robot because, hey, that's how all modern blockbusters are supposed to end.<br/><br/>7/10 – Worth one viewing."

The action was fun just like any other x- men, but I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters like I did in any of the other movies. Some parts of the movie also seemed too predictable and a bit cheesy. I don't wanna bash on the film, cause I enjoyed it and thought it was good, but it could have been much better. If you like superhero movies as much as any other geek at heart, watch it. It has really cool action scenes and you might even laugh a few times.

I won't spoil you have to watch to see why.Its needles to say that beginning and end are like whole two new different plots and oh man its so bad.But on the other hand not all things are bad,there are some touchy scenes that can surprise you,Hugh Jackman (Logan)gave his best and save this movie in my opinion.Because of few rare events in the movie that are done surprisingly well,Hugh Jackman and because Wolverine is one of my favourite heroes in Marvel universe i will give it 6."

Although you can spot that final twist a mile off Mark Bomback and Scott Frank's screenplay rolls out an interesting action packed bodyguard yarn for the first half.

There's guns, sword play and stabbings with some finely executed martial arts on display.

Actress Tao Okamoto is Logan's love interest Mariko and Rila Fukushima appears as Yukio, Logan's 'bodyguard' both are on fine form.

","Ever since Hugh Jackman's debut as the Wolverine in X-Men, back in 2002, it was clear he was not just good at the performance - he was made for it. Thus, movie director Gavin Hood was hired to anchor spin off 'X-Men Origins Wolverine'; it was rather bland with boring characters but Jackman's acting was impeccable and the action sequences pleased. <br/><br/>Years later we have, 'The Wolverine.' A piece based on Frank Miller's graphic work, set after the events of the main X-Men trilogy. Jackman's Logan (alias to Wolverine) is a recluse, living on the edge as you may gather with his thick, bushy beard and scruffy general appearance. To his surprise a female ninja warrior (Rila Fukushima) whisks him away to Tokyo, Japan following her master's orders (Hal Yamanouchi). Her master is willing to reward Logan for originally saving his life - during a civil war in the past - by trading immortality for mortality. However, when Logan refuses, he then becomes protector to his grand daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) who is being sought by highly trained assassins.<br/><br/>'The Wolverine' lasts 126 minutes in duration; for approximately 90-95 minutes it had me intrigued. Action takes a back seat for story and character development which is great and when the sequences of action do arise they are excellent. One scene in particular where Logan battles with numerous Japanese assassins on a bullet train looks and feels exhilarating. The cast all perform with solidity.<br/><br/>By faults come in the final quarter or so of the film (90-95 minutes plus) when the story refracts off into a different direction in a pointless bid to extend the running time. It follows the villainous plots of Svetlana Khodchenkova's character Viper. Again she performs well in her role but is a pointless character which doesn't add anything to the main plot, just extends the running time. <br/><br/>Entailed in that final quarter is a flurry of action sequences that feel as if they have been forced in. It quickly becomes tiresome and this long, ponderous final half an hour (or so) becomes a little ridiculous, particularly with a twist many will struggle to find the logic behind.<br/><br/>Excellent for a larger portion than it is not, 'The Wolverine' can just about stand on its own two feet without Jackman carrying the entirety on his shoulders."
"jackson-peng","6","0","1","11 August 2013"," For those unread in the source material, stay away...
","Oh my, where to begin...<br/><br/>Okay so first I am aware that prior experience with the source material is conducive to increased enjoyment of this movie. I have only seen the X-men movies and have not read the comics, so this review will be given from a purely objective perspective of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is not smart, but rather the exact opposite. You can't even try to figure out the goings-ons because they literally chuck it at you like a baseball at every plot turn. But that's expected for a 'standard' superhero action flick, right? So I won't go on about that. As for the action, I found it to be rather unfulfilling. There weren't an excessive amount of fight scenes as I had hoped, and virtually no gore other than in the scenes where it shows Wolverine's injuries. The fights were not imaginative when Wolverine was involved as he just hacked and slashed, but I have to give props for some of the Katana choreography which was very well done in my opinion. The action was not realistic, of course, but it was literally just not believable; the 'goons' with semi-automatic pistols only fired 1 bullet at close range, and just decided to stand there while they got cut down by an already slow and weakened Wolverine. With a bit more creative effort, fight choreography could easily make the fight scenes more believable.<br/><br/>And if you just intended to give this a look-see for the action, boy I wish you good luck when you go through all the filler 'romance' that happens in the middle and the cringe-worthy banter between Logan and the red haired bodyguard. The dialog is abhorrent. I wouldn't be at all surprised if a fanfic writer in the 11th grade spent 5 minutes writing whatever came to his mind for the dialog between Jackman and most of the other characters. It's somewhere along the lines of the awkward small talk you have when you bump into someone you're barely familiar with at the grocery store. I did not find any of the banter even somewhat humorous, minus maybe 2 parts in the whole film; it did not meet the standards of the most basic Hollywood humor. Mangold also tried to develop a romance in the middle of the movie which takes about 30 minutes to pass. It's appallingly trite, made worse by the fabricated Asian bad-English accent of Mariko.<br/><br/>Jackman's acting was... on point. He made it work with the script he had, and so did the other characters. The father of Mariko in my opinion delivered his lines the best - he really sounded convincing whenever he spoke. Ms. Khodchenkova on the other hand did try to give a candid performance, but to no avail due to the pedestrian dialog she was given.<br/><br/>The movie gets some points for cinematography and camera-work, which was done moderately well. All the shots were clear, well paced, and presented the action well especially during faster scenes such as the katana fights.<br/><br/>Overall, I did not have a good experience with this movie. I did not enjoy it, but my father and my little sister apparently did. You may or may not enjoy the action, but just keep in mind that there is not enough to overshadow the unbearable altercations and silly plot directions that take up more than half of the screen time."

"jadepietro","7","0","1","10 August 2013"," A Wolf (Six) Pack
","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>The Wolfman is back, all ripped abs and muscles bulging, with hirsute chest and hands of steel and a hot-blooded temper to match. Marvel's favorite mutant, Wolverine, takes center stage again in his second solo feature, aptly titled The Wolverine, an action adventure movie that is strong on action but not very adventurous in its story. The film clearly follows a tried and true formula and rarely breaks away from it, although there is a nice twist toward the end of the film.<br/><br/>James Mangold directs this installment with mixed results, mostly positive. The director competently stages the set pieces with enough excitement and energy, although some of the filming and editing is far too close-up and, pardon the pun, choppy. Some of the CGI is highly effective, like a wonderful chase sequence aboard a fast-moving train (the film's best scene). But at times, the visual effects completely miss the mark, as in an earlier sequence involving the more noticeable appearance of an artificial looking bear that could give Yogi some competition. The director also tries to build some character development and complicated plotting in his film which is rare for this type of genre. Unfortunately, the screenplay and dialog by Mark Bombard and Scott Frank never really connects with the goings-on and chases.<br/><br/>The plot goes something like this: Wolverine is all angst-ridden and is summoned to visit a Japanese ex-soldier whose life he once saved. It is there that Wolverine is asked to protect his granddaughter, Mariko, from harm as he fights the Yakuza and other sinister forces, even though our superhero is beginning to show signs of weakening power and mortality. <br/><br/>Of course, without Hugh Jackman perfectly cast as its superhero, there could not be a viable franchise. The actor is such a valuable commodity and the main reason for viewing this film. (There are certainly plenty of opportunities to see Jackman shirtless or in the buff and the filmmakers have enough gratuitous shots to please his doting admirers, both male and female alike. There are also enough action sequences to satisfy comic book aficionados as well.) Jackman invests in this role and his commanding presence gives the film some plausibility.<br/><br/>Yet it's the down time in between the action sequences that tend to slow down the film a bit. Characters are introduced without any real definition and their motives and actions seems suspect or they appear evil from the start with no credible explanation. (Any savvy moviegoer will know one of the villains is a walking stereotype, obviously bad from the onset due to her coiffure and stylish appearance.)<br/><br/>The actors play their parts earnestly and it's refreshing to see that the movie was filmed on location in Japan and utilized native actors for the roles. Tao Okamoto is Mariko and Rila Fukushima plays Wolverine's martial arts sidekick. Both actresses efficiently deliver the necessary drama to the proceedings and have a fine chemistry with Jackman throughout the film. <br/><br/>The Wolverine doesn't bite off more than it can chew. It's well-made, entertaining, yet nondescript. It is again just another one of the many comic book movies that we've seen countless times before. The movie left me wanting more. My expectations were higher and I was still...hungry...like a wolf, for a more satisfying movie-going experience that The Wolverine never accomplished for me. GRADE: B-<br/><br/>NOTE: The PG-13 rating seems off the mark too with so much blood, violence, and profanity on display.

"Wuchakk","6","0","1","10 August 2013"," Atypical superhero movie
","""The Wolverine"" (2013) takes place after ""X-Men 3: The Last Stand"" (2006) and focuses on Logan in Japan. It's reminiscent of Chris Claremont & Frank Miller's original 1982 4-part Wolverine miniseries.<br/><br/>Like that miniseries, the film is very atypical for comic book superheroes. It plays out more like a James Bond flick, sort of a modern version of ""You Only Live Twice"", than a conventional superhero flick. Logan (Hugh Jackman) never appears in an outlandish costume, nor do any other characters, except Viper, and hers isn't all that outlandish.<br/><br/>The beginning is great -- the World War II prologue and the Yukon sequences. I also enjoyed the Japanese locations and culture, as well as the focus on drama mixed with stellar bouts of comic book action. Unfortunately, I found the story only moderately interesting, which is the main reason I rate the film as mediocre as I do. It just isn't all that captivating.<br/><br/>I really liked the character of Yukio (Rila Fukushima), and Hiroyuki Sanada makes a quality antagonist, but I found Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) rather bland. The Silver Samurai also appears in an armored suit a la Iron Man or War Machine and comes across as typical for this type of fare.<br/><br/>In addition, Famke Janssen appears as Jean Grey. She's fine in the role, but she never tripped my trigger. The best lookin' woman in the entire film, believe it or not, is the cashier who talks to Logan briefly in Yukon.<br/><br/>I'll be honest with you, I thought 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was better than this one. Despite the cartoony opening, it had more depth and was way more compelling. Still, ""The Wolverine"" is a solid depiction of Wolverine's adventures in Japan.<br/><br/>The film runs 2 hours and 6 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+ or B-"
"TravS94","8","0","1","10 August 2013"," The Wolverine
","PLOT: After the death of Jean Grey (The Phoenix), Wolverine leaves the X-Men to live in the wilderness with no real idea of what to do next. He lives with no real purpose. Soon though, he is invited to Japan to accept a gift from the man he saved when the atomic bomb landed on Hiroshima back during World War II. When he gets there, mysterious things happen that cause him to lose his mutant healing ability. Logan must now find answers and find out what is wrong before it's too late.<br/><br/>MY THOUGHTS: Walking into this film, I knew it would not hold up to the other X-Men films due to the simple fact that this one takes place in Japan. I also questioned who would be the main adversary to Wolverine in this picture. Would it be Lady Deathstrike? Or Maybe even the Silver Samurai? But no, what we were given was a Silver Samurai like take on it with a twist. I believe the film had very good special effects (aside from the bear), and the atomic bomb flashback was amazing. However, I did think the film lacked in some parts and in a way, it slowed down the movie. Many things puzzled me too like how a robot insect-like thing could take away a genetic power, and how using two hands activated the adamantium sword at the end when clearly the robot was using one.<br/><br/>PROS/CONS: The special effects were amazing. Like always, you believed the claws were actually there and the flashback from WWII was by far the best CG used in the movie. You got a glimpse of what the healing factor did from all that radiation. Some characters in the movie were kind of boring and useless such as the archer guy and Viper, but nonetheless, the movie was decent.<br/><br/>OVERALL: 7/10"

","Let me first say that I'm a fan of superhero movies, The Wolverine definitely belongs to the superhero category! However I found the story in this particular movie a bit disappointing, it's a little far-fetched, even for a fictional world with super-powered mutants. None the less, the acting by Hugh is splendid, and Famke, as short as her role was in this movie, did a great job as well. The visual effects were great as well, no comments on that. I personally found the after-credits scene more exciting then the movie itself, but that could be my personal preference for the main storyline of the X-men universe. Overall it's a good movie with great visual effects, and remember to stay after the credits!"

","I have no idea how to write a review for a superhero movie, but I thought that The Wolverine was a good enough film to warrant an attempt.<br/><br/>The Wolverine keeps you on the edge of your seat for nearly every second of the film. After an atomic set of dream sequences where Logan witnesses the bombing of Nagasaki in World War Two, we find Logan living in the forest, in what is wrongly identified as ""present-day Alaska"" by New York Times critic A.O Scott. It is clearly the Yukon Canada, as identified by The Yukon Sportsman's Paradise sign in an early scene. Having abandoned his life as a crime fighter, it doesn't take long before the action starts, and Logan gets drawn back into his old kick-ass ways.<br/><br/>Very early the film departs North America for Japan, and stays there for the rest of the time. The sets designs are spectacular, the photography obviously expensive and flawless. Shots of everything Japanese give the film an exotic flare, which then of course allows for every single character to be a martial arts expert. The fights scenes are visibly momentous, the special effects outstanding.<br/><br/>There are some gut-wrenching flaws though that are hard to stomach amidst the film's greatness: Logan and his side-kick Yukio are both highlighted riding motorcycles through the snow in the middle of Japanese winter; the sexy Viper villain has no discernible point as a character, neither do her costumes; the scene from the trailer where Logan is standing smoking his trademark cigar disappointingly does not appear in the film.<br/><br/>Yet the overarching theme dealing with Logan's angst causing immortality is interesting enough to easily redeem the film. Wolverine doesn't save the world here, but he fights to protect the life of one woman, and ends up fighting just to save his own.<br/><br/>More reviews drumgodchris.blogspot.com"

","By the time Viper, a beautiful blonde vixen with unearthly powers, unleashes a forked tongue, spitting colorful venom on her targets, the entire purpose of having THE WOLVERINE take place in the super-slick modern day Tokyo, resembling a Noirish Ninja thriller, is somewhat diminished – everything seemed so ultra-real beforehand. <br/><br/>And yet, because of her input alone, our hero's having a more difficult time than usual: feeling vulnerable and human in the process. He's even suffering bad dreams about former lover Jean Gray, obviously meant to tie the other X-MEN films together but seeming like unnecessary (and corny) intrusions.<br/><br/>The plot is very basic: Wolverine is hired to save the granddaughter of a dying man he saved during the Second World War. She's targeted by the Asian mob i.e. The Yukuza, leading to fast-paced action scenes, like one atop a speeding bullet train, which, although fun and involving, are wedged between prolonged bouts of filler dialogue and a superfluous romance.<br/><br/>The handsome cinematography resembles a stylistic graphic novel, especially as we journey from the crowded city to a pale moonlight fortress, but the turnout, ultimately revealing the main villain in a fist-pounding finale, is downright anticlimactic: by the end you'll realize there wasn't much behind even the most memorable sequences."

It's like they took the concept of an ultra masculine, ultra hard, impossibly tough mofo and neutered him.<br/><br/>I especially liked the scene where good ol' Hugh sucks his tummy in (which there is no apparent need for), the scene where even though he loses his powers, approximately ten bullets don't seem to do him much harm, the scene where he manages to leap from building to building like superman (but without his powers) and the stupid ass, pointless let down of an ending that left me thinking 'admantium shmantium' my kids could have kicked their collective asses.<br/><br/>After the Diabolical last film and the idiocy that was the last stand, I expected so much from this film and it squarely misses the mark. Women will rave about Hugh Jackman no doubt, but personally even f there had been a naked superhumanly attractive female in 90% of the film, it still wouldn't have made me think for a second that it was any good.<br/><br/>There are a couple of excellent scenes (Ninjas yay) and that weird Japanese triangle head woman kept me wanting to watch to see if her head changed shape to normal, but other than that there isn't much to write home about.<br/><br/>I nearly peed' my pants in the opening 5 minutes, apparently as long as you are in a well, then fallout and radiation doesn't harm humans after half an hour or so . . . . . . .<br/><br/>I'm going to begrudgingly give this a 3 out of 5, and consequently refuse to watch it again, unless its on DVD or SKY, Im asleep and my kids beg me to watch it."
"moviexclusive","Null","0","2","24 July 2013"," Punctuating periods of slow development with over-the-top action, this solo outing for Wolverine at least helps whet your appetite for the next X-Men ensemble film
","The Wolverine backstory is a natural spin off from the (mostly) celebrated X-Men film trilogy: not only is he a favourite among fanboys and females, but his origins, temperament and near-invincible mutant powers present endless possibilities for a tortured protagonist. After all, how do you beat an immortal mutant armed with adamantium claws, accelerated healing, and enhanced physical/ sensory capabilities?<br/><br/>This year's ""The Wolverine"" explores the answers to that question. Based off a popular 1982 Marvel comic book arc, writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank created another one-off digression from the ensemble movies. It's an attempt to skip past the unimpressive solo episode back in 2009 that was the Gavin Hood-directed ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", which despite having intriguing characters like Deadpool and Gambit, managed to fall flat.<br/><br/>The movie picks up from when we last saw Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), grieving over having to kill the love of his life, the powerful telekinetic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who had been possessed by the Dark Phoenix in 2006's ""X Men: The Last Stand"". Broken down, he lives alone on the fringes of society, making his bed in the Yukon wilds and spending sleepless nights dreaming about Jean, who appears in multiple sequences in a diaphanous negligee looking and sounding completely out of character. She's his id, personifying his guilt and suicidal inclinations. Logan identifies most closely with a random grizzly bear that ends up getting killed by a poisoned arrow, an incident that is likely a shadowy foretelling of the remainder of the story.<br/><br/>Logan subsequently crosses paths with Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a katana- wielding Japanese girl with precognition powers who's tracked him down. She informs him that her employer Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi / Ken Yamamura), a man he once saved in World War II from the atomic bomb at Nagasaki, is dying and would like to say farewell. After some persuasion, he agrees to a short sojourn to Tokyo.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Yashida is a patriarch of a wealthy family with a formidable business empire that engages in significant power play. He extends the offer of taking Logan's accelerated healing powers, positioning it as a generous move since he believes the Wolverine has a death wish. Understandably, our protagonist turns him down, and when Yashida passes away, he becomes the bodyguard of the old man's graceful granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto), who's suddenly being hunted down by yakuza from every direction. An unfortunate encounter with a slinky nemesis and her poisoned tongue, Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), leaves Logan with suppressed powers – now he feels the aftermath of every gunshot, the wounds no longer close in a matter of seconds and loss of blood drains his energy.<br/><br/>Here's where you appreciate Wolverine's feral tenacity at its most inspiring: In spite of the pain, he gets up as many times as he falls down, and he doesn't give in even when he's out of depth. Presented with the very real possibility of mortality, with Mariko's and Yukio's help he begins to see the value in moving forward to create a worthwhile future. What unfolds subsequently will not surprise many, and the pacing at times can be trying for those just weaning off recent heavy-action flicks.<br/><br/>Japan is, as always, gorgeous on the big screen, pulsing with colour and brimming with a distinct eclectic style. This time though, director James Mangold's choice of sets feels like a travelogue to the Land of Rising Sun. Pachinko parlours, bullet trains, love hotels, seedy backstreets and an obligatory shot of the iconic Tokyo Tower give the film a glossy sheen but undermine its substance. Hollywood's fascination with ninjas and samurai feels perfunctory when treated without sufficient care. Even the action scenes end up laughable when you consider how ludicrous most of it actually is. While newcomer Fukushima stands out for her tough-girl performance and finesse with a katana, the supporting cast is mostly unmemorable.<br/><br/>In spite of this, Hugh Jackman demonstrates on his sixth screen outing as the Wolverine the power of perfect casting. Intense and effortlessly athletic, he metes out violence with believably ferocity while convincingly portraying the character's underlying emotional angst and suffering. Yet it is the post-end credits scene that is most ticket price-worthy: it may even make you realise how unsatisfying the movie you've just watched is."

After X-Men The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine I was expecting an action film that left me longing for a great X-Men film. My reservations toward the Wolverine are completely valid after they killed my dreams of Deadpool on film. I'm happy to say, the Wolverine didn't let me down.<br/><br/>The action within the film is good and you see Wolverine moving how you expect him to move and acting like the character we love from the Marvel comics and the story was really good and made sense within the X-Men universe. The characters felt worked out and believable throughout most of the film.<br/><br/>The only character I wasn't very happy with was Svetlana Khodchenkova acting ability as Viper. Every line she spoke felt fake and forced. The sense you get from her in the film is simply ""I'm pretty, I'm sexy, I can say words and you'll love me."" That attempt in acting didn't connect her to the rest of the cast or with the audience.<br/><br/>Luckily, Hugh Jackson saves the film from Svetlana's bad acting.

","""The Wolverine"" (12A) Director: James Mangold. Starring: Hugh Jackman, Will Yun Lee, Tao Okamoto and Brian Tee. Rated: 12A, for containing moderate action violence and one use of strong language. Running time: 126 minutes. Out now in UK cinemas.<br/><br/>Many years after the events of ""The Last Stand"", we learn that the Wolverine has become a drifter. Moving from town to town, seeking justice where he can deliver it. One night, after a fight in a bar; the Wolverine meets Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a skilled samurai swordsman who asks Wolverine to journey with her to Tokyo, to meet the dying man that he saved during world war two. On arriving, Wolverine is given a chance to become mortal; declaring no, he is poisoned and is plunged into a life or death battle to become immortal once again.<br/><br/>Tuesday the 30th of July. It was finally my chance to watch ""The Wolverine"". From what I had heard (by other critics), ""The Wolverine"" was in some respects, a critical failure. So, due to these verdicts, I built the assumption that I was not going enjoy it and probably end up awarding it a low rating. That, however is not the case.<br/><br/>Instead, I was actually quite surprised at the efforts of ""The Wolverine"". Compared to it's predecessor (""X Men Origins: Wolverine""), it had improved greatly. Here, Wolverine is given a chance to develop his character, whereas last time large amounts of mutants were introduced to keep the story interesting; which didn't really work. <br/><br/>The film begins fairly slow, but as the story progresses, it begins to pick up the pace quite dramatically. When Wolverine arrives in Tokyo, it's not too long before he's busy stabbing and smashing his way through hordes of Chinese mafia. <br/><br/>The film continues to put it's audience through various set pieces that are quite inventive. For instance, the fight scene on top of the Japanese Bullet train, is funny and creative; swapping ludicrous action for a more realistic tone. <br/><br/>Here, I couldn't help but feel, the ""The Wolverine"" was similar to the popular Jason Statham film; ""Crank"". They have almost the same plot-line and both share the same tone. Despite it's similarities, ""The Wolverine"" is aimed at people of a younger audience, which pushes (in my opinion) the 12A rating. <br/><br/>As ""The Wolverine"" continues however, it begins to disappoint. The 3D effects are quite worthless for the film, as they are not used to their full potential. The CGI is also quite disappointing, for example the fight scene inside the large medical centre is very shaky.<br/><br/>It's the stars of the film that save it from failing. Hugh Jackman steps into a more personal role this time round, and acts perfectly well, cracking some good one-liners here and there. First time actors Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukushima, both act to quite a high standard considering it is their first feature length film. <br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, ""The Wolverine"" has been delivered well, whilst trying to avoid the plot-holes of its predecessor. It has succeeded, to a degree. <br/><br/>6 stars out of ten = Good.<br/><br/>Written by Scott Gentry."

Let's not forget about this cast though. They really deliver. Sure the depth and lead up are complex and enjoyable but does get any better then the final showdown and conclusion? <br/><br/>Critics are saying that this may be the year's best superhero movie because, for a sufficient amount of time, it doesn't feel like a superhero movie at all.

"The-Sarkologist","7","0","3","3 August 2013"," Okay, but not one of the best X-men movies
","I was sort of wondering whether this film was set between X-Men Origins and the first X-men movie but it seems that it was actually set after The Last Stand (which is probably why Gene was making an appearance). However it is interesting to suggest that Gene and Logan had an affair because it does not seem that it had occurred in the movies, namely because after Scott Summers died Gene Grey pretty much went mad with power, though it is the case that Logan was the one that eventually killed her, and it was with her claws.<br/><br/>The film begins with Logan trapped in a hole in a Japanese POW camp and manages to survive the nuclear blast, along with a single Japanese officer. This was a little odd because in X-men Origins we was fighting on the beaches of Normandy with his brother, and had been with his brother until the mid-sixties, but here he is alone and on the opposite side of the world (though it is possible for him to get over there in the time between Normandy and Nagasaki).<br/><br/>Basically the Japanese officer who he saved has become a very powerful corporate boss and invites Logan over to Japan to say farewell to him before he dies, however it turns out that he has a much more sinister plan at work, though this is not revealed until later in the film because the film seems to try to create a mysterious world of plots and counter plots, and also muddying the waters as to who the bad guy is and who isn't. Mind you, I suspected that the old man hadn't died because the mutant who has the power to see people's death says 'strange, I didn't see his death'. It became pretty clear after that that the old man hadn't died.<br/><br/>This was an okay movie, and a reasonable addition to the X-men movie (though continuity is a bit of a problem, though it is not a massive reboot). Unlike the other movies, there are only three other mutants in this film, the girl who can see people's deaths, Viper, and the Silver Samurai (which isn't strictly a mutant because the person who is the Silver Samurai was not born with any superpowers). It also, as is expected with Marvel movies of late, that after the initial credits there is an introduction to the next movie in the series, which seems to have a resurrected Professor X and a Magneto who has his powers back."
"chandan0026","6","0","3","2 August 2013"," More or less based on the series, but almost completely changed including only good climax.
","One of the hardest things about reviewing movies is being objective, especially if one is familiar with and fond of original source material. For example, I love the four-issue ""Wolverine"" comic book mini-series written by Chris Claremont, drawn by Frank Miller and published in 1982. This is one of my all-time favorite comics. James Mangold's new movie The Wolverine is more or less based on this series, but almost completely changed. Claremont doesn't even get a ""story by"" credit.<br/><br/>Now my job is to decide whether The Wolverine is a good movie despite those changes, or even perhaps because of them. Considering the changes on their own, they start to sound pretty stupid, designed more for summer blockbuster purposes than to serve the story.<br/><br/>First up is the inclusion of a supervillain, Viper (played by a slinky blonde Russian with a pert nose, Svetlana Khodchenkova). What she's actually doing in the story, who she's working for and what her agenda is, are all up for interpretation. Next we have a giant robot that fights Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) during the big climax, plus a ""surprise"" reveal when we find out who is inside it.<br/><br/>Then there's a long sequence wherein Wolverine (also known as Logan) loses his super-healing ability and suffers mortal wounds, just like the rest of us. This idea was also attempted in Superman II, perhaps as a way to get the audience to ""identify"" with the superhero a bit more, but it really doesn't work. Plus the filmmakers seem to have forgotten that it's this healing ability that allows Wolverine to unsheathe his claws, which tear through his skin each time.<br/><br/>Aside from these blunders, the rest of the characters just don't seem the same. In the original comic, Wolverine has already met and fallen in love with Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and goes to Japan to rescue her from an arranged marriage, but must navigate a complex web of honor and duty in his dealings with Mariko's father Shinghen.<br/><br/>Now there's a whole plot about Wolverine going to Japan to meet up with Mariko's grandfather, whom he saved during the Nagasaki bombing. He doesn't even meet Mariko until he gets there. The grandfather's big plan is to steal Wolverine's healing power. When assassins try to kill Mariko during the old man's funeral (for no apparent reason), Wolvie rescues her and they go on the run together while falling in love.<br/><br/>In the comic, a feisty assassin called Yukio falls for Wolverine, but betrays him. She's here, too, but pretty much as window dressing (played by Rila Fukushima). She more or less tags along with him now and fights the secondary bad guys. Also, Wolverine occasionally suffers from nightmares where he speaks to Jean Grey (Famke Janssen).<br/><br/>The movie's opening follows the comic book's -- Wolverine stalking an injured bear -- but it, too is changed just a bit to fit Wolverine's ""crisis-of-conscience."" (He's not going to be violent anymore.) So whereas the comic book's opening was dramatic and suspenseful, here it becomes more of a coincidence.<br/><br/>Mangold has become a pretty good craftsman, especially when it comes to low-stakes genre films. He was at his best on 3:10 to Yuma (2007), and both Identity (2003) and Knight and Day (2010) had their good points. However, on The Wolverine, he appears checked out. The action sequences feel obligatory (and shaky) and the needless 3D effects don't help much. It definitely starts to slog after about an hour.<br/><br/>Jackman is probably the movie's high point. He was always a great casting choice for Wolverine, and he makes an appealingly tormented, tough character. It's just that he has no one remotely interesting to play off of, and a fairly uninteresting plot to wade through.<br/><br/>Even so, fans will be relieved that The Wolverine is better than both X- Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and Brett Ratner's X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), even if it's not as good as the other three films in this series (X-Men, X2: X-Men United, and X-Men: First Class). Not exactly glowing praise, but at least I can always go back and re-read the comic book"

","The Wolverine is a spin-off to the X-Men franchise that tells the story of what happens with Wolverine after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand.

When Wolverine arrives, it is revealed that something else is going on entirely ... which I won't get into.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was pretty solid. It had a great set-up and some really good characters. But compared to the other X-Men movies, this one is a little bit on the weaker side. The fun with the X-Men movies is to see all these different mutants with crazy abilities fight alongside and against each other. In this movie, there are only three mutants, Wolverine included. This is disappointing, especially since every X-Men movie has contained lots of cool and varied mutants. Even X-Men Origins: Wolverine did that.<br/><br/>The villains are not that interesting. They're just bland Hollywood villains that we see in every generic action movie. Wolverine himself is a very cool character, and he does some bad-ass things. Some action scenes are really cool, like a scene involving a bullet train. But then we have more traditional fight scenes, which are boring because you can't see what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>Now I'm gonna talk about the after-credits scene. And don't worry, I'm not gonna spoil what it is. Rather, I'm gonna spoil what it isn't. For those who think it means that Wolverine is joining The Avengers: Age of Ultron, he isn't. That's a little disappointing, 'cause I was almost certain it would be that. But it's still a really cool scene that will make a lot of X-Men fans happy.<br/><br/>Overall, The Wolverine is a pretty cool movie. It has a couple really cool action scenes, a great protagonist and a cool setting. Though some parts are uninteresting (especially during the last part), it's still a fun ride.

X-Men 2 topped that, becoming one of the finest comic related movies still to this day. Unfortunately, that's when X-Men: Last Stand came out. <br/><br/>Helmed by a new director (Brett Ratner, infamous in Hollywood for his mediocrity), Last Stand basically flushed the X-Men legacy down the toilet. Armed with memes and the audacity to murder off prominent members of the X- Men lineup, the X-Men movies came to a halt. <br/><br/>In '09, Wolverine had his first solo outing, X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It was, in a word, terrible. <br/><br/>After seeing those two duds, I was not excited for X-Men: First Class, but went to see it anyway. It was surprisingly good, and brought life back to the X-crew. Finally, the series had a pulse. Now, in 2013, in anticipation of X-Men: Days of Future Past, comes The Wolverine. <br/><br/>First, the cast. Hugh Jackman has never looked better as Logan. He worked hard to get in shape for this role (even employing help from The Rock), and it really showed. The rest of the supporting cast is sufficient, but does not stand out.<br/><br/>The direction was sufficient by James Mangold. I can only dream about what may have been with Darren Arronofsky at the helm. He had worked on the film and script for 6 months, but wanted a much darker, rated R film, which the studio did not want. Shame. Could have been amazing, and much closer to the comics. <br/><br/>Overall, I liked this movie, but I liked it to the point that I probably wouldn't watch it again. There was one scene that really stood out as being amazing - a fight along a bullet train that happens near the beginning of the story. It was simply breathtaking, and one of those scenes that will stand out for years to come. It's a shame it wasn't topped later on in the movie. <br/><br/>I think that the problem with The Wolverine is that there was no great villain. The villains in the film, including one female mutant, are very one-dimensional and very, very uninteresting. From the trailers, you can see that we get the Silver Samurai, although he's nothing like he is in the comics. I hope that the next Wolverine outing comes with a dose of Omega Red, as I think a one on one Omega/Wolverine movie would be outstanding. If you look at the great comic book movies, they all have iconic, menacing, charismatic villains. The Dark Knight had Joker, the king of villains. Spider-Man 2 had Doc Oc. The Dark Knight Rises had Bane. This movie...had a few unmemorable villains. Shame, really. <br/><br/>There were a few good scenes here and Jackman did a great job as Logan/Wolverine, but as an overall product, I didn't think it was great. It was better than Origins, however. <br/><br/>PS: Be sure to stay after the credits, as (if you watched and remember the abomination known as X-Men: The Last Stand), there's quite a shocker that leads us into 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past. <br/><br/>Final Score: 6/10"

","This was better then the wretched ""Origins"" movie. But that is damning with feint praise.<br/><br/>On the positive side, it did move well. The pacing was good, the action well directed, and Hugh Jackman has the Logan character down pretty solidly. <br/><br/>On the other hand, this movie has a plot with more holes then a decent piece of swiss cheese. The motivations of most of the characters are murky and just seem off. Yashida-san senior's emotional motivations never seem clear. First, he is ready to commit seppuku, then he is over flowingly grateful to Logan for preventing that. THEN he is ready to steal from Logan powers Logan is unwilling to give. In an occidental character I could almost forgive such capriciousness and weakness but it was totally out of character from a highly traditional upper class Japanese man. Especially one with the strength of character to forge an empire.<br/><br/>Yashida-san Junior tells us his father bankrupted his company with his obsession with obtaining mutant powers... and yet is willing to murder his own daughter to obtain the inheritance of that company. <br/><br/>In one of the smallest but oddest inconsistencies, Logan refers to the silver samurai at the end as ""bob"", a name he gave Yashida senior during the war. Yet is somehow surprised when its head pops off and who is inside but Yashida senior? (Something which I would imagine surprised no one in the audience over the age of 8.)<br/><br/>The main mutant villain, the Viper, remains a mystery as to any of her motivations. About the only clues we see are a homicidal disdain for men and her self description as a ""mutant, nihilist and capitalist."" We can suppose her motivation was pay, but she seems awfully committed to the job for a hired hand employed by an icon of male economic power.<br/><br/>Mariko is basically the McGuffin. Everyones chasing after her for better or worse reasons. She herself is pretty much passive. But she too is strangely inconsistent. She tells Logan that she is marrying a man she despises because to not do so would ""dishonor her father""... and then within 10 minutes is jumping into bed with Logan. Now, I am not an expert on Japanese culture by any means, but this doesn't seem to me to do much in the ""honor"" department for her.<br/><br/>Yukio is Logan's reliable right hand from beginning to end. A fairly amazing transition of loyalties for someone who tells us her entire life is owed to the Yashida clan. Yes, Junior is a bastard and acts like it to her, but her primary loyalties are to Yashida senior who has almost no interaction with her in the film at all.<br/><br/>I could go on, but you get the idea. The characters in this movie are so shallowly drawn as to be indecipherable and motivated so poorly as to be totally uninteresting.<br/><br/>The sad fact, is I found the hint of what the NEXT movie will be about after the credits to be the most interesting part. But I always did like the Sentinels. (Note however that this creates a serious continuity error in the original XMen movie series, where we see them fighting a undersized Sentinel in a danger room exercise.)"
"CSHaviland","7","0","2","1 August 2013"," Worth seeing for a deep dive into Wolverine
","I appreciated this movie on a number of levels. For one, it tried to be different from its predecessors by not getting carried away by spectacle. I like epic super-hero movies but they don't all have to be that way. Sometimes they just need a little quiet time, to reflect on who they are and where they are going. For another, it maintained continuity with both X-Men Origins: Wolverine and X-Men III: The Last Stand, so that we don't feel like the filmmakers are re-inventing the character and thumbing what other directors have done with him.<br/><br/>This movie was introspective. Wolverine knows basically where he came from now. He joined Professor X but obviously didn't stick around the school. He suffers from chronic nightmares. And he suffers from a sense of purposelessness, which is what leads a lot of people to MDD (major depressive disorder) and suicide. But Wolverine doesn't age (at least not like most people), and heals so quickly that he's very hard to kill. What to do? The movie helps to reset him, to remind them that his fate is tied to a purpose. He just needs to stop moping around about his condition and own it.<br/><br/>Some of the action sequences are tremendous, especially the train. You don't have to knock down skyscrapers to have a breathtaking fight scene.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman takes his role very seriously. He always trains for the part, and his physique is really killer now. Unlike other actors like Christian Bale, who give up interest in playing the same super-hero, Jackman has no problem returning to the role over and over and building something new out of it. He'll be back again for X-Men: Days of Future Past. He is the only actor to appear in all of the X-Men movies playing Wolverine, with only a few seconds in X-Men First Class (which itself was a great film, but with continuity problems otherwise), and it helps to tie the franchise together. (Days of Future Past is rumored to try to fix some of the continuity errors, but we'll see.) I am to the point that I want to see a Hugh Jackman movie, no matter what it is. He's arrived as a great action star."
"sophieahmed7","7","0","4","31 July 2013"," Not a bad movie, not the best out of X-Men series
","All in all this was an alright movie. Hugh Jackman successfully portrayed Logan, and I also liked his bodyguard, Yukio. She could have been further developed, but her powers and her fighting skills were awesome.<br/><br/>I just didn't get the point in Viper, she was in around five scenes throughout the whole movie, and who was she working for? Was she doing this for herself, or was she working with Yashida?<br/><br/>Harada was also unimportant. I thought at the start when he was in the funeral scene that he would become some cool ally of Logan's, but he turned out to be this ninja bodyguard for Mariko working with Viper? The heck? He kept on changing his mind as well, it would have been alright if he was a ninja gone rogue, but he moved sides at least four times in the movie. <br/><br/>I thought Mariko was going to have some awesome mutant hidden powers? I mean, it does sound a bit weird, but this whole movie was just being dragged along with little depth to it, so why not? <br/><br/>Good things: the fight scenes, Yukio, Logan, Logan's hair (so hot), and the CGI. Yeah, the healing has got to have a mention, good graphics :)"
"saytosandeep","7","0","3","31 July 2013"," MY REVIEW: The Wolverine Once Again
","The Wolverine. Our hunk Hugh Jackman starring as Logan in its 6th outing still carries his charm as he carries his claws. This time he is in Japan saving his new Japanese lady love from ninja warriors. Set in dark set pieces, first half has little to offer to excite the audience except for the fight cum survival sequence on a bullet train. But second half quickly joins the missing pieces giving the movie its purpose and Hugh Jackman some scenes where he can be punch the bad guys with charming arrogance. The twist in the end is good but doesn't hit you hard. Overall, it won't disappoint Wolverine fans but it lacks the fun that we have whenever Logan fights the bad guys with his fellow mutants. To keep the excitement alive, there is one post end credits sequence hinting about the new threat for X-MEN."
"andy-barbieri","7","0","3","31 July 2013"," The Wolverine
","This second stand alone Wolverine film is a lot better than the first, in my opinion, and with Marvel Studios going full pelt into their universe, what with the recent 'Iron Man 3', 'Avengers, and the upcoming 'Thor 2: The Dark World' and recently announced 'Avengers 2', Fox have had to up their game a bit with their 'X-Men' movies to compete with the similar properties, and it does show, if a little rough around the edges.<br/><br/>The story is better too and tells of Logan's struggle with his immortality, as well as the love story between him and Mariko (Tao Okamoto). I did think that the villains in 'The Wolverine' were a bit meh, throwaway type villains if you will. Not really fleshed out enough, although that was maybe mainly due to the plot being about more of the suits behind corporations than say an evil force to subdue. That said, if you add in the few decent fight sequences; the funeral, on top of a speeding bullet train and of course the climactic fight at the end, plus the deep Japanese culture and lush scenery throughout, it's a decent enough effort into the X-Men mythos. Entertaining, but maybe not quite on par with the Marvel/Disney efforts, but almost there.<br/><br/>And a word of warning, you've just GOT to stay after the end credits, as it seems to set up things to come. It's worth it, believe me!"
"drtagnjr","7","0","2","29 July 2013"," Good, summer-action flick with character introspection, and a few gaping holes
","The Wolverine does not attempt to be too many things at once, but what you expect from it, or want, will dictate how distracting the plot holes are which will in the end determine your enjoyment level. Unless you are seeking fault, or seeking Oscar worthy attributes, all others should find redemption and enjoyment in the movie.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman once again reprises the title character and he conveys the angst, apathy, and attitude admirably at various points throughout the film. He suffers only slightly at how the character is written to be portrayed, to which I do not hold him accountable.<br/><br/>Mariko, Yukio and even Harada are played well with Yukio earning the gold both acting-wise, and the most depth to the character. Harada seems to suffer with the direction of his character, but this can be attributed to a character flaw rather than storyline error if one wants. Mariko plays off the strength, individuality, and tempered vulnerability adeptly, but is surprisingly written fairly flat, impeding one aspect of the storyline.<br/><br/>The villains are sadly underdeveloped making it hard to a)understand motivations, b)care about the endgame. It doesn't help that both of those two things are the largest storyline plot holes both in design and execution.<br/><br/>In the end, buying into Logan's self-evaluation, growth, and emotions is done best by watching the main character in the moments between action, and not best served with the in your face 'dream' sequences. The action and the impact the storyline has on Wolverine physically is inconsistent, but the emotional depth within him rather than playing off others is the strength of the story."
"MahaFilmGuru","7","0","2","29 July 2013"," Some Good Action, Some Good Drama, Not Enough Details to Care
","I feel like somewhere there exists a really good script for this movie. Perhaps in the comics? I'm not a comic fan, in fact I've never read any comics at all. But I still love films based on comics.<br/><br/>Only two parts of the movie were good in my opinion. First is Hugh ""Caveman Hugh"" , or Logan have a little marking territory squabble with a bear. Hiliarous! Come 30 minute later he is slashing it up with some bad guys on a 300 mph bullet train. Awesome concept, I think a first in cinema.<br/><br/>Everything else was either bland or unexplained. For example the last action scene was extremely bland. It was not thrilling or suspenseful at all, because hey ""We've seen the previews"" , we know the bad guys won't beat him because he has to fight the super metal soldier later.<br/><br/>The unexplained stuff, is the the red haired girls relationship with the villain girl. It seemed like the director showed her knowing more with her looks in the beginning. But in the end they just make her to be innocent. Also what the story between the Logan and Mariko, the story between Mariko and her ex-by archery guy, the really messed up family dynamic. The relationship between the father and the archery guy... everything seems like it is linked somehow, but nothing was really explained well. A lot of possible drama in there with an interesting story, however they just gave us glimpses of it."
"adrongardner","7","0","3","28 July 2013"," If it bleeds, we can kill it
","This is better than the last go around, but not without a truck load of missed opportunities to do something much better than this. <br/><br/>The Wolverine took me to a nice return trip to Japan without the bad airline food and turbulence sitting in coach for 14 hours, but I wished they would have had more for me to do when I got there. Rila Fukushima was a master stroke in casting but damn near wasted with lots of useless dialog and Tao Okamoto doesn't really have much to do. But along with Pacific Rim's Rinko Kikuchi, I'm glad these great actresses from Nihon are getting the play they deserve. It would be nice if they had more to do than pull upright chop sticks from the soba. Like the actors, rich Japanese references were all tossed as background noise and not put to much use in what is essentially a chase movie. <br/><br/>Even with the Jean Grey angle, there was a better story in here someplace. Essentially, the filmmakers hinted at it but never pursued better ideas in any seriousness. The themes in The Wolverine lead to many interesting questions which would have made a more powerful movie. ""How does one kill one who cannot die?"" or ""Is immortality actually another form of death?"" <br/><br/>It would have been nice to see a Marvel movie actually try and develop a character for once instead of two more hours of Hulk-Smash scenes. Oh yeah and the Viper villain was just trash. She fell out of Power Rangers or something. Totally out of tone with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Yes, it could have all been better. But I'll say this, it was a heck of a lot better than the last go around. I'll take that kind of progress over none at all."
"meetanknig","8","0","3","28 July 2013"," Not up to the mark
","A good action packed movie but not enough as to be expected from ""Wolverine 2"". However, the metro action scenes were superbly choreographed with new approach due to which the speed can totally felt in 3D. The Hero's age factor is enlightened throughout the movie in which at the beginning, he saves an anonymous Japanese soldier at the time period of IInd World War, who later became a foe in order to acquire Wolverine's regenerative ability & forever vitality. The movie consists of many daydreaming & hallucinations of Jean as being killed in X-Men The Last Stand, advising Logan again & again negatively. For the first time , Logan has been pushed to live & die as typical humans but somehow manages to acquire his original powerful self. Overall, the movie has good action scenes, choreography & acting but an interesting story."
"dandulieu","7","0","4","27 July 2013"," Okay but not groundbreaking
","This film has a mixture of good/cool but there were some boring dips. Several scenes appeared very costly (like the train scene) and this was actually done well, a lot of cool angles and shots happen. I thought the train scene was one of the most memorable parts of the movie and the trailer. I felt as though there could have been more of an exciting plot and maybe even more Wolverine action going on - it was almost like the interesting parts of the film were scattered and I felt as though some scenes could have been removed to make way for a much better flow of what was working.<br/><br/>The ending was well worth watching after the credits. This evidently leads on from the X-Men Trilogy - and very unexpected. After seeing this scene you can't help but feel like it is a money/marketing strategy more than, therefore the film has no final closure as such and typically intrigues the viewer to seeing the sequels.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, but not the best release this year. The action scenes were cool but apart from the ending it was a little predictable."
"dbrown1793","7","0","4","26 July 2013"," A Warning for Parents
","As fun as this movie is, don't be misled by its PG-13 rating. The ""F-Bomb"" is dropped quite often in this film along with other words of the obscene variety. If you can duct tape your children's ears, they will love the visuals which fortunately are fairly bloodless. Otherwise, this is a comic book come to life with Hugh Jackman channeling Clint Eastwood and following the standard Marvel script of a mighty industrialist/genius either using his powers for Good or surrendering to the Dark Side. The ending, in which we are treated to some sort of Samurai-Voltran almost ruined the movie but not quite. Check your brain at the door, ogle at Jackman's ripped physique and enjoy the ride."
"tomassparups","6","0","4","26 July 2013"," Over the top, but fun. 6.5/10
","After the outright terrible ""X Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""Marvel"" has come out with another ""Wolverine"" movie in hopes of redeeming themselves after their colossal failure. When it comes to ""Marvel"" character's, ""Wolverine"" must be my favorite of them all. I was a big fan of the ""X-Men"" movies (except for ""The Last Stand""), despite their many plot holes and missteps, I remained a fan. The character of ""Wolverine"" has always to me been the most fascinating of the ""X-Men"" team. With his backstory being so vast, there seemed to be an unlimited amount of potential for his character. This is a character that always had a more mature feel for him, even when placed in campy stories. In ""The Wolverine"", Hugh Jackman returns to play the title role of the film for the sixth time. Following the events of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", Logan, also known as ""The Wolverine"" has gone back to Canada to hide in a cave in the mountains surrounding a small, town. Once a proud member of the ""X-Men"" Logan has become a reclusive nobody, growing a large beard and regressing to the state of a broken man. After getting into a bar fight, Logan is approached by a mysterious woman named Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who offers him to go to Japan to visit a friend from his past. This friend is none other than Japan's wealthiest man Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), who's life Logan saved during the second world war. Yashida is dying of an unknown disease and has invested billions of dollars to keep him alive, but his time is running out. He gives Logan a proposition, for Logan to transmit his healing powers to Yashida so that he can live a normal life and eventually die. Or as he puts it ""liberating"" him from his eternal pain.<br/><br/>The action and fight sequences are pretty impressive, but at times they feel so over the top that it is hard to take them seriously. I like the fact that this is a movie that was not scared to stray into more mature territory despite being rated PG-13. I'm not a fan of extreme violence, which granted there is none of in this movie, but it was interesting to see a fair amount of blood in this seeing as ""Marvel"" movies are usually on the more campy side of the spectrum. The problem with this film is that there are a fair amount of little plot holes and incoherences that took me out of the movie at times. The visual effects and cinematography satisfy, though this is definitely not one of the main focus points in the movie. The performances are nothing special, Hugh Jackman does what he did before, the brooding and dangerous character, but in the case of this movie, he did bring a more dramatic and intimate side to the character of Wolverine that we haven't seen that much before. All the performances were fine, except for Svetlana Khodchenkova's performance which was terrible. Her character felt so fake an exaggerated that it was downright painful to watch.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something fun and enjoyable, I would definitely recommend it, but as anything else than a fun movie, it does not really hold up. The action is over the top, despite having some well made fight sequences and the plot is lacking substance, although I am pleased to say that this movie went into mature territory and gave the character of ""Wolverine"" some much needed humane aspects."
"SerotoninMCMXCI","6","0","4","26 July 2013"," Solid
","For me the word to describe this film would probably be, solid. I feel it was definitely entertaining enough and delivered adequately in the action department, I particularly enjoyed to of the earlier action sequences(when Logan first arrives in Japan). The story was solid, and it was interesting to see this character in foreign territory. Also the idea as Wolverine as a kind of samurai is also interesting, although the lack of any real villain was a negative for me. I think any comic book film needs a strong villain. <br/><br/>Overall, this film was good solid entertainment, without being overtly impressive or kicking on into a fourth or fifth gear. The performances are all good, and I left the cinema satisfied, although I still think the definitive ""Wolverine"" film is yet to be made."
"The_moan_of_all_moans","7","0","4","26 July 2013"," Wish i could grow mutton chops :(
","X-Men movies have always been enjoyable. Even the fairly average X-Men: The Last Stand had some entertaining qualities. The Wolverine is no different in that aspect. It had me gripped through most of it. But it was missing something. It was missing a great Villain.<br/><br/>Apart from all the bad guys who are destined to get wiped out in a film like this, there where two main villains and neither where very interesting; they weren't a Magneto. That of course is a lot to live up to in the X-Men films, but there have been great villains in the previous films; Sabretooth (X-Men origins), Mystique, Stryker (X2), even Toad.... well maybe not Toad.<br/><br/>Viper and Tashida just didn't interest me and their lack of character hurt the films potential in my opinion. Despite that it is still a great film and the action scenes are excellent; as i said before i was zoned in for quite some time. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good old action film.<br/><br/>And one other thing. When i think Wolverine, i think of a mutant who is a machine. Someone who will claw your face without so much of a twitch. I wasn't too keen on the few soppy scenes. Get your act together Logan."
