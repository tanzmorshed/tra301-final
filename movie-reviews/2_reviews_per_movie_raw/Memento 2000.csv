","Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive."

","If you're looking for something intense, suspenseful, and different than your usual effects-packed thriller, this is the best movie you will see all year. You will be talking about Memento at work, at the grocery store (to total strangers!), and you will find yourself joining conversations when you hear the word ""Memento."" That's why this little film that received almost no marketing stayed in theaters for months and was in the top 10 money makers for several weeks.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a murder -- a revenge killing, in fact. But was the right person killed?<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man with no short-term memory. He hasn't been able to form new memories since the night his wife was murdered. Now he's on a hunt to find the murderer but with no way of remembering names, dates, places, facts and faces. Instead he tattoos himself with mementos of his search. When someone knows his name, he checks Polaroids to see if he knows them. Does he like this person? Does he trust this person? Is this the killer? He doesn't know unless he's scribbled a note.<br/><br/>Don't worry about trying to empathize with Leonard because Writer/Director Christopher Nolan puts you right in Leonard's shoes. You live the story in reverse order so that you never know more than Leonard does. In one scene you see Leonard getting information from a person who knows him -- maybe a good person; maybe bad. In the next scene you see a previous meeting between the two which sheds more light on their relationship. Later still you see how they met. But is that all of the story? You've yet to find out... and you won't know everything until the last scene. By living it backwards, you, like Leonard, have no knowledge of what came before.<br/><br/>It's brilliant story telling. But you might get frustrated because you don't know what's going on. That's normal. In fact, that's the whole idea. Just sit back, try to relax (though that's difficult in this movie), and find out just how twisted and complex Leonard's world is.<br/><br/>This film will leave its own memento on your mind, and you'll have a hard time forgetting how much you enjoyed it."
"quixoboy","Null","422","480","1 September 2003"," Addictive and fun to figure out
","Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is truly a rare and exceptional achievement in modern filmmaking in that it manages to be new, fresh, hip, and exciting without ever tiring its audience out - unless you're walking into this film without the desire to participate and actively analyze the mysterious details.<br/><br/>If that's the case, then this is DEFINITELY not a movie you should see. If, on the other hand, you are open-minded, creative, and alert, you'll definitely appreciate and get a kick out of this one. ""Memento"" is an old-fashioned ""film noir""-type mystery thriller with an intriguing, ingenious twist: outfitting the entire film with a style that mirrors the protagonist's own mental condition while giving the poor viewer(s) his own perspective as well. It is masterfully filmed and edited in such a way that it is chronologically presented backwards (with two initially separate, parallel storylines - the main one, shot in colour, is the chronologically-backwards story with scenes that intercut with those of the other story, which is filmed more like a documentary, shot in black & white, and mostly takes place inside a motel room with the main character narrating, talking about the effects of his condition, etc.) While the average viewer may already be put off by such a complicated, confusing format, it is a very original premise that is well worth the struggle to figure out.<br/><br/>Acting is solid across the board, as is the writing, directing, etc., but special kudos must be extended to the very talented editor Dody Dorn, who successfully managed to put all of these fragments together and help them flow in a smooth, healthy manner that is not easy to pull off.<br/><br/>One of the most ""memorable"" (sorry, couldn't help slipping in the bad joke) films you're likely to ever see, ""Memento"" is an instant classic due to its groundbreaking narrative style and impressive dramatic undertones. For those jaded moviegoers who seek something to keep them awake, interested, and constantly thinking, there couldn't be a better choice than this film."
"wkbeason","10","113","128","9 July 2002"," Innovative narrative structure makes for a powerful viewing experience
","FACT ONE: ""Just because there are things I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless.""<br/><br/>FACT TWO: ""Your notes could be unreliable.""<br/><br/>FACT THREE: ""Memories can be distorted.""<br/><br/>FACT FOUR: ""But, even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it.  You won't even know it's happened.""<br/><br/>FACT FIVE: ""I want time to pass, but it won't. How can I heal if I can't feel time?""<br/><br/>FACT SIX: ""We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.""<br/><br/>When life becomes incomprehensible human beings tend to simplify things, revise memories, select facts that may or may not be representative of ""the truth.""  We strive to make events as intelligible as possible but that act often has unintended consequences.  Now, if you can capture this existential human reality on film in such a way as to allow the viewer to experience this struggle for understanding, for the placement of private aspirations into the context of the moment even as the primary character makes this same struggle, then you have connected our hearts and minds seamlessly with the film's lifeworld.  That is a rarity indeed.<br/><br/>Such is Memento, a brilliantly conceived and executed work of art that has its audience literally at their wits end (just like the film's main character) trying to understand it all.  The great debate of whether Teddy's version of the truth at the end is really ""the truth"" is symptomatic of director Christopher Nolan's purposeful craftsmanship.  The very fact that we are as uncertain throughout most of the film as to the context of Leonard Shelby's actions as Leonard himself signifies that Nolan has succeeded in not just telling us Leonard's story put allowing us to know what it is like to *be* Leonard.  This allows the film to work at a much deeper, almost subconscious, level scarcely achieved on film.<br/><br/>Guy Pierce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano all deliver terrific performances with some of the most original material I've seen in years. This film grabs your brain and won't let go.  It twists and turns and  just when you think you've got things figured out  Nolan whips the rug out from under your feet.  You are left totally involved and struggling with creating some sense of closure out of the infinite loop of the film's structure.<br/><br/>You can debate endlessly whether Teddy's final summary of events is the truth.  You can argue both sides of whether Leonard killed his wife or invented Sammy Jankis out of thin air.  In the end these are open questions. In the end there are no definitive answers.  In fact, in the end ANY answer is plausible, just choose the one that sits best in your mind.  Make that the truth.  Because THAT is what this film is all about.  It's about a man who can remember who he is but not what he has done and, to that extend, it is the prefect postmodern critique.  We are often forced to act without sufficient information.  The accelerating rush of our lives sends us headlong into our present without full consideration of where we've been. And on that level Memento provides a bold, compelling narrative that connects Leonard with every person.  It is the mirror image of our divided selves.<br/><br/>No matter how much his audience might disagree with the film's conclusion, Nolan understands that - in the end - truth doesn't matter.  It is what we choose to do with what we think is the truth that's important.  And that can mean anything at all."
"lasher42","10","354","429","24 May 2001"," can't believe how much I'm still thinking the day after
","So the ""innovative"" concept of filming out of sequence has been cliche for at least a few years now, but here's a film that makes it work far better than its been shown in a while.<br/><br/>Having read the reviews and talked to others who saw it, I thought that I'd go into the movie figuring everything out right away and declaring the concept unworkable.  I couldn't be further from the truth.  This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries.  Portrayed (for all intents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that our lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than usual) does.  Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife.  Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.<br/><br/>Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.<br/><br/>Overall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I'm still not sure.  This film noir concept shouldn't work, but it does so wonderfully."
"Old Joe","10","135","162","6 February 2003"," Some memories are best forgotten. You have to appreciate how original a movie Memento' really is!
","Losing your memory would have to go close to one of the worst experience anyone could ever suffer from. In the movie Memento', we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of Pulp Fiction', Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world. <br/><br/>Leonard Shelby wears expensive, tailored suits, drives a late model Jaguar sedan, but lives in cheap, anonymous motels, paying his way with thick wads of cash. Although he looks like a successful businessman, his only work is the pursuit of vengeance: tracking and punishing the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that Leonard suffers from a rare, untreatable form of amnesia'. Although he can recall details of life before his accident' Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he is, where he is going, or why.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has made one great (but confusing) movie. His style in directing and editing Memento' is quite unique, as no movie has ever been made quite like it before. The story being told in a backward kind of motion makes the audience have to think hard about what they are watching. It also makes the audience feel for a guy like Leonard, whose condition only gets worse and worse as the movie goes on. I am almost 100% sure that Nolan and his brother Jonathan, made up this story in the realisation that it was meant to be confusing. What is also cleverly done by Nolan is the use of black and white and then colour shots. In my opinion, the variations in these shots are used so it confuses the audience even more. <br/><br/>
Guy Pearce's role in Memento' shows me why he is so successful in Hollywood today. Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on the hunt for his wife's killer. The only problem is that Shelby is suffering from anterior-grade amnesia', a disease that cannot be treated. With Lenny', I feel the audience suffers partly the same condition as he does, and partly does not, as we can remember what has happened in the present. <br/><br/>Memento's other main stars include corrupt cop Teddy' (Joe Pantoliano). A friend said of Pantoliano's performance in Memento, he was perfect for the role of Teddy', as he comes across as the mysterious bad guy'. I could not agree more. There is also the character of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is a lot like Teddy in her own way. What is similar about these characters is the way they use Leonard's condition to advantage their own situations.<br/><br/>
Other characters include Sammy Jenkis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is a victim we learn about from an old case when Leonard Shelby was an insurance investigator. There is Leonard's wife, Catherine (C.S.I.'s Jorja Fox) who is another fascinating character. Although we do not hear her say much, she is a vital part of this most confusing story. Add in the funny role of Burt (Mark Boone Jnr.), the motel clerk, who openly admits to Lenny that he is ripping him off, by giving him two rooms, but that he will not remember it happening anyway.<br/><br/>Yet in no way do any of the characters in Memento' realise they are in a time reversed movie. I am sure that many of the performers would have had to read their scripts many times to understand what was happening from a cinematic point of view. But from an acting prospective, this would have been an easy experience to be part of. Memento also has some interesting devices to tell the story. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. Without them, our hero would not be able to remember anything. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, memory is the most vital element in this movie, because without it, people are confused, isolated and abused, which is what happens to our hero', Leonard.  As Lenny mentions early on in the film, ""Memory's unreliable ... Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the colour of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.""  But it has to be ironic that Leonard is the one who narrates Memento', when his recollections and memories of events are inaccurate and jaded. There are also some powerful scenes in Memento'. The one which sticks in my mind the most' has to be where Natalie abuses Leonard, calling his dead wife a whore', snorting smartly that you won't be even able to remember what I have said'.  <br/><br/>So, if you watch this movie and it confuses you the first or even the second time, I can assure you that is how you are meant to feel, confused. If you hated watching Memento' the way Christopher Nolan intended, then I can only recommend that you get a hold of the DVD and watch it in chronological order, as it will really help you. Memento also shows how bad mental disease' patients can be abused by healthy people and what lengths sick patients will go to try and keep sane'. Also, if a movie makes you think, then in some way it has been successful in doing something that many movies do not do  making you think. Those sorts of cinematic experiences are the ones that we need to cherish for life, as they are few and far between. Memento is one such experience. <br/><br/>CMRS gives Memento': 5 (Brilliant Movie)"
"adamp-6","10","118","142","31 January 2002"," watch it early so you can see something else afterward.
","I saw ""Memento"" in the early afternoon, a fact for which I am thankful. Why?  Because it then proceeded to dominate the majority of my thoughts for the rest of the day.  That night I lay in bed, tossing and turning, my mind trying to wrap itself around the story, and I absolutely could not GO TO SLEEP!  <br/><br/>I finally just gave up on sleep, got up around midnight, and watched ""Election"" to cleanse my palate.  Then I went back to bed and starting contemplating ""Memento"" AGAIN.  Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, I went to sleep.<br/><br/>This is a movie that gets in your head and will not get out until you figure it all out.  And that can only be done with extensive internet research. Reading ""Memento Mori"", the short story upon which the movie is ""based"" helped, too.<br/><br/>""Memento"" is nothing short of a phenomenon.  And a brilliant one at that."
"Heretic Monkey","Null","303","382","7 May 2001"," overused plot + often abused style = best movie of the year
","A man with no short term memory tries to solve a murder.  The scenes in the movie are played in reverse.  Sounds like yet another run of the mill comedy but in reality is one of the best suspense/dramas I've seen in years.<br/><br/>While some may claim showing the scenes in reverse is just an annoying trick to make a simple plot confusing and add a plethora of twists, I wholeheartedly disagree.  Any good story teller knows it's not what you say, but how you say it.<br/><br/>By playing the scenes in reverse you experience the confusion Lenny undergoes throughout the film.  Showing some of the scenes in chronological order (BTW, the use of B&W instead of color to make the time distinction was ingenious) creates suspense which builds as the two timelines converge.  The somewhat rushed pace (compared to a written format) doesn't give you enough time to adequately analyze the events during the movie.  This has two advantages: firstly you're going to talk about it after you leave the theater adding to experience immensely,   and secondly  you don't have time to think about what has happened (will happen) so you're experience better follows that of Lenny.<br/><br/>While many might find the movie rather confusing, it flows wonderfully for anyone familiar with writing styles that constantly jump around a timeline (e.g. Catch 22)."
"ruffinelli_ro","9","38","44","4 April 2009"," A trip into the mind
","If the director of this independent film tried to make us feel really confused, like the main character, he did it wonderfully. There are only a few movies like this one, the kind of movies that makes you pay attention to every minute of it. Obviously that doesn't work all the time, but this case is the exception. Really well directed with a wonderful photography and excellent cast. The main actors' performances are great. We really root for the guy as we hate the ones who try to take advantage of him.<br/><br/>Original films like this one always stand out. Perhaps it didn't caught much attention at first but now it is in an important position at the IMDb top 250 and that means that most the people recognize great movies when they see them.<br/><br/>As I said before, this movie is a little confusing because it runs backwards while the black and white scenes run in chronological order. But that wasn't a cheap trick to make the movie more ""intelectual"", it was its strength. A rare film that shouldn't be missed."
"kylemyle728","10","26","30","1 November 2010"," Overview and analysis behind the shocking plot.
","During the movie ""Memento,"" the audience is left guessing throughout the whole movie until the very end. It has a unique style of presenting the plot in which the movie begins with a scene and then it plays backwards from there. While the movie jumps backwards scene by scene, there is also a transition played in black and white that is continuously playing forwards until a certain point. It is not until the very end of the movie where the scenes played in color meet with the ones played in black and white. This is where the climax of the movie occurs and all the revelations of each characters role are revealed. It is a must see and you will not regret it.<br/><br/>In the end of the movie we find out that the main character Lenny, who suffers from short term memory loss, has been tricked by his so called friend Teddy, into killing a drug dealer. Throughout the whole movie Lenny is on a quest to kill the murderer of his wife, who is in fact Lenny himself. Lenny gets the identity of himself and a man named Sammy Jenkis confused and we find out that Lenny is in fact Sammy. It leads us to believe that Lenny has used his brain condition to illicit forgetting what really happened to his wife to clear himself of shame and anger. This caused him to create Sammy Jenkis and allows him to believe that the ones who assaulted his wife and gave him the brain condition were the ones who supposedly killed his wife. We find out that Teddy, who is a local cop, has already helped Lenny kill the man who assaulted his wife. Yet Lenny forgot all about it and Teddy kept the proof and then used Lenny for his own benefit to kill a drug dealer for money. Once Lenny figures this out in the end of the movie he decides to burn all the evidence and leaves himself a clue that indicates Teddy is in fact the one who killed his wife. Lenny then leaves the scene reminding himself that he is still alive and then as fast as it was all revealed it is then forgotten. This leads us back into the rest of the movie in which we had already seen in reverse order.<br/><br/>When the movie is over the audience is left shocked and slightly confused about how to view Lenny. He acts as if he is an innocent man who has now become a conscious free murderer. He forgets everything he doesn't write down but he is the one choosing to leave out the facts that he finds out on multiple occasions that he is in fact a murderer for pleasure. It started as pay back but for someone who forgets the feeling so easily and has no direction to his life, why not make it a hobby. It's odd to think about that he is spending all his effort searching for his wife's killer when in reality it is Lenny he is looking for. He takes the lives of others to free him of guilt which in the end makes him more of a villain than the movies hero."
"jim-cook","10","194","258","2 July 2001"," The real thing!
","If you hate reality-based film-making this is awful. If you hate Film Noir, this is ugly. But for me, Nolan has convinced me he is one of the most important directors out there. I was even thinking, ""It must be easy to edit a movie so that it's all backwards."" But it's not, it's not any easier - and he leaves you straining and watching from scene to scene, searching for the truth. Even the final revelation will affect each viewer and leaves them searching for their own ""ultimate truth"" according to their own experience.<br/><br/>Most people comment about manipulation in connection with this movie, but after watching the last scene, I'm convinced that manipulation is not the main theme at all. I don't want to spoil it for you, but the basis of unfolding backwards in time is that you are enlisted to scrutinize the film trying to discover some set of motivations behind each character's actions later in time that makes sense. If you think you would enjoy this sort of puzzle, I think you will enjoy this excellently crafted film."
"Pseudo-geordie boy","Null","263","355","25 January 2001"," Confusion, uncertainty, and paranoia as an art form: possibly.
","If I told you the entire plot of this film it really wouldn't matter as it is an exquisite paean to the subjectivity of memory and therefore is in itself ambiguous; the truth' of it is up to you. You come out of the cinema questioning yourself, your memories, your truths. Nothing in this film is as it seems, and yet paradoxically everything is as it seems. We see everything through Guy Pearce's characters' (Lenny) eyes, unfortunately he has no short-term memory so cannot form new memories. He would have already forgotten the first sentence of this review. He lives in snapshots of life; his only form of memory is his Polaroid camera, just like in the excellent German film Wintersleepers; also (partly) about a short-term memory disorder.<br/><br/>In this film Lenny takes snapshots to remember who people are, where he now lives, his car, everything. As you can imagine this is perfect for paranoia, suspicion, uncertainty, confusion, and betrayal. And that's exactly what you get in extreme doses. The difference between this film and Wintersleepers however is that Memento is entirely from Lenny's perspective. This therefore creates an imaginative, creatively unsurpassable film. The film begins where it should end, so far so trite, but here's the beauty, we, like Guy Pearce, learn in fragments what's going on. It is therefore perfect for those who love to second guess what's going to happen, who did what, who's doing what and why. The beauty of this film though is that my interpretation could be so different from yours, and neither of us could be sure whose interpretation is the right one; if there is a right one at all. Nothing is certain, nothing is clear. Another beauty of this film is the way it is filmed and edited. Pieces are shown a number of times with no real linear link between them, just like it would be if we ourselves had a memory disorder, and then they are cut up and edited next to things that happen either before or after it. It's just like holding ten different and linearly distinct Polaroids in your hand and having a short-term memory disorder. Excellent.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure if watching it again will make things any less ambiguous, but then who cares? The ambiguity is what makes this a great film, if it wasn't so cut up, or from Lenny's perspective it would be both very short and trite; and lacking in tension, suspense and interest. But as it stands it has all three, isn't trite and says so much about humanity. Oh, and the plot? It really doesn't matter, all you need to know is that everything about this film is indicative of the subjectivity of memory, of our experiences and interpretations of all that happens to us. Nothing will seem as black and white as it did beforehand. It will make you question every memory you have, almost as much as possessing a psychology degree, as I do! So, go and see it: be confused, acknowledge the frailty of all you know to be true, and then imagine the freedom of actually being Lenny, and then the horror of having nothing, nothing but the reliance of a pen and a Polaroid camera to know who you are."

","Yes, it's true.  The entire movie is based on a gimmick.  However, I honestly feel that this does not cheapen the picture in the slightest bit. I loved every scene; discovering information as our lead character discovered it. It demands a second and third viewing, as there are many subtleties and quick flashes that may not be picked up on the first time around.  Its one of the most original films ever made, and for people who scoff at the concept of not having a short-term memory, it actually is a real condition. Watch this movie. And, please pay attention. The performances are wonderful, and its structured magnificently."

","MEMENTO / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	How is this for a scenario? A man breaks into your house in the middle of the night. He kills your wife and leaves you with brain injuries. Furious, you pledge your life to track down and kill whoever is responsible. There is just one problem: after the head injury, you are no longer capable of creating new memories; everything before the accident is crystal clear, but now you cannot remember anything past several minutes.<br/><br/>	Now chew on this: what happens to guilt if you cannot remember what you did? How can a person have emotions if he does not know where they came from? How can we learn from our experiences if we cannot remember them. What is the purpose of revenge if someone cannot recollect or prosper from it?<br/><br/>
	""Memento"" wins this year's prize for inducing the most audience participation. Not only is the film thought-provoking and unusually absorbing, but it also places us in the main character's shoes. How can we be in the same mental status with the main character when he cannot remember anything? Writer/director Christopher Nolan has that answer: he tells the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. However, each individual scene plays running forward, often overlapping, providing us with clear, constructive transitions. The main character, Leonard, is confused in prospects of time and experience, and so are we.<br/><br/>	Other characters include Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, from ""The Matrix""), who also lost someone close and can help Leonard, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano, also from ""The Matrix""), whose identity often shifts mysteriously. Then there is the series of flashbacks of Leonard's experiences while working as an insurance agent. The situation involves an individual named Sammy, who has a memory disorder similar to Leonard's. His diabetic spouse is not sure whether her husband is faking his condition or not. To prove it to herself she arranges a test I dare not reveal. Leonard is more intricately involved in this story than he even believes.  <br/><br/>	""Memento"" is smart and imaginative. It doesn't pass up little details of the characters. Leonard is constantly jotting himself notes and taking Polaroid pictures so his life can make some sense. He even gets permanent tattoos all over his body so he does not lose or forget some of the most important information. <br/><br/>In a movie like this, it would be almost impossible to make without leaving some information out; even some of the film's actors were confused and requested a script told in sequence order. But these filmmakers have constructed a movie with a plot hole big enough to drive a semi through: If Leonard cannot remember anything after the accident, then how can he remember that he has a memory condition? There are no tattoos or notes to remind him, and whenever he meets someone he explains his condition thoroughly. This is necessary information he reveals, but there are better ways to do so. We could be there when his doctor explains the condition to him, or see his friends talking about it. The sky is the limit in a movie like this. It was not essential to leave such a massive, obvious hole in the plot. <br/><br/>""Memento"" is still a unique mystery thriller. It is a tantalizing experience we do not often come across at the movies. For audiences who like to sit back and relax, this film is a waste of time. It requires us to follow along, participate, fit puzzle pieces together-""Memento"" doesn't provide any easy or obvious answers. All but the most intelligent and thoughtful kids will not be able to follow this film; it is intended for adult audiences. ""Memento"" is one of the year's most challenging movies, not to be missed if you are looking for something clever and original."

Untold credit to editor, Dody Dorn, for shuffling the deck as confusingly as possible, yet weaving the tale as tightly as a sanitarium wicker basket.<br/><br/>6) But every few minutes, the movie twists back on itself, each flashback a segment of Leonard's life that happened just before the segment we have just seen  and with each flashback, we realize just how wrong Leonard is about who his friends are, his past life, clues to the killer, his quest *in toto.* By about the fourth paragraph we realize: this piece is running backwards.<br/><br/>5) From Jonathan Nolan's short story, *Memento Mori*, we meet Leonard mid-investigation, slumming it in a cockroach motel, having lost his job as insurance consultant, looking disheveled (as Guy Pierce can do so natchelly), and optimistically on the trail of the murderer; hanging with gregarious Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), and involved with hot bod, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), both of whom seem to be aiding Leonard catch his killer.<br/><br/>4) Leonard's last ""new memory"" was the murder of his wife. During the scuffle with his wife's killer, a blow to the head caused his memory faculty to shut down. Whether this is truly biologically possible (if you cannot make new memories, how do you even shop for food and water or pay the rent?), for the movie's purposes, it means Leonard must piece together clues to his wife's killer through copious notes, tattoos on his own body and Polaroids. But the truth will forever elude him and the clues that lead to the killer are mere wraiths, the products of his own ""selective"" reasoning.<br/><br/>3) The harder you strive for something, the harder it is to grasp. But what you care least about - or that you were never striving for  falls into your lap. Some call this the path of least resistance, but it's actually called The Reverse Genius Principle. And Leonard - all ephemeral ideas and misplaced action  is a Reverse Genius in full throttle.<br/><br/>2) Guy Pearce is the memory-challenged Leonard, who is trying so hard to move forward  to find his wife's killer, but unable to create ""new memories"" to retain info - that he ends up moving backward. Thusly, writer-director Christopher Nolan has crafted a film where the clues to a murder fall neatly OUT of place. Backwards.<br/><br/>1) *Memento* opens with a killing. We don't know why. We don't know who."
"EThompsonUMD","9","16","21","2 October 2001"," Original and intriguing film noir revision.
","Revising such film noir conventions as a story told through the unreliable point of view and voice-over narration of a morally flawed investigator-protagonist, the pervasive infusion of a dark past into the narrative present, and the use of a femme fatale as an embodiment of evil allure, Memento is perhaps the most original and intriguing revision of the genre since Welles' Touch of Evil.<br/><br/>As almost every commentator has noted, the most startling (or 'gimmicky') feature of Memento - and one with obvious roots in the film noir tradition - is its inverted/contorted plot structure. The film loops backwards episodically to present a series of revelations about the main character, Lenny (Guy Pearce), about the motives of his antagonists 'Teddy' (Joe Pantolino) and 'Natalie' (Carrie Ann Moss), and about the nature of Lenny's memory-loss condition. His condition 'isn't amnesia' (or so Lenny tells everyone he meets) but rather such severe short term memory loss that he is unable to assimilate and retain experience - in other words, to make new memories. Consequently, Lenny's identity, or more precisely his self-knowledge, is arrested at the moment he received a blow to his head while trying to stop intruders from raping his wife.<br/><br/>Everything that has happened thereafter has no subjective reality for Lenny, only whatever 'objective' reality he can forge using instant photos, notes to himself, and - for the really important stuff - tattoos. But matters are even more complex and paradoxical than this setup might lead one to expect. Gradually, the viewer learns that even the clear memories that Lenny claims to have from before the assault are, like dreams, colored by protective distortions and selectivity. Moreover the so-called facts he has assembled in his investigation and that he defensively claims are more reliable than memory turn out to be irretrievably entangled in subjective motives: his own, Teddy's, and Natalie's. Thus the viewer's initial sympathy for Lenny as a justifiable victim/avenger transforms to horror as Lenny's true current identity becomes clear.<br/><br/>Importantly, Memento's regressive plot structure is punctuated and counter-pointed by a series of noirish black and white flashbacks in which Lenny relates to an anonymous phone caller the story of Sammy Jankis, another sufferer of short term memory loss who, ironically, was Lenny's big case in his pre-trauma life as an insurance investigator. Unlike the main narrative, the Sammy sequences are told in chronological order, strategically intersecting and organizing the narrative as it wends its way backwards to the moment when Lenny decides to set in motion the data trail that will lead to the murder we see him commit in the film's opening sequence. In addition, Lenny's reconstruction of the Sammy sequences is itself dreamlike and unreliable since he attributes to Sammy characteristics that (if we can believe Teddy, an utterly corrupt cop) are Lenny's own.<br/><br/>In addition to providing plot exposition and a recurring visual/narrative reference point, the Sammy sequences also bring into clear thematic focus the existential implications of memory loss. Like Sammy's, Lenny's 'condition' is a reduction to the most minimal and absurd level of the human mental processes for constructing meaning (in life, in film) out of fragmentary phenomena and evanescent recollections. In an age of Alzheimer's, deconstruction, and ego-fictions, most viewers will all-too-easily identify with Lenny's painfully hopeless and terrifyingly arbitrary quest to hold reality steady as is it fizzles and flits away."

","""Memento"" is a sleaze-ball suspense movie with a twist. As if you don't know it yet, the scenes are played all jumbled and out of order.<br/><br/>What could have turned into just a nasty trick on the viewer is actually very well-done here. You see things from the perspective of our main character who suffers from a bizarre memory loss condition. Rather than explain the plot, I will just say that if you plan on watching this movie just once, get ready to change your plans. You will need to watch it twice to fully GET it. It moves too fast for the viewer and by the time it's over you will tell yourself that you GET it, but you don't.<br/><br/>To those who say there are no holes in this film I scoff at you. Why does Leonard have no memory loss in the murder sequence? He remembers long enough to drive all the way to that abandoned building and then wait for the murderer. In other scenes, he forgets what he is doing after two minutes. Maybe he is just psychotic and made the whole condition up in his mind to excuse a rampage? The hypotheses are endless. Personally, I'd rather watch a movie that just makes sense on it's own and no matter what you say, this one doesn't. ""Memento"" tries to do what ""Pulp Fiction"" did but takes itself way too seriously. The viewers are treated to a narrative from the character Teddy at the end when he has to explain the situation to Leonard thus explaining the movie to us. Kind of cheap, Nolan.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure: Guy Pearce is one of the best actors alive.<br/><br/>7 out of 10, kids."

","What I generally look for in a good movie is character development.  If nothing changes in the characters' personalities, I have trouble enjoying the film, as it loses a certain sense of realism.  One method of character development that I particularly enjoy is that of the ""revealing"" method, finding out more about a person's personality by being shown information. Many people mention The Usual Suspects when reviewing Memento and I can't help using it as well.  This method of character development is used very well in that movie also, in the twist at the end.  I felt that Leonard's character developed extremely well in that we were shown bits of his personality at a time and it was not until the end that we found out what he was truly all about.  *Spoiler comment at end*<br/><br/>This film, with its memory-troubled main character, reminded me of a sub-plot in the Kurt Vonnegut novel, The Sirens of Titan, in which the main Character, Malachi Constant, must endure repetitive memory wipes, only knowing what is going on by re-reading a series of notes that he writes to himself.<br/><br/>I was going to mention something else about Memento, but I forgot it.

","I was totally blown away by this movie. I think this is a total masterpiece. I wish I could have thought of something as ingenious as this. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good mystery, acting, editing, directing, plot. I can and have watched it over and over again. This should have won for best picture the year it came out. Go out and rent it. Go and watch it. Go out and buy it. you will not be disappointed. This movie is about a guy who loses his short term memory and tries to hunt down his wife's rapist and killer. I won't say anything else. It is a masterpiece, thought not perfect it probably should be about a 9.8 on the IMDb but I'll give it a 10 out of 10."
"sleestaker","1","38","66","25 September 2002"," One big gimmick
","As I write this, Memento is listed as number 10 on IMDb's top 250. It is ahead of Apocalypse Now, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Dr. Strangelove, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Lawrence of Arabia, The Graduate, Raging Bull, The Sting, The Empire Strikes Back, The Wizard of Oz, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Deer Hunter, Gone With the Wind, every Hitchcock movie, every Woody Allen movie, and every Kurosawa movie, except Seven Samurai, just to name a few.<br/><br/>To hear the people on this board tell it, Memento is the 21st century's Godfather or Citizen Kane. I rented this film because of all the high praise it received. What I was treated to was an average film with only one outstanding performance (Joe Pantoliano), enough plot holes to drive a Jaguar through, and a gigantic gimmick that is as essential to the film as the shark is to Jaws.<br/><br/>The movie is chopped into a number of scenes and shown in reverse. If one were to re-edit the film and show it front to back, it would be devoid of suspense. All the ""cerebral puzzles"" etc. would be gone. Even in its weird order, it's not all that deep. The director uses the sequencing and the protagonists's disorder to keep the viewer guessing. It's all a big trick, and by the end, the viewer is just relieved that it is over.<br/><br/>There may be real people who suffer from this inability to create new memories, but I highly doubt they are able to function effectively as Pearce's character did. Nor do they have a network of friends who help them function and fail to get them professional help, especially when they are on a homicidal vendetta.<br/><br/>Do not waste your time here. This movie has been rated highly by a bunch of people who mistake directorial sleight of hand for real movie magic. Rent any of the films I mentioned in the first paragraph. They actually deserve their praise."
"tedg","Null","28","47","14 May 2001"," Skin as Photograph
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I rate this very high on my scale, primarily for its ambition and intellect.<br/><br/>Usually I get annoyed at IMDB comments that report the story as if it were important, but it is here:<br/><br/>---Lenny's home is attacked, wife raped, him injured. He develops this `condition' which has no physical cause. In other words, the condition is invented. The insurance investigator (Sammy Jankins), uncovers him as a fraud by using electrified test blocks. Knowing this, his wife challenges him and he `accidentally' kills her rather than face the condition. Sent to a hospital, he escapes and ties up with the cop who investigated the case. Together, they track down the petty crook and kill him. Over time, the condition becomes more pronounced and embedded. The cop (Teddy) is crooked and exploits Lenny in a doublecross drug deal, getting him to kill Jimmy. Jimmy's girlfriend Natalie also manipulates Lenny to first chase off Dodd (who is looking for the missing money). Lenny decides to get even with Teddy, so plants a seed that he will use later to justify killing Teddy.<br/><br/>---It is essential to know that Lenny was never an insurance investigator, and that his condition is self-delusional. The order and ritual is not to cope with, but to create the condition. Remembering his wife increases the intensity behind the psychosis -- remembering his investigator gives him identity and focus in refining the condition -- knowing all this transforms the idea behind the film into something of genius.<br/><br/>That's because it is deeply self-referential: us looking at a film, especially at a mystery, is just the same as looking at a few polaroids and trying to create/remember a past. Watching movies is self-delusional, and with detective stories it is a game of wits between viewer and writer to outwit and manipulate each other just as here between Lenny and Teddy. (The filmmaker calls us, we shouldn't answer, but we forget.) This film goes further. An actor forms the picture by putting words on it; in the case of acting, the `picture' is the body, so it makes sense for the clue/words to appear on his body.<br/><br/>The combination of the three (words on skin, remembrances of images past, the mind duel with the writer) adds up to a pretty mind-expanding framework. That alone transports the intelligent viewer to another world, a shocking world of self. This makes the film important, and an important film deserves criticism.<br/><br/>So what could be better?<br/><br/>The ink on skin as referential of film acting was done so much more elegantly and deeply with `Pillow Book.' The playing with time was moderately clever compared to the other, deeper games in this film -- but it could have been much more challenging. It could have stuttered (`Limey') could have folded (`Pulp Fiction') could have paralleled (`Run Lola Run') could have spiralled deeper (`Snake Eyes'). Maybe in the next film.<br/><br/>I did not think the eye of the camera was very clever. This had `noirish' writing but not filming. More like the later `DOA' in the black and white would have really spun. The dialog and plot were needlessly simple. If I am going to go to the trouble to displace my mind for a day or two, I want it shifted beyond Jupiter. That the story was so simple was pandering to the dumb masses and annoyed.<br/><br/>But the biggest flaw was our friend Guy. Moss is not a real actress. Guy is, but he's of the rather simple kind, who thinks he plays a character. Consider what this film is: it is a film about films first, and within that we have a character inventing another character and reality. That's three roles in one. Woody Allen made a similar movie so far as this matter: `Sweet and Lowdown.' It was a fake documentary about a guy who created a stage persona which he subsequently adopted. Simple stuff plotwise compared to `Memento.' But it had Sean Penn. Watch Sean play three roles at once, weaving them into a complex multidimensional space. This film was intelligent enough in its conception to warrant such texture, to have the actor remind us that we are him and he isn't."

","Excellent movie. This movie shows Nolan's early spirit in movie making, as this is his second feature film. However this is not for everyone. Even if you're a die-hard Nolan fan, you still might not like it. It was in my cup of tea, so I loved it. The movie is a complete mind bender. It doesn't play in order. It jumps from the past to present a TON of times, so it can be a hell lot of confusing. It's a slow movie, but fantastic. It grabs your attention from the start till the end. The suspense builds stronger as every second ticks by. If you haven't seen it go see it now, because in the second part of my review I'm going to talk about the ending. The ending is something to talk about. There is a plot twist at the end, rather twistS. It is one of the most unpredictable twists ever.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert!<br/><br/>As many of you have seen the movie, you will know the ending is completely mind blowing. I never expected that Leo had killed the attacker over a year ago, and that now he kept forgetting and believed that the killer is still alive. Also another crazy twist was when Teddy told Leo that Leo's wife survived the attack, and that Leo himself killed her by accident with an insulin overdose. The real shocker was when it was revealed that Leo was mixing Sammy's life with his life. Everything that was said about Sammy, indeed revealed Leo's life. Totally mind blowing. There were like 3-4 twists at the end, which blew me away. To be honest, I didn't even expect one of the twists. I was blown away because there were many twists at the end, and none of them were predictable. From all the movies I've seen this movie had the second biggest twist ending, right after ""The Prestige"", also by Nolan.<br/><br/>This movie is very suspenseful and interesting. It doesn't let your interest leave until the very end. In short, fantastic movie and it deserves at least one watch. For me many more watches. Nolan never disappoints. Not one of his movies disappointed me, and I've seen all his movies, including his short films."
"budmassey","1","53","102","5 September 2001"," A monumentally over-rated wankfest.
","After all this time, I am still not sure why I hate this movie so much. Perhaps it is because so much undeserved praise was heaped on this pretentious and presumptuous MTV video with aspirations to being a ""serious"" movie. It meanders, sometimes careens, from one gratuitous plot twist to the next, yet in reality very little actually happens. In the end, this is not a bad approach if we are going to get character development instead. Alas, none is here. The characters might as well have had their profiles tattooed on them, like the main character does, because they are no less obvious and devoid of subtlety. <br/><br/>Memento confuses plot intricacy for story, of which there is precious little here. Granted the story had to be sparse to further the self-conscious conceit that ties up this formulaic and trite little package with a bow. Now don't get me wrong. Any film that causes us to reconsider what we think we know and to see things in ways to which we are not accustomed is great. But that must not be confused with clumsy subterfuges designed to suggest one thing and mean another. That's just plain silly and cheap, a mindless maze that wanders aimlessly until the author runs out of gas. That's what we have here.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce, the Other Australian Actor, is good, reminding me at times of Brad Pitt before he demonstrated so convincingly time and again his epic lack of talent. Unlike Brad, though, Guy is talented. Perhaps too talented for such a claustrophobic little film. And what's up with Joe Pantoliano? Let's see, maybe we can give just him a sandwich board to carry around announcing his ulterior motive in every scene. He is the most typecast actor around, and he could phone in a performance with more mystery and finesse. <br/><br/>Still without Guy and Joe, formidable talents in better vehicles, this film would be desolate. Oh, there's lots of little black and white vignettes, and the story is told backwards which has been universally acclaimed as genius, but which, at least for me, smacks of artifice and cliché.<br/><br/>Look beyond the gimmickry, and you have a film that aches for a purpose, a theme, a message. What it has instead is a sort of Michael Mann vapidity that even throws in the car and the suit. Holy Don Johnson, Batman.<br/><br/>I cannot begin to tell you how over-rated this movie is. It is a favorite of ersatz intellectuals who want to prove their smarts and congratulate themsevles by ""figuring out"" this empty, pointless wankfest of a monumentally overrated movie."

","Memento is one of the most original, and stunning movies I have ever seen. Memento is close to an epic masterpiece. They take a simple plot, and mix it up with all these different chronologically strategies. (This time using several chronologically mixed scenes). One man wanting revenge for those who killed and raped his wife, his memory the only thing stopping him. But Memento takes you through a journey of strategy, notes, pictures, black-mail and surprises. It certainly lives up to the hype, and remains as Nolan's best movie. A guarantee I can almost give to all viewers is that: they'll be things that seem a little mixed up after your first viewing, that's normal. I have watched Memento two times, closely and yet, still they're a few unanswered questions. Memento delivers in all aspects, a intriguingly thriller with an opinionated ending."
"the red duchess","9","13","21","15 November 2000"," Brilliant culmination of a series of anti-detective thrillers.(possible spoilers)
","It is refreshing to see a (relatively) mainstream thriller that does not follow the tired old rules, that uses Resnais, rather than Mel Gibson, as a starting point, that substitutes for an inevitable linear plot a temporal time bomb, where the straight line of events is smashed to pieces and put together with seeming haphazardness.  Further, this plot is told completely from one character's point-of-view, a character as we by now know, with short-term memory.  His great boast is that he remembers his identity and memory up until the accident - the denouement suggests that even this is a myth.<br/><br/>So what is the plot we're watching?  Has the emotional shock of finally getting revenge had the required, cathartic effect, and that Leonard Shelby is now piecing back the bits of remembered past?  Or is he, in effect, a dead man, if we agree that someone does not exist as an identity without memory, exists in a kind of limbo, and that this dead Leonard is watching his life flashing before (or behind) him?  <br/><br/>As all the 'revelations' at the end take place in the narrative's begining, Leonard is denied all the action hero's usual rewards - increased self-knowledge, knowledge of the world and the plot.  He is given the answers at the start of his plot, and forgets them.  Leonard at the end (his beginning) is a more coherent character than at the beginning (his end) - is this just because we've given a mass of (highly dubious) information by then and think we know him and his situation better?  Or is he, as his narrative progresses, getting vaguer, moving towards inertia, the catatonia that finally swamped his altar-ego Sammy Jankis.  <br/><br/>Our problem is that the film comprises not one plot, but four, all fragmented, full of gaping black holes, all mediated by this character who knows nothing.  One is Leonard's narrative as he sees it, as he tries to avenge his wife's murder.  The second is told in monochrome flashback (or whatever this is called in a film that runs backward), mostly told in mysterious phone calls, and seem to flesh out the gaps missing in the first plot, but actually creates more. The third is the 'real' plot that may have something to do with cops, snitches, femmes fatales, or may be hallucinated, misremembered by Leonard, or simply planted there as cover for another plot, or may not even exist at all.  The fourth is the story of Sammy, who suffered the same 'condition' as Leonard.<br/><br/>All four are obviously connected with each other to create a discordant fugue, but each undermines the other; in a sense, hell is other plots, and Leonard is in hell.  We can only take the opening sequence, where Leonard stands holding a fading photograph over a dead man's bloody body as the only 'reliable' image, and in this 'reliable' image, another, the photograph, is slipping away, ungraspable, like Leonard's memory, like the film.<br/><br/>In another sense, though, what this film does is what any detective story does, which is work its way bakwards from the crime to its source.  This is what Dupin, Holmes and Poirot do, followed by legions of TV and movie detectvies.  This film just takes this journey literally.  In a conventional detective story, this travelling into the past is a way of making the present and future safe, of reasserting order, of filling up the gaps.  As Leonard doesn't succeed in reaching the source, and as the audience flounders too, there can be no reassertion of present and future. <br/><br/>
Leonard is the logical conclusion of a long line of anti-detectives, figures who do not solve the crime, who are personally implicated in the investigation, and are eventually destroyed by it.  'Vertigo''s Scottie Ferguson is the most famous example, others include 'The Spider's Strategem', 'Blow-up' and 'The Parallax View'.  These films offer detectives who do not order chaos, who cannot reorder the world, in the way Holmes used to.  Crime, solution and detective get lost in a temporal vacuum, never to be saved.  <br/><br/>These abstractions are firmly grounded in 'Memento' in the body and the eye; Guy Pearce's rather splendid physique as palimpsest, where history is recorded at random, where the keys of interpretation are lost.  The split between mind and body is complete, and with it the essence of our unified humanity.  Similarly, with all the Polaroids he takes, the camera may never lie, but, as discrete entities, images are meaningless, in narrative terms anyway."

","Memento sees Guy Pearce play Leonard Shelby, a man with no short term memory, on a search for his wife's killer in a film which is intelligent, engaging, well thought out, and sometimes, even funny. <br/><br/>Memento demands your full concentration, and its backwards development is a stroke of genius, placing you in the same situation as Leonard; you see what he sees, and aside from small clues, very little else. This way of engaging its audience is what makes Memento special, as it draws you into the plot and Leonard's complex situation without leaving you lost amidst the chronology or bogged down in little clues. This is also helped by Guy Pearce's performance; he remains likable for most of the film, his little jokes and his honesty helping you side with him, but he also shows evidence of a darker side, especially towards the end (the beginning?), as Teddy (Pantoliano) plants the seed of doubt in his mind.<br/><br/>Basically, Memento is a very good film, an intelligent, engaging storyline that keeps you interested even after it ends."

My wife gave up after less than half of it. I forced myself to see it through, because I hoped there was something to redeem it. Well, there wasn't. Complex? Nothing worthwile is revealed after the first half, actually, the thing is pretty much clear after the first scene - never mind the sordid detail revealed later, doen't add anything for me. An uninteresting, unbelievable, unappealing story acted out by characters one cannot get oneself to care for. So it's told backwards, big deal. I've seen similar things before, done much better. No short term memory? Try ""Winter Sleepers"", that idea is used there much better. Acting? The characters had to look bewildered and smarmy, in turns. Not a great range, in my opinion.

","It eludes me how this movie has gotten such high ratings and even two Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>This movie is for the most part mind-boggling boring, with endless repetitive sequences of how our main character writes notes, tries to remember certain events or persons. This goes on for about 80% of the movie in an desperate attempt to create ""suspense""...but it gets tiresome. The end admittedly had a moderate surprising twist...however, from a certain point of view, the end was also predictable and, somehow, disappointing. The only positive thing about the movie is a good performance by Carrie Ann Moss, however the main character did not convince me, neither did the plot. (If there was one, besides of a repetitive line-up of the character's confusion and attempts by him to puzzle together memories.) This movie is breathtakingly boring and the ending *extremely* underwhelming. One of the movies which is praised about all over, you watch it - and it turns out a huge disappointment."
"LoveCoates","1","44","88","16 December 2001"," Not so much a movie as an intellectual display...Films should be made for audiences, not for filmmakers
","Sigh.<br/><br/>Let me first point out the tremendous amount of good in this film.<br/><br/>First, Christopher Nolan and young filmmakers like him are to be commended and supported for stretching cinematic conventions and taking chances with the medium. Memento is certainly an important film, a very innovative move from the older flashback structure that has gotten to be somewhat overused. What a refreshing directorial debut, to the point that I think it rivals Orson Welles's famous directorial debut. Kudos to Chris Nolan!<br/><br/>Also, there is Guy Pearce. He is outstanding in what must have been an extremely challenging role, and I cannot praise him enough. He succeeds in making us feel sympathetic for a character we never really understand, and that is indeed difficult. To me, this performance is head and shoulders above most if not all lead male performances of the same year.<br/><br/>Skip the bad, onto the ugly.<br/><br/>Some have tried to give the rest of this film the benefit of the doubt. I cannot. This is another one of those annoying intellectual-exercises-disguised-as-motion-picture a la American Beauty whose popularity I can only ascribe to their sheer complexity. The latter tried to use a complex theme to pass for worth; this one tries a complex structure.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the foundation of a good movie will always be a good, cogent story with strong, well-developed characters (at least in my opinion). Memento has neither. Told forwards, the plot (or non-plot) would be mediocre, even boring. As it is, told backwards, it just makes no sense. I'm not sure it would make sense told regularly. Inventiveness is great, but it is not enough to make a film one of the greatest films of all time (ahem, Citizen Kane). I would put Memento up there with Kane as one of the greatest DIRECTORIAL EFFORTS of all time. But simply put, great direction alone does not equal great film. There are also such things as writing and character, which have been lost in the age of the auteur.<br/><br/>I cannot be the first to have noticed the plot's crucial non-sequitor. If the main character couldn't remember anything after the incident, he wouldn't be able to remember that he has a memory problem. However, he constantly tells people this, and it proves to be of central importance to the plot (which is full of other holes). He also has nothing that he would see every morning to remind him. I understand that in real life, this condition does allow you to remember some things, but the film makes it clear that the main character remembers nothing. I'm not merely picking at the film, for this plot hole actually is the plot. And I'm not quite sure how Chris Nolan or anybody involved with the film managed to miss it. Maybe they didn't care? That's likely, because this film does center more around slick direction than great writing.<br/><br/>There is a saying that applies: to break the rules, you need to know them. This movie could have been brilliant if Christopher Nolan had taken the time to write a wonderful movie in real time. THEN, had he decided to tell it backwards, the effect, if done right, would have been awesome. However, I left this film just as confused as I was throughout. Even the endless speech at the end that was (I think?) supposed to tie everything up did not help, not to mention the fact that the ""long explanation by an authority"" is a trite, amateur denouement to begin with. It hasn't really worked since Psycho -- which, lord have mercy, is apparently a lesser film than Memento according to IMDB voters -- since the Psycho ending speech was merely tying up loose ends that the audience already knew rather than rewriting the film in seconds like this one does.<br/><br/>Frankly, I'm sick of movies that cater either to the box office (Titanic, Gladiator), or critics (American Beauty & now Memento), and somehow end up being branded as great. Movies should be watchable and entertaining, not simply there to win awards so that film nerds can pat each other on the back congratulating their brilliance.<br/><br/>If you want writing, character, plot, direction AND complexity, see The Shawshank Redemption or All About Eve. Memento is not the movie for you, and so far its the most overrated movie of the century."

","and a rating of 1.<br/><br/>Watching this until the end and back a few minutes of the beginning is, TOTAL IRRITATION.<br/><br/>The ONLY unique element of this movie is that scenes are played backwards and every time the man reads the note taken in previous scenes so that you can understand the confusion of someone with short term memory loss. A secondary element is that, similar to the case in Shutter Island, this man's hallucinations forged his memory into distortion so that later on he realized that even the name imprinted on his body wasn't fact but invented by himself.<br/><br/>The main character was supposed to be a 'disciplined and organized' person, or in short, highly logical being. But he turned out to be a stupid and conceited retard.<br/><br/>Yes, it particularly amazed me that every word thrown at him by Natalie (played by Moss) when she tricked him into her puppet and changed the course of his revenge fits him perfectly - a freaky venereal disease-ridden retard who did a pretty poor job in taking notes, which is the very central element in this movie.<br/><br/>And so in the end his stupidity drove him into killing a good friend, a good person. I wouldn't say it's emotional devastation but total irritation.<br/><br/>I dislike Christopher Nolan too. It's not that I don't enjoy his movies but there is no sense of logic in most of them, Inception in particular.

The acting was first rate, the story decent, and the film makers did a great job putting it all together.<br/><br/>However, I may be crazy, and I'm sure the ""film snobs"" will grit their teeth at this, but at the end of the day, isn't Memento just a gimmick? A water cooler novelty? I mean, basically they took a slightly above average plot and did something new, and granted inventive, by editing the film structure in reverse. For the most part, the movie is pretty much shown from end to beginning. Yes, they did enough to make things make sense in between, but essentially it was an exercise in ""hey, let's make a movie, and then edit it so everyone will talk about that reverse movie"".<br/><br/>I don't care what anyone says. That's the bottom line, period. I've talked with plenty of fellow movie buffs who I consider to be reasonably intelligent, and some are even the snob-types mentioned above. And none of us can figure out what all the fuss is about. Maybe we ain't that smart.<br/><br/>I hate to get into comparisons, because it's difficult to compare different types of movies. But be honest, if you can tell me with a straight face that Memento is an overall better film than ""Apocalypse Now"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Fight Club"", ""Jaws"", ""Chinatown"", ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", ""American Beauty"", ""Silence of the Lambs"" and a large chunk of the other 230 films ranked below it, than you just need to sit back, take a deep breath, reel in that massive ""I'm a nonconformist art-house movie aficionado"" thing and get a reality check.

THAT'S what just doesn't add up.<br/><br/>You know how Quentin Tarantino creates all those scenes that gen X think are awesome, but are just physics challenged? You know the world doesn't work like that, and there's no plot reason to violate the laws of physics, but Quentin thought it would be neat and his sheep think so too?

It allows for the a priori decision to do this from a POV view that is, well quite frankly, produced by managing to insert one's head far up one's rectum. <br/><br/>The jokes aren't even funny. This movie scares me. It scares me that there is a whole population of people that can identify with what the screen writer and director were trying to do. A lot of the glowing reviews are the only one written by the author, so there could be a good deal of ""paid buzz"" generation going on here as well. Bottom line, if you actually liked Kill Bill or Blair Witch, you will probably find this awesome. If Pulp Fiction made you want to go out and take a cattle prod to the first gen X you could grab, then you'll hate this.<br/><br/>Very sad that I will no longer be able to trust IMDb ratings any more, but when complete and utter rubbish gets an 8.5...

A friend even told me that he thought it was an amazing movie--though he didn't quite totally understand it.  Maybe it is appealing because it is confusing and people view it as a ""smart"" film because they can't quite follow totally what it going on and they have to watch it over and over again.  Either way, I believe it has received much more acclaim than it deserves.  It has certainly won many awards for great editing and original screenplays, etc--which it has.  But a movie of the year--or of all time as some IMDB users are rating it--I totally disagree.<br/><br/>Finally, It is indeed totally original in the way a story is told and presented, but it is certainly not the greatest movie of all time.  I was disappointed overall with this film.  I do not believe it is a must-see.<br/><br/>I could film an entire movie by attaching a camera to a dogs back and having him film the action, then playing it on the big screen mirrored and upside-down during some scenes.  That would certainly be an original idea never seen by movie-goers before, but that doesn't mean it should be voted into a group with The Godfather or Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>I'm not saying Memento is like watching an upside-down film from a dog's point of view...

I don't think they will spoil the movie totally for you, but they might lower your expectations towards this movie, and you might even decide not to spend money or precious time on it :<br/><br/>The movie is told backwards, so the viewer has no memory of what happened ""before"", like the protagonist.

","First of all, this is not a horrible movie.  It does keep you mildly interested.  But it has several, fatal flaws. <br/><br/>One reviewer mentioned that the film was too clever by half.  I totally concur.  The film went out of its way to create something unique, and in the process lost the entire narrative structure.  So when it ends, you barely even know if it happened.  In fact, you don't know that it happened.  If Leonard was delusional about Sammy, then perhaps he was delusional about all the characters in the movie.  The fact is, you will never know.<br/><br/>The problem is, this doesn't make for a good film.  Good films are those where the narrative art is enhanced by the photography.  By this measure, the movie fails, as the photography does almost nothing to tell the story, and Guy Pearce is as milquetoast a leading man as there is.  The fact is, the film is about trying to put you in his shoes, to show you what Leonard must have felt like living with no memory, but you end up feeling nothing at all because he is such a bland character actor.  <br/><br/>I would compare this film in some ways to Se7en--except that Se7en does a much better job telling the story (even if the ending wasn't at all surprising).  The major difference is that you care about what happens to the characters in Se7en.  There is no empathy with Leonard, partly because the film never gives you the chance because it's too busy being clever.<br/><br/>Perhaps people will rate it highly, but it is definitely not a Citizen Kane or Casablanca, a movie where you can take it out and watch it over and over again.  It's far too dismal for that.

","Never thought I would see a more terrible movie than 'The Piano' but this was it. Now, I have nothing against films that backtrack - sometimes this is used in films to very good effect - but what we see in 'Memento' is just plain ridiculous. Boring scenes are repeated ad infinitum as the film constantly goes back, then forward to scenes we've seen already, and then go further back only to then run forward into those same scenes again. This is not clever, it may be different, but it's also stupid. Now, all this might even be bearable if you feel any empathy or sympathy with the main character, or anybody, or anything in this. No such luck with 'Memento'. The only positive emotion I felt in the whole thing was when the main character was running down the street and couldn't remember why. At least that was funny.

","I sincerely don't understand why so many people find that movie so good and have ranked it so high.

I am sick and tired of people pretending they are real cinema ""connaisseurs"" always referring to mostly recent big American blockbusters which by the way are getting worst and worst for decades... I recently discovered the IMDb site and was very satisfy with its content at first. But the comments are mostly made by north American residents (wich i am by the way, living in french speaking city of Québec) who rarely see foreign countries films... That ignorance of foreign cinema led people to rank ""Memento"" in the top 10 of this database. I mean come on and please do me the favor to open your eyes a bit! If you don't want to commence by viewing old black & white classics which could seem boring for young audience, please try with contemporary directors as Austrian Michael Haneke or French François Ozon who made wonderfully original movies like ""Code Unknown"" or ""Swiming Pool"" which are i think even available in dubbed versions for an English audience. So make an effort and search for it instead of being crazy about nonsense movies such as ""Memento"" or Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" Otherwise, do like me and watch old fashion classics from Orson Wells, John Huston or H.G. Clouzot...etc.<br/><br/>Julien in Quebec city."

","I can scarcely believe the cult status this film seems to be getting here at the IMDb board. It's a totally enigmatic mess of a nightmare ""from end to beginning"", to coin a phrase based on the fact that the story is told backwards.<br/><br/>If it made even one iota of sense to me, it was only toward the end when I had a clue as to what I suspected all along. But even then, nothing was clear and much of the story is unresolved so that you, the viewer, can fill in all the gaps depending on how brilliant and imaginative your mind is.<br/><br/>The storytelling technique used here is a tricky one and altogether unsuccessful, in my opinion. As far as I'm concerned, short term memory would be a blessing if only to forget this one entirely. The payoff is zero, as Leonard Maltin has already suggested, and makes watching a film like this a total waste of time.<br/><br/>GUY PEARCE does an okay job in the central role but his talent is totally wasted in a script that is as ungrounded in reality as his character is supposed to be. The film itself is all style and no substance, as pretentious and manipulating as any film can be that does not respect its audience.<br/><br/>JOE PANTOLIANO and CARRIE-ANNE MOSS are competent but their characters are given coarse language full of expletives that should have been directed at the script they were forced to recite rather than inflicted upon a viewer patiently trying to follow a deliberately incomprehensible storyline. What hurts here, is there is no real solution to the puzzle, leaving the audience just as confused as the central character.<br/><br/>What should have been a taut film noir turns out to be nothing more than a cheap shot at manipulation.<br/><br/>Apparently, audiences these days are willing to swallow anything that seems unusual or offbeat in its appeal but--even so--there is no way I can account for the sort of comments I see here. Are we watching the same film???"

","First time I saw this movie, I got a little confused, but, at the same time, I was amazed by the director Chris Nolan's work. The history is so fantastic and the format of the movie is so audacious that i became a real fan, bought the movie and watched it every day for like two weeks.<br/><br/>Nolan talks to us in the movie through the little details. The space in Lenny's chest is one that becomes interesting in, at least, three different moments: when he shows it to Natalie at her place, when he sees himself pointing at it in a Polaroid picture and in the end, when he remembers his wife while going to the tattoo shop. In this last scene, the space appears filled with the message ""I've done it"". I believe this blank space summarizes his pointless odyssey, I mean: it will always be blank, although he knows, deep inside, that it should be filled with that message. It is a proof that he won't stop.<br/><br/>The way Lenny feels his hand aching as he speaks to Natalie (after beating her), the way all people use him to their own purposes, the little details that prove that Sammy Jankins' history is his own (the scene with a needle that flashes his mind as he lays on Natalie's sofa and the talking with Teddy in the end/beginning), his deepest reflections about his condition (""How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?"" or ""I can't remember to forget you""), all those elements are the ingredients for this real masterpiece. A movie that proves to us in a weird, yet ingenious, way how we lie to ourselves to live, how far can we go to give our lives a meaning and face the awful truth."
"Lucabrasisleeps","10","7","11","21 November 2008"," Christopher Nolan is a magician
","Christopher Nolan is a magician. No other way to put it.<br/><br/>This movie ended up on my top ten list when I saw it a few years ago. It is one of the most original thrillers to have come from America and it supposedly became popular solely on the basis of word of mouth.<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce in an excellent performance) is a man who has short term memory loss. He is a man on a mission. He is determined to find out who killed his wife. He has various ways to remind himself of small facts - writing them on notes and sticking them on the wall, tattooing facts on his body and so on. The story also involves two other characters - Natalie and a man named Teddy who seems to have a shady past. There is also the story of Sammy Jenkis which is told in bits and pieces by Leonard in disjointed scenes. Sammy also had the same problem which led to Sammy being placed in a mental institution.<br/><br/>The main feature of this movie is that it goes backwards. Which means that the scene that follows is actually the incident which happens prior to the current situation. This is quite demanding for the viewer and people with short attention spans may not appreciate this movie so much. Repeated viewings may be required to actually understand what is going on in the movie.<br/><br/>What I liked about the movie was the fact that despite the complex and confusing style, it is ultimately a movie which is not inaccessible. It is no art film which might bore viewers to tears. It is a fast moving thriller which can keep a viewer hooked and this is what separates Memento from other such complex thrillers. Most importantly, it is the little facts and clues that are the most interesting. The loose ends are tied up expertly at the end with such brilliance that I am still at awe at the execution even several years after watching this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it is in fact quite depressing. There is not one likable character in this movie, except for Leonard, and we see how his medical condition is used by people to serve their own interests. It presents a bleak view of human nature, in many ways.<br/><br/>As far as the performances are concerned, Guy Pearce is fabulous as the determined but confused Leonard Shelby. Carrie Anne moss is brilliant as the mysterious Natalie who may have other motives in helping Leonard. She has the right kind of mix of beauty and mysteriousness which make her perfect for the role. Joe Pantaliano as Teddy makes a big impact in this movie. His dry humour and screen presence make this role one of my favourite performances on film.<br/><br/>Altogether, it is one of the best films of recent years and it is exactly the kind of movie I like.<br/><br/>10/10"

This film, however clever and witty it is, does not live up to this ranking.  I am a huge fan of the film The Usual Suspects, and was disappointed to find that this film also ranked first place under the category of thriller.  Right above The Usual Suspects.  Memento is a very clever film, yet it does not create the pull that a thriller needs because it takes so long to tell what is happening.  In other words, the movie goes by kind of slowly.  Another mute point that caught my attention was the ending.  Although it left the viewer with something to think about, it didn't give you the "" oh-my gosh-that's-fricken-cool"" feel that a thriller is supposed to leave you with.  To see a truly classic example of a real thriller, you need to see The Usual Suspects.  I do, however, recommend this film.  It uses a unique backwards storyline that makes it very interesting to watch.  Guy Pearce does an excellent job playing a character who cannot produce new memories, and Joe P. delivers his always entertaining performance.

At first the film looked and felt like its predecessor(e.g. The Usual Suspects, Shallow Grave etc) - smart, intellectual and armed with a modern day cynicism. It maintains a respectful emotional distance from its audience as this is ethical(don't ask me why) and a reasonable price for being the uber-cool pic that it is. Memento would thus have been fantastic if it stayed that way.<br/><br/>But Nolan got greedy, he misrepresented the film with hints that it could be more than the sum of its parts, that it could transcend its genre origins and segue into a realm of cinema reserved by a select few films(e.g. ""Magnolia"", ""Dancer in the Dark""). A film which demanded not only intellectual subscription but a level of emotional investment or even wild abandonment that ensure people like me will embrace it fully, should the investment pay off.<br/><br/>I got hooked by this heightened anticipation and was almost ready to kiss the feet of Mr Nolan by film's half-time. However, the way he chose to end the film rubbed me the wrong way in more ways than I care to describe. At the last minute, he chose to cling on to his ""uber-cool film"" safety net, suddenly  distancing itself from the emotional guise built up throughout the film. <br/><br/>The final revelation? The joke is on me. The audience were being talked down at and made fun of for having feelings, for showing empathy, for being human. There is nothing clever in that.<br/><br/>There goes, this may be my longest piece ever for ""a film I struggled to love but may never"". Its been months since I last saw Memento. With each passing day, I hold ""Memento"" in higher esteem as an visionary film from a cinematic standpoint. But with each passing day, I become increasingly disappointed with its sinister agenda of tainting all values that I hold true. <br/><br/>Alas, this to me is thus, ""The film that could have been""."

The film is built upon this style, showing you a present-time snippet of the main character which leaves you wondering about why he got there and what he's doing. The film then continues showing you a snippet of the immediate preceding past of the main character, and so on backwards in time helping you understand the beginning of the film. That's where the movie's originality stops. The plot itself is filled with huge holes. While the premise is interesting, it is hardly plausible that someone with no short-term memory would not be 'assisted' by society in any way, nor that he could not have a notebook handcuffed to him or something rather than all the tattoos. I found the movie rather predictable and did not really care about the movie after about halfway through.<br/><br/>Still, an interesting and innovative movie-making style with a neat, if unplausible, situation for the main character.

I got the impression that 'Memento' thinks its better than it really is.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent and unique thriller, but the rating is misleading and not a true reflection of the quality of the film.

"C22Man","2","7","12","17 July 2016"," As Hollow as it is Pretentious
","Memento is a film that I will never be able to understand the hype around. A curious but completely uninvolving piece from a director often criticised for being all brain and no heart (maybe the signs for that began earlier than most think). The whole draw of the film was its backwards moving narrative which reveals the details of the story in reverse order. I can only ask, what happens when that isn't enough? Take that away and this is a lacklustre, rambling, confused film that is trying to bite off more than it can chew. <br/><br/>No matter how much you try to get away from it, the film is based entirely around a gimmick. Sure it's an inventive one, but you take that away and you're left with a bland murder mystery that plays out with equally dull individuals. Our lead character Leonard suffers from a form of amnesia, were he can't create new memories, and is trying to figure out who killed his wife by using clues that he has already created. This structure itself is just a mess. We see Leonard write on polaroid's and try to recall events, we see a scene play out, then another scene happen which is connected to the beginning of what we just saw and so on. I'm not exaggerating, over two thirds of the film are exactly that. It gets tiresome about half an hour in. There's no suspense or mystery because we've just seen what will happen, so what's there to be invested in? How he got there isn't of any interest.<br/><br/>The film is ice cold. Too distant. Far out of reach. Way too impersonal. There is no way the audience can get connected to anything that takes place. The film makes no attempt to get us to sympathise with Leonard bar his mental obstacle, which isn't enough, and the rest of the characters are just sleazebags or wholly unpleasant. The actions of the characters make little sense, even once you find out their true motivation. Teddy's role is one which should have been mysterious and gripping, but it started off as baffling and ended up making no sense whatsoever by the time the film concludes. I actually realised that I wouldn't have cared at all about anything that takes place in the film if it had been told in chronological order. The further it progressed (or is it regressed?), the more detached and bored I felt. <br/><br/>In Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano you have some fine actors that are completely wasted in parts that don't allow them to do anything of interest. All of them are shackled to the plot and restrained as a result. I feel for Pearce the most, he's playing a character so thinly sketched and loaded with quirks that there's virtually nothing he can do with the role. It's here that the entire narrative device falls down too. If it is trying to put us in his shoes then it fails because we feel nothing for the character. Beyond that Leonard is simply a muddled lead, and not just because of amnesia. He has tattoos all over his body that offer him information which he doesn't remember getting and yet he trusts what is written completely. If he has no short-term memory then how can he believe any of the details to be correct? That's not even nit-picking, that's a major flaw that isn't explained. There are a host of plot holes like that based around the entire memory loss area. <br/><br/>This is clearly Nolan's attempt to craft a twisting film that can measure up to the ones made by the likes of Kubrick and Hitchcock. Something deeply psychological and with a noir twinge, with the reverse chronology being an added bonus. His first problem is that he doesn't create suspense properly. Partly because we're already a step ahead of the characters, partly because he's given us characters that we cannot gain a connection to. Then you have the writing. The dialogue is painfully simple at times, just lacking any dynamism or sharpness that could hold our attention. It's as if Nolan thinks the characters have to spell out what already a simple plot because we're too stupid to get it. I have little problems with his camera-work and the shooting style is vibrant, but it's clear that this is his debut and it's one he fails to get a grasp of. Maybe he was trying to be too ambitious by going straight for such a story first time round, I'm not too sure.<br/><br/>The film ends with a twist that is so nonsensical on a grand scale that I can't help but feel angered that I sat through the entire thing. All of that for such a lousy payoff. What is key to note is that there is no substance to anything. It is a very basic mystery wrapped up in a gimmick that will make people think it's doing something unique and propelled by characters that are as one-note as possible. It is borderline pretentious. It's almost like people think that because the narrative style is unique that the film must be exceptional. Well the main thing stopping that is that it's not remotely entertaining or interesting to watch. It doesn't matter how clever a film is, if it's a dull mess then it's a dull mess."

I believe that the intention of this film is just to mess with your mind, and that was not the sort entertainment that I was looking for when I watched it. Perhaps, at the end of the movie, they hoped I could have empathy with what it must be like to suffer from the memory condition that this guy has, so they tried to create an environment where my brain is turning itself inside out while trying to understand what's going on.

I found myself appreciating Mr. Nolan's directing more at home, and Mr. Pearce's performance stood out the second time around. What remained the same, however, was the complete lack of interest I had in the story. It seems Mr. Nolan was so pleased with the gimmick he had that there was little atttention paid to generating suspense and creating involving and/or compelling characters. There were moments at home when I was entertained by the film, but I was never fully interested in it.

","Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is hunting the man who killed his wife. He has to do this while struggling with short term memory loss meaning he relies on photos of important things and tattooing important facts on his body.<br/><br/>As everyone in the world knows the film runs backwards from the end for the majority - meaning that we, like Leonard see events without any knowledge of what has gone before. Like him we only have photos etc to help us. Unlike him we know what will happen and this makes it easier to follow the story. The film follows two streams - one where Leonard is telling someone over the phone about Sammy Jankis - a man who has the same memory condition. The second stream is the main narrative backwards.<br/><br/>This film is amazing. If the story was told forwards then there would be very little here but the devil is in the editing. This is a director's film - the key lies in the editing of scenes and the many visual tricks that provide clues to the conclusion of the film. The main compliant everyone has is that the ending leaves too many questions unanswered - however on the first viewing this is not true. The first time you see it the ending is simply and devastating - the twist is not as breath taking as Usual Suspects or Se7en but it will profoundly move you. When you get over this you begin to pick back over the plot and the ""Sammy Jankis"" section and you will find it difficult to come up with a water-tight solution. But to me that's one of the things to enjoy - the discussion with friends about the film and the fact that it stays with you for weeks after you've watched it.<br/><br/>Pearce is excellent in the lead, I cannot believe this guy once was in Neighbours! He is a totally believable character and makes the audience feel so many different things throughout. Joe Pantoliano is excellent - but then he always is. Even Carrie Anne Moss is good. The strength of Moss and Pantoliano is that we don't know who they are - are they Leonard's friends, enemies, good, bad? - and they play on this ignorance wonderfully.<br/><br/>The film is not in the top 250 because of the story but because of the editing. This is so different from anything else recently that it blows you away. It takes 15 minutes to get going but once you're in then you're in. This is worth watching as it shows how even a simple story can have a huge impact."

","'Memento' is simply overrated due to its overly complex plot and non-linear structure. While I certainly love films that have depth in them, with multiple possible interpretations, and unconventional structures, 'Memento' was far too excessive for its own good. While it had the potential to be a fantastic film, Christopher Nolan ultimately made this film too complicated to be enjoyed. I kept telling myself that the highly-anticipated plot twist in the end will make the rest of film make sense, and thus become a great film, but I was extremely let down by the climax, as there simply isn't one. The ""reveal"" is never really stated to be true, and it's deliberately up to the audience to decide whether there even was a plot twist which I personally think spoils the entire film. But it's really in the structure of the film that ruins it, by being non-linear to a ridiculous extent. Just when one thinks the film is going somewhere, the scene abruptly ends with another scene beginning and it becomes tiresome after the first half hour. Guy Pearce's acting was also nothing special and didn't stand out. If anything, it was Joe Pantoliano who was the acting highlight. The best aspect of this film was the score by David Julyan, which was highly emotive and rather beautiful."

Now when I see it, I am just wondering how come that it has occupied place in top 250 IMDb rating. May be that I like movies with straight forward story that is gripping and its narration flowing smoothly. It is all as confusing and vague as the mind of the character played by Guy Pierce. It is simply hard to find what he(the lead) did first and what he did later. Whether he commits murder and drives away in car or first drives in and then murders or whether he commits the murder at all. It is taxing on the mind of the viewer to watch the narration going back and forth and it is really tough to keep track of the story line. Many of movies of this director demand certain level of IQ from the viewers to get to his style of narrative.

"Maciste_Brother","6","5","8","22 February 2002"," Haunting narrative structure! Nothing more.
","Memento is fairly ordinary. Nothing earth-shattering about it. The slight story boils down to a man being manipulated left and right because of his disability: short-term memory loss. The tattoo idea is hard to swallow and there's a big storyline goof in the film: during the B&W scenes, when Guy Pearce relates the story about a another couple, with the husband suffering from short term memory lost, I thought, ""Now, what are the chances of having two men suffering from STML in one movie?"" I thought about this during the first part of the movie and pretty much figured out that what was going to happen in the remainder of the film. Memento only has three main characters. So seeing the old couple in the B&W flashbacks dramatically reinforced the fact that few real people populated the landscape. And with the main character acting from a disability and revenge (when the main character of a story seeks revenge, it's always misguided revenge) the other two characters (natalie and the cop) manipulating Guy, well, there aren't that many likeable people around to care for. All of this could have been saved if the performances had been great but alas they're simply okay. Nothing spectacular.<br/><br/>There's very little emotional core to this movie, no gravity. The scenes occurred one right after the other, with none of them being more memorable than the next. Memento has a seamless blandness to it when riveting scenes and stylized action was in order. Hitchcock would have done so much more with this story: likeable or interesting characters, for starters. And loads of stylized filmmaking this film was in desperate need of.<br/><br/>But if there's one aspect where Memento succeeds is how it lingers in the mind. Its ultimate creation is that of a totally distorted world, and in the end, seems to be what the director wanted to achieve. You might not enjoy Memento while watching it. You might even find it trite and convoluted. But like its main character, you'll be left with fragments of images and distorted time frame weeks after you've seen it. Memento is much better when one thinks about it afterwards than while watching it."

This characteristic is the very foundation of the film because we as the audience follow Lenny from start to finish, we know everything he knows, we learn everything he learns. However just as we learn everything Lenny does, Lenny is unable to remember the new information which adds good layer of intrigue and mystery as to how the film will end.<br/><br/>The narrative as I've mentioned before is non-linear, the events as we see them are not chronological for the most part. The only scenes that actually run in chronological order are the series of black and white scenes that incorporate flashbacks providing additional plot points. The scenes in colour play backward in contrast to the black and white scenes in what Christopher Nolan (the director) describes as a hairpin narrative where the narrative loops on itself and the true end point lies around the middle of the story.<br/><br/>As my summary suggests Memento had me confused for the large majority of the run time, what with the unconventional narrative structure and the slight frustration I felt as Lenny's memory issues proved to be his greatest weakness amidst everything and everyone around him. However the overall mystery of the film kept me engaged from start to finish, although the conclusion may leave some (as it did with me) with an anti-climactic feeling due to how Memento resolves its plot threads. Despite this Memento is still gripping from start to end and I'd highly recommend checking it out, especially for those interested in more unconventional and experimental storytelling."

The bulk of the film alternates from colour to black and white scenes, which then converge at the end of the film leading us to the beginning of the proceeding scene. Nolan uses the black and white scenes to represent the past; whilst including other material, such as flashbacks, that precedes the beginning of the black and white scenes- observed as Leonard's long term memory. However, just like the protagonist, us as the audience do not know the exact length of time those memories occurred- thus creating the ""most interesting ambiguity of the film"" (Christopher Nolan). <br/><br/>As one of the highest grossing directors in history, Nolan is able to create an unusual yet captivating masterpiece, which continues to be admired and loved seventeen years later."

","Surprise endings don't excuse complicated, explanatory meanderings.  The story is much more shrewd than the film makes it out to be -- things are still falling into place long after the credits have stopped rolling.<br/><br/>Kind of slow, forcing you to give it a chance, since we presume to know the rest.  Through all the billowing sequences and finally settling for some lucid crime/detective/drug theme, at the end the surprises pop out and BOOM credits roll, but only after a very cocky, humorous Guy Pearce says with the utmost pretension ""Now, where was I?""  You can almost hear the filmmakers sneering into your ear ""Aren't we just so goddamn clever?""<br/><br/>Yeah, you were clever...but not much else.<br/><br/>5 Fight Club insinuations out of 10."

No I did not get the ending before the end reel but by that time I didn't care, it had turned into a matter of wills, which would break first my will to watch the film or my will to say to a friend that this was the most boring piece of s*** I have seen in ages and could he please turn it off.  The former won, but I felt tha I had wasted two hours of my life which I cannot now get back. If you want a film with a good plot twist watch The Usual Suspects, if you want to watch a film and then be able to say well I'm a real fan watch Memento.

","If you are a studious fan of film and film history, this movie is nothing but a curio destined for a dusty shelf.  Maybe the project started as a handful of good ideas, but the result will be as short lived as short term memory (assuming you have such).  <br/><br/>It's nifty occasionally, but mostly vapid and pointless. With a style that wears as tedious as the suit the main character wears over and over, the story is mundane with acting stilted and amateurish.<br/><br/>This is 21st century Hollywood Hokum with no subtlety, amusement, suspense or real viewing satisfaction.  Not only is it not the 10th best film ever, it is not the 1000th best."

","It's not until a film like Memento comes along, or that you personally have to deal with someone close who suffers a form of this subject to hand, that you get jolted to remember just how your memory is such a prized and treasured thing - and crucially that it's one of your key safety devices.<br/><br/>Christopher and Jonathan Nolan crafted one of the best films of 2000 based on those facets of the human condition. Their protagonist is Leonard Shelby, played with stupendous believability by Guy Pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. He can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can't form a memory. So who can he trust? Does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? He tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan plants the audience right into Leonard's world. By using a reverse story telling structure it's deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! It has been argued that it's trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it's all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. Mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in Leonard's life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. And the Nolan's know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself!<br/><br/>The reverse structure wasn't new in 2000, but Christopher Nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as David Julyan's musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it's a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway. Super. 9/10"
"colinsbob","4","4","6","1 November 2008"," I've got it, I've got it Heck, I've got it.
","Since I've started watching and reviewing movies, I was searching for innovation and fantastically. What then happened, it proved actually that my theory about British directors have stile, been wrong. That was when I saw Memento At first, I found it unusual that the film begins extremely violent, do even the most controversial films ever made, like Cannibal Holocaust, or (what's more possible that this film is a copy of that movie) Pulp Fiction, don't begin by killing people, by showing how they die. Its true that's a shock for the audience and that they will stay to see the movie, but the next move, was so unprofessional, like he did never get a video camera in his hands. He broke the main rule, of every filmmaker that ever broke a rule. He tortured the audience by showing too many flashbacks. The rule, of every film is not to do a same thing more then 3 times or 7 times but not at once. Even if you look at Pulp fiction, it's got not less then 7, yeah, seven my friends, seven! Memento's got 22 jumps. A man, a normal human, looses every wish to see a thing if you have repeated something more then 11 times. I'm somehow surprised that it became a success. I have nothing against the actors, because Nolan chooses quite well actors. What I'm really mad, are the characters In every Nolan movie! The characters are mean, evil, stupid I mean, you don't have to think in Nolan's movies, they tell you anything at the end, so you have to just watch the end, cause anything else it for throwing away: the horrible music, poor characters and no style directing, only some trademarks, but nothing else. But let's go back to Memento You may have notice that the characters are changing, but from good up to evil. This lends realism, that's for sure, but it does not automatically made a great feature. Some of you would probably say that a man gets rotten, because the society wont help him with his problem, but that's not the case in Memento. Leo's the guy who actually killed the only person, who was ever kind to him, and understood his problem, Teddy, what makes Leonard a guy, who doesn't want any help from anyone which turns his character not into a anti hero, but more a antagonist: he has no purpose, he doesn't want any help, he loves nobody a villain. Finally, some of you might think that I'm only writhing bad reviews all the time, but true's that I love much worse movies and writhe reviews that show how charming films are. I even see something positive in Michael Bays films, but this film doesn't have a place at IMDb top 250.<br/><br/>I'll give this film a rating 5.6 out-ha 10.0, cause I still think that the idea to have a whole film going backwards nice. As well the actors are pretty good, and its not easy to forget such a film, but its nothing special or innovative. Its mean, evil, not well directed and overrated"

","I didn't have too much trouble following this film after the first ten minutes - maybe because I'm a touch dyslexic, and I'd seen the backward Seinfeld wedding-in-India episode several times. It was ingenious that while the central character had his puzzle to figure out, we as an audience were given one that paralleled his.<br/><br/>But the further Memento progressed, the more I felt that I neither liked nor related to any of the characters, who become more one-dimensional the further back in time we encounter them, and that then becomes who they really are. It's not a film I would have cared to see had it been chronological.<br/><br/>Take Groundhog Day, make it the others in the film who know what's going on, then change it from a comedy to a moody thriller with a bunch of sleazeballs, and you have Memento. It gives the impression not only that nothing is as it seems, but that no one can be trusted, and everyone is parasitic when given the opportunity. It's sad that so many people have praised it, given it's jaundiced view of humanity.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a milestone, a new Third Man for the new century. I recommend it only as a study in film-making and storytelling. You may smile at the tricks in the unfolding of the magic. But if you have the simple desire to see real, complex characters -- with both good sides and human failings -- they won't turn up in Memento.<br/><br/>By the end - or beginning, as it were -- the completion of the puzzle only creates an ugly, slimy picture. It's like watching the magician pull a dead rabbit from his hat. At a different time in my life, I'd have been a lot more impressed."

","Perhaps because this movie was rated SO HIGHLY, my viewing was tainted by unrealistically bolstered expectations. Maybe...<br/><br/>There was a strange twist of irony at work here: the more I watched this film the less I liked it. What began as a wonderfully, refreshing look at (reverse) story-telling, became less entertaining and more tedious with each passing (and re-passing) flash-back (or is that flash-forward?)<br/><br/>Part of this film played like an old Twilight Zone episode I recall seeing many years ago. And that's not a bad thing. I enjoyed piecing together the ""why"" of the plot, since we already knew the ""what."" However, generally uninteresting and unappealing characters mar the performances, and while our hero may be unaware of time, as a viewer I was painfully aware of how his film seemed to drag, lacking a good sense of timing. As for the ending, it too could have been given the same delicious touches as the beginning sequence, but alas, it does nothing to reward the viewer for having endured the bulk of the film.<br/><br/>One reviewer commented how well this HIGHLY RATED film will hold up in another few years when compared to the classics. Others have asked how on earth it could have rated so high to begin with. The former will be answered on its own, and I believe time will not be too kind. The answer to the latter is akin to the McDonald's Syndrome: Those who grew up eating Big Macs on a regular basis erroneously come to believe it's actually good food. Perhaps compared to what Hollywood is offering these days, Memento is indeed gourmet fare. To me, it's still just a hamburger. (6 out of 10)."

That being said, I didn't enjoy watching this movie. After being interested for about the first 5 minutes, I lapsed into waiting for the story to progress. It never did. I don't see how anyone could pull off this type of ""pacing"" any better than Momento, the problem is I don't see how the pacing of this story can be good either. It's not the fault of anyone involved, I just couldn't stand constantly receiving the same information over and over. I already know this, I don't care that the main character does not. It could not have been put together any better than it was, but it just kept frustrating me over and over.

"Infofreak","Null","7","13","25 March 2003"," Fanboys and hardened movie buffs agree - this is something special!
","Every few years a movie comes along that internet nerd fanboys and hardened movie buffs alike agree is something special. 'Memento' is one of those movies. The first time I watched it in a cinema I was blown away. Subsequent viewings (I'm probably up to my fourth) take a little bit of the shine off it and the essential gimmickiness of it become more obvious. It also becomes apparent that Shelby's memory disorder is a bit too contrived and only seems to kick in (or not) at the most dramatically convenient moments. Some closer scrutiny will see the whole thing quickly fall apart. Still, there's no real point in being too picky with this movie. If you accept the premise at face value you are guaranteed a fascinating and involving film experience. Australian soap actor Guy Pearce ('Ravenous') is brilliant as Shelby, easily the best role of his career to date. The ""backwards"" story telling of the movie (nicked most likely off Harold Pinter) was much talked about but it is Pearce's performance which really sells it. Joe Pantoliano ('The Sopranos') has too often been stuck in b-grade movies, so it's really good to see him given a more rewarding part. He seems to relish it and his chemistry with Pearce is really enjoyable. Likewise with Pantoliano's co-star in 'The Matrix' Carrie-Ann Moss. Moss can really act, and I hope this leads on to some substantial work for her in the future.  The underrated character actor Steven Tobolowsky ('Thelma And Louise') is also excellent in the important supporting role of Sammy Jankis, and a couple of actors I really like Mark Boone, Jr ('Trees Lounge') and Callum Keith Rennie ('Hard Core Logo') are both worth keeping an eye out for along the way. The hype surrounding 'Memento' may put many people off, but that would be a real shame as it just about lives up to it, and it's a very, very good movie. Highly recommended."

","You know that IMDb Top 250 is always discussed, the overrated movies, the underrated movies, the movies which should be in the list, the movies which should not be in the list etc. I believe that movies like Memento causes a problem. The ratings of some other movies lose their meaning. They cause some other movies lose their worth. Memento has one of the most smart, brilliant and complicated scripts of all time and also the story editing of the film is the same, it must be very hard to make, as known, the story begins from the end and retrogresses, in terms of direction, it is well, but no more than that, so a good movie, a good crime thriller. The tone of the movie is 'independentish'. I don't say this in a good way or in a bad way, but it just looked me interesting. Even if I could not understand it exactly, there is also a twist at the end. I recently saw The Machinist which I can call Christian Bale's Memento, it was a pretty good movie, but there were plot holes, but there is not in Memento, so I appreciate the effort, but it is neither one of my favorite movies nor a great movie. If its rating had been 7.7 or let's say 8.0, it would have been welcome. Probably it is because the script was brilliant, I agree, but as a movie, generally 8.6 is extremely over."

","I saw this film after hearing all the hype while on my last trip back to the States. It turns out that it's much ado about nothing.<br/><br/> I was not impressed. In fact, I was almost depressed that something so evidently sub-par was being touted as nothing short of a revelation.<br/><br/>So what if the film has an unusual non-linear narrative structure??? So what if it's stylish, hip and has great cinematography? I don't care for the characters one bit! They're pure cardboard, impossible to relate to, sketchy at best - even Guy Pearce's character. They exist solely as pegs for a context which is not all that interesting in and of itself - in fact, it's downright pedestrian. A guy's wife is raped and killed and he goes after the killer when he wakes up - how many times has that one been used? The whole thing is contrived and stinks of an exercise - it's just soulless mental masturbation, and anyone getting off on it is really selling themselves short!<br/><br/> Even the much-talked about backwards narrative structure isn't all that new. It's been done before in a film by David Hugh Jones called BETRAYAL, with Jeremy Irons, Patricia Hodge and Ben Kingsley. Even though the story is quite different from this film, BETRAYAL has everything this film lacks - strong characterizations and people that you actually care about. In BETRAYAL, you anxiously await the next flashback because you are genuinely concerned about the characters' fate. MEMENTO, with each flashback, just gets more and more annoying.<br/><br/> It WAS slightly intriguing to see Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss (refugees from THE MATRIX) in this together, as it is another play on ""What is really real?"" but this is hardly a benefit. However, I don't blame the actors one bit - they were just not given much to work with.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Guy Pearce IS someone to watch. It'd be interesting to see him and Brad Pitt together in a film - they'd be very believable as brothers."

If the story only works with radical cutting styles, then it's not much of a story, is it?

It's a highly exaggerated movie. The performances are also not that good either. When rating a movie, people should consider and compare it with other productions.<br/><br/>I mentioned about the ""last to first"" thing because it is really not a spoiler. You understand it at the beginning of the film. But I recommend those who have not seen the movie yet to skip this paragraph - The part which I hate the most is where Leonard ""the poor victim which suffers from memory loss"" suddenly turns out to be a man who can control his memories. It is contrary to the main theme of the movie. I think this is where the whole movie becomes senseless.<br/><br/>Memento is rated R for violence, language and some drug content but why doesn't it say that there is some nudity? There is a scene where Guy Pearce is nude and you can see his ass. If it was Carrie-Anne Moss's or Jorja Fox's ass, wouldn't it be different?<br/><br/>Normally I wouldn't give such a bad rating to Memento; I gave 1/10 due to its high rating which it definitely doesn't deserve.

","Fusing elements from such cool plot twisting films like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Fight Club"", ""Memento"" was a groundbreaking exercise in narrative presentation. <br/><br/>Leonard Shelby, a former insurance investigator turned vigilante avenger was hell bent on finding and killing the man who left him seriously injured and his wife, dead. But due to his aforesaid injury, this poor bloke now suffers from permanent brain damage with symptomatic short term amnesia(memory loss). Apart from whatever happened before his injury, our main man would not be able to remember whatever transpired beyond his last fifteen minutes. So how is a physically and emotionally damaged man gonna do what he set out to do? Oh, did I mention that this film begins with the end of the story and ends, at the beginning? Go figure.<br/><br/>Due to the film's reverse-chronological structure, the equally  paralysed audience shared the protagonist's compulsion to concentrate on any vital developments which may help unravel the mystery. This thus made the viewing experience highly participative. <br/><br/>Of course, there were more to this film than above gimmick, or it would not have sustained the audience's interest, nor explain their willingness to engage in such a cerebral exercise. <br/><br/>Apart from the occasional jokes on his mental handicap and the gradual unveiling of his investigative efforts, we also saw Leonard Shelby as a man, remembering his woman. Along the way, we witnessed his idiosyncratic attempts in dealing with his loss, in searching for a closure. Through these introspective scenes, we were offered a glimpse into the psyche of anyone who have lost people dear in their lives. <br/><br/>Such unexpected insights from an already inventive crime thriller, bring to fore Memento's true ambition. It does not want to be just a film with A Beautiful Mind(pun intended), but also one with A Beautiful Heart(ditto). To which I feel it almost succeeded in accomplishing. Keyword here is ""ALMOST"".<br/><br/>
Before any fanatic supporters of ""Memento"" out there decide to silence my lone dissent, allow me to acknowledge that being such a fiendishly innovative film, ""Memento"" deserves the feverish cult following it inspired.<br/><br/>
But I can only go so far in my praise as there is something missing. I will explain my position and more in the concluding ""Part 2"" of my commentary. Till then, watch this space."

My date convinced me to rent this, and I honestly regret every minute of it. If you are capable of rational, logical thought, you will find this story to be ridiculous.  Maybe that explains why so many people like it."

","Before I even caught a whiff of the insane hype over ""Memento"" I saw a little film from an unknown director called ""Following"". I was very impressed with the editing scheme and direction of this tight little noir and hoped the director would gain success. It's too bad that success had to come from ""Momento"". This too plays with the arrangement of scenes, but in so simple a fashion that getting the trick was no challenge. It isn't a bad film, really, but it's not great either. I don't recall having any complaints about the performances. But the story and the way it is presented are not all that interesting. The gimmick of seeing the scenes in reverse order and the little carry-over at the end of each one felt like a running gag that had gone sour. The film is a one trick pony that was lucky enough to snag everyone's attention. If people looked closer they'd know that the movie behind the hype is actually fairly thin and shallow. I'd really like to see Chris Nowlan have a hit with a really good picture. This one just isn't as good as ""Following"", but it is better than ""Insomnia""."
"Sammy2006","Null","6","12","4 August 2004"," Lenny doesn't have the condition
","Alright, I may not be an expert but my knowledge of this movie surpasses that of the common viewer.<br/><br/>First off i recommend you all, if you haven't already, read the short story it was based on titled ""Memento Mori"" written by Christopher's brother Jonathon Nolan.<br/><br/>Now for starters i do not believe that Lenny has the ""condition."" I believe that it is mental not physical. My reasoning behind this is that there were many instances where he DID remember things. Throughout the whole movie he would catch glances of his tattoos and have no idea what they were, he would roll up his sleeve, or take off his shirt to investigate, but as he was taking down Teddy's license plate number not only did he remember that he normally gets tattoos but he also remembered what number fact he was on. ALso in the same instance he writes down the 1 and the i exactly the same way, he gets it tattooed exactly the same way, but whenever he read it out loud he differentiated between the two. How could he do this without memory?<br/><br/>Most of the movie will drive you insane to try to figure out, i speak from experience, but the director himself said that there was a logical explanation, unfortunately i don't think we can ever be sure whether we are right or not.<br/><br/>This is my all time favorite movie, so if you have not seen it please do."

He developed this condition after suffering a TBI the night he and his wife were attacked in their home. This is the same night he ""thinks"" his wife was killed. He must put tattoos all over his body and gather every clue he can to find ""the killer"".<br/><br/>Truly a classic in the suspense and mystery categories.

Instead of trying to tell a story, the film jumps around with time which can be confusing unless you're paying close attention. I actually thought it was a clever way to go, but they just overdid it to death. By the time it was over, I didn't much care about the plot twist at the end. The jumping around made it less interesting to me.<br/><br/>Overall, it was OK I guess, but it lacked something. This was a good idea that could have been a great movie, but it was fumbled.

","The plot is extremely straightforward when watched in sequence. The scenes are not in chronological order, but it is easy to piece it together. This movie is impressive in that it is really a case study about memories and how we shape our lives based on our memories. Some people take advantage of it, some use it to define who they are, while some totally disregard regard it and try to stick with the facts/written word. The  main character incorporates all these facets into his life at one point or the other, and the movie shows that no one facet defines who you truly are.<br/><br/>
What IS complicated in the movie is determining what is fact and what the main character thinks has happened or what he has conditioned himself to think occured in the past. Therein lies the complexity of the movie, and there are several clues thrown in throughout the movie, very subtle but indicative clues.<br/><br/>The movie does require at least a second viewing to capture the points the director is trying to make."

"MartinHafer","7","10","25","7 December 2006"," Intriguing idea--but #26 on IMDb??!?!?!?!
","Huh? Talk about an unreliable score for a film! Unfortunately, IMDb is very, very, very skewed by recent movies. So many older great films have very few reviews or have generally lower scores--not because they are worse than newer films, but because there is a bias against older films because SOME reviewers are teens or people who simply won't consider anything that was not made in the last decade or so. Likewise, there is often a strong bias only for Hollywood blockbusters, even though many foreign or ""small"" films deserve recognition but are ignored because people just refuse to try something outside their comfort zone. This is a real shame, as there is just so much more out there. While MEMENTO is a decent and very unconventional film (I sure respect them for trying something DIFFERENT), it isn't great when viewed in context.<br/><br/>Okay, so you may think I am just some crazy crank who is totally negative! Well, this might be true (the verdict is still out), but of the IMDb top 250, over 30% were made just in the last two decades. Also, films like THE WALLACE AND GROMIT movie, MAGNOLIA, FINDING NEVERLAND and V FOR VENDETTA make the top 250 and yet films like MARTY, THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US, SHOW PEOPLE, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, BANSHUN, THE CAINE MUTINY, CAPTAIN BLOOD, MY MOTHER'S CASTLE, CHARIOTS OF FIRE, DINNER AT EIGHT, DODSWORTH and ELMER GANTRY don't make this list (among others). It's sort of the like the expression ""out of sight, out of mind""--if a film isn't recent or make a ton of dough at the box office, it's chances of making the list are very low indeed.<br/><br/>Okay, enough of my rant--now on to this movie. MEMENTO is a very strange movie in that the film starts at the very end and works its way backwards towards the beginning. This is an intriguing and clever idea. You know that the main character who was brain injured committed a murder, but because his injury makes it physically impossible for him to remember any events AFTER his injury, he tries to solve a mystery by leaving notes for himself and tattooing himself so he can eventually put all the pieces together. The problem is that after a while, the very stylish film becomes awfully tedious. Plus, the ending, to me, just wasn't very satisfying--it's an ending you will either love or hate. Leonard Maltin gave the film only 1 1/2 stars out of 4. I won't be THAT critical, but I just can't see how stylish film making and an odd plot result in this movie being elevated to near the top of the IMDb list of films!!<br/><br/>NOTE TO PARENTS--the ""f-word"" is used about 200 times in the film and there is some intense violence, so this film is rated R. I watched it with my 16 year-old, but you might want to think twice about letting the kids see this one."

In fact I was bored for the rest of the movie, it was not suspenseful and not thrilling. The good things that this movie did have going for it was excellent directing and a slightly confusing turn of events from one scene to the next, but again after the first 30 minutes it became very predictable. It was pretty unique, though i have seen a few movies that begin with the end first and work backwards.

","My take, omg i don't know wtf this movies about. It lost me at the end. What if teddy ended up being the murderer and like the guy he was chasing the cop. May be solve the problem with the non-sequential themes. Harder to read then a frank miller comic book without the rest of the series imho.<br/><br/>These are one of those movies that could be good, if they do it right. Is there a book or guide to this movie? The reason why it failed is because in my book the characters got all mixed up. They lost coordination on how to make the movie interesting. If you were to watch 12 monkeys, it would be interesting because the key points, if you watch pulp fiction it would be interesting. This movie would be an interesting comic orientated mobster movie thriller full of suspense or thought provoking if they didn't add sooo many characters. Jesus, who is the guy at the end?!? Why isn't Teddy the killer? I figured the doctor was in his position as an amnesiac, okay. But umm did he just fly into France from Hollywood is my question. The movie is way too thought provoking with too many characters, and some people don't have the time to watch a guy try and remember something until the quarter end of the movie where it takes a back seat in interest. Its as if the user is tricked into actually liking the movie. Horrible. TBH no one would care about a throw in character who is suddenly the killer of his wife, who is now....alive. Whom he kills cus hes an idiot. Okay. Maybe they grew old together. Makes sense, except it would be more interesting if i knew his wife was diabetic, and he kills his wife while in the hospital after the accident. Maybe he could have killed his wife, or maybe he could have had like a son or daughter instead whom he killed. Maybe his wife should have survived and his daughter was the unfortunate casualty. Maybe he went to the town of his killer and made friends with the residence, true...okay but then his killer shows up and the guy he was chasing or chasing him is out of the picture. I would expect even, teddy to actually be lying, while the guy he was chasing be a cop. Sure, throw in the obvious...but what if teddy had a motive to kill him at the end. What if teddy was insured and had him kill the cop, whom he finally realized he killed. What if Teddy was the 'second' guy. Maybe cripple his mind a little psychologically. Was the movie trying to be like funny or something? I don't think so. I like the mood of the film though, it was very light so they went in that direction but i would like to see a light funny comedy thriller with dark humor, very artsy makes you feel really small in a big world. Except this comedy thriller needs murder, it just does..and lots of it. Good idea, not so good outcome. What exactly were they trying to do here is my question. Need's work."

"tburke85","8","3","5","8 June 2009"," Memento Much Better Than Anticipated
","Memento was a much better film than anticipated from acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan the man behind films like The Prestige, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and last years blockbuster hit The Dark Knight which was my favorite movie of 2008. In Memento Nolan really establishes himself as an extremely talented filmmaker. Memento has an intricate but not too complicated story and the way the movie plays out with the ending in the beginning and the beginning at the end makes it feel different (in a good way) and original. Its one of those films to watch a couple times to fully understand what it was all about and so that you can pick up on little things you didn't notice the first time around. The surprises in store for anyone who hasn't seen it I wasn't quite expecting myself which made the film very enjoyable to watch at least to me. The three leads in the movie are admirable in their roles including Guy Pearce as Leonard a man with a rare brain disorder after an accident who can't form new memories. Pearce's Leonard is after the one who raped and killed his wife a man's identity he can never know for sure. Pearce is believable in the role and does a great job as the main character. Carrie Anne-Moss does a decent job as Natalie an ally to Leonard who helps in his quest to find his wife's killer but may not be who she appears. Moss is quite good at playing a character you're not sure is trying to help Leonard or just using him. The same can go for Joe Pantoliano whose equally impressive as Teddy a man Leonard isn't sure whether he can fully trust. The rest of the relatively unknown cast also turn in solid performances. The ending is fitting which reveals some secrets while keeping other questions unanswered but that doesn't hurt the movie. Overall Memento was much better than expected because of it's interesting revenge story, complex characters played by talented actors, and surprising plot twists that make for an above average entertaining thriller to watch."
"Jacques98","2","3","5","6 December 2008"," Just throw the doughnut away.
","Let me get it out of the way and say that I am a thriller buff. I'm not one of the countless reviewers on this site who watched Memento and didn't understand itI understood the plot perfectlyand I am certainly not one of the countless reviewers who gave this a negative score because they see it as poor cinema. I don't have a pretentious bone in my body.<br/><br/>I am writing a negative review of Memento solely because it's exactly like everything I've seen before, and that's something not many people complain about.<br/><br/>The main problem I have with the thriller genre is that it repeats itself, in the same way the sci-fi genre repeats itself. When thriller films don't outright copy one another, they always seem to think if they can find some new, original plot they're going to be groundbreaking. The only problem with that last statement is that most thrillers with ""new, original"" plot-lines still simply have the exact same things happening on screen as all the others. The whole wife-is-murdered-I-must-avenger-her plot. Car chases. People talking about the plot. Intense confirmation between bad guy and good guy. You know the drill.<br/><br/>While Memento tries very hard to avoid those obvious things, and in the end it somewhat does, it's still nothing you haven't seen before. It plays out exactly like every other thrilleravenge-wife, gather info, kill guy who did itand ends exactly like every other thrillerreversal of expectations. Some of the plot details may be a bit fresh, but when you see the same things that you've seen in every other thriller, who really cares? Memento uses the common mistake thriller writers and directors both make: watching a whole typical movie just to get to the less-typical ending is just boring and forgettable. There is no entertainment value in it. It's the same exact mistake The Usual Suspects made. It's like trying to force yourself to eat a stale long john doughnut just to get to the cream filling. You'll end up throwing the doughnut away.<br/><br/>So how great is this ""awesome, unbelievable"" plot twist? Pretty average. It's a plot twist, sure, but with such a pathetic main plot, once again, who really cares they made it a little less pathetic in the last ten minutes? It's still the generic man-must-avenge-wife story.<br/><br/>How was the directing? Once again, pretty typical. It just takes some elements of metafiction and puts them on filmso what? Also, the use of black-and-white intertwined is just getting downright cliché, being that most every film with ""amazing directing"" (big emphasis on the quotes) uses it. I will give Christopher Nolan a bit of credit, because he does keep Memento a bit more fast-paced than most thrillers I've seen, but that's about as far as I can say. It still certainly isn't thrilling, and I find that ironic.<br/><br/>So what it comes down to is this. If you're a hardcore thriller buff like myself, this is essential for you to see, but that doesn't mean you'll enjoy it. If you're an average movie watcher who just wants something entertaining and smart, look elsewhere. Fast.<br/><br/>2/10"
"Cedric_Catsuits","5","3","5","23 May 2006"," Prepare to be confused
","Anyone who says they understand this film after one, or even two viewings, is lying! I don't think either Nolan or Pearce fully understand it - indeed I suspect there's a deliberate intent to confuse! Personally i think it is trying to be a bit too clever, and it doesn't quite succeed in achieving what it sets out to (unless that was purely confusion!) The first hour is so slow and bewildering I found myself starting to pick holes in the plot and continuity, of which there are a great many. Shot over 25 days and with little room for error, I guess the faults are understandable. The problem is the story doesn't hold your attention long enough to mask them.<br/><br/>I suspect after a second viewing I may feel more comfortable with it, but I shall need a long time to recover from the numbness caused by the brain-scrambling complexity of this story. I'm tempted to describe it as pretentious, but I don't think that's entirely fair. Yes it's trying to be clever, but I don't think it's trying to deceive. Nolan is a fairly inexperienced director and I think he has much to offer, so I'm going to cut him some slack. Maybe he bit off more than he could chew with Memento, but you can't accuse him of being boring. I shall certainly be paying close attention to his future projects, as well as trying to unearth some of his early stuff.<br/><br/>I think this movie should come with an instruction manual, but failing that perhaps it would be better to get the DVD and watch the interview before the movie. I don't think it will spoil it, and may ease some of the pain. Unfortunately I think it's appeal will be severely limited, and many people will - understandably - be irritated by it. It needs working at, which perhaps isn't what movies are about. After all, this is supposed to be the entertainment industry. If you understand and accept that this film is not light entertainment, and will leave you with more questions than answers, then you must watch it. <br/><br/>If nothing else it inspires great debate, which is a good sign for the industry as a whole. I will simply sum it up as flawed, but fascinating."

That being said, just because it was different doesn't mean it was good. I found the film boring and repetitive to the point where I became disinterested. I would not recommend viewing this film unless you are looking for something different. But remember, different isn't always good.<br/><br/>My rating : @ 1/2 (out of five)"

","Dear Christopher Nolan:<br/><br/>You´re not very famous here, in Spain. I´ve never heard nothing about you and your films. You were a completely strange for me. No cinema shows your ""Memento"" in Granada (I think a cinema in Madrid and another in Barcelona did it).<br/><br/>I was a happy man until I saw Memento. One of my friends, in one of this crazy nights at home, recommends us to hire Memento at the video. We were surprised, we only want to have a nice time and have a laughs watching one of these stupid teenagers films. Finally, we accepted and took memento at the videoclub.<br/><br/>Since the first second, with that marvelous start (I can´t remember such one in other films) we felt very atracted by the film. The running of the story, the splendid direction of the film. Nothing is out. Everything has his explanation. That ending...<br/><br/>Some of my friends said that he understood nothing. I laughed. ""You are silly"", I cry to him. I thought I had understood everything. Then I watched the film again, and I was confused. ""Did I understand everything?"". I watched it again and again.

","Memento is a film recieving great praise for being a new and highly original idea. While it is original, that doesn't make it a good movie, nor does it make it any fun to sit through. The movie stars Guy Pearce as a man who is looking for the thug who killed is wife. The problem is, he has no short term memory, and has no idea of who his allies are and who is trying to manipulate him. The story is told backwards, with the film beginning at the end, and ending at the start. Unfortunately the novelty wears off after about ten minutes and the film becomes excruciating to sit through, and soon the characters become boring and the plot uninvolving.<br/><br/>
Memento reeks of a script that tries too hard to be fresh and original. I must commend this film for avoiding cliche and formula, but at the same time I criticize it for being overly complicated and pretentious when it should have been entertaining. The final word is: Memento is a bust; don't believe the hype."

Some reviews here have mentioned good characterizations, yet I think that despite very good efforts by the performers, there was no room for character development because of the very limits the movie imposes on itself. Its greatest achievement is in leading the audience to believe that what Leonard knows - what Leonard holds as ""certainties"" - are all true.<br/><br/>MEMENTO is good, and worth seeing.

I'm not a stupid person, but I can't imagine anyone with an IQ of only 100 being able to figure out what's going on and therefore to enjoy it.  (I'm sure the viewers who gave it a ""10"" will be duly flattered.) By the time the movie ends, you have a wonderful idea of what it must be like to lack short-term memory -- the director and editor did an outstanding job here -- but as a viewer you are still owed a denouement, and what you get isn't complete; there are yet a few unresolved facts that gnaw at you. Furthermore, the plot is grisly.  A person with the protagonist's problem could be pursuing an entirely different quest.  Which gets me to the last point:  the scenes of violence were more gratuitous than necessary; they didn't strengthen the plot.

"Mighty_sheman","4","4","8","3 June 2005"," Mediocrity Gone Mad! Yet another cynical and senseless byproduct of this wonderful era of cinema.
","*Tiny unspoilers within*<br/><br/>No, it's not a dig aimed at the formerly great MGM, I talk of Memento. Intelligent film making? Perhaps. An intelligent film? I think not! In this post Tarantino age of cinema this is what passes for a masterpiece, god help us! It was Tarantino's Pulp Fiction that sparked this brave new age of cinema we are currently suffering, the age of mediocre is the new good. It is so fitting that the so called benchmark for film making in the 21st century should be the personification of style over substance. In fact there is hardly anything worth extracting from this self congratulatory thriller other than the over stylized imagery and technical wizardry on show. This film is stone cold, a lifeless film made purely for your aesthetic pleasure.<br/><br/>The premise for the film IS intriguing, the director provided himself remarkable scope in which to create a fantastically gripping thriller by virtue of the protagonist's 'condition' combined with a muddled take on the old reverse narrative. This allowed him the chance to chop up the plot and deliver the punch line from each segment first then show us the events leading up to that point. This is fascinating the first couple of times, but by the 4th I was thinking ""wow, that's getting old fast"" by the 8th time I just wanted the punishment to stop. The narrative device is purely and simply a clever gimmick, and one that is clearly wasted on such a banal story. The argument has been used that the connect the dots narrative structure is the only thing that makes it intriguing. Heck, so what? It is possible to take a half decent plot and spin gold from straw with the right narrative structure. Not here though, even told in reverse it had no worth in my eyes because the plot is beyond redemption. A thriller should be thrilling, this film is snail paced and instead of being intriguing the narrative structure quickly begins to resemble someone desperately trying to draw blood from a stone, futile. Further more a thriller or drama should have interesting characters and a bit of intrigue. The plot was not captivating, the situation was not captivating, the characters were not captivating and I did not care about them, especially not Lenny and his questionable motives.<br/><br/>There is not one good character in this film, not surprising since the actors don't have any challenging dialog to work with. Also they look like they were sleepwalking through filming, only Pantoliano attempts to bring anything resembling life to this turkey. I can almost forgive Pearce as he is playing a vengeful, obsessive psycho, and he has no short term memory so he might well have zero personality or emotion for good reason. However Moss' character is simply a horrible film noir clichÃ©, the femme fetale, and she performs the role with no style whatsoever, perhaps because she has little work with. All she is required to do is look moody and menacing and be a bitch. Please, can nobody come up with good characters these days? The effect is not good at all, I felt these characters and the swiss cheese style excuse for a thriller/drama were spat out as the appendix for a Nolan master class in technical magic and whiz bang editing. The cast are rendered pointless by a senseless plot that only exists to be manipulated and rearranged to display the fact you can take a terrible story, mix it up beyond recognition and somehow disguise it as some sort of epiphany, a la Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Then the ending (sorry beginning?) was just the icing on this grotesquely elaborate cake, I don't want to totally spoil it for those who have not seen it as the surprise of having your head deflated in disappointment is one not to be spoiled. It's suffice to say the preceding events were rendered even more senseless by the anticlimactic conclusion, I had not seen an ending this whiffy since Fight Club (later bettered by Mulholland Drive). I was left apathetic and cold by the conclusion to this 'riddle' that seemingly offered two possibilities, neither of which would validate the rest of the miserable excuse for a film. Why? Because I didn't care! Memento (and it's message) is like ouroboros in the most literal sense - circular, self contained, endless and ultimately pointless. Forgive my apparent artistic blindness, I DO appreciate creativity and inventiveness, my message to Mr Nolan and his peers would be ""please use it to INVENT a decent story!"" <br/><br/>In reflection, perhaps the most annoying thing isn't that Memento is so mediocre in every way, it's the fact that it has been so widely regarded as a great film, much like the two putrid films that it rooted from - Fight Club and Pulp Fiction. I don't know, my friends say I am a cynic and the harshest of harsh critics, well I simply say I am just reflecting on a harsh and cynical world that thrives on misery and depression like they are going out of fashion. With the rapid development of special effects, filming equipment and creativity in cinema it's easy to look back on the 'golden eras' of cinema and chuckle at the technical integrity and naive world view of some of the oldies. However it almost makes me want to shed a tear that cinema has come such a long way technically but sadly seems to have lost the values that used to be at it's heart. Films used to tell stories, they used to have REAL characters and had soul and substance. Now I look at the 'classics' of todays material world - films like Pulp Fiction, Memento, American Beauty and Fight Club and I see nothing but hate, cynicism, sharp emotionless dialog, 2 dimensional characters and most importantly style over everything else, a sad but accurate reflection of the age we live in? Indeed."

"dark-10","1","9","24","16 May 2001"," Overrated, but still Good.
","All in all, this was a good movie. It used TWO gimmicks that have already been used. The first: Starting at the end of a story to find out what happened in the beginning, was used in a Seinfeld episode (and much more effectively may I add). The second: The hero's inability to create new memories, due to short term memory loss, which was used by Dana Carvey in Clean Slate. Having said that, I think, like several movies which have had a gimmick to their story or format, that Nolan took the easy way out at the end, knowing people would overlook it due to it's gimmick. Like the Goofs section pointed out, Leonard wouldn't be able to remember he had the condition of memory loss. Even in Clean Slate, the story made a point to remind the main character he had this ""condition"" every time he woke up. And that wasn't written nearly as good as this.  An obvious oversight by the writer/director. Also (I think another user comment mentioned this and I'm surprised more people haven't), Leonard has tatoos on his body BEFORE his wife dies. Including the one that tells him his wife is dead! I dunno if this was intended, but if it was, it goes unexplained.<br/><br/>Ever since the Usual Suspects waxed The Third Man, filmmakers have had this thing with hiding one's ""identity"". Well, honestly, for me the only time I was fooled was in the Usual Suspects. I saw it coming in Fight Club and The Sixth Sense (though in this film it didn't ruin a thing for me), and I saw it coming in Memento. I gotta say, the two ""bad"" or ""not as good versions"" of these films are Fight Club and Memento, while the better ones are the Usual Suspects and Sixth Sense, and here's why:<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects and the Sixth Sense gave a CONCRETE, CUT AND DRY answer at the end. An answer that allows the audience to say ""Ohh, well THAT explains EVERYTHING.""<br/><br/>In Fight Club and Memento, while their stories were every bit as riveting as the former two, the payoff wasn't at big at the end. They gave kinda cheap answers that leave viewers asking ""What about this? What about that? And what about that other time?"" which in fact are subsequently answered by the characters one by one, but some of them are kinda half-assed, dubious, and just plain too easy that anyone coulda thought of them as explanations. Ultimately this leaves some viewers disappointed, often saying ""THAT was it? I coulda came up with that!"" (Though in Fight Club, this could've been amended had they ended the film the same way they end the novel).<br/><br/>Note to filmmakers: When you have a gimmick, it becomes a RULE for that screenplay. OBEY IT! At anytime should you so much as BEND it, IT becomes another time the audience will say, ""Well how do you explain THAT!?"". If you don't always have the answers, THINK ABOUT IT. Don't just settle for the easy ones, compromising and detracting from what could be an otherwise great script. E.g. The Sixth Sense. Gimmick: Bruce is DEAD. He can't talk or touch ANYONE except the boy. At no time (until the closing and closure of the film) did Shyalaman break that rule. Hence: A MASTERPIECE!<br/><br/>As for this film, I thought it was VERY well written and conceived until the end when all is revealed. The Revelation as it turns out, is disappointing. I would give it an 8 out of 10. HOWEVER, it's ranked #14 of all-time on this database. I don't think it's anywhere near being one of the top 50 of all time. So seeing that people have rated it so high, I'm giving it a 1 to compensate for people's lack of good judgement."

The score and sound design were not particularily great either, I can't even seem to remember if there was any music at all. My third and final complaint is about the acting. While the actors sometimes shined and truly showed the pain and tragedy of memory loss, most often the performances were quite bland and not something I will remember about this film.<br/><br/>The story, writing, and directing, however, was absolutely brilliant. In true Nolan fashion, he has created a wonderfully complex, interesting and truly unique story that is told in a very original and captivating way. It gives you something to think about, and the way it is all connected as well as how it gives us information and reveals, is extremely rewarding. Thank you, Cristopher Nolan, for this fantastic movie. I will not forget it for a long time."

","Leonard Shelby, who suffers from short-term memory loss, attempts to find the identity of the surviving thug who raped and murdered his wife (Jorja Fox) by retaining Polaroid photos and notes that are stuffed into his pockets, and by tattooing essential clues on his body. Although he was able to shoot and kill one of his wife's two assailants, the second villain caused him a serious blow to the head, damaging his brain. The police do not believe in a second attacker. As Leonard remembers the past before his wife's murders, he has anterograde, and not retrograde amnesia, and knows how to read, to drive, get gas, handle personal affairs, etc. If Leonard's conversations exceed 5 minutes or so, he will forget what the subject was to begin with. His personal struggles are obviously great. When he awakens, he has to determine where he is and how he got there. When a man chases him, he is at first confused and thinks he is chasing the man and wondering why. He knows the truth when the other man fires a gun at him.<br/><br/>To tell the tale, Director Christopher Nolan demonstrates an unusual take: there are two alternate timelines. They comprise a black and white part told chronologically and the color sequence division that is told in reverse (non-linear). They merge in the middle of the film although the black and white scenes continue to nearly the end. Each scene is divided into 5-10 minute segments.<br/><br/>The film begins in color with the murder of major character John Edward ""Teddy"" Gammell (Joe Pantoliano) and works backwards to show the events leading up to it. Leonard, in his own mind, believes that Teddy was one of two assailants that killed his wife. But Leonard is looking at the picture from his own (flawed) perspective. Teddy may be a corrupt undercover cop who takes drug money to enrich himself, and even uses Leonard for his own purposes, but he is no murderer or rapist. And the way the film is constructed, we probably have to believe Teddy's comments because there is no other explanation from the director. Nevertheless, Leonard wrote ""Don't believe his lies,"" under Teddy's photograph, and Teddy was doomed.<br/><br/>Then there is the woman, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Morse), who also has her own agenda and definitely uses Leonard. Her boyfriend is drug dealer Jimmy Grantz (Larry Holden). Near the end of the movie, in the last black and white segment, Leonard murders (again) Jimmy because he thought that he was the man who supposedly killed his wife. During the confrontation, Leonard receives those two annoying scratches seen throughout much of the film. After that Teddy warned him to leave town, discard Jimmy's expensive suit, and drive his jaguar because he would be a sitting duck for dealers looking for him. Leonard ignores Teddy.<br/><br/>The black and white chronological portion explains Leonard's life as an insurance claims investigator. He has authority to handle the case of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who has claimed short-term memory loss as a result of an automobile accident. After many tests Leonard concludes that Sammy's problem is mental, not physical from the accident, and advises his company to deny the claim. Later to test her husband, his diabetic wife subjects herself to a fatal test. Nevertheless, near the end of the film in a color sequence, Teddy explains to Leonard that Sammy was faking and never had a wife, and that it was Leonard's spouse who was a diabetic. Furthermore Teddy explains that it was he as a cop who was assigned to Leonard's wife's case. The two of them tracked down the thug and killed him. Also, he states that his wife survived the assault, and that Leonard invented Sammy's story as his own! Did Leonard forget to give his wife an insulin injection? Or did he give her too many? Assuming Teddy was telling the truth, why doesn't Leonard remember that his wife was a diabetic? Note that there is a color scene where Leonard lies in bed with his wife. He does appear to give her an injection in her right thigh, and right after pinches it. And near the very end we see tattoos are already on his body with his wife alive. She must have survived the assault.<br/><br/>The film ending is in color and shows Leonard driving up to Emma's Tattoo parlor. Guess what he will have tattooed on his body this time!?<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch throughout, as is the editing and pacing. The storyline is unique, to say the least, in the way the timelines are presented. Viewers have to pay close attention and trust their own memories when watching this one! I believe that there is a plot hole. Near the very end we see tattoos on Leonard's body with his wife alive. On the left side of his chest, a tattoo reads, ""I've done it."" (So he killed the thug who assaulted his wife.) But why is the particular tattoo missing throughout the movie? Anyway, Joe Pantoliano steals every scene where he appears. By the way, the movie doesn't say, but if this writer were a betting man he would say that Joe Pantoliano's character is called Teddy because of his strong resemblance to Teddy Roosevelt when he was a Rough Rider. Check out his old photos circa 1898."

","Memento was a very good film about a man called Lenny with anterograde amnesia and in order to progress with his journey he takes photographs and write on them to remember. The storyline uses a technique called fabula and ceujet which is Russian and means the story line from the black and white to the colour crosses over after building from different points."

","This film is essentially an exercise in non-linear narrative- not that that's a completely bad thing. Having been told that this was one of 'the best films of all the time', and 'brilliantly written', I was disappointed when i watched it, especially towards the end. I enjoyed watching the film however as it is a tricky and entertaining puzzle to solve. This is a good viewing experience, and a good starting point for Nolan who went on to make some solid films."
"eldenwang","7","2","3","25 January 2017"," Better Watch from the End
","This movie is great not because of wonderful stories but how they are told. I could not figure out what this movie is trying to say for the first time I watched it. However, I knew these stories were narrated from the end for the second time and could narrowly understand the whole structure. After watching many masterpieces of Christopher Nolan, I gradually developed a particular sense to know how the plots would go on because his technique is basically playing with clips. This movie tells a very simple story that the leading role's wife was 'murdered' somehow, and he tried his best to find and kill the 'murderer'. Monochrome scenes were narrated from the beginning while colorized ones from the end. Only at last could we know that it had always been him that created puzzles and solved them himself."

","This film is a work of art on self-delusion. But not the self-delusion of the main character but the self-delusion of viewers and critics that praise this movie as the new Citizen Kane!! My respects Mr· Nolan! You managed to make thousands to believe they watched an artistic, complex and challenging film out of a simplistic, boring, really boring! gimmick that just edits a story backwards.<br/><br/>If the film would show the story in order the ""mystery"" disappears, hence the gimmick. I recognize the edition and the acting, that's why I don't rate it lower. But good edition or good acting don't mean good films. What about cinematography as such? What about the viewing experience? What about thought provoking craft? Complexity and pleasure don't come from just toying in the edition room. But apparently many people was framed to believed so. My respects Mr. Nolan."

","This is a decent movie, it's in no way a masterpiece/classic! People rating this a 10 or a 4 star movie have been fooled to believe the movie is somehow deeper then it actually is. It's actually a very simple movie. When you first watch the movie you aren't sure what's going on (confusion is the intent to kind of give the viewer Leonard's perspective), you believe it's a mystery and are trying to piece things together, but in all actuality, it's not a mystery and there is nothing to really piece together, which is fine, just don't kid yourself that it's some type of mind bender that you as a viewer must figure out. Spoilers At the end of the day, Leonard is constructing these endeavors to give his life meaning...that's the big ahhah moment! So the whole time you're trying to figure out what's going on, the answer is; Leonard is just giving himself something to do. Not that big of a deal. Not a biggie, but the scene where Leonard found out that the Motel Clerk was ripping him off was kind of lame. Wouldn't that be something worth writing down, rather then chuckling about? It's kind of a big deal."

The film left me exhausted trying to follow it. While I do realize that is somewhat the purpose of the film, it certainly doesn't make it a top 100 film based simply on being different. The story itself wasn't in my mind ""Top 200"" worthy. By breaking nearly every story-telling convention in terms of the time-line, and to this extreme, the only person associated with this film deserving of accolade is the editor for having the patience to piece this thing together. If you want a good break from typical narrative structure see ""Groundhog Day"" instead.

","Don't get me wrong, the idea for how the story was told was a great one. All the characters did a great job, and all the actual filmmaking was great.<br/><br/>There was one problem: THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS A LIE!<br/><br/>Most murder mysteries involve a twisty plot, wherein there is an uncovering of the truth that the viewer didn't yet put together - but COULD have! Memento didn't have that.  At the end, where you usually get the answer to how this all works, you find out that the main character has been lied to himself all along.  Given his condition, there was no way to determine that, or sleuth it out from the details given previously.<br/><br/>In effect, the makers of this film seemed to put 100% of their energy into a really great concept, and put zero effort into actually making this into a murder mystery.  They effectively pulled the alibi, and the final plot out of thin air!<br/><br/>Watch the film, it's really not that bad, and it's entertaining until the end, but at the end, don't say I didn't warn you!"
"Cheetah-6","4","2","3","27 July 2002"," Clever But Tedious.
","Maybe this film is, as others have stated,  trying to give us the experience of being Leonard rather than just observing him, so we end up being just as confused and frustrated as he is, for that I can give it allot of credit, I know of no other film that attempts to give you the experience of the main character in such a literal way, but this of itself does not make a great movie. Solving an involved math equation might be a better time. There has to be some character development, these characters never become interesting and the motivation of the main character for revenge seems shallow and becomes boring quickly. Everything seems to ride on weather Teddy is telling the truth or not. This is never reveled and so everything is open to speculation. Probably one of the best films ever concocted for the purpose of  discussing endlessly afterward and for multiple viewing.  A plot that you care about would help allot here. I could appreciate the cleverness of it all if the story was more of a hook.  Leonard thinks revenge will give him peace? Even though he'll never remember it? All he remembers is his life up to ""the event"" but is able to remember he has short term memory loss? It seems this film is trying too hard to be something ""original"" and ""creative"" and comes of more like an exam puzzle and is seriously lacking a soul."

"dbn3","6","2","3","1 February 2002"," Interesting Concept, Flawed Execution (5/10)
","(I saw this on DVD, YMMV)<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby is a man who has no short term memory since being injured defending his wife an attack that resulted in her rape and murder.  For some reason that is not really clear, the police have never caught the attackers, so Leonard has vowed to hunt down and kill them.  However, he cannot remember a thing that has happened since the day he lost his short-term memory and ten minutes ago.  Therefore, he is constantly having no memory of why he is doing things and uses a series of pictures and notes to help sort it out.<br/><br/>To give the same feeling to the audience, the director shows the scenes in reverse order.  The opening scene of the movie essentially has Leonard looking at a picture of Teddy with the words ""kill him"" written underneath in his handwriting.  Leonard proceeds to kill Teddy.  Just as that is all Leonard has to go on, that is all the audience has.  Then the movie backs up a little bit and shows Leonard gleaning the last bit of information that convinces him Teddy is the killer and we see him actually writing ""kill him"" on Teddy's picture.  This backing up continues until we find out the real secrets in the movie.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Guy Pierce gives a very good performance as Leonard.  <br/><br/>The transitions between the scenes are very smooth.  There is just enough overlap at the start and end of each scene that the transitions are very easy to follow.  In addition, there is a small part of the film that runs forward in time, mostly Leonard telling a backstory to someone on the phone. These are easily distinguished by being shot in black and white, while the rest of the film is in color.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>There is an unrelenting lust for death that drives Leonard.  No one, not even Teddy who might be a cop, discusses the idea of vigilantism.  That Leonard should hunt down and kill whoever he thinks might be the killer, the justice system be damned, is never questioned.  It is the mindless writing of a bad action movie at work here.<br/><br/>Although the reverse order presentation is easy to follow, it began to wear thin.  Perhaps it is because, and other reviewers have mentioned, that this story told in chronological order would be weak, at best.  The film relies too much on this one trick of storytelling without anything else to really back it up.<br/><br/>The clincher that something is desperately wrong is the pat summation speech at the end of the film.  Throughout the film, the reliance is on how Leonard is going to remember some particular fact, but we are only given the quickest glances of the actual results of Leonard's investigations.  In an attempt to make a rather dull story seem mysterious, the makers have told us so little about the story that they make up for the error with ""the speech that explains everything.""<br/><br/>5/10"

This IS a solid film; well acted, directed and definitely well written. Although I have seen this basic plot twice before, I haven't seen it in a movie or so well done. The combination of Leonard's brain damage and the reverse chronologic filming allow one of the most bizarre plot twists I've seen.

I like the atmosphere and the cinematography, but the story is really not that great. It may not be true, but I like the idea that the Nolans had a story, with no curve or central conflict, so their solution to this problem, was reverse the story. In my opinion a rather cheap call. It works only because the audience is not used to a work with a text this way, starting with the end.<br/><br/>Personally I had a much better experience with Sabu's Monday (1999).<br/><br/>I warmly recommend it even if you liked Memento, and you probably did."

First off i'd like to mention a certain convience of this movie, how can the main character remember that he has a memory disorder, yet can't remember anything else? Think about it, he'd constantly live in the present, and be completely unaware of living in the present, the only way he'd know he was living in the present would be if someone was there to tell him that. So that's a MAJOR plot hole. that's not the worst thing about the movie, the worst thing is that the character's are flat, the plot is flat - C'mon a plot about a guy searching for the guy who killed his wife, with NO twists (if seen without the contrived plot)boring characters, and lame dialogue. Watched in regular motion this movie is not interesting at all. Some people were comparing this to Lynch. Well, comparing it to what lynch has done so far, he ALWAYS uses interesting characters and great atmosphere to tell his stories, not just some lame plot contrivance. The movie isn't terrible, it has it's moments, but it's annoying that it's getting so much praise when movies like lost highway get trashed. Look at Pulp Fiction, Tarantino didn't use just the plot contrivence to make his movie interesting... oh ya and i didn't re read this, bollocks to all the grammar and spelling errors!<br/><br/>5/10 Boring, contrived story, with flat characters, the only saving grace is the surprises that occasionally pop up.

I'm not going to come down too hard on this, but this is one of those films which is so concerned with how cleverly it tricks the audience (6TH SENSE, USUAL SUSPECTS) that it inevitably will be a let down when all the plot mechanics are revealed as a giant ruse. Not to say that clever plotting is bad, but the final results have to be a revelation - or carry a deeper resonance (i.e. THE CONVERSATION, Godard's LA CHINOISE or Bunuel's masterpiece BELLE DE JOUR) not just a cheap cinematic trick. Check out Nolan's FOLLOWING for a better, less cynical, treatment of a similar theme."

Also the plot twists are all sharp and interesting, save the end twist which destroys any chance for catharsis on the audience's part. <br/><br/>
But more than the ending of this movie bothered me.  Guy Pearce is a horrid horrid actor.  He is able to look brooding and that's about it.  Perhaps with a more skilled actor (Edward Norton would have been perfect) this movie might have actually achieved some emotional power.  But Pearce is only capable of looking brooding and cold.  He brings no emotional depth, which is why the ending didn't work because ultimately the audience doesn't care about his character.  Also the writing takes a turn for the worse around the middle of the movie.  The prime example of this is Guy Pearce's incredibly trite ""the bed is cold"" speech which begins with boring sensory detail and delves into painfully bad rhetorical questions.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie fails to bring a payoff to the audience.  It starts off as a beautiful film noir that melts into your mouth like a piece of dark chocolate.  but the bitter aftertaste will get you."

","Granted this movie is out of the ordinary. But since this movie is #9(?) overall here on imdb, my expectations was high. So I was very disappointed when I had seen the movie through. The film lacks attention to detail, and thus has lots of problems where you, as audience, begin wondering why the director/writer ( unknowingly? ) has made so many errors with regards to conditions of the mind and realistic human behaviour. Id say that if you are fan of well worked and really intriguing storytelling, go watch a David Lynch movie. His movies doesn't pretend to be something they are not.<br/><br/>
Sorry to all the people who feel this is a really brilliant movie, but it is not up there to me. It is a sad story told backwards, with an uninteresting philosophical twist about what people will believe when they cant distinguish between truth and lie."

","Christopher Nolan and company must be having a good laugh over the effort we poor fools have been expending in trying to understand ""Memento.""  I watched this on DVD once from the beginning to the end and then back again, and I have come to the conclusion that trying to put together a coherent linear narrative with a beginning, middle and end from the jumbled fragments we are given to work with here would be an exercise in futility.  The truth is that by the time each revelation has finished contradicting the one that comes after it (or before it?), you are ultimately left with nothing but thin air. Some have said that ""Memento"" tells its story in reverse order from the end to the beginning, but this is one thing that it does not do.  If that were the case, then the final scene at the tattoo parlor would be the beginning of the story, which, of course, it is not.  In fact, trying to pinpoint just when the story begins is impossible.  I think the filmakers have made us all the victims of a fiendish prank, but I for one do not think ""Memento"" is nearly as clever as it thinks it is.  Oh, and Guy Pearce's rapid-fire monotone almost put me to sleep!"
"Aeth","6","2","3","20 August 2001"," A string of pearls ...
","This interesting movie is about a man who can only remember stuff that happens within a minute due to an accident he had when some rapists were molesting his wife. The story shows us a man on a quest to revenge the death of his wife, but with a twist!  The movie moves backwards in time although the sequential series of events that progress in clusters are in a normal timeframe moving forwards in time.  This way of telling a story opens up the narration in such a way that new perspectives and surprises revels themselves at the beginning of each new cluster, thus creating a deeper understanding of the previous cluster / action. There seems to be a metatheme in this movie.  The main character was a detective for an insurance company before his accident.  Now the whole movie seems to follow the path such a detective would go by when investigating. Namely, starting out with the crime itself and working backwards untill the person who did it and the motive is found. This movie might also allude to the current state of our historical science, showing that memory, and especially history can be tampered with and changed (especially in the hands of less morally founded individuals).  Thus one might even say it is a profound criticism of the all objectivity. Basically though, this is a thriller about manipulation in its different shapes and forms, and how people use each others weaknesses to outwit each other and sometimes even themselves...."
"dasaffe","4","2","3","15 August 2001"," Nice Editing, Poor Film
","Perhaps this film's success will signal the transition of film from a medium of words to a medium of pictures, but that doesn't mean i have to approve.  The problem with Memento is that the film shown backwards (ie without the gimmick) would not be watchable.  The plot develops at a slow pace, the dialogue is riddled with ughs, every time Guy says he has a ""disability"" as an example (South Park speaks more intelligently about the topic).  The acting is flat, which i think could be attributed to the filming process during which the actors have said they weren't told much about their roles.  The film is mostly predictible, barring plot twists which seldom make sense due to the backwardity. One thing that this film proves even moreso than The Limey (a better, if average, movie) is that editing counts. Another thing this movie proves, except this time by bad example, MUSIC counts.  The score in Memento is typical pad swells and synth strings, it only hinders a film which would be much more riveting with no music (or perhaps some odd backwards soundscapes). While the directer immerses you in the world of the amnesiac, it's not a world worth inhabiting, as nothing is really happening.  Memento is sort of like throwing a party but spending all your money on the band and not being able to afford invitations.  It's just you sitting alone, enjoying the show of your life (the editing), but wondering why you bothered. 6 of 10"
"teslar","6","2","3","6 August 2001"," average movie with a good finale
","Memento has an extremely artificial feel to it. Given the way the story is told, this was probably unavoidable, but I find that it hinders true immersion into the film.<br/><br/>The other problem is that it takes absolutely ages to build up even a hint of suspense. After the initial surprise at the storytelling has faded away, one finds oneself sitting there, just waiting for something - anything - to happen.<br/><br/>Still - eventually the film does start and from that point until the end it leaves a very good impression. The storyline, even though it's extremely artificial, has been carefully plotted out and I certainly appreciate that it wasn't an easy task in this film.<br/><br/>In the end thus, it's a film worth seeing once... but it's nothing you'd want to watch over and over again."

","On the twelfth position in the top 250 of the IMDB I noticed a rather new movie that I hadn't seen yet nor heard from called MEMENTO. After reading some of the reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. It is never good to expect a masterpiece when you go see a movie, but the least I expected from this one was that it was going to be pretty damned good ! Unfortunately MEMENTO, for me, didn't live up to its expectations . The attempt to be original by twisting and turning the sequences in my eyes only had an effect in the scene where Guy Pearce hits Carrie-Ann Moss.

","I saw this movie after reading and hearing rave reviews for it, and I must admit that I was disappointed. I paid too much attention to its supposedly-confusing details after some of my friends (and printed reviews) told me the goings-on were murky, I was led to believe that if I blinked I'd miss out on something that might have been important.<br/><br/>(The following could be considered to be spoiling, so be prepared!) It is unfortunate I had been ""informed"" about this movie like I had, and here is why: the ending raps up its precedings perfectly, the whole thing has no ambiguity to it whatsoever like some people have been saying it does. Lenny's (he being the main character) tale ultimately turns out to be a psychologically- rather than a physically-based one, and I was let down because that felt somewhat cheap to me. I got to the end and received something I didn't really care about, it (he?) just wasn't very interesting. Simply chalk that up to my personal taste?<br/><br/>As I think about it more, to a certain and perhaps large degree I felt the way I did due to my unmet expectations, but still, even w/o the ones I had I would say that the story was unsatisfyingly executed. It is rather hard for truly rewarding films which use characters' deep psychologies as their real subjects to be made in my opinion, and this one didn't quite pull it off, not even close actually. For one thing I think too much effort was spent on being ""clever"" with its method of storytelling-in-reverse instead of trying to be compelling in legitimate ways, say by having characters with more depth: all in all I considered it to be a slightly above-average B-movie. So, after pondering the movie a bit I give it a 6 after my initial response of 7."
"Jack_Asterisk","5","2","3","24 May 2001"," Inventive but, in the end, insubstantial.
","Application of the sequential flashback technique is done very well for a while, and the technique as well as the protagonist's condition is cleverly exploited in several scenes to good effect.  However, it seems to me that this is one of those movies that, upon additional viewings, becomes less substantial rather than more substantial.  That's because the development of the characters is rather limited and the various twists of plot, done so cleverly, nonetheless fall prey to inconsistency and, eventually, little more than melodrama.  There are any number of problems with plausibility that, in the end, cannot be overlooked because of the film's reliance on its regressively expanding unravelling/complication of plot, and there's not enough in the development of the characters to rescue it from the corner(s) into which it paints itself.  An ambitious effort, though.  Pretty good acting, too.  Not sure if I'd see it again, though."

","Highly recommended (IMDB's #10) and Oscar-nominated, I found Memento a disappointment.  Unique ""flashback in installments"" structure became annoying after a while.  Characters, including Pierce, had no real redeeming features.  I felt sorry for Pierce and his ""condition,"" but his ultimate lack of nobility or any nice-guy appeal made it hard to really care. (Compare to his and Russell Crowe's characters in ""L.A. Confidential."") Left me wishing for more substance and less style.  5/10"

After the first half hour it starts to make sense though.  Still, it is not a movie you can just passively watch; it does take some effort on the part of the viewer to understand what is happening.<br/><br/>Some have criticized this film as having glaring plot holes.  I disagree. Leonard's problem is not what it seems and the answers to many of these ""plot holes"" are right there in the film.  Watching this film once is not enough.

"royceueoka","8","1","1","18 April 2020"," To explain Nolan, one must go back to this memorable film.
","In this nine million dollar sophomore film, written in signature Nolan non-linear fashion, protagonist Leonard, who suffers from short-term memory loss, is followed on his quest, to create meaning out of his wives death. The highly philosophical screenplay, incorporates complex themes, like free will vs. determination, existentialism and Schopenhauer's ""subjective idealism"", without coming of as pretentious or sacrificing it's entertaining quality. Eventhough Leonard moves around like a chess piece, it's on the one he created. The synapsis of his odd, but conscious action, restarting a cause and effect chain, which revokes his freedom, gives Sartre's idea of acting in ""bad faith"", due to his special identity, a complete new spin.
The film's concept, of the viewer going back, to find unterstanding, can be projected to his entire oeuvre, since this movie is the blueprint, he stayed more or less true to, in all of his following movies. You got a narcissistic but driven anti-hero in a suit, moving through a non-linear plot, just to leave you with confusion or even better than that deep thought, provoked by the open ending. Nolan went on, to create monumental 165 million dollar works like ""Interstellar"", but what makes him great, is his ability to aim just as high, while staying on the ground."
"haydenluz","10","1","1","15 April 2020"," Memento
","Christopher Nolan took his brother's short story Memento Mori, and turned it into a serious cinematic masterpiece! No disrespect to Nolan's first piece in The Following, but this is the film that truly jumpstarted his marvelous career. Nolan created this original & nifty narrative, with a creative structure that was so mysterious & witty; with every layer that got peeled back, it got more and more intriguing. Chris Nolan has this act of always keeping his movies entertaining, with great pacing. One of the best thing's he does is create such a mysterious story, that it has such tremendous rewatch value, that only makes you appreciate the movie that much more. The film is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed throughout; a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse.<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest fan of Guy Pearce to begin with, maybe because I never really gave him a fair chance, with watching his movies like, Iron Man 3 & Bedtime Stories, but he really changed my mind here. He puts on a fantastic performance! To back up his performance, was a beautiful script written by Chris Nolan himself. With such an intelligent, and memorable script, Nolan was up for an Academy Award in 2002 for Best Original Screenplay, but came up short to Julian Fellowes who wrote Gosford Park. There was not one boring piece of dialogue within the film, while having it's fair share of powerful quotes.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm definitely going to have to rewatch this again to pick up some missing pieces, but this is an absolute, must watch!"

"skepticskeptical","8","1","1","12 December 2019"," Fascinating and Frightening
","Memento certainly charts new cinematic territory with its odd yet compelling structure of non-chronological flashbacks of a man who has lost his ability to form short-term memories. They are not his flashbacks, for he is the protagonist of all of them. But the structure allows the viewer to imagine what it would be like to be him, dealing with a totally fragmented experience caused by brain damage. The result is fast-paced, compelling and more than a bit disturbing. I was glued to the screen for the length of the film, so obviously it was convincing enough in the moment to hold my attention, despite the kaleidoscopic structure.<br/><br/>I do have a post-viewing question, which fortunately did not pop up while I was watching, else it might have disrupted the flow: How can the protagonist remember that he has lost the ability to form short-term memories? When he is compared to Sammy, there is a world of difference. Sammy does not know that he cannot form the memories. Lennie, in contrast, is completely fixated on this single idea, which drives his action and motivates everything else that he does.<br/><br/>Despite that single quibble, the film is quite thought-provoking and may serve as a cautionary tale, now that brain tech is being developed by DARPA to control soldiersÂ´ minds, making them manipulable in precisely the way the lamentable protagonist of Memento has become. This work is both fascinating and frightening."

This film deserves to be watched at least 2-3 times to fully comprehend the story and to truly appreciate the master piece this film really is.<br/><br/>Imagine yourself in a tragic situation where you and a loved one are involved in a car accident, the other person dies immediately from the impact of the crash, and you survive but suffer serious brain injuries that affects the functionality of an essential part of your brain where all the short term-memories are stored; Moreover, due to your brain injury you are diagnosed with Anterograde Amnesia, which means that you lose the ability to create new memories, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. Furthermore, let's suppose that the last thing you fully remember is witnessing your loved one die in the accident, and everything else you experience in your present life fades away during your sleep every night or within short periods of time. In such hypothetical situation, how can you heal your grief if you can't feel the passage of time? How can you heal if the most recent and profound memory you have is of your loved one dying? How can you find meaning and purpose in your new life if you cannot retain new feelings, memories, and experiences to reflect upon tomorrow or the future? It's a tough situation to imagine yourself in, isn't it? This is the philosophical theme that Memento (2001) presents in a unique multilayered storyline in which the past and the present collide, and just like the main character, the audience questions what is real and what is not.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film! One of my all time favorites."

In my opinion I feel like the movie lets the audience kind have their own opinion's about it. Furthermore, the audiences who will enjoy this are people who like to put things together. Overall the film is very entertaining."
"collateralcable","8","1","1","9 June 2017"," Memento is a Truly Intriguing Journey
","Before Inception and The Prestige, Christopher Nolan created a film with a completely different feel that is based on his brother's short story that follows a man lost in his own mind, unable to separate truth from lie.<br/><br/>Memento is centered on Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, who is a man determined to find and kill the one who raped and murdered his wife. However, throughout this investigation, he experiences one immense handicap: he is unable to retain any memories after the death of his wife. Despite this setback, his determination leads him to take pictures, write notes, and even tattoo himself with facts he refuses to forget. This is only the first sign that he won't stop until the man he wishes to kill is dead.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the movie for future audiences, I would like to start out by saying that this movie has a fascinating flow in its sequence of events, and it gave me true joy when I first recognized this unique element. If you have already seen Christopher Nolan's later films, recognize that Memento is nothing like them, nor should it be. It has a completely different pace while intellectually expecting much from its viewers. This is a movie that demands your attention, and I can say without a doubt that it received mine. It is as though the movie is always challenging you to be as perceptive as you can, while taking note of the most minute of details that flash by you on the screen. I don't believe this is a perfect movie (although I have yet to find anything of the sort), but it is a movie that excels in so many ways, creating interesting characters, an interesting setting, and most importantly, an interesting flow.<br/><br/>If I haven't said it already, Memento is an incredible movie that should not be missed. It is unique and knows how to separate the fun pace from the emotional plot, giving it even more flavor. I personally found it difficult to emotionally bond with Leonard, given that he didn't always seem as heartbroken as he should over his deceased wife. Fortunately, I didn't find this issue to be nearly enough to hold this movie back from being truly amazing movie that captivates audiences of all kinds."

","I'm not sure if I've ever thought so much about a movie after I finished it than I have with Memento. Where to even begin with this movie...<br/><br/>I remember that all of the performances in the movie, especially Guy Pierce of course, were very solid and believable. I liked the almost noir-feeling that it gave off, and I liked the setting a lot too. But none of these are the selling points of the movie. <br/><br/>The way this movie presents itself is so unique and thought provoking. The way that the story is told is unlike anything I've seen before, and the way Nolan uses colors and editing to piece a story that leads into the middle of itself is so weird and experimental, but it makes this movie so great. I can definitely see how this method of storytelling made a lot of these people leave 10/10 ratings.<br/><br/>There were a few things about the movie I was a bit off on, however. I do wish that the movie didn't spoil its chronological climax at the beginning of the movie, because it kind of ruined the rest of it in my opinion (even though the plot twist at the end of the movie was unexpected). I found this movie to be kind of confusing at times, and sometimes I couldn't help but lose track of what was happening. I get that in a sense it's supposed to make you feel that way though, so maybe we can chalk those up to my stupidity. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd really like to see more films take risks like this did. There are so many points where this movie could've gone wrong, but it never did. Maybe I'd consider making this a 9/10 on a second viewing, but either way I'm completely sold on Memento."

","It's a pretty cool idea. The last thing Leonard (Guy Pearce) remembers is someone killing his wife - since then he's had a head injury and has not been able to form new memories (a little like the start to Dark City). He takes pictures, makes notes, tattoos himself to try to order his life - but ultimately he does not know what he's doing. All that drives him is the desperate desire to track down the elusive 'John G.', who raped and murdered his wife. The film starts at the end of the story and works backwards (yes Raquel - backwards).  The only problem is, the scriptwriters seem to have suffered the same defect as their protagonist and forgot to wrap up all the questions actually posed at the start of their script.<br/><br/>
Just when you're thinking ""This is a really clever piece of film!   I have no idea what the real answer is."" the screen goes blank and the credits start to roll. The story doesn't go back to who actually killed his wife, and dodges with some philosophy about 'who are we if we don't have our memories' - which is nice, but not strong or original enough to justify the weak script. Plus, this philosophical point is not exactly proven by the sudden ending - it would have been just as strong with some answers to the plot.<br/><br/>Like: Who is Teddy? Why is he really involved? Was Leonard actually caught up with the other characters before his wife died? Why does he have two, apparently contradictory, sets of memories? Just a couple of big holes that lower the quality of what had the potential to be a really brilliant film. Still kudos to the acting, directing, and the 2/3rds of the script that they call a movie."

In one he is the focus of change as others are the unchanging scenery while in the other he remains the same as the others develop and transform before our eyes. In GHD the central character learns to use the world to his advantage and his journey ends when he is ready for acceptance (he goes through the seven stages of loss).

And it doesn't have a hint of pretentiousness. It's not being different just to be different.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with movies that have twists at the end, is that the writers/directors spend 95% percent of the movie luring you in, and then the last 2 minutes showing you how at all comes together. This was done well in ""The Sixth Sense"", and done poorly in ""The Prestige"", and ""The Lookout"". Both of the latter movies had serious promise, yet I just wasn't able to buy into them 100%.

"zetes","9","4","9","25 November 2001"," Truly, utterly brilliant
","I had grave doubts going into this one. Its fans seemed to me to be the same people who like a lot of the movies I really hated over the past five years or so, movies like The Matrix, Run Lola Run, Fight Club, and many others. I avoided it for a long time, though I always thought I had to see it no matter what. And when the chance to see it for free came along, I jumped at it. <br/><br/>Fortunately, Memento lives up to the hype. It's one of the few movies that can. Seriously, I wouldn't doubt that this movie will one day be counted as one of the best ever made. Perhaps not the ninth best ever, its current position on the imdb top 250, but it will certainly have its place in the history books.<br/><br/>The main reason for this is its unique narrative structure. Add this one to the ranks of Citizen Kane for its high level of narrative innovation. What it does is it tells its story backwards. It will give us one large chunk of narrative information, stop, and then rewind to the last place Leonard (Guy Pearce) began his small chunk of memory. You see, Leonard has this condition where he has little short-term memory. After a few minutes, he forgets everything that has happened to him since a serious injury. He reminds himself of his purpose every time he wakes up in a new chunk of memory through hosts of photos and notes that he has written to himself. His purpose: to avenge his dead wife. She was raped, and her rapist knocked poor Lenny on his head. This condition, which is the foundation of the narrative structure, is clearly false. You just have to suspend your disbelief as you watch, and, I promise you, you'll see something very unique.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is that it gives you some real mental exercise. It asks you to remember a large amount of information. Add to that the fact that not everything is trustworthy, and that truth and memory and facts and everything that we take for granted are constantly being questioned and warped, and you've got yourself an enjoyable uphill battle.<br/><br/>
The rest of the film is equally commendable, which ought to be remembered as long as you can retain it. The acting is quite good, especially Joe Pantoliano, so good in Bound, and Carrie-Anne Moss, with whom I was quite unimpressed in The Matrix. Here, she shows that she can play a complex character and that her main assets aren't her T&A. Guy Pearce is also quite good, though he was perhaps better in L.A. Confidential. I think someone else might have brought a bit more depth to the part, but perhaps not. One of the most difficult things about his role is the fact that he really has no complexities - he's a blank slate. One could honestly call him simply a tool of the plot. However, someone who would say that would be missing the fact that he is often being used as a tool by other characters. Christopher Nolan is not just a master scenarist, he's also an excellent director. Also great is the cinematography, sharp color with some spatterings of black and white.<br/><br/>Perhaps there are some plot holes, but I didn't notice them. This is truly a masterpiece, a film to remember. 10/10."

It's so much hogwash.<br/><br/>Having said, I didn't say I didn't find the movie interesting. I did, and enjoyed the performances of Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss. A man with no short- term memory goes back, scene-by-scene, trying to find the killer of his wife. It's a film I saw back in 2001 on VHS and I'd like to see it again, now that six years have passed since then.

The characters are as dull as the writing. I found it near impossible to relate to any of the characters as they are flat and emotionless, it felt like I wasn't even watching real people. I was disappointed in Guy Pearce's performance and a little surprised that Joe Pantoliano's character was the best part of this movie but it was not enough to make it a good film. I feel like the movie had to run in reverse otherwise it wouldn't be worth watching at all. The stability of the plot is constantly contradicting its self and is at times way over complicated. The flashbacks and narration really seem to distract from the story, not that it's that believable anyway with its lack of continuity. Since the events play out in reverse you already know what is going to happen and that completely eliminates any suspense. I believe with a better script and character development this movie could have been a lot better. I personally enjoyed the short story much better and wish the movie was more like the that.

"rajdoctor","3","3","6","24 June 2007"," Memento
","In India, one of the top Bollywood super stars Khan  Amir Khan is making a movie. We hear that he is very choosy, selective and does lots of discussion with the Director of the movie before saying YES. So when he said yes to act in a movie everyone got interested and we knew that he is re-making a Tamil version of a movie called Ghajini in Hindi for national release. While reading the story of Ghajini, I remembered that this story is something I have seen. I thought for a while and realized that during one of my International flights I saw a movie (and felt asleep half way) with same story line. So researching on the web  I found that the story on which Ghajini is made is Memento. That is when I decided to give Memento another shot, determined not to sleep this time during the viewing.<br/><br/>The story is about a man Leonard (Guy Pearce) whose wife (Jorja Fox) is killed and due to the fight with the killer Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), Leonard looses his short term memory. Leonard remembers every event till his wife was alive, but after that his memory captures only events for 12 seconds maximum. To remember that he has to take revenge for his wife's murder  he has tattooed all over his body the events and facts, and he keeps taking photographs and writes lots of paper notes to remember what he has to do, where he has go etc. That is the way Leonard takes the revenge and kills his wife's killer.<br/><br/>It is a typical revenge story. What makes people interested are two things  the concept of 12 seconds memory thrown in and the story is told backwards by the Director Christopher Nolao; meaning the movie starts with the killing of the murderer, and it goes backwards to the scene when wife was killed. This I think is the unique selling point of the movie.<br/><br/>The Director must have really spent a huge amount of time and energy in scripting this unique concept. Why one should say the story backwards is a question I still am not able to figure out. For what purpose and sake  just for experimentation, just to show that yes a story can be told in this fashion too? I suppose YES. Earlier we have seen many movies of the same genre where the episodes are juggled and presented to the audience, and only through the last episode the real mystery is uncovered. But does Director Christopher succeed in this experiment? Yes  in getting audience interested in the concept, and yes in getting nominated for Oscars for best scripts and editing.<br/><br/>As I told earlier  during the first viewing I fell asleep, because I could not make head or tail of this movie. My second viewing, I forced myself to see it through the 113 minutes. I saw it. As the movie is presented in reverse, I viewed the movie twice in reverse to get hold of the story better. I must have spent about 250 minutes viewing this movie again and again from all possible ways. My verdict is the movie is badly made because: The director even though experiments with a new concept, but fails to hold interest of the audience. All the actors have acted with stoned faced expressions. The love scenes between Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne Moss (another woman Natalie  who helps him) are too irritating, distracting, clichéd and unnecessary for the flow of the movie. The direction  apart from the reverse presentation is very poor.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw is that it thinks that the audience is stupid and fool. I could not understand when this hero is not able to remember anything more than 12 seconds how come he figures out that he has kept the notes and photographs in his pockets? Every time he pulls them out  how his memory works then? The story seems to be said lasting two days in total, during which time  he solves the mystery and kills the murderer. What happened between the accident and that two days? How many days have gone by? I saw the movie backwards too. The precision with which he solves the mystery and leads up to the killer is so simple and like child's play  one thing leading to another. The director says that the police don't believe in the hero analysis and thus have not helped him. The efficiency and confidence with which the hero analyzes and corrects his notes is laughable. How he knows what he wrote earlier was false, just because someone has just said the opposite? Could be the person who just gave him the facts  must be telling lies. No questions asked  just a big gimmick by the Director Christopher  who wants to prove a point that he too can make an intelligent movie.<br/><br/>But according to me he has failed miserably. I would like to give this movie a zero rating out of 10 just to bring it out of the number 28 slot on IMDb database, but because of this unique concept and attempt I have to give him (Stars 3 out of 10)"

If this story was told in the proper chronological order, it wouldn't be a tenth as interesting as it is. I got the distinct impression the director blotched the movie and decided to get clever at the editing table. The performances by the lead actors are good but that still does not salvage the movie.

","How can ""Memento"" be ranked the 12th film of all-time by IMDB viewers/raters?  I agree that the film is extremly well-crafted, imaginative and stylish - but that does does make it a top-ranked film.<br/><br/>Above all, a film must first have a compelling plot/story-line (which ""Momento"" has) but it must be presented in some fashion that the viewer can reasonably hope to understand.  If it doesn't, then the film must convey its message to the viewer through visual and sound impact.  ""Memento"" is only average in the latter approach.<br/><br/>Frankly, this movie is just plain incomprehensible and fails miserably because of it.  I tried to understand it, but after awhile one reachs the ""I just don't care about these characters anymore"" point and gives up.  A truly great film must be outstanding in all facets of filmmaking and must be able to communicate its message to the general audience.  ""Memento"" fails on this count.<br/><br/>When people rate films (as with any other rating exercise that spans a long time period), they tend to remember and focus only on that which is ""fresh"" in their mind - in this case, recent films while forgetting and failing to keep the current film in proper perspective against the many, many truly great films of the past.<br/><br/>While an interesting film, ""Memento"" by no means deserves to be in the IMDB Top 250 films of all time."

He has such a banal, expression-less face and bland voice- just like he had in L.A.Confidential, another snooze-fest.

This is one of those movies that once you've seen it once, you'll probably never want to watch again. Like I already said, if this had been directed by someone like Darren Aronofsky and had a likeable leading man (at least someone with some acting abilities- not a 2nd rate ex-Australian soap actor), the maybe then this could have been a better movie.

"smaroun","8","3","7","12 May 2005"," Great movie, definitely a thinker!
","Memento is not a movie to be taken lightly. Do not get me wrong, it is definitely a good movie to watch, but it is not like many movies where you can watch it, sleep through the middle, and then wake up almost at the end and totally know what happened. These days many movies are like that, but not Memento. This is a very unique, from the way it was written, to the way it was taped, even to the way it was edited. It is a movie told backwards, in all sense of the meaning. You cannot understand the beginning without understanding the end, yet you cannot understand the end without the beginning. However, at the end of the movie, you do not go away with a feeling that something is missing, instead you get the majority of the movie, and you're are so excited to be able to say that, since most of the movie you were so confused, that you settle for the feeling that at least you got the basic idea behind the movie.<br/><br/>I encourage everyone to see this movie with someone else, because it is definitely a movie that gets better after a good discussion. There is a lot in the movie, and since it is told backwards, it is easy to forget some things, or to forget to tie two things together. That is why the movie gets better and more interesting after discussing it with someone else, and even watching it a second or third time. The main character, Leonard has a memory disorder, and is unable to convert short term memory into long term memory. This plays out in many ways, but most importantly in the way it affects the people around him. At first one would assume that the people around him are manipulating and abusing him because of his memory problem, but in the end, which in this particular movie was the beginning, there was definitely someone alive and someone dead.<br/><br/>Something else to think about when watching this movie is the difference between the black and white parts and the colored parts. At first it may feel that only the colored scenes are giving you the part of the story you want. However this is not true. If you watch the black and white scenes closely, you can figure out many of the secrets that make this movie to intoxicating prior to them being bluntly given away in or towards the end of the film. At first Leonard may seem like a simple guy, but you must realize he is more complex than I can explain without giving too much away. Understanding that even while he has no control over his memory, he still has a large amount of control over his life will make it a lot easier to understand. In the end, my explanation will do no justice to actually watching the movie, so I highly encourage it. But do it when there are no distractions, and perhaps when you have time to watch it a second time, even if it's not until the second day, but trust me this movie gets better the second time, and in many cases even the third time. It is well edited, and except for a few lighting problems, it is very pleasing to the eye. Over all, I think it is a top notch movie, and I do not understand why it took me so long to finally watch it!"

","Bad movie for the rest of us. <br/><br/>Dumb people are just going to say, ""huh?"" <br/><br/>Intelligent people are just going to roll their eyes at the stupidity.<br/><br/>Besides the ""how can he remember that he can't remember"" flaw, which makes a roll of toilet paper out of the whole movie all by itself, you have the obvious plot twists. <br/><br/>Everything is so predictable. It's a twisty movie, so you're looking for, and seeing, the twists. Natalie has bruises on her face when we first meet her? She's going to be hit. Lenny has scratches on his face? He's going to get his face scratched. Teddy starts to get in the old car, not the Jag, but Lenny says the Jag is his car, and Teddy laughs and says fine? We know the Jag's not Lenny's car, and we're just waiting to see how he got it. Teddy says roll up the window, and Lenny can't because it's been shot or busted out? We're just waiting for the shoot-out-the-window scene we know is coming. And on and on and on. <br/><br/>And is there anyone, even one person with a triple-digit IQ, who didn't know, upon first hearing that Natalie is helping Lenny out of pity, he thinks, that she's using him? Even one person? IT'S A TWISTY MOVIE! That means that everything you have to believe to keep the movie obvious, can't be allowed to be true, so you know right away that she must be using him.<br/><br/>The worst thing about the movie: the ""it's all been *beep* ending. Once you put in a movie anything that says ""it's all been *beep* then the whole movie becomes *beep* <br/><br/>How do we know the opening scene isn't a dream? Or any other scene? Because if the narrator is/may be lying/misrembering any scene (as he obviously is re his wife's death) then the whole movie becomes suspect. There's nothing left to chew on. After the very core of the movie--his wife's supposed murder--is exposed as possibly untrue, then what are you left with? Everything he's telling you/showing you might be untrue, might be misrembered or a lie. The opening scene might, if the writer later needs to, be untrue. I can see the Nolan brothers, when confronted with any logical flaws, saying, ""well, see, uh, that part, uh, that didn't actually happen, and you were supposed to figure out that Lenny didn't really kill Teddy, who, if it leads to further logical flaws, didn't exist. Uh, duh, uh, I think."" <br/><br/>The absolute first golden rule of movie-making must be: you can not ever say or show that anything we've been shown as movie factual (as opposed to character factual, that is, a character's opinion, or interpretation, as in Usual Suspects), isn't what actually happened. We can be lead to or jump to wrong conclusions that are our own fault (more intelligent twists). But the movie itself can't be allowed to lie to us. <br/><br/>Think of how easy it would be to be ""twisty"" (that is, mentally challenging to the average IQ crowd), if you just show X killing Y, and Z investigating, and at the end reveal that the director was just kidding, Q shot Y. It's just stupid, poor writing. <br/><br/>And in Memento, a movie told from Lenny's POV, if we're to believe anything, we have to believe that he remembers everything until his wife's murder. So once we see him with tattoos, with her, the whole movie becomes a joke. An idiocy. And it is scary that so few people posting here can't see that."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** It appears that though most of you loved the movie, you were lost in complexity in a story of biologically induced antero-grade amnesia.  A concept so intriguing and original to you that you could not even attempt to read between the lines further of a true master-piece.<br/><br/>Leonard's wife was beaten and sexually assaulted by only one man..Leonard was awoken and shot this man in the head and in the struggle suffered a severe contusion to his head.  Here is where the explanation starts to get a little confusing but bear with me.  Leonard's wife doesn't die from this incident.  Leonard, decides to attempt to con an insurance company (Leonard never worked for an insurance company).  Now, Leonard lives a fake life depicted by the black in white scenes of `Sammy'.  Anyways, the `Sammy story' was how Leonard actually killed his wife (thus it was in black in white because it didn't `really' happen as depicted through `Sammy'). After Leonard killed his wife from insulin shock, he became very mentally ill. It is almost certain that at this point Leonard's fake memory loss to scam an insurance company turned into reality as a psychological state (though not biological directly from the injury sustained).  This is why there are some inconsistencies with the biological memory condition.  Basically, Leonard's mind could think and adapt and selectively remember with no rhyme of reason due to psychosis that no one can attempt to explain (so any questions you have about this cannot be explained).  Thus, his psychosis mimicked that of his con-ed (scam) state of antero-grade amnesia but was not the same thing If this was a true case of antero-grade amnesia Leonard would not know he had the condition, not know his wife was dead, not know he was trying to condition himself, etc, etc.  I have seen true cases, where individuals act as though the wake every 5 minutes for the first time since an `event'. They are not able to walk around a city, they would certainly be so confused they would get lost.  They would not be able to condition themselves to use picture and structure to remember things.  This is because that part of their brain truly did not work anymore.<br/><br/>If you are still following me here you will realize that Leonard was soon placed in a mental hospital after he accidentally killed his wife from an insulin overdose (while trying to scam an insurance company).  The whole rest of the movie follows from the fact that while in the mental hospital Leonard was angered at those who didn't believe there was another killer of his wife the night she was rapped and `murdered' (this is made up in his head because she didn't even die then).  The officer assigned to the case Officer G (Teddy) was then used in his head as the person he wanted to kill eventually to `avenge' his wife's ""death"".  I will stop explaining the story from here.however I hope you can now watch the movie again from a totally different perspective.  That of a mentally ill individual seeking `revenge' for an incident that didn't actually occur.  It shows how powerful the human mind can be.  Though most of you do not have the perspective of a psychologist, I hope you can understand what I have said.  Some may say the movie's ending was very confusing, however it attempts to hint at what I have just stated.  Thus, it must end with losely to correctly depict a mentally ill individual where one moment of truth cannot be separated from a moment of non-reality.<br/><br/>Watch again.look for clues.here are some He burns a clock (clock = watch of wife setting back when he was giving her insulin shots) While `sammy' is in hospital there is a quick flash and you see for a second that Leonard is actually sitting in `sammys' wheelchair While in Natailie's house..Leonard is watching the news, bored he switches channels to a commercial like channel (just as `sammy did' etc..."

Pearce sets about find the killer of his wife, a difficult task for a normal investigator much less one with his ""condition"". The film's story is simple, the characters few, and there's no sex and little action or emoting going on.

","""Where am I?"" The first line blows away my mind each time I watch this movie. I had to watch Memento several times to understand what was going on in the movie. The story plot is intriguing and complicated. Yet, there is a pattern to it once you get a hold of it. I personally think that it adds immense depth to the movie. The greatest thing about this movie is that each time you watch it, you always get a different meaning out of it. Ever since I have seen this movie, I have shown it to my friends, and all of them enjoyed seeing this. I often find myself watching this movie when I am sad or caught up with stressful things that happened recently. <br/><br/>The premise of this movie is that main character, otherwise seeming ordinary, has this ""condition"" where he cannot make a new memory since his accident. But the movie is about more than that. It's hard not to reflect ourselves while watching the character struggles to grasp the truth and to find who killed his wife. Memento is also about moving on from the painful past and letting things go, which are two of hardest tasks we ordinarily go through each day. The wall between our memory and imagination is, in fact, very thin. Director Nolan does an excellent job in portraying that small wall, and suggesting that we all have this power and will when it comes to our own memory. Our memory is fragile and uncertain, yet it still exists in a certain form. Memento shows how we have this beautiful ability to recall and recreate the past events. Such creative power defines us as human, and as a result of that, a sequence of events turn into a journey of ultimate truth. What he finds at the end of this movie might be something that we are all seeking for in life. <br/><br/>When you are uncertain about your life, Memento is a great movie to watch and remind yourself about the complexity of your own memory and mind. The movie often leaves me with the high appreciation for memory. What our mind can do is quite remarkable. Although Nolan's Inception was bigger scale and had more actions in it, Memento remains to be my favorite Nolan movie."

At the end, I feel like Leonard would feel and I can understand what it is like to live with him. It's this feeling that makes this movie different from all others for me.

"mara-bravo","10","2","4","1 June 2011"," memento review
","When 'Memento' first released in 2000, there was an immediate hype around the movie. The movie wasn't just popular because of the quality of the movie, but especially because it was a film that was different from all the other films. <br/><br/>Memento is film that is based on a character called Leonard Shelby (which is played by Guy Pearce), who used to earn his money as a detective for an insurance company. He can't do this anymore since he got a strange form of amnesia when his wife was murdered. He remembers everything from before the murder of his wife, but now he can't remember everything longer than 15 minutes. Every 15 minutes he wakes up again, without knowing where he is and why. He does know about his own condition and so he tries to deal with it. Because of his condition he isn't really able to find the murderer of his wife, but he still tries. To help him in this quest he has tattoos all over his body, which contain hints and clues.<br/><br/>The thing that makes 'Memento' so special is the structure of the movie. Nolan tells the story backwards in which he starts with Leonard dealing with the murderer of his wife (Joe Pantoliana). Then the story is flashed back to the beginning. This is done in segments of about ten minutes. In between these segments, there are also the black-and-white sequences in which Leonard is seen in his motel room having a conversation, with god-knows-who, and telling a story about the past when he still worked for the insurance company. These sequences are chronological.<br/><br/>The most thrilling thing about this movie is the fact that you don't have a clue of what is going on until the movie is finished. This gives the viewer a lot of suspense and tension while watching and also makes it more ambiguous than watching an ordinary thriller. If you aren't a patient person and you don't like to pay a lot of attention while watching a movie this is not the right movie for you. The fact that Leonard had a form of amnesia makes him forget everything he has done. Each scene starts with the last part of the previous scene so you see some parts of the movie double. The fact that this is repeated is crucial though because it helps you understand the movie a lot better. This movie is very interesting and well put together. The order of the movie is very confusing but it interacts with the audience a lot. The viewers really need to ''puzzle'' all the scenes of the movie to form a coherent storyline. We thought the movie was very confusing at first but when the movie ended everything fell into place. After the movie is done you will be still confused for what happened earlier but also surprised. Guy Pierce did a wonderful acting job and you will be dragged into the movie as soon as he starts his story. The plot is very simple but the fact that the chronological order very different compared to other movies makes the movie that challenging. <br/><br/>We came to the conclusion this movie is not made for people who just want to have relaxing evening and watch a movie without really paying attention. This movie will confuse you and make you an investigator. We did find this amusing and very interesting to watch but we would understand why people wouldn't like this movie. People who enjoy challenging movies should definitely watch memento. This movie was well developed, had some wonderful performances, a clever structure and is very original."
"sddavis63","5","2","4","21 September 2009"," Certainly A Unique And Interesting Premise
","It's certainly a unique concept. Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who has no short-term memory after being attacked when trying to save his wife from a rape-murder. The rest of his life is spent in a quest for revenge - a revenge he can't remember if he's ever been able to achieve because he has no short-term memory. That's an interesting enough premise, the added piece here being the decision to offer us the story in reverse chronology - beginning with Leonard killing the man he believes to be his wife's killer (played by Joe Pantoliano) and then scene by scene retracing the story, going back just a bit at a time to fill in the details of his search, and how he came to the conclusion that Teddy was responsible. Essentially, then, the viewer is pulled into Leonard's own condition - seeing what's happening with no clue as to how it came about because we haven't seen what came before. Edited into the regression scenes are black and white scenes in which Leonard, holed up in his hotel room, essentially talks about his condition and seems to fill in some essential details about his past.<br/><br/>It's an interesting way to present a ""whodunit"" - because the question all the way through is whether Teddy is actually the killer. The ending offers up a twist - although it isn't the biggest surprise you'll ever see, if only because the way the movie is put together you're conditioned from the beginning to expect pretty much any twist possible, it still leaves open a decent bit of uncertainty about who actually killed Lenny's wife. So, the premise and construction of the story is interesting enough. Also interesting, though, is that - while it's intriguing - I just didn't find it particularly enjoyable to watch. Perhaps it's because I didn't buy Leonard's condition - for one reason. He used photographs to jog his memory, so he took pictures of important people, places, etc,. to refer to when necessary. What's wrong with that? Well - nothing, I suppose, except that I found it passing strange that, for a guy who supposedly forgets everything within a couple of minutes of it happening, he always knew exactly which pocket to find the pictures in. He NEVER had to search for one of his photographs; there was never even a moment of hesitation when he had to refer to one. That's a small point, perhaps, but it caused a bit of a credibility gap for me. The movie's well acted by the leads and interesting enough as the pieces of the puzzle are sorted out, but for me it fizzled a bit on that admittedly relatively small point. 5/10"

","This is just...I don't even know. I watched this years ago and was really blown away by its odd structure, but really it's rather simple once you get a grip on it - heinously simple, even. It's told backwards in a linear line and interspersed with black and white shots of the lead actor telling us the back story, so what? This movie is given a lot of credit for being complex, but it's not that mind boggling when you think about it. And the ending just feels like a huge slap in the face, especially after all that build up and guessing...it's deceitful! <br/><br/>And a lot of the first half of this is just too dull at times - especially the bits where the lead character is telling you about his client in the past who had a similar condition.

The deceit of the ending has its purpose and everything is fulfilled in the end; I just can't help feeling a little odd about it anyway. The strength of this movie just lies in the suspense that comes with it. Deceitful or not, it keeps you watching and guessing until the end. Sigh, this is a really dividing movie, as you can tell. You just don't know what to think about it, and I guess that's another good thing about it.

","Distinguished director Christopher Nolan comes out with his second directorial venture 'Memento', and this one surpasses every movie of its genre. The first fifteen minutes of the movie are completely undecipherable to the viewer, as it takes time for the audience to figure out the unique style of multiple narratives and reverse story-telling used by the director. After that, though, the movie grips your senses and takes you on a suspense-filled ride, and the suspense does not end until the credits start rolling down. The climax of the movie takes you off-guard and you keep on thinking about the movie for days. You have to watch it at least twice to understand each and every scene and dialogue. The movie has a great concept, and an excitingly taut storyline. Guy Pearce acts marvelously well, especially in scenes when he forgets his whereabouts and the identities of people he meets. Carrie-Anne Moss does full justice to her character, though her dialogue delivery is somewhat sloppy. Joe Pantoliano acts wonderfully, as usual. This one is my personal favorite in the genre of psychological thriller. The movie is refreshingly innovative, and I'm sure that viewers looking for an intelligent plot and a lightning-fast narrative. would revere this as the best piece of cinema of all time. The gritty direction also allows each and every character develop deeply, engrossing the viewers even more. Nolan is a master film-maker, and steers the movie through the mind of the protagonist, delivering a gripping thriller. He focuses more on the mentality of the characters, rather than the physical elements of the story. It somewhat reminds me of the short story 'The Sphinx without a Secret' by Oscar Wilde. All in all, this one is a must-watch, and your Hollywood viewing is incomplete without watching 'Memento'."

","Its most likely many viewers will think that filming a motion picture in reverse order makes it either ridiculous or over-the-top, but taking one look at Memento makes you realise that it actually works so well. I, for one, thought this cannot work in any shape or form. Upon viewing this movie, I believed I would be able to read through the plot and have everything (and anything) worked out in a flash, thus strengthening my notion that this 'back-to-front' concept is nonsense. How wrong was I? Memento is a film that makes you to go into the difficult and turbulent mind of a man trying his damnedest to seek revenge upon his wife's killer, but because of a condition which prevents him for remembering very recent events, finds it extremely difficult to do so; Guy Pearce is nothing short of brilliant as Lenoard, and certainly proves how versatile an actor he is. The perception of Memento is such, after only a few minutes of watching a particular scene, we are forced to reevaluate events witnessed. Its this strong aspect of the film that makes it so groundbreaking and legendary.<br/><br/>The final scene in Memento will leave the viewer trying hard to think what situation was what and how a certain situation occurred. Personally, I'm not sure why a certain event happened, but then again that is the whole point. Recording a film in reverse would normally be a complete waste of time, but watching Memento certainly discourages that thought. Excellent."

It doesn't have a caption and he doesn't question why. He is conditioned you see, he is confident. Leonard believes he can lead the life as the police conducts investigation, taking notes, relying on facts. Well, the problem is what are facts?

","End the from begins that thriller dark a. If you have problems with understanding the previous sentence, you are going to have even more trouble with understanding the film. Its basic idea is turning the action around. Not in a mechanical way, fortunately. ""Memento"" is a pack of scenes that end in the moment the previous scenes started in.<br/><br/>The main character is an ex-detective from an insurance company (Guy Pearce). His wife, as everything seems so, has been brutally raped and murdered while he himself was hit in his head. The effect of damage is the so-called short memory loss. Our hero remembers exactly who he was before that tragical incident, but he doesn't remember who he talked to and what about five minutes ago. That is why he has to write everything down. He collects Polaroid pictures of the people he meets. He fills his pockets with some quick notes. He even treats his own body as a big organizer and he tattoos his chest with the main memorized clue: ""John G. murdered your wife"".<br/><br/>This film has its own style and class. The idea itself about a guy who doesn't remember his experiences from a second ago is great. The ""reverse gear"" narration used here seems to be both logical and functional solution. Sometimes it is quite funny. For example, when the character doesn't know whether he chases someone or he is being chased."

Joe Pantolliano (Running scared, The Matrix, (HBO's) Sopranos) shows a somewhat differing side to his acting personality as Leonard's (suppossed) friend Teddy. He and Teddy have an adventure that they are on, called find a murderer. In between, the drama that every other one in the mix is bringing on as well, just to kind of confuse the whole issue.

Since so many of his other choices were also mine, and the reviews were sooo good, I thought I would give it a try. I would have been better spending those two hours in a dentist's chair.<br/><br/>While I love a movie that makes you think, is unpredictable, or genuinely unique, I found this movie to be completely and utterly confusing. <br/><br/>I understand the twist of moving this movie in reverse chronological order, I feel Nolan did it because otherwise his script would not have supported all the hype. The plot is rather thin. And the questions left unanswered at the end just do not justify all the positive praise.<br/><br/>While watching this, I kept thinking several things.. when did wifey actually die, who did he actually kill, was Teddy really a good or bad guy, etc, etc. <br/><br/>There are some clues at the end that do not add up. The last (first?) scene he is flashing back to laying in bed with his wife, yet he already has the ""I did it"" tattoo. We have previously been led to believe that all the flashbacks with his wife are true. Yet, he sports this tattoo with his wife, which has been established to be before this movie takes place. That same tattoo does not show up anywhere else during the movie, except in the picture Teddy shows him. How can this be?<br/><br/>If you watch the DVD extras there are MANY medical/psychological reports shown, which are inconsistent with the entire plot of this movie. <br/><br/>In my opinion, people tend to think because this movie is incomprehensible, it is good.

"jeev7882","10","2","4","22 August 2002"," Memento is quite simply the best thriller of all time. This is a completely original backwards thriller with outstanding performances from its entire cast and a screenplay that is unmatched by any other movi
","Note: This is a very difficult movie to review without making it a spoiler, but there is nothing in the following review that will ruin the movie for anyone who has not yet seen it.<br/><br/>I had no idea of what this movie was going to be like when I walked into the theatre, but I was hooked from beginning to end. First, the performances by Matrix veterans Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are masterful. Their characters play the audience just like they play Leonard, and that is what makes them so compelling. Pantoliano especially shines here in a performance similar to some of Joe Pesci's academy award caliber work. But the real prize goes to Guy Pearce who really puts himself on the map with a surprisingly sympathetic performance as a man out to get revenge for the murder of his wife. Pearce should have been recognized after his performance in the critically acclaimed L.A. Confidential, but he still remained in the dark due to the box office mediocrity of that film. Here we get to see his true potential in a role that should at least nab him a best actor Oscar nomination if not a win.<br/><br/>Additional praise MUST be given to Christopher Nolan who both wrote and directed this film, which was spawned from a short story written by his brother, Jonathan Nolan. Christopher's first film, a black and white piece called `The Following' (another must see film), displayed that he was a director with infinite potential. With Memento Nolan not only shows that he is for real, but also establishes himself as one of the premiere screenwriters and directors of the new generation.<br/><br/>We see Nolan's effect from the first scene of the movie: a brilliant shot of a Polaroid fading instead of developing. But this is just a taste of things to come in this backwards movie. After it is completely faded, the picture pops back into Leonard's camera and the entire opening scene plays backwards ending with Leonard shooting Teddy in the head. Throughout the rest of the movie, Nolan uses his color scenes to represent elements starting from the `end' and going backwards in time and he uses black and white to start at the `beginning' and go forward in time. Confused yet? Well, if that's not enough, the black and white scenes and the color scenes actually merge into one in the end of the movie so the final scene can finally piece together this intriguing and complex puzzle. Additionally, the color scenes overlap with each other and we have more and more revealed to us with each scene. This is technically the opposite of Leonard's experience, yet at the same times it allows us to feel exactly how Leonard feels because we are slowly given information until the end when everything comes together.<br/><br/>
I realize that what I said above may have been more than confusing, but that is how this movie plays out. Most viewers will need to see it at least twice to get the full experience of what Memento has to offer, and most viewers will also want to watch it a third, fourth, fifth, etc. time. This movie truly gets better with each viewing because you pick up new elements along the way each time. Personally, I picked up more on the `Sammy Jenkis' story. Sammy was a man that Leonard liked to talk about because also had a short-term memory problem. I did not fully understand the meaning behind this story until I saw it my second time, but Sammy Jenkis is just the tip of the iceberg. You won't be disappointed in the least bit unless you only see this movie once."

However, it's just as well that ""Memento"" did it that way, because the story does NOT stand up to even average scrutiny.  Worse, it is played out in a sluggish manner, the conclusion of which would be obvious about 15 minutes before the denoument, had the film makers not resorted to cheating (Something a genuinely great film such as ""The Sixth Sense"" never did.<br/><br/>The always excellent Guy Pierce plays a former insurance investigator who is searching for the men who raped and killed his wife and left him with brain damage, leaving him incapable of creating new memories. This forces Pierce to take some drastic actions (including tatooing his body with important clues) in order to maintain enough coherency to pursue his quest.  He is aided(?) by a waitress (Carrie-Ann) Moss and a mystery man (Joe Palantiano).  As, I said, the story plays itself out in reverse.  That's a pretty easy task, even for a student film maker.  Just edit the story out of sequence.  Big deal!<br/><br/>DEFINITE SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>1. The film relies on coincidence.  Joe Palantiano's character has the same initials as the rapist. 2. Joe Palantiano is an undercover cop.  Yet, he never tells Pierce after the first killing, even when he knows Pierce could kill him. Certainly, if he is hanging around for the money, he might try looking in the trunk of Pierce's car.  Pierce probably doesn't know it is there. 3. Pierce has false memories which deceive the audience. 4. Dodd, the ""big time"" drug dealer comes alone, even though a HUGE amount of cash is involved.

","It amazes me how many people praise this movie yet still don't get it and fail to grasp the full truth of the story. Because the plot is so complicated in the way it was presented it took my wife and I hours to figure out what really happened. Credit that to the director for having pulled off such an incredible and original movie.   ------WARNING***-----SPOILER AHEAD------------- I have read the last 80 comments on this board and not once did anyone observe that Leonard ALREADY had started his body tatooing before his wife died. In an extremely brief scene at the the end of the movie, Leonard is seen laying in bed half-naked with his wife with a few of his tatoos already on his upper chest. This lead me to the following conclusions. 1. Leonard's wife survived the intruders' attack, though Leonard himself suffered severe head trauma which leads to his handicap. 2. As a result of this affliction, Leonard begins tatooing his body, the results which are seen in the final bedroom scene with his wife. 3. Leonard himself kills his own wife with an insulin overdose and then transposes the deed to Sammy Jarkis. The 'real' Sammy never had a wife according to Teddy. Yet in order to justify his 'revenge', Leonard reminds himself that Sammy was a murderer.   4. Leonard is sent to a mental institution (according to the clues in the official website) and begins plotting the murder of the second assailant in his diary. He then escapes the institution and hooks up with Teddy who helps him find the assailant. Teddy photographs the blood-covered Leonard as a reminder of his nasty deed, knowing full well that Leonard will soon forget and continue his killing rampage. 5. Teddy takes advantage of Leonard's affliction and uses him to kill a drug dealer for monetary gains only to be outsmarted by Leonard when he realizes he was duped by Teddy.<br/><br/>Presumably, Leonard will continue his rampage until the authorities eventually catch up with him and puts him away for life."

Confidential,excels further here in quite possibly the most intelligent,compelling,and twist filled movie of the year.Nothing is certain in the film,it is all told in such a complex and original way that at no point is it predictable or tiresome.Pierce plays a former insurance investigator who due to severe brain damage on the intervention of his wife's murder,is completely unable to piece together events that may have occured much longer than an hour before what he is currently thinking.He relates the current state that is ruining his life to that of a man who's claims he was once called to investigate,who was mucked about by the company on the grounds that his claim was mental,not psyical.The movie transcends between a telephone conversation he is having in a motel room,and long,stretched out events that are to happen later on as the plot thickens.<br/><br/>The movie is so clever and original,and only those who like exterior thrills will really complain about the amount of talking in the movie.For those who like to use their brains to piece events together,this is easily the best film of it's kind since JFK.<br/><br/>Another asset this film has is a haunting soundtrack which plays eeringly throughout the film,adding stridend touches to a film already reveling in puzzling scenarios and tense revalations.This film is truly unique,and,it goes to show once again,sadly,that films like this are always only going to get limited releases in selected cinemas,while big budget,money making eye candy will continue to play us all for mugs.Expand your horizons people,films that tax you like this will always pay off in satisfaction more at the end.*****"

","""Memento"" is fabulous film-making. Writer-Director, Christopher Nolan, creates a world for the audience where we experience the life of his ""hero"", Leonard (Guy Pearce), with more insight than the character himself. Nolan telling the story in a reverse time line (i.e. present to past), his attention to detail, and speculation of the nature of memory make the movie powerful. The movie is truly an amazing viewing experience. Guy Pearce gives a stunning performance as Leonard-- a man who has no short term memory since the murder of his wife, and is seeking vengeance on his wife's murderer. Pearce lends a sense of humanity and sadness to Leonard's quest that is touching. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie is perfect as the mystery woman who is definitely not what she seems to be-- the classic femme fa tale. Carrie-Anne is a versatile and talented actress. Joe Pantoliano is so effective as ""Teddy"", whom according to Leonard, can not be trusted. Nolan just gives us so much to look at in terms of our own lives... the memories we have and the stories we create for ourselves."

","This is by far the greatest work by Chris Nolan. Everything about this particular film is simply astonishing and you could see it from a mile away. The superb writing is out of this world. There is no other movie like Memento, no other movie that could take the audience through such a unique experience. So many emotions are felt throughout this film and still, by the time you've finished it, it will leave you wanting more because that's how great this film is. Not only the writing was perfect, but also the direction part. Nolan did an amazing job in introducing us to this fictional world, that everything felt almost real. The way he combined the black&white scenes with the ""colored"" ones was simply unique. There is nothing like it. Then, the acting was impeccable as well. Although this film might be a bit too difficult to understand for some viewers, there are still a lot of things to enjoy from this experience even if you don't understand the movie completely! As a conclusion, I simply adore and recommend this film with all my heart, because it is without a question one of the greatest and most unique films of all time and this is all thanks to the great Chris Nolan!"

These films are not just great examples in the history of cinema but also simply as gems that open our eyes to new conceptions and languages. It seems to me they are so pure that they can not be copied not even by their very own creators. Memento is surely striking by its famous montage but it is also a revolt against the usual, well-constructed movie form. Nolan here actually goes to the end and he manages to change the way we see films."

","Memento's flashbacks are far more extreme than traditional flashbacks. The opening scene is the equivalent of a normal movie finale: the protagonist shoots the bad guy, but all the shots are shot backwards, such as the falling glasses flying back to the face of the person shot, the pistol jumping off the ground back to the hand of the protagonist, the bullet retracting into the gun chamber, etc. Of course, this technique cannot be applied to the whole film, otherwise who can understand the sound like tape rewind. The film goes back from this refreshing opening scene, paragraph by paragraph, about five minutes at a time, with one or two of the same scenes at the beginning of the first and the end of the second, so that the audience can tie a knot in their heads."

","The director created a ""fragmented"" atmosphere in an unprecedented reverse order, letting the audience deeply experience Lenny's broken life and innerness. We act like detectives like Lenny, looking for the so-called truth in the movie. And the emotion woven in the complex structure makes people unable to be moved. ""If self-deception can make me happy, I choose to live so."" We must give ourselves a reason to survive, otherwise we will be schizophrenic. But those things we insist on may only be illusions in our own illusions. When I woke up, I looked at the ceiling and asked myself: Who am I and why am I here. Then you start to recall, when the fragments of those memories are pieced together piece by piece, a complete and perhaps not objective reality is presented in front of you, are you panic?"

One thing that I kind of felt missing was the ending, I just think we needed to have a clear view on what happened in the first scene of the movie to get some kind of closure."

","""Memento"" is the first major film directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Guy Pearce and Carrie-Ann Moss, based on the short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan.<br/><br/>The film is about a man with short term memory loss, who investigates his wife's murder.<br/><br/>Critically acclaimed director Christopher Nolan is a household name in the film industry, responsible for giving us films like ""The Dark Knight"", ""Interstellar"", ""The Prestige"" and ""Inception"". He is known for telling stories in a non-linear fashion, and revolves around the themes of obsession and memory, and often uses practical effects.<br/><br/>Memento tells a great story of a man obessesed with finding his wife's killer, the mystifying ""John G"". Nolan takes the audience along with Lenny, or as he likes to be called, Leonard (Pearce). The story is such an original concept, combined with the interfering style of editing, how the story plays out from end to beginning. Sections of the film are in black and white, which plays in a linear fashion, while the colour scenes, are non-linear. Original and very clever. This subjective point of view that we have with the character engages the viewers with the story, finding out mysteries as soon as Leonard finds them, being as equally surprised. The film is riddled with tension. As we see what the outcome of the film is, we still don't know how it will play out, always figuring things out with the character.<br/><br/>The prop work is to praised. The idea of Polaroid pictures used for Leonard to remember places and people by is an excellent way to drive the story. Leonard writes the names down, and little notes to go along with them when he does forget, so he has an idea of who they are. The mysterious scratch on Leonard's face is ambiguous. No one knows where it came from.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce is very good in the film, portraying this fractured character, desperate to find the killer. His performance is underrated and should be praised a lot more.<br/><br/>Overall: 8.3/10"

When he was hit by the brain, he had to rely on scattered memories to find and identify another person. Teddy police help Lanny find another murderer, John G, and avenge it, but Lenny doesn't remember him avenging himself. Teddy saw that Lenny couldn't remember, so he used Lenny to help himself. In fact, the hero has been deceiving himself after watching the movie. This sudden consciousness delights the listener mentally. The same story, but different people still have different expressions. I must say that the director is very capable of grasping the emotions of the audience and guiding them correctly."

","Although Nolan directed ""Following"" first, I consider this his debut feature film. I knew right away this artist was going to be special and he has not disappointed to date. This is one of the very best films in the crime / thriller genre. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, settings, editing, score, cinematography and acting. Pearce, Moss and Pantoliano deliver superb performances. Pearce commands the screen. His narration intensifies the mystery as the journey unfolds. The score also plays just as an important role as the characters as it adds to the thrilling and intense tone of the film. The plot revolves around a man named Leonard who is trying to track down the person who raped and murdered his wife. Leonard's main obstacle is he suffers from a rare untreatable form of memory loss. The only way for him to remember anything, even from minutes earlier, is through tatoos and instant photographs. Leonard is accompanied in his quest for vengeance by a man named Teddy who only adds to the mystery. The plot is clever, psychological, gripping, thrilling, violent, duplicitous, phenomenal, brilliant and has a cathartic ending. The plot is conveyed in reverse chronology which I've never seen before and left this viewer guessing until the very end which is actually the beginning. This is a virtuous work of art and one of the best films in it's genre."

Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences ""meet"" at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.<br/><br/>As a SL film for me Memento is unique noir classic with it's unique confusing narrative style which later becomes nolanites favourite in his films with haunting music, context, acting and depth.

It's a mix of naive brilliance, bumbling complexity, and each glance and facial expression is infused with the quest for knowledge and answers, something we can all relate too at some point in our lives.<br/><br/>Memento's main hook of course, if you haven't seen it after all these years, is that the movie is played in reverse, to an extent. The colored scenes are played backwards, representing Leonard's memory struggles. It's really interesting watching a movie like this; the audience becomes armed with information that Leonard forgets as the movie goes on. To Leonard, these colored scenes are advancing normally. It gives the audience the same profoundly limited vantage possessed by Leonard. Leonard cannot remember what happened 5 minutes ago and thus enters every scene ignorant of what has already transpired. Since the movie is told in reverse chronological order, the audience also enters every scene with no idea of what has transpired. If that sounds mind-boggling, that's because it very much is. It makes a lot more sense when you watch the movie, trust me. <br/><br/>The movie also has black-and-white scenes which are played chronologically. Eventually, the b&w scenes and colored scenes overlap. The other major characters, such as Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), highly enrich the experience with their great performances as well. Teddy in particular oozes sleaziness, but as you watch there's a lot more to his character than director Christopher Nolan may initially let on."

","'Memento (2000)' may seem somewhat pedestrian when viewed in the 'right order' as opposed to the way it is actually presented, in reverse, but even then it stands up as a nuanced character study. Its backwards nature is a clever conceit that's more than just a gimmick, though. It's woven into the very nature of the narrative and, as such, one should not be presented without the other. It also comes as a natural extension to the main character, allowing for plenty of unique moments that challenge audience perception. This is essentially the piece's mission statement and it achieves it in full. The characters are beautifully realised, with the protagonist's inner journey coming full circle just as the movie itself does so. 8/10"

"jonah-woodman","10","0","0","25 April 2018"," Film critique (film school credit)
","Memento is a mystery thriller which follows the perspective of the protagonist Leonard Shelby, who is looking for revenge against the people who murdered his wife. During the attack on his wife Leonard suffered an injury resulting in a rare medical condition that does not allow his brain to produce any new short term memory. Other than the memories he has retained before his accident everything else seems to fade over a short period of time, and that produces one of the most entertaining principles in which Leonard's journey is presented throughout this film. 
The story of this film is told on screen in reverse chronological order which may appear as a tacked on gimmick in hopes of receiving more buzz or viewers, however in this case the nonlinear narrative more than just a gimmick in which the story is told but in fact the designing principle of the film and fundamentally adds to the already robust narrative. By developing the story in this style fully immerses the audience to feel the same confusion the protagonist feels throughout the film. This compels the audience to remain engaged to solve answers to the questions director Christopher Nolan expertly stages in every scene of this film, by doing this the director rewards the tedious audience member paying attention to the minor details and subtext within every scene. 
Christopher Nolan has indeed mastered the non linear storytelling, if this feat is not executed correctly this can create a very confusing and discombobulating narrative for the audience. However in this circumstance and with many other Nolan films he's accomplished this non linear story masterfully. 
Another entertaining concept of the movie is the use of colour and black and white scenes. The colour scenes follow the protagonist Leonard Shelby on his current dilema living with his condition and hunting his wife's killer. The Black and white scenes primarily show Leonard speaking on a telephone to a mysterious caller and flashbacks of his life and career experiences that molded him into the character we see in the present colour scenes. Contrasting these reverse chronological colour scenes to the normal chronological black and white scenes gives an amazing perspective to the entire character arc of Leonard Shelby. 
Memento holds a very high entertainment and rewatchable value, and with each view and careful attention the viewer may pick up new details to each scene. Memento gives a fresh unique outlook on the common revenge tale told in many many Hollywood films and is a must own in any film library."

","Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is truly a rare and exceptional achievement in modern film-making in that it manages to be new, fresh, hip, and exciting without ever tiring its audience out - unless you're walking into this film without the desire to participate and actively analyse the mysterious details. If that's the case, then this is DEFINITELY not a movie you should see. If, on the other hand, you are open-minded, creative, and alert, you'll definitely appreciate and get a kick out of this one. ""Memento"" is an old-fashioned ""film noir""-type mystery thriller with an intriguing, ingenious twist: outfitting the entire film with a style that mirrors the protagonist's own mental condition while giving the viewer(s) their own perspective as well. <br/><br/>It is masterfully filmed and edited in such a way that it is chronologically presented backwards (with two initially separate, parallel story lines - the main one, shot in colour, is the chronologically-backwards story with scenes that intercut with those of the other story, which is filmed more like a documentary, shot in black & white, and mostly takes place inside a motel room with the main character narrating, talking about the effects of his condition, etc.) While the average viewer may already be put off by such a complicated, confusing format, it is a very original premise that is well worth the struggle to figure out.<br/><br/>Acting is solid across the board, as is the writing, directing, etc., but special kudos must be extended to the very talented editor Dody Dorn, who successfully managed to put all of these fragments together and help them flow in a smooth, healthy manner that is not easy to pull off.<br/><br/>One of the most ""memorable"" films you're likely to ever see, ""Memento"" is an instant classic due to its ground-breaking narrative style and impressive dramatic undertones. For those jaded moviegoers who seek something to keep them awake, interested, and constantly thinking, there couldn't be a better choice than this film.<br/><br/>Excerpt from ""Movies that Moved with Prakash Silwal https://www.facebook.com/ektafilmsnp/"

","This is the first movie by Christopher Nolan to stand out by the masses and for very good reasons. This film is simply a cult classic, wait scratch that. This movie is a classic period and it accomplishes so much although it's a low budget movie. Movies like this proves that you don't need a large budget in order to make a mesmerizing film that also challenges the audience. This is a film that goes in a reverse order sometimes and it has perfected this formula. And other films soon copied this formula but so far it just wasn't as good as this. People sometimes write stuff down so they won't forget and that element plays a big issue in this movie, cause the protagonist is a very forgetful person. His memory is very fragile and he can only remember very short amount of time. The premise of this movie is intriguing as it can get, which means just about any audience will be grabbed by the mystery of what is really going on. The dialogue is also interesting because of the premise of it all, actually not just that it keeps you thinking. And is another reason why you can't help but pay attention to what is going on although it can come off as ambiguous at times. Christopher Nolan is a good director that can even make a intricate movie like this understandable for the mass majority of audiences. Of course watching it a second time can rehash and make things more clear but it isn't as amazing. But I usually base a review from the first watch and from the first watch this is a amazing mystery movie. Where the puzzle pieces get put together bit by bit in the most interesting way possible. Like any good book or a movie the anticipation is the main drive of this movie and got me hooked from beginning to end.

"fergus35","Null","0","0","14 September 2011"," Memento (1999), a film directed and wrote by the ingenious Christopher and Jonathan Nolan.
","Memento (1999), tells the story of a man named Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) who suffers from short-term memory loss (Leonard is incapable of making new memories). The movie opens with Leonard killing a man named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), and at this early stage of the film we do not have much to go on regarding the motive of this murder. The only clue given is the Polaroid picture of the victim and a brief description of the character on the back. This scene is the first glimpse that we have about the film's disconnected format. The film's main character, Leonard, is trying to find the man who raped and killed his wife. It was during this attack on Leonard's wife that he suffers a blow to his head, resulting in his memory loss condition and the driving force for Leonard in the film.<br/><br/>Memento is centered on the style and structure of the film. The viewer is given vague details in the film, with answers surfacing throughout either earlier or later in the film. The film also introduces two characters, Natalie (Carrie Ann Moss) and Teddy, who seem to assist and scheme against Leonard throughout the movie.<br/><br/>For example, we are shown a blurred photo of Natalie that Leonard keeps with him. At the bottom of the photo we see words that are crossed out; however, we are not told why until later in the film which is when we actually see Leonard writing the note, than scratching it out. One moment we are watching Leonard sitting in a bathroom and the next scene we are watching Leonard run down the street. Pay close attention to the motif (repetition) phrases in the film, such as Leonard's continuous reference to a man named Sammy Jenkins (watch the movie to find out the twist with Sammy).<br/><br/>Leonard never really knows who he can trust and relies on a series of pictures with notes and details that he has had tattooed to his body pertaining to his wife's case. Do not be thrown by these idiosyncrasies, because all good things come to those who wait and the pieces will fall right into place.<br/><br/>Memento is not chronological and frankly I am not sure how great the movie would have been if it was shot in a traditional beginning, middle, and end sequence. The movie incorporates voice-over narration from the mind of Leonard, which helps at time understand what is happening in the film. Viewers that prefer traditional movies may not enjoy this film due to the constant changing of the film's direction. Scenes will repeat, providing the viewer with different relevant information to the plot depending where the viewer is in the film.<br/><br/>If this review has you second guessing watching Memento and if you have never seen a film that incorporates twists and turns, or jumps from present day to future, and back to the past, than I highly suggest starting off with one of the Nolan's later film, such as The Prestige (2006). This film is slightly less complicated in the manner that the film was shot, but still delivers on suspense and twists as well. The Usual Suspects (1995), by director Bryan Singer is another sure bet to prepare you for Memento. Although, I found the storyline from these two films much more interesting than Memento, I still feel that Memento is artistically more challenging."

I eventually realized what the movie was doing but the technique is not the same as what would be experienced by a person with a memory defficiency. <br/><br/>The main character seems to think that murder is entirely justifiable if he considers the person to deserve it. He seems to be a self-appointed assasin. Instead of reporting crimes to the police, the characters simply avoid the police. For me, that philosophy is too strong in the movie and makes it difficult to enjoy. Combine that with the confusion and in my opinion it is not worthwhile."

","I've been hearing the buzz on Memento for some time now.

And guess what, the movie was worth the six hour drive there and the nine dollar ticket price.  During the drive back it was the only thing on my mind, sticking to my brain like gum on the bottom of one's shoe.  I couldn't stop thinking about it.  After the movie ended, everyone in the theatre just remained in their seats to mull over the movie.  This is why it's great filmmaking.  It challenges and engages the audience to look into their own lives and see how it relates to their personal experiences (which is why I loved Fight Club and American Beauty).  It's a philosophical look at memory, reality, and time, things that I've had a great interest in, all blended perfectly into a drink that viewers must sip and not chug in order to understand its complexity.  This is a movie where you can't leave your seats for a drink or a bathroom break (Hell, don't even take your eyes off the screen) because every scene is vital to the comprehension of the whole picture.  If you love a thinking movie and its not playing near you, check your area, pack a bag, and drive to the nearest theatre that it is playing because, I guarantee, that it's all worth it.

I think that he actually deduces this each time.  He knows he can't remember what has just happened, he sees the tattoo on his hand (the only tattoo not normally covered) that says ""Remember Sammy Jankis"".  As Sammy is something he can remember he then deduces that he has tattooed that because he has the same condition.  This may explain the presence of the Sammy scenes. Of course it's very coincidental that he has developed the same rare condition as one of his previous investigations, or is it?

I can't blame these incidents on the morning-after-the-night-before syndrome, so I attribute the decline to one too many blows to the head, but subconsciously cringe because I know in the back of my mind that memory loss is supposed to get worse with age.  At least I think that's what they sayÂ…<br/><br/>Leonard has a condition: after a violent attack in which his wife was killed, and he suffered a brain injury, Leonard was left with the inability to form short-term memories.  To keep track of people, places or things, he takes reams of Polaroids and writes endless notes to himself (some more indelible than others).   This, and the fact that he can never be sure if people are being straight with him, tends to make the search for his wife's killer a tad more difficult.<br/><br/>""Memento"" is one of those films that will, ironically, remind you of many others: it showcases elements of ""The Fugitive"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"" and any number of film noir pieces.  What sets ""Memento"" apart is not it's somewhat fractured timeline, or that it begins at the end, rather it is the total lack of certainty of any aspect of what is unfolding on screen.<br/><br/>""Memento"" plays on the idea that what we remember isn't necessarily what happened: if you ask two people why they were arguing, they may recall the major theme, but will typically remember specific details very differently. This is why police always take eyewitness testimony with a grain of salt, because they realize that recollections are suspect at the best of times. The film never lets you forget that.<br/><br/>The entire premise of the film rests on whether you believe in Leonard's affliction and Guy Pearce leaves you with few doubts - his deft ability to switch from lucidity to blind rage to total confusion is totally convincing. However, although Leonard spends much of his time in a waking-dream-state he is not stunned and is able to focus and process his surroundings, evanescent though they may be (unless recorded).  The supporting cast is equally effective.<br/><br/>Joe Pantoliano is his usually slimy self as Teddy - or is he?  We don't know why Teddy's helping Leonard or if he is.  And Pantoliano is slick enough that the viewer is hard pressed to say if he's a savior or Judas. Carrie-Anne Moss turns in her wordiest performance (even if many of them are four-lettered) yet as a mystery woman/kindred spirit/manipulator.  Again, the viewer is not sure about her character or motivation.  Is there anything the viewer can rely on in this film?  Short answer, yes, but you may not like it.<br/><br/>While the director has gone to great pains to achieve an art-house film feel, there's no hiding the money that went into it.  The film's detailed visuals slick editing and subtle audio clues embedded in the soundtrack all serve to both distract and alert the viewer's attention.  The hard to pin down plot and concerted efforts by the writer to obscure any absolutes, including the inclusion of numerous red herrings requires that you pay strict attention to every detail.  Even then, I don't guarantee you'll catch everything (I know I didn't).<br/><br/>This is a film for anyone who's tired of cookie-cutter plotlines, and wants a little fiber in their film diet.  When it's over, ask your movie buddy for their interpretation, buy tickets for the next screening, and repeat as necessary."

I think I had become numbed to movies after seeing the usual predictable Hollywood trash such as What lies beneath, Erin Berkovich (or whatever), Patriot, etc. This movie riveted me. I haven't seen such a wonderful movie since The Ninth Gate. I am surprised to see it being compared to Fight Club, a movie that I hated.<br/><br/>Memento combines an intelligent story, with suburb acting and spell-binding cinematography. But what is really fantastic is the directing. The opening scene, for example, runs in reverse, teasing you with with a hint of how the movie will develop. The mix of black and white with color is exciting, and the ambiguity of the film makes you identify further with Lenny, the narrator. Everything about this movie is remarkable...but what is even more remarkable is that it is playing in just a handful of US cinemas. In fact, when it opened in NYC, it opened at only four theaters. How this can be, I can not understand.<br/><br/>If you havent seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to see it, and you owe it to your friends to tell them about it. If only the movie industry would crank out movies like Memento the way they crank out movies like The Patriot, Erin Brockovich (or whatever)...."

","To quote the great Keanu Reeves:  ""Whoa"".  Give yourself over to this hypnotic, challenging movie and you'll have a great ride.  Try too hard to figure it out or second guess it, you'll ruin the fun of watching a truly original work unfold.  It's so great to see Guy Pearce in another good role since LA CONFIDENTIAL.  Joe Pantaliono is reliable as always.  And even though the story is told backwards, it still manages to surprise you.  A clever film that doesn't sacrifice the humanity at the heart of the film for cheap shocks, this movie is more than a mere gimmick.  Pearce will truly make you care about this character, rooting for what essentially boils down to a revenge fantasy.  You could poke holes in it all night long, but why bother?  Just lean back and enjoy one of the best mindf***s captured on film."

","I work in a video store.  I assure you that watching as many movies as I do, you begin to tire of repeatedly seeing the same contrived, trite, unoriginal, uninspired films.  Memento was none of these.  Memento was perhaps one of the greatest movies I've ever seen (right next to Pi, Requiem for a Dream, Fight Club, Dreamscape, Pitch Black...etc).  I recommend it to EVERY single person that asks me ""what's a good movie?"", and I get that question a LOT.  Memento was certainly inspired by other movies, that's true, but it added new elements and cinematography that it's predecessors did not have.  Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano come together again after doing the Matrix and they both deliver stellar performances.  Guy Pearce however, was absolutely phenomenal, he was great in ""Rules of Engagement"" and most triumphant in ""Ravenous""...he's slowly becoming one of my favorite actors.  So if you're ever thinking to yourself, ""what's a good movie"" make sure, at least once, to answer with ""MEMENTO""."

","clever is the first thing to come to mind after seeing this movie mystery/thriller.  i knew a little about the premise of the flick since i'm big fans of both guy pearce and carrie anne moss but was still floored at its originality and structure.  i appreciate directors that try to challenge the audience to be a part of the story and try to understand a character's action and situation without having to simplify the process by showing people the obvious.  mr. nolan by doing this has created a world where we are, as the audience, just as confused as the main character, played expertly by pearce.  its no shame to confess that at first viewing i'm still left out in the dark at some points of the story, but i think that is one of the movie's strength is its complexity and its testing of your memory, which in reality is what this movie is all about.  this is not unlike the sixth sense whereas you'll probably need a second viewing to answer all those unclear thoughts in your head and if everything shown connected to everything else.  not to compare the two in story but just the keenness of it and its ability to reflect on what you saw and question it afterward.  any movie that can have you talking about it afterward and immediately wanting to see again for the answers to some questions is well worth the effort.  i believe so and will do so tomorrow."

"nunculus","Null","0","0","17 March 2001"," Man without qualities
","It's undeniably brilliant in a hundred different ways: Christopher Nolan's noir about a man (Guy Pearce) who can't remember anything prior to the last five minutes redefines how a movie creates ""suspense."" Pearce seems to know who he is and what his past is--he just can't ""make new memories."" As if he smoked a monster bowl of skunkweed, Pearce can only recall what has just happened...and just happened...and just happened. To add to the aphasia, Nolan plays the movie backwards, starting at the climax and rewinding. And just to give the audience a real challenge, he splices into this Moebius strip a phone conversation (about another aphasic personality) with an unknown listener--taking place...now? In the past? In a dream?<br/><br/>""That was TOO, MUCH, WORK!"" snorted an irate West Hollywood viewer at the end of MEMENTO. What probably really rankled this fellow was Nolan's ending--which, in a cruel stroke of genius, refuses to pull a cool, orgasm-like, Twilight Zone-style rabbit out of the hat, but instead frustrates all our desires to hear cymbals crashing. The greatest part of Nolan's achievement (based on a short story by his brother Jonathan) is that he has us guessing in new ways. Watching a linear, straightforward, Agatha Christie-style whodunit, we get clues based on a) the facts and b) the twitchy character traits of the suspects. Here, Nolan adds a question mark in regard to the time and the level of reality of any given event--making figuring out the big picture on the fly even more of a brain-twister.<br/><br/>All commendable--and the complexity of MEMENTO, down to the tiniest details, is quite extraordinary. But one must bridle a little bit at seeing film noir turned into a Mondrian canvas, or an Alain Robbe-Grillet novel. Part of the pleasure of the genre--and narrative pleasure is Nolan's real, even outrightly stated subject--is in the human factor..of which MEMENTO has none. Noir is not just about story, it's about politics, psychosexual ooze, generational war, hidden kinks. MEMENTO is a story about story. And for all that it gives you to chew on--like what constitutes a human being when memory is peeled away?--it gives you nothing idiosyncratic and fleshly spilling over.<br/><br/>Also, one shudders a bit at the audition-like quality of the movie. (Nolan is now directing a remake of INSOMNIA with Al Pacino.) Like the too-similar RUN LOLA RUN, and also the works of Darren Aronofsky, MEMENTO has a bit of the feeling of a soft-shoe for the studios. Too bad--because Nolan (maybe Nolans?) is a guy with a big, big brain."

But this is not too migraine inducing, as the director cleverly explains every new twist (which you get every 10 minutes or so) by 'telling' you what part of the narrative you are at.<br/><br/>What you might find the most amazing is that this film brings out several questions; Since he cannot remember anything that happens to him, who can he trust?  Even after he finds his wife's killer and revenges her death, he wouldn't remember it anyway.<br/><br/>At the end of it all (which is the beginning)  everything you thought you knew about the story is laid to waste because...How reliable is YOUR memory anyway?<br/><br/>Chances are you'll be trying to piece it all together months after you've seen it."

","WOW- talk about going through the proverbial looking-glass...jeez, this movie is breathtaking.

It's still with me.  Pearce gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a man with short-term memory loss, who needs a polaroid camera and the written word to constantly remind himself of what and who he is.  Themes of revenge, of guilt, and of hatred are so beautifully intermeshed with some of the most under-appreciated actors in Hollywood today- Carrie-Anne Moss, anyone?- that one leaves the theatre THINKING- this is a THINKING movie (don't get scared), that makes you question every memory you ever had, every experience you ever experienced, and the very life, the reality, you live in.  In that way, I guess, it's like The Matrix, besides the fact that two of the actors who are in that film are also in this one.<br/><br/>I also equate this movie to ""Gladiator"", in the sense that, despite it's early February-2001 release, Pearce's performance is so astoundingly thought-provoking and well-acted that an Oscar-nomination is most likely a SLAM-DUNK for next year's Oscars."

The first image we see after the excellent music of the opening titles by David Julyan is a man with a photograph, we don't know anything about this man or the man on the photograph, still we begin to ask questions.

In Memento he draws you in to Leonard`s own confused state of lack of being able to remember more that one conversation or scene, draws conclusions from the tattoo`s on his body and who he believes as telling the truth as he privately investigates the murder of his wife. Excellently supported by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss who are either aiding or misleading the ""hero"" to the initial outcome, brought together by Christopher Nolan in only his second feature in a first class and unique way by reversing the whole film, so you see Leonard kill a man but cleverly not the reasoning behind it, till you rewind to the beginning of these events.

He tattoos himself, takes numerous photographs and makes notes in order to conduct his life, which is focused on the task of gaining vengeance for her death.<br/><br/>The logic of time suggests that knowing what has happened in the future would help with understanding the past - however, this is a dangerous route to follow in the case of this picture and I was constantly furrowing my brow trying to put into context what I was seeing.  I'd heard of anterograde (apologies if that's a mispelling?) amnesia before from studying Psychology and had seen a documentary about a sufferer, who's wife killed herself because she couldn't cope with the heartache of her husband not remembering her, which gave Memento a real emotional edge for me, and there were some quite poignant moments where Leonard recalls his wife and the intangiables which truly characterise 'knowing' someone..<br/><br/>Guy Pearce (who if he keeps up like this, will never, ever be referred to as 'Mike out of Neighbours' again is good in a difficult role, but the supporting cast are tremendous, especially Joe Pantoliano as Teddy and Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, two of Lenny's 'friends'. <br/><br/>
It's hard to say too much about this without spoiling it, so I'd just recommend anyone to give this a go.. It's certainly not your average run of the mill revenge thriller, but it is engrossing from start to finish and the 2 hours seemed to pass in about half the time!<br/><br/>9/10."

Fairly original premise with interesting development, if you're willing to forgive about one million leaps of credibility. That's right, one should not concentrate on finding possible mistakes in the script or flaws in the overall idea because this film doesn't rely solely on it's convoluted screenplay or a single idea (like for instance The Truman Show did), but also has atmospheric power, good casting and directing (as did for example The Usual Suspects and The 6th Sense).

You can also add ""chilling"", absorbing"", ""surprising"", etc. to that. An incredible work of art and actually a thriller that makes you THINK. Most films have you guessing over ""who did it?"", but this film goes much further than that. It's an exploration of the human mind, of people's motivations too.<br/><br/>Maybe it's a bit too difficult to follow sometimes. There are moments that you really have a hard time remembering what has happened the minutes before. Maybe that's not exactly what you'd expect of a thriller. But after all, I think that's just what the director tried to accomplish here: by telling the story backwards (you have to see it to believe it!), you have just as much trouble following as the main character Leonard, who suffers from some sort of amnesia. (and has no short term memory) And it might as well be that this is one of those rare films that you HAVE to see more than once. Not like THE SIXTH SENSE, where the ending puts everything in a different perspective, but like ... well, like ... I don't know. I think you have to see it for yourself to be able to draw your conclusions. One might forget that right in the middle of all this, is an actor (Guy Pearce) who delivers a truly stunning performance. Pearce starred in PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT and in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and this is another great film he adds to that list. He might not be as big as his L.A. CONFIDENTIAL co-star Russell Crowe, but in his own way, this Guy is going to make it.

","Memento is a film which i will always remember for the feeling i got as i walked out the cinema where i saw it. it was one with a smile, but a feeling which i cannot describe. some films make you go ""wow!"" with wonder, or satisfaction, or just blow you away. This film does all that, but adds incompleteness, and ambiguity to it. An ""ending"" where the facts are unclear, and leaves the viewer in the same state of mind as the central character, might leave some members of the audience unsatisfied. However, i revelled in this and was delighted with the whole experience.<br/><br/>
Guy Pearce made his character his own, and plays the part with great deal of innocence, charm, and humour. His comic timing is surprisingly good. His two co-stars, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Ann Moss, are both very good, and add to the mystery, which unfolds in an interesting structure.<br/><br/>
The people out there who do not like original films, do not like to see films which don't adhere to hollywoods guidelines (i.e. a film starting at the start, ending at the end, with a happy note, and want things to be ""normal"") then be warned: you're most likely not to enjoy this film, because it is different in many respects, and better off because of it.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan is a Britsh director, who with this film is a name to watch out for in the future. Word of mouth is out on this film, and is enjoying a good audience here in Britain. It didnt do too well in America but with Oscar nominations (God willing), should see it do well on video, and DVD. <br/><br/>Memento is a film which i do like a great deal. Watch it, and you will be rewarded but a breathtaking experience."

We share Lenny's problem, only slowly gathering fragments of the whole story as we progress backwards in time, each scene ending where the previous began.<br/><br/>Ingeneous, tormenting, suffocating, with a touch of black humour, this movie demands your attention from start to finish (or is that finish to start?).

","sometimes we re-watch a film because it has a great twist, sometimes because its so complex that we need two viewings to get all that there was to get but mainly we re-watch films because we liked them an awful lot the first time that we see them. Memento is a film that can fall into all three of these categories. This is NOT a roll into the cinema or when it comes out on DVD/Video get the popcorn in and let the film just wash over you. On the contrary, this is a film that demands effort from its viewers and if you are prepared to give that effort then you get an awful lot back in return.<br/><br/>Previous comments have detailed the story and all i would like to add is that this film is a great combination of good direction, great acting (especially Pierce), a good script and a GREAT idea. All great films have all of these attributes, so does Memento.<br/><br/>I just have one request, when this film is released on DVD please make it have an option whereby you can watch the film sequentially in a chronological order. Would it improve the film? probably not, but it would allow you to see a) how clever the idea was in the first place  b) how good the editing was and c) how good the performances were.<br/><br/>P.s. if anybody knows where i can get the soundtrack or the music used in the film please email me!"

You have the vague feeling that you might be watching a movie.<br/><br/>The disjointed story line of ""Memento"" places the viewer in the same uncertain mental space as the protagonist. As each scene opens you are uncertain whether this place should be familiar. How long has this been going on?<br/><br/>Even at the end the facts aren't stable. They are open to interpretation. You piece the puzzle together in the way that makes the most sense even though your senses are ultimately unreliable.<br/><br/>This film offers an effective metaphor for the act of watching film.

Guy Pearce does an incredible job of playing a man who due to an attack on him and his wife, loses his ability to form new memories.<br/><br/>
The way this film is structured is delightfully confusing, taking twists in both style and plot.

When we got home, we compared theories and they were completely different. We saw the same film, in the same theater, at the same time, and yet we interpreted it differently.

It's a movie which not only ignites arguments in the car on the way home, but even among strangers in the theater. Best of all, there are no no special effects, no digitally superimposed monsters, nothing explodes in a fireball, no one falls in slow motion through a window, there are no car chases, runaway vehicles or serial killers. No scene takes place during a thunderstorm. There are no nude scenes for the actress to later complain to interviewers about how tough they were to do. It features no big name stars who can promote the movie on the talk shows. All the actors are over 25, and none are the children of other actors. No one featured in this movie will appear on the cover of People or Vanity Fair. There is no fatuous attempt to delve into important social issues. There are no good guys vs. bad guys -- or are there? Are there?<br/><br/>The name of this movie is ""Memento"" and I urge you to see it at once."

","Best movie I've seen this year or maybe my entire life. I advise you not to read my review or anybody else's if you have not yet seen the movie. The following might contain some SPOILERS. If you are worried about the spoilers and yet still wanna read, just read the very last paragraph :)<br/><br/>Amazingly the movie is played antichronologically. This puts the viewers into the life of Leonard, by not knowing what has happened in the near past, not knowing what has lead him into current situation. I was so absorbed by the film for the two hours, I even had difficulties coping with my real life for a few days.<br/><br/>Directing was excellent. The whole movie showed a unique atmosphere, with its unique music and its stylish art directions. Acting was good but I think the casting of Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss caused too much prejudice (because of The Matrix, ofcourse) about the plot. btw Guy Pearce was just the perfect man for the role.<br/><br/>The movie in whole, is excellent and beautiful yet I found a few minor glitches (goofs). I can understand that Leonard uses photographs to keep the memories after the incident, but how does he remember where he keeps his photographs and his camera (how does he remember the system he is using to remember stuff... like in the scene where he finds some documents about the police investigations and stuff). Also I don't get the part where he writes something like 'she has lost a person too bla bla' on the back of Natalie's photograph, since he couldn't have linked the death of Jimmy with the photograph with Natalie and Jimmy together. Also there is a goof in the goofs section about Leonard knowing he has a memory problem. This condition Leonard is suffering from is called 'anterograde amnesia' and from my short studies of psychology in the past, the people who have this brain problem somehow always know they do have a problem with their memory.<br/><br/>I feel the need of buying the DVD version of this film. This movie has now entered my top ten list :) I especially recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed The Usual Suspects, Tarantino films, and Guy Ritchie films. Must see!!!"

"yadran","Null","0","0","20 April 2001"," A disturbing film
","I found Memento very disturbing.  I could identify with Guy Pearce's character, Leonard Shelby (he hates being called Lenny).  As I think we all can to lesser degrees.  <br/><br/>Leonard's case is extreme however; here he suffers a ""disorder"" where he completely forgets things that happened to him only a few minutes ago. However he remembers himself normally prior to a traumatic event (he remembers his name and where's he from for example).   The uncertainty in what really happened is part of the of story I guess. A major theme of the story is that everyday we all construct our identities from two sources: a)	Memory b)	Our immediate surroundings and context<br/><br/>But what if we have no memory or it is unreliable?  What happens to the view of our self?  Leonard has no lasting memory of anything after his wife's death even though he appears to remember his life before her death with clarity.  His only residual memory or instinct is to seek revenge by killing his wife murderers.<br/><br/>What I found disturbing about this film is that it made me realise that I have made and continue to make profound decisions in my life (eg. whether to accept a new job or form relationships) based on perhaps imperfect or skewed recall of events and emotions as they really happened at the time. <br/><br/>We see that Leonard's life lived within this scenario is harrowing and sad. <br/><br/>But it made me realise that who I am is, at least to some significant degree, a result of the imperfections inherent in my memory: that is, I would be a very different person if my memory was better or worse it is now.<br/><br/>The reverse order in which the story is told, with overlapping scenes is a powerful method of telling a story.  It makes me more conscious of cause and effect.  It made me think much more than if the story was told in linear fashion.<br/><br/>The opening sequences occur in reverse motion.  The rest of the film is shown in short (as little as 1-2 min) colour time sequences in reverse chronological order (that often overlap). Black and white sequences - apparently from in the distant past, some short time after Leonard's wife's murder -  are juxtaposed throughout the film.  But this too, is not obvious to me at least.  Besides this, the filming techniques used are mercifully competent and invisible so as to not distract from the story.<br/><br/>So unlike many films, this film can possibly make us examine and question what it means to be a human.  On how and why we see ourselves in the world as we do.  On what basis do we make decisions to do things as we do?"
"Mr. Pulse","10","0","0","20 April 2001"," A truly engrossing movie
","Time stopped when I watched Memento.  From the first brilliant image I was hooked.  When the movie ended I desperately wanted more.  I had to settle for a lengthy and spirited discussion about it with my friends.  And, of course, I intend to see it again as soon as I can.<br/><br/>You already know more of the plot than you should in order to enjoy this movie, so I won't repeat it.  I will however say that there is more to this movie than the plot, so anyone who laughs it off as a director showing off or a writer using techniques he's borrowed from other films, is wasting their time.  The plot is what the movie is hung on, not the other way around.<br/><br/>The lead characters, Leonard, Teddy, and Natalie, are all superb.  I was completely engrossed by them, and didn't for a second disbelieve my eyes. And that's the key to the movie.<br/><br/>Anything I say about the ending, or even the middle of the film will hinder your enjoyment, so instead I will tell you:  Go see this movie blind.  The less you know the better.  Go in with an open mind and observe.  Take witness for Leonard, since he himself is incapable of doing it.  And try to put the pieces together.  And don't kick yourself when you can't.  In many ways you're not supposed to.<br/><br/>In a year where Hollywood seems to be dumbing down even its dumbest movies, this is a film with enough intelligence for three films.  Its at once a noir, a thriller, a mystery, and a deconstruction of noir, of thrillers, of mysteries, of film.  And it's a flick that is perfectly suited to the DVD format.  I can't wait to get my own copy.  A mind-blowing headtrip of a film."

","Well, first of all, what a film! I have not found this kind of great film for a long time...This film was just superb.  Well, there are many films providing mysterious puzzles right now, but not many movies can link their scenes like this one.  This movie is clear, and yet you can never be sure.<br/><br/>The plot itself was not magnificent...but editing is what makes this movie a must-see.  pieces are well-organized (?), and color of the screen is well chosen.  When Lenny puts Jimmy Grantz's blue shirt and pants, color changes...well, I thought that was brilliant.<br/><br/>Now, if you try to figure it out, it's not that easy to see how things work in this film.  Did Lenny's wife really die?  Does Sam Jankis really exist? Who's Dodd, and what's up with him?  And how can Guy Pearce know that he has a short-term memory problem?  By watching this movie twice or three times, you may solve all these problems or at least come up with every hypothesis. But you don't have to.  Do not really focus on details.  This movie is to confuse you, and you go see the movie to be confused.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce was superb in this movie.  His character was believable.  And he just looks like Leonard Shelby, his voice, his gesture, his facial expression, everything.  I did not really like Carrie-Anne Moss.  She was all right, but she could have been better.  All other characters were good, but no one really stands out.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was brilliant, well worth watching. Rating: 9/10"

","This movie was wildly unique and thus quite difficult to discuss.  The way in which the story was told really messed with traditional concepts of time, storytelling and memory.<br/><br/>One standout feature was the way in which a scene was played out more than once.  At first you'd be shown the scene in the middle of it, time would go forward to the 'conclusion' of the scene.  Then you'd backtrack to before the moment you first stepped in.  A little more context was added and the scene was replayed just enough for you to catch the implications of the additional information given. Despite this backtracking and replaying it was never repetitive.  There was never too much information.<br/><br/>The twists in it were just mindbending, and I'd read some of the spoilers. Nevertheless, watching the truth come out, backwards, was a completely engrossing and startling process.<br/><br/>And the end was perfect.  One second more of film would've been too much. It ends, and you just sort of sit there stunned.  You now have to recall the whole film from start to finish with the new knowledge, the truth that is finally revealed at the start of the story and the end of the movie.<br/><br/>There were two instances where the exposition seemed forced, more for the audience's benefit than because the scene actually warranted it.  One instance where Leonard (the man with a 'photographic' memory as the sign outside the theatre said) seems to hold onto a memory longer than he should've been able.  But three minor hiccups hardly undermine the entirety of the film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.  I'm going to see it again soon."

","The fact that this had a limited release here in the UK is nothing short of criminal.  I can understand that a lot of people wouldnt like this movie, after all with so many of todays films being popcorn entertainment the appeal of a film designed to rock your mind and get you questioning everthing you have seen is limited perhaps. But this is certainly a film you will remember long after you have seen it, there is no short term memory loss in that area. It sucks you in, and just when your comfortable that your beginning to understand and piece together the random pieces of the jigsaw you see on the screen it ties your brain up in knots while you least suspect with one killer twist after another, and while your busy unraveling the knots proceeds to do the same thing again. Even though things apparently start to become clear you soon find out they are not, nothing is as it seems, and you really do thanks to excellent editing get a feel for the kind of condition leonard has. The genius way this film is put together (like i said a huge complex jigsaw) means you see a scene (for example scene A) that has little relevance you think to the plot..... but, nothing is as it seems, and a few minutes later another scene starts (scene C perhaps), but, this scene ends where scene A began earlier. Slowly putting together the pieces. Its difficult to explain and if that confused you i apologise, but thats the way the movie twists and turns along, and this is in no way a criticism.  It really is something that has to be seen to be believed because the way it all fits together from fragments of memory is extremely clever and also very fitting to the premise of the movie and cannot be explained by the viewer, quite simply because they struggled to understand it too, and/or question what they saw or percieved to see. AGHHHH im rambling again, do you see what i mean? Forget the matrix, they should have saved the tagline they used there for this movie. Anyone interested in cinema, anyone who likes to have their minds messed with or appreciates first rate storylines/twists, directing and editing should see this movie. Its a shame this movie isnt more mainstream because it deserves the attention, yet the irony of it is the beauty of this movie is the elements which prevent it being such.

Guy Pierce is captivating, and succeeds completely in drawing you into his disjointed, piecemeal world.  Nothing is as it seems.  As the story is progressively unfurled you find yourself increasingly questioning  things that seemed certain only a few scenes ago.  After viewing the movie, seemingly inconsequential throwaway lines that are easily forgotten at the time subsequently assume critical importance.  And there is also the delicious challenge of ""stepping back"" from Leonard's perception of events to try and absorb the bigger picture.  Who can you believe?

","I saw this movie knowing almost nothing about it. I knew it was told backwards, that's about it. <br/><br/>Hence, I would suggest, to the extent possible, anyone who likes really good movies to see it, and to go in about as much in the dark as possible. That being said, I'd consider anything from about this point on to be a spoiler. <br/><br/>SPOILER for those that like caps. <br/><br/>Yeah, filming a movie in reverse is kind of a gimmick, it certainly was in the Seinfeld episode that used it, though that certainly wasn't the first time it's been employed as a story telling device. <br/><br/>The reason its much more than a gimmick in this film is the basic premise of short term memory loss. We, as viewers, are kind of stuck from the outset in the same way the lead character is stuck. He knows what just happened, but nothing much before that. So as the movie builds backward so to speak, we may learn where this character is going, but we, only through sparse clues provided, figure out where he's been. <br/><br/>Though I think the plot was interesting, if a bit fragmented, it really only serves to heap a lot of deep ideas, one on top of another. The character at one point ponders how long its been since he lost his short term memory--since the last thing he can remember is his wife's death, rather than what happened just moments before. In that regard, the parallel question for the character is whether his long term memories fade? They don't seem to--he seems to have them as vividly as if they indeed happened just the previous day. Also, the character is severely limited--because he can't obtain any new memories, he by nature can't change, or can only do so in limited ways. In that way, he's almost totally the reverse of Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day"" who changes himself in all kinds of ways as time basically goes in a loop (piano, ice sculpture, etc). <br/><br/>This is another reason why the plot device works--we don't see any character development in any forward sense, because the situations don't change him; really the plot going backward helps peel layers off of who Leonard Shelby really is and how he got to the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>More spoilers ahead: There are some interesting ideas--as in the way that he believes he can learn some new things--through habit and routine he can manage his life, but then, how does he remember that he knows that? And then there are some touching moments as in when the character remembers his wife--the last real memory being her side of the bed being cold. <br/><br/>And some funny ones as well--as in when the character can't remember in the middle of an action chase whether he's the one doing the chasing or being chased. <br/><br/>There are some very good elements to the movie--as in the very short clues at the very end of the film, some only flash on the screen--Shelby and his wife laying in bed most importantly. Not to say its perfect, the plot is basically explained in a few minutes by Teddy near the end of the movie, the beginning of the plot progression--but as we all know, he's someone who lies."

","Many things went through my mind as I saw ""Memento"", but the last thing I was thinking about was how ""helpless"" or ""invalid"" diabetics are. Sammy Jankis' wife has her husband give her insulin injections, but that is clearly HER CHOICE. Obviously, she can give herself injections if she has to. Sammy's wife doesn't die because diabetes has made her helpless, but rather because she doesn't believe that his short-term memory loss is a real condition. She gambles that if she asks Sammy to give her another insulin shot after he has ""forgotten"" it, his love for her would snap him out of this condition and her ""old Sammy"" will return. Unfortunately, she's wrong and dies as a result of her gamble. Since it was Leonard's advice that ultimately led her to take this action, he is haunted by her story throughout the film. But none of this would have happened if she gave herself the insulin shots.<br/><br/>I am not an expert in diabetes, but criticism of this film that it demeans diabetics reminds me of Italian-American groups that slam masterpieces like ""The Godfather"", ""GoodFellas"", or ""The Sopranos"" simply because they depict Italian-American characters as gangsters......"

","I usually send in my comments first before I read the other IMDb User Comments. For Memento, pardon the pun, I reversed my practice: I literally read the 100+ comments prior to sending this one in. I have had the same immediate let down feeling towards the way the film ended. Yet I agree with some that it's probably writer-director Christopher Nolan's insight to end it so. I'm glad to know from several user comments that the short-term memory loss situations Lenny and Sammy displayed were clinically authentic. Overall, Memento is this year's filmic experience not to be missed - perhaps NFE (not for everyone), but if you love movies, especially a mind twister, this one is certainly for you.<br/><br/>The progression of the film in reverse order did remind me of director David Jones's Harold Pinter's ""Betrayal"" 1983, also begins at the end (of a 7-year affair) and working its way back to the beginning of the affair as the film ends. The editing fete also reminded me of director Stanley Donen's ""Two for the Road"" 1967, which is a must for movie lovers: it's a journey, going back and forth with the two charming leads, Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn as Mark and Joanna in their mid-life marital crises, where sequence of events is presented in fast forward and rewind modes - a unique film experience.<br/><br/>German writer-director Tom Tykwer's ""Winter Sleepers"" 1997, has a character similar to Lenny, who has a short-term memory, uses a camera to snap and record things that he saw, then develops the film to look at the captured events on photos. The film deals with pairs of characters, multiple storylines that cross each other, as feelings and reactions are fatefully presented - a theme animatedly reinforced in his subsequent ""Run Lola Run"" 1998, which used the approach of repeating the same story thrice but offering different aspects every time. It was successful in having heart and humanity. In Memento, the fact that Lenny has a short-term memory capacity, feelings are hence devoid. The Sammy Jankis episodes did provoke touches of humanity.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce has outdone himself as Lenny here in ""Memento"". It's beyond his already sensitive performance as Captain Boyd, playing opposite Robert Carlyle in director Antonia Bird's ""Ravenous"" 1999, which is another film NFE, no ordinary soldier's tale of 1847 indeed.<br/><br/>If you want to see Joe Pantoliano in a more substantial role than being Teddy here, try the Wachowski (""The Matrix"") brothers' ""Bound"" 1996, playing opposite Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon, as the top sleaze (well, not until Pierce Brosnan in John Boorman's John le Carre's ""The Tailor of Panama"" 2001, took top 'honors' as the ultimate sleazy, swindling, deliciously amoral spy Osnard).<br/><br/>For Carrie-Anne Moss, as a demure woman, not a word of filth (if you can't stand the 5-mins. worth of swearing coming out of her mouth as Natalie here), try director Lasse Hallstrom's ""Chocolat"". She delivered a just as strong performance as the other woman characters (Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin, Judi Dench) in this fairytale of a story, which also has its moral center (or dilemma) lodged in the character she played opposite veteran actor Alfred Molina.<br/><br/>Last year we have Mike Figgis' ""Time Code"", this year we have Christopher Nolan's ""OTNEMEM""."

","Cinema is the the modernist form of art par excellence, and filmmakers rarely find themselves at ease with the deconstructionist practices common to more post-modernist media, such as hypertext or experimental video.<br/><br/>When they do, though, the results are always interesting, and ""Memento"" is but one example. The film (you know it by now if you have read the previous comments and/or seen it) is based on a fragmentation and reversal of time as experienced by somebody with short term memory loss. Beyond the immediate comments on the plot (personally, I think was played out rather well, with the two sequences, one in reverse, the other in forward time that meet at the end in the crucial core of the film), it is impossible not to read this film as an allegory of the fragmentation of intellectual life in the age of Television (with its 1/2 hour time slots), gee-whiz journalism, and all the paraphernalia of our post-modern condition.<br/><br/>

Well instead of seeing another one of these movies this weekend, take a chance a buy a ticket to Memento.<br/><br/>
Why? At the very least, you will probably enjoy this movie and have a good time. Its really not so hard to follow as most people make it out to be. However, my guess is is once you have seen excellence achieved on film (and Memento is certainly an example of this excellence) you will constatly be searching for the next standout movie.

Here goes: Memento is the Latin word for ""I remember"" and that is the point! Leonard Shelby knows exactly who he is, and does a great job fooling everybody that he has anterograde amnesia, including himself by thoroughly throwing himself into the role. This is the story as I see it: Leonard is an insurance investigator in a hateful marriage. He knows Sammy and his story so well that he uses it for his own gain. Leonard's wife is involved with drugs and knows Jimmy, Natalie, and Teddy. Leonard finds out. He hires Dodd to knock off his wife and hit him in the head so that he can fake his amnesia. He plans with Dodd to get the drug money and sets out on his elaborate scheme. And enjoys it to the fullest!!! Tell me I'm wrong.

","""I thought the whole purpose of reading a book is to see what happens next.""<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is probably the best movie, both from a technical perspective and an entertainment perspective, that I have seen in months - maybe years.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys not being spoon-fed while they watch a movie!<br/><br/>Because of the way the story unfolds, the audience is consistantly left partially in the dark about everything that is going on.  Why is Lenny here? How did he get here?  Who exactly is Lenny?  We find out, but not until the end.  Don't even try guessing...okay, you can try.<br/><br/>The last thing Lenny remembers is his wife getting raped and murdered.  He can't remember anything else, and he knows it.  So, he uses tatoos (which is a very significant metaphoric device, since memories are often described as tatoos of the mind) and polaroids to help him seek his revenge.  Lenny writes notes on the back of his polaroids so he knows what to do the next time he reads them - almost training himself.<br/><br/>By playing the chronological order of the film, the director accomplishes 2 things: First, it lets the audience partially experience anterograde amnesia by not allowing us to know what happened before.  Secondly, it totally disorients the audience, because we soon realize through our own experience through cause and effect, that for any particular effect, the cause can be a myriad of different possibilities.  The viewer realizes that it is practically impossible to guess what happened before, yet we still try. Interactive, and keeps everyone at the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano round off the key characters, and their performances are amazing, both actors had to act out the script while keeping a certain sense of ambiguity to their character, which is no easy task.  Think Olivia Willams in ""The Sixth Sense"", acting almost interactively with Willis during the dinner table scene, and you'll know what that's about.<br/><br/>The movie puts Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential) in the lead role as Leonard (Lenny), a person with anterograde amnesia - a condition that prevents him from creating new, or short-term memories, while his long-term memories seem to be intact.  He can remember things that happened years ago, but things that happened 5 minutes ago are lost almost immediately.<br/><br/>The gimmick is simple, actually.  The film plays out in reverse.  The final scene is shown at the beginning of the movie, and each scene after that is what happened before the current scene you are watching.  This even sounds pretty gimmicky, but trust me, it works better than anyone could have imagined.<br/><br/>Going into Memento, I was not sure exactly what to expect from the movie. I've heard a lot of good press, but no details.  I all really knew about the film was the gimmick."

","(*probable spoilers*) I read a review of The Talented Mr Ripley which summed up a large part of that film for me. It said something like, ""It's when he kills that we feel most sorry for him"".  Well Memento's backwards approach doesn't give us that context immediately, but towards the end it has sunk in just how sad this story really is.  In some ways they are alike; stories about people who have little in the way of identity, only iron clad purpose and desire.  They don't know who they are, but they're fairly certain where they have to go (even if deluded on that front as well).  Stories about the manufacturing of truth. <br/><br/>I liked Memento better too.  Despite its depressing basis its not relentlessly sad. Leonard's deadpan narration, ""Now, where was I?"", cry of the perpetually distracted, is pretty funny at times.  And further illustrates what's wrong with him. In fact, pretty much everything about this film does (well, as much as it could for people with brains that can piece together a film).  Many will dismiss it as gimmicky and say the rug is pulled out right at the end.  But it's interesting and entertaining in every way.  Don't miss it.

","**SPOILERS**Memories can't be trusted<br/><br/>New form of cinema lands in the Indie circuit and challenges the mind.<br/><br/>Memento, the hypertext movie of the future, is at times a dark noire about self-destruction and corruption and other moments a backwards journey about a man's search for his dead wife's killer.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie consists of Leonard Shelby (portrayed by Guy Pearce) searching for his wife's killer.  Unfortunately, he has a severe form of anterograde memory dysfunction, which prevents him from forming new memories, so every 15 minutes, his memory is wiped blank, or even less under stress.  To compensate, he takes Polaroid photographs of important events and writes notes on the back of them.  For facts about his wife's death, he tattoos them to his body, so he will never forget.  Added to this are the two supporting characters Natalie (played by Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (played by Joe Pantoliano) who play off Leonard's condition.<br/><br/>Many writers are describing the movie as a MÃ¶bius strip, as one stream of the movie continues forward in time from the not-so-distant past, and the other travels backwards from the current time to thereby meet with the other stream in the middle of the movie, which is simultaneously the end.  Sound confusing?  You haven't seen anything yet, until you've witnessed this movie.  The best way I can think to describe it, is like opening a new book, and starting at the last chapter, skipping forward to the first chapter, then to the 2nd last chapter, until you finally meet in the middle of the book.<br/><br/>The backwards journey through time is used to install the feeling of being lost without memories.  Because it is shot in backward-aligning segments of time, you are exploring each scene anew-missing what happened before-so you are left like Guy Pearce's character Leonard.  This effect is like reviewing a forgotten memory, except that it is shot in colour so it has a feel of a fresh event.   What make this even more interesting are the duplicitous supporting characters that challenge Leonard's reason for being in every scene. The dark noire, shot in black and white, give the impetus for the latter actions though the viewer may not catch this immediately, because unlike Leonard, you get to recompile the movie and form a whole.<br/><br/>After leaving the theatre, my mind was busily connecting the scenes I just witnessed and I couldn't help being impressed by what an amazing movie experience I just had.   I think it's definitely worth your time to explore this movie. === spoiler=============><br/><br/>
=== spoiler=============> One thing i noticed in this page is that is says there's a goof in that the character shouldnt' be able to remember that he has a memory disorder.  But i don't agree, cuz Leonard states several times that people with less severe forms of this disorder can learn through repetition.  I believe he has trained himself through repetition, because he can remember some things -- the flashback's he has verifies this -- and he can work progressively (not starting fresh each time) -- the entire movie is a testament to this.<br/><br/>
And also the fact that he has become what he has, should also confirm this. While Natalie and Teddy (John G.) use Leonard disorder for their own purposes, he ultimately proves that he is better at using himself."
"Eddie C.","Null","0","0","8 April 2001"," A brilliant idea that's masterfully executed.
","""Memento"" opens with the shot of a man holding a photograph of a bloody corpse. As the man shakes the photograph, the image starts to waver and fade, until it becomes the blank image that you initially see when a photo emerges from an instant camera. It becomes clear that this is a sequence shot with high-speed film backwards. Writer-director Christopher Nolan establishes two things right away. The first is the structure of the movie, which will go backwards in time from the murder shown in the opening scene to the moment when that murder becomes inevitable. The second is a visual metaphor for his protagonist's condition: Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is brain damaged and cannot convert short-term memory into long-term memory. Ever since he confronted two burglars who sexually assaulted his wife, any new person, place, or object he encounters fades from his mind like the image you see in the opening scene. This leaves Leonard with a huge handicap because he is determined to kill his wife's murderer.<br/><br/>We don't have to wait long before we see Leonard kill the man he thinks is responsible. In the opening moments of the film, we see Leonard shoot Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) point blank in the back of his head. The initial footage is shown backwards, and then we successively see a short scene that leads up to Teddy's murder. This is followed by another that begins earlier, and the pattern will continue throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan uses this narrative technique to put us in Leonard's state of mind. Like us, he doesn't know what happened earlier. But because WE know the future, we slowly begin to glean how different characters are using Leonard and how he tries to learn the truth about his wife's death.<br/><br/>But there's another reason that Nolan tells the story backwards. Since we know that Leonard is going to kill Teddy, we do not ask ourselves ""whodunit"" as the picture progresses. What we want to know is whether Teddy really is the man who killed Leonard's wife, or is Leonard being set up by someone like seductive bartender Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss)? Nothing is quite like it seems in this mystery, and the viewer has to pay close attention to gather all the clues. Fortunately, it isn't that hard to follow since Nolan punctuates each vignette with a striking visual image. Thus at the conclusion of each scene, we immediately recognize the beginning of the earlier episode, so we know how everything fits together.  (Give credit to cinematographer Wally Phister, who does an outstanding job in this film.) Also, between the episodes we see a flashback of Leonard in a hotel room explaining his situation and the sad story of Sammy Jenkis to a mysterious caller on the telephone. (This sequence is shot in black-and-white to distinguish it from the other scenes.) Not only do we learn more about Leonard's condition in these scenes, but also his guilt for how he treated Jenkins, a man with a similar handicap whom Leonard investigated when he was an insurance claims expert. Sammy Jenkins' story becomes vitally important as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a concept for a movie when you think about it, and Nolan did a very good job directing. But his direction would not have been enough without the terrific performances given by the principles. Guy Pearce (best known for his role in ""L.A. Confidential"") gives a haunting performance of a man who has to constantly reassemble the pieces of his shattered life minute by minute. Carrie-Ann Moss is more than just a pretty face who usually turns up in movies like these, but a very good actress who is alternately both tender and manipulative to Leonard. Joe Pantoliano's loquacious performance as the doomed Teddy is reminiscent of a young Joe Pesci. He almost never stops talking and he often leavens the story with humor. His Teddy seems like a pal, but you're never completely sure how far you should trust him. If there's any justice, all three of these performers will be rewarded with Oscar nominations next year, and Guy Pearce will grab a trophy like his ""L.A. Confidential"" co-stars Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>To sum up, I cannot recommend this movie any more highly than I do. It is not often that I feel compelled to see the same movie twice within 24 hours, but that is the case with ""Memento."" After you see this, you will probably want to discuss the film with other people who have seen the whole film. If that's the case, I urge you to go to the IMDB message forum for ""Memento"", and keep the secret from others who don't want to learn any spoilers prematurely....."

","I have been waiting to watch Memento since I first saw a review for it on Ebert and the Movies, but it wasn't playing at any of my local theatres. This is one of the most stylish, interesting, and well-done movies I have ever seen.  I don't know of any movies that I could really compare it to.  I suppose that if you liked The Game, you will love Memento.  It is similar to The Game in terms of the way the story seems to lead you towards one conclusion then suddenly, and continually, throws a new twist at you.  The story is told in an unconventional manner in terms of chronology.  It begins at the end, and over the course of the movie it alternately flashes back and progress towards the middle.  This seems like the best way to show the viewer the way Leonard experiences his life since his accident.  This is a movie that could probably be watched three times consecutively without being able to grasp everything that has unfolded. This movie is about... It does a excellent job of showing how fragile our memories really are.  After watching half the movie, how clearly do you remember about the first five minutes?  As the story progresses, previous events get a little hazier, harder to recall clearly... I was so excited about this movie that I kept going to the website (www.otnemem.com) to find out about it.  Now that I've seen the movie, I realize that the website is really not about the events that happen during the movie, rather it's an extension of the movies' story into the past and the future.  It gives more insight into what has been going on with Leonard since his injury.  I'd recommend to anyone who has seen the film to check it out.  I was confused about a few things by the end of the movie, and if I had to make any complaint about this film, I actually wish the movie was longer.  The story is so engrossing that I wouldn't mind sitting through another hours' worth of film for more insight into Leonard's condition.  Now I'm going to have to try and wait patiently for Memento to come out on DVD. Please make it a special edition with at least a director's audio commentary."

It's gripping, it's a wonderful story, edited exquisitely.  The use of continually working backwards in time, ending each sequence where the previous began, is brilliant.  I'm sure I'm not the first to mention Hitchcock, but I'm sure he would applaud this film were he around.  In terms of concept, this is better than anything else we've seen in years (yes, even The Usual Suspects).<br/><br/>Where I would not have minded a little extra time spent is at the ending. The filmmakers use the reveal process in a very innovative fashion for the entire film, then wrap it up with a bunch of exposition.  What a letdown!  I could feel our entire audience deflate when Teddy begins his big explanation, and Leonard follows shortly after with his.  I really would have appreciated being SHOWN Leonard's history, instead of being told (why I watch a film as opposed to reading a book).  This is where The Usual Suspects was better:  the ending.  In that movie, the exposition is a feint.<br/><br/>(As my wife pointed out, what makes the exposition at the end particularly disappointing is that it comes from Teddy, who we're not sure we can trust anyways.  For those of us jaded enough to realize that we're in an expository moment, we just take the explanation at face value with a sigh or a groan.  But for some folks, my lovely wife included, she was wrapped up enough in Leonard's story to still mistrust Teddy's explanation.  Thus, she and others end up going ""Hey, wait a minute, you mean NOW he's honest?!"")<br/><br/>Still, a lot - a LOT - to commend.  8/10"

In Michael Mann's ""Heat,""(1995) a cop(Al Pacino) chases a crook (Robert DeNiro) in Los Angeles, with a similar meditative score in the air whenever an important decision is to be made (the tunnel scene near the end for DeNiro.)

(Lenny, anyone?) <br/><br/>    However, even beyond that, we have Todd Haynes' ""Safe""(also 1995 and California), where a suburban housewife (Julianne Moore) suffers a mental/physical breakdown that forces her to flee her surroundings and find the cure.  No one can figure out though whether her condition is medical or psychological.  In that film, an even more solitary, sad, synthesized score hung over her as she tried to figure out her illness.<br/><br/>
    Now here we have Christopher Nolan's ""Memento,"" also set in California, with a main character is convinced he must hunt down his wife's killer, yet simultaneously suffering a total mental breakdown, the cause of which remains uncertain.  Filling so many of his more tender or pivotal moments is this sad, yearning synthesized music, the music of decisions and decay.<br/><br/>
    The film is incredible, and it should be in major theaters, not just urban art theaters.  I'll admit many people won't get it, but there's enough to enjoy and think about here that the plot doesn't have to totally make sense the first time to be a great ride.  (Besides, plot complexity didn't stop people from putting out Mission:Impossibe.)  Moss and Pantoliano do a great job of being dubious friends/foes of Leonard Shelby, and I found Stephen Tobolowsky very poignant as Sammy.<br/><br/>
    However, of course, the star of this movie is Guy Pearce.  If his performance were not so absolutely convincing, the movie would seem very contrived.  As it is, you are so drawn into his world and circumstances that plot twists stop being irritating.  Besides, how many times are we really going to find a movie that heads backward from the end, and still provides a suspenseful mystery and a moving drama? <br/><br/>   I hardly ever write on the IMDB anymore.  I've lost a lot of faith since the multiplexes decided to only put out the most violent, lewd, overwhelming, and sensational pictures in major theatres, avoiding more complex, intriguing works.  (Why are Samuel L. Jackson, Guy Pearce, Ed Harris, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Pierce Brosnan all getting shuffled away to the 'art house?')  I needed to make a trip back for this picture, though.  Give it a look or two: ""Memento"" is a winner."

","Starting with the ending and moving backward, Memento challenges us with its backwards narrative and shows us that things aren't actually what they seem.  Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man without the ability to create new memories.  All he knows is that someone raped and murdered his wife, and he's going to find the man and kill him.  In his quest, he is aided by two characters who may know more than they let on.  Joe Pantoliano's Teddy and Carrie-Anne Moss' Natalie.  Both have reasons for helping Leonard, but we like Leonard, don't really know who to trust.  As the action progresses backwards, we learn more about Leonard and his condition and we learn more about why things happen to Leonard.  To talk about this film would detract from the fun of watching it unfold, (or is it recede?) in front of you.  You think you know what happens, you think you know why Leonard did what he did, but that's only the beginning.  And nothing is what it seems."

In a lot of cases, it will be because they made the mistake of reading too many reviews or visiting the official web site (which IMO introduces 'facts not in evidence' and ruins it).<br/><br/>In any case, here's what I loved most about Memento: it was the first movie I've seen in years that was completely unpredictable. I guessed the ending of The Usual Suspects, and I don't understand why so many people didn't. But anyway. Every time I thought I had things figured out in Memento, I learned I was wrong. Every pre-conceived notion I started out with was shattered by the end. Nothing was what it seemed, though the differences were of varying degrees. I walked out of the theater questioning just about everything and trying to remember how certain elements fit together. I thought about it the rest of the evening on into the night. I love movies that do that to your head.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie was edited with a backward scene order is sheer brilliance, and I don't think the movie could have worked if it had started at the beginning. In each scene, the viewer is trying to put together a puzzle, just like Leonard is. And even though the viewer may ""know"" what comes later, he still doesn't know what's going on right now, or why. There are small clues on Leonard's notes that give us a hint and nothing more. It's the closest we could come to having Leonard's condition - the memories we have of previous scenes are pretty much irrelevant to what is going on in the current scene and we are constantly re-evaluating ""the facts"" in light of new information.

I think the film is haunting, and that would be enough, but when we reach the denouement -- the beginning of the story -- we see that Nolan has something powerful to say about how rage can motivate us to do the things we do.  There's a series of decisions Leonard makes in that scene which he knows he'll forget, and those decisions are recognizably human, and there's some terrific reverberation, particularly to a scene in which Natalie goes out to a car to wait.  Obviously I'm being obtuse, but those who have seen the movie will know what I'm speaking of, and probably agree.

By the end of the movie I got no fulfillment at all, I didn't walk away with a message or even entertained whatsoever. There is just no progression in the film. You start in the beginning, in the middle of the movie you still feel like you're in the beginning, and in the last ten minutes you feel like you're going somewhere, but you literally end up in the beginning. Maybe that's what the director was going for because by the end of the movie I felt like I had the same condition as the main character, but there's something called trying to be too deep, which is what is going on here.

I noticed one or two of mistakes in peoples assessment because they weren't really paying attention (Carry an Moss takes pity on him and helps him after she manipulates him but it's hard to tell because you see the action backward).<br/><br/>This is what the film is about. A man who is constantly forced to trust his instincts and the mistakes and victories that go with that.

"ollywill-08723","5","2","5","24 March 2019"," Cold & mechanical.
","I regrettably have to admit ""Memento"" is easily & without doubt Christopher Nolan's worst film; led by a fascinating concept which is explored masterfully; moulding a story from it which is expertly shot & crafted & the narrative is as clever as you'd expect from this particular filmmaker... BUT it suffers from one MAJOR problem; a total & utter lack of any emotional investment.
Let me explain: typically, audiences follow character's stories as they watch & invest themselves in them as they progress from the beginning to the end; here's the immediate dilemma with ""Memento"" - how on Earth am I meant to care about a character who is literally incapable of progressing in any way?
Our lead is a man who suffers from an inability to create lasting memories & that idea is an undeniably intellectual concept to wrap your head around - not hard to see why it was so appealing to delve into as a writer - but when the character is repeatedly discovering himself & his whereabouts in every consecutive sequence, the 2 hour movie rapidly becomes repetitive & fails to go anywhere remotely interesting...
Every new progression of the plot is predictably led by the regression & reversion of the character to the point where he's back to exactly the same person he was before from the beginning, so there's ultimately no emotional anchor to provide the film with any weight. Hence, the feature starts to feel mechanical & cold, taking one clever step forward & two emotional steps in the opposite direction. By the time the credits roll, you're in no doubt about the inventiveness of those behind it, but it's completely devoid of any aspect which could cause me to give a damn about what's taken place so it's monotonous & inconsequential... Completely dull & overlong.
Probably would've been better as a short film instead."

Despite his condition, Leonard is determined to find his wife's killer.<br/><br/>Of course, the main character has almost no idea what he's doing or why, his sense of time and place fractured by his inability to remember.

It's quite simply a wonderful sleight of hand from Nolan, creating something disturbing and compelling. We are deliberately surprised, confounded and uncertain.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce is tremendous in the central role.

"jackasstrange","10","2","5","22 January 2014"," A dazzling, great and exciting thriller; perhaps the greatest film ever done
","Director Christopher Nolan become known as doing great films, but all this respect that he has nowadays can be given to two films: The Dark Knight, which makes his fame, and Memento, back in the earlier 00s, which make his name. Memento is a class of story-telling, a piece of art. It's a film that you want to watch again and again, because is really that good. This film has some kind of glue, once watched about ten minutes or so, you won't stop. Why? Well, firstly, because the way the story is told. I don't want to enter in details; after all, spoilers really can ruin this film at first watch.<br/><br/>But I can say that IF the goal of the film is make the viewer really feel the character's mind to the point of being confusing while watching the film, I can say that they did very well the job. It's a great puzzle, and the pieces are given in a way that sometimes you think in a way, but then there is another piece given, and you simply change completely your thoughts. Then fine, you think the story is finally going ahead. But, somehow, there is yet a piece missing in the story, and there is when you realize you got completely involved in the story and your mind starts to become confused. I've never been so excited for a film as much as i did when watching Memento. I've watched films with very powerful twists, and films with a very well told story, but in that film, there is like a combo of these two aspects and sure I've never seen nothing like that. It's the best thriller film that I've watched, enough said.<br/><br/>Leonard's quest is so unpredictable, and its even more attenuated with the fact that not only the story has no chronological order, but also with the fact that the story is inter called with another moment of Leonard's life(the sequences which happens in that inter called reality is entirely made in black and white). There is also some of Nolan's trademarks in this film. The slight dark humor in the action scenes and the twists in the end which he became known for are two of them.<br/><br/>Once the cinematic puzzle that this film is gets completed, you realize how pessimist and cruel the film is. The ending is unpredictable, and certainly on par with the buildup made, but it don't leaves anything to be thought or whats or ever. There are really no questions to be asked. This is what is so great about it. Despite being apparently a film with lots of layers, the message that it wants to pass is only one – and is very clever. A metaphor about life, and again, not an optimistic one. And as far as the world looks, this metaphor is – how can I say that? It makes no sense! But okay, I'll try. The metaphor is true. Yes, true. Unfortunately. Obviously, I'll not spoil it, otherwise the entire film would be useless and the experience wouldn't be as great as if you know what this metaphor is beforehand, again, and worthy noting to say: don't look for spoilers about this film. It will ruin it. I've no fear to say that Memento is THE greatest film that I've ever watched, and I expect it to be recognized as the greatest piece of art made in that century. 10/10 #1 on my list of all time favorites"

"doctorsmoothlove","10","2","5","8 April 2008"," Scientific and psychological thriller. Who knew?
","Perhaps some films are best left misunderstood. It increases the chances that the viewer will wish to watch them multiple times. Memento certainly fits this description. It is as cunning and unpredictable as any thriller I've seen, and it is one of the few films that can accurately claim Hitchcock's legacy. With so few films actually requiring audiences to think, Memento is a wonderful respite for those still concerned with the intellectual appeal of cinema.<br/><br/>The film's strongest point is its plot which is both original and endearing. Leonard's investigations occur in color and in reverse chronological order. However, we are first presented with the event occurring in black and white which happens in chronological order. The effects of this plot structuring are exquisite. The film's progression mirrors Leonard's anterograde amnesia. In other words, Nolan tells the film both backwards and forwards simultaneously, thus each depiction of the plot adds believability to the other. Another strong point to the plot is the lack of a new love interest for Leonard. So many would-be-thrillers suffer from the unnecessary relationships which ruin the tension the film attempts to build. Even Hitchcock's films occasionally suffer from this occurrence. I suppose Christopher Nolan deserves even more credit since he wrote the screenplay. Unfortunately, the plot is difficult to follow the first time. Upon future viewings the plot will become clearer and even more satisfying.<br/><br/>The other aspects of the film are obviously less pronounced, however, Guy Pearce does a wonderful job portraying Leonard. If the tattoos on his body are not evidence enough, then the realistic facial expressions and his genuine bewilderment is. This is method acting at its finest. Another way his performance is enhanced is the realistic setting design. The audience is not distracted by a fantastical setting which could have been employed. The room is cluttered and untidy as we would think it to be. The hotel manager takes advantage of Leonard's illness and charges him for two rooms, which only further enhances our relation to the movie. One of the definitive reasons that Memento is so entertaining and effective is that Nolan directs a man suffering with an uncommon disease in such as homely way anyone can sympathize with him and understand his plight.<br/><br/>While Memento isn't the typical thriller, it breathes fresh air into a genre saturated with repetitive Bourne and Ocean's films. With Memento and The Prestige as successful films (I have not yet seen the later), Warner Brothers made a right decision to hand the Batman franchise to Nolan. I hope that his success will continue to revitalize the Dark Knight, but I doubt he will be able to create as intricate a plot as he did in Memento."

No other ""who-dunnit"" film or mystery film that claims to be a puzzling movie - none of them are as puzzling or mysterious as Memento.<br/><br/>The film places the audience member in the shoes of the protagonist: Leonard Shelby (Guy Pierce). He is on a mission to find his wife's murderer. The big problem is that he has short term memory, and he must take notes and leave himself clues to find the man he seeks.<br/><br/>The film tells the story in reverse chronological order. the end of the story is the first thing we witness, and the big twist, the most crucial part of the story which explains countless details, happens at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Confusing at all? you don't know the half of it.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie.

Now let's start this movie review: Imagine having a jigsaw puzzle in hand, and you don't have a clue what completes it. You don't have all the pieces required to finish it. There is no picture in your mind, and you are left to search for your answers. What do you do? To what sounds like a treasure hunt and a jigsaw puzzle combined, add a strong flavor of revenge and you get a masterly movie all set before your home screens! All you need to do is get the DVD and watch it. Maybe over and over again, like I have been doing The movie begins with the end and the end marks the beginning of the story (did I say that right?). Yes, that is how this movie unravels itself. The plot thickens as you move backwards (pun intended) and when all the pieces are slowly knitted together, the beginning (or is it the ending) is quite beautiful.<br/><br/>The alternating between the Black/White and the color every ten minutes or so makes it all the more compelling to watch. And how do you watch this movie? Ideally it should be shown from back to front to understand.<br/><br/>This isn't a murder mystery movie  its more of a thriller that takes so many twists and turns as you move towards the beginning (Oh no, not again. Somebody stop me) that you never get enough of watching it once.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't end telling you what to make of it. You have to draw your own conclusions and decipher your own riddles. When the movie brilliantly closes with the credits, it leaves you wondering about reality and what you had been watching all along.<br/><br/>As you still can't get over Guy Pearce's (the protagonist, Leonard) handsome looks, also note that he has a blank look on his face most of the time. That says it all  he looks helpless. You don't know how to react to his confused state of mind  you get stuck between 3 things  whether to slap him and bring him to shape; or feel pity for him hoping he would recover. The other thing that keeps us interested is how to crack the case. How would he find revenge, and how would he remember it? All confusions and the ""don't trust anybody"" funda psychologically affects us as well as we are left with no choice but to not trust what we see and hear of other characters.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has directed the movie excellently, with an adapted screenplay based on the short story by Jonathan Nolan (are they related?), that keeps us all on the edge of our seats. This movie carries more mystery and as each piece falls in place.<br/><br/>But the first half of the movie makes no sense at all; you really get things moving along only after the removal of the tattoos on Guy's body. Overall, this is not a movie which you will appreciate if you want to watch a fun movie. It needs your attention and you get engrossed in the thick of action.<br/><br/>There are some scenes which could have been done away with, for example, the hotel scene where Pearce calls for an escort, but it all adds up to the confusion, so I am not to complain.<br/><br/>Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie still carries her looks of Matrix, and though there isn't a meaty role in the movie for her, so she does well.<br/><br/>Joe Pantoliano as Teddy steals most of the scenes with his corny jokes and at one point of time, you can't help loving his casual approach to the whole thing.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant, the settings and camera work are good. The music by David Julyan is racy and keeps the pulse ticking faster with every scene. I'm sure I would be hearing a lot of and from him.<br/><br/>Simply for creativity and keeping the adrenaline and brain cells ticking all the time, this movie deserves great accolades. This is an all time classic that I would recommend to test your thought process. If I were to put up an all time list of best movies, this would definitely find its place in the top 25. Rating  8.5/10.<br/><br/>As for the book, if you ever get hold of it, keep me informed!"

"fedor8","Null","2","5","16 September 2007"," This thought-provoking story is nothing for fans of Britney Spears.
","It's always nice to finally come across something original. In this case the unique elements (at least I THINK they're new/unique) is a plot moving in reverse time-wise, and the main character having a chronic short-term memory loss problem. No, the story going backwards has not being handled idiotically like in Philip K. Dick's dumb time-reversal novel (I forget the title); instead, there is a very clever build-up of a mystery plot that will keep you guessing what is real/true right up until the very last scenes. As far as Pierce's short-term memory, that is a fascinating mental problem and it's a wonder that it hasn't been utilized before in film (or has it?). There have been movies about amnesiacs in the past but that is quite different from this affliction.<br/><br/>Writing and especially editing a movie like this must have been a major headache. And to do this in such a way that it isn't confusing for the viewer (unless your name is Paris Hilton or Drew Barrymore) verges on brilliant. The only objection I have is the direction; Nolan fails to create a visual look that would complement the great story. There are some clever ideas/shticks, but there is a lack of mood. Whether this was due to an insufficient budget, I don't know. Had ""Memento"" been made with that Fincher or Coen brothers visual touch, it would have been practically flawless. The cast is good, no complaints there. Maybe Nolan could have shown the attractive-in-an-unusual-way Moss in a more exposing light in the bed scenes; it wouldn't have hurt...<br/><br/>Toward the end it seemed as if nothing will add up satisfactorily; this would have been typical of a thriller. But, as in the brilliant ""Possible Worlds"" (not a thriller, but a mystery), all the loose ends are tied up neatly so that I really don't see any glaring or even minor logic problems here. Maybe a doctor who is an expert on Lenny's affliction may find a few problems in that area, but otherwise the script is very tight, which is extremely RARE in (modern) thrillers. I guess this time around it's substance over style (unlike ""Saw"", for example). It's just a pity that we didn't get substance AND a sufficiently flashy directorial style."

Because of this ""Memento"" is a perfect movie to watch multiple times, every time you will discover a new fact or things like that. The story is told beautifully and highly original with flashbacks and jumps in time.

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","2","5","29 June 2005"," Groundhog Day with murder (spoilers throughout)
","Lenny is kind of like a goldfish. His memory doesn't last too long and he keeps wandering haphazardly from one place to another. However, unlike a goldfish he has a gun and he wants to kill the man that killed his wifewhich is nice.<br/><br/>Memento is a revenge thriller with no hope for catharsis and no hope for the protagonist to lead a fulfilling life after he gains his bloody vengeance. After all, according to Hollywood, once you get your revenge you're free to begin a new rewarding life  a bullet cures all ills. But Lenny is trapped. He's trapped in his own head and in a never-ending quest. Every day is the same. It's Groundhog Day with murder.<br/><br/>What I like most about Memento is how hollow it shows revenge to be. Like most people I'd be more than happy to return violence against me with violence, but despite the desire to right wrongs, all too often it consumes people. Lenny is an extreme example. His injury makes catharsis impossible, ensuring that he's consumed by an unsolvable puzzle, but it also works as a metaphor. Revenge can all too often become people's lives. In the end the need for justice or retribution defines the person  it's all they are  and they get trapped in a viscous cycle. They can't be happy until they get their revenge and if/when they do they cease to have a reason to live.<br/><br/>In light of this, perhaps Lenny has it made. His quest will never end and he'll always have a purpose. But this glib analysis ignores the dark fate that awaits Lenny. He has no chance for happiness, he has no chance to move on and he has no chance of closure. All he'll ever remember will be his wife being killed. But even if he can take a photo and convince himself that he's got his revenge he'll never have a chance to enjoy it after the deed is done. His will be a hollow victory.<br/><br/>However, despite the futility of Lenny's quest, the end of the film is still rather satisfying. Only for a limited time does Lenny have access to all the facts, and rather take away the one thing that gives his life meaning, he gives himself a new puzzle to solve. It's a dark ending and one that finally sheds light on what has come before, but much more than that, it says something quite profound about the human mind and how we manage to survive even when everything is against us. For a brief time Lenny's world is falling apart around him, but rather than allow himself to forget what he's been told, he exploits his own weakness to perpetuate his revenge. The cycle will continue, but in a bizarre, twisted way, justice will be done <br/><br/>One of the biggest surprises in Memento is the strength of Carrie-Ann Moss' performance. The Matrix films didn't really demand too much of her or test her acting skills, so I was pleasantly surprised to see her turn in an excellent performance as the horrid Natalie. Her best scene has to be her verbal assault on Lenny. It's smart, it's bad-mouthed and it had my blood boiling. In a single exchange you see the fallibility of the film's hero. Yes he may be able to write notes and tattoo is body, and he may think he knows the facts, but he can't protect himself against the manipulation of other people. He has no chance to analyse, to ruminate or to read people's character. He can only go on first impressions and the lacklustre notes he makes for himself  everything else is lost. And as he proves with his Sammy Jankis story, he's not as good as he thinks he is when it comes to reading people.<br/><br/>But while Natalie's treatment of Lenny is ruthless, there are hints that she at least has some sympathy for him. For instance, when he talks about his wife she does look rather sorry for him. But then again, perhaps it's nothing. However, although she exploits him to the furthest degree, I don't think that Natalie is a clear-cut villain. I think she does feel sorry for Lenny, but I don't think that she lets that get in the way of her getting her own revenge. (What a perfect crime; getting a person with no memory to kill the person you want dead.) <br/><br/>Stylistically, too, the film is superb. The film opens backwards and with a picture gradually getting fainter. Right from the beginning you're in the character's head. I also like the way that the past is in black and white. It suggests that the past is clear, certain. But as the film progress you realise that this might not be the case. Everything is open to doubt. The memory is incredibly fallible and the only certainty is that Lenny will never be free."
"gen3ric","9","2","5","11 May 2005"," Memento Review (Contains Spoilers)
","When we speak of movies that push the limit, are controversial, and contain layers of meaning, not many can fit the bill. Memento isn't your traditional story in any sense. The first time you see this movie you may be confused and perhaps even frustrated with trying to understand the movie in all it's subtleties. However this movie is wonderfully compelling and full of suspense and surprises. The first and arguably most unique feature is in the way the story is told, completely in reverse. It's not that we watch it in reverse, but we get the chronology of the movie in small segments in reverse order. As far as movies go, Memento touched on issues regarding religion (consequences and actions), philosophy (specifically epistemology and certainly issues in metaphysics), and morality. The main character Lenny (Leonard) we discover to be unique for a few reasons. The most striking is his lack of short-term memory. While many of us can say we have bad short-term memory, Lenny no doubt has it worse. His short-term memory loss is so bad that he must tattoo any important information on his body. With any amount of empathy towards this situation, fear and confusion are immediately feelings of which there is no escape. However, Lenny has no choice, he has to deal with all of this with no one to trust and with no idea who to believe. Lenny suffers from a rare brain disease (or brain damage) from the 'incident'. He tells us of Sammy Jankis, the accountant he came across when he was a claims investigator. Sammy had this same disease where he did not have the ability to create new memories; He had no short-term memory. The most complex tasks were done with ease, as long as he had learned of it before his accident. Lenny tells us that there is a difference between himself and Sammy; He has a reason to live. Sammy on the other hand, had no reason, no system. Within the field of epistemology, testimony and memory are important ideas for the attainment of knowledge. In Lenny's condition, due to his inability to form short-term memory, he must rely on testimony. His reliance on notes, tattoo's, and his specific 'system' as he calls it is the way he has adapted to his condition. Also, because of his condition, the consequences of his actions are of no meaning since he will ultimately forget. He creates his own truth, his own meaning, and his own path. Every time Lenny's memory fades away, he's left in a waking state of forgetfulness. Like after waking up from a bad hangover or a deep sleep, he reorientates himself with where he is, what he is doing, and why he is doing what he is doing. The movie is unique in the way it presents the story. First, we see the end of the movie and we form our own conclusions regarding Lenny, Teddy, and Natalie. Yet slowly, the story jumps back into time, revealing yet another piece of what appears to be the final picture. The director keeps using this technique to keep us in suspense. Aside from the unique way in which this story is told, the simple aesthetics of this film are amazing. Many have classified this as 'film noir' from a previous era in film-making and I would have to agree that they share many elements in common. Yet there are features, such as the way the story is told, that set this apart from its predecessors. While the movie is full of suspense and action, the result of this movie is something that makes us think. We leave the movie with questions of our own, wondering about the true nature of man and how we use people to our own advantage. Certainly we wonder how someone can use another person with a server handicap to murder someone else. Nonetheless, Natalie and Teddy take advantage of Lenny and his condition to further their own interests. Without the ability to remember what we have done, do our actions even have meaning? Lenny said, ""Just because there are things I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless"". He had set out to discover the truth and take revenge for his wife's murder, but slowly the story turns into a direction where you wonder Did this really happen or is this just what someone told me? This movie is without a doubt a well-filmed and well-written story. The elements of surprise and suspense work well to draw the audience into the story and take an interest in the characters. The visual cues (black and white for the film cues and conversations), amazing use of lighting, and the timing of the jumps fit perfectly in with the dark nature of this film. This is without a doubt a wonderful film."

"Michael-Zanoni","10","2","5","14 December 2004"," In its own realm
","Just for all of you who seem to have a problem with this movie, I need you to wake up and smell the coffee. I even saw some person complaining that some people see its better than The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and other instant classics. The problem with these people is that their mind is too closed to see the difference between these movies and a movie like Memento. Memento was shot on a low budget. This means actors like Pacino, etc etc... can not be cast easily. For Pearce, this is one of his best performances, hands down. Also, Pantoliano and Moss deliver a completely unique perspective on characters in any film. The best part about the two is the constant flip flopping of good and evil within them. You never truly get a grasp on whether one is trying to help or hurt Pearce on his ""mission."" And if its realism that people are complaining about (Lenny's condition mainly), go back and check your own favorites for realism, I'm sure not every part is factual and actually possible. With films in the independent genre of film, it is important to keep an open mind, and see what the director and writer(s) have to offer you. The reason they are independent in the first place is to stray from traditional Hollywood production values. Everything the directing, writing, and editing throw into this film has a purpose to the storyline. The performances may not be the best all around (except Pearce), but the story makes up for it. It truly keeps you on your toes and (so cliché in saying this) ""makes you think"" but on a different realm. Not only are you trying to piece together what is happening, but why the person in charge of a certain aspect did it that way. That's all I have to say... if you'd like to have an intelligent conversation about movies, I'm game. Drop me an e-mail. What I can't take is the ignorant bashing movies with low production values (like this one) just because they aren't loaded with millions of dollars worth of actors and special effects. Smell ya later."
"Swift-12","Null","2","5","9 December 2004"," Who are we without memory?
","MEMENTO is a film about a brain-damaged man who cannot retain short-term memories and whose sense of self is limited to whatever longterm memories he'd formed before his injury. Most folk either love it or hate it or are indifferent to it (have I covered all the bases?) but only because they either love or hate or are indifferent ... to GIMMICKY movies. A friend once asked, ""How do you spell GIMMICK backwards? OTNEMEM. But they miss the point -- ""Memento"" is not a mere novelty nor an exercise in backwards narrative. This is an exploration of what it is to be human. What generates a mind, or how does a brain store a mind? How can a person function or an identity be formed if they cannot REMEMBER? In fact, if our brain is creating our mind then what happens to it when we fall into the oblivion of sleep? Perhaps each night we die. And each morning are recreated through the power of regenerative memory. Do concepts like ""soul"" even apply anymore, in this age of neuroscience where we've gained insights into the physiologic and microscopic energies of what makes up a ""thought""? The backwards-chronology narrative is a brilliant device to put the viewer into the protagonist's confusion. But like any mystery, ultimately we are asking ... ""what happens next? and what will the final answer be?"" Returning to my harangue about neuroscience, on one level *any* film or TV show is creating a reality within your mind. At least to the extent that you let yourself get immersed in it. For what is the difference between the true external world about us and some artificial world we tune into? For all that we hear and see is filtered through our senses. The true and the false are all just impressions that we experience, whatever is ""out there"" is separate from us and must be interpreted by us. This is why I think mysteries are such an intriguing genre for most of us. For life itself is a mystery. Our physiologic make-up is constantly probing the world about us and asking, asking, asking ""what's going on out there?"" Therefore it's only natural that a book or movie is going to hook us if we get caught up in the questions, ""what has happened here? Who dunnit? How will it turn out?"" Because subconsciously we are constantly being presented with riddles by our own senses. And in Leonard Shelby we have a character whose senses still create a world about him, except he doesn't possess the means to correctly interpret this reality."
"kaos-23","10","2","5","6 November 2004"," Outstanding, gripping, compelling, thought-provoking
","This is a fascinating film that really lives up to the hype. It raises all sorts of questions about personal identity, memory, guilt, truth, and time: for example, if you commit a murder but do not remember committing it, are you still guilty? What does it mean to be 'the same person' that you were last week, or last year? Memento implicitly raises these questions, in a subtle way, without being heavy-handed in the way that the Matrix is, for example. The real genius of this film is that, while it raises all these issues and is genuinely thought-provoking, it manages at the same time to be a truly entertaining, tense, and compelling thriller.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) who, after a blow to the head, suffers from a neurological condition which means he cannot form new memories. He can only remember things for a few seconds, and then they fade away. This means he has to write himself notes, take Polaroids, and even tattoo himself to try and form some kind of continuity in his life. He has no idea who to trust, where he lives, or even where he was five minutes ago. All of this complicates Leonard's quest in life, which is to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, (and caused his own condition) and take his revenge.<br/><br/>This is a genuine neurological disorder which I had read about in a piece by Dr Oliver Sacks called 'The Lost Mariner', and I was fascinated when i heard there was a film dealing with the subject. I didn't think it would be possible to really depict this condition in a film, so I was amazed by the skill of the director, Christopher Nolan, who really makes you appreciate the tragic and horrific quality of this condition.<br/><br/>It is a stroke of genius on Nolan's part that the film itself runs backwards. Or rather, while each moment of the film runs forwards, we see Leonard's life in a series of small chunks lasting a few minutes, which we see in reversed chronological order. This is an incredible use of film to make you understand the sort of endlessly unknown, frightening world that Leonard lives in. It means the viewer has to make that little bit more effort to understand what is going on, it demands a bit of intelligence and attention. <br/><br/>Unlike most Hollywood films, it's not a simple progression from mystery, to disorder, to the solution. It's more complex than that. When someone comes in and speaks to Leonard, we are in a position like his - we don't know if he has met them before, if they are friend or foe, whether or not they are telling him the truth. <br/><br/>The pace, direction, script, and acting are all outstanding. All three of the leads (Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano) give excellent, gripping performances. I was impressed that the female lead, Natalie (Moss) is not just used as eye-candy or objectified, but is a fully developed and intriguing character (all too rare in Hollywood films). The cinematography is gorgeous, with great use of colour and light to create atmosphere. The music too adds to the tense and gripping nature of this film.<br/><br/>In short, this is one of the best films that I've ever seen, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys films that are a bit different."

He witnesses his wife's murder, however, this fact evolves throughout the film. Lenny has to continually photograph his own life with a Polaroid camera in order to elicit his own memory traces. This is due to the fact that he suffers from anterograde amnesia from the concussion he received during the trauma to his wife. The cinematography is remarkable in that it transitions repeatedly from black and white to color. Neurologically, it is an accurate portrayal of this infirmity. Artistically, it is absorbing to the point that it deserves great praise. The director shows intense insight. The actors all give a convincing performance, and I can highly recommend this movie which is now out on DVD.

","I don't know why I bother with the warning, probably every other commentor has already revealed this: This movie starts at the ending. At first they're quite literally playing the scene backwards, but don't worry they don't keep doing that.<br/><br/>But it's a really neat deal that the movie plays backwards (reverse chronological), starting with a scene at the end of the story and working its way towards the beginning. The main character has a (real) disorder where his hippocampus doesn't work right so he's unable to form new long term memories. Having the movie play from end to start allows us to appreciate *his* perspective on the events of his life as they unfold. I.e., we the viewers are just as in the dark about what he's just done or what's just happened as he is.<br/><br/>This is a really, really incredibly great film. It's got action and suspense, pathos and all that, plus it was just a whole lotta fun to watch. I should mention that it's not the *happiest* story ever told.

I liked the look of it from what I saw on the Trailer and a close friend wouldn't stop talking about it so I was expecting good things but I didn't find a good thing about it at all apart from the acting.  The story is very weak and only intriguing and hyped because of the backward storytelling and even with it in order like the DVD offers its still just ok.<br/><br/>If the story of Memento was told in a linear way then it would have just been average which it is anyway.  I am not picking at it because it is so loved and adored by so many people, I just didn't see what other people did. It didn't even answer questions that needed answering.   The more I was watching the more I expected something to happen but it just seemed to get more dull and less interesting.   I can see why this film is so praised but at the same time it's only because it's filmed definitely.<br/><br/>Ask yourself whether Pulp Fiction would have stood the test of time if the whole story was told in order of plot.  It just would have looked like a series of short stories which it is anyway but isnt seen upon like that.

Because Memento will force the viewer to think, something which should NOT be a chore -- or am I the only one left who actually enjoys a plot which wraps itself around the mind and entices the viewer into constructing a mental maze of plot-lines and ever so cleverly brings us to safely through the twisting and winding walls. This is what story-telling is all about, to take us on a journey which our lives would not allow in reality and thereby escape that reality.<br/><br/>I won't bother to rehash the plot events, for that read another contributor's comments.  Instead let's acknowledge the accomplishments of this film and its cast/crew.<br/><br/>First, the movie begins with the end.  The hero avenges his wife and kills the bad guy.  This is where we would usually go home but with expert ability Nolan keeps us riveted to the screen until the movie's end.<br/><br/>Second, the film has originality.  Enough Said.<br/><br/>Third, each actor and actress does one hell of a job, my hats off to each and every one you, even the small parts, like the hotel clerk, are skillfully played.  I also must make mention of an impressive editing job, which allows the viewers to understand the perspective of our main character.  Ah, like real literature, I thank all those involved for this for I love literature, don't you?<br/><br/>Fou... O who's counting anyway...? The writing is superb with poignant irony and insight into the most interesting side of the human condition -- the dark side.  Lines like;<br/><br/>""I can't remember to forget you.""<br/><br/>""What the last thing you do remember?""  Lenny replies, ""My wife, (pause) dying.""<br/><br/>""Let's see what am I doing. Ah, I'm chasing this guy.""  The guy shoots at Lenny.  ""No, No he is chasing me.""<br/><br/>
I could go on and on but I'll wrap things up with the most important component of any film, and it seems the one nobody seems to address; the theme.  What is this film about?  Remember Lit 101?  The central theme defines the message of the story.  (So what the hell is the theme of die hard anyway?)  Memento, delves into the dark black side of the soul brining us face to face with the part of man which no one talks about; our delusions.  The lies we tell ourselves, although never out loud, which allow us to go on with the daily routine.  Leaving us to wonder, is it our own manipulation which silently drives our motives pulling us towards the eventual outcome like a strong undertow in waist deep water.  In the end this film is about the person you believe yourself to be and how that relates to the person others perceive you to be as defined by your actions. Think about that for a bit and then, as honestly as you can, visualize the differences between these two people.  Which one is really you?<br/><br/>See Memento, this is a movie worth your precious time -- which is the true cost of all movies, money you can get more of, but your time here is truly limited -- remember that the next time you buy tickets to that over-hyped summer block-buster release of Die Lethal Mission Rocky Commando Part XIV.<br/><br/>I give Memento a perfect 10 -- a score I have only given twice in a long career as a devout media-slave.  (I was programmed early so I rebel with words and I am hard to please).<br/><br/>Thank you for your time ---   Tymelord"

","Anyone who says that this movie is good should be punished to watch it twice; this movie is bad and ultimately unsatisfying – who could possibly stand this double torture? Memento (2000) is a failed experiment with motion pictures (these experiments with motion pictures begun in the late 1880s). However, there is also the excitement when an experiment goes wrong and yet you discover something no one else has discovered before: you give to an ignorant audience of moviegoers something they don't know what to do about it and this same crowd will be endless fascinated figuring out what it is. This film should be distributed worldwide for free in a - how to cut a movie back in place editing software package - for laptop dudes."
"dbdumonteil","Null","3","10","17 October 2003"," A movie easy to admire but difficult to like!
","Anyone who is fond of detective films will eager to watch ""Memento"". Besides, at first sight, Christopher Nolan's movie is alluring thanks to the story. Indeed, the story of the movie is worthy of any detective film and this is the kind of story that several directors who are past masters in suspense (Hitchcock of course) wouldn't repudiate at all.<br/><br/>This is the story of a man Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) which the woman has been killed. You can guess it easily: his first intention is to track down the killer back and it's not an easy job. It's all the more difficult as he's got a big problem: he suffers from amnesia. Will he succeed in tracking down the murderer?<br/><br/>But this is where things are getting difficult: the story is told upside down! At the beginning of the movie we know the murderer and during the movie we must discover his motive. But with such a device, it's very difficult to follow the story because it obeys a logic that is completely unusual in a movie. And this logic is likely to slip the spectator's attention. It happened with me.<br/><br/>In 1997, when U2 launched their album ""Pop"", ""Rolling Stone"" said that it was an album easy to admire but difficult to appreciate. The same critic could be said for ""Memento"". It remains an original movie but it also demands a big intellectual effort and it's perhaps due to this that the movie was a relative commercial failure. Nonetheless, congratulations to Christopher Nolan who managed to make such a movie that exploits very well recurring themas in detective films. For example, amnesia."
"TxMike","Null","3","11","14 September 2001"," ""Must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun."" (Leonard)
","SPOILERS - The most amazing thing about ""Memento"" is how it tricked almost 50% of IMDB users to rate it ""10"", and currently include it in the top 10 of movies all-time!  What a crock. I guess many are easily impressed by a novel film-editing technique. Reminds me of the early hoopla over ""The Blair Witch Project."" Having said that, the film certainly is engrossing and entertaining, and I applaud the writer/director/editor for trying something so new.  I rate ""Memento"" 8 of 10, but you have to see it on DVD with the extras to understand it. <br/><br/>Leonard (Guy Pearce) is what the director terms an ""unreliable narrator"", because he cannot form new memories after his injury during his wife's attack. So, what we see during the film is what Leonard believes is reality. In truth, Leonard has escaped from the mental hospital to find and kill ""Jimmy G."" We learn that he has killed one man he thought was his wife's murderer, wears his clothes, drives his car, all the while reasoning that these were his all along. At one point he is asked, ""Where do you think you got that car? And those clothes? Is that what you used to wear to work?"" Leonard answered, ""Sure, we get paid a good salary, I must have bought those.""<br/><br/>So, with new clothes, car, and residence in a motel (so the movie doesn't end prematurely with his capture at home), and polaroid pictures of each so he can remember the next hour, he forgets about the dead man and resumes his hunt for the killer, which he does and is depicted in the opening scene. The rest of the movie is the backwards unfolding of what happened between the two killings. Who knows how many could have come before, and how many after. ""Memento"" just is a snapshot in the life of this crazy man, and we are never given a time reference, whether the story covered days, weeks, or months.<br/><br/>It is important to realize the story is told ""unreliably"" from Leonard's point of view. Thus, it doesn't matter what the Joe P. and Carrie-Ann Moss characters really were. It doesn't even matter whether there was one or two attackers of his wife, or even if she really was killed by attackers, or by Leonard giving her too many insulin shots. The movie was simply a study of a person's thought process and decision-making with the handicap he had at that point in his life.<br/><br/>Ultimately the writer/director does not want his audience to take all this too seriously. He calls it a ""film noir"". It is an exercise in interesting film-making. He even sprinkles in humor throughout.  Like the scene where he and another guy were engaged in a chase and Leonard says, ""I wonder why I'm chasing him.  OH! He's chasing me!""<br/><br/>Good flick.  Rated absurdly high...and you can take that to the bank!"
"smellyDonutt","2","2","6","29 February 2020"," Don't waste your time. It's a whole lot of NOTHING.
","This movie is 113 minutes of pure boredom and irritation. The story is frustrating, no empathy is evoked for the main character. The ""oh so revered plot line"" serves as a bore, and makes the viewer extremely impatient. The plot line is stretched far too long and the disappointing ""plot twist"" ending neither does amend nor makes up for the fluff the writers made throughout the movie. This film is like a popcorn bag, which keeps getting bigger and bigger, and then by the end, it pops open, and there is no popcorn inside, just kernels. That is this movie. A bag of kernels."
"pasi-typpo","5","2","6","21 December 2019"," Wake up, folks!
","Now, after watching the movie second time in 2019 I must conclude: a highly over-rated one trick pony. Maybe it's time, maybe it's me, but this movie is not worth 8+ points in IMDB - not even near. The plot and screenplay is confusing, the acting is fine, but nothing too special there. Please accept my apologizes, but this is average at its' best. Sorry."
"abdunbar","2","2","6","11 January 2013"," Entirely Mediocre
","I have absolutely no idea why people rate this movie as highly as they do. Not only is Pearce's acting altogether wooden, the ""try"" level here is so over-the-top and self-conscious it's pathetic: TRYING to be suspenseful, TRYING to be smart, TRYING to keep your attention, but utterly failing at every point. By minute 30 of this sorry film, my mind had already been wandering for 20 minutes. In fact, I didn't even finish this movie. I skipped to the last five minutes, just to see how it would end, and again, found myself yawning. What a boring, self-important piece if there ever was one. Do yourself a favour and skip it."
"spiny__norman","10","2","6","29 March 2005"," possibly my perfect film
","What can I say - my fave film of all time. I sat down to watch with a few spare hours and a dose of flu. By the time it had finished and mates/hubby returned from pub, I was forced to grab them by the scruff of the neck and make them to watch it. The point of view is superb, giving us just a little more info with each scene, confusing the mind with a backwards timeline while suffusing the whole with a forward facing timeline shot through it, using black and white to delineate the ""right"" time line. If you guess the riddle before the final scene, you are obviously suited to working as a policeman, or maybe Hercule Poirot.<br/><br/>Each time I watch it I see another hint that I should have seen the first time, or the second, a detail that makes sense only now I know the answer. Gut pearce as our hero is superbly ethereal and really seems to make you feel what it would be like to make no new memories. <br/><br/>Now, where was I?"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","2","6","23 January 2005"," Unique, brilliant and deep
","Ever since I first heard of this film, I was intrigued and wanted to find out if it was really pulled off as well as everyone said. Incredibly enough, despite how sky-high my expectations were for this film, I was pleasantly surprised and my expectations were definitely exceeded. As you probably already know, this whole film runs 'backwards'... meaning that you start by seeing the end, and then go all the way back to the beginning. There's a line in the film that perfectly states the immediate thought that just about anyone has about this idea when they first hear it: ""I always thought the joy of reading a book is not knowing what happens next."" A reasonable assumption, but not always a true one. Especially not when it comes to this film. Because every single scene, up to (but not including) the very last one, starts with the ending of the next one, and ends with the beginning of the previous one. This makes the mystery even more elusive and adds more intensity to the thriller portions of the film. The brilliant and unique reverse time-line is perfectly explained by the main characters condition. This is the best film I've seen in quite a while, and I can't argue with its position on the top 250(as I'm writing this, it's #20). While some might think it's just a typical mystery-thriller with a non-linear time-line thrown in, but it's so much more than that. Like another reviewer points out, it's not what you say, but how you say it. Between every scene in the backwards moving time-line, there is one in black and white that follows a normal time-line. This is great as a break from the scenes moving towards something you already know, and makes the mystery even harder to figure out. The great thing about this film is, not only do we experience the same confusion that the main character does, but we also find out the truth, which he learns at the beginning of the story, at the end of the film. With it comes some nice observations and truths, which I'll let you discover for yourself. I won't jot down the plot here; read a quick summary somewhere or just watch the film and find out about it. I might ruin the surprise for you, a crime greater than most. Everyone deserves to see this film and discover all of it for themselves. I will say, though, that it's brilliant. The pacing is excellent, you're never bored and you never lose interest. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written and credible. Do yourself a favor; know as little about this film as possible. Don't ask anyone about it, don't read about it. Just rent it and watch it, you won't regret it. I recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate fine film-making, but I suppose fans of mysteries, thrillers and/or dramas might enjoy it more than people who aren't interested in those genres. I do suggest that everyone should at least consider this film. 10/10"
"weibing","Null","2","6","7 January 2005"," Good, but not that good.
","You know what? The movie looks like a puzzle to me at first, intriguing actually. But after I saw through its plot making, I just began not to like it so much as before. It is indeed a novelty in film-making, but not so great, definitely shouldn't be ranked in the top 250.<br/><br/>A movie should not be a IQ test. On the contrary, it is actually a complex of IQ and EQ, and EQ should be a little bit, or even much, more than IQ. And, by the way, plus a little surprise, of course. That is the meaning a movie is supposed to have, enjoyable and then inspiring. The movie, however, looks like a total IQ test for me, just like you run windows XP on a tiny computer with only 64k basic memory, you know. Then what can you do? Just to watch the poor machine take in and out data like brain twitching, continuously opening new swap files on its tiny malfunctioning undersized RAM, on and off, again and again. When you finally understand this trick, it turns out a little repellent, even disgusting. And just when you understand this, it comes to you all of sudden that this trick is really nothing, not artistic but really childish, perhaps most suitable for an IQ-hungry self-righteous high school mind. Because except the simple IQ test, you can not find the critical elements a movie is supposed to acquire, well, you can name it, after all.<br/><br/>Of course, it is not a bad movie at all, but not that good anyway."
"svetaaniston","6","2","6","24 December 2004"," A solid ride, but not the brilliant stuff I expected
","This movie is actually just a regular thriller: you expect to be thrilled, to have a suspenseful movie, full of twists and plots, and you get it. It's nothing more and nothing less. Yes, the plot and the way it's told (backwards) is clever, but hey, so was 'the butler did it' once. Face it: ALL plots in thrillers are clever in some way or another. That's no reason to call the movie brilliant. It takes more than that. A brilliant movie is a movie that tells you something about the world, about people, about yourself. This movie just tells you a nice story. It's well-made, well-acted, and well-thought-out. Although some stuff is really too hard to believe. But it doesn't matter as long as you're just expecting a solid ride, not a life-changing experience. By the way, there have been many movies and books which are told backwards. This movie is nothing new in this respect. <br/><br/>OT: For example, read the book 'Time's Arrow' by Martin Amis. It's a story about WWII told backwards. The good thing there is that it gives you new insights about history of events and of how people thought during the war."

"TheCheeseMaster","5","1","2","16 April 2020"," Simple story told in an overly complicated, ridiculously long way
","This movie tries to be complex, but instead of achieving it by means of a clever plot, it creates a fake complexity through a messy editing. It presents the story through half scenes shown in a mixed chronological order so that the trick to follow it is to ""remember"" (get it?) everything and put the pieces together in a way that it makes sense.
The thing is, maybe you're not up to play a memory game for two hours, maybe you just want to watch a movie, and if you don't play along you end up just watching stuff happen.
This chronology puzzle can be entertaining at first but it quickly becomes monotonous and boring, it's two hours of nealy identical scenarios and dialogs repeated over and over again, and by the time you have all the pieces to put everything together, you simply don't care anymore because all you want is for the movie to end.<br/><br/>Lastly, the protagonist's condition on which the story relies on is too far-fetched for my suspension of disbelief to handle (don't worry, not a spoiler): a person with brain trauma that left him with an impaired short them memory and is unable to make new memories. Someone with such condition should be barely able to function in every day life without a care-taker, but being independent to such degree? And the most obvious question, how does he remember he has such condition in the first place?"

The meaning of life is also based on a series of memories. Memory defines who I am, the purpose of life, and the meaning of life. It's really terrifying, even if Lenny accidentally commits a regret for life, he can only make up another story as a reason to survive. The most horrible thing is not that we will build countless lies to satisfy the truth that we believe more, but that the memories we believe are just the 'facts' that we have processed. In any case, we always need a goal to drive us to survive, but when that 'memory' is just to satisfy the story that we built, when everything is not reliable, then what else can we believe?"

I thought it took a little too long to get there and was repetitive in its overlapping bits, so I got a little less caught up in the cleverness of it all than others. Part of me felt it was too contrived, and part of me wondered why the main character didn't just take copious notes rather than scrawl single lines on photos and tattoo himself, or better yet, shoot videos of himself. How could he be functional on his own, driving, etc in this state? How does he even remember that he has a memory problem? The reverse story-telling is intricate, maybe too much so, or maybe some of it was just lost on me.

Basically, Leonard Shelby has this incident when his wife is getting raped and murdered by two brutal attackers, Leonard hears her screams from the bathroom rushes in and tries to fight them off, but ends up getting his head smashed into a glass mirror, and then supposedly they leave. The story is that Leonard's wife survives, she is diagnosed with diabetes and he keeps injecting her with a needle but he forgets (due to his amnesia) that he is overdosing her with the drug, and she ends up dying of an overdose. Altogether, the story is original, unique and anything you would hope for in a psychological thriller.<br/><br/>Even though the story is quite dark, there is a humour to it. For example, character Teddy is hilarious, making jokes about Leonard's condition. Overall, this is my favorite psychological thriller by far! Grade: A+"

That's what I felt when I reached that scene, I thought it's another one of ""those"" sequences and there's gonna be another ""before"" scene but then I checked the run time and it was 5 mins to the end of the movie and I was like ""oh I guess this is it, this is the final twist and the truth about the whole story.""<br/><br/>But that's just how I felt, it's not something inherently wrong with the movie.

To be honest the movie was very good. Unique style of narrating the movies makes it special and its not that hard to grasp as well. And the story is just beautiful.

","Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" will change your perspective on how stories can be told. Being adapted from a short story his brother wrote, ""Memento Mori"", Nolan takes the story and warps it into a completely different experience. With the use of time manipulation and perspective, the viewer is forced into being immersed in this enigmatic tale. 
The story is about Leonard (Guy Pearce), a man who is looking to avenge his wife's murder. After being injured the night of his wife's death, Leonard lost the ability to form new memories making this day the last he can remember. The film starts with the image of a fading polaroid followed by the killing of a man played in reverse. The rest of the scenes are played forwards, while the chronology of most of the film remains in reverse, foreshadowed by the opening scene.
I feel that it's important to explain how the film's timeline works so I can reference it more easily. Throughout the film Nolan cleverly uses two main timelines, as well as flashbacks that happen before the main story to maintain immersion. The first being the main timeline which is being told backwards, and the second being a timeline that is being told forwards. The way that Christopher Nolan explained the timeline was by thinking of it as ""hairpin"" where the timelines meet each other at the end of the film. Scenes chronologically reversed (the main scenes) were played in color and were significantly longer than the sections played chronologically (the alternate scenes), which were played in black in white.
The use of color change here is notable because it creates a contrast that keeps the viewer's attention and makes it more obvious when timeline change occurs. As the film progresses, the main scenes were cut up evenly by the alternate scenes. Nolan made the scenes switch back and forth throughout the film while mixing in some of the other flashbacks when they fit the best. I believe this was done to add rhythm and keep the audience's focus. To get rid of any potential confusion about the chronology, Nolan made each the main scenes and the alternate scenes overlap where they were cut so the audience would know right where they are in the story. However, with how complex this timeline is, the film may not be the right choice for someone who likes stories with more of an external conflict.
To accompany the manipulation of time, perspective is used in ""Memento"" to filter information the same way that Hitchcock does in ""Rear Window"". Very few parts of the story are not told through the eyes of Leonard, which, due to his condition, makes the audience unsure of what exactly is happening throughout the film. In ""Rear Window"", Hitchcock lets you develop your own opinion on the events that are happening because you are seeing the film through the eyes of the main characters. This same theory applies to ""Memento"" in the way that if you saw the movie through Teddy's (Joe Pantoliano) eyes, or any other character, you would have a completely different film where Leonard would probably look more directly like an irrational person and maybe even the antagonist. 
While digesting the movie you must consider the smaller aspects that Nolan felt appropriate to add. For example, when Leonard tries to push the door rather than pull when walking into the Discount Inn a certain aspect of comedy is created. Also, the drastic change in sound whenever the wife's murder is being shown adds an aspect of horror to the film. These smaller details scattered throughout the film make viewers that may have not been entertained by the main aspects of the movie, have some relatability with the film. 
When you combine time manipulation, use of perspective, and Leonard's short-term memory loss, you get the final product. If you are a fan of stories with an internal conflict and a complex plot you are bound to find entertainment here. Even though this film might not be for everyone, the experience is unforgettably unique and will leave anyone thinking for days after you watch it. Every time you watch this film your opinions change, and you notice more and more depth in places you couldn't imagine."
"masimone-11709","5","1","2","22 September 2018"," Captivating yet frustrating
","I did find this film intriguing as it draws you into the plot in pieces. However by the end you begin to realize that some of these pieces really don't fit together, not to mention that none of the characters are remotely likable, so ultimately you end up feeling gypped and disappointed with something that seemed to have great potential. 
And can someone please explain to me how Carrie Anne Moss' character was not the least bit suspicious when simultaneously her boyfriend went missing and a stranger showed up at her bar driving her boyfriend's car and wearing her boyfriend's clothes? Instead she was able to sympathize with him because they had both lost someone. For a film that is trying to pride itself on being clever there are far too many moments like this for it to be believable."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Memento is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Guy Pierce. Guy Pierce plays an investigator called Leonard as he tries to find his wife's killer. Leonard cannot form any new memories as he embarks on this quest. It is this disability that causes Leonard to come into contention with characters that knew him in the past.<br/><br/>Memento requires the audience to be patient as the beginning of the movie can appear convoluted. The movie is edited in a way to not play the scenes in chronological order. The movie also interplays flashbacks of Leonard before his condition and of an old insurance case he investigated. The movie wants the audience to stay but it is difficult to continue if they are not interested in the mystery. The mystery is fun to follow and many plot elements that are introduced in the opening scene is followed up by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Memento is not a complicated movie, but it is told in a complicated way. With the backwards narrative to allow the audience to journey through Leonard's condition, the audience can relate to the confusion of Leonard. They can also form an overall narrative for the movie. The audience can judge each of the characters that Leonard interacts with by remembering key details of what he says. Memento is still flowed, but its gimmick of a backwards narrative is still engaging.<br/><br/>I would recommend Memento to any mystery thriller fan.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"micahbundy","10","1","2","12 February 2018"," Masterpiece in Reverse
","Memento is written and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film follows Leonard (Guy Pearce), who is trying to track down the man that murdered and raped his wife. However, he struggles with this due to his reoccurring short-term memory loss. He copes with this by writing everything that he deems important, on photos and on his body. He does this in an effort to find out who killed his wife. <br/><br/>The best aspect of the film is how you are thrown into Leonard's shoes, while part of this is due to Guy Pearce's great performance, this is mostly due to director Christoper Nolan's brilliance in writing and directing. He does this by using repetition and telling the story in reverse. <br/><br/>This film uses repetition very effectively. Leonard constantly suffers from his short-term memory and has to remind himself of what his life looks like after the event that causes his short-term memory loss. He does this by checking his pictures and his writing to see what he drives, where he lives, what clues he has, and which people are a part of his life, as well as how he feels about these people. Like I said, the film does this a lot, putting emphasis on his condition. This, as well as Pearce's performance, makes the condition extremely believable. <br/><br/>The film is brilliantly told in reverse. As the film progresses backwards, not only is more revealed about Leonard's character, but just as much is revealed about the characters around him. What kind of a person they are, what their motivations are, and why they're involved in the life of someone like Leonard. It feels like peeling an onion, each time the film works its way backwards, we get another layer of these characters around him. This is done well throughout the course of this film and makes their motivations and their role in Leonard's life clear by the end of the film. <br/><br/>As these characters around him develop, a question is posed. Who killed Leonard's wife? During the beginning of the film, there is a prime suspect with an overwhelming amount of evidence for this question. But as the film goes on, this becomes unclear and more characters are thrown into the mix. As the characters develop they also become part of the list of suspects. This creates a feeling of uncertainty throughout the course of the film, which makes the film addictive and fun to figure out.<br/><br/>Another great aspect of this film is how it creates a question during the film and quickly answer itself as the film works its way backwards. This helps you put the clues together and gets you that much closer to solving the murder. The film does this a lot and the sequences are short and choppy. Although, halfway through the film there is a particular sequence that drags on and I ended up forgetting what question I was trying to answer in the first place. Fortunately, the film picks back up after this. <br/><br/>Overall, Memento is an excellent film. It's brilliantly written and directed. Nolan does a great job of putting you in Leonard's shoes, which makes the film addictive. Guy Pearce gives a great performance, that is complimented by the supporting actors who are well written and have great character development. This film is one of a kind and makes for an easy: 10/10"

","Memento"" in my opinion is legendary director Christopher Nolan's best film I have ever seen, and one of my favorite films of all time. The film commands multiple viewings, as one does not pick up everything from only one watch. Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man coping with short-term memory loss and centers his life around his need to avenge his wife's death. ""Memento"" contains one of the most dazzling scripts of any movie I have ever seen, and also contributes amazing acting performances by almost all actors involved. The story is extremely difficult to understand as obvious time shifts occur, and it is only up to the viewer to keep up (scenes being in color and shifts to scenes being in black and white). It's definitely a mystery and is in the 4th gen of film noir. I would call it art, and I would call it unprecedented, but those not willing to fully engage themselves into a confusing watching experience will dislike it completely. ""Memento"" is an unforgettable journey through a man's mind."
"tomhowell-68543","9","1","2","5 January 2018"," Film Review - Memento (2000)
","Rating: 9/10
A singular effort from Nolan, who pens and helms his second feature-length film, Memento is the ultimate non-linear thriller, dolling out moments of cinematic excellence. Its only criticism is an unavoidable one, at times flirting with the edges of being puzzling and unclear.
Starring Guy Pearce, Memento, in its simplest terms, chronicles Leonard's experiences as he wrestles with short-term memory loss whilst trying to uncover the identity of his wife's killer. 
In the interest of not completely alienating too many audience members, Nolan deploys the use of a black and white colour scale to signify flashbacks and breaks from the chronology of the story. One instance where this is extremely effective is in the Sammy Jankis anecdotes, where we are given insights into the condition of memory loss and hints towards the main character's own condition and the possible motivations for his actions. The cinematography, while simple, is vital to the structure of the story and to the audience's emotional investment. These scenes are also filled close ups, with Stephen Tobolowsky's facial expressions superbly depicting fear and confusion, and ultimately inspiring empathy from the audience, as the film approaches an emotional crescendo.
Loud noises, such as doors slamming, also give structural cues to the audience as to when Guy Pearce's heart-broken amnesic Leonard's current cycle of memory ends, and consequently when a new one begins. This, while helping the audience to make sense of each scene, also adds a significant dramatic effect by punctuating each scene, usually indicating rising action.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nolan subtly draws sympathy for Leonard through the angling of several shots. Above, we can see how Carrie-Anne Moss is looking down on Leonard, as the audience has also recently been endowed with the knowledge that she has been taking advantage of him. It is subtleties such as these that Nolan expertly equips that make this film as engrossing as it is smart.
Delivered using a structure that is as non-linear as humanly possible, there are at times when this film feels slightly - for want of a better word - jumbled. Granted that making a palatable summer blockbuster was the least of Nolan's concerns, while some reveals and twists are made to feel more grandiose and therefore more emotionally impacting, countless comments of 'I didn't get it' can hardly be met with surprise. 
Christopher Nolan's second feature is packed with cinematic trickery, and will no doubt leave viewers leaving with more questions than they arrived with. You get the sense that, like many sophomore entries - Pulp Fiction being an obvious example - this is a filmmaker's film. 
Despite, or because of this, Memento is not to be missed. It is a structural triumph, challenging and demanding your full attention, just falling short of ranking amongst the most rewarding of watches out there."

9/10"
"elicopperman","9","1","2","20 December 2017"," Confusing and Complicated? Yes. Thought Provoking and Unique? Absolutely.
","Before his days of Batman, Inception and Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan started off making low budget independent neo-noir crime dramas. The one that kickstarted his acclaimed career however is a movie based on a short story from his brother Jonathan called Memento. Praised by critics and audiences upon its release, this movie became so beloved across the world that Nolan himself even got an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay (as well as Best Editing for Dody Dorn), and watching the movie recently, it really holds up as a complex unconventional crime story.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on a man with short term memory loss named Leonard. Some criminals made him amnesic by knocking him out, but they also killed his wife which causes Leonard to search endlessly for who they were by using Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track down information he soon forgets. Basic enough narrative, yet the movie is presented in two different ways. One is a conventional series of black-and-white flashbacks where the other is an unconventional series of color sequences shown in reverse chronological order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist), while still completing a cohesive albeit complex narrative. <br/><br/>While it can turn off some viewers, the innovative structure is bound to really capture ones interest in the story to see what led to Leonard's conclusion on the person who murdered his wife and ruined his life. The puzzle pieces connect together well and there's never one moment where the viewer is not curious to wonder what's the cause of each individual moment. Thus, the narrative is confusing, but it makes sense because we are living in the mind set of Leonard, and considering how forgetful he is while trying to solve the case, it fits the complicated albeit gripping path Leonard goes through that lets the audience relate and sympathize with him.<br/><br/>Along with a story that will constantly have viewers guessing, the characters also keep on track. Even though he is stuck in his own mind, Leonard has no choice since the few decent memories he has left are what lead him to finding the cause of the murderer, thus making him worth rooting for and feel sorry for. You want him to succeed in his task, but you also wish he could just seek the proper help to make him function better in the world. Along with a tightly stellar performance by Guy Pierce, Leonard embodies both the intellectual anti hero and the troublesome victim in his endless search to avenge his late loved one.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are all obstacles for Leonard in his search, whether it be helping him, being supportive from flashbacks, or being straight up offenders. The supporters like Natalie and Teddy are good supporting characters, but they also have their own dilemmas of their own which either shape Leonard or conflict with him. The offenders like Dodd and Jimmy have their tendencies to get rid of Leonard for trying to seek his revenge, but their presence one further brings Leonard to wonder if they killed his wife or not. Add on great performances from Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Larry Holden and you've got a cast that you won't want to forget about anytime soon.<br/><br/>Personally, I think this could be Nolan's best work alongside The Prestige. When you work independently on a low budget, you tend to be more creative and improvisational with your work since you can only work with so much, and Memento is the perfect mesh of a thrilling script that will always keep the viewer guessing and relying more on brisk cinematography and psychological momentum than big budget practical effects and a grim style. Christopher Nolan kept me guessing throughout the feature without going overboard with the story, and he'll keep you guessing the more times you watch it. Check out Memento on Netflix and get ready for a nonstop thrill ride that will cause you to think the whole way through."

","Long term memory is not reliable, our brain may alter what we originally see. This is a fact. As long term memory may be modified and altered, we don't care about the way things start in this movie. This is the sequence in color, the one we live as a character: Inmerse in a subjective reality (We become a part of the movie). Meanwhile the black and white sequence runs forward, in an objective perspective, completely torn apart from the reality in which we develop our judgments. The scene in which the tattoo ""John G Killed"" my wife appears on the chest of our main character while he rests beside her, is a color scene. We are now able to suspect he is the true killer. Visually, C. Nolan encourages us to embrace our main character's memories as not reliable, as they belong to a subjective reality. ""Memories can be distorted"" ""They're just an interpretation"" Reminded me of the famous Henry Molaison case in psychology, got me thinking what life would be like if the unreliable constructs of my memory became my whole reality."

'' This film challenges us to follow in detail a complex theme where it follows an incomparable time line like never before, the main character suffers from a strange illness that prevents him from being able to remember things in the short term, all this happens after a serious accident where he loses everything, now, seeks the redemption and vengeance he so desires to find the culprit of his misfortunes.<br/><br/>Here, the way we are told the story is simply incredible. With the main theme in mind being the '' Amnesia ''. Nolan makes us feel as if we ourselves were suffering from this disease, with each clue and every sequence, it seems that we forget something, it seems that it is us who try to seek revenge, it is something incredible, where it puts us inside the flesh of someone with a terrible curse, forget everything and remember nothing.

"harleyneiditz","7","1","2","15 March 2017"," A brilliant, unique, frustrating film.
","Memento concerns Leonard Shelby, (a great performance by Guy Pearce) a man who suffers from short term memory loss. This leaves him unable to form new memories. Director Christopher Nolan puts us inside the mind of Leonard by giving the film a non-linear structure. This brilliant choice is at times a double edged sword. The non- linear time-line makes the viewer as clueless as Leonard Shelby. We don't know what has happened, when it happened, etc. I give Nolan chops for making that choice. I think it gives Memento its unique quality. On the other hand, the jumping back and forth does not allow Leonard Shelby to develop as a character. As I think more about this, it is actually brilliant. As a character who cannot form new memories, there is no reason for Leonard to have a character arc. The audience member is deprived of the same things as Leonard: closure, understanding, relief. This is definitely a film to see more than once. I bet that I will appreciate it more after viewing it another time. Meanwhile, watch, enjoy, and go along for the ride. Let Christopher Nolan play with your mind like silly putty."
"Maladjusted_1","7","1","2","9 October 2015"," The remarkable narrative of 'Memento' is unfortunately framed around unremarkable characters.
","I've always had a problem with Christopher Nolan's films: I struggle to appreciate his characters. The incredible experiences in which Matthew McConaughey's Cooper ('Interstellar'), Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb ('Inception') and Guy Pearce's Leonard ('Memento') find themselves often accentuate their inability to appear convincing, real, and therefore human. I understand that when a protagonist is designed with no short-term memory (as 'Memento''s is), painting a vivid narrative portrait of him is no easy task; knowing this didn't improve my experience of the film, though. Although I didn't relate to or care for Leonard or indeed any of the other characters of 'Memento', I still gave it a favourable rating, and this is why: The narrative style employed by Nolan in this film truly is something to behold, and it is imposed in a manner which prevents it from being arbitrary or superficial. I'll say no more, as interpreting and coming to terms with the storytelling of 'Memento' was quite rewarding, and I implore you not to check any synopses prior to viewing the film. Whilst the technical aspects of the title are great (I'm chiefly thinking of the editing), I repeat my point about not really being able to invest in the content of Nolan's world. Perhaps I'm a philistine for preferring other ""lost identity"" titles such as Denis Villeneuve's 'Enemy' and Brad Anderson's 'The Machinist', but Nolan certainly makes 'Memento' a unique experience."

","Memento is a film starring Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential, Iron Man 3, Hurt Locker), Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix, Chocolat, Disturbia) and Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, The Fugitive, Bad Boys II). It is written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar) and it is based off his brother Jonathon Nolan's (Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Interstellar) short story, Memento Mori.<br/><br/>Memento is a psychological mystery/thriller about a Leonard (Guy Pearce) who cannot make new memories on the hunt for the person who raped and murdered his wife. He leaves himself notes all over himself and has tattoos that all have information on the man he is after. Along the way, he befriends Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) but are they really his friends?<br/><br/>What ultimately makes this film so good is the writing. It is told in a way I have never seen before and it is so creative and smart I wish I thought of it first. Since Leonard cannot make new memories and we are seeing the story told through his eyes the only way to give us the information Leonard has is to tell the story backward. This doesn't mean it is like a tape being rewound and you can't make out what the characters are saying. It is told scene by scene by scene so the first scene is really the last scene and the last scene is really the first scene. So when a scene begins and Leonard is in a place he does not know with people he does not know, the viewer has no idea where he is and who he is with either. It is wildly creative. <br/><br/>With such an innovative way to tell a story like you would need to edit it in such a way where while it doesn't make sense, it does make sense. The editing does this perfectly where things don't make sense deliberately, unlike sometimes where the editing is so sloppy you can't tell what is going on even in a linear story.<br/><br/>This film is a great one if you really want to challenge your mind and try to guess the ending (or the beginning) before you make it there. This film is great the first time since you are trying to figure it all out, the second time it is also interesting because you are trying to pick up all the things you missed. However, after that the film can never get better than the first time you saw it. In summary this is a film everyone should watch mainly because of Christopher Nolan's brilliant writing."
"schroeder-gustavo","8","1","2","5 June 2015"," Great Original Thriller
","Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors working today. I have yet to see two of his earlier films but I can say that until this day he has yet to disappoint. Memento is oozing with originality and demands to be seen more than once, which brings me to one of the ""flaws"" of the movie. The thing about the film is that when you finish it, you will want to watch it again to put the pieces of the puzzle together, but once you do that is pretty much it. A second viewing of the film does not enrich the experience, the characters don't get better like in better Nolan films like The Dark Knight and really all you do is understand the plot better. Another flaw the movie has is I wish they would have explained the nature of Pierce's condition a little bit more thoroughly. Overall, though this is a great thriller that is definitely worth checking out."
"fil-nik09","7","1","2","15 March 2015"," Quite Good
","Well, I spent the last hour searching the internet and reading questions and answers about the film here on the site.<br/><br/>I saw the movie yesterday evening and still can not figure out what actually happened and I wonder if what I believe happened is actually true.<br/><br/>So, yes, I guess like the others said and wrote, this movie is good that it makes you think or makes you identify with the leading role. But seeing that so many people are not sure what to believe, kinda makes you feel that the movie has served is purpose as a talking point!<br/><br/>For me, actually, the most confusing part is the role of Natalie in the film. 3 different scenes show her in 3 different lights - which one is correct or all 3 are made up?!<br/><br/>And the beginning of the film... I thought at first it is kinda boring that they repeat the same scenes (with just a minute of longer action than the previous scene) several times with only a bit of a change...but then, at the end, I realized that the beginning of the film is the most important ( or so I seem to think)<br/><br/>All in all, good film! I was hesitant between 7 or 8, but I go with 7. It may be the good thing that we are in the dark just like the main character of the movie, but somehow I did not like that much. I like all things to be clear to me. But again, it is really good movie!"

","This movie is like a beautiful person, who everyone agrees is beautiful, but only some would date. It is a matter of taste. I loved the action, mystery, and drama in this film. I loved the original plot and phenomenal acting. But I don't like movies that lack a protagonist. I don't like movies about bad people doing bad things for the rest of their lives. I like to see at least one good person, who does the right thing, and achieves justice in some form at the end. What ever happened to the universal theme of good vs. evil? Do Americans just want to see evil? Is there an evil trend going on that I wasn't informed of? This movie would have gotten a 10 if it had a happy ending, or even a happy anything. Movies that start and end with wickedness are not my thing."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","2","9 March 2014"," Memorable for its audacity
","Back in 2000, Christopher Nolan's name meant little to the average moviegoer. Long before blockbusters like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"", Nolan made his first big splash with an independent feature by the name of ""Memento"". Its inventive storytelling techniques breathed new life into the mystery genre, particularly the tired trope of a character suffering from amnesia.<br/><br/>In Nolan's film, the protagonist, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), is sort of an amnesiac in reverse. Injured while preventing a robbery that left his wife dead, Leonard's short-term memory has been seriously impaired but his long-term memory is intact. Intent on revenge, he must deal with this considerable handicap while hunting down his wife's murderer.<br/><br/>The twist on the oft-used amnesia theme is only the beginning of the film's inventiveness, though. The narrative structure audaciously puts the viewer in the shoes of the protagonist by alternating between scenes proceeding both backward and forward in time. The forward-progressing scenes are mostly expository in nature while the backward-progressing scenes are more plot-oriented. The trick is that as the plot unfolds (in reverse) we're no more aware of the preceding events than the protagonist. While somewhat disorienting at first (which is partly the point), before long piecing together the mystery becomes second nature.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly capable but I don't know if I'd necessarily single anyone out. Guy Pearce perhaps deserves the most credit for convincingly playing Leonard, which is easily the most challenging part in the picture.<br/><br/>As far as the film's technical aspects go, I feel that they are also ably handled but not truly exceptional on their own. I find it unsurprising that the film's two Oscar nominations came for editing and original screenplay since these are the two elements most responsible for the film's uniqueness.<br/><br/>Regardless of the film's perceived strengths, I can say for certain that ""Memento"" isn't for everyone. You definitely need to pay attention in order to make sense of the plot and, even then, you may find the narrative structure a little too disorienting. Add to that the fact that the ending is subject to interpretation and you have elements that some viewers are liable to regard in an unfavourable light. Thus, those who count on a linear narrative with a pat resolution should avoid this movie at all costs but for anyone else it ought to provide a unique viewing experience. Personally, I think that Nolan and company did a remarkable job of delivering on this ambitious concept, particularly given the low budget."
"AaronCapenBanner","7","1","2","31 August 2013"," Puzzling Non-Linear Film.
","Christopher Nolan directs this truly original, mesmerizing, though puzzling film featuring Guy Pearce as a man suffering from amnesia, who, along with assistance from co-stars Joey Pantoliano & Carrie Ann Moss, try to unravel his identity, and the events that led up to his amnesia, though they may wish they hadn't...<br/><br/>I couldn't give away the secret even if I wanted too, since the film is densely plotted, being revealed layer by layer, with the events told and retold so frequently, that it may be hard to figure it out after only one viewing, so multiple viewings are a must, even though one can take only so much of it at a time! Nonetheless, a most intriguing and fascinating experiment, worthy of Alfred Hitchcock!"
"Arakuss","7","1","2","27 August 2013"," Good but not Great
","This is my first review here. I just watched Memento last night and was looking at other reviews. I might not have wrote my own but there are way to many people just over rating this movie. Yes was a it good to watch yea. Unique sort of. I know this film was made a while back but the backward story telling or puzzle story telling has been done before. Many have sighted Pulp Fiction. This is just a story telling tool and whether it has been done before or not is not the point. Was it done well. Yes. It also suited the getting into the POV of the main characters head. For this the movie was very well done.<br/><br/>As far as acting it is hard to grade for me. Short scenes leave little chance to truly show off what talent may or may not be there. Over all you do get a sense of the chars but its really just a superficial view of them. I think this was done on purpose by the film maker to hide what comes next. Did the actors fit their roles yes but they fit their roles for the moment. The moment of each scene. You see what they are like in that moment in time before who they really are is revealed. This works for the first half the movie and once you figure out things they seem more like actors just saying lines. <br/><br/>The true trick or gimmick is not the backward story telling but the fact that every scene... wait spoiler... is built upon illusions and lies. From the very first scenes on is all a series of lies and illusions. This is what actually is very well done and different, because even in lies there is truth. However by the time you get half way through the movie you already figured out where these lies will lead and how they lead back to the first scene. To me there was no major plot twist it was just now following the trail to see how it plays out. This to me is were the film begins to lag and no longer holds any suspense. <br/><br/>Two thoughts on this. One is that really in the end the actual story was a weak plot. There was nothing to the story but questions. This could be what the film maker wanted. What is real what is not. Who is not telling the truth who is. Or maybe they are all telling a bit of the truth. Maybe its Leonard who is not facing the truth. That the truth is to hard to face so he creates his own. Or that the world is nothing but the lies which we want to believe. Maybe a mix of it all. OK so it makes you think but I was thinking this half way through the movie. We do get hints that maybe the Leonard and Sammy are one but nothings really answered. Leonard manipulates his world by what he wants to believe by writing it down. Others manipulate him into believing things are not what they seem.<br/><br/>It is the ending which I believe is the let down. We are filled with not only the suppose twist with Teddy and what he tells Leonard but we are left with who is telling the truth. All we are left with is that Leonard actually doesn't want to know the truth. This leaves the viewer sitting through 2 hours of film that from the very start the main char is seeking the truth that he never really wants to know in the end. He killed the only one who perhaps knew the truth at the start of the movie. How ironic.<br/><br/>One more note. My opinion is the black and white scenes are Leonard's lies he is creating to hide what happened and the color scenes are the lies or half truths the world is showing him. Otherwise he remembers his lies or what he wants to and the color scenes is what the world unveils to him. He reconstructs his world with what he writes down. Unique, different but I would not say brilliant. Good beginning but fades and becomes predictable in the end. You realize the question the film maker is asking and that he isn't going to tell you half way through the film. Writing for first half 10 second half 6. Plot 7. Did it keep me on the edge. 5 Overall I give it a 7 because I liked it. Its is a movie you have to see once just not the type I would see again. To me that is what makes a movie great is wanting to see it again."
"BooChanan","10","1","2","28 April 2013"," Not very fulfilling
","Memento was the film that really got Christopher Nolan noticed and it is my personal favorite of his films, just because it is so unique. It uses a non-linear structure that Nolan has used in a lot of his films and gives it a very dark, tense theme. The structure is reverse-chronological and, therefore, means that the film starts at the end of the story and end at the beginning. But what makes this particular use of it so spectacular is that, for the whole film, you know that the film is going to end with the beginning but, as you reach it, Nolan pulls all certainty away from you; leaving you craving for more. This film is not very fulfilling due to the structure - the viewer still wants to see more - and that's what makes it such a memorable film. Nolan's directing skills aren't the only great feature of this film. His script is also stunning. It involves the main character, Guy Pearse, talking to himself but, almost, addressing us; allowing us into his head. Guy Pearse's acting is superb, portraying all the emotions that his character would have. The rest of the (rather small) cast are also great and help to give the viewer the uncertainty that makes this film so great.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan took on a tricky idea to make a good film of and executed it in a very clever way. A film that should be seen by any Nolan fan or wannabe-director. 10/10"
"raphaklopper","10","1","2","16 April 2013"," Nolan = Genius!
","Memento is one of those movies that will make you be thinking about for days and days. The film is a puzzle very clever and original that will have you guessing from start to finish, and beyond. The story and direction are the best, the way that Christopher Nolan account and directs the film is amazing.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby, a man who lost his short-term memory in a robbery where his wife was raped and murdered, now he is looking for the killer, despite his mental disability that makes you lose memory after every conversation he has. Simple as that. You do not need to know more.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put on the skin of Leonard Shelby, wonderfully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives a performance equally mysterious and complex.<br/><br/>This movie is well done all the way around - the direction, the editing, and especially that the original story is superb, everything is different from what we have seen. From start to finish the film grabs you physically and mentally, to one of the best endings ever made."
"tjclarke01","10","1","2","21 March 2013"," One of the most incredible films ever made
","This film is honestly one of the greatest ever to come out of a film studio . The film Memento is mind-bending, keeping the viewer on the edge of their seats until the credits and another star quality that Memento has is that it can lead the viewer through plot twist after plot twist and still keep the viewer entertained until the last moments. Memento is about Leonard Shelby and thats pretty much all you'll ever know for definite about it. Yes that's how confusing it is until the very last, dying moments of the film. The script is great ( again the genius of Christopher and Jonathan Nolan ), the cast delivers on every aspect , Guy Pearce was brilliant as Leonard , Carrie Ann Moss also was very good as Trinity but the best performance of the film and one of the greatest performances in film history, Joe Pantoliano as Teddy Gammell. I was surprised that Memento was only nominated for two academy awards because I can tell you it was worth more. Overall, Memento is like a complex jigsaw puzzle that you can try to solve but just can't and it just leads up to an incredible twist ending that no one ( not even me ) could figure out . So if you haven't seen Memento you really don't know what your missing!"

","Though this movie felt slow to some, I felt it was paced perfectly. From the telling of his past through flashbacks and explanation of his condition, information was conveyed well and cleverly.<br/><br/>Also well done was the sequence of alternating scenes. I felt this was truly genius, as it gave some sense to what otherwise could have been a convoluted mess.<br/><br/>I felt the tone, feeling, loss, and sorrow in the movie were portrayed well and you could really get a feel of his emotions.<br/><br/>Lastly, I felt the twist at the end where we find out his wife survived and he actually killed her with insulin was great and made sense. The overarching theme of rather living a meaningful lie than a sad truth rings true to many people - it is the choice of a happy lie instead of a sad truth. The Matrix explored this a bit, but I felt Memento gave a much more stark, realistic, and sad telling of this in where a man chooses a lie instead of the truth."
"Ashthx32","10","1","2","10 January 2013"," Memory
","If you're looking for something intense, suspenseful, and different than your usual effects- packed thriller, this is the best movie you will see all year. You will be talking about Memento at work, at the grocery store (to total strangers!), and you will find yourself joining conversations when you hear the word ""Memento."" That's why this little film that received almost no marketing stayed in theaters for months and was in the top 10 money makers for several weeks. The main character has short term memory loss, can remember things before the accident, but everything after, he can only remember for a few minutes. He tries everything he can to remember things, from taking Polaroid pictures of where his apartment is to tattooing messages to himself on his body. The story was a very intriguing one all by itself, but the way the film was presented was even better. I don't think I have ever seen a movie do such a good job of making the audience feel like they couldn't remember anything either. Usually if you are watching, you know what happens before, so memory isn't an issue, but here, your memory doesn't help you very much."
"The-Revenant-of-IMDb","5","1","2","9 January 2013"," 'Meh'mento
","A man with no short term memory must remember so many things in order to find his wife's killer, the same person responsible for causing his short term memory loss.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce fittingly becomes lost in the emotional role of Leonard, a role filled with confusion, certainty and vehemence. Leonard doesn't know who to trust and has to write notes and snap photos to remember who he thinks people are. But someone may be trying to deceive him, or Leonard may be living a lie. As I've never seen Pearce act before, I was impressed by his performance as the scenes play out of order to mirror Leonard's plight.<br/><br/>The opening shot of the film is played in reverse, as a photograph fades back to white. This is like having a blank canvas with an 'Etch a Sketch.' Some people are good at using them to create decent artwork, others not so much. This is where Memento fails. It crafts 3/4 of an effective and pleasant portrait, but then decides to erase it.<br/><br/>With the sense of humor and dependability of an insolent child, it offers a pretentious and underwhelming twist instead. This twist emerges as a shocking turn for the worst, especially after so much buildup and countless u-turns. Despite my efforts to solve the mystery, and my investment to wait for the nearly 2 hour film to reveal the truth, Memento flatly explained how there was nothing behind the curtain. If that's true, then why was it on the screen to start with? I like teases with hair; not from women or movies. Leave the lame trickery to Scooby-Doo villains."
"g-phanisrinivas","10","1","2","9 January 2013"," Phenomenal!
","I will not reveal anything about the plot. It is a phenomenal story and screenplay that is confusing and awesome at the same time. One cannot stop appreciating the writer's intelligence and how he manipulates the protagonist's short term memory loss in his reverse chronology. There are more than 20 scenes that take place in reverse order and they being clubbed with the chronological scenes that take place before the reverse one makes it far more confusing than I imagined it to be before viewing. The reverse as well as the forward chronology of the scenes contributes tremendously to maintaining the suspense in the film. The film might tend to get boring if you lose track of the story. Nothing is spoon fed and the film expects the viewer to keep his thinking caps on throughout.<br/><br/>Confuse the viewers and they don't question is the simple formula the film follows. But confusion doesn't mean plot-holes. If the film is reassembled into the chronological order (in the suggested 1, V, 2 , W, , 21, B, 22/A order), everything makes sense. The only illogical scenes in the film are the momentary flashbacks involving Sammy Jankis, his wife and the protagonist Leonard, which even after multiple viewings doesn't answer some important questions. The film's order is the most important aspect of the film that has been discussed about. After watching the film, I would suggest going through the dissections by various critics on the net to understand the story better and appreciate the hard work behind it.<br/><br/>Reviewing the film after a single viewing is an injustice to the film; absolutely nobody can decipher the complex story in one go. The film doesn't make a lasting impression in the first watch because of its non- linear and blatantly confusing nature. I bet most of the negative reviews are mainly because understanding the film for a common mind is difficult. But that doesn't affect the prototypical nature of the film that is sure to have inspired many other films and will do so for years to come. It is a rarity that even those who hate it actually hate it for the same reasons why I call it a rarity.<br/><br/>Cinematography was functional but the background score was good. Editing is razor sharp. Direction by Christopher Nolan deserves immense praise. I did not like the Batman series very much but Memento covers it up. The complex story that questions the accuracy and deformability of memory required a director of his level. He nails it and how! Guy Pearce essays subtle shrewdness that his character has despite the disorder. Carrie- Anne Moss is passable. Joe Pantoliano is an actor to watch out. He slips into his sleazy and unconventional character with effortless ease and shocks at many points in the film. His character has multiple dimensions and he never messes them up.<br/><br/>Memento is landmark cinema that can't be overlooked.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Leonard Shelby-""I have to believe in a world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there. Do I believe the world's still there? Is it still out there? Yeah. We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are. I'm no different."" Christopher Nolan once again creates one of the most mind bending and thrilling movie that has to be one of the greatest experience you will have on film history. Memento is a confusing but a clever and unique movie that will blow your mind just by a few minutes into the movie. This Movie also relates to Insomnia and Inception, meaning the filming (using random flashbacks and using some sort of strange vision, like filming backwards or extreme close-ups).Christopher Nolan also brings back the looks and characters to his later movies, Like the name Kobb from Following to Inception and the looks of Teddy and Catherine from Memento to Gordon (Batman Begins and Dark Knight) and Maul (Inception).<br/><br/>Guy Pearce Dominates in this classic thriller playing Leonard, a man with short-term memory loss that wakes up in a random room, not knowing what the hells going on, until looking at his body. tattoos fill up his chest with one saying ""JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE"", and the rest saying facts leading up to the murderer. He also finds his Polaroid pictures, one with a guy with glasses and a mustache, named Teddy, and other pictures of information. Everyday he has to go through the same thing, so you gotta feel bad for him. For the rest, you probably have to find out the stuff yourself.<br/><br/>I love how Nolan takes control of his movies like this, I guess he wants everything to be good, and he did a pretty good job doing so. He creates the most innovated dramas that nobody can miss, and thats why he goes right up to one of my favorite directors. If this movie is too confusing for you, the ending will sum it all up for you, then you can watch it the second time to try to pick up info, like I did, and boy was I confused."

It stars Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, a man with anterograde amnesia,which impairs his ability to store new explicit memories. During the opening credits, which portray the end of the story, it is shown that Leonard kills Teddy,played by Joe Pantoliano. The film suggests that this killing is vengeance for the rape and murder of his wife based on information provided by Natalie,played by Carrie- Anne Moss.<br/><br/>This film is often used to show the distinction between plot and story. Its events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives — one in color, and the other in black-and-white. The black-and-white sections are told in chronological order, showing Leonard conversing with an anonymous phone caller in a motel room. Leonard's investigation is depicted in color sequences that are in reverse chronological order. As each sequence begins, the audience is unaware of the preceding events, just like Leonard, thereby giving the viewer a sense of his confusion. By the film's end when the two narratives converge we understand the investigation and the events that lead up to Teddy's death.<br/><br/>Memento is not only a film that would give the audience great entertainment but it is also provides them a one of a kind movie experience.Aside from having the plot and the story told in a non- traditional manner whether it is colored/black and white or chronological/reverse-chronological,it involves the viewer into solving the puzzles and mysteries of a crime thriller. Although some may not appreciate the way the story was told as people may not get right way the fashion on how the plot and the story is being told,it nevertheless puts the viewer into the inner workings of the mind as well as the character of Leonard as well as emotions depicted in the movie.That is why it definitely provides the viewer an absorbing experience although it may create confusion to some."

But did the victim deserve it? Or did someone trick Lenard Shelby into killing the wrong man? And if so, why?<br/><br/>Because of his 'condition,' Lenard knows he has to watch out for people who want to take advantage of him. Condition is a euphemism for severe brain damage, which left him unable to make new memories. The last thing he does remember is his wife dying in front of him. When he closes his eyes, he sees her dying, and since he can't make new memories, the horror of her death and the pain of his loss is always there, fresh and never fading.<br/><br/>Memento at its heart is a quest for freedom from the prison of personal limitation. Lenard desperately wants to regain control over his reality. He follows clues, writes notes, takes photos, hypothesizes solutions. These things, however, can never compensate for the terrible loss of both the continuity of the present and the connectedness of time itself; he knows neither what year it is now nor how long ago his wife died. But he believes if he can somehow avenge his wife, even with his tremendous limitations, he will regain some part of the self-worth that he lost when his brain became damaged.<br/><br/>Profound, unique, and beautiful in its achievement -- Memento isn't a gimmick; it's an elusive puzzle with a clear answer.

","At first, a rather likable but pitiful guy seems to engage the viewer and you want to be interested in his plight but you soon realize that the lead character is not really a protagonist. And about 1/3 of the way in, you start questioning why this mentally handicapped individual doesn't take better notes. Why not a journal or tape recorder, even a camcorder? He leaves himself pictures of people and things with 1 sentence notes that he sometimes describes as ""fact"" but are little more than here-say or supposition. Now this would be fine for someone who just needs to jog their memory but for someone with no short term memory at all the scenario is ludicrous. For example, instead of simply stating ""don't trust so and so"", a journal entry or tape recorded message fully stating why not to trust someone would be perfectly understandable but it isn't done. At one point, this person who is completely reliant on pens has no pen or any other writing utensil. In fact, he sees the person he is conversing with hiding all of the pens and he doesn't question that? OK, I need to suspend my disbelief. It does become apparent at the very end, that there is no ""wife killer"" and he really isn't all that innocent in his wife's current condition. He seems to dispatch anyone who confronts him with truth or reality yet he welcomes those who would use him for their own means. Killing is killing to him I guess; and reasons can be manipulated to achieve the end result as long as the end result is another death. Shoddy notes are just a means to an end. One gets the impression that he might enjoy killing, and manipulating his memory is just as good an excuse as any in his demented mind.

","First off, the reason I am rating this highly is #1: The acting was supreme- the cast was excellent. #2: The plot was very engaging; at no time was I bored- every second was spent racking my brain trying to put the pieces together.<br/><br/>The unfortunate part is, I've only seen the movie once (just now), and don't know what to make of the story. The one thing I wanted to know was left unanswered, or possibly was answered, but perhaps I need to watch the movie again about five times back to back and then spend a few days mulling it over to figure it out.<br/><br/>Complex is the best way to describe the plot of this movie. It was done in reverse fashion, showing the latest scenes first, followed by a scene one step early, and so on. This added an extra component of viewer involvement; I had to be locked into the plot every second for fear that I would miss something, and I probably have.<br/><br/>The main character was excellent; very believable. I suppose it probably isn't too hard to act as someone who hasn't experienced something, especially when you never have. Perhaps this is part of why it was such a believable film.<br/><br/>I have not yet read any of the other reviews on this film, but am eager to see what others have to say on it. Perhaps a more observant person (with a better memory for details) will shed some light on this.<br/><br/>I do highly recommend the movie; it is very watchable, and just interesting in general. Well worth it."

","Christopher Nolan is one of the best young directors and I have loved Prestige, Dark Knight and Inception. Still I consider Memento to be his best film. Sure Inception had my brain buzzing, Dark Knight gave us Joker, and Prestige was a delight, still I think Memento is his best film.<br/><br/>Memento has two time-lines, one in black and white and one in color, and they are alternated throughout the film. In no other movie has use of time-lines or alternating visual themes have been more justified. Even when I saw the movie for the first time, mu brain was working overtime, but after watching the movie I was aware that I had watched a really amazing film. But it was the second time around that I was able to connect all the dots and grasp the genius behind the movie.<br/><br/>Many critics criticize Nolan's movies saying that his movies don't have an emotional core. I think that is totally wrong. Maybe they are criticizing just because it is their job to find faults. Nolan is one the finest directors and he chooses the finest actors. Actors like DiCaprio, Cotillard, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, Edward Norton etc are the finest actors around and they wouldn't have starred in his movies if they though they would not be allowed to show their skills to full extent. Besides the twisting plots Nolan's movies have strong emotional core, whether it is a bewildered Leonard Shelby of Memento or Cobb of Inception we can see them fighting the world and fighting themselves at the same time. They are distant but we can stil connect with them.<br/><br/>What I loved the most about the movie was that everything was not cut and clear, even after you have seen it twice a certain uncertainty remains which is deliberate on part of Nolan as we are sharing that uncertainty with the movie's protagonist Leonard Shelby.<br/><br/>One of my top movies and should be seen at least twice (maybe more even for some) to be appreciated fully."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","2","3 May 2011"," ""Chris N. will trick your mind"" ... a review a la 'Memento' ...
","""Memento"" is not your typical whodunit film, it's more a howcatchem, where we don't know who to catch, except maybe the first victim, Joe Pantaliano, a friendly mustached man, accused of being the author of a horrific rape and murder. He doesn't even have time to defend himself, Lenny, played by Guy Pearce, kills him ruthlessly, until we see the stains of bloods and drops going in reverse, and understand the direction the film will take, for our delighted surprise.<br/><br/>'Remember Sammy Jenkins': Lenny's motto, the only thing he conditioned himself to remember. It's the story of a man suffering from his same short-term memory, until it ultimately killed his wife. This probably is the element that justified the use of the backwards narration because it shows the deadly nature of Lenny's memory problem, Lenny who just killed a man thought to be his wife's murderer. Two parallel stories, one bloody murder, one revenge story, a short-term memory, a story in reverse, a claustrophobic setting, there's something quite uneasy in this cinematic journey. And the dizziness is the same as when you sit in the opposite seats of the train's direction, but you will arrive at destination. And that the identity of the murderer will be revealed, or no, that the revelation will be shocking. Because Memento is not your typical whodunit film  <br/><br/>Basically, the reverse thing's point is to teach us, not to believe in the appearances. Lenny's condition needs proofs, things written, everywhere, tattooed in his body, pictures with names on it, and devices written as to warn himself from the danger of being teased. The guy killed in the beginning, named Teddy, surprisingly seems to be Lenny buddy and helper, but he's tagged as suspicious in his photography. Every hint has to be material, but the more we get in Lenny's conditions, the more we realize that these precautions act like a double-edged sword. So the movie basically, prepares us to a biggest surprise about the identity of the murderer, who's probably not that Teddy. How could we be so sure? Simply, because the movie is a mystery, and the resolution can only come at the end. Besides, such a powerful film can't afford an ordinary ending. And this is where the 'Sammy Jenkins' situation interferes with our understanding of the film. 'Remember Sammy Jenkins': Lenny's motto, the only thing he conditioned himself to remember  <br/><br/>Among the great memorable scenes, there's one where you wonder why Lenny's being mocked by a drunkard while tasting a beer given by the waitress that would help him in his investigation, until the previous scene that happened before in the story, you see that she spitted on it, to test him. Then, she was convinced, and so were we. That was a comic relief scene, but how about the one where she comes with her face beaten, asking for his help, until we realize in the previous-next scene that he was the one teased to hit her in the face. But the palm of the funniest (yes, I know it's a drama, but this one was priceless) is the priceless ""I'm chasing this gun?"" ""No, he's chasing me"". These ten seconds are enough justifications to the backwards narration. And since the movie starts with the killing, basically, the reverse thing's point is to teach us, not to believe in the appearances  <br/><br/>Lenny's short-term memory problem: the kind of plot device that could taste like caviar when handled by a good screenwriter and like tomato juice by another. Basically, if he just finished reading this part of the review, he can't remember how it started; imagine how painful it would be. I don't know, if this handicap convinced Chris Nolan to make the story backwards of it's the idea of making a story backwards that reminded him of memory problems, but it would be like discussing of what was first: the egg or the chicken  The idea was perfect, and the way, we follow Lenny in his backwards quest to find the murdered of his wife is a gold mine for memorable situations. Among the great memorable scenes, there's one where you wonder why Lenny's being mocked by a drunkard while tasting a beer given by the waitress  <br/><br/>Simply, a brilliant story. Did you notice I used a specific word: story? There is the script, and the story, too. The story had to justify this architecture. By the way, I'm using the word architecture for the second time, because I know Nolan is like an architect of screen writing, using plot devices as so many bricks to build unforgettable movies, I didn't think it worked that well for ""Inception"" because it lacked something called 'heart', it works with ""Memento"" because the story has one, and its heart pumped by a true desire of revenge. Lenny, played by a superb Guy Pearce, has one quest, finding John G., the one who raped and murdered his wife. His motives are understandable, and the story would have been a normal linear chase if it wasn't for one handicap: Lenny's short-term memory problem, the kind of plot device that could taste like caviar when handled by a good screenwriter  <br/><br/>""Memento"" is a cinematic experience that tricks your mind from beginning to end, or should I say, from the ending to the beginning, or wait a minute, again, I'm lost  Now, where was I? Oh yeah, you know that they say about a good script? It must have a beginning, middle, and an ending  but not necessarily in that order. I guess ""Memento"" respects the idea of what makes a good story, but the genius of the script, and the brilliance of its creativity rely on the incredible architecture that started the film at the end, to go on backwards, until an unforgettable climactic conclusion, that occurred at the beginning of the story. Simply, a brilliant story"
"ernestas1920","10","1","2","11 January 2011"," complicated , but awesome movie
","This is one the most complicated movies i have ever seen. I need it to watch ""memento"" 3 times to puzzle out all the small things in this movie. Main character of the movie is fashionably looking Leonard. He is chasing the guy that killed his wife. The only thing that really gets in his way of looking the murderer, is that he's having short term memory loss. It means that Leonard is forgetting everything he done in a last couple of hours. So he uses all sorts of pictures, notes and tattoos to help himself. Offcourse its much easier to manipulate that kind of guy... The main thing that makes this movie epic is that it has 2 story lines. One of them ( that is in black and white) is telling normally, but the another is telling backwards. It means that things u will see later in the movie have happened before the thing u saw in the beginning. Director Christopher Nolan have tried to do something like that in the movie ""The prestige"". So in the end of the movie two story lines are combining into one event that explains all the movie. In my opinion Memento is a great movie whit good acting and directing. If u are watching this movie first time it may get a little confusing at the beginning, but then u will figure it all out."

","This is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, his best film, the one that I like the most. He has made some really great movies, but none have been as good as this. Not only is this my favorite Nolan movie, it's one of my favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>What don't I like, well, I guess there are a few times where you can get confused. And at times the narration may feel unneeded, but those are really only small nitpicks.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is the way it's shown, it's not a straight narrative, there are black and white scenes that go straight, but then the color scenes go backwards, all setting up this mystery. Nolan tried to do that with his first movie, ""Following,"" but this is where he perfected it. The mystery is very well done, and actually gives the movie more re-watch value, I've seen the movie several times and still don't know exactly what happened. The acting is great all around, Teddy ads some really good comedic relief, the cinematography and editing are excellent.<br/><br/>There's not much to say without spoiling anything, please if you haven't seen this movie, go see it, it really is a fantastic movie, and in my opinion, Christopher Nolan's best."
"kdogsho","5","1","2","18 February 2007"," summary
","This show, Memento, is a very hard one to understand. It doesn't come out and say what is happening in that point in time. It does a lot of flashbacks to what happened a days ago, or sometimes even hours ago. Leonard has this condition that he can't make new memories. I think these changes in time are his memory, and it is showing us the memory he is trying to produce. When it changes that means that he had lost that memory. Also, this show keeps your mind wondering. It doesn't show us the bad guys and who he is looking for, it just shows us people as we normally see them. Such as Natalie when she appears to be a good person, then you realize that later on she is using his sickness against him to kill someone. The conclusion to this show was a real thinker, because it made you think about everything that the main character has been telling us throughout the movie. Just like when Teddy said that Sammy didn't have a wife, that it was his own wife that had diabetes. It made you think that it was possible that this was himself killing his own wife by giving her to many shots and putting her into a coma. Or, could Teddy be lying about every?"

","Coincidence has always been a staple of narrative fiction, many films have used coincidence, in fact more than a few have relied on it but I do feel that Memento pushes things a bit.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce plays an insurance investigator whose first case involves a man who claims to have no short term memory; he in fact can't make new memories, a very rare condition. After a thorough investigation Pearce refuses the claim, concluding that the man is faking it. (Even though in a test the claimant repeatedly picks up an electrified object, forgetting in a matter of a couple of minutes the electric shock he keeps getting)<br/><br/>So shortly thereafter, when Pearce surprises a rapist attacking his wife and receives a blow to the head, what do you think is the outcome? You guessed it, he can't form new memories!<br/><br/>The device of telling the story `backwards' has been done before in the Harold Pinter-scripted British drama `Betrayal' and in the Jane Campion Australian TV-feature `Two Friends'. But perhaps it hasn't been tried in a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>Blonded Aussie Pearce does a convincing U.S. accent but I wasn't as impressed as most were by Memento."

I did ""get it"", so that was not a problem, but I believe this will test the patience of many who are not planning to sit down and pay attention (you'll also have to turn up your volume, as many parts of the film are literally quiet, sound quality not very well planned IMO, also Ritchie's character is very monotone). I found it creative with the overlapping back-tracking through time segments,as well as the side story dealing with the ""patient"", but I won't get into that so to not spoil anything.

Pearse is on top form and gives a consistently good performance. likewise, Nolan's directing must be acknowledged as very good. yes, the way the film is shot is original and yes, the story is original but talk about an anti - climax. i was completely unsatisfied with the conclusion of the film. nevertheless, this is a very good film but it still doesnt not deserve to have such a high ranking in the best 250 films. i would rate it **1/2 out of ****"
"dalbuc","6","1","2","5 July 2003"," Good not Great
","The praise of this film is overblown...without a doubt. Easy way to judge the film: play it in the proper order and see how highly rated it is. Answer: not very. Played forward the film is afairly predictable and easy to see coming. So the story itself isn't compelling. None of the characters are particulary anything other than Guy Pearce- mianly becuase Pearce's character ""sees"" all the other characters and doesn't know anything real about them so neither do you.<br/><br/>All that said, the arrangment of this film is what sets it apart and makes it not something dull and boring. Other films have used this technique but the technique does work in this case and it adds a level of interest to the film that the story itself does not wholly deserve.<br/><br/>BTW, most of the ""talking"" about the film afterwards has to do with the open questions left by the film's plot. The question isn't what happens in the film and what you missed (6th Sense or Usuaul suspects) but what happens before the story that you are never told all that muhc about. There are ""supporting"" materials at the offical web site that add depth to the tale and make some of the questions- well frankly not very questionable."

However, originality does not bring to this film any other good qualities: it is boring, poorly thought out, and much of the plot is irrelevant.  The subplot featuring Carrie Ann Moss has no connection to the overall conspiracy that the main character is searching for, and could just as easily have been left out.

The beginning is John G's murder being played backward (and this doesn't look funny like when u rewind something on a VCR, it looks really cool) and then you see the main character narrating in black and white (which is during a different time).  Of course, you have to watch the movie a few times, and it is not flawed in any way!  Some say that his memory loss should've made him forget he had memory loss, but then they don't bother to think about it.

If you watch the dvd there's an interview with the director and he points out that his goal was to put the viewer in Leonard's shoes.  A very big part of being in Leonard's shoes is being confused, lost, and not having control of what's going on.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of the movie you'll feel confused and lost as well; don't take that personally, just consider how effectively the director did the job of making you feel that way.

But he knows he must find them, to avenge the murder of his wife and the bash in the head that caused his memory loss. But is he sure his wife is dead? He can't remember. How does he know the cops haven't already caught the guy? He can't remember. Can he trust anyone? Maybe, he can scribble things on polaroids and little notes. But can he trust himself to be responsible for what he does and doesn't write down? He can't remember. Somehow, director Nolan produced the brilliant idea of playing the scenes in reverse order, so that the audience also has a memory loss, adding to the entertainment quality. The scenes aren't backwards they just follow each other end to beginning, in this form: minutes 7,8,9,5,6,7,4,5,6,3,4,5,1,2,3...etc. Hopefully you get the idea. Very strong three dimensional characters, despite the lack of character roles. Don't be surprised for a cliff hanger ending. Or should I say, cliff hanger beginning?"

What could be just another noir with a surprising end became better: a unique film. First, because the end is the beginning and the beginning is the end. You are going to watch a movie invertedly, and it is not enough: the script complicates it much more, but through a way which exacts from you more than mere perception. The history works deeply with the strange amnesia that confuses the poor avenger (Guy Pearce). You and him just don't know who to trust. Initially,  you know the result of investigations (shown in the beginning), that is a scene where Guy Pearce appears killing a man, but... is he the true killer who he's looking for? you will have the answer at the end, or better, at the beginning.<br/><br/>Memento already became an atemporal film, of course no one would try to edit a film like it is. And everything is carefully thought: the black & white scenes along the film allow we differ in memory the chronology; the mementos in Pearce's body are an inteligent method and characterize the protagonist; the polaroid is another great idea, just like the sensation we have watching the film, but in the film it appears losing focus, back to front."

They might as well watch another movie based on an American tragedy with lovers in the mix of things (you know what movies I'm talkin about).  Memento, on the other hand, is like no movie you have ever seen before.  It's one of the greatest (perhaps even thee greatest) thiller ever put together.

"fineanimal","8","1","2","31 August 2002"," Great film, but the DVD is hurting.
","Enough reasonable (and a few truly dismal) reviews of Mememto already exist on the IMDB, so I can only add my vote that Memento is a film worth seeing. Whether or not it deserves to be called one the ""greatest films of all time"" is irrelevant, since that is a subjective honor anyway. It's high ranking is almost certainly due to a rapid flood of votes following its recent release (I mean, come on--Lord of the Rings ranks even higher than Casablanca, Star Wars and Citizen Kane!). The point is that, objectively speaking, Memento is a truly original, unique, and well made film, and there is some truly fascinating and thoughtful dialogue and narrative here. For that reason alone any film lover should check it out.<br/><br/>I must add, however, that the DVD features an Independent Film Channel interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan that is one of the most visually irritating pieces I have ever seen. The interview randomly skips frames, causing subtle but silly jumps that remind me of the lousy black & white film the castaways on Gilligan's Island once made (""I'd walk out on that picture even on an airplane!""). Presumably, someone thought this was an artistic touch, but the end result is that it just looks dumb, and I had to *turn the video off on a DVD* in order to enjoy or get anything positive out of the interview! That's quite a blunder considering how worthy the film itself is."

","Memento is a thought-provoking and potentially uncomfortable discovery into people through the main character Leonard.<br/><br/>SideNote: The biggest complaint my friends had about the film is that they couldn't grasp the multitude of time shifts that occur in the movie. These are key to understanding the plot and the motivations and mind-set of Leonard. I didn't have any difficulty in this area, perhaps because I am described as observant and attentive. By the time the third shift happened, I was ready for it, and by the end of the movie, was relishing each shift. In case its not obvious, if you can't handle these shifts, you will not do well in understanding the movie. :End SideNote<br/><br/>Leonard can't fix his life. He asserts that he is seeking revenge for his wife's murder, but that is a smokescreen to him dealing with the person he's become, and the life he's living. He can't let go of the notion that his wife is just around the corner, 'just gone to the bathroom'. This haunts him. If he could just wake up one day knowing that his wife was gone, he could let go. He destroys evidence and kills people, but when he wakes up, his purpose in life will still be to find John G., as tatooed on his body.<br/><br/>The uncomfortable truth uncovered through Leonard is the limitations, frailties, and desperation we all contain. Leonard's memory problem sets the backdrop, and his dealing with it is where you will start questioning things. While you can mentally seperate yourself from the character in the beginning because you don't share his particular ailment, in relection you will see the connections to all people.<br/><br/>My reaction to Leonard's character changed with my changing perception of his motivations, as well as how conscious he was of his actions. Victim? Murderer? Confused and desperate? Its all there.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Memento, and I intend to watch this movie again. There are many levels here, and I want to pick up on more. I saw the DVD on the small screen. Included is an interview with the director, which carried some interest. Unfortunately, the interviewer didn't seem to fully understand the movie, which weakened it somewhat."

","This film is an inspiration to screenwriting and movie making. Definitely a great among greats. This film is unforgettable. It's a masterpiece!<br/><br/>An original idea, an amazing film. This film goes beyond any Drama or Crime Thriller story. It's about a man, Lenny. He's got a short-term memory condition. The film is well edited in the way you follow the story with more meaning to it. The film is presented backwards. It truly fits the story, great overall cinematography. Lenny's life is pretty much twisted, as his memory is weak and he has to depend on his notes and tattoos. It's hard to talk about this film with detail, as it will spoil the film. It must be seen. <br/><br/>One of the best written films ever. I reckon it by far deserves Oscar nominations on more aspects. The acting was well done, and every other aspect in editing was excellent. Memento should have deserved a Best Picture nomination. I don't know why it didn't. It only got 2 nominations, when it well deserved more. I don't get how the Academy Awards is run. See how good 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly' is, it was nominated nothing!<br/><br/>This film must be seen by everyone. It's not just a film, it goes beyond any normal film and any great film. This is an inspiration. It is the best Drama/ Thriller/ Crime/ Mystery film I have ever seen. This rates in my book as being the greatest film ever made alongside with 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly'.

It's a good film, but not worthy of a top 10 film of all time.<br/><br/>I saw this film a while back and didn't think it was very good, it was WAY TOO confusing, and not terribly interesting.  But a friend of mine wanted to see it, so I went ahead and watched it again with him.  I must say that the film was MUCH better the second time around and made a lot more sense.  But, even still, the movie is nothing profound, if you ask me.  I would have a VERY hard time saying this film is anywhere near my favorite 100 films or even my favorite 500 films.<br/><br/>If you're into confusing movies and really like the movie-making aspect of films (editing, directing, acting, etc...) , then you'll probably want to see this film.  But if you're the type of person that just wants to sit back and be entertained, then I'm not sure what to tell you.  This is not an action-packed film, there is virtually no action and is a very slow film, but not to the point where you're looking at your watch every five minutes.<br/><br/>So, if you do end up seeing the movie, make sure you pay attention to every word and every scene as closely as possible.

","I rented Memento not knowing what to expect.  After viewing it, I was speechless.  The plot of the movie is impossible to describe in a few sentences - it is so much more than simply a murder mystery.  It is a movie unlike any I have ever seen; for instance, chronologically Memento begins at the end, and ends in the middle, while during the movie the plot jumps back and forth between the present and the past.  The central character of the movie, Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce), is in every scene.  It is Pearce's depiction of a man uncapable of forming new memories ever since his wife's death that carries the whole movie.  By the end, we see that a lack of memory is perhaps the worst handicap anyone can have.  I highly recommend this movie to all viewers, but be warned - in order to truly appreciate this movie you have to be paying attention to every detail."
"bobjohndave","Null","1","2","6 August 2002"," Remember Sammy Jankis
","Let me start this off by saying ""Whoa! This movie is absolutely spectacular!"" ... After you watch it several times. I first heard of this movie from a friend in my Drama class. He was incredibly ecstatic about Memento. He rambled on about it for twenty minutes, giving praise to the creators of this masterpiece. I decided, being the quality film buff that I am, that I should check it out. This first time around, I found the plot to be cumbersome and hard to follow. I didn't want to brush it off as some sort of elaborate gimmick film just yet, so as soon as the ending credits rolled, I started the DVD over and watched it from the top again. The second time through, I was able to follow the complicated plot twists with better ease. I had this same problem with Pulp Fiction, but, as with Pulp Fiction, watching the movie twice helped to alleviate my worries.<br/><br/>  Memento drops you into the mind of a man named Leonard, who runs around playing detective while hot on the heels of John G., the man who he believes is one of the two men responsible for the rape and murder of his beloved wife. John G., who escaped from the crime scene unscathed, didn't leave empty handed. With him he took away Leonard's ability to make new memories. Now Leonard stumbles around in a world of delirium and uncertainty as he searches for the man who killed his wife. Without a short term memory and the ability to make new memories, Leonard is forced to rely on scattered notes written on paper, tatoo facts, and Poloroid pictures to make his life liveable. The life of John or Jack G.(Leonard's not sure of which name it is) now depends upon Leonards ""notes"". Sadly enough, Leonard isn't even aware of how long his wife has been dead. He doesn't even know if he'll remember that he has killed John G. after he finds him and kills him.<br/><br/>    Along the way Leonard meets Natalie, a bartender, and keeps bumping into a mysterious man named Teddy who claims to be Leonard's friend. These two are constantly pulling Leonard in different directions, which leads to an interesting question. Who should he trust? And a tattoo on Leonard's left hand reminds him to ""REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS."", a man with the same short term memory problem as Leonard. What's the connection between Sammy and Leonard? Watch the movie to find out!<br/><br/>   Overall, this is a great film that is worthy of a lot of your time. And trust me, it's going to take a lot of your time to figure this movie out. The acting is wonderful, the cinematography works great with the memory loss angle, and the telling of the story in reverse breathes a fresh breath of air into the movie industry. Guy Pearce(Leonard) is at his best in this film, as is Joe Pantoliano(Teddy). Carrie-Anne Moss(Natalie) deserves an honorable mention as well. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you guessing to the final moments of the film, then look no further than Memento."

Leonard spends his life after the incident trying to find the man that did it. Unfortunately, Leonard has no short term memory.  He can't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.

"michaelpaulcolo","10","1","2","6 July 2002"," A movie to 'remember'
","Wow! ""Memento"" is one the best films I've seen in a long time. Only a couple of small inconsistencies stop me from considering it a masterpiece. It is however, the type of film that makes you think and pay attention as you watch. If you like to just sit back and relax while the movie pleasantly and neatly unfolds from beginning to end and everyone lives happily ever after, this one may not be for you. <br/><br/>The gist: Leonard Shelby wakes up, looks around, and realizes he's in a motel room. But for how long? Could be a day, a week, he's not sure. Sounds like a really bad hangover, huh? Actually, he suffers from memory loss. Not the typical amnesia you've seen in about a hundred previous movies. Instead of not knowing his past or who he is, Leonard has exactly the opposite problem. He can remember everything in his life up to 'the incident'. But now, due to his 'condition', he can't make any new memories. He can only remember things for a few minutes and then it fades away. Interesting concept. To function in society, he must write important things down and take Polaroid pictures of people and places in order to 'remember' them later. Really important facts he tattoos all over his body. Early in the film, we find that Leonard's driving force is to hunt down the person responsible for wrecking his life. A monumental task considering he can't remember people or know whom he can trust.<br/><br/>An interesting aspect of this movie is that is viewed in reverse. It starts with the last chronological scene and works it's way, scene by scene, backward to 'the incident'. This, no doubt, contributes to the confusion some people have expressed. In my opinion, Christopher Nolan makes it work quite well. It is arguably the only way to shoot a plot of this nature. If it moves along chronologically, the audience knows (and remembers) everything that happens while poor Leonard forgets everything after a few minutes and looks like an idiot. The other effect that the reverse chronology had on me was that after viewing the film, I immediately wanted to see it again. How often can you say that about a movie? The desire to watch a particular movie more than once is the reason we buy them anyway, right?<br/><br/>There are no mega star actors, no acclaimed director, no multi-million dollar special effects, and was shot in 25 days. But it is an exceptional film due to excellent directing, acting and thought provoking original plot. Hollywood should take a good look at this and consider overhauling their usual cookie cutter movie-making machine.<br/><br/>The plot wasn't logically perfect and there was one piece of the puzzle that didn't neatly fit (I can't elaborate without giving spoilers), but it was altogether too good to nitpick. If you like to be challenged a bit by a movie as opposed to being lulled to sleep, this one's definitely a 'Must See'."

It's simply about a man who is unable to retain new memories after the rape and murder of his wife. He is now completely consumed with revenge, believing that killing his wife's murderer will bring justice. Thus, this movie becomes uninteresting and predictable. I just wanted this movie to end as soon as possible. The plot was dull and I was never seriously interested in who the murderer was. In the end I finally realized that the whole movie was pointless, `spoilers' since he'd already achieved his goal. Was I supposed to be impressed by this weak ending? Am I supposed to say it's the best movie ever made with an unexpected ending? The actors in this movie don't really show their depth, they should have been more dramatic without overacting.<br/><br/>
This has been one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. I disliked it enormously. I disliked even more the fact that most reviewers loved it. This movie leaves too much to be desired.

","OK, it's a good movie, and it's creative, but it's not THAT great.  It's original, in that the movie is presented in reverse chronological order to emphasize the confusion of having no memory.  But that's not the most creative thing in the world. The makers of Seinfeld did it a few years ago very well in a sit-com episode.  Is something that has been done on a TV sitcom really that innovative in a film?  The acting is good, the concept is interesting, but the main reason you will hear a lot of people say this movie is good is because it is complex.  If you say you didn't like this movie, it is because you didn't UNDERSTAND this movie.  If you were smarter, you would like it.  Do you think I'm going to admit to people face to face that I didn't think it was that great?  Of course not!  Because they would think, ""oh, he must not be that smart"".  Don't get me wrong, I did like it (read - I am smart!), but not as much as the commenters here did who are falling over each other to praise the movie.  It's pretty good and it's different, but that's about it.  The complex stuff that you're supposed to be smart to figure out is also kind of annoying and gets in the way of the acting and the story.  If you can figure out how to market a product like this you are bound to succeed.  It's like Trivial Pursuit.  It was wildly successful game because it allowed 40% of people make the other 60% look dumb.  If you liked the game, you must be smart.  If you didn't, you must be dumb.  So, smart or dumb, go see the movie because it's pretty good, but don't go out of your way to brag about how much you liked it.  Just do something smart and brag about that."

","Have you been waiting for a film to demand your attention and leave you with questions that can only be answered by multiple viewings? Then your prayers have been answered. Memento ends as it begins, and the ending you see, before the credits roll, is chronologically the middle point of the story you watch unfold before you on screen. Confused? Well it is being shown to you in 5-10min. segments, progressingor digressing I should say, from the end to the beginning. You are completely immersed in the life of Leonard Shelby, a man that suffers from short-term memory loss, and lives his life by following the photos and messages he has made for himself. The script is based on a short story by Johnatan Nolan. Christopher Nolan, his brother, wrote the script and directed the film, this being his second feature. It is difficult for me to go on about the plot, because it truly is an experience to walk in there not knowing anything. This was not the case for me. I read a few reviews, many better than the one you are reading now. I knew what to expect about the backwards storytelling, as well as a few key points about the main characters, but nothing that was really crucial. There is really nothing that can prepare you for this film. I can honestly say I have never seen anything like it, and was happy to walk out of the theater with my mind pacing through the many possibilities. It sucks that I can't blab them out all here, but no spoilers, don't worry. I wouldn't do that. If you liked movies like Se7en, and Usual Suspects, than I definitely recommend the film. The similarities Memento has to those films are mostly in the overall tone, and that it is without a doubt a part of the Detective/Crime thriller genre. Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce to a ""T"", he is Leonard Shelby!!), becomes the ultimate hard-boiled detective. He's got drive, that being to find the man that murdered his wife, and he's got his short term memory loss which makes his task go from difficult to near impossible. But, unlike those other films, Memento shocks you at the beginning of every segment, where you are once again left to figure out where you are and whats going on, to the point where you may eventually lose track. By the time you reach the climax ending, you will probably be frustrated having tried so hard to outsmart the film. So, what am I trying to say? Well I'm not to sure how clear I have made myself, reviewing this film by saying anything other than ""Just go see it!!"", is pretty hard. I myself need to see it again, which would make it my third time. What I suggest is that you absolutely go see this film, sit back and just watch things unfold. Just watch, and the best I can promise you is that you won't feel so stupid when you WANT to buy a ticket to see it again."
"Aragorn22","9","1","2","15 May 2002"," One of the most original movies ever!
","For people who love to see movies with excellent scripts, psychologic effects and complicated plots, this movie is a must see one! The movie is about Lenny, who suffers from Anterograde Amnesia. This is a memory disease which enables the sufferer to make new memories. So, every day, he experience everything totally new. For example, every human being he has met after his disease onset is seen by him as a totally new person to meet. With this disease, he hunts the people who murdered his wife. The most brilliant thing about this movie is that it is played totally backwards: when the movie starts, you see the final scene. After that, the movie takes you back, scene by scene, to the beginning. In this way, the movie makes you experience it a bit like Lenny. You have to orientate everytime the movie goes one scene back, which makes this movie a bit complicated to follow. But, I can tell you, you will get rewarded with an absolute brilliant ending (or beginning!). Last but not least, Guy Pierce, who´s playing Lenny, gives away his best actors performance of his career so far. After having actors like de Niro and Pacino, we finally get a couple of new great actors in Hollywood.I would say that we have waited long for new great actors, but after Kevin Spacey and Russel Crowe, we´ve got two coming men: Edward Norton and the leading man of this movie: Guy Pierce. To movielovers I dare to say: don´t miss Memento and keep a close watch to Guy Pierce, he really is a coming man."

It´s exceptional, the way  it is narrated backwards,some time in colors, and in black and white when the director need it to show some other time, state of mind or...  a time ,before? the trauma ? From them on you began to ask yourself who is he?.    My mind at this point turned to work as his mind.

","If I had to choose one word to sum up this movie it'd be 'ingenious.'<br/><br/>
Leonard Shelby has a rare memory disorder - he can't remember anything since he had a blow on the head after fighting with his wife's killer. He knows everything about himself up to that point, but new memories gradually fade and are quickly lost. He'll be talking to someone but will forget how the conversation started. He'll wake up in a hotel room completely ignorant of how he got there. Since his last memory is of his dying wife, he lives in grief and his only goal in life is to catch and kill John G - his wife's murderer.<br/><br/>The film opens with the final scene in the plot and gradually takes you back through the story so that you only know why events take place after they've occurred. <br/><br/>This means that you instantly empathize with Leonard - there's no way you couldn't as like him, you don't 'remember' what's gone before. It's a rare breed - a movie that manages to transfer you into the mind of the main character using the film making technique rather than the plot. Like it or not, while watching it YOU TOO have a memory disorder and are forced to see the world through Leonard's eyes - truly ingenious.<br/><br/>As it goes on, you gradually realise that all isn't it seems and nobody is as they appear. I'm not going to give anything else away as it'll spoil it, but suffice it to say that it has a great twisting story, excellent acting and is shot beautifully in a minimalist noirish kind of way.<br/><br/>It's a film that needs multiple viewings - I certainly had to watch it two or three times before I understood exactly what's going on, but when all the pieces finally fit together it's a great feeling. The region 2 DVD has a hidden feature that allows one to watch the film rearranged in the correct order (it even has the credits running backwards at the beginning etc) which means that when you've finally worked it all out, you can check that your deductions are correct and that you properly understood. This is a brilliant feature and certainly adds to the film's longevity.<br/><br/>There are very few films that offer an experience as engrossing as this, although it's not for everyone. If you're the kind of person that likes to work things out for yourself using the available evidence (just like Leonard) then this is for you. If you like your movies to be clear cut and easy to understand on the original viewing, this may not be to your taste.<br/><br/>For me, it's one of the greatest films of recent years and comes wholeheartedly recommended."

","When I saw this movie, my boyfriend took me to see it without telling me a single thing about it, which is weird.  So, I go in and from the first few mins I'm confused.  But enthralled.  As soon as I got the concept, my eyes were PLASTERED to the screen.  It has been so long since I've seen a movie where the story is enough so that I don't have to say, ""and the cinematography helped"", or, ""the acting helped"".  I think that the Nolan brothers could have gotten monkeys to play the roles and used their camcorders to shoot and I still would have been walking away saying WOW (people tell me I'm a bit of an exaggerator, but you know what I mean). In a time where you cannot turn to a radio station without hearing some sort of sampling, a time where a trip to the movies is to see a remake of this old T.V. show or that old movie, or just plain old sequels, it was a breath of fresh air to see a movie with such a plot and such a way to tell it.  I give Memento 2 thumbs and 2 big toes way up!"
"DeeNine-2","10","1","2","18 February 2002"," Brilliant
","Looking at the premise of this movie, I recall that it can really happen. Neurologist Oliver Sacks, in his wonderful book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), recounts the story of a man who could only hold the memory of the last thirty seconds or so. Leonard's condition in this movie is better. Apparently he can hold in his mind what has happened over the last few minutes. Also he has the ability to follow a kind of learned routine in which he is able to function by continually writing himself notes. In the case recalled by Dr. Sacks, the man could not do that. He could not even remember enough to finish a short conversation.<br/><br/>The idea of taking notes to ""remember"" is something that some Alzheimer's patients are able to do in the early stages of the disease (which may be where Jonathan Nolan got the idea for his short story on which the film is based.) Sacks recalls such a case in his An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (1995). The notes act as the man's memory, just as the notes and photos do for Leonard in this movie.<br/><br/>The next question might be, could someone with Leonard's ""condition"" actually function well enough to get by without being institutionalized or having somebody take care of him on a minute to minute basis? Leonard says, ""Habit and routine...conditioning make my life possible."" He ""remembers"" to look in his jacket pocket to see where he is living. Presumably he also does this when he is in his car and has forgotten where he is going and doesn't know where he is. Presumably he has many notes that we don't see him refer to. How does he find his way back to his car after going somewhere? He identifies his car from a photo, but where is it parked? In the scene where he wakes up next to Natalie, he gets up and goes to his jacket and finds her picture so he knows who she is. He also finds a picture of her and Dodd. He somehow ""remembers"" the significance and writes on the back of her photo, ""...she lost someone too. She will help you out of pity."" How does he remember these things? Perhaps they are examples of ""implicit learning"" that ""Sammy"" was not able to accomplish, what Leonard calls ""conditioning."" In implicit learning as opposed to ""explicit,"" we learn to do something without knowing we learned it.<br/><br/>Regardless of these questions, this is a brilliantly conceived and plotted thriller, and the acting by the three principals is superb. Guy Pearce, plays Leonard in a most immediate and affecting manner so that we are forced us to identify with him and his predicament. Carrie-Anne Moss is mesmerizing with her sexy, mysterious eyes as the hard-edged and haunting Natalie. Joe Pantoliano is first rate as Teddy, the wisecracking, cynical and rather annoying undercover cop.<br/><br/>But what really makes this a stunning movie is the way it is constructed. The scenes are presented in reverse chronological order, so that we know the latest action first, and at the end of the movie find out the earlier action. This seems an extraordinary way to tell a story, but it works. Incidentally, there's a Seinfeld episode told this way, the one where they go to India for a wedding; and to some extent this technique was employed in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992). What makes it particularly effective here is the material. Leonard, as Teddy points out, is not the same person he was before his wife's death and his injury. For him the arrow of time has lost its meaning. Earlier events are just the same as later ones. Director Christopher Nolan (Jonathan's brother), who also wrote the screenplay, was able to dovetail the action scene by scene as we move backward in time so that what seems true in the beginning becomes different than what is true in the end. And indeed, like Leonard, our experience of the story doesn't depend on time's arrow.<br/><br/>Viewing this the second time (and you may feel a compulsion to do just that) some of the lines that were not funny initially become very funny. The voice-over in the chase scene with Dodd is an example. Leonard finds himself running and he says, ""So what am I doing?...I'm chasing him....No, he's chasing me!"" Or when Teddy asks about the gun, Leonard says, ""Must be his. I don't think they'd let somebody like me carry a gun."" Or Teddy's line to Leonard, ""I've had more rewarding friendships than this--but I get to keep telling the same jokes.""<br/><br/>The key to the powerful psychological ""ending"" of the film, where we realize what will eventually happen, occurs when Natalie tells Leonard that revenge is useless because he won't remember it. He replies, ""It doesn't matter whether I remember or not...."" Indeed we see that he really doesn't remember his revenge and that implies that he will... But you really need to see the movie to appreciate the stunning implication.<br/><br/>On another level this is a movie about what makes us human. What would life be like if we lived in an eternal present without reference to the past? We could be easily exploited by those with knowledge of the past, as Leonard is, but there is a deeper question being asked. Does life have any real meaning for a person without memory?<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","Now, i am a huge fan of this film, i love it, and can watch it a million times. Here's an interesting twist in the recent Academy Award nominations foolery. First, and foremost, the movie i didn't feel was up for enough, Director? Secondly, why is Memento listed under best original screenplay written directly for the screen. All of us who love the movie and have seen it know that it's based on a short story by Jonathan Nolan, it even says in the credits ""based upon"" by it. So this must mean due to the Academy's slip that by default, Memento cannot win. Or else someone explain it to me, please?"
"freezephyr","10","1","2","5 February 2002"," You will not forget this film.
","With a few exceptions Memento is a fairly common story.  In no way is it a common film.   This is one of the most cleverly edited films I have ever seen.  The approach that director Christopher Nolan takes to tell us the story is the films strongest suit.  This is not to say that the film is short in other aspects.  The cinematography is superb.  The actors deliver virtually flawless performances.  The score is never overpowering yet facilitates the feel of the scenes as they unfold.  The dialogue is intelligent and provoking.  The action is never boring with its stark transitions working to an integral purpose.<br/><br/>The way the story is told is the essence of Memento and why it works so well.  The story seems to play out in reverse.  That is partly true. It is told from the end AND the beginning towards the center, or summit if you will. The audience ultimately discovers the protagonist's true motivation and comes to understand the reasons behind the seemingly disjointed activities they have witnessed.<br/><br/>The film opens with what is surely the end of the story as the titles are presented.  Unlike the rest of the footage, this scene is truly played in reverse.  This is the story's ultimate conclusion.  However, after the opening titles are played, the first forward moving scene is of the protagonist in a motel room trying to adjust to his strange condition. This is the true beginning of the story time line.  The events are played forward in time and backwards in time, in parallel toward the astonishing final revelation.  The forward sequences are presented in black and white while the backward sequences are presented in color.  This interplay continues through out the film until the final segment where the two time points converge on the ultimate tension of the story.  At this convergence and within a single scene the black and white footage smoothly emerges into full color.  Even though they move forward in time, the black and white scenes are actually retrospective of the main character's experiences that lead him to his understanding of his condition. The affliction that the protagonist suffers is described through the experience of a third person whom we are, at a point in the story, led to confuse with the protagonist.  The truth is revealed at the climatic ending of the film; which as it turns out, is the summit of the story.  Everything becomes clear to the audience as to what the beginning of the film had revealed.<br/><br/>Memento is without a doubt the most effectual use of editing and story development to involve the audience with the problems of the protagonist that I have ever witnessed.  Memento is a masterful film that will surely become an example used in film making colleges for years to come.<br/><br/>John H. Freeman"

"KALKevin","Null","1","2","1 February 2002"," Memento intrigues, but fails to connect
","On its surface, Christopher Nolan's Memento may look like any other tale of revenge.  Loyal husband Leonard Shelby (The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert's Guy Pearce) wakes up one night to find an intruder is raping and murdering his wife.  When he attempts to intervene, however, Leonard is smashed against a mirror by a second assailant and left for dead.<br/><br/>Leonard's head injury leaves him with a unique malady, short-term memory loss.  As Leonard himself puts it, `I can't make new memories.'  He knows who he is.  He knows everything about his life up until the attack on his wife, but if he talks to you for more than 15 minutes, he'll forget who you are or what you were talking about.<br/><br/>Having no short-term memory is going to make exacting revenge upon the man who killed your wife a little bit difficult.  But Leonard is determined to succeed.  By using notes to himself (some made permanent as tattoos on his body) and Polaroid pictures, he hopes to piece together enough information to track down and kill the man he knows is responsible.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, on its surface, Memento looks pretty straightforward.  But Nolan, who also wrote the movie from brother Jonathan Nolan's short story, has a plan to take away the audience's short-term memory, thus putting them in the same predicament as his hero.<br/><br/>How does he do this?  Simple.  He tells his movie in reverse.  Thus, the audience is constantly having to piece the story together bit by bit, building it in their mind from the end to the beginning.  It's a brilliant move, although not unprecedentedboth Steven Soderbergh and Atom Egoyan have used similar time-bending techniques in their films.  And like Memento's Leonard, the audience, being left without a short term memory, is certainly kept on its toes.<br/><br/>But a clever idea doesn't always make for a great movie.  By telling his story in reverse, Nolan may have the audience relating to Leonard's problem, but not to Leonard himself.  Despite Pearce's bravura performance, it's difficult to make an emotional connection with his character.  We are not privy to seeing the progressing frustration that he feels, since his progression is actually working in reverse.  He is calmer and more in touch with reality at the end of the movie than at the beginning.  Thus, we only see his frustration at the beginning without the foundation as to why he's so distraught.<br/><br/>Along for the ride are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Moss, two characters who come into Leonard's life.  Both are trying to help him in his questor are they?  We soon question both their motives, but it's never really clear, even at the end of the movie, whether our suspicions are warranted or not.<br/><br/>So while one can certainly praise Memento for its clever devices and excellent performance by Pearce, it's difficult to praise it as a movie experience.  Its cerebral device obstructs any emotional contact.  And while it's wonderful to see a truly intelligent thriller, the thrills are muted by their lack of emotional weight.  Is it really too much to ask for an intelligent thriller with characters we can and do care about?"

","While this film is about someone with no short-term memory, it's very difficult for us to forget it. The plot is built in a backwards-linear way (as Christopher Nolan puts it) and this helps the viewer to actually get into the world of Leonard. What I like most is that you can't be based on a single thing! Additionally, every other aspect (apart from the truly original and captivating story) of Memento is great. Acting, directing, atmosphere, all are top-notch and with refreshing doses of dark humor a la Coen brothers! Another great proof that big budget is of the lowest importance in making a good movie."

In one scene he forgets the events at that moment even while he is trying not to forget ( while looking for a pen).

I thought it would cover the time from his wife's death until now.  Some people said they needed to see it again to understand it.<br/><br/>What it was:  flashbacks that cover just the last couple days, very obviously connected, neither confusing nor evocative.  The real mystery is revealed in a clumsy last minute exposition spilled by Pantolino.  The only interesting seconds, with some resonance of the frailty of human memory, were when Pearce misremembered his touch to his wife's thigh. <br/><br/>

"freedomsbeat","5","1","2","24 March 2001"," Why didn't Lenny buy a PalmPilot?
","Not to be cynical, but why didn't our hero just buy a laptop or a palmpilot? I mean, the last time I checked, tattoos cost a significant amount of $$ and, well, a PDA would have been much more convenient as well (heck, we know he had the money - why not get a nice digital camera instead of the Polaroid as well). I know I'm being totally trivial here, but a better movie wouldn't have me questioning this.<br/><br/>I was really waiting for this one - the killer reviews and film festival buzz had me running to the theaters on opening day.  Firstly, let me say that I'm now a Guy Pierce fan - the guy simply rocks.  Carrie Ann Moss also surprised me with her very strong performance, and I've always liked Joe Pantolione (sp?) since I saw him in Bound years ago.  Aside from the great acting and occasional surprises (I loved the ""am I chasing him? Oh wait, he's chasing me!"" thing), this movie suffered from being a bit too full of itself. Don't get me wrong, the backwards narrative was an entertaining device- but without this device this movie would simply be your average thriller (a well shot one, but still average). SPOILERS I left the theater with a very, very empty feeling in my stomach.  I almost felt sick.  I love movies, and when a movie presents itself so compellingly as this one did, I literally give the film makers 2 hours of my life: I separate myself from the world and try to get caught up in the world of these characters.  My problem is that the ending didn't justify my attention.  When I go to a suspense thriller, I love to mentally jot down the clues and try to put the puzzle together - there was no puzzle here. Think about it, what in the movie points to the Sammy story being fabricated (other than a near-subliminal shot of Sammy turning into Lenny in the home for the mentally disabled- that's the sort of retarded trick that has people saying `holy cow, it was all there and I missed the frames before! It's ALL there..' Nope.. It's all a trick). NOTHING showed that.  Yes, there were hints that Lenny was being manipulated and yes there were hints that there was a larger conspiracy - great stuff that had me on the edge of my seat till the ending.  But what did we get??  Pseudo-psychological bull about him creating the Sammy story to give him a point of reference that's detached from his own self to hide his guilt and confusion while he goes on to seek revenge for a murder that didn't exist???? Come on people, we're smarter than that! STOP BELIEVING THAT THE INCONSISTENCIES CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY BY THE `HUMAN CONDITION' AND HOW MEMORIES ARE SO ABSTRACT SO WE SHOULDN'T BE CRITICAL OF THE PLOT HOLES IN THIS MOVIE. That's cheating!  At the point we could have been told that he was abducted by alien life-forms and fed false memories so that he would go out and do their evil deeds! It would have made just as much sense (well, ok that's a little far fetched, but you see my point - or I hope you do).<br/><br/>Lastly, think about Pulp Fiction (one of my fav. American movies of the past 10 years): take away the non-linear story line and what do you have? Great characters, an intriguing movie, incredible dialogue and a rich, memorable experience- the movie was enriched by the timeline but it did not MAKE the movie.  Memento, on the other hand, would not exist were it not for the film-school experiment with a backwards narrative.  It was a gimmick that made a hollow movie `work,' much like the big special-fx in ID4 that we art-house fools love to shake our fingers at.  Best movie of the year? Maybe..

"jacob rosen","6","1","2","21 September 2001"," Clever but Taxing
","Christopher Nolan's modern-day noir concerns a man (Guy Pearce) trying to uncover his wife's killers while struggling with short-term memory loss. Since his hero is also the narrator, it's a tricky narrative; but Nolan complicates things even further by unfolding the story backwards. The result is clever but it's also taxing: your mind has to work harder than it necessarily should. Once the novelty wears off, there are plenty of dead spots and impatience sets in--you want to get to the beginning to get a feeling of completion. The result is like watching a big-screen version of `Columbo' where you know the killer at the onset and watch Peter Falk figure out whodunit and why. If that's your cup of tea, this is for you. Pearce is excellent, as usual; also starring is Joe Pantoliano (a pleasure) and an underused Carrie-Anne Moss."

This device is intriguing, and was enough to keep my interest for the first fifteen minutes or so. But once I realized that it wasn't going to stop until the movie was over, I began to go slowly insane.<br/><br/>
Also, the structure implicitly asks you to take it for granted that when you reach to the end, everything is going to make sense in terms of character and motivation. Without going into any details, let me just tell you that it doesn't. <br/><br/>The acting was good, and the writing, in terms of dialogue, was competent.

"jszczepaniakgillece","Null","1","2","19 March 2001"," from a feminist and critical perspective... this film sucks
","I was promised a complex story line, an innovative narrative structure, and a unique metaphor for the human condition.  It's too bad `Memento' came up short on all counts; it's even worse that, for me, its trite and juvenile sexism became the most memorable part of the film. While on a surface reading the story of `Memento' may seem almost incomprehensible, in reality a thin veneer of intrigue hides a simplistic plot.  What many have hailed as comments on the subjective nature of memory I see merely as plot holes.  Perhaps I could accept the `nature of memory' theory if I didn't see so many obvious, silly points: how does he remember the Polaroids? How does he remember he has the condition in the first place? Many other questions arise which I hesitate to write, as they may reveal plot points.  Beautiful editing constructs a puzzle out of nothing; is this the reason I felt so empty leaving the theatre?  All in all, the story is remarkably easy minus the jumps in time. The most intriguing aspect of `Memento' certainly is its exquisite structure.  I applaud the direction and writing for an expert, slick achievement.  Slick, though. hardly indie, too professional.  In the form vs. content debate, `Memento' stands as an argument that neither outweighs the other: gorgeous form, no content makes for a dull experience.  If you construct an amazing shell that holds nothing, well, that's what I'm left with. nothing.  Looks aren't everything.  You have to give me a reason for sitting through it.  As a metaphor, `Memento' is half baked at best.  This whole bit about the human condition I keep reading in reference to the film seems to be an audience construct.  Either that, or Nolan is smart enough to create the hints of a metaphor without creating the actual metaphor (the latter, I suspect, is true), leaving that grand old subjectivity of interpretation clause to the grasps of hungry viewers. Finally, I'd like to ask a question that no one has yet raised: why is this film allowed to represent the virgin/whore dichotomy so plainly. and no one raises his/her voice?  The wife is a pure angelic girl, Natalie a drug-addled manipulative whore, and Sammy's wife a domineering psychopath. You want holy men? We've got plenty, from Lenny to Teddy. There's not much I can say on this count except that I'm sick of it.  I've seen this so many times, and I'm sick of another sexist film (`American Beauty', as a recent example) gaining so many accolades without anyone daring to raise a critical eye.  Thanks, `indie' film, for feeding me another Hollywood movie in disguise.  Your pretty pictures don't fool me.  If you want a good film noir with interesting points, try watching `Le Samourai' or `Purple Noon'. Don't expect much from `Memento' but the same old same old.  Frankly, I'm bored just thinking about it."

","I don't think this will spoil the movie.  I saw what was said on the official website.<br/><br/>So, Leonard avenged his wife's death.  How many times?  As Teddy put it, ""you won't remember.""  Leonard even asks himself how long has it been. The facts that Leonard is tattooing in forward order in black and white cut scenes are the last facts that he needs to draw his conclusions.  So he has been collecting information for awhile.  The conclusions Leonard draws at the end of the film will set up the whole reverse story. It was interesting to start the film at 'Fact 5: Access to drugs' and have him derive 'Fact 5: Drug Dealer'.  What is displayed is the manipulation of Leonard's handicap.  Even though the main characters could be innocent they are all pawns to use him to their ends.  They all make him draw conclusions they plan.  But does their plan work well.  Leonard learns to realize this in reverse, at the end of the film.  To stop it someone will have to be his John G."

The advantage of renting a DVD is that you can explore the inside. Not that the movie was too hard to understand; it's just that the writer/director, Nolan, left so much out. <br/><br/>The special features tell you that that memory-man did indeed cause his wife's death and that he had escaped from an asylum to seek the ""killers"" of his wife. All this is alluded to in the movie but since most of it comes from the Pantoliano character, you don't know what to believe.<br/><br/>The characters played by Pantoliano and Carrie-Ann Moss are especially hard to pin down. When do they lie or tell the truth?<br/><br/>In fact then the audience is intentionally left in the dark the same way memory man is confused. That is the beauty of the movie. Is it necessary to know all during the playing of the story? The answer is no. Because, the not knowing keeps the interest and the concentration level maximized throughout the playing of the tale.

Just pick some of the movies with the highest rating and you will certainly have a good time - if you don't find fine art, you will probably have a good entertainment.<br/><br/>So, I went to see Memento because pure 9 usually stands for masterpiece. And for the first time I was really disappointed with IMDB. Memento is just a trick movie and it's really shameless to compare it with 'Pulp Fiction'. And to rank 'Memento' higher than 'Usual Suspects' is really a crime.<br/><br/>The story is told backwards. Nice touch, but try to tell the same story as usual and you will find it pretty lame and flat. My biggest objection regards the way in which Leonard handles his short-term memory problem. It is really stupid to use tattoos and short handwritten notes on Polaroid photos just to keep your lost memories around... What's wrong with notebooks, computers, and diaries? You don't need to be a psychology expert to see the holes in the story. For example, it seems that short-term memory loss does not affect Leonard's capabilities to use his camera day after day (he is always perfectly aware of what it should be used for).<br/><br/>After the movie I read almost all of the comments posted for ""Memento"" (I thought: ""If I didn't understand it, there are some guys out there who did!""). It was a complete waste of time. More than 95% of comments are mere compilations of superlatives, just simple conclusions without facts. Those who posted possible 'spoilers' didn't spoil a single thing (read them freely).

By the time blood was running up the walls, people were being un-shot and brought back to life, I had the uneasy sense that the 'interesting premise' was a gimmick in disguise. Essentially, this is a high concept film with an independent gloss. It reminds me of nothing more than 'The Limey,' with its messed-up chronology and ambivalent ending.<br/><br/>The movie is solidly put together: evocative, effective cinematography and set design, good acting. The story's events are very easy to follow, no mean feat when they are ordered from last to first, repeating themselves occasionally.<br/><br/>Despite being well-crafted, the film has no emotional core. It's clever, interesting, but is ultimately cold. The protagonist is never frustrated or upset enough to elicit some kind of audience response: he is intriguing, but doesn't provoke any sympathy.

I understand that the idea was to make the viewer as confused as the main character (which was incedentially very well acted by Guy Pearce surprinsly), but it was nearly impossible to follow what was happened unless you paid 100% attention and had the right mind, or you wrote down the ideas, or more likely watched it again.<br/><br/>

The idea of a man without a short-term memory is not bad: this could be a wonderful chance to comment on the world, reality, time, out living in time and our representations of it: on the whole multitude of questions that were the focal point of the thoughts and works of philosophers and artists for millenia. Do the creators of this movie even try to do that? No - the story never strays away from a long-trodden path of a sturdy commercial thriller-mystery. Yes, yes - reverse order, unknown past instead of unknown future etc., but this all looks to me like using a statue as a hammer. What makes you think about anything in this movie: some reviewers claim to go on thinking about it for days - about what? If you really want some deep insights into the nature of time and memory, try Immanuil Kant or Upanishads - don't try to get them from this source.<br/><br/>Now after all that I cannot deny that this is a well-made mystery film, the actors are really good, the suspense is there, and it's quite worthy of a higher-than-average review.

"tasunder","Null","1","2","29 May 2001"," Good but not great - loses coherency towards the end
","Memento manages to transcend above a mere ""gimmick"" movie into a movie experience that is quite enjoyable, but not a masterpiece.  However, it is not the 9th best film of all time (it is currently #9 on imdb), nor is it even one of the best films in the past year.<br/><br/>Memento tries to accomplish too much, and the effect is that many things that are normally ""given"" in a film like this are not accomplished at all. The so-called gimmick itself is brilliant.  I can't agree with people who demean the quality of this film simply because it uses a gimmick to tell the story.  If one sees enough movies, one begins to appreciate unique styles of storytelling, even if the underlying plot is lacking (in this case, only slightly).  Furthermore, the plot itself is generally quite enjoyable and suspenseful.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film, though;  what separates it in my mind from great films, is that there appear to be numerous plot holes.  Some can be patched with some blanket statements about memory and perception (which though they work feel cheap), but some just nag at you and make you feel cheated.  The other problem, and this was really the major one for me, is that Memento seems to follow the now endless stream of movies that feel they have to surprise the viewer a lot.  In some places it really works in memento.  In others, you feel really cheated, as if you have watched 1 hour of viewing that is entirely invalidated by a plot twist.  Initially I thought this was true of films like Fight Club and so forth, but on subsequent viewings or upon thinking further, these other films actually end up making sense.  In Fight Club, in fact, once I got over the feeling of being cheated, once I watched it again, the movie was even better. <br/><br/>
Memento, on the other hand, will not offer me much on subsequent viewings. There is no deeper meaning to most of what is there, it's all plot and intrigue.  Watching it again, I would simply be looking for ""aha"" moments. Watching films like Fight Club, ExistenZ, Pi, Run Lola Run, the Sixth Sense, and the Usual Suspects again, I can appreciate the film still, perhaps even more.  I am liberated by knowing what will happen, and able to pay attention to details more, able to see more in the plot than was there before.  I can marvel at the composition of scenes, the camerawork, and so forth.  Memento, on the other hand, is just what it wants to be, a mystery/suspense movie told in a unique way.  It is not elevated by its method of storytelling.  It does not demonstrate technical excellence (or if it does, I do not perceive it).<br/><br/>Stated in another way, I feel as though memento became too enveloped in its method of storytelling and need to surprise - a need that is certainly understandable if the audience's attention is to remain constant - such that the plot began to suffer towards the end.  The plot became so loose that at some point I began questioning the plausibility of the story, and thinking that the main character was stupid and his method of dealing with his disability was lacking.  Part of this can again be explained by blanket statements, but they can also be explained by loose writing."

Guy Pearce, plays Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from short term memory loss after being  hit on the head, trying to save his wife.  Although he remembers everything before the accident, he can only remember things for about 15 minutes at a time afterwards, so he keeps the clues through a series of polaroids, notes and tattoos. The film is told in a series of segments, starting at the end and moving back to the beginning, with a wraparound scene in between each segment.  By telling the story like this, it effectively places the audience in Leonard's shoes, we can see what's happening and know what's going to happen, but we don't know what led up to it, just as Leonard doesn't know. The film sports great performances from Pearce, Joe Pantoliano as Teddy, the shady character that could be a friend or foe and Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, who seems to want to help Leonard. All in all this is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, not wondering what's going to happen next, but what happened before.

","""Memento"" is tough to pin down.  The gimmick is generally great, but it's the only good thing about the film.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a former insurance investigator with a condition (""severe anterograde memory dysfunction"", for those of you en route to med school) that leaves him unable to form any memories.  He introduces himself to people he's met dozens of times, he writes down anything he hopes to remember (as basic as where he's driving his car to), and tattoos the real important stuff all over his body.  The only thing he can remember is the home invasion that left him with his condition, and his drive to kill the man who raped and murdered his wife.<br/><br/>Given this, it almost makes sense that the film plays in reverse.  The opening scene shows Leonard gunning down a man in cold blood; in the next scene that same man is alive, and we learn a (very little) bit about why Leonard has done this deed (he has a Polaroid of the man; on the back is written ""Don't believe his lies.  He is the one.  Kill him."").  And this is the way the movie plays, with the last line of every scene being a repeat of the first line of the previous scene.<br/><br/>It fits quite smartly, since the camera never leaves our hero.  We're stuck in his world.  He has no memory with which to process the events he lives, why should we?  There is no way we could sympathize with this character if ""Memento"" played forward, so reverse it is.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, if this story played forward, it would have a hatful of other problems also.  If it didn't follow the film noir playbook to the letter, it could at least keep the viewer working on untangling the confusion.  As it is, however, the viewer is constantly two scenes ahead of the movie.  When each bombshell is dropped about what's really up with the characters (when you boil it down, the film only has three), you're not the least bit surprised.  You've already seen the last of them, so it's generally obvious how they got into the film in the first place, when considered in the context of Teddy's (played cleverly by Joe Pantoliano) death at the beginning/end.  Even if you're not sitting in the theater playing detective, when director Christopher Nolan tells you the real dirt on Leonard/Teddy/Natalie, any surprise you may experience will be tempered with the realization that it couldn't have been any other way.<br/><br/>It's been suggested to me that this film requires repeat viewings.  I feel quite the opposite; that the extremely pedestrian nature of the storyline can't be disguised once you're in on it.  Leonard has no memory; you do. As it was, I found this movie pleasant enough, but more for novelty than any more conventional qualities of a film.  2 1/2 stars."

"johnnymonsarrat","10","1","2","13 April 2002"," Jon Monsarrat review: arty but accessible & great thriller
","Like ""Training Day"", Memento is that rare gem that succeeds both as a pure arty drama film (not my kind of movie) and as an action / thriller (that's more my style).<br/><br/>The film is original, very very original, and fascinating. Although there's no blood / gore, it is too scary for young kids, but besides that: perfect. The acting is great. Guy Pearce is definitely headed for an Academy Award at some point. The cinematography and editing are out-of-this-world fantastic. The story doesn't exactly have ""something to say that changed my life"" (see ""October Sky"", ""Dead Poets' Society"", and ""Contact"") but there are plenty of deep thinking intellectual issues.<br/><br/>One caveat: you will need to have your brain 100% alert to get the full impact of the film. For me, I loved that, but if you prefer to relax and just go with the flow you will probably get a little lost.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Everybody, it's safe for arty types who don't normally see thrillers<br/><br/>-- Everybody, it's safe for action buffs who hate arty dramas.<br/><br/>If you normally hate over-intellectual films that make you think too much, but you had to see one in your life, see this one.<br/><br/>I'll give ""Memento"" a well-deserved 10 out of 10."
"Larry_C_Ellis","Null","1","2","9 April 2002"," A fascinating puzzle
","This film is a sequence of vignettes, shown in reverse chronological order, through which a murder mystery begins to unfold.   The end of each newly witnessed scene takes us to where the prior one ends.  Since the edges of the scenes overlap by a few seconds, we are able to piece them together to form a continuum.<br/><br/>Brilliant in concept, well executed and well acted, this film is a spellbinding puzzle that is engrossing from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Some critics of the film complain that the film's story would be simple-minded and uninteresting if viewed in normal time.  I don't agree. In any case, the film's `backwards' format poses certain limits on story complexity because of the extra mental effort we must go through to piece the puzzle together.  I think the film achieves a perfectly reasonable balance, considering these constraints.<br/><br/>Others say that there are flaws in the plotline; however I believe that a second viewing will convince most observers that there are explanations for most, if not all, perceived anomalies.<br/><br/>As Leonard Shelby, Guy Pierce delivers a fine, low-key performance:  that of a man whose emotions are sometimes grayed by the trauma of a life that has come unraveled.  Shelby is a man who is not completely innocent, but his life has become such a nightmare that he we feel sympathy for him nonetheless.<br/><br/>However the finest performance of the film is by Carrie-Anne Moss.  In the character of Natalie, Leonard's flawed and tragic soul mate, she embodies anger, hatred, vindictiveness, sadness, compassion, and desperation.   And all are portrayed without a single false note.<br/><br/>The movie is not perfect, and not for everyone, but I found it well worth the viewing."

","How do you tell the story of a man with absolutely no memory who is trying to solve a mystery by obtaining information he can't even remember? You do it by putting the audience in the exact same situation as the character.<br/><br/>Guy Pierce's Leonard is sure only that an assault resulted in the murder of his wife and a head injury that robbed him of his short-term memory. And he is obsessed with finding her killer. But an inability to remember events from even 5 minutes ago is the ultimate monkey wrench in the works. So Leonard documents his search for clues with photos and scribbled notes, realizing that in a few minutes, he won't even remember what they mean.<br/><br/>We see everything from Leonard's perspective: photos, notes and people that mean little to us until we-and Leonard-receive more information that we can remember but he can't. Constant flashbacks reveal the significance of the clues that Leonard carries with him. Where we differ with Leonard is that we can slowly piece everything together by the accumulation of facts that literally seem to go in one ear and out the other for Leonard. The search for clues and the meaning behind them becomes as fascinating for the viewer as it is frustrating for Leonard. A very unique, very-interesting story."
"marvelous-marv","9","1","2","6 April 2002"," A very original plot and screenplay, even groundbreaking
","This film is for those who like mysteries, or are in school to learn how to make a good film script, or who are at least of average intelligence.  The lower life forms, such as NASCAR/Wrestling fans and bowlers need not apply --- go see The Flintstones, Part 8 in 3D.  <br/><br/>I have never had the pleasure of watching a film which progressed completely backwards in time & frame sequence.  You could literally watch this film from the last scene to the first and it would make sense, maybe even more sense, except of course that you would watch the true ending first and spoil it for yourself.  What's really cool is that there's a slight narrative story within the story that is moving forward --- it's really ingenious.<br/><br/>This is a classic in the making; completely original in all aspects.  This is something that I'm sure Hitchcock would have liked to do if he or anybody had thought of it before.  There are plot holes, but incredibly, you don't notice them badly and they don't have to be resolved to enjoy the film.  The script even mentions at least one, and you have to stop and think for a moment to find the others --- if Leonard can make no new memories, what good is a revenge killing if he won't remember the satisfaction of it, or even if he has even exacted revenge already --- in fact, what good is doing anything other than just existing and waiting for a cure, but then you wouldn't have a movie, eh?  These questions were posed by the story which inspired the film and of course were omitted for sake of argument and they do not spoil the continuity one bit.  <br/><br/>The introduction of certain elements of the plot are not mentioned and left up to the viewer to decipher, and another big hole --- if Leonard can't remember anything, how does he remember how to drive a car, how does he even know that the Polaroids he takes are in his pocket, and how does he know about anything he has done more than 30 minutes ago which are essential to functioning in life in general?  There are also elements of certain characters that fail to resolve themselves, but you can live with them as well --- what you get in return is a heckuva neo-Noir flick that deserves your attention.<br/><br/>If you will suspend belief as you should when you see any film and manage to hold on for the first 30 minutes until the plot thickens, you will get an incredible payoff.  In fact, this will be a film that you will want to watch again the very moment it ends to take stock of what just happened and the time frames and appreciate the mastery of the plot & screenplay fully and even discuss what you just saw with someone, as you may have a time figuring out what you just saw!  The filmmakers left a little of the story in your hands to allow you to decide what you just saw, but not so much (like ""K-PAX"") that you feel like you were left with an incomplete storyline.<br/><br/>Thumbs straight up on this one, and you MUST get the DVD version to really appreciate this film."
"digrate","10","1","2","21 March 2002"," An explanation, plus a defense of two main criticisms
","This review probably won't mean much if you haven't seen the movie.<br/><br/>I've seen a bunch of reviews of this, and so far, I haven't seen this explanation for why it was shot chronologically backwards (sorry if it was to whomever else wrote it down first - the point is, I figured this out on my own). While it does help artistically (making the viewer sympathize with the lead by having to constantly reconstruct the past, and being constantly confused), it creates an even more practical simulation of the story. If the movie were shot forwards, the viewer would then remember the past - why things happened, who characters are. However, by shooting it backwards, viewers do not remember the past, like the character. It allows the viewer to watch each scene with no memory of the preceding events. SPOILER - Would you have reacted the same way to Natalie crying with blood on her face the same way if you knew it was Leonard who did it? Exactly. This technique allows for plot twists like that one by not letting the audience know the important info Leonard doesn't. This technique probably had many purposes, although I think the others were included after the decision to shoot backwards for this reason.<br/><br/>The most amazing artistic part of the movie, however, was its ability to create suspense by going backwards in time. SPOILER - I was gripped by the one note that drove most of the plot: the first about Teddy: ""do not believe his lies"". The movie was unconventional, but there was great suspense (for me, at least) about the origin of that note, since all the others came out of that one. Why would Teddy be lying? Couldn't his advice have been valid, too? I was dying to know during the second half. Everyone who said there is no suspense were obviously not willing to commit to the movie. The movie doesn't leave neon signs; You have to do a bit of thinking on your own. There was more to the movie than exploring a self-imposed limitation. There was suspense and mystery that required attention for true benefit. Considering the unconventional narrative structure, this movie was seamless in plot. Many complain ""how can he remember his condition if he found out about it after the injury?"", but remember, his condition, unlike Sammy's, was physical. He could remember things through instinct and repetition (checking the hotel night stand when he woke up). He could have made a note about his condition early, on, but I'd assume he'd have had to use it a lot (read: repetitively). That routine of explaining himself to everyone new - to him, everyone - could have become instinct, like opening the drawer, and he would have remembered it. Eat that! This was one of the most creative, artistically innovative movies since 2001: A Space Odyssey."

I wanted to rip Mr. Nolan's lungs out when this movie was over, since I have been fighting a battle to stop people within my own damned family from treating me like I'm some kind of invalid for the past few years. Considering that diabetes afflicts one in every hundred people in the world (this translates into about 300 or so million people), and of that percentage, another one in every hundred is insulin dependent, the fact that this film got made is another testament to how low an opinion mainstream directors and writers have of our intelligence.<br/><br/>The first thing I did when I left the theatre, other than recover from the urge to punch people who were talking about this film as if it was made with one shred of intelligence, was apologise to members of my family for talking them into seeing this piece of dung. As a mental patient, films come out all the time that mis-represent me and thousands of others like me. I'm used to that. But next time you hear someone say this film is a masterpiece, consider the fact that if I didn't have diabetes, I could very easily win boxing matches with the likes of Liam Neeson or David Prowse in spite of the fact that they are half to one foot taller than me.

Every single moment of this movie is gripping. I'm convinced you can watch it ad infinitum and still discover new and eye-opening nuggets each viewing. Guy Pearce is pitch perfect, and Carrie-Anne Moss is so diabolically stunning she's scary. Joey Pants with the comic relief is what seals this as hands-down one of the most interesting and well-conceived and executed films of the 2000's. Adapted from a story that Nolan's brother wrote, this whole movie feels so personal - despite it's oddball topic. Just watch the mystery unfold here, as it deepens with each passing minute.

He has taken to tattooing clues on his body, so not to ever lose them. This movie is told from a different perspective that i do not believe has been repeated, in reverse. It is a great story and one that you need to pay attention to. It will linger on you mind long after having watched it. The ending is probably the best part.

2- The Goal (4 out of 10): The idea behind the movie is very good .. really good which is that the ""human is just memories"" BUT actually it is messed up for me because of the bad way that the movie goes on it.
3- The Excitement: (2 out of 10): where is it? oh! i found it on the beginning only, then Nothing but boredom.
4- The influence: (1 out of 10): Not that way please nothing affected me , i already know the bad guy from the beginning why i should affected by the events then?.

Memento is written very smartly (credit to his brother Jonathon Nolan) and one of the best mystery/thrillers of all time. Not because of the gore or being action packed, but because of how its set out by being backwards which is connecting us to the main character Leonard (Guy Pearce was also perfect) with short term memory loss and because the movie set out to be confusing on purpose I felt connected to the character and put me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. <br/><br/>Note please watch this two or three to have a full understanding on what Memento really means because it can get confusing."

","It might be the most mind-bending Nolan-movie to date, and it truly is spectacular.<br/><br/>After seeing all the other masterpieces by C Nolan, I thought it was time to watch his first big movie; Memento. The non-linear structure and the constant character motivations is a classic trait by Nolan. Memento is no exception. The first time I saw this movie I didn't really understand all of it. I only gave this movie a 5/10. But after watching it again and experienced the grasp of Memento am I totally convinced that this really is a blockbuster. The movie is so refreshing with its unique structure and excellent actors. The plot is very solid and because we're talking about a man that can't make new memories is this movie even greater. Because of the unique structure; the audience is forgetting what they just saw. It's the same with the main character. That tight connection between the audience and the movie makes this movie wonderful. But you really need to pay attention. If you miss something you risk missing the greater importance. And if you do; watch it again! Memento really is a fabulous movie. The cinematography is very smooth and the acting is phenomenal. There's really nothing bad about it. It's one interesting, deep and flawless movie. It even got the classic Nolan-ending, the part of the movie that has the most plot-twists.<br/><br/>People may say Interstellar is too ambitious; but Memento isn't? Memento is one refreshing, awesome and non-linear thriller that's highly enjoyable. But not as great as his newer creations.<br/><br/>9/10"

It's going backwards obviously, but, there are many things questionable, it represents the riddle life the protagonist lives, the movie goes on from only one perspective, the And-ill protagonist's perspective, you see things according to his mind, to his eyes, and one of the cleverest things to do is to make things go backwards to really feel the puzzle dizzy you around. <br/><br/>I wonder how long it took 'em to write, edit and even flawless-ize this movie ?

"filipemanuelneto","7","1","3","20 February 2017"," Unorthodox, creative but sometimes disappointing.
","This was undoubtedly one of the most original and creative films I've ever seen. It's not a perfect movie, it's not great, but it's good. The whole story revolves around a man who has suffered a brain injury that makes impossible for him to keep long-term memory from that moment on. He is, however, committed to discovering and punishing a murderer, resorting to post-it notes, tattoos and Polaroid photographs, where he notes what he has discovered. Its an interesting concept, later revisited in ""Before I go to Sleep"", film that approaches a similar story. The way the narrative is constructed, with multiple linearity twists, helps to thicken the mystery and hold our attention but it can have the opposite effect on people who don't understand the film right from the start. And this happens because, from the middle, the movie loses rhythm and interest. The ending works well but it can really disappoint, just as it disappointed me. I did not want the ending to be the way it was. Guy Pearce is the protagonist and did a reasonable job, as well as the generality of the cast, but the film is not exactly a dramatic show for any actor. Its worth, essentially, by the original story that tells."
"CinematicInceptions","9","1","3","5 January 2017"," Surprising in multiple ways. Fabulous without being flashy.
","I was not expecting this movie to have such an emotional theme to it, but I was happy that it did. Most thrillers and stories that center around murders and revenge are not that emotionally compelling. Their appeal tends to come more from the mystery of the story and the shock factor of revelations. Memento is not lacking one bit in this area, but goes a step further by delivering on an emotional level and perhaps even making us question the way we go through life.<br/><br/>Leonard's condition is a unique one that the majority of audiences have no experience with, but he's really no different than the rest of us. He just has a diagnosis to highlight it. All of us stumble through life with misconceptions because of the limited information we have. Leonard has to deal with the same thing, just on a heightened level. His solution is good in theory: only rely on facts. But by the end we realize that ""fact"" can be a malleable thing. Once Leonard decides that Teddy is his ""John G."", it does not really matter whether Teddy is his wife's murderer. That's Leonard's reality and he doesn't let himself think twice about it. Self -deception like the kind seen in this film can be beneficial as much as it can be harmful, but it was more powerful and striking to have the story end in tragedy.<br/><br/>The backward progression, while it may seem like a gimmick at first glance, was definitely a good move. The nature of the story called for it to be told in reverse. Watching Memento in chronological order would probably make more sense, but it would end up being a rather dry story. Most of the mystery and drama would be lost.<br/><br/>Our characters were not the most enjoyable to see on screen, but I think they were created well. Teddy, Leonard, and Natalie are actually pretty normal people without any personal qualities that made me like them. But all three of them had motives, flaws, and emotions like real people do, which made the movie as a whole better. It just wasn't shown in a flashy way that called for any great acting performances or snappy dialogue.<br/><br/>This is an excellent pick if you like thrillers and if you like non-linear story telling. If you like guessing the ending of movies and bragging to your friends about how good you are at predicting how things will play out, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. While there is a fabulous twist ending that will drop your jaw without resorting to fanfare, it is not the kind of twist that can be predicted based on what has already been shown. It's a very psychological story, which is what I love about it, but I know some people prefer more straightforward and external story structures. So just be aware of that. One final caution: this is not the type of movie that will gross you out or make your stomach turn with vicious murders and gore, but it could be emotionally upsetting. You will not feel hopeful at the end. All the same, enjoy! Overall Rating: 8.9/10."

But not in an especially good way, as it became wearying to the point of apathy -- I stopped caring what had really happened, the kiss of death in what should have been a psychological thriller. I like Carrie Moss as an actress, but her character in this film was uninteresting -- I stopped caring about her. I also really like Joey Pants as well, but as good as his performance was, even he couldn't make the movie worth it. After struggling to keep watching the movie, overall I found it trite, unsatisfying, and not worth the time spent.

","Mind-bogglingly, breath-takingly brilliant - insanely original and intelligent.<br/><br/>A man, Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) has just shot and killed another man. Why did he do it? Through scenes shown in reverse order (with individual scenes separated by another set of scenes shown in forward order), we unravel the mystery.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan's second movie. His first, Following, was great and showed his penchant for clever, original plots. Here he exceeded himself - Memento is probably the cleverest, most original movie you'll ever see.<br/><br/>The reverse order thing is a brilliant concept in itself, and as far as I know the only other movie to try it was Irreversible by Gaspar Noe (released after Memento, so Memento did it first). Irreversible was much more simple in its method - just play the scenes in reverse order. <br/><br/>However, with Memento, Nolan goes one step further. By having intermittent forward-moving scenes he helps add backstory. These eventually meet the backward-moving scenes, closing the continuity loop and making for a seamless, continuous story. <br/><br/>Furthermore, it is not the reverse order of the scenes alone that make this movie brilliant. Reverse order scenes without a solid plot behind them would just be a gimmick, and this is certainly no gimmicky movie. The plot itself is brilliant, and ultimately explains why we have to see the scenes backwards.<br/><br/>Moreover, despite the enormous complexity of writing and staging such a concept, in the end everything fits and makes sense. Nolan also leaves just enough ambiguity and mystery behind so you can fill in your own theories and backstories.<br/><br/>This movie deserves every superlative a movie can get."

","(I am primarily reviewing this right now because I heard the film rights of 'Memento' have been bought and a remake is in production. In summation, there is no need to remake that which is perfect.)<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan is a director that has become far too popular for his own good. After making the landmark film 'The Dark Knight' he essentially doomed the rest of his career to be compared to this film. He became so popular that hating him seems to be 'the cool thing to do' now because whenever something is popular, it inevitably gets backlash.<br/><br/>I would like to take you back to 2000. Forget everything you know about this director, his work, and Hollywood. I am a fan of Nolan but disregard this as I write this review, because anyone who likes his work is flagged as being a 'fanboy/fangirl' and the sheer amount of stupidity that it takes to assume that I would like a film because of whoever's name is on it is so incredibly vapid and idiotic that I might have an aneurysm. <br/><br/>So anyway, Memento is about as close to 'perfection' as you can get.<br/><br/>The less is said about the film's plot the better, if you haven't been alerted as to this movie's ending you should stop reading this and watch the film right now. Cherish the element of surprise. In a nutshell, it is about a man who cannot form short-term memories. He is also attempting to solve his wife's murder, and has a very... unique way of keeping track of everything that he can't remember. The story shows him going through various locations and people that may or may not be leading him the right direction, as well as helping some people with their own issues. Also, the story is played in reverse chronological order AND chronological order, Black and White scenes are in order, color scenes are reversed.<br/><br/>This simple and ingenious idea not only lets us see this story in a unique way, but lets us see it in the way the protagonist sees it. Its confusing, its difficult to decipher, but thats the point, we feel the same way he does. We understand him. But like him, as the mystery of the film unravels, the mystery that IS the film unravels as well.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view the film is incredible. Interesting to see how talented Nolan was with a camera even back then, the shots are beautifully composed, the editing is absolutely phenomenal at conveying both the confusion and the understanding that you and the protagonist go though, and the acting is stellar. Guy Pearce is phenomenal, having to change his emotions and overall state on the fly in every scene is impressive, but the sheer skill he has of reading his more expository lines with such confidence makes me wonder why I don't see him in films more often. I can't decide whether or not this or LA Confidential is his best performance. Carrie Anne Moss also does a phenomenal job, and every other actor, while briefly in the film, plays their part very well, as set-pieces that we go through to uncover the mystery.<br/><br/>The amount of detail and film devices Nolan employs is borderline absurd. Not only do you want to watch the film over and over to understand the chronology, but also the MEANING of everything. There are so many things in the dialogue, the shots, the foreground and background, that allude to elements of the plot, Nolan rewards those who look carefully.<br/><br/>Memento, as a film, is a wonderful experience and an absolute required for any fan of mysteries, as well as good cinema in general. While I love the vast majority of his work, I still believe Memento is his 'best' film. It did something daring to make an already captivating and heartbreaking story more interesting, and the best part is, the way he does it is purely through film. This movie could not have been accomplished in any other medium. Had anyone else made it, it simply wouldn't have been as good.<br/><br/>This, Hollywood, is why this film should not be remade. Even if the remake is good, it would be ultimately redundant. You can't fix what ain't broken, and Memento ain't broken."

","Many critics have expressed the view that the backwards chronological order of the colour sequences of Memento is nothing more than a gimmick, a story-telling device that doesn't align with Leonard's point of view. After all, he certainly doesn't experience events in backwards order, does he? However, this structure is crucial in many ways in Memento presenting its story. The narrative is fundamentally about self deception and betrayal; Leonard sees it from everyone he knows, right down to the inn manager who tries to rent him two rooms and freely admits to it, knowing Leonard won't remember. The structure deliberately denies the audience the same information that Leonard is denied as a result of his condition, and slowly subverts initial expectations and reveals facts as lies, as the motif of memory is constantly discussed. Leonard doesn't trust himself or his memory - he works on instincts and conditioning, and most of all, the little notes and tattoos he carries. The audience, much like Leonard, willfully submits to their truth. Playing Memento chronologically would remove this set-up and all the confusion and suspense that he rightly feels. Tt would remove the emotional payoff and complexity in the scene which foreshadows his darker motivations, where he hires a hooker to arrange a room and wake him up, yearning for one small moment where his wife still might be alive. <br/><br/>Dorn edits with precision within these colour segments in order to nod to the backwards order, if the first scene doesn't immediately tell us that, or an alive Teddy right after his death. Key actions and scenarios from the end (and thus beginning) of each scene are neatly stitched together to portray the cause and effect of Leonard's journey and the instructions of his mementos. But the reveal of each character's deception of Lenny (including himself) would not be as effective without the excellent casting. The film comes right after the hugely successful Matrix, where Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano play a trustworthy protagonist and deceptive antagonist respectively. The genius of this is that it subconsciously sets up our expectations for these two characters; we know nothing about them, like Lenny, so we are forced to trust the little notes and clues and their performances. Moss plays a wonderfully exposed and vulnerable character, stumbling into the house with signs of injury...before it is later revealed that it was Lenny who inflicted them as she hurled profanities and insults at him. Teddy is shown to be the villain from the very first scene but later is revealed to be assisting Leonard's quest for revenge. Of course, they aren't too cut and dry. Teddy's corruption and drug deals slides seamlessly into the Natalie's side of the story; he shows manipulative (phone calls) but also caring actions towards Lenny. Natalie, realising that Lenny doesn't remember anything about acquiring her dead boyfriend's car and clothes, sleeps with him. <br/><br/>Of course the backwards colour scenes would not have the same effect if they weren't separated and paced by the chronological black and white scenes, which start with the opposite tone. Whereas every colour scene Leonard wakes up with no memory and has to restart his brain and focus on his next move, the B&Ws start with an almost objective sense. Nolan shoots in a documentary-like style, the almost droning voice-over of Lenny feels like reading a script, narrating a story or sound-bites from an interview. Extreme close ups demonstrate disorientation and confusion while the overhead, surveillance camera-like angle focuses the scene objectively. They start with Leonard almost devoid of motivation or outside intrusion, but slowly shift throughout the film, as he begins to question who exactly he is speaking to on the phone and what he is being asked to do. This sets up the culmination of the two levels converging into a very clever shot where the colour emerges just as Leonard shakes the polaroid. <br/><br/>There's been plenty of debate on the veracity of Teddy's confession in Memento's climax. Taking it as it is, it's the catalyst for the movie's themes to converge and manifest into the decision of Leonard to start the whole chase for Teddy, which ends with his death at the start of the film. Having being deceived by ever other character himself, he deliberately sets up his own deception and consciously alters the truth. He burns the evidence of the two former John Gs (who knows how many have been erased) and decides on a new John G. Like waking up to his deceased wife's mementos and thinking for a fleeting second that she is alive, Leonard yearns for that same satisfaction in revenge. He conditions himself to believe so - my wife wasn't diabetic, he says, as his memory flickers and the insulin needle is altered to a finger, or the very quick flash of himself in the mental institution instead of Sammy. But that's okay - his memory has covered up those instances. It's a remarkable transition from the sometimes clueless but passionately motivated Lenny that Guy Pearce delivers from the beginning. <br/><br/>Memento is tightly wound - it's edits never linger for more than the necessary time in order to orientate its audience for just the tiny amount - it's paramount for us to be as confused as Leonard, even as we slowly unlock the puzzle. Every note, tattoo or fragment of information is then disclosed with much more suspense and revelation than a chronological structure would allow. Each 10 minute memory segment then is able to build and sustain upon the twist ending with haunting implications. How many more Teddys? How many more John Gs?"

","'Memento' is a film that takes you on a ride along with its protagonist who has a medical condition which makes him experience short term memory loss constantly. Nolan manages to make this ride incredibly special by using a very interesting and effective method, which was to tweak the screenplay in a way which will ensure that the viewer is allowed as much exposition as the protagonist himself. We are never allowed too much exposition and the result is a fascinating film that messes with the viewer, no matter how many times he/she chooses to watch it.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Memento is a technical masterpiece. The non- linear screenplay, the editing, the cinematography and the direction of each and every scene is just pitch perfect. Nolan messes with the viewer in the same way that other characters mess with Lenny to take advantage of him and make use of his medical condition. 'Memento' demands constant and uninterrupted attention from the viewer, otherwise he/she could easily slip into a state of total confusion as the film is pretty much a puzzle which the viewer has to solve along with Lenny. The non- linear screenplay written by Christopher Nolan based on a short story written by his brother includes two major sections going side by side simultaneously. One section shown in black and white runs in chronological order, while the other section shown in colour runs in reverse order, both the sections move towards each other in time- line throughout the film. They meet right at the end to create a shocking climax to the film. A screenplay as complex as this would have been unimaginably difficult to conceive and execute, but Nolan astonishingly managed to write it and his directorial skills made the constant transitions from one section to the other absolutely seamless. It takes a lot of guts to write and direct a film like this, and when it's only your 2nd major film, the stakes get even higher and Nolan passed the test with flying colours.<br/><br/>The major theme of the film is memory and the subjective(at times) nature of it. We all have certain memories, whose significance, meanings and implications change with time as we gain maturity or as we become aware of other things. In a way, this subjective nature of memory and the whole concept of choosing to remember certain aspects of an incident to derive a specific meaning out of it is dealt with in the most intense and cerebral way in this film. There are some reviews I have read where the reviewers have complained that maybe the non-linear,complex screenplay of the film is the only thing that keeps 'Memento' from being just a puzzle and a standard, ordinary revenge film. I have two arguments against that complaint. Firstly, this film had to have the complex screenplay as Nolan wanted the viewer to experience the same mental inadequacies that Lenny experiences and he wanted the viewer to feel lost at times during the film just like Lenny. Secondly, the film ends in a way which completely changed my perception of it. The ending makes the whole film a tangential metaphor for general existentialism. The film becomes much deeper by conveying that many people will believe in something just to make their lives worth living and give themselves a motivation to go on living in their quest for what they choose to believe, which can be very relevant from the angle of belief in religion and a higher power.<br/><br/>Although Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano come up with good supporting performances, but 'Memento' is Guy Pearce's film. He drives the film forward from the beginning right till the end. He becomes the character Lenny and comes up with a brilliantly convincing performance. He juggles understatement with bursts of intensity beautifully to create the character on screen.<br/><br/>'Memento' was the first Nolan masterpiece and this was the film that made his name. It is much deeper than some people think it is. No matter who you are and how many times you've watched this, 'Memento' will always find a way to keep you transfixed with its mystery and subtle reticence and it lingers in the mind for days and encourages discussions due to the openness of the storyline. It is always immensely re-watchable due to its style. This belongs to the Essential Viewing category."

","I adore this film. Even from the first few minutes I could tell that it was going to be phenomenal. A masterpiece, really. Beyond the complex and intriguing storyline, the editing deserves applause as well. To avoid spoilers, I won't go in depth as to why, but the editing really allows the viewer to understand such a complicated method of storytelling. Though I watched it for the first time a long time ago, I simply could not shake it from the back of my mind, and have since returned to it again and again. It's art, and n matter how many times I watch it I am consistently blown away. It's the type of film that never gets boring to revisit, as it contains so many different meanings and details to discover anew each time. While it is obviously very mentally stimulating, with it's complex plot and all, there's just so much finesse, and it is of such high quality, that it manages to be a fast watch that keeps the viewer engaged the whole way through. A must see if you enjoy film, and honestly a must see for anyone. Memento is an experience not to be missed."
"t-viktor212","10","1","3","20 June 2015"," Clever, dark and distressing
","That is what we can call the ""Nolan effect"". Every time I saw a Nolan movie for the first time I was catched by a feeling of anxiety, almost afraid of what could happen, but also amused by the smartness of the story, except for Interstellar, which is to me so far the less violent of Nolan's works.<br/><br/>Memento has all of these things - a smartly delivered plot, with quite mature contents and a deal of distression - at an exponentially higher level than the other movies. Not only the darkest and most bloody to me, but also the most cleverly shown: with the trick of how we see the sujet, we truly see the movie from Leonard Shelby's perspective, although knowing a little more than himself. What I found interesting was also that even if the ending in the Sujet wasn't chronologically the end, it actually did deliver a 'finale' feeling, which is remarkable. <br/><br/>Being the first Nolan film to get some notoriety, it doesn't have stunning views as the others which are covered by the good acting of all the actors: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss (otherwise seen in 'the Matrix'), Joe Pantoliano and even Stephen Tobolowsky's silent, almost cameo appearance worked well. The music, composed by a composer I never heard before, David Julyan, managed to bring in the right atmosphere.<br/><br/>Homever, remember that even if it has minimal to no gore, this movie is very intense. Some of the flashbacks related to the wife's gruesome murder are disturbing, (MINIMAL SPOILERS BEGIN) and around the middle the plot's on going makes viewers start to expect that Leonard has an even darker backstory that luckily is not what we discover in the movie. (MINIMAL SPOIELRS END) Although also the actual outcome is quite dark. So I suggest a quite deal of courage to watch this movie. Again, this movie is the most intense Nolan movie from his career. On a scale from 1 to 100, If Memento is ranked 100, the dark knight is ranked 45, inception 35, and interstellar 10."

Nolan brothers are geniuses. Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano make a good cast, each one really give the best to their characters. Though Pearce's one is the most difficult and unstable to predict, you get a sense of that guy might actually exist in real life. And to conclude, the end does not explain you nothing solid. And that is good because you can search for your own conclusion. I debated it with many friends and we never reach a common opinion. Claps, claps and more claps for this movie."

"Sonic_Ocean","10","1","3","19 May 2013"," Is ignorance truly bliss?
","The first time I watched Pulp Fiction, it took me a bit of time to fully grasp its nonlinear storytelling by trying to figure out when each event occurred to be able to know the occurrence of events chronologically. Now having watched Memento, I have come to realize that despite Pulp Fiction's unique narrative, Tarantino made a story that is still easy to grasp.<br/><br/>At first I didn't get the memo that Memento presents its story in reverse chronological order, and having figured that out in a few scenes in, it felt like I was falling behind in a race, struggling to catch up. And not only that, but the flashbacks scenes are shown in regular chronological order to make the pace even more insanely hectic for me. I think it is safe to say that everyone can benefit from watching this movie more than once to piece everything together, if one loses track the first time watching it. My first viewing, to say the least, was mindboggling, but thanks to subtitles and having a bit of patience with my second viewing, I managed to tie up a lot of loose ends that were beginning to drive me crazy.<br/><br/>And that's one of the things that makes Nolan such a talented director. When you watch Memento, you have to literally change the way you watch movies to grasp it. It is not a stylistic choice just for the sake of being innovative. Nolan utilizes this reverse storytelling technique to execute the drama in a very unique way, having the same effect as putting a puzzle together to know what the full picture looks like. As we go back into the past, that is when we discover the answer to the mysteries of what is really going on underneath it all, as opposed to a conventional movie where we get the bigger picture of the situation as the story progresses in regular chronological order, followed by a conclusion. Whereas the ending of Pulp Fiction occurs during the middle of all the chaos, we get our true conclusion to Memento at the beginning where everything started. Whereas we know the destiny of every character with Pulp Fiction, there is a bit of uncertainty as to what will happen next for the protagonist.<br/><br/>What I love about Memento is that it perfectly encapsulates the strange feeling of deja vu. While the protagonist is unaware of everything that happens to him, we the viewer begin to see the full picture in the last scene in the movie and we come to a shocking revelation of the events we just witnessed. I don't want to elaborate more and run the risk of potentially spoiling anything, but all I can say is that this is one of the most innovative mystery thrillers concocted by Nolan, and the subtle film noir influences gives it an extra charm. Watching this movie, you wouldn't predict he would he even direct the batman movies and that shows not only Nolan's diversity but also his versatility as a director."

The screenplay is masterful as you are watching the movie from back to front; you get to feel like Leonard himself.<br/><br/>Memento is written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who adapted it from his younger brother Jonathan Nolan's (Person of Interest creator, writer and executive producer) short story ""Memento Mori"".<br/><br/>The brothers started work on the film in 1996 when Jonathan pitched the story to Christopher on a road trip, the two then started to send story and script back and forth as Christopher developed his film from a short story about a man named Earl who is a patient of a mental institution. Earl's wife like Leonard was killed by an anonymous man, and during the attack Earl lost his ability to create new long-term memories and convinces himself through written notes to himself to escape the mental institution and track down and kill his wife murder.<br/><br/>The movie starts at the end and runs till we get to see what led to the end. The movie is told in two different parallel series of scenes, one of which is in black and white and it is shown chronologically, and the other is in colored and shown in a reverse order sequence. The two stories meet at the end of the film, and it shows us what led to the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>The movie plot is about a man named Leonard (Guy Pearce) who has anterograde amnesia, which makes it difficult for him to retain new explicit memories. To be able to keep tab on his life Leonard developed a system where he uses notes, tattoos and Polaroid photos to be able to track where he is and who he knows and what he is doing or about to do.<br/><br/>Leonard's problem started when he got hit in the head when he witnessed his wife being raped and murdered; now Leonard has only one goal in life to track down a certain John G who he believes killed his wife.<br/><br/>Rated as one of the best movies in the 2000s, Memento is featured in notable lists of top films. Memento was very successful at the box office making almost 10 times its production cost and placing Nolan's name in the lips of many production studios, inclusive of Warner Bros where Christopher Nolan made The Batman Trilogy and will be working with them for the making of the new Superman film named Man of Steel in 2013.<br/><br/>Memento received numerous accolades and got two Academy Awards nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing.

The only question I was really left with was, what happens now? Does the vicious cycle just continue on forever, will there ever be an end? However you have to realise that that is the point in the film, your left with as few answers as the main character, and thats what makes it such an interesting journey.<br/><br/>Acting in this film was generally good, nothing too special as its this idea of the complexity of the storyline that carries the film forward, but needless to say the relatively small cast pulls the job off well, but I found myself never sure what I was supposed to think of a character, this seems to be the point in the film though.<br/><br/>In general I enjoyed this film and really enjoyed the strange perspective used, that is not really evident in other movies."
"asda-man","10","1","3","24 February 2012"," You won't forget this one!
","I'm quite convinced that Christopher Nolan is not a man at all, but is in fact a movie-making machine. I don't believe that it's humanly possible to make films that are just so insanely clever as ""Inception"" or ""Memento"". Christopher Nolan even manages to make Batman seem clever, and you know how that originally started out. I saw ""Memento"" for the second time yesterday and its incredibly complex writing blew me away if not more so that the first time. I was awe-struck the first time that I watched ""Memento"", not only at the screenplay, but at the directing and acting also.<br/><br/>If a film like ""Memento"" had been placed in the hands of any other director then it very easily could've turned into a confused and boring mess. Like, ""Inception"" Christopher Nolan deals with complex ideas that are very rarely seen in the movie world, but he handles them with such careful control and sophistication that they end up being some of the most mind-blowing films ever! Watching ""Memento"" with my parents was an experience in itself. To understand ""Memento"" you need a mind that is prepared to not just watch a film, but to be a part of it. Because ""Memento"" is placed in a backward order, you need to figure out and remember what's happened before a scene and try and piece the mystery together yourself.<br/><br/>In hindsight this might seem like just a gimmick. But, ""Memento"" couldn't be told any other way, as it leaves you being confused as much as Leonard. It places you in Leonard's mind so that you don't know what's happened, like Leonard doesn't know. However, to follow the mystery we have to go back to see what has happened and Christopher Nolan uses this to his advantage and is able to create an extremely clever and complex mystery with an ending to die for. However, my parents failed to realise this. They were asking questions like ""why's he still alive, he was shot a minute ago!"" They just didn't get the idea of telling the story backward and the ending just left their mind in a graveyard! Luckily I didn't watch it with them the first time, so the second time was more amusing.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan's directing is also just as brilliant. He manages to place us into the mind of Leonard through excellent uses of narration and also completely gripping black and white sequence which is like a short film in itself. Guy Pearce is also brilliant at playing Leonard, it makes you wonder if he's got the same condition as Leonard! (He doesn't, just for the record.) Chrstopher often places us in the eyes of Leonard and so we suffer the same problems as him. ""Memento"" is like an experience that leaves you mentally exhausted.<br/><br/>""Memento"" is one of the best films I have ever seen and is probably in my Top 10 list of the best films I have seen. It's beautifully written and directed and had me completely engrossed from the minute it started. It's also an excellent character piece, with people we can care about. It's thrilling, enthralling and involving. ""Memento"" is the perfect thriller, told in such a way that it's difficult to forget. If you have a fantastic attention span and are prepared to really concentrate in your films then you won't be disappointed with ""Memento""."
"hasan0811-292-607267","9","1","3","17 February 2012"," Great and Entertaining Film ... with some crucial flaws.
","""Memento"" is more of an evolutionary film than revolutionary, adding a slightly different dimension to what other films have already done before, such as ""Pulp Fiction"", in presenting it out of chronological sequence, with two different running stories, one going forward in time and the other backwards, relating the story of a man with a memory condition unable to create new memories and seeking vengeance for the murder and rape of his wife.<br/><br/>""Memento"" is an extremely entertaining movie for those that like a film that makes them think a bit, and though many people would regard Christopher Nolan as just using a gimmick of using reverse chronological order to cover up what would be a pretty boring plot,this is a pretty foolish remark as Christopher Nolan designed the whole film specifically so that it could be portrayed backwards, hence no-one should even consider if the plot would be just as good if played in chronological order as the whole structure of the story would've been different to accommodate such a change. However, ""Memento"" still has some major flaws that I feel really hold it back from being a truly great film. Though the film does engage the viewer's interest through the suspense built up before, it would have held the viewer's interest much better if the central character was someone that the viewer could feel sympathy for, making them want to know what happens to him, which would have made the twist at the end far more unexpected. As well as this it can be seen that at the end, no matter how many different answers people may come up with to try and cover these questions up, there are still many unanswered questions with some unsatisfactory answers to others which was not Nolan's intention as he himself said that all the answers should be within the film. But though many other people would describe it as being riddled with plot holes there aren't many, if any, of these, such as the common misconception that he shouldn't even be able to remember that he has Anterograde Amnesia, which is actually untrue as can be seen with real-life patients who have the condition. The acting is pretty good throughout, especially from Joey Pantoliano and Guy Pearce who really perform their roles amazingly well, giving very convincing performances. <br/><br/>Overall, the whole movie should serve as a highly enjoyable and novel movie (although some people may find it slightly dull or hard to keep up with, and the main character a bit expressionless), with an extremely absorbing narrative structure and plot that'll keep your eyes glued to the screen, with a great twist at the end that should make it, all in all, a really worthwhile movie."

","We have a really original story here: Leonard, a man suffering from short-term memory loss is hunting for the man who raped and killed his wife. I guess I don't have to mention that his illness does not make his job easy, since once he starts a conversation, at about the fifth sentence he forgets how did it start, and only takes him a while 'til he forgets who is he talking with. Basically he can't remember anything since the day he got the wound on his face, but thanks to the notes and photographs he keeps creating all the time he manages to find the killer. Or at least that's what he thinks The directing is most definitely what makes this movie as unique as it is. The whole story is going backwards, so you just have to wait for the reasons, they will always come later. It reminded me a lot of French movie Irreversible, which had almost the same schema, but of course Memento is two years older, and to be honest I didn't like Irreversible since I found it a bit weird. On the other hand, the whole movie somehow magically reminded me of Fight Club, the thing between Leonard and Sammy was a bit like the ""connection"" between the Narrator and Tyler. Crazy, I must say.<br/><br/>Watching this film was a nice and interesting experience, and I would recommend it to anyone who is not scared of a little headache while trying to figure out what is going on.

It's normal if you don't get the point at first time watching it, but if you do, besides that you're smart, I would totally vote for the excellent achievement the director did.<br/><br/>This is a text book in film editing, and for those who wants to break ordinary time line, there is no better demonstration than this. Compared with Pulp Fiction or Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind which are both great movies of all time, the model that Memento established was more than its art of editing. Since this is a mystery movie, there won't be as much pleasure if we see the movie too clearly! Therefore, the complicated way of film editing really leveled up the unsolved problems which made the audiences wonder all the time until the end.<br/><br/>In fact, the process to reason the story is parallel to the missing part of each chapter which was played backwards, and with the disease the male leading role had, every flash moment before the missing parts make the audiences go through the same experiences as the male leading role did. The ambition is not satisfied with only one narrative method, so there appeared two different time lines in the movie which are separated by their colors. As the movie approached the end, two time lines came to an intersection, and the mystery was finally solved at that time. The most genius and impressive point is that at the forwards narrative time line, the leading actor mainly talked about the past story and that really confused the audiences about the real story that was going on! <br/><br/>Not only the form of the movie impressed me, but also the humanity that occurred after things he had gone through and the problem he had to deal with. How to live a life without knowing anything happened to you? Maybe the best way is to ignore the fact and create one for your own sake like the role did. Sometimes, it is more dangerous to know than to forget!"
"geniuskentyk-1","9","1","3","11 September 2010"," Christopher Nolan keeps up his wonderful track record!
","Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has a problem; he has anterograde amnesia, which means he can't produce new memories. The cause of this is from an accident, one which viewers will be able to find out about near the middle of the film. Leonard can remember everything before his accident, but anything after he can't remember; he can only go on for an uncertain amount of time until his brain restarts, making him lose memory of what just happened.<br/><br/>Leonard's problem allows director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception, The Prestige) to create something truly unique with the film by presenting it in a reverse-chronological order. 'Memento' is presented in two different ways throughout; the parts presented in color are played forward, but are ordered chronologically backwards; the parts presented in black-and-white are played forward, and are also ordered in chronologically forward. Some may get slightly confused by this style, but it shouldn't take long until the concept catches on and is understandable.<br/><br/>'Memento's' backwards-storytelling style is what keeps the film interesting. The viewer only knows as much as Leonard knows, at the beginning, but we gradually know more than him as the film comes to a close (though, we don't know that much more than him). When new scenes come up, they're usually funny and entertaining because it makes us wonder how Leonard got himself into that situation; of course, we find this out when the next scene comes up, which ends with the beginning of the previous scene.<br/><br/>The film's unique style forces viewers to constantly think, question, and assume about many different things within it, which is good. 'Memento' forces viewers to pay attention on what's happening on screen, as well as what those scenes could mean or be leading to.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Leonard has relationships with different characters, and we never know who is Leonard's ally or enemy, not what their motives are until the end. Leonard has a close friend, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who helps Leonard in his path to find and kill a specific person, but is Teddy really trying to help him or not? Leonard also develops a close relationship with a woman named Natalie (Carrie-Anne moss), whom is also trying to help Leonard find and kill a specific person, but who is Natalie? What's her motive, and is she truly helping him? Leonard believes someone's trying to make him kill the wrong person, but since we only know as much as he does, we never know if Teddy is that person, or if Natalie is that person, of if neither of them are the ones trying to lead Leonard in the wrong direction. This confusion and possibility keeps the film entertaining, and opinions regarding Teddy and Natalie will surely switch multiple times throughout the film.<br/><br/>When the film ends (which is technically the beginning), many things are explained. However, these explanations are open to interpretations; just because the film answered certain questions asked throughout, it doesn't mean those specific answers are the right answer. The ending of 'Memento' makes you think about possible scenarios that could have happened before the events of the film, and how those could be important to the film. 'Memento', by the end of the film, is pretty straightforward, but like Inception, the film is left open to interpretation.<br/><br/>Director-writer Christopher Nolan does an excellent job at setting up the film's premise and style. 'Memento' is actually adapted from the short story, 'Memento Mori', which was written by Nolan's younger brother, Jonathan Nolan. Christopher Nolan is always skilled in his psychological-thriller type films, and his skill is definitely not missing from 'Memento', which is one of his early films.<br/><br/>PS: 'Memento' might take some viewers mutiple viewings in order to like. Personally, I didn't like the film the first time I saw it. The second time around, however, I loved it! Some might like the film the first time, like some people I know."

"hakmer_thefake","8","1","3","16 December 2007"," Strange yet Captivating
","It's a movie bout a person who suffers from Short Term memory.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that made you think so hard just to understand the movie. An unpleasant movie as I watch it for the very first time. If you have a great ability to remember things you've seen and heard, you'd be able to understand it the very 1st time you watched it and then this will probably be just an average movie. But if you have a bad memory, though maybe not as bad as Leonard's(Pearce) memory, at first you'd find it hard to understand. So you'd probably watch it twice. The plot is backwards so it's confusing. You have to connect the start of his 15 minutes latest memory-which has passed 'bout 15 minutes- to the end of his 2nd latest 15 minutes, which is shown about 15 minutes after his latest memory. It's hard to put the pieces together. You'd probably watch it three times to enjoy it. At first it's unpleasant and it's not something you'd immediately like. But as you watch it for the 2nd or 3rd time, you find yourself enjoying thinking bout the movie, putting the fragments of his memory. And every fragment is great. Every 15 minutes of his memory has a feeling and also an objective. It help you dive into Leonard's memory (one that he can never remember). The final part, his last memory that we dive into is shocking. That he is never to remember any of the things he had done is good as it is bad for Leonard. In one hand, he will never be satisfied cause he will never remember even if he had succeed. In the other hand, it is the drive of vengeance that gave meaning to his life in his unusual life. This is a movie that - not only explained a disease but also - made us feel the feelings and of an ill character.<br/><br/>It's a great movie. The very 1st day I got it, I watched it 3 times.<br/><br/>Nolan is an unique director with unique films, he did a great job."

","Very rarely do we come across a film that is made for an intelligent audience. Memento is one of those films.The camera angles make the scenes very real and 'happening now' . The backdrop music and voice will grip the viewer into the movie.Don't watch the movie in breaks in case of home viewing .Pay attention as the movie goes and you will be spellbound. Well,however you watch it will leave you thinking about various things like your brain and time and more. The surprises and twists in the script make it a very deep and substantial story. <br/><br/>Guy Pearce(Leonard Shelby) has been made to act in such a way that every line he speaks tells you something about his character.The movie is very dramatic and very realistic at the same time.There will be a lot of times when you will be spellbound and speechless.Try figuring out the whole story at the end .Thats where the fun is. <br/><br/>cheers to more good movies<br/><br/>try also -The Prestige also by Cristopher Nolan"

","Which thing is, I think, what they were shooting for when they did this. This movie is great! The acting, the plot, the character development, the music, the photography, all very well done. But the best part is ... The convoluted continuity. Its like watching a plot fold out from the middle towards both ends. Whatever you do, don't blink. The players, all but one being unknown to me prior to this flick, do a fantastic job. This movie, and I'm not even sure of what genre it fits best having aspects of everything from crime drama to psychological thriller, is a credit to all involved. Kudos to the cast and crew, especially the director."
"Oceans17","10","1","3","20 June 2007"," Crippled mind/narrative in search of its own identity... Wow!
","***Warning: Major spoilers ahead***<br/><br/>An original idea cleverly executed!<br/><br/>I don't want to dwell in the analysis of facts and coherence: the last images of ""Memento"" (or where they the first ones?) leave few possible, coherent or logical explanations, as we see Lenny's tattoos when his wife is still alive: was the character of Jorja Fox his second wife, and then whatever became of her? Did he kill her? Or perhaps his only wife survived the attack and Lenny's tattooed himself to create a puzzle and distract himself from the tragedy of memory loss...<br/><br/>Too complicated. Lenny's amnesia could be simulated, and in fact sometimes he seems to forget to play the amnesic (what an irony!). This would explain a lot. But, like in ""The Prestige"", do we really need an explanation? What if the illusion is more interesting? In fact, Nolan has set us up with false memories and a puzzle where the search for coherence is the McGuffin that drives another search: that of meaning for our lives, identity for ourselves, and all those little daily routines or sentimental rituals that define us. What makes you who you are? Your car? Your dress? Your money? Your home? Your hotel? Your job? Your restaurant? Your disease? Your actions? Your friends? Your lovers? Your family? Your lies? Your crimes? Your death? Your memory?<br/><br/>The presence of two ""Matrix"" actors (Moss and Pantoliano, the girl and the villain) is an interesting coincidence. Both films are about invented or fictitious lives: one created from inside the person, and the other crafted from outside the individual.<br/><br/>After ""Memento"", I'm interested in everything Nolan has done or will do in the future: even if he films a three hour prequel to ""My stepmother is an alien"", I will watch it with enthusiasm: I know that he will turn it into something interesting. He already did that in ""Batman Begins"".<br/><br/>Unforgettable memento of the unlimited possibilities of cinema.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 for Christopher Nolan, and also for John Nolan (author of the narration that inspired the film)."
"Torgo_Approves","10","1","3","20 April 2007"," Now... where was I?
","You've probably noticed that I haven't said a thing about the actual plot of the film yet. That's because the less you know about it, the more fun - and frustrating - the film will be to watch. I highly recommend this, it's one of the best of 2000 and simply too original to miss.<br/><br/>Since we are never quite sure what just happened, we not only understand what Leonard's going through, we literally go through the exact same thing. The motivations and intentions of the characters Leonard meets are never quite clear to us and we're never sure if anyone really means what he or she says. This and the power of the final scene (which, had it been the first scene, would have reduced the film's impact enormously) is what makes the plot structure more than a gimmick - it's essential to the power of the story to tell it in this order.<br/><br/>Speaking of fantastic acting - with this and his vital supporting role in ""L.A. Confidential"" under his belt, the real mystery is why Guy Pearce isn't one of the biggest stars in Hollywood today. I honestly couldn't see anyone else playing Leonard Shelby. He might come off a bit wooden at first, but it's really just the way his character is written - he believably portrays paranoia and confusion later (or should that be earlier?) on in the film. Carrie-Ann Moss is wonderfully convincing and cold and Joe Pantoliano is just one of those actors who can't seem to screw up a single line on dialogue. I wouldn't want to change a single casting choice.<br/><br/>Change the scenes to run in chronological order and there's still Nolan's witty script, fantastic acting and characterization, and slick visuals to enjoy, but the film's true power is really in its structure.<br/><br/>It's also a movie which needs several viewings to be completely understood, but its plot is far from incomprehensible - as soon as you understand the system by which the scenes have been arranged, you just need to put the pieces together. The answers are all there for those who look for them. The use of black-and-white photography for some scenes is very helpful and a nice touch.<br/><br/>The new millennium has just started and, as if from out of nowhere, comes English director Christopher Nolan with his confusing, frustrating, groundbreaking, atmospheric and 100% original masterpiece, Memento. It's a film that will quickly grow a huge cult following for its ingenious plot structure and editing, and deservedly so. It's a unique and fresh concept used to create a movie which excels in every area and stands out as a fantastic movie by thriller standards, no matter in what order the scenes appear.<br/><br/>There are no spoilers in this review. I promise."
"Psalm52","Null","1","3","1 April 2007"," Short-term memory loss can be a
","A lot of IMDb reviewers hate this film and a lot more love it. I'm in the objective middle. It's a well written screenplay w/ wonderful performances. The story is straight-forward: the Leonard character killed his wife by injecting her repeatedly w/ Insulin. There never was an intruder who killed her. He does not suffer from short-term memory loss and is acting. When he kills the Teddy character he is bringing closure to his murderous spree (Dodd, Jimmy Grant). This is a solid film and worth watching much like ""The Crying Game"" in its story structure. Kudos to Nolan and the actors  even if Carrie Anne is annoying!"
"sedwards79","10","1","3","9 March 2007"," Mind-F*ck
","This movie has affected me in a way no other movie ever has. After watching this for the first time, I woke up in the middle of the night so paranoid, I starting choking my girlfriend. We've have since broken up (suprising), but we can still laugh about the time we shared a moment of true terror. She has since forgiven me, but I've never been so scared in all my life as I was that night. Do you need a better recommendation that that? I have watched this movie again since then, and it still resonates as a truly disturbing and emotional experience. I would have to say, in my opinion, Memento is one of the greatest films ever made."
"ryuakamrvengeance","10","1","3","7 March 2007"," Filmaking at its most innovative
","Films are so often fed to us with a large spoon. Producers don't give the public much credit, and watching some films they must think we are retarded. So it's nice to see someone giving us a cinematic challenge. Thank you Christopher Nolan for this unique piece of film making and not considering us as intellectually redundant. The film is by my standards (which are pretty cynical I'm told) a modern masterpiece. Everything about this film is delivered in great detail, from the colour schemes to the cinematography. Nolan gets the structure spot on, if he twists it too much, it becomes wrapped up in so many layers it becomes uninjectable, too little and it becomes pointless and weak. The characters are brilliantly written, even if the dialogue at times is a little pretentious. Pearce and Pantoliano are both excellent and Carie Ann Moss is annoying, which is a shame, but excusable. I would advise anyone who wants to see a truly compelling, unpredictable, thought provoking film to see this, because it is worthy of the top 10 films ever made. And plus, it is far better then The Godfather:Part 2."
"StayPuft003","10","1","3","6 March 2007"," The Most Cleverly constructed film... ever
","Memento is the most cleverly constructed movie ever to be put on the big screen. While this is clearly what makes it such an important movie, nearly every other aspect of the film makes it one of the best films I have ever seen. The acting, especially from Guy Pierce, is phenomenal. You feel for the characters even when you don't know much about them, mainly because they don't know much about themselves. From the opening sequence, the movie hooks you in and never lets go. The story moves along quickly, and keeps you guessing from beginning to end. There is suspense, drama, violence, and even some comedy. But the thing that holds this film together is Christopher Nolan's precise direction, which keeps the viewer intrigued but unable to look away. All in all, this is a must see Crime Drama/Thriller/Mystery that will be a life changing experience for most moviegoers."
"thebronzedragon","10","1","3","28 February 2007"," Re-edited For My Own Amusement
","I took a VHS of this film into my editing room and re-edited it backwards, so that it was frontwards, if you get my drift, and watched it a second time, trying to pretend I was seeing it for the first time. It was still visually arresting and the dialog was still sharp and engaging...but it just wasn't the same film and the ending was sort of anticlimactic because you see it coming a mile away. In fact the film becomes frustrating because his memory loss gets very redundant and tiresome very early on.<br/><br/>I am convinced this movie was edited backward because that was the only way this story could be told. It forces the reader to experience what the main character is experiencing, because we don't know any more than he does from one scene to the next. What made my re-edited version so frustrating was that we knew too much and his amnesia came off as just a device to prolong the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, good experiment. Enjoyed the film immensely the way it was intended to be viewed."
"mjw2305","10","1","3","23 January 2007"," Wow, don't miss this one folks

","Memento is an estranged trip through the experiences of a man incapable of retaining short term memories, & desperate to attain justice in the form of murder, though dependent on the honesty of those around him, & his own personal systematic chronicling of people, places & events, though photos, journal entries, tattoos & data collecting.<br/><br/>The film's distinctive format is masterful, & moves in the only way possible, such that the audience will identify with the main character, who's disjointed perception of reality would make it impossible otherwise. Each scene, with the exception of the chronologically running black & white flashbacks, is followed by a scene containing preceding events, that essentially force the viewer to witness the course of events backwards. This technique keeps the audience as clueless to the truth of the elusively mysterious events, as the main character, Leonard Shelby, himself, thus giving the viewer a common bond with him.<br/><br/>There is not one thing about this film I did not find excellent, to the point of perfection. The direction is meticulous, the acting is exemplary, the story is powerful, & the dialog is captivating. Not being a film maker, myself, the editing of this piece left me in awe, as to how someone could retain this vision in their mind throughout the production. It is obvious that the exercise of memory is something which the director, Chris Nolan (Batman Returns, Insomnia) has mastered.<br/><br/>The performance from Guy Pearce, which I believe to be his best, manages to be paranoid, vulnerable, frigidly logical, uncomfortably emotional at times, & explosively dangerous, all at once, while he deals with the conspicuous characters around him. Joe Pantoliano successfully exudes sarcasm, empathy, humor, & untrustworthiness, as Lenny's bizarrely ongoing acquaintance, & Carrie-Ann Moss turns in a well fit performance as a woman involved in this disturbing scenario, with motives of her own, & who is searching for answers herself, in this entangled affair. <br/><br/>The ending of this film is predictable in one way, as was intended, but wholly unpredictable in others, as the mystery unravels, & leaves the viewer questioning everything & everyone that they have been watching. This film is not for everyone, as it requires a great deal of concentration, abstract thinking, & possibly repeated viewings, to grasp every detail. I've seen it countless times, & even went to the extreme of watching the scenes in reverse order on my DVD player, in order to have even another take on the events. <br/><br/>Each time I watch it, it has been rewarding.

","*** This comment doesn't directly contain a spoiler, but it does reference a website (http://www.memorylossonline.com/spring2002/memlossatmovies.htm) that would spoil the movie for anyone that hasn't yet seen it ***<br/><br/>The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was one of the most intriguing films I'd ever seen. However, I didn't think it would hold up to repeated viewing because much of the plot complexity is achieved by careful editing, which surely couldn't work second time around. Also, I thought I had the plot mostly figured out and didn't think I'd gain that much from another viewing (especially since the soundtrack and visuals are nothing special). <br/><br/>Note on the editing: the story is not simply told ""backwards"" as some people would have you believe (each scene's time-line goes in the right direction!) but the scenes are placed (mostly) in reverse order. The narrative in Pulp Fiction also benefits from the order in which certain events are told and I still don't find that device having any adverse effect on my enjoyment of that movie. Also, I think that some people fail to realize that the main character is trying to make sense of his recent past and we are seeing events unfurl as he tries to piece together his ""evidence"" and use his powers of logic to uncover the truth (while other characters try to deceive him).<br/><br/>I'm glad to say that I was mostly wrong about having the plot figured out first time around, because I'm just as confused this time - I got to the end of the film and came to a different conclusion. I suppose this is one of the strongest features of this movie - there is no certainty. The ""facts"" need to be treated with suspicion and their worthiness needs to be judged. You have to interpret each scene (presented to you not from the main character's memory of course, but instead the result of his applied logic and reasoning). Even then, you can put any spin on it you like. I assumed that I wouldn't be as engaged with the movie as I was the first time, but instead I found that I was analyzing the clues in a different way. The first time I watched it, I expected a big reveal, as in the ""Usual Suspects"" and until now I thought I'd got it.<br/><br/>I have just finished watching this movie for the second time and found myself drawing different conclusions from it. In fact, I'm left thinking that I could watch this movie a third time, prejudiced by my second viewing, and still come up with a different interpretation.<br/><br/>There are many people who have commented on this film stating that it is full of plot holes. Few of these people care to explain what these plot holes are. Some do, and most of those people take issue with the main character's memory loss in that he remembers certain things, but not others. <br/><br/>http://www.memorylossonline.com/spring2002/memlossatmovies.htm Is worth taking a look at if you have already seen the movie and wish to read an informed critique on the way that ""short-term"" memory loss is handled in the movie. <br/><br/>To quote from this source: ""Leonard Shelby suffers from profound anterograde amnesia, which is depicted accurately in the film"". The article goes on to infer that Shelby suffers from psychogenic memory loss in addition to anterograde amnesia. This would explain why apparently Shelby doesn't want to accept the truth when he discovers it.<br/><br/>Usually, when I suspect the integrity of the premise upon which a work of fiction (or supposed fact) is based, I find that my suspicions are justified. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the research done for the book (upon which Memento's screenplay is based) is accurate and forms a powerful device to enrich the plot and engage the viewer, even for two (or perhaps more) viewings. Still, you can't beat the confusion you feel as you're watching it the first time."

","An amazing movie. If you haven't seen it yet definitely go out and buy, not rent, buy it because I can guaranty that you're going to want to watch it over and over again. The movie is about a man, Leonard Shelby, with CRS decease (CRS mean can't remember S@#&). It is based off a short story called Memento Mori. <br/><br/>I say that this movie is brilliant because of the way it is edited, in a backwards, forwards, double strain helix. If you don't have a clue what I mean watch the movie. The first strain, played in color, runs backward whereas the next strain, in black and white, runs forwards. This is disorienting at first but the audience gets used to it. <br/><br/>The idea is to put the viewer in Leonard's shoes. Leonard is constantly disoriented because he can't even remember who he was just talking to or what about. You almost become the character. <br/><br/>Brilliant movie and a brilliant director who could ask for more?"

"nablaquadro","10","1","3","17 December 2006"," My favorite movie - ever !!
","I saw Memento at the premiere at Venice Film Festival in 2000. I always liked independent films because the low budget and the will-to-do typical of young cinematographers is often bewildering. In Memento these peculiarities catch the spectators towards a mind-blowing labyrinth, fitter to a puzzle-master than common people. The editing is (I suppose) unique in cinema history and fortunately very little directors tried to double this trick for their movies; nevertheless, on the other hand, the stratagem of short-term memory was abused in 2000s' cinema and that's a pity.<br/><br/>Carrie-Ann Moss is a gem. Her character Natalie is a mine of perfidy; her solely eyes sting as needles and show how failing can be a friendship (Teddy and the porter too !!), taking easily advantage from a weak person. How many times, in real life, did we feel like Lenny, even without his ""incident"" ?<br/><br/>You need at least two or three re-runs to understand it, nobody can do it with less, but that's not an handicap, it's such a motivation to sketch out a conversation between supporters/detractors and ""what really happened"".

In fact I would almost advise you to watch it by yourself or with a very die-hard movie fan friend. Just a little conversation with your friend or girlfriend can totally derail you from the path of the movie...it's already hard enough to totally understand in 1 round...I needed 2 to get everything straight.<br/><br/>The 3 main actors(Pearce,Moss,Pantoliano) give,not stellar,but great performances nonetheless...the movie plot surely gives kudos to their performances...<br/><br/>I found Pearce to be the best of the three...his confused voice,his empty from opinion face and,of course,his blocknote-body make Leonard come to life...<br/><br/>Moss,was good also,she has in her face the mystery the role needs...the good girl that is not totally what she seems to be... <br/><br/>Remarkable is the scene where she shouts and curses Leonard,by stating him that she can tell him whatever she likes,since he will not remember anything soon enough,transforming him into a mere puppet...my personal favorite one<br/><br/>Pantoliano,at last,gives the movie what it lacks:the funny element,without becoming a clown,but by showing us at least a smile in the mysterious world of Leonard...<br/><br/>Opponents like The Usual Suspects or Silence of the Lambs are,not easily,but slightly beaten in my opinion...They are great movies too,but to me they lack the so perfect identification Memento offers us...<br/><br/>Nolan has proved to be a genius director and screenwriter,as he continuously show's us in his new movies-he is today my favorite director.He hasn't directed many movies,but those 6 or 7 ones he gave us, are all brilliant and thought provoking...<br/><br/>To Sum Up,Memento is truly Nolan's Masterpiece and a jewel in the Thriller Museum. In the years that will come,from the many,great or not, thrillers that will appear,some will try to reach or steal it's greatness,but to me Memento will always be the highest apple of the tree.<br/><br/>I Will Never Remember a Better Thriller..."

","Memento brilliantly puts you into Pierce' s head and makes you truly fell like you have short term memory loss. His perspective of the world is one of isolation. Everything he can remember is either written down or tattooed on himself. Imagine Not knowing if you did something or not. After the movie finishes, you feel like you forgot to do something.<br/><br/>The Movie begins with Guy Pierce desperately seeking who killed his wife. It is the one thing he lives for. He suffers from short term memory loss and his memory, like the movie, is shown in fragments that resemble what he can actually remember. The search continues throughout the movie and ends in one of the bests twists ever."

","Where do I begin? They should make a genre of movies for ones like this and just call them ""Wow Movies."" That is the reaction I had after watching this one. First of all, if you have a short attention span or don't like to pay very close attention to movies, do not watch this one. It is a film for the thinking person, one which requires your full attention. The plot (and the way it is portrayed) is one of a kind. Memento starts at the end, and progressively works toward the beginning. Confused? The movie is backwards (Wondering what I mean by that? See for yourself!). Guy Pearce gives a striking performance, one that will leave you wondering ""How did this guy not win the Best Actor Academy Award?!"" Pearce's character, Leonard Shelby, suffers from a short-term memory loss disease. To remember things, he must tattoo notes all over his body, and take photographs of every last person and thing he encounters. Pearce's performance will make any viewer believe this guy really can't remember a damn thing. He is that good. The movie is full of twists, turns, surprises, you name it. If you think a character is good, chances are they are bad. And if you think someone is really trying to help Leonard, well let's just say they might not be as sympathetic as you seem. This film will undoubtedly leave you with numerous questions, some which may even be about your very own life and the motives of all the people in your life. Now, what were we talking about?

"ikensey","6","1","3","8 January 2006"," Interesting ideas let down by huge plot holes
","Memento has definite style. the plot goes forwards and backwards at the same time. The ""forward narrative"" is distinguished by the director by being shown in black and white. At the beginning I was really interested with the story, the theme of revenge and the strange narrative. But after a while it became clear that I had hoped for too much. Not as many plot twists as I hoped, and many common sense errors in the plot. Example: in Lennie's phone conversation, if he can't remember things that happened a few minutes ago, why doesn't lose his memory at any point in the call? The ending, though a surprising and definitely unexpected twist, also didn't seem very clear. If Lennie's wife wasn't killed, why would he remember it that way? But much more damning is this: how could he remember his story as Sammy's, if since the accident he couldn't make new memories? However, if you can ignore these plot holes, you should like this stylish film."

I've been a fan of Guy Pearce since his Australian TV days, on into ""Priscilla"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" and this allows him even more range.<br/><br/>For us to experience time the way he does, the story unravels through backwards scenes; the technique is indicated from the opening shot where a graphic Polaroid photo fades while being shook, instead of the expected getting brighter and clearer -- a visual metaphor for the protagonist as well. After that, the story isn't on literal rewind; instead we see the scenes in reverse order of how they happened; onion-like we see how the character ended up getting to the scene just before. If Humphrey Bogart's character thought ""The Big Sleep"" tough to figure out, this one is even more convoluted.<br/><br/>Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano are terrific, and not relying on some of their tics from other movies and TV shows, as the folks who may or may not be lying to or manipulating the protagonist.<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure how all the pieces fit together and went to see it again a week later -- and came away with different interpretations. And I got a third interpretation from reading the original short story by the director's brother that was in the April 2001 issue of ""Esquire.""

He is on a death hunt but he has no memory of the murderer or any details by which he could get to him. He tattoes himself with mementos of his daily life. Imagine that!!

","Memento is one of a kind. There is no other movie like it, so it can not be compared to other movies. All I can say is that for what it is, it is absolutely flawless in every aspect. The most well- known concept of Memento is the specialty of the movie being played backwards. The story immediately revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) who is a victim of a type of brain damage called short term memory or ""he cannot make new memories"". His last memory is that of his wife being raped and killed, and he has devoted his life to finding this killer through clues he leaves himself before he forgets. There is not much to say about this movie without ruining the unpredictable summary (beginning). All that I can say is, that it is a Must-See and that it is one of a kind.<br/><br/>I highly Recommend this movie."

The whole concept of reversing the plot structure is brilliant. One would think this creates a lack of tension but that is not the case.

"Benjamin_Cox","10","1","3","16 June 2005"," Complex, intriguing, amazing - an essential film to watch - 92%
","Like many fans of the ""Batman"" movies, I had doubts about the new film ""Batman Begins"". Christopher Nolan is a director with an impressive but very short CV and I confess, I had doubts. So I figured a little research was needed before I cough up the cash to go to the cinema and what better than his critically acclaimed smash ""Memento""? I was a little concerned about not being able to follow the famously non-linear plot but all concerns evaporated quickly as I was soon absorbed in this original and intriguing thriller.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce plays Leonard, the victim of a vicious assault where he was attacked and his wife was raped and murdered. As a result, Leonard has no short-term memory - he remembers everything before the attack but he is incapable of forming new memories, meaning he has to write down every important detail or tattoo it onto his body. Determined to find his wife's killer, Leonard soon finds himself assisted by waitress Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and garrulous individual Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). But can he conquer his condition to bring the killer to justice? <br/><br/>""Memento"" is a very strange movie, filmed backwards but interspersed with the present, filmed in black and white. As a consequence, you quickly discover who the killer is and the clues reveal themselves instead of being formed. They just pop up in Leonard's pocket - a photo of a person or a new tattoo on his chest - but the film follows the reasons behind the clues rather than what the clues lead to. Once you've got your head around this unusual complication, ""Memento"" is a simply stunning film and a remarkable achievement. In terms of writing, editing, directing and acting, this is one of the best films that I have seen for many years. It is utterly captivating, drawing you into it's myriad story lines from the first frame. I can think of few other films with a better opening and due to its nature, it refuses to let go of your attention. Things like toilet breaks and food don't matter all of a sudden! <br/><br/>Guy Pearce has done a fantastic job of bringing Leonard to life, surely the role of a lifetime and proves that ""LA Confidential"" was no fluke. Pantoliano is typically brilliant but Moss is a real surprise, providing depth and mystery to a character that would just be another love interest role in the hands of a lesser story-teller. Almost enough to banish memories of a certain cat-suit! The only thing I could criticise is the number of plot-holes but seeing as that universal plot-discrepancy device (a dodgy memory) is used, you could say that this isn't really a great point. The other thing is deciding how far back do you go - I still had questions at the end of the film but then again, so would Leonard. ""Memento"" demands your concentration and admiration in equal measures. It is a wonderfully complex and interesting thriller and offers some hope that Mr Nolan can resurrect the Dark Knight once again like Tim Burton did before him."
"iamassachusetts","7","1","3","8 June 2005"," Memento is a poor man's Fight Club!
","Like several of its ""neo-contemporaries"" such as 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Others' - Memento is told to us in reverse order. Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, kills the murderer of his wife in the film's first scene, and the film then moves backward from that point, in roughly five-minute increments, to let us see how he tracked the guy down, ending with what is, chronologically, the story's beginning. Made with a budget of under $5 million the movie's structure has been oversimplified. Though there is immense thought behind the story, both technically and thematically, one can't help notice that this movie often lacks cutting edge sound, direction or photography to take it to a higher level. <br/><br/>This movie has quickly found a hyped cult status among some people. They're entitled to their opinion, but many of the negative reviews make it plain to see that this movie didn't quite grasp what director/writer Nolan wanted to portray. Still, given the way the film business works, critics usually have only one chance to see the film and have to dash out a review before deadline, so even many of the downbeat reviews should not discourage viewers from seeing Memento for themselves. <br/><br/>Overall this move is good, but is way too overrated at number 22 all time in the IMDb top 250. This movie can't light a candle to similar structured movies like Fight Club. <br/><br/>Can we get some more votes for Fight Club!"

","One of the absolute top movies ever.<br/><br/>Unique in the way that the director really lets you in on how the main character feels, how he sees the world and how one gets to think exactly like him. No other movie is even close to do this as good as Memento. It's such a simple idea, that you can't help but wondering how no-one hasn't thought of it before. The whole feeling of ""Why? What's happening? Who am I?"" really gets to you and leaves you with a slight feeling of helplessness and apathy after the last scene. The performance of the actors may not be the best ever, but they're definitely not bad -It's, as said above, more the idea that makes this movie special."
"rosaishere","10","1","3","20 May 2005"," Utterly insane story + fragmented time line = one of the most amazing thrillers ever
","Without a doubt I have never watched a film that has engaged me more than Memento. The story is utterly insane, the time line is all over the place  yet it proves to be one of the most effective and entertaining thrillers available to date. <br/><br/>The film starts off with a bizarre shooting of an unknown individual being shown in reverse. As soon as the credits finish the film starts off from the ending. We soon learn that the shooter Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffered a large blow to the head on the same night his wife was raped and murdered. Everything leading up to the murder he can remember, but anything afterwards he can't remember. This is a superb spin on the clichéd amnesia thrillers, where in this case, the hero cannot form new memories as opposed to not being able to recollect old ones. Leonard is out to solve his wives' murder, but in doing so he must use a series of tattoos and photos to collect evidence and solve the mystery. Along the way he appears to be manipulated by a cop who seems to have a strange interest in him (Joe Pantoliano) and a mysterious bartender who seems to know more than she's leading on (Carrie-Anne Moss). But the real challenge is in judging, who is genuine and who is false?<br/><br/>The inspiring thing about this film, is that it's told in reverse; the events are told roughly in five minute intervals playing back from the end and working towards the beginning. By the time the film finishes you will be questioning yourself as to the truth about Lenny. This is one of the most original characteristics about this film; it is all open to personal interpretation. You seem to find yourself pausing the film every few minutes just to try and comprehend exactly what is happening. Definitely a web of mystery worth solving.<br/><br/>When you finally reach the end of this masterpiece, and the ending has been revealed you will be very satisfied. The only thing I can recommend afterwards is purchase the DVD! Behold there is an option to watch the film in the correct order, much less taxing on the brain. Yet this film will always remain an utter classic!"
"Bismarck33431","9","1","3","13 May 2005"," Memento
","Memento is the story of a man battling an injury that affects his memory as he tries to uncover the identity of a man who assaulted and helped kill his wife. Memento is puzzling as it develops, rather than after its conclusion, as with some others. We are given enough evidence to speculate in a few directions as to what truly has occurred, but only over limited circumstances and time. Every facet of everyday reality is called into question, as the main character, Leonard, played by Guy Pierce, has a form of brain damage that limits his ability to create new memories. Leonard, a former claims investigator, relies on his investigative ""instinct,"" supposedly controlled by another center of the brain, to tell friend from foe. As we see, this ability is not perfect. The film centers on who among Leonard?s contacts are to be trusted and who aren't, what their motivations are, and what Leonard?s are.<br/><br/>The story is told in reverse, in color, and forward, in black and white. In color, we watch Leonard compile his evidence in segments representing segments of his memory, with attention paid to the clues he collects and the contacts he makes, while in black and white we see Leonard relating his story on the phone to someone he believes is a police officer. Leonard believes his truth-sensing ability is contingent in large part upon judging a person's expressions and movement, and as such doesn't normally trust anyone he can't stare down. Presumably, however, Leonard answers the telephone shortly after his memory has reset, and is more likely to be fooled into revealing his thoughts on his situation before he can collect his notes and review his tattoos. Thus, a large part of the ""facts"" we are given on Leonard and his story are told through the forward-filmed segments where Leonard believes he is speaking to a police officer in confidence. Leonard eventually uncovers a tattoo warning him not to speak via phone, whereupon he breaks off this communication.<br/><br/>The established story gets weaker and weaker as the film continues. Leonard's story of the police refusing to investigate the case, wanting for some reason want to deny that Leonard was hit by the second of assailants who attacked his wife, begins to make less sense as details are revealed. Leonard?s condition is exceedingly rare, but both he and Sammy Jankis somehow develop it. Several similar discrepancies lead the viewer to question most of the facts by the film's conclusion. Ultimately, we are left to guess at Leonard's motives, as well as his history. When Leonard dooms Teddy to eventual death by manipulating his own memories ('""don't believe his lies""), we are left to guess whether he does so out of a pathological desire to kill or because he sees Teddy as a crooked cop (who may not even be a cop) who has been manipulating Leonard's memory disorder for his own ends, killing and robbing drug dealers, in particular. When Leonard kills Jimmy, who he thought was ""John G."" at the time, only to find that Teddy had set the situation up to cash in on the drug money, it's possible that Leonard considered turnabout fair play, repaying Teddy's betrayal with one of his own. However, Teddy seems to believe he had an agreement with Leonard to split the drug money after the killing, a likely excuse, but possibly true, which would considerably alter our view of Leonard's motives.<br/><br/>The director, Nolan, lets the viewer draw their own conclusions. The evidence that Leonard is, in his mind, a righteous killer, I believe is in his own clues. Throughout the film, we see Leonard compile and tattoo clues on his body designed to help him find ""John G."" While the ending confirms that Leonard is serious about the investigation, we are left with the possibility that he, too, is using himself as an assassin of sorts, eliminating his enemies with a clean conscience by setting them up as ""John G."" Of course, this is speculation, but not implausible. While the clues Leonard leaves for himself are numerous and all directed toward ""John G.,"" Leonard can change his goals on a whim based on any assumption, and his goals could be far from static in purpose. While it isn't clear, Leonard may have simply suspected Teddy, with Natalie planting the bait on him and/or Jimmy that lead to their deaths; however, it's also possible that Leonard has been through several ""John G.'s,"" and needs the hunt to give purpose to his life. These are a few of many possible interpretations. In the end, the director chooses to leave many variables undefined, adding to the effectiveness of the film, even if at the cost of some confusion."
"mlgirard","9","1","3","12 May 2005"," Actions speak louder than memories
","While ""Memento"" is a difficult to follow film, it's not excruciatingly difficult. I'm not certain I agree with Teddy's version of the ending (or beginning as it were), but I'm not certain I can disagree with it either. The sequence of events and the way in which they are presented to the audience as well as the reason for this manner of presentation require the viewer to question everything. Not only do we begin to question the events of the movie but we begin to question the events in our own lives and the way in which we recall them. Is it our memories which make us what we are or is it our actions? <br/><br/>""Memento"" is presented as what I find to be the ultimate form of a mystery; however it's a flip version of our usual concept of a mystery. Most mysteries are said to be written by beginning at the end and finishing with the mysterious beginning. These mysteries are then presented to us beginning with the mystery and ending with the resolution. This film on the other hand, seems to have been written from the beginning (if we take Teddy's revelations at the end of the film to be true) where this sequence of tracking down John G. begins and Leonard's reasons for it. Leonard sets himself up to murder who is supposedly the wrong man knowing that he will forget his own setup. But, when we watch the movie this is the ending. We begin watching ""Memento"" from the resolution of the conflict when Leonard decides that Teddy is the John G. who raped and killed his wife and enacts his vengeance upon him. <br/><br/>Whenever a film is presented in a backwards form it's not only difficult to follow but difficult to put together and edit properly in the first place. The director used scenes moving backwards but the beginnings and endings of each scene overlapped just enough with the following scene. This method I think is what held the film together so well. It allows the viewer to question what happened just before the current scene while allowing them to see how it connects with the previous scene.<br/><br/>Teddy at one point brings up the possibility of Leonard's pictures and notes being false and that he has no way to verify them. Leonard replies by saying that ""Memories are an interpretation, not records."" Are our memories any better than photos? Aren't they just as difficult to verify? The difference between a Polaroid and our own memory is that a Polaroid is more easily shared with another, though we may not share their interpretation of it. Memories also have a kind of emotional attachment to them. Certain memories we block out because we have negative associations regarding them whereas many other memories come to our mind quickly because they fit into our belief system more readily.<br/><br/>I think that Leonard's photographs and notes represent our memories in possibly a more manageable form. He does indeed have an emotion attachment to many of them. So attached that he tattoos many of them onto his own skin. He takes photos of those things he deems important. These are the memories he wants to be able to recall. But what of all of the things he sees which he has opportunities to take snap shots of but doesn't? He also alters his memories by crossing out notes on certain photographs and burning others. When he decides that he wants to kill Teddy in the future he sets himself up by writing on Teddy's photograph ""don't believe his lies"". He's purposely altering the photo to associate it with something negative and to lead him to believe Teddy was his wife's rapist. <br/><br/>Others also have the ability to alter his memory to their advantage. Natalie seems like a sympathetic person who's trying to help Leonard but we later find out that she has played with his memory to make him believe she needed help. Teddy also manipulates Leonard's memory many times, most obviously by using him as a tool to kill undesirables who could pass as Leonard's ""John G."" Others can alter our memories by displaying to us that which is false, or by manipulating memories we already have but may be vague.<br/><br/>A number of times in the film Leonard speaks of action. Is it our memories that make us who we are or is it the actions we perform? Leonard doesn't seem to be a different person throughout the movie. He has the same memories throughout it. His mind always starts off at the same place. But, do his actions in his different points of awareness make him a different person in each? One might argue that since he's acting from the same belief system that he is the same person. I tend to agree with this. Over and over again he's given the chance of killing his wife's rapist. Over and over again he chooses to do so. While he's blocked out the memories of his actions, they all seem to be based on the same set of beliefs. It's like with the case of Sammy Jenkis (or Leonard as we later find out). Every time he gave his wife her insulin shot he did so out of love. He didn't remember that he had done this already and thus she allowed him to kill her, but he was simply acting upon those beliefs which he thought was right.<br/><br/>""Memento"" is a true puzzle. I say this because it's not just an incoherent mix of various scenes and various people. Everything is interconnected and it's up to the viewer to piece the puzzle together. This may imply something about our minds as well. We have this collection of scenes and people in our memories and its up to us to decide how we wish to put them into place."
"jacktle","9","1","3","12 May 2005"," if we can't trust our own memory, what can we trust? - ""SPOILER""
","Christopher Nolan is relatively new to directing, but created a smash hit with Memento. This film is puzzling to audiences all over the world, and no one can really grasp all of its detail without a second viewing. Memento explores a variety of themes such as self-deception, existentialism, truth and the capacities of our memory. In route of exploring these themes, Nolan is able to play with the very structure of the film and what the audience has come to understand. The main highlight that separates this film from many others is the use of time. This reverse order that is shown to the audience works to put the viewer in the shoes of the main character, Leonard. They live and see what he sees. Viewers only know the events that have just unfolded on the scene and do not know what led to it. This is an elaborate gimmick that significantly gets the audience worked up and makes them question more about what they saw and what does it mean. For instance, only seeing a main get shot in the head will make viewers wonder what lead to that ultimate crime. On the other hand, seeing a man with a gun pointed to his head, they can conclude that he will get shot in the head and so the viewer is already speculating what will happen. This same trail of thought can be observed elsewhere in society. When we meet new people, we see them in the current state of time. We do not know their past, but often wonder what led to the creation of this person that we come into contact with. Where did he/she come from? What has he/she done until this time? Even after getting to know a person, how are we to be certain that what they say is the truth? So the viewer, the reverse chronological order can be seen as normal. It's just the same process they go through in ordinary life, only highlighted in this film. Of the many themes, existentialist ideas can be found throughout the film. The striving idea behind existentialism is that existence precedes and rules essence and that humans have free will and are the ultimate judge. It also states that since we are the bear sole responsibility for our decisions and actions, we must also face the consequences. Leonard's decision to deceive himself can be understood similarly. He choose to give his life meaning, by sending himself on a wild goose chase leading towards this Teddy character. He is fully aware of what he's doing, and only in that moment, because he will have forgotten all about it later. We are never certain as to who Teddy was or even what he was doing with Leonard, but we see that Leonard is exercising his freedom and will face the situation of murder. After forgetting that he had deceived himself, he kills Teddy, and now he's faced the ramification of deceiving himself only ten minutes ago. Another scene that alludes to existentialist ideas is during the narration, Leonard makes the remark that, ""The world does not disappear once we close our eyes."" This follows the notion that with our death or unconsciousness, life does not come to a stop. Human existence continues to be. It follows the idea that there is no higher being and that we exist purely for that reason and that we make of it what we do and decide, and so after you close your eyes, life continues on with whatever decisions or actions you've made. If Leonard closes his eyes, it would not change the fact that he killed Teddy and that fact will still be there after he opens his eyes. It can also be said that we live a very fragmented life. Our society today has evolved into short snippets of sounds and visuals seen on television and the radio. We can never have a complete certainty over any of what we encounter each day. The truth remains hidden by the media. When we watch television, it's only a representation of what really happened, such as images of a crash, we don't know when, how, or why it happened. But we take it without question, the details that are given to us on the screen by the anchorman. We can only have truth in what we experience directly. In the case of Memento, we can only be certain of the live events that take place in color. Its fragmented order reflects how our lives too are in pieces. Only once we placed everything in the order we want will we get a message. It's possible to get more than just one message with different placements of order. For Memento, it's not just any order, it's specifically reverse chronological order. And so we get one concrete idea or theme. Other films such as Pulp Fiction have fragmented order, but not chronological or reverse chronological order. And so they would have a more open-ended theme that will bend and flex with the viewer that perceives it. The film also questions the reliability of our memories. It has been a well known fact that the human memory can be inaccurate and very subjective. Eyewitness accounts usually aren't enough in the court systems and can obscure the truth. Our memories can drastically alter the truth as implied by Leonard, ""Memory can change the shape of a room. It can change the color of your car."" In the case of this film, the viewer must decide whether or not Leonard's memories can be trusted, since he is the one with a long-term memory dysfunction. Nolan's fresh style has won over most of the viewers of Memento. Its unique approach to time is, without a doubt, innovative. The plot is kept relatively simple which helps focus on the main idea of timing."

","Memento is a movie that would be difficult to make because the whole thing is played backwards and the more that we know the less Leo knows. While watching you really have to pay attention because how each scene begins is how the next one ends, but often it will be difficult to remember how it began because you will be pulled into the conflict of the story. <br/><br/>Leonard Shelby is wonderfully played by Guy Pearce who earlier acted in the cop drama L.A Confedential, which in both of these movies he shows what kinds of talents he has on the screen. Christopher Nolan, the Writer/Director of Memento is one of Hollywood's greatest directors, he has done Insomnia(not based on the Stephen King book) with Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hillary Swank. Just Recently he has directed the thrilling Batman Begins which has an a list cast including Christian Bale, Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes. In Memento Nolan shows us how the character thinks because Leo will know something and then the next minute he would have completely forgotten the whole thing. <br/><br/>To help himself remember things Leo will take pictures of people and places such as the hotel he is staying and Natalie(Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy Gammel(Joe Pantoliano), without these pictures th movie would be a total mess and would not be nearly and good. Nolans brother Johnathon wrote the short story of Memento which is supposed to be a really good story. If you have not yet seen it you should try to as soon as you can because after you will not be able to forget about it."

","I've always been wanting to see Memento, most of all because it got an 8.6 rating and I heard it's one of the best mysterious films. So I finally got to see the movie last night. This 113 min long film was worth watching. The backtracking motion of Leonard's days trying to avenge his wife's death was extremely original. Christopher Nolan used excellent directing and the script writer was brilliant. Guy Pearce, I thought played a great performance as Leonard who has short term memory loss and has to use notes everyday on camera photos to get back what he's looking for. I thought it was a very surprising role for Guy Pearce. The movie does get confusing, a bit. I would focus really hard on it to see what's really going on because you might not like the movie if your not paying a whole lot of attention to it. Overall, an excellent mystery that I highly recommend!<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"
"ryan_kuhn","9","1","3","13 February 2005"," ""Now... where was I?""
","Christopher Nolan gives us two things to think about with Memento. One is what would it be like if you couldn't remember what you did 5 minutes ago. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby who lost his ability to hold on to short term memory after an altercation in his home, where his wife was murdered. Ever since then, Shelby has been trying to track down the murder of his wife, armed with a Poleroid Camera and a pen to tattoo his body with important notes, jotting down notes before he forgets what to write down. Nolan also complicates matters (or challenges the audience) by telling the story backwards, we see the last scene first, and the first scene of the movie, if told linearly, last. This adds mystery to an intriguing story, as we find out things about the characters after we see how they react. Between the scenes, we watch Shelby talk on the phone, to who we don't know, but it fill us in on his disorder and how much he remembers before his accident. Leonard Shelby lives like he died one day, and he sleeps walk through the rest of his life. Joe Pantoliano plays an auto mechanic who may or may not be helping Shelby through his ordeals, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays a woman who may or may not be helping Shelby as well. Much like a Tarantino film, the time warping used by Memento is a gimmick that actually enhances the story. While we see what happened last first, the story, what we are shown, works linearly, the climax of the story would be the first scene in the movie, but here, it's last and fits in much better. The filler material that we see between action sequences adds depth to the emotional torture Shelby goes through. Pearce plays Shelby very well, acting confused when he should be confused, the film never takes shortcuts. For once, the audience knows just as much about everything as the main character does, putting the audience on an even level as the character, we're not going to hear him say something just out of the blue. We all try to put the pieces together, and that puts us in the movie. Just like the Seinfeld episode that was backwards, you have to pay attention, we know where we are going, now, where were we?"
"norse76","10","1","3","1 February 2005"," What A Rush...
","When I first heard about this film, I was curious. Playing with time, while not a completely original concept, could make a film feel gimmicky and artsy. I am happy to say that this is not the case with ""Memento"", a clever and twisted thriller that makes the audience sympathize with the lead character by giving them, in essence, the same lack of info that the protagonist has. By telling the story in the fashion that the writer and director have chosen, if you don't pay keen attention to every line and every character, the film will definitely lose it's impact. The final twist is a whopper that I never saw coming and yet I didn't feel at all cheated. On the contrary, I wanted to watch it again (which I did immediately) and see if I could pick up on clues (which there are in abundance). If you like movies that challenge you to think while you watch, give this one a try."
"kellyk10210","10","1","3","26 January 2005"," Things are not what they seem
","I am baffled by how many of you are trying to analyze and dissect the ""plot"" of this movie i.e. ""nobody could live with this kind of a disorder"", ""Leonard Shelby is not convincing...he should be grief stricken if he can remember his wife's death"", ""why does he remember some things in the movie and not others?"" My interpretation of this is plain and simple. He IS the killer with a sociopathic personality. He feels nothing. He has convinced himself he did NOT do it. He is seeking the ""real killer"" (like O.J. looking for Nicole's killer on the golf course.) All throughout this movie, we have sympathy for Leonard Shelby because we are basically seeing things through his eyes (as disjointed as they may be). Then strange ""unexplainable"" things happen that make one question what is really going on. Why can Leonard remember some things and not others etc.? Why is he not acting like a grief stricken man? We, as viewers, are conditioned not to believe these little tidbits of evidence as reality as they are introduced to us because we have already formed this bond with Leonard and his mission. But truth be told, I had cold chills up my spine in the end when it dawns on me that Leonard's memory may very well be selective and pathological and not a true, memory disorder. Now where was I? One of the best last lines I can recall in recent memory. (Smiles)"

"theriotisover","9","1","3","20 January 2005"," Editing is never random.
","**minor spoilers**<br/><br/>---Pieces are shown a number of times with no real linear link between them, just like it would be if we ourselves had a memory disorder, and then they are cut up and edited next to things that happen either before or after it.----<br/><br/>The sequencing is actually another part of Memento's masterful construction. The first scene, during the credits, is the only scene in which the action unfolds in reverse. This both sets up the momentum of the film, and sets up the ""fragility"" theme--part of Lenny's existential crisis is that his actions may not be meaningful if the evidence of them, the photos he takes as mementos, can be easily destroyed. Since he is unable to make a memory, he doesn't *remember* anything when he sees the photos, thus they are not *reminders* but *mementos* whose meanings can easily be altered or destroyed entirely. Lenny bases all his actions on his mementos. He chooses to destroy Teddy's photo because that effectively ""erases"" the action of his murder from Lenny's archive of mementos. <br/><br/>But I digress...<br/><br/>The first scene actually unfolds in reverse motion. Subsequently, all of the color scenes take place in reverse chronological order. The intercut black and white scenes occur in forwards chronological order. The last scene of the movie is actually the middle of the story; the events unfold both backwards and forward until they collide in the middle, at the moment of Teddy's murder. To use the alphabet as an example, after the credits scene, the story unfolds in this sequence: Z, A, Y, B, X, C.... with Z, Y, X... being in black and white and A, B, C... being in color. <br/><br/>It's the classic film noir flashback on acid."
"q-taran","9","1","3","12 January 2005"," We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who are....
","This undoubtedly is a masterpiece of cinema. Shot in both B/W and color, with wonderful choppy editing that sucks you in and a soundtrack that jolts you back to reality.....but what is that? In Leonard Shelby's world, he can never be sure. Or if he does, he doesn't remember. He suffers from short term memory loss, a result of an attacker that raped and murdered his wife. He tries to find her killer, as he wanders around, using a series of Polaroids and tattoos as his guides. Leonard doesn't know who he can trust, who's using him, who he has met, and if they've hurt him before. <br/><br/>Pearce brings a beautifully subtle performance as Leonard, haunted by the past, because that's all he can remember. Despite his organized system, we see him struggle just to function. By reversing all the sequences of events, Nolan allows us to only know as much as Leonard knows. Moss and Pantaliano are a strong supporting cast, and you don't know if they're allies or enemies. <br/><br/>This film may require several viewings. It is worth it. As soon as you think you know what's happening, another fragmented, misplaced idea will surface. You will find yourself confused, lost, trying to remember what happened before. You will find yourself like Leonard. That is Nolan's trick. And he pulls out the rabbit, and doesn't disappoint."

","I can't believe this movie didn't get more media coverage! I loved it! It had everything- a mysterious, fast-moving plot, brilliant camera-work, awesome actors...wow! Perhaps it isn't the perfect movie for those who prefer light comedies and classic Hollywood entertainment. Memento, on the other hand, is melancholy and thought-provoking. There is a bit of violence, but this only contributes to the overall perfect darkness of the film. I highly suggest renting it, buying it, etc. Just make sure you watch it from beginning to end, (though it is almost impossible not to, as the plot is so captivating). Just don't expect cheer and fun. Instead, expect to be shaken from the first scene to the last."

","Yes, Memento is THAT good.<br/><br/>The entire movie is played backwards (in 10 minute intervals) that surprisingly works. The reason why it's done this way because Lenny (the main character) has a condition, he can't remember things for more than 10 minutes (and at the end, you'll find out why it's being played in reverse, but I don't want to spoil anything). The only way he can remember is to tattoo words/phrases on his body, he uses this to track down his wife's killer......John G. <br/><br/>Superb writing, directing, acting etc. (I could go on forever) but one of the main reasons I liked it so much is because it makes you think........a lot. During the movie, after the movie (I'm still thinking about it now, and I saw it 2 weeks ago) it's just so awesome.

","Review: Every now and then, were given a movie which makes us think during sleep, makes us discuss it with friends/family, redefines our lifestyle, changes our outlook on things, etc etc. This is one of those movies... The filmstyle is superb, I won't say anything to spoil the movie but rather explain the style of its approach. The movie starts off in the end and it sequentially plays 'backwards' towards the start of the movie. A very ingenious method of filming, it leaves us guessing in the end (or shall I say start?). Easter eggs (I won't say which!) also linger in the movie which increases the question/discussion count. The character development is superb as it is the only movie to my recollection which 'un'develops the character. ALthough it might be confusing for a first viewing, watching it a second time will make the viewer yearning for more just to get his/her questions answered. Acting is superb, we are left with no hint of overacting or underacting in all cases. I would recommend for all to watch it at LEAST 2 times for the full effect of complete heavenly satisfaction.<br/><br/>10/10 - Better keep this as a memento..."
"XIOMANGER","10","1","3","26 October 2004"," I had a summary, but my memory is too fallible!
","Right when I began watching the movie, since the very moment that picture in the opening credits started disappearing and the initial kill, I wondered is this just one of those gimmick movies or will they actually follow through with this idea till the end. <br/><br/>I say this because, without a doubt, the idea of a movie played entirely in reverse (as opposed to flashbacks or other narrative non-linear-story-telling devices) is quite bold and unconventional, at least before other movies such as Irreversible started copying Memento. That this reverse storytelling serves a purpose to actually for the most part enter the world of our character is even more worthy of compliment. Instead of knowing the past we know the future, which is of little use as the future itself has to be redefined each time we go further into the past. The fact the movie comes up with fresh ways of challenging our perceptions of the future is another plus for it. The film-noir atmosphere is another plus. Guy Pearce's acting and conveying the emotions of an eternally heartbroken and disoriented person is yet another plus. Finally, an ending which completely and profoundly reverses all expectations, not only of all preceding events (in the future) but also of what these movies are genrewise supposed to be like, quite simply settles it for me. This movie is more than worthy of a 10.<br/><br/>Memento is another one of those superb and almost perfect movies which is a joy to watch over and over again and continually ponder not just its plot but also the philosophical and emotional issues it raises.<br/><br/>Rating 10/10<br/><br/>Scale:<br/><br/>Positive opinion of a movie: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK<br/><br/>Neutral opinion of a movie: 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre<br/><br/>Negative opinion of a movie: 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE"

","How Can I Heal If I Can't Feel Time?<br/><br/>MEMENTO Director: Christopher Nolan Year: 2000 Starring: Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano, Carrie Ann Moss<br/><br/>""Once is right for this movie. Confusion is the state we are intended to be in."" - Roger Ebert<br/><br/>I looked over our top 100 list and saw my favorite movie so I thought it would be perfect to make my own review. Memento didn't have the clout movies like the Passion did when it came out, although it didn't do bad at box offices it wasn't played everywhere thereby not many people heard of it. My story with Memento began with an episode of ""Cribs"" where a celebrity recommended it. Then a few years later IMDb had it #14 on it's greatest list. I had to see it after reading about it.<br/><br/>Memento is a thriller defined. Something Hitchcock or Kubrick would probably praise. The plot in simplicity isn't large. A man with brain damage trying to avenge his wife's killer/rapist. But Nolan defeats this slight flaw by complicating it without changing what happens, but when it happens. We open with a Polaroid being held of a dead man, shot. Slowly the polaroid undevelopes and then is returned into the camera, your rewind button is not busted. We then witness the reverse murder of a mysterious man. Then CUT, we go to a B&W scene of a man explaining his condition, setting the basis for his problem. then CUT, to a color scene, right before the murder, showing how it was led to, then after it happens again in forward, cut to another B&W scene, this is the pattern of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie follows the plot of Leonard Shelby, dubbed ""the ultimate protagonist"" by some editorials. Lenny is a man who witnessed his wife rapped and murder, he kills the man, and is hit by another which renders him handicapped. Leonard cannot remember things for more then 15-30 minutes. He tattoos important facts on him about the killer, etc. and carries polaroids to remember places/people. The story starts with the end and climaxes with the first thing that happened [realistically].<br/><br/>Nolan constructed it greatly with the use of BW scenes and color. And how he meets these scenes [BW ones take place before the color ones]. There are many interpretations, especially people who like to get mental. Unlike Ebert, I think there should be multiple viewings because it makes the movie greater and you see the new things you missed. Nolan means for us to identify with the main character, by showing us his story through HIS perspective. Confusion. We start with the end with ignorance as we learn more of each character, their different intentions and even then they could be reversed if you pay attention but I will not spoil it.<br/><br/>In my opinion Nolan made a masterpiece and it is at least within the top 10 or 15 greatest ever. The parts are not over or underacted. Hell, I even hear that Memento is shown in Psychology courses as a character study. Nolan tested directed in Following and perfected it in Memento.<br/><br/>10/10 #1 Favorites"

","Memento, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, is one film that takes the viewer on a ride they will never forget. Beginning with an ingenious and original view of a Polaroid fading instead of developing, where everything goes backwards for a minute. The movie has a lot of great dialogue and great set-up points, told in a unique way that helps you deal with what the character is going through.<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby, a man on a vendetta to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, has no short-term memory. He relies on notes and tattoos and photographs to get him through finding out who murdered his wife. But as the film progresses at ten minute intervals that go for ten minutes and then goes on for the ten minutes before that ten, you start to realize that all is not as it seems.<br/><br/>The screenplay and the editing were nominated for Academy Awards, and the film was greater than that to deserve just two nominations. Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Mosse do excellent jobs in their roles, breathing life into these rich and detailed characters. Christopher Nolan is a genius to be reckoned with, and Memento is a movie that will live on as one of the best ever filmed."

","While I really admire the film-making and creativity in this movie, its story telling technique becomes rather tedious after the first hour. Even though Memento breaks the story-telling mold by showing you events in reverse order, the plot is quite linear. By the halfway point I found there were no surprises left; and after being dragged through every scene twice in the course of a single viewing I felt as if I'd sat through a 3 hour marathon. The acting is superb however. Guy Pierce and Carrie-Anne Moss have amazingly twisted chemistry that unfortunately doesn't run throughout the whole film. The interaction between the characters and the intriguing script keep the viewer involved even through some lugubrious scenes. Overall: over-rated, but worth watching."

","I don't like film noir for the same reason I don't like modern art.  Modern art is cool because it is incomprehensible, providing the illusion that indulging confusion is somehow deep.  I've always thought this sort of thing was a kind of joke where the artist laughs quietly at our efforts to inject chaos with false genius.  Or maybe I just don't get it.<br/><br/>To be incomprehensible because of intellectual prowess may be admirable, but to be incomprehensible due to little more than obscure confusion is annoying.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is that the plot is simply not resolved.  Whether or not this is intentional, I honestly cannot tell.  We are given an explanation in the penultimate scene that is presented in a manner that simply invites us to ask more questions which ultimately go unanswered and leaves the audience to make up their own mind.  If possible.<br/><br/>Honestly, this little trick was old a long time ago and has not become less annoying with age.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that the film is captivating.  I desperately wanted my answers and enjoyed the highly experimental sequencing.  But the director owes me an answer.  He owes me a story.  He owes me a conclusion. <br/><br/>
And we never get one.  Or maybe I just don't get it.  <br/><br/>If you want something that's different and kind of cool in the end, watch The Sixth Sense or Fight Club.  You won't lose sleep trying to figure them out because they actually have a conclusion."

","My husband & I are the legal guardians of a multiply handicapped young man. One of his handicaps is short-term memory damage. Sometimes a passing comment sticks like super glue in his mind, but mostly, a LOT of repetition is needed to allow him to remember events, objects, and people. His time frame is different, too; time for him goes verrry sllloooowwwwwllllyyy. I firmly believe that he doesn't lie, but he has a great need to fill in memory gaps, sometimes with very surprising stories. Therefore, because of my tie with this young man, I have an abiding interest in human memory.<br/><br/>I have come to see how very personal and ephemeral memory truly is. Concepts like ""truth"" and ""fact"" are plastic even at the best of times, but in memory-damaged brains, can become downright syrupy. Time can become meaningless. I think this film captures these predicaments very well. The reverse editing of the film shows Pearce's character, Shelby, moving from shakier ground backward to firmer. That must be what short term memory damage must feel like - shaky ground. <br/><br/>I had last seen Guy Pearce in ""Adventures of Pricilla, Queen of the Desert"", so this was, of course, a very different role. Luckily, unlike my guardianee, Shelby had learned to read before his brain trauma or the search for the criminal would have been moot! Pearce did a great job displaying all the emotions and conflict Shelby went through to try to accomplish his very difficult task. I found this film to be profound and still think about it today.<br/><br/>Thank you."

The subtle, dark humor -- You can pretty quickly overlook the humor if you get too wrapped up in trying to figure out the plot. 2.) The directing and scene sequencing 3.)

","When I first heard about this movie I hired it on DVD not really knowing quite what to expect. The first scene (or is that last?!) shows a man being killed by a gun but filmed in reverse. Thankfully the rest of the film is not people walking around in reverse etc but carefully layered scenes, each new one set chronologically before the previous.<br/><br/>This opens up endless possibilities of twists, turns and humour, which Christopher Nolan takes full advantage of. Guy Pearce is at his absolute best playing Leonard Shelby, the man who cannot make new memories due to an injury sustained whilst himself and his wife were attacked. He therefore has an uphill task finding the true murderer of his dead wife which he has now set as his only goal in life.<br/><br/>Matrix stars Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano give excellent support in this gripping and original tale which may take at least a couple of viewings to completely get your head round.<br/><br/>The great concept, acting, score and of course editing make this an unmissable thriller."

","'Memento's' plot backtracks through the events that led up to the point when the viewer begins watching it. Although for years movies have been using flashback sequences to tell their stories this one actually rewinds and overlaps it just enough to keep you abreast. At the beginning of the movie the viewer feels much like Guy Pearce's character in that they know as much about what happened and why as he does. Anyone who has a problem with their short term memory should feel much sympathy for him and anyone who doesn't should, at least, see how it can be taken for granted.

","Who can honestly say how good their memory is? I know I can't, which is what I loved about Memento.<br/><br/>Premise: A young, former insurance investigator is searching for the men who raped and murdered his wife.<br/><br/>Here's the snag though. He has no short term memory and thus can't make new memories. People he's met and places he been vanish in a blink after 20 or so minutes. He has to constantly remind people of who he is, tells the same story of Sammy Jenkis over and over again, doesn't like to talk on the phone (he likes to look people in the face when he talks to them), takes photos and jots down who or what they are, has tattoo's all over his body as clues to finding his wife's rapist and killer. I could go on, but you get the point. It's a remarkably interesting structure to be taken through.<br/><br/>Remember I said I couldn't rely on my memory a great deal and how that's what I loved about Memento? That's what made the film so incredible was the premise that memory is not 100% reliable. I loved being taken on a ride during this movie where I was confused as hell, lol. It was so much fun to have to force my brain to work harder at thinking about what was going on in this film. I left the theatre baffled as to what and how things had happened, but at the same time I couldn't stop thinking about the film.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is beyond superb. The editing and photography is even better. The best part: the film starts at the end and works it way to a middle point. Noticed I didn't say beginning? That's because when the film comes to it's end you really don't know if it's the beginning since you don't know what Leonard (Guy Pierce) did before arriving at an isolated place. This film can really be seen as remniscent of the film style of Film Noir. It uses black and white scenes to give that off as well as the characters in the film constantly sucking Leonard further down into this world where he has no idea who and what to believe, including himself and the things he's done. Not only that but all the characters, yes even Leonard who is our protagonist, has a dark side of human nature to them. And that's what Film Noir is, exposing the dark side of human nature. The film has such a great Psychological deepness and by all means breaks the conventional art that goes into filmmaking. It really was a shame this film wasn't nominated for best picture. It greatly deserved that award and Nolan greatly deserved best director."

At first, we weren't sure if the telling of the story backwards would work, but after the movie started, we found ourselves fixated on the screen trying desperately to put the pieces together so as to understand what led to the initial scene and then, just when we thought we had it figured out, the movie ends leaving a finger of doubt in our minds.

","First off I would like to add my kudo to the pile of stars that this film has accumulated on imdb.  It is indeed every bit the cinematic brilliance that its rating suggests and ,in fact, I rented it solely on the rating it had received here on the imdb (part of a little experiment that I was doing to see how well my tastes matched up with those of everyone else).  The film is rife with existential commentary which in the end seems to be the point of the film.  For some individuals this film may be difficult to watch as you are forced to trace the main character's bizarre brand of introspection through a sequence of events and narration that are delivered to you in reverse chronological order.  Our minds perceive time in a linear fashion so out of sequence filming can be an absolute disaster as many film makers have discovered.  In Memento any confusion that results from this sequencing technique is absolutely necessary for the movie to be understood (understanding through confusion, sounds kinda zen).  Well, enough said about this film's greatness.  If you haven't already seen Memento give it try."

","I've just watched Memento and was amazed that such superb films can still be made these days in comparison to the mass-media crap that has been the norm for way too many years now.  I'd certainly put it on a par with 12 Monkeys and The Sixth Sense in terms of a film made to invoke audience intelligence.<br/><br/>Actually my wife and I watched it flabberghasted at the detail and puzzle of each moment as it unfolded. Each trying to answer the final answer as the film ran it's course.<br/><br/>Since watching it, I availed myself of the many sites dedicated to unfolding the mysteries within the movie. At first I was unclear to the conjecture and *myths"" within the confounds of a basically simple film.  Then as I was drawn into the numerous (and often) quirky and deep reverential references made (or supposed) and found myself drawn into the ideas based on much effort and imagination based on investigation unequalled for a movie as this.<br/><br/>In fact I read so much as to the unanswered (and guessed at) in this movie that it spoilt my initial enjoyment - and came to this simple conclusion: Leonard cannot cope with life without the impetus to find his wife's killer at all costs. It is this simple emotion that drives him and keeps him alive. Without it he has no reason to live.  The STM leads only to the next time he has to chase his next ""victim"". Without this reason to find his wife's killer he may well as be dead.  That's why when he gives ""himself"" information about Teddy at the ""start"" of the film, with the numberplate, he leaves himself another time-period to find his wife's killer again. How many times this has happened? But does it matter, because this film is a snapshot of a few days of Leonards life - what happened before who knows (apart from being coerced by a bent cop) and after - whatever?<br/><br/>This mans whole life is driven by love.  A love for a dead wife, who's rapist and murderer he must seek to destroy to keep his own life.<br/><br/>
NO he is not Sammmy. STM is very rare to this extent and I feel this focus is to reinforce Leonard's own mental state.<br/><br/>I liked this film a lot.

Highly astute director Christopher Nolan simultaneously deconstructs the film noir genre while at the same time gives the audience the feeling that they are suffering from the same malady as the protagonist searching for his wife's killer.  The brilliant structure actually gave me short-term memory loss when I first watched it.  When was the last time a movie actually made you feel what it was portraying so acutely?

It's probably the first film that is told back to front, the film ending with how it should start. This is a concept that, prior to this, had never been attempted before. And there are plenty of twists that will leave you gob-smacked. The story is set in a realisticly tacky, daytime suburban L.A.

"cinquad","10","1","3","13 October 2002"," Incredibly good movie
","Warning! This contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Memento is, in my opinion, the best movie released in the past five years. It has vision that no movie since or before has really been able to capture. Memento is a movie about memory and how it can be manipulated and changed to fit people's desires. Lenny believes that he suffers from short-term memory loss suffered when he tried to break up an attack on his wife. But one of the main questions that the movie seems to imply is if Lenny found out about the diagnosis after the attack (after he lost his memory), how can he remember that he suffers from it? The question can not be answered without making some parts of the movie seem impossible, and that is where the true strength of the movie lies.<br/><br/>It is impossible to draw up a definitive theory about Memento that explains everything without making some things appear impossible. However, it is a great deal of fun to try. I've discussed this movie with friends for hours on end. Whenever we think we have it all explained, our answers just lead to more questions. This is a sort of courage that most filmmakers today do not have. Most movies end with very clear-cut endings that leave little to the imagination. Memento is about the imagination and how you remember details in the movie. It may just be me, but for some reason the backwards plot of the movie with the black-and-white cuts in between makes it impossible for me to remember details even on repeat viewings.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the definitive scene in the movie is not Teddy's revelations at the end, but the small scene in the coffee shop where Teddy and Lenny talk about memory. This is where the movie's themes become obvious, and also where Lenny presents some of the more intriguing philosophical questions. He argues that memory is unreliable, that it distorts facts according to what people want to see. This can be applied to how people view the movie (what facts they remember and what theories they draw up), and also to how we view life itself.<br/><br/>All the acting in this movie is incredible. Guy Pearce deserved an Oscar nomination for his portrayel of the confused Lenny, and the Teddy actor was perfect for the part.<br/><br/>This is a movie that I've seen a dozen times and continue to love. It is absolutely incredible."

The telling of this story of a guy who forgot his immediate memory, but kept his identity, and seems to be looking for the killer of his wife, the one who triggered 'the incident' - is technically brilliant, but lacks any feeling, and does not produce any emotion in the viewer.

","For this film I can forgive Guy Pierce his Neighbours-based sins, as he delivers the character of Lenny with touching compassion. Do not be deceived - this is the best film of all time - although born as a concept movie the direction takes it far beyond that.<br/><br/>Lenny suffers from extreme short-term memory loss bought on when his wife was raped and murdered (although cynics may say it was bought on by the demands of the script), and is eager to seek revenge. The film exists in two parts: the colour sequences happening in reverse chronology and the monochrome in forward. Eventually the two sequences meet at the scene of a bloody murder. The murder of Lenny's best friend Teddy then becomes brutally apparent...<br/><br/>This film intends to confuse, and therefore deserves multiple viewings. Although contrived, the memory-loss-thing works flawlessly (think Fight Club). It is interesting to view Teddy with contempt at the beginning of the film, and develop an increasing sympathy for him as time goes on (or back) - eventually seeing him as an innocent victim of circumstance.

He is able to remember everything up to the injury, but is left unable to process new information into memory.  I made an attempt to find if such a condition really exists, and I believe it does. I do not think the following constitutes a spoiler, but if you are worried about it, just stop here and see the movie twice.<br/><br/>It may be that you too will give it a very high rating on first viewing if I tell you that the director-script writer (Christopher Nolan) and the editor have made the film as if they suffered from the same brain damage as the lead character.  His inability to store new information means that there is no sequence in his mind as he is reminded of what he has never remembered by the notes and Polaroid photographs he has taken to substitute for the memory he has does not have.   He boasts that he has an orderly system, but it doesn't always work.<br/><br/>The casting is great. Guy Pearce carries a lot of authority and charm, and Carrie Anne Moss is very good as his helper."

","Memento was my favorite movie of 2000, hands down.  After seeing the movie, the crowd waited around in amazement trying to figure out what they just viewed.  The official web-site (memento spelled backwards) is a help in unraveling the story. The movie however is  a bit heavy and requires active participation of the audience, so do not see this while drowsy!  The style of the movie itself is directly related to the plot, placing the viewer in the title characters mind-set. And from my personal experience (I have had short term memory problems, following brain surgery)the story is an incredible view into the meaning of memory.  See it now!"
"ecummins86","Null","1","3","18 May 2002"," How reliable is your memory really?
","First off I'd like to start by saying that whoever made a comment prior to mine, Leonard Shelby's condition is that he has no SHORT-term memory, not LONG-term. If your gonna review the film make sure everything you know about a film as good as this was is right.<br/><br/>Memento is unlike any movie you'll see or have ever seen. The plot seems simple enough, but don't let that mislead you about the film itself. Memento is an original film-noir film adapted from a short story by Director Christopher Nolan's brother Johnathan Nolan about a man named Leonard Shelby who is an Insurance Investigator who finds his wife raped and murdered. Lenni (whoops sorry, he hates people calling him that) ah, Leonard intrudes on the rape and murder and ends up with a condition. This condition makes it so that he cannot make any new memories. Even with this new handicap of his he still wishes to exact revenge on his wife's rapist and killer. However, it's the structure of the movie that will leave you perplexed and questioning everything you've seen even after the last frame of film. The structure may seem complex almost as if it's non-linear, but it is in fact very linear. It has only been reversed so that story starts at the end of the film and works it way to the beginning making it so that the next scene relies upon the scene prior to it.<br/><br/>Director Christopher Nolan (Following, Insomnia), creates an orginal film-noir film where you the audience are literally put exactly into Leonard Shelby's shoes thereby not allowing you to be capable of empathizing with Shelby since you too are just as confused as to what's going on as he is. After thinking you've just about figured everything out about what's going on (although with this film even by the end that still shouldn't be possible) the film's ""climatic ending"" (remember this films goes in reverse from end to beginning) completely turns everything you thought to be true upside down and has you leaving the theatre questioning everything that took place.<br/><br/>Not that that's a bad thing though. I personally loved leaving the theatre after seeing that and continuing to try and make sense of it all. I think what I loved most about it was that it wasn't a straight psychological film-noir thriller. Nolan makes sure to add in snippets of humor throughout the film just to keep the audience from not getting too consumed in what's going on. For instance Leonard is hiding in the bathroom of a motel room holding a bottle of wine and waiting for someone (this obviously is not his room since he is hiding like he is waiting for someone who may know something). He looks down at the wine bottle and in a short voice over monologue ponders, ""Hmmm, I don't feel drunk."" Lines like that and, ""Okay, so what am I doing? Oh, I'm chasing this guy. No, he's chasing me."" is sure to get chuckles from the audience knowing how bad Shelby's condition is and the fact that one second ago he knew how he got into the situation he's currently in, but then the next he's wondering why something in particular is happening to him.<br/><br/>All and all Memento is truly a one of kind film in today's film industry. It's message is pretty clear in my opinion and that is that our memories are not perfect so how can we rely on it 100%? It may leave you confused and pondering everything that happened in it, but honestly: would you constantly always want to see a movie that didn't make you think about an important asset like our memories? There's something new for you to ponder."

This is the most clever and original film I have ever seen, and although at first it is a bit hard to understand because of the complex way the story is told, once you've got the hang of it you'll be enthralled. Guy Pearce is just the most natural actor I've seen, and gives a mesmerising performance, you can really feel his anger and fustration. His character is also very funny at times, especially in the scene where he discovers Dodd in his cuboard, and can't remember how he got there.<br/><br/>This film is a must see, but if you don't want to use your brain, then don't see it!

"Buddy-51","Null","1","3","31 December 2001"," ingenious tour de force
","Christopher Nolan's mind-bending thriller `Memento' is one of those rare instances in which the form of a movie is designed to match its content. Here is a film all about the nature of short-term memory, which, by its own ingenious structure, challenges the audience to cope with its own mastery of short-term memory.  <br/><br/>Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, a man who suffers from a `condition' brought on by a trauma to the head that prevents him from being able to retain any short-term memories (he can remember his life only up to the moment of his wife's rape and murder).  To cope with his affliction, Leonard writes himself copious notes, mostly on the backs of polaroids he takes on a regular basis but sometimes on his own body in the form of informational tattoos.  To approximate the sense of dislocation of time and place that Leonard feels on a daily basis  as he has to reorient himself to people and events he has recently met and since forgotten - Nolan has chosen to structure his film in a backward progression, so that the first scene ends up being the most recent and the final scene the earliest in time.  This technique is not exactly an original one, since the 1983 movie `Betrayal' used roughly the same format in the context of a romantic drama.  Still, `Memento' deserves enormous credit not only for trusting its audience to be able to cope with this complex style but for managing to keep most of the plot details well-focused and coherent for most of the film's duration.<br/><br/>One of the risks of a film like `Memento' is that it could, if handled badly, easily become a mere exercise in technical `gimmickry.'  One of the ways that Nolan avoids that trap is by devising a plot that is as gripping as any to be found in a traditionally structured example of film noir. `Memento' is filled with the kinds of narrative twists and turns, surprise revelations and moral ambiguities that form the basis for any good example of the genre.  More important, Nolan makes Leonard a compellingly sympathetic character, one whom we come to care for because his plight is so heartrending at its core.  Here is a man who not only has to deal with the immense incomprehensibilities of his life but who cannot even benefit from the time factor that helps mourning people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.  To Leonard, his wife's death is a perpetual recent event, one from which he can never attain that emotional distance so key to finally overcoming his grief.<br/><br/>Special note should be taken of Guy Pearce, who delivers a knockout performance as Leonard, perfectly capturing the determination, frustration and emotional pain that define the character.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano offer superb support as two perpetual `strangers' who play significant roles in Leonard's strangely dislocated and fragmented life  yet just what those roles are is as much a mystery to us as it is to Leonard.  David Julyan's subtle and haunting musical score and Wally Pfister's fine cinematography greatly contribute to the unique quality of the film.<br/><br/>Watching `Memento' is like entering a strange, mystical dream.  Like Leonard, we feel as if we have suddenly been stripped of that ability to fully make sense out of the chaotic world around us.  We feel cut loose from our mental moorings and find ourselves adrift in a world bereft of the rules of chronological reasoning we cling to so desperately for survival.  How many movies actually manage to shift our paradigm of perception and make us look anew at the way we observe the world around us?  Not many, I can assure you.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan's brilliant and audacious cinematic tour de force reawakens our faith in the medium and those who dare to challenge it."

","""Everyone complains of his memory, and no one complains of his judgement.""--Francois, Duc de La Rochefoucauld, ""Reflections; or Sentences and Moral Maxims"", 1678<br/><br/>The above is a very good quotation to keep in mind as one watches ""Memento"". Believe me, it all makes sense in the final context.<br/><br/>My main attraction to this movie was Guy Pierce (whom I became acquainted with via ""L.A. Confidential"") and the nature of the story. Having heard a little of short term memory impairment via a ""20/20"" show long, long ago (as I recall, I believe the particular instances cited were the result of a disease transmitted by eating mussels), I thought that it would be interesting to see how a mystery was being investigated by a man with the same problem. My reaction was the same that I got from watching ""The Limey"". It was NOTHING like I was expecting.<br/><br/>The opening sequence sets the tone straight away, up the hill backwards, to borrow a phrase from David Bowie. Like a surreal slideshow, we flash backward and forward from the beginning and end points of Lenny's week(?) to figure out basically what the hell is going on (one of Nolan's smartest moves was to film the earliest sequences in black and white and the time just prior to the opening in color to reduce audience confusion). At first, I believed Lenny because he seemed so calm, rational, and assured in spite of his obvious handicap. SURELY he'd know what he's talking about. (bitter chuckle) More the fool me. <br/><br/>The whole of his world is constricted to five minutes at a time. Five minutes where every incident, every insult, every indignity that is heaped on him is flensed from his mind like a stain exposed to bleach unless he considers it important enough to write down. How could one possibly trust such a man who's forgotten why he's running away from a man with a gun (indeed, forgotten that he's being chased and not chasing), that his wife was called a whore by a woman who is supposedly helping him, or that said woman spat into a tankard that he then thoughtlessly drinks from...all of it instantly forgotten at the end of his memory cutoff? Nolan deserves additional credit for not letting Lenny off the hook at the end. Yeah, we can see that he's been used by a few folks, but he's no innocent himself.<br/><br/>In a weird way, it reminds me of ""Point Blank"", another one-of-its-kind crime film with some very unorthodox storytelling methods. It had the same sort of flat characterizations (not necessarily a fault, to my mind; watch one of the many versions of ""Hamlet"" if you want characters), the feeling of being unstuck in time, and a protagonist with rigid but flawed moral compass. But there are important differences. ""Point Blank"" was like living someone's life the same way Kurt Vonnegut wrote ""Slaughterhouse Five"". ""Memento"" is like watching a couple of cars start at opposite ends of a long street and end up hitting each other in a head-on collision. The resulting smash-up, as well as that last, casual line, will haunt me for the weeks the way ""Sunset Boulevard"" did. Watch it and see if it doesn't do the same for you."
"robotman-1","Null","1","3","20 October 2001"," The Stopped-Time Man
","A man who cannot create new memories cannot move forward in time. For Leonard Shelby, time stopped the instant he suffered head trauma while trying to save his wife during a robbery-rape. Unable to retain any new memories, Leonard will never move past that horrific event in which he lost his wife, his home, and everything else except an all-consuming drive for revenge on those responsible.<br/><br/>There's reason for enthusiasm and hyperbole from folks who see MEMENTO: it's a film that harkens back to the 1970s, a time of well-written, mind-blowing experiences that become part of the viewer, like an actual event, a memory. MEMENTO is that modern rarity, a character-driven story that refuses to flinch, and viewers appreciate it. After all, in this decade of putrid, talentless filmmaking, where would movies (American anyway) be without Tarantino's Jules Winnfield, or Mr. White? Or the Coens' Dude? Soderbergh's limey Wilson? Or Keyser Soze? Characters with force of will, who follow their natures and dominate space and time, as real people met, inawed-by, or feared.<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby's story is ingrained in truth, and believability. A two-dimensional creation lives and breathes. He becomes part of the viewer.<br/><br/>There is nothing worse than the Hell of Leonard Shelby, a man cursed to a single moment in time, his wife's rape-murder, and his inability to even remember whatever revenge he may take. The concept alone guarantees this film is unforgettable, but it is also the writing, the direction of Nolan, and the performance of Pierce.<br/><br/>I'd like to correct the misconception of the intrinsic fault in this film, pointed out by many critics, that Leonard would be unable to remember he has a ""condition"" of complete short-term memory loss, since he should not remember anything after his injury and does not have a tattoo on his body, say, that states the fact of it, so he'd understand where, what and how he is where he is. <br/><br/>Leonard does indeed have this ""trigger"" for his understanding of his ""condition"". It is on his hand, SAMMY JANKIS. Sammy's story, part of Leonard's pre-injury life, is an automatic symbol for everything Leonard is going through, as the two men share almost the same condition, and more. Leonard sees the name and remembers, and that's the answer to that.<br/><br/>MEMENTO is a complete puzzle, a sequence of nightmare that is inescapable, a world in which a man who stops moving in time becomes the anchor for corrupt cops and lost women, where answers tear up bodies and minds like bullets. Leonard is a living weapon of revenge, and<br/><br/>lives in a perpetual state of recoil, that stunned silence between the just-fired and the impact. An incredible film."

","Memento is one of the most intriguing films I've seen in recent years, but it hardly deserves the current ranking it has in the top 250 films of all time.<br/><br/>We begin the film with the murder of the man whom our hero believes raped and killed his wife, and move backwards throughout the entire plot. Each segment moves forward narratively, but comes after the scene which follows it. Meanwhile, in black and white, we follow a short space of time somewhere in past in which Leonard talks about his life as an insurance investigator before his wife's murder.<br/><br/>The main character suffers from a brain injury, acquired at the time of his wife's murder, which has destroyed his short-term memory. He can't remember what has just happened to him, but remembers everything up to the ""incident"" - his name, his wife, his job. He deals with life in 15-minute snatches, as if he was continually waking up in a strange room. In one especially clever sequence, he is running through a trailer park with the thought, ""Okay, what am I doing? Ah. I'm chasing this guy. Wait. He's chasing me!"". He tattoos his body with important information relating to his pursuit of the man who killed his wife and destroyed his memory. He writes copious notes and takes Polaroids of people and writes crucial information about them on the back.<br/><br/>All this is simply a device, a device which sometimes transcends the relatively standard plot which accompanies it, but not always. It does make the film worth watching. One of the hallmarks of a great director is being able to take a familiar story and tell it in a way that suprises us. It succeeds. The backwards storytelling puts us in the same predicament as Leonard; we don't know what just happened before this scene. We're confused, working off what he's written on pieces of paper and Polaroid photographs, with no knowledge of what has happened before (which will be displayed to us subsequently).<br/><br/>Good system. The story, unfortunately, isn't entirely worthy of such a cool storytelling method, but it's still quite good, despite falling into some film noir cliches.<br/><br/>The directing is crisp and the innovative editing style is enjoyable. The score is unnotable. The acting from all four of the major roles is outstanding. Leonard's character is incredibly sympathetic, which is crucial to such a film, although nobody is who we think they are by the time we've rewound through time far enough to understand what has come before (after).<br/><br/>The DVD features an ability to watch the story in forward rather than reverse order, a perspective on the film I'm very much looking forward to experiencing.<br/><br/>Totally worth watching, but don't expect the greatest film you've ever seen, despite the state of the votes at the moment (11th of all time).

To pull this off and maintain smooth continuity is quite a feat, which is why this movie is such a remarkable accomplishment. We are as bewildered as Leonard (played by Guy Pearce) as he searches for the man who brutally raped and killed his wife.

","***SPOILERS*** I agree with the other comments on this movie that this is an original and fascinating film.  Kudos to everybody involved.<br/><br/>However, I found the ending of the film to be intellectually intriguing but ultimately manipulative and unsatisfying.  We are lead to believe that the beginning of the film (and ending of the ""story"") is the culmination of Lenny's search.  The man that he did kill may not be the man who truly killed his wife, but we believe that Lenny believes the man to be so.  At the end, we find that Lenny has intentionally duped himself.<br/><br/>
This ending is intellectually interesting for two reasons: (1) It says something about memory.  Without some goal to strive for, Lenny's life is meaningless and made all the more meaningless by his condition.  His decision to fool himself shows the lengths that he will go to in order to give his life meaning.  (2) The backwards formation of the movie makes us experience what Lenny does.  In the end, we are manipulated and handicapped by our ""condition,"" just as Leonard is frequently manipulated and handicapped.  As a result, there is a rhyme and reason to this manipulation, as opposed to the manipulation of the Usual Suspects, for example.<br/><br/>However, while the goal of the movie is to cheat us, and while there is a point in cheating us, I nonetheless don't like be cheated!  It left me wanting more.  Okay, this interesting thing happened, but I was ultimately drawn into the movie by the chase, a chase which was shown to be false. This left me wanting the film to go even farther back.  For example, how did Lenny know that the killer was John G?<br/><br/>Also, there are some holes and other unsatisfying elements.  Why did Teddy keep helping him?  I didn't get a good explanation of that.  And Natalie, while suggested to have a significant role in the plot, really does nothing of consequence, besides getting the license plate number for Leonard.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, but a bit too much style.  8/10"

"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","4","18 April 2017"," Not bad, but eventually too many twists and new directions
","""Memento"" is an American 110-minute movie from 2000, so not too long anymore until this one has its 20th anniversary. And a lot of its popularity such a long time later is of course because the director is Christopher Nolan from the UK, the man that many consider the most gifted filmmaker of our days, even if he still hasn't managed to get a Best Director nomination at the Oscars. But he received a nomination for his writing here as he also came up with the script together with his brother Jonathan. Nolan was only around the age of 30, maybe even under when he made this movie and it also has as many plot twists and moments that f*ck with your brain as many of his later works. So his style is easily identifiable in here. The one lead actor here is Guy Pearce and it is probably still the most known work of his career, even if he has appeared in several Best Picture winners. The supporting cast includes also several well-known names, maybe back then more than today, but still very recognizable, also several familiar faces from the small screen.<br/><br/>So this one here is the story of a man who severely suffers from short term memory loss since the day his wife got murdered. There are situations when we know just as much as he does, but the longer the film goes the more we actually find out about his illness, his background and his motivations. And also about the ways in which he manages to help himself, especially when it comes to remembering things. His body is a sheet of paper basically. So yeah, I do believe that this film has some good moments, maybe even one or two great moments. But I still must say that Nolan occasionally went over the top here in terms of trying to make this movie as smart and mind-blowing as possible. It's of course a fine line, but back then he may not yet have had the talent to deliver really convincingly and walk that fine line from start to finish. This becomes especially visible in the second half of the film. I definitely enjoyed it more in the first 45 minutes. Acting is okay by everybody, but there is also nobody who really stands out, including Pearce. This is absolutely a writer's piece. What else can I say? Oh yeah. I did not really like the fact that it wasn't chronological. But that is very frequently the case for me and just subjective approach. I don't think it is subjective though when I say that this film overall is not as creative and memorable as it turned out in Nolan's head himself. Making an argument that I and other people who don't like it that much have just not understood it is not valid. There are flaws and weaknesses here that are occasionally pretty grave. So I am still relatively generous with my 3 stars out of 5 I would say. It is a joke that it is apparently according to IMDb voters one of the best 50 (not just 250, which would already be very exaggerated) films of all time. I do recommend it, but just cautiously. Definitely one of my least favorite Nolan works (maybe my actual least favorite from his full features). Don't expect too much or you will be majorly disappointed."
"zkonedog","10","1","4","10 March 2017"," Almost Defies Explanation (A Film Told In Reverse)
","Every once in awhile, you watch a film so good, inventive, and original that it almost leaves you a bit stunned. That is exactly how I feel when I watch ""Memento"", perhaps the most perfectly-crafted movie of all times in terms of screenplay and plotting.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Memento"" tells the story of an amnesiac who cannot remember short-term events. He knows who is and basic tenants of his life, but the day-to-day details reset from time to time. Thus, this film is devoted to him trying to avenge his wife's killing and putting together the pieces of his confusing identity.<br/><br/>""Memento"" is much deeper than that above description, but to say any more would give away the fun of figuring it all out. The story is told in such a unique fashion that it will keep you guessing (but in a good way) until the very end. In what would prove to be a pattern for the Nolans going forward (especially projects in which Jonathan is attached too), the narrative does not play out in a linear format. Instead, it gives us little chunks in reverse order, so basically we see the ending first and then keep pulling back the curtain to understand the ""why"" of it all. What a concept! It takes a perfect screenplay to pull that off, and the Nolans come through easily on that front. I can only imagine the time and effort it must have taken to tell a story in this manner.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give this film, however, is that it accomplishes the feat of bending the mind yet ultimately creating a remarkably cohesive overall story. In other words, it is both very complicated and very fun to watch. I was taken on a psychological adventure and given an ending worthy of the journey. Unlike other mind-benders such as, say, ""Primer"" or ""Donnie Darko"" (that revel in the confusion they are creating), ""Memento"" accomplishes the rare feat of being equally entertaining and challenging.<br/><br/>Thus, ""Memento"" is now firmly ensconced on my ""Top Films of all-time"" list, in large part because, 18 years after its debut, there still really isn't anything like it. There's a reason why the Nolans have become such large entities in Hollywood, and it all comes back to this groundbreaking film."
"guilhermedecastro","10","1","4","17 November 2016"," Best Movie Of All Time
","Memento is by far the best film I've ever seen. The complex narrative, the themes of vengeance, memory and our illusions is superb and Guy Pearce's performance as Leonard Shelby is the best of his whole career. But in my opinion what's really so great about Memento is it's screenplay and the editing. One of the most genius and creative screenplay by Nolan that never gets you tired or bored with ambiguous and rich dialogue. David Julyan's soundtrack is masterful giving the sense of lost and craving, feelings that builds the rage that Leonard feels and how desperate he is to get that out of him. Well,I'm a big fanboy of this movie so I probably won't find any flaws so this definitely gets a 10 out 10."

","Are you bored of all the ""normal"" movies coming out today, with all their simplistic plots and all the twists you can see coming a mile away? Do you like a movie that is intelligent, unpredictable, and makes you think both during the movie and weeks after? Then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>It is a groundbreaking film that is totally out of the box. It is about a man who suffers from a condition that makes him forget things that just recently happened. Therefore, he writes notes on his body and on photographs so he can remember things. However, many of these notes are vague because he didn't have much time, and he ends up doing some things that he doesn't even know why he wanted to do it. <br/><br/>The really crazy thing about this movie, though, is the way it is told. One timeline in the movie starts at the end of the story and works backwards to the middle; the other one starts at the beginning and goes to the middle. The ""main"" storyline, the one that goes backwards, is the best because it always keeps you guessing and wondering why he wrote certain notes. There are many plot twists along the way.<br/><br/>So, basically what I'm saying is that if you haven't watched this movie, you should definitely try it. In my opinion, it is the best movie ever made."

Watch it if you'd like to discover masterpieces and if you feel you need something new: it will blow your mind. Don't watch it on a tired Friday night when your spare intelligence asks for something like American Pie or Die Hard: you will probably end up registering an account on IMDb and give it a 5... There's an edited version online where timing follows standard experience: you see it and it sounds just as your average flick (6-6.5 for my tastes). Watch this just after some ""original"" views and only if you really need to capture some details you're not able to follow up with the standard installment."

","They say that time heals but Leonard, our protagonist, asks, ""How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time""?

The Nolan movie experience certainly requires some atypical viewer adjustments. We are always shown what we need to know, but as with ""The Prestige"" we really don't want to see it. Their formula here combines loss of a spouse with a haunting guilt of culpability. The staggered murder investigation twists are presented through our protagonists' frustrating lack of short term memory. Memento has an artsy look yet an unmistakably gritty feel.

I have to tip my hat again to Mr. Nolan, because he's one of the only directors in my opinion that can find a nice median between style and substance.<br/><br/>Another big reason that I think this film is so smart is because it has an art-house feel to it. That is due to the relatively unknown cast. (Granted there not as unknown now) They include: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano. Though, truthfully if you've seen this movie, the breakout is Guy Pearce.

"roger-pettit1","6","1","4","21 June 2012"," An absorbing, complex film noir that is marred by pretentiousness
","If ever a film could be described as too clever by half it is ""Memento"". An undoubtedly entertaining thriller about revenge, it is a technically accomplished film noir that is over- reliant on its dominating gimmick: its reverse storytelling structure. That gimmick cannot, however, conceal the impression that, while it is a good film, ""Memento"" is really no better than many other films of its kind. <br/><br/>Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, and based on a short story by Jonathan Nolan (any relation, I wonder?), ""Memento"" has all the accoutrements of classic film noir: a seedy California setting; seemingly lonely and emotionally disturbed characters; motels that exploit their customers; and murder as a pivotal part of the plot. It tells the story of Leonard (Guy Pearce), whose wife called him Lenny but who likes to be addressed by everyone else by his full first name. Leonard is an ex-insurance fraud investigator. He has short-term memory difficulties - he knows who he is and can recall everything about his life before the incident in which his wife was killed. However, he has been unable to make any new memories since that traumatic event. His failure to prevent the rape and murder of his wife, and a knock on the head that he sustained during that incident, have induced in him a sort of reverse amnesia and left him with a single-minded determination for revenge. Hampered by his inability to retain new information, Leonard resorts to having his body tattooed (by himself in some instances; by a professional tattooist in others) with vital pieces of information that will assist him in the search for his wife's killer. He also takes Polaroid photos and writes notes to himself as a means of recording other important details that will help him, e.g. the location of the motel at which he is staying. Leonard is aided (or perhaps thwarted?) in his efforts by Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), a barmaid with a dodgy boyfriend, and by the mysterious Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Natalie is the classic femme fatale beloved of all such films!<br/><br/>So, the basic plot - the need to avenge a terrible crime - is not particularly original. But the memory issue is. That, however, pales into insignificance when set beside the highly unusual structure of the narrative of the film. Time appears to move backwards and forwards in chunks in almost equal measure in a complex presentation of the chronology of events that is sometimes difficult to follow. The viewer needs all his wits and attentive powers about him to work out exactly what is going on and when. There is the added complication of a seemingly unimportant sub-plot concerning someone whom Leonard was investigating for possible insurance fraud before his wife's demise and who was apparently suffering the same memory difficulties that now plague Leonard. <br/><br/>""Memento"" is an absorbing and entertaining film. It is beautifully acted by all concerned. Guy Pearce is superb as Leonard. He appears in virtually every scene in the film. His performance is such that the viewer cares about him and his crusade to avenge his wife's death. The film is well directed. And it is skilfully edited, something that is crucial to the plausibility of the plot, given the film's unusual structure. The problem is though that ""Memento"" is at times overrun by a sense of cleverness, knowingness and pretentiousness. I have no idea why, for instance, a number of crucial scenes (they usually involve Leonard on the telephone to an unidentified policeman who seems to be providing him with unreliable information) are filmed in monochrome. And while the reverse chronology of the film is unusual it does not really enhance what I think is one of the main messages of the film: which is that memory is a tantalisingly fragile aspect of human life, and that what and whom we trust are governed by all sorts of things beyond our control. So what we have here is an entertaining and fascinating film noir that, for all its technical accomplishment and wizardry, is just that: an enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable, movie. 6/10."
"kenjha","6","1","4","28 December 2010"," Muddled
","A man is determined to avenge the murder of his wife, but his mission is complicated by the fact that he suffers from short-term memory loss. The film is unique in that it tells the story backwards, starting at the end and moving to the beginning scene by scene. The purpose of this narrative device is to let the viewer experience what the protagonist is going through. It may have seemed like a clever idea on paper, but it makes for a muddled and unsatisfying film. The plot is preposterous and there are too many loose ends. Nolan seems more interested in propagating a gimmick than in telling a compelling story. It's not bad, but it's really not worth the trouble. Pearce is good."
"kosmasp","10","1","4","16 September 2010"," Have I seen you before?
","If you have watched the very first movie done by Mr. Nolan, than yes you have seen this before. Not exactly like this and with quite a few flaws, but if you consider that it was more or less a student film and seeing this, probably nothing more than an exercise on how to do it on a grand scale, than it was more than decent.<br/><br/>Nolan is one my new favorite directors and as the rating does show you here, I am not alone. Not that that will convince you he is better than you think he is. Actually you might even not like Memento, for one reason or another. There is people out there who just want to be entertained, when they go watch a movie. And that's not a bad thing. Nor does that mean that if someone likes, say Transformers 2 better than this movie, that he/she has no clue. It's just a matter of taste.<br/><br/>I for one, can tell you that this is a movie that merits watching it more than once. And the disc version offers you to watch the movie ... in a different ""order"", which gives you a new unique experience. If you haven't watched it yet, you are in for treat. And don't worry, if you don't understand everything the first time you watch it ..."
"hall895","10","1","4","2 May 2010"," Perfection
","This is why you watch movies. You watch hundreds upon hundreds of movies hoping to someday find a gem like Memento. This is, quite simply, the perfect movie.<br/><br/>The less said about the plot the better. Best to let you try to put this movie's puzzle together yourself. And what an ingeniously crafted puzzle it is. Anyone who saw this movie upon its initial release knew writer/director Christopher Nolan was a filmmaker destined to do great things. And we all know how that's turned out. Along with his brother Jonathan, writer of the original short story upon which the screenplay is based, Christopher Nolan here has crafted a story which seems impossibly complex but which is actually rather simple. It is the manner in which Nolan chooses to allow that simple story to unfold which is the genius of the film. The story is so engaging and so brilliantly put together that when the movie ends you desperately want to see it again. Immediately. You can't pay a movie any higher compliment than that.<br/><br/>Memento centers around the character of Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce in what is an absolutely stunning performance. Leonard is out for revenge, hunting down the man who murdered his wife. But Leonard's investigation is hampered, to say the least, by the injury he sustained on the night his wife was attacked. He has no short-term memory. He remembers everything up to the attack. But he can't make new memories. Everything fades away. If he meets someone he won't remember them minutes later. And Christopher Nolan ingeniously puts us right inside Leonard's head. How? By telling the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. So as we see events unfold we, like Leonard, do not know what has happened beforehand. The effect is downright brilliant. Leonard will be helped by two people in his quest for vengeance. First is the mysterious Teddy, played by Joe Pantoliano. Who is this guy and why is he helping Leonard? Because the movie begins at the end we know right away something is not right about Teddy. And you can't wait for the story to unravel itself to find out how we get to that end. Also providing assistance to Leonard is a bartender named Natalie, played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Much like Teddy it seems Natalie has her own motives for helping Leonard. Who is this woman and what exactly is she playing at? Part of the thrill of watching the film is finding the answers to those questions.<br/><br/>So there's the plot, a seemingly simple story told in a wonderfully unique way. Needless to say the story is not nearly as simple as it seems. There are so many twists and turns but best to let you discover those for yourself. It really is a perfectly constructed puzzle. Everything has to fit just so, any small mistakes anywhere along the way could have sunk the whole thing. There are no mistakes. It's perfect. There are really only three major roles and they're all performed wonderfully. Pantoliano and Moss are very good but Pearce is truly spectacular. What a challenging role to play and he pulls it off brilliantly. Great actors performing a great story...that's generally the formula for an exceptional film. And that is the case here. Memento was nominated for the Oscar for best screenplay. It lost to Gosford Park. Does anyone even remember Gosford Park? Nobody who sees Memento will ever forget it. This movie will live forever. You'll want to see it again and again and again. It is the perfect movie."

His purpose, to find the man he believes killed his wife. As you can imagine this is an almost impossible task in Leonards position. Along with this comes deception and betrayal. During the story leonard become somewhat friends with two other complex characters. Throughout the movie the other characters continually ask what's the point in finding this man that killed his wife if he won't be able to remember just a short time after. Leonard responds with it's the only thing that keeps him alive and gives him purpose after the short term memory loss. Not remembering every word and action these characters do leads to leonard being used. <br/><br/>There are two different perspectives in this movie. Colored and black and white. The colored scenes are of the present and the black and white are of leonard having a telephone conversation about a client he once had when he was an insurance investigator.

","In this puzzle box of an action mystery, Pearce plays a haunted, driven man with no idea how to proceed from the start of each day. It seems he has a short-term memory disorder, meaning he has to leave himself notes, Polaroids and other reminders just to figure out what it is he's doing. Chief among these reminders is a series of tattoos he's had made all over his body which display certain facts he needs to recall in order to figure out who it is who has killed his wife! The film, told in backwards fashion, interspersed with black and white, chronological, current footage of a phone conversation, depicts Pearce's struggle to remind himself of his mission and fulfill it while traveling backwards in order to let the audience find out what happened at the same time he does. Pearce is solid and arresting in the central role. An attempt seems to have been made to gear his appearance to that which resembles Brad Pitt for no apparent reason. Nonetheless, he creates a character compelling enough to warrant taking the journey through his damaged psyche. Other key players include Moss, as a battered cocktail waitress who becomes close to him and Pantoliano, a shifty pal who may not be everything he seems to be on the surface. Despite the unusual structure, which distorts time and sequence, the film is surprisingly easy to follow, though it obviously requires a certain amount of attention. Unfortunately, instead of building to a shattering climax, it begins to become somewhat tiresome and bothersome as it goes along, though the ending retains a certain degree of surprise and the craftsmanship of the film is strong. Perhaps the concept is a bit cumbersome in a feature length film and this idea would have worked better in a one-hour dramatic series or something similar. Still, it's got a significant number of fans and should appeal to those who like a challenge when watching movies versus being spoon fed the standard action fare."
"brando647","7","1","4","23 December 2007"," Great Mystery with a Unique Style
","Christopher Nolan has created a classic, and very unique, thriller. Based on the short story written by Nolan's brother, the movie follows Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man on the hunt for the person responsible for the rape and murder of his wife. The catch: Leonard suffers from anterograde amnesia, he is unable to create new memories. So to keep track of his investigation, he must take notes and pictures; in some cases, actually tattooing the facts onto his body. During his hunt, he must learn to distinguish between those who aim to help him, and those who aim to use him.<br/><br/>As you probably know, the real interesting aspect of this movie is that its events are told in reverse. The movie begins at the end of the story and works its way to the start. In doing this, Nolan keeps the audience in the same state as Leonard himself. Just as Leonard has no recollection of how he came to be where he is, neither does the person watching the movie. In editing the movie in this way, Nolan helps the audience sympathize with Leonard's situation and his constant confusion. Of course, this style is definitely not for everyone. In fact, a good chunk of the people I've shown this movie to can't stand it for that very reason. They become too confused and can't follow the story, so they give up and walk away. Oh well, in my opinion, it's their loss. I personally thought it made the movie that much better, almost placing the viewer in Leonard's scenario. And despite the fact the movie starts at the end, there are still a couple twists the audience may not see coming.<br/><br/>The story, while seemingly a simple concept, is fantastic (and definitely complex). The characters are shady and you never know who to trust. Joe Pantoliano plays Teddy, a cop who has been helping Leonard in his search, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays a waitress who agrees to help Leonard but may have a deeper connection to the situation. Without knowledge of prior events, like the protagonist, the audience is left suspicious of everyone Leonard encounters.<br/><br/>Despite the many haters of this film out there, I think everyone should give this movie a chance. It may be a bit confusing at times, but it all pays off by the time you've figured it out."
"dschoenike","10","1","4","6 December 2007"," the best film I've ever seen.
","I'd first like to acknowledge all the outstanding reviews and discussions of Memento written by IMDb users and visitors. I'm not a good enough writer to add anything original or thought provoking that hasn't been said before. What i will write about, are some aspects of Memento that make it such a wonderful film. The attention to detail; Memento practically demands that you watch it a handful of times at a minimum. I firmly believe that any little mistake or oversight would have been greatly magnified, due to the fact this films whole premise is paying attention to facts and details. Even when you think you've discovered a plot-hole, or a situation that doesn't make sense, you have to realize thats's the genius of the film. You're viewing the film the way Leonard is going through life. Where you/he cannot be sure of anything, and there's a fine line between facts and perception. The outstanding acting; I think i've read that Brad Pitt and Alec Baldwin were asked to play the part of Leonard Shelby. It's my opinion, that Guy Pearce is the most underrated actor working today. His portrayal of a normal man living through extraordinary circumstances was nothing short of phenomenal. His ability to hold the viewers attention on his every word and action, really made this film work. Joe Pantoliano was great as Teddy, a guy who was maybe helping Lenny, or just taking advantage of him. Or both? The musical score; Composed and performed by David Julyan, the music is chilling and beautiful. It seemed to me like the music was itself a separate character in the film, with its ability to grab the viewers attention and bring about ranges of emotion. And lastly, the director; Christopher Nolan, in my opinion, has made nothing but excellent films. Not a bad one in the bunch. I think that Memento with a lesser skilled director, would have been an above average movie. But not the mind-bending masterpiece Mr. Nolan gave to us in 2001. Memento is a rare film that requires your full attention, (a few times at minimum) that'll have you thinking about it long after you've viewed it. To me, its a movie that in 20+ years, people will say, ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"". Now, where was I? ;)"
"rboothe","10","1","4","1 December 2007"," DSM-IV Diagnosis of Leonard's Mental Condition
","The Limited Edition DVD Set of Memento released in 2002 includes a sheet of paper in the box with a blank space labeled ""diagnosis"". It seems that the director is literally inviting us to make a diagnosis of Leonard. I intend to do that here, but doing so will necessitate revealing some spoilers, so be forewarned before reading further. I only have room here for a brief synopsis. For a fuller treatment, see the commentary about Memento at my blogsite (rboothe.wordpress.com).<br/><br/>The DSM-IV is the standard reference manual used by psychiatrists and psychologists when diagnosing a mental disorder. One of the diagnostic conditions listed in the DSM-IV is amnesia, a cognitive disorder secondary to brain injury or trauma. Can we fit Leonard into this diagnostic category? The short answer is no! Let me elaborate.<br/><br/>Consider first, the relationship between Leonard and Sammy. The character Sammy is either Leonard's alter ego, or was someone Leonard once met whose persona he has tried to assume as his own. Most of what Leonard tells us about Sammy during the film is actually a description of Leonard (himself). We know that Leonard himself went by the name ""Sammy"" sometimes, as evidenced in the scene where the character Jimmy is dying and calls out, ""Sammy"", towards his murderer, Leonard. The character Teddy informs us that ""Sammy"" did not have a wife, and that all of Leonard's stories about ""Sammy's wife"" having diabetes were really stories about Leonard's wife. Finally, the director threw in an even more explicit clue in the form of a flashback. In the scene where Leonard is discussing how ""Sammy"" was committed to a mental institution, we are shown flashback in which we see ""Sammy"" sitting in the hospital. At the very end of the flashback, the director inserts a few frames in which the person in the mental hospital is actually Leonard.<br/><br/>There are several lines of evidence that ""Sammy"" did not really have amnesia. Leonard tells us that, in his role as insurance investigator, he concluded there was ""no physical reason that should prevent Sammy from making new memories"". We are also told that ""Sammy's wife"" was skeptical about whether or not he really had memory loss. Finally, we are told that the doctors who examined ""Sammy"" were skeptical about his memory loss.<br/><br/>Lets tentatively conclude that since ""Sammy"" probably did not really have amnesia, that means Leonard did not have amnesia. If that tentative conclusion is correct, we can expect that the director must have provided a clue  Some example where Leonard messed up and revealed some fact that he could not have known if he really had amnesia. This clue shows up in the critical scene where Leonard refers to the motel manager, Burt, by name. As an amusing aside, I would like to mention that the IMDb site for Memento lists this as ""a goof in continuity"". However, this is a ""goof "", as opposed to a ""clue"", only if one presupposes that Leonard really had amnesia! So, if the evidence does not allow us to diagnose Leonard with the condition of amnesia, what mental condition did he have? Lets consider another diagnostic condition described in the DSM-IV, Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD). In layman's terms, individuals diagnosed with APD are often called psychopaths. They lack empathy for the pain and suffering of others, and are able to inflict physical and emotional pain without feeling any remorse. These individuals also enjoy playing elaborate con games, often simply for thrills rather than for personal gain.<br/><br/>Lets consider the possibility that Leonard was a psychopath who was playing an elaborate game in which he pretended to have anterograde memory loss. Perhaps he had actually once known someone named Sammy who had the condition. Or perhaps he just heard about the condition somewhere, became intrigued by it, and went to the library to study up about it. Either way, he decided to initiate an elaborate game where, in every situation in which he found himself, he imagined what a person with this form of amnesia would do, and then acted in the same way. He played this game to the limit, regardless of where it led, including if it required him to drink other peoples spit, or hurt or kill other individuals, including his own wife.<br/><br/>What evidence in the film supports this possibility? Consider a key diagnostic feature of individuals with APD, as specified in DSM-IV. They do not exhibit normal fear responses, and as a result have trouble learning to alter their behavior based on punishment. For example, if a normal person were given an electric shock each time he chose a triangle over a square on a psychological test, that person would quickly learn to choose the square instead of the triangle on subsequent tests. A person with APD would have trouble learning this task. Does this test sound familiar? It was the test failed by the character ""Sammy"", and that led to ""Sammy's"" diagnosis and subsequent commitment to a mental hospital.<br/><br/>Is there any direct evidence for this diagnostic trait in Leonard? There is a scene early in the film where Leonard runs into the glass at the entry door of the motel where he has been staying. Ouch! He does this because the door opens outward but he tries to push on it. A ""normal"" individual might do this once, or perhaps twice, but then quickly learn to alter his behavior so as to avoid continuing to be punished. An individual with APD would take much longer. At this point in the story, Leonard has been staying at this same motel for at least days, possibly weeks. Bingo! I think I have my diagnosis."

","Poor guy, first he killed a man, and then he doesn't know it any more. When you see the film you have to think and think, to really understand, and you have to connect the single parts. This is going on there but where is it? And there is a new person but where did she came from?  Just wait for the next scene. That's the trick of the film.<br/><br/>And there are the scenes in black and white. First they didn't make sense for me but in the end I noticed that they tell the case history in the correct order.<br/><br/>But I was really confused in the end. For me it doesn't fit anywhere. OK, I have to confess: wikipedia is also a good help.<br/><br/>I really have to say: It's a brilliant and intelligent film but I think that seeing again wouldn't be a mistake.<br/><br/>After the film you sit there and see the final credits but in your mind you are thinking about the film and what happened... happened before, happened after and happened right in the middle.<br/><br/>I really like such films because after them you have to think about them a lot. They're not that easy so you have to listen and see attentively. Memento is only one of a couple of very good films by Christopher Nolan, though I didn't like 'Batman Begins'. So let's look at 'The Dark Knight'. Maybe this Batman film can convince me."

","Brilliant modern ""film noir"" of a man suffering from a rare form of memory loss trying to figure out a murder. The unusual structure of this film still has me puzzled, but in a most posititive way. The acting is excellent in a low key way, and the atmosphere- mostly set in a cheap motel and restaurant all contribute something to the story. In fact they almost seem like players themselves.The shoestring budget only adds to the realism. Brilliant use and distortion of time seem to capture the thoughts going through the mind of the hero as he tries to figure out exactly what has happened.Also excellent and noteworthy are the transitions from black and white to color.This is not a movie for the short attention span crowd. You will have to see it at least twice to figure it out, but the resulting experience will be one that is hard to forget.Compare that to the hard sell, high concept films currently littering the multiplexes. A rare treat, especially for film buffs."

Many are blinded by its structure and don't therefore see properly. There is more, though; that's undeniable.<br/><br/>Once the novelty has worn off, which is inevitable if you've seen more than fifty films, Nolan is clever enough to speed it up a little.

","Leonard Shelby suffers short-term memory loss. He remember only everything up to the day his wife was raped and murdered. With this handicap, his quest to seek revenge and take the life of the criminal, becomes so difficult that he must rely on Polaroid photographs and tattoos to inform him of his progress each time his memory is wiped. He suffers greatly as he fails to find anyone he can trust and begins to lose faith in himself.<br/><br/>Memento is an absolute first of its kinds. The story is told in reverse and every scene came after the next. The events being told backwards is not a disadvantage as it only gives the viewers an opportunity to know only what Leonard knows. The feature successfully avoids dramatic irony and therefore displays a more personal approach with regards to what angle audience is intended to see it from.<br/><br/>This movie shows Guy Pearce at his best. His voice is serious and his acting is of incredible quality. The scenes begin and end in all the right places.<br/><br/>This is not the film to see if you feel like a light viewing. The pure complexity and intense story is enough to require much concentration from its viewers. If you do plan to sit through the experience, I can assure to the vast majority, it will be extremely enjoyable."
"slokes","7","1","4","4 December 2003"," Memorable doesn't always equal great
","Many movie lovers call this a 21st-century return to film noir, and I guess it is. It's a clever, even admirable film in the way it is constructed. Pardon me for not enjoying it more.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce stars as Leonard (don't call him Lenny) Shelby, a fellow hot on the trail of his wife's killer...if only he can remember more than five minutes ago. It's an intriguing concept, to what extent personality and identity are beholden to the brain's ability to make new memories, and you have to give mad props to the filmmakers for dreaming this one up, only they didn't bother to create any sympathetic characters for their drama, or a story worth caring about beyond the novel ""story-backwards-through-unfolding-plotting"" means of narration. You have to watch the movie more than once, perhaps several times, before you begin to realize what happened. But when you do, it feels like a cheat, because without the gimmick of the constant memory-lapses, the story itself isn't the sort that would hold you very long.<br/><br/>All the acting in this film is quite good, in a soulless '90s way. Pearce seems to have borrowed some voice inflections from `L.A. Confidential' co-star Kevin Spacey. He makes for a good anti-hero in many ways, playing his emotions down rather than up, a good choice that makes him a more compelling cypher. His short-term memory loss doesn't seem to have affected his workout regimen, however, nor his hair-treatment routine. But you shouldn't try penalizing movies for small logic lapses, if the movie makes you think hard enough about it after for you to figure out those lapses.<br/><br/>The always superb Joe Pantoliano is especially interesting as Teddy Gammell, a sort of helpful or not character who may or may not be a cop, and knows something about the man who killed Lenny's wife, or else maybe killed her himself. He's amusing, anyway, though not always comprehendible in his motives, either before or after you've seen it a few times. Still, a plus. So is Matrix hottie Carrie-Anne Moss, another possible helper or bad guy. Like Gammell, her character Natalie is no easy read, even after repeat viewings, and much of the fun in watching `Momento' again is trying to guess at what's going on inside her head in a given moment. She should keep the sunglasses on, though. Those cold pale blues of hers give me the creeps.<br/><br/>A lot to give away here, and I won't do it, even if the backwards-narrative makes such reticence impossible in reviewing the movie. The film plays off so many angles so well you can't help but admire the ride, or not want to spoil it, however much you may or may not actually enjoy it. Suffice to say it's as clever as everyone tells you, but you may not come away liking the bottom-line story as much as you thought. The mystery is hardly that involving (think ""Law And Order Special Victims Unit"" if you were watching it on drugs), the characters interesting but nobody you'd care enough to light a ciggie for let alone spend time with, and the final resolution as nihilistic as anything outside a Beckett play.<br/><br/>""Memory's not perfect,"" Leonard notes. ""It's not even that good."" Especially his, though he still seems able to spring a few traps. If only I cared more about them, or him. Good last line, though, one of the best, right up there with ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" and ""Tomorrow is another day."" (Which isn't far off point, come to think of it.)<br/><br/>Yes it's very good. No, it's not great. It's not in my top 200, let alone top 20. But if you meet Natalie at the bar, be sure not to tell her Jimmy Grantz sent you."

","""Maybe you've got an idea of what you want to do but can't remember what you just did."" These days there aren't many thrillers that have the balls to be different. With the exception of the masterpiece Mulholland Drive and The Salton Sea most thrillers are pretty standard. Mostly the story line involves a protagonist who is searching for a faceless antagonist because they have committed a crime or for other personal reasons. That said I have just described the story behind Memento. Now just hear me out because I am anything but a hypocrite. Leonard is trying to hunt down the person who raped and murdered his wife. During his investigated two people fade in and out of his mind (Teddy and Natalie) faster than he can even process. Neither of them clam to know the other but they sure seem to know a lot about each other, both are also very suspicious characters in a world where no one can be trusted. But this film has one twist that will make this film genius to some and unbearable to others. The twist is that Leonard has a ""condition"" that allows him to remember everything up to the death of his wife but can't create any new memories. It is like every time Leonard opens his eyes a whole new world has been crated around him. He knows who he is but not what he has become. He knows what he is doing but not whom he is doing it for. Now you are probably wondering how a simple characteristic like short-term memory loss makes a film unbearable to some. This is where director Christopher Nolan comes into play. Nolan has decided to take a simple concept and tell it in one of the most original fashions I have seen in a film noir. He allows the entire film to unfold backwards! We open the film with a scene showing Leonard killing the man he thinks responsible for the death of his wife. We then move back in time to see how he came to the opening scene (the ending). Instead of giving the audience a situation and letting them figure out the mystery, Nolan has give us the conclusion and the basic story elements and lets the audience figure out if Leonard's actions are justified. Another interesting concept is that whenever a scene ends by meeting where the previous one started we cut to a black and white scene showing Leonard in an anonymous room, taking an anonymous phone call. He tells the caller of his days when he had to investigate a man named Sammy Jankis who suffered from the same condition as him. This is where the film gets tricky. See the black and white scenes provide a means of characterization and basic insight into what is, has and will happen to Leonard in colour. It also lets us understand Leonard's condition more thoroughly to strengthen the plot immensely with the audience even knowing. The thing that makes these scenes tricky is that while the one in colour run backwards, the black and white ones run forward in time until the finally meet at the end to provide a whole new light on everything. This is a very impressive piece of work for a first time director such as Nolan who also wrote the script. He makes everything seem visually stunning without the use of any special effects or trickery. He also creates a world where everything said and done is significant to the films outcome. If you don't pay attention to something because you think it isn't important or is boring than you may as well stop watching because everything that the eye can see is important to take in. Nolan also keeps everything thought provoking and edgy at all times. There is not one moment in this film that allows you to stop thinking and take a break. Nolan hardly gives you enough time to even blink and even the lighter scenes in the film have an eerily suspenseful ness to them. There are also some bits of dark humour thrown in but instead of being a break from the tension they only maximize it. To me this humour came off as a dead irony and just helped build onto Leonard's character. Both Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano give great performances as Teddy and Natalie but it is Guy Pearce as Leonard who gives a career making performance. Never once did he allow anyone to forget about his condition and rely simply on the story because this character is the story that he doesn't know he is telling and working in the world that he doesn't know he is living in. In fact this character is the centre of the universe in this film. Everything revolves around him. He is more than just a character; he is a reminder of reality because if you don't remember what order the scenes come in then you will not understand this film at all. What better way is there to feel like your living in a characters shoes than that? Pearce does a fabulous job of keeping everything in tact and getting off his character as likeable but still a very real person. It is nice to know that when David Lynch is gone there will still be someone who isn't afraid to make a film that doesn't merely focus on the story but more on how the audience interprets it."

","When the first scene of the film began, I knew I wasn't watching your average movie. After reading so many good reviews, and hearing here or there about this movie, I became really interested in it. I was expecting one of the greatest movies of the decade, it was pretty good, but it is highly overrated. The idea of starting backwards it very interesting, but it becomes predictable very soon. The characters are very two-dimensional, the cinematography it's very average. The only innovative aspect it's the script, wich has very big flaws...<br/><br/>For example, when Leonard says that the police doesn't believe him, how could he remember? And how does he remember that he writes down everything on photos and tatoos? And that he is seeking the murderer of his wife? He would have to read A LOT to know what he did since the murdering of his wife.<br/><br/>Overrall, it's an entertaining movie, if you consider that this is the best movie of all time, maybe that's because you haven't watched The Godfather or Citizen Kane. If you want something better from the same year (2000), try the mexican movie ""Amores Perros"" (wrongfully translated ""Love's a bitch"")."

Put it this way, my kids had to wait until 9 o'clock at night to eat dinner because I refused to get up from this flick :^)  By the time the last half hour of the movie was wrapping up I was literally glued to my seat.  Bathroom breaks be damned, I cannot remember the last time my jaw dropped at the end of a movie due to the fact that I had absolutely no idea what the end was going to be.  I loved it!!  I sat in stunned silence for a few minutes gleefully replaying the events of the movie in my mind.<br/><br/>This definitely pushed past ""Pulp Fiction"" as my top ""I wanna see this over and over again"" movie.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is the only movie that I can even think of to ""compare"" to this movie and that's not even fair because ""Pulp Fiction"" was cool because it was a normally sequenced movie that was basically rearranged out of sequence just to f*ck with your head, and we loved it.  We know what's going on in ""PF"", it's just all scrambled up. Well ""Memento"" is out of sequence, totally backwards, because of Leonard Shelby's lack of short term memory.  We (and Leonard) have to relive each step of his life through the use of Polaroid pictures and the ever present Teddy (the wonderful Joe Pantoliano).  Guy Pearce (Leonard Shelby), who was superb in ""L.A. Confidential,"" could have just traipsed, befuddled, through his trek and made this a drag, but instead I was as anxious as he was to bring himself some closure.  This could have just been a run of the mill whodunit that relied on flashbacks.  Instead we are guessing, guessing, guessing and then boom! we are hit with the end and blown away.<br/><br/>If you like a great psychological thriller, this takes it light-years past what you would normally expect.  Set aside two hours, unplug the phone, make sure all pets/kids/spouses are fed, extinguish all smoking materials, and prepare to be riveted.....and perhaps Christopher Nolan did this on purpose (and did it so well), the irony is, Leonard Shelby has to go over and over the same things, repeating himself, having information repeated to him, but I want to see this movie again, so does that mean that we are stuck in Leonard's endless loop of a life once we see this movie?

","Guy Pearce stars as a strange character who is trying to find his wife's killer in this innovative, smart and amazingly well-thought-out movie that switches back and forth between real time and stunning flashbacks. Pearce has a rare form of amnesia which keeps him from developing new memories. Thus he ""goes blank"" every 10 minutes and this naturally makes catching his wife's killer near impossible so he must keep notes, take pictures and even tattoo himself to keep all the clues fresh in his mind. There is the suspicious Joe Pantoliano who could be the man that Pearce is looking for and the seductive but shady Carrie-Anne Moss who may have alterior motives of her own. Pearce thinks back to before his wife's murder and tries to put his illness in perspective as he has experience with another individual who had the same problem when Pearce was an insurance investigator. The film starts, stops and pauses throughout its running time by showing something happening and then showing what happened leading up to the event. It is all a jigsaw puzzle that will make sense in the end. Co-writer/director Christopher Nolan has truly created a film that is unique, innovative and overall brilliant. 5 stars out of 5."

","I rented Memento tonight after many of my friends raved over it. Trusting their judgment, I gave it a go.<br/><br/>It was exactly what I expected it to be: ground-breaking in screenplay and not overly ""arthousey"". It doesn't scream, ""I'm an iconoclast!"". It's genuine. It's intriguing.<br/><br/>Guy Pierce plays Leonard Shelby, the high-cheekboned main character who suffers from ""a condition""--that condition being he has no short-term memory. He describes it as constantly ""waking up"" from the night his wife was murdered--which is the last long-term event he can recall. Now, he pursues to seek revenge against the killer, tattooing himself and writing notes so that he won't forget the clues along the way.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so gripping is the fact that the story is told backwards! The effect is so that we somehow are placed into Leonard's shoes, not knowing what he's doing or why he's relating with a certain character until we recall what happened earlier. The result is twists and turns--endless surprises. You never know who is ""good"" or ""bad."" It's not your traditional feel-good movie, now, is it? Writer-Director Christopher Nolan is a genius; the broad scope of his imagination is clearly evident in this film. We're never left with a ""boring"" scene; instead, the two hours just fly by because you're so immersed with what's going on--and wringing your hands over what will happen next.<br/><br/>Expect to be confused... expect to think. Memento is a must-see for serious drama-seeking movie-goers, not those who are willing to shell out $12 at theatres to watch some commercially over-rated air-head fluff and eyecandy graphics that has become the norm in Hollywood. Ugh. I'm sorry, but that's not my idea of ""entertainment.""<br/><br/>I'm glad that there's still people out there willing to make such an excellent film such as this, without going overboard on advertising it.

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","4","6 April 2002"," Memento is the most creatively made and brilliantly engaging film of at least the last decade.
","SPOILER ALERT First of all, I would like to point out that I am a huge fan of Roger Ebert. His reviews are well written and enlightening about the movies that they focus on and often a lot of obscure movies that are related to the one in question, but his review of Memento is one of the most ignorant and just flat-out incorrect pieces of film criticism that I have ever read. Sure, there's a hole in the plot. If the last thing that Leonard remembers is his wife dying, then he should not technically remember that he can't form short term memories. Plot hole, yes. But who cares?! Anyone? Anyone? Me neither. Plot holes plague the Back to the Future series, one of the most entertaining trilogies ever made, left and right. In Part II, Marty McFly leaves 1985 to travel to the year 2015 to prevent his teenage son from robbing a bank and getting thrown in jail and starting that horrible chain reaction that destroys his entire family. In his review of that film, Ebert seems to have overlooked the MASSIVE plot hole that far overshadows the one that he points out in Memento  if Marty leaves 1985 and travels to 2015, there is no longer any Marty left in 1985 to grow into the 47-year-old Marty that he finds in 2015. This little revelation suggests that Ebert is either judging films on varying and unstable criteria, or he has something against someone involved in the making of Memento.<br/><br/>Regardless of what Ebert says, Memento is an absolutely brilliant film that engages the viewer and literally brings him or her into the mind of the main character. Ebert naively points out that the reverse plotline of the film has nothing to do with Leonard's condition, which is arguably the most foolish thing that he says in his review. Ebert has made what may be called the idiotic assumption that the reverse plotline represents the way that Leonard lives. I am finding it difficult to determine how he has managed to come to that conclusion without inserting plotlines of his own into the film, such as ones involving time travel or some other such science fiction nonsense. Memento is a dramatic thriller about a man with a severe psychological memory disorder, and the reverse plotline is there to put the audience in Leonard's shoes. He has no idea what happened before what he's doing right now, and neither do we. Are you hearing this, Roger? I suggest you watch this movie again, because you missed a LOT.<br/><br/>(spoilers) Another gigantic element of the plot that Ebert seems to have missed (BOTH times he saw the film), is the fact that Leonard's wife was never raped, and never killed. There is a single shot near the end of the film (I warn again, there are spoilers ahead!) that is not more than a few seconds long, that proves that she was never killed (I suppose rape is still a possibility), and also eradicates the plot hole that Ebert pointed out, that Leonard should not be able to remember his `condition' if the last thing that he remembers is his wife being killed. The shot that I am talking about is one in which Leonard is laying in bed, and his wife is laying next to him with her head on his shoulder, running her fingers over the tattoo across his chest that says `John G. raped and murdered my wife.' Are you hearing THIS, Roger? One viewing, contrary to what Ebert foolishly suggested in his review, is NOT enough for this film. Memento is one of the few films that not only invites repeat viewings, but requires them.<br/><br/>Confusion is not the state to be in here, not by any stretch of the imagination. Repeat viewings will remove you from that state and put you in a state of blissful enlightenment as you realize the astonishing intricacy of this film. The poignant back story about Sammy Jankis and his wife is not only powerful and moving, but relates DIRECTLY to Loenard's condition, which is yet another thing that Ebert has amazingly managed to completely miss. In Ebert's defense (because I do not intend this review of my own to be a knock against one of my otherwise favorite film critics), I can only say that maybe he latched onto some erroneous idea the first time he saw the film that clouded his cinematic vision the second time he saw it, or perhaps he was simply viewing it from the wrong perspective. I invite you all to read his review but also note that there are maybe half a dozen or so things that he says in that review that are simply wrong, and this can be easily seen just by watching this incredible film. Roger, I love your work, and I have all of your books, but in this case, it seems that YOU may be the one with the condition!'"

","This movie came as a huge surprise on me in a very positive way. Once in a while there are screenwriters and/or directors who really want to do something extraordinary to impress the viewers of their production. As an example, Groundhog Day had the main character relive the same day over and over again for ages until he finally got the girl of his dreams in the end, and it worked. Fight Club also gave you an intense story where two very different characters slowly evolved to a movie climax rarely seen, because to most people the answer to all the story's conflicts is to unimaginable. A closer example to ""Memento"" is ""The Usual Suspects"" from 1994, which gave you a very exciting story set in the criminal underworld run by Kayzer Zose, a man everybody fears but no one knows who he is...a lot like the main character in ""Memento.""<br/><br/>The story is about insurance investigator Leonard, who suffers from short-term memory loss. Leonard got injured after intervening on his wife's murder. The murderer was still there when Leonard walked in on them, thus the main character ended up with a cracked skull (figuratively speaking).<br/><br/>The movie's opening scene is where most crime stories would end; the main character gets his wife's murderer. The rest of the movie is built upon the fragments of memories that led Leonard getting his guy, in other words this movie is kind of told backwards, starting from the mentioned opening scene and ending where the whole situation actually begun... sound confusing? Well, I was confused for about fifteen minutes but once I understood what was going on the rest was just pure genius. At one point I asked myself: ""How can a story told backwards actually get more exciting by the minute?"" As much as I would give you some information about this, you really have to see the movie for yourself to actually understand what a gem this really is. The tension curve is always rising, with an ending so surprisingly good that this movie is up there with stunners like aforementioned ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Fight Club.""<br/><br/>This is a totally unmissable movie for lovers of the crime/mystery genre."

","Written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception), I had seen this film a couple of times before, but apart from the obvious bits and pieces of it I could not remember everything that happens, so I watched again to be sure of my opinion. Basically the film starts with the reverse of Leonard ""Lenny"" Shelby (Guy Pearce) shooting dead John Edward ""Teddy"" Gammell (Joe Pantoliano), which would be the end of the film, this is followed by scenes in black and white and in colour, the black and white sequences take place chronologically. Leonard is in a motel room talking to an unnamed and unseen telephone caller, Leonard has anterograde amnesia and cannot form new memories, the result of an attack following the rape and murder of his wife (Jorja Fox), his last permanent memory, besides who he is. He recalls from that night that there were two men, Leonard believes the second attacker's name is John (or possibly James), with a last name starting with G, Leonard conducts his own investigation to find this man, using a system of notes, Polaroid photos and tattoos. As an insurance investigator, Leonard recalls one Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), also diagnosed with the same form of amnesia, Sammy's diabetic wife (Harriet Sansom Harris) was not sure if his condition was genuine, repeating acts to see if he would realise, he did not and as a result of his repeated requests for insulin injections she fell into a coma and died. The colour sequences are shown in reverse chronological order, picking up from a particular recognisable moment, Leonard gets tattoos detailing the licence of John G, using his notes he meets bartender Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), she resents him as he wears and drives the car of her boyfriend Jimmy Grantz (Larry Holden). She does use his condition to her advantage in moments, but understanding his situation she gets Leonard to drive a man named Dodd (Callum Keith Rennie) out of town, and in doing so she agrees to run the licence plate to help his investigation. Leonard meanwhile meets contact Teddy, he helps him with Dodd, Teddy warns him about Natalie, but Leonard left himself a note not to believe Teddy's lies, Natalie provides Leonard the driver's licence of a John Edward Gammell, Teddy's full name, he believes he has found ""John G"", and he lures Teddy to an abandoned building to kill him, as seen at the beginning. But the final black and white scene reveals that the unseen caller was in fact Teddy, he is an undercover officer and has found ""John G"", Natalie's boyfriend, Jimmy Grantz, at the same abandoned building Jimmy arrives, Leonard strangles him and takes a photo of his body, as it develops the black and white transitions to colour, thus beginning the colour sequences and meeting in the middle of the story. Leonard swaps clothes with Jimmy, who before dying whispers the name ""Sammy"", he has only told those he has met about Sammy, he doubts Jimmy is the attacker, but Teddy tells him that he in fact killed the man who killed his wife a year ago, he helped Leonard find him, Teddy tells him ""John G"" is a common name, he will end up going in circles with his amnesia, he remarks he is a ""John G"" himself. In the end, after hearing Teddy explain everything, Leonard makes the drastic decision to burn the photographs of Jimmy, and writes down the licence plate of Teddy's car to be tattooed on himself as a ""fact"", he will then assume that Teddy is the second attacker he is looking for, this leads to all the events concluding with Teddy's death. Also starring Mark Boone Junior as Burt and Russ Fega as Waiter. The performances of Pearce, Pantoliano and Moss are all good, you could argue that the story is nothing spectacular, but it is made that way because of the really clever editing, going backwards and forwards, this also emphasises the serious amnesia of the leading character, it is a film you really have to focus on while watching, and it may be a little complicated as you gather the facts, but it really tests your sense of reality, a most worthwhile thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Editing (losing to Black Hawk Down) and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!"

","In Los Angeles an insurance agent (Guy Pearce) with the inability to form short-term memories attempts to avenge the rape and murder of his wife.<br/><br/>Memento was an astonishingly ambitious feature for young British director Christopher Nolan to undertake as his first American production, attempting - at the end of the films' first century - to rewrite the rules of narrative cinema in some way: much of what we see takes place in reverse, as dictated by the hero's condition. That it succeeds in not only being comprehensible - thanks to bold, indelible performances - but a resonant musing on identity makes the film even more astounding. Hugely influential among aspiring screenwriters, this is a film that demands fullest attention. Memento is number 173 on Empire magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time."
"vovazhd","9","1","5","29 September 2007"," Incredible Achievement
","Memento is a fresh breath compared to most mainstream movies. The main character is an amnesiac investigator searching for the killer of his wife. He utilizes tattoos and notes to follow a trail of evidence, even when he can't remember how he gained the evidence. The plot has enough twists and turns and surprise endings to be part of an amusement park. Just when you think your getting a hold of what is going on, everything swings into another direction. The reverse chronology of the main plot line makes things interesting to say the least.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce does a convincing portrayal of Leonard (the amnesiac), and pretty much all the other actors are fitting in their respective parts. The music is excellent and used very effectively. The individual segments (roughly 5 minutes each) are well executed. There is even some well-placed humor thrown in.<br/><br/>The flaw that prevents me from awarding Memento a 10 is also its main strength: the plot. While the plot is excellently crafted and executed, it is just too convoluted. Maybe thats partly because of the reverse chronology, but it feels really unstable and is hard to follow at times. The complexity adds a lot to the meaning as a whole, but prevents casual viewing.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is essential viewing. The material is of the highest quality and the subject is fascinating. So many questions are spawned about the uses and abuses of amnesia, and just memory in general. It is one of those films that your going to think about all the time."
"Krazykopper","10","1","5","23 December 2004"," Unforgettable
","Undoubtedly the most astounding piece of work Hollywood had produced in decades. If Hitchcock was around today even he would surely bow to this movie's understated genius. What is undeniable here is the urge to keep watching. From the start you are shown the plot's climax, but to make sense of it you are pushed into rewind, slowly absorbing the plot, only understanding fully the end (or the beginning), by enduring long enough to finally see the revelations laid down at the beginning (or the end). Anyone who has watched the Easter egg chronological order of this on DVD will know it is not the plot but the reverse telling of the story in which the genius lies. This is a film that doesn't just entertain through its runtime , it will keep you enthralled for days as the outstanding plot reveals more and more with closer scrutiny through 'dare I say it', your own attempt to piece it together through memory. The little known Chris Nolan has outdone himself with this marvel and although his subsequent effort 'Insomnia' failed to make quite the same impression it will be interesting to see what he makes of the much anticipated 'Batman Begins'. A shrewd movie lining up Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano fresh from their success in the original Matrix movie. It is the performance of Guy Pearce 'LA Confidential & Neighbours (sorry Guy had to mention it)' that is enthralling. The audience insight through him into the complex life of a man with no memory is mesmerising. Many films which gradually unveil a series of complicated twists fall down upon subsequent viewing, but this delivers time and time again. In a time when originality is the greatest gift that a talented film maker can give us, this is without doubt the best example of a gripping original film ever made. It is just a shame that such original, independent films go unrecognised by the academy.<br/><br/>Don't dare miss this 10-10"

","Memento is a brilliantly conceived Chinese box puzzle of a movie. It tells of Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) who, due to a brain injury, is unable to form new long-term memories. Every time he wakes up he has to rediscover his life and his quest, based on notes, photographs, and tattoos he has created for the purpose. The movie starts at the end and works backwards--most scenes begin with Leonard gathering the threads of his life together. The next scene then shows how he got to the beginning of the last scene. It's an unsettling technique, but it is also a marvelous idea, because it puts the viewer in a similar situation to that of Leonard. When he wakes up, he doesn't know where he is, and we don't, either. This is a unique conception, and it makes a movie not to be missed. Unfortunately, it is also rather unsavory, full of violence and murder; but it also comes to a piquant and satisfying conclusion. It's only later that one begins to pick apart the logic. Not for all tastes, and some viewers will start completely lost and never figure out what the heck is going on. But for those up to its challenges, Memento is a unique viewing experience."

","I watched this right after I woke up so I was still in a trance. This turned out to be one of the most intriguing films I have seen in a while. It kind of reminded me of a good Twilight Zone episode. You pretty much figure out the guy has a memory problem. That's a main vehicle in the plot line. But here you have the added plus of experiencing the sensation because the film is edited in such a way as to disorient you. And yet, you don't really lose track of what is going on. (I don't think) <br/><br/>There isn't much action here. Very low key in most respects. This is just a real good mystery that doesn't really resolve itself. (I don't think) But this isn't disappointing. Lots of twists keeps you off balance and then - it's over.<br/><br/>I liked it so much I arranged to watch it again that same evening. Even though you know what's going to happen you begin to pickup an amazing amount of information that you missed the first time. This only made it better the second time. I'll see it a few more times - then maybe I'll catch everything. <br/><br/>The acting is convincing. The background music is adequate and unobtrusive.<br/><br/>Bottomline: Yeah, it's slow, but I think it's very well-written and put together. Every film student should see this. I give it an 8."
"bobgomez34","Null","1","5","19 September 2004"," Latest review of 'Memento'
","I found the idea of seeing a movie in reverse to be, if not unique, certainly rare. However, I don't think the movie works very well when studied closely. Guy Pierce's acting was almost non-existent. If, as he says, his last memory is of his wife dying, why does he never cry? He should be devastated by grief. (Mel Gibson in the first Lethal Weapon is in mourning and weeping openly 6 months after the death of his wife.) The plot device of short-term memory is a dicey tool to use anyway. This film is quite inconsistent with how long it takes to lose fresh memories. When Carrie-Ann Moss passes around his beer to be spit in and then gives it back to him, less than 30 seconds pass. No one could function with a condition like this!! When driving in a car, he wouldn't know if he was going to meet somebody 10 blocks away or be heading out of town to follow a new lead!<br/><br/>Carrie-Ann Moss' acting is equally bad. Or is her character just completely indifferent toward her boyfriend, even though the script tells us she is very close to him? The first time we see her, she sees Lenny, a complete stranger, pull up in her boyfriend's car, wearing her boyfriend's clothes! Is she upset, is she heartbroken, is she scared? None of the above. (Meryl Streep would certainly have handled that differently!)<br/><br/>As to Joe Pantoliano's character, we remains a mystery from start to finish. ""Don't believe his lies"". We are told this FIVE times. Yet the possibility that Lenny himself committed the murder is introduced. A friend of mine at work is convinced that Lenny DID kill his own wife. If he duped and killed the man that the police found dead in their apartment, the day his wife was killed, then who slammed his head into the mirror giving him the amnesia? Or are we expected to believe that two uninvolved criminals just happened to break in, the very night he murders his wife? Sure is overly convenient, plus the odds are astronomical!!<br/><br/>I have nothing against movies that send a sad or discouraging message about life. But, a mystery works best when by the end, the mystery is solved. Requiring the audience to watch the movie a second or even a third time to fully understand it, strikes me as just poor storytelling. As well as being a cheap ploy."
"mbiajc","9","1","5","15 August 2004"," By far the most creatively made movie I have ever seen.
","Simply amazing. I will admit that it has little redeeming quality message wise, but the film is superbly made, and is really an original creative work of art. I cannot even begin to fathom the technical complexities of writing a script chronologically from two points in time, having the story work from those two points toward each other until they meet in the middle, and make all of it make sense only then, and yet manage to build suspense and keep peoples' interest up to that point. Simply stunning acting on the parts of Carrie Ann Moss and Guy Pierce, and just enough comedy to keep it from being as dark as it could have been. The plot twists keep changing everything you already knew, and there are plenty of moments where you think, oh...so he did that because....oh. It is quite a roller coaster of a film and comes off artistically as about a nine out of ten."

","Alright, Memento. The idea, the plot, the approach of direction (the reverse chronological order), all that was incredibly great. But as for the ending, it just frustrates you, leaving you in a state of ""okay so what just happened?"" <br/><br/>I have actually seen this movie like a year or so back, and at the end of it I wasn't exactly its biggest fan, but I thought my opinion would have changed so I decided to watch it again. No, my opinion hasn't changed. It's actually a pain, I must have looked through a hundred or so IMDB comments on this movie looking for spoilers, just to comprehend the movie. And yes, as I looked through I found many people just as dazed and confused.<br/><br/>See the problem with this movie was that it was unnecessary confusing, like normally in a movie like this (don't get me wrong I think this movie is very original and unique) you're confused throughout the movie hoping to be relieved at the end, but not this movie, it just confuses you even more.<br/><br/>
Yeah this movie is a great movie, it really shows talent on the director's part, really artist, i can go on about those aspects for some time now, but it comes down to the most important question. ""Is it entertaining?"" The answer is no. Unless you enjoy being confused, and don't feel that you can somehow by watching it once understand it where many could not, no its impossible, I believe this movie was made as an unsolvable puzzle.<br/><br/>As for a recommendation, you should definitely watch this movie just to appreciate it's masterpiece, but do not watch it hoping to be entertained as you would with other movies.<br/><br/>Like it says in my one line summary ""it can go either way..."""

The ending is very similar to that of The Sixth Sense, with the think-you've-got-it-but-you-don't ending. But what is more amazing is that the movie flows in reverse. The start of the movie is actually the end. If you don't get it, don't worry because there may not be many people who do. As well as that, the ending leaves you wondering, well after the movie has finished, what the truth is.<br/><br/>Many questions will be thrown back and forth through the heads of mind boggled participants in this highly confusing, yet strangely compelling piece of cinema.

"Quinoa1984","10","1","18","8 April 2001"," See it twice, or more, depending on your brain
","Memento, unless you outright hate it for one reason or another, needs to be seen twice. I saw it once and immediately, as a dumb-s*** 17 year old, jumped to comparing to to the backwards-episode of Seinfeld (not, as I should've the Harold Pinter backward-plot construction he was infamous for). Now, years later, little moments and parts of performances remain in the memory. And now, how curious, to revisit the film with a greater knowledge and appreciation for film art and story construction, not to mention going through a few more Christopher Nolan pictures, and... it's much, much better than I remember it. Just luck, I guess.<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man on a mission, and he'll go after his wife's rape and murder, that is in reverse. Or really, at the start of the film its the end, and he kills a man named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who we are not sure who or what he's doing there but have some trust that out hero, or just protagonist, knows what he's doing. Does he though? His own tattoos and his own markers are not always the great markers of truth. He says others, like Teddy, lie and can't be trusted, but is it so? The color and B&W photography is symbolic of something, I think, not simply as a gimmick with creating temporal ""present"" and ""past"". It's as if they combine to create a real GRAY area, one where it's hard to tell if Teddy is telling Leonard all he needs to know (though he may be a cop in point of fact, who knows for sure what he has for Leonard, or if he'll help him in the end... not).<br/><br/>This is a tricky little movie, but seeing it with eyes fresh and mind ready for anything its really brilliant on the front of construction. A scene ends right where the last one ended, the sequences of Shelby in his motel room punctuate these scenes with his story of another man with short-term memory loss (no ""New Memories"" as he says repeatedly), and it loops back around again. By the end we have a better idea of what happened, and how Leonard was most likely not at all an innocent in the rape and murder of his wife, but we also don't have the certainty of closure. Only in the point of view of Shelby, who is an unreliable narrator, do we have a real semblance of events.<br/><br/>The effect is disorientating, but never boring, and the film-making is rich and clever and direct. There's no punches pulled by Nolan this time, and his editing is as elegant as his cinematography (the latter was much more for than the former in his Batman movies). And we feel for the characters, or at least character; especially painful is seeing how Natalie really feels about Leonard, berating him with a dirty mouth and then after being punched for egging Leonard on, sits in the car and comes back in to start the ""new"" memory that will soon fade, much like the polaroid unless its fanned out. The performances rock as well with the script, with Guy Pearce giving a career high point as Leonard (albeit I could just as easily see Steve Buscemi in the role of Teddy).<br/><br/>It's a memorable movie, ironic enough, because we care about the character's plight and descent (or is ascent) into/from hell. He has no life except this mystery to unravel, which may be no real mystery at all. It's a post-modern enigma that is fun to watch, again and again."

"andrewmerritt-31652","10","0","1","25 November 2019"," This is how you direct a psychological film
","Memento stars Guy Pearce and Carrie Ann Moss and is directed by Christopher Nolan. Guy Pearce plays Leonard a man who suffers from short-term memory loss who is looking for the killer who murdered his wife. If I could summarize this in two words it would be mind blowing. This is one of the smartest intelligent psychological thrillers of all time that doesn't go for the usual twist ending. I'm not saying that all psychological thrillers do that; I'm simply stating that no psychological thriller will ever come close to as Memento, except the Sixth Sense. I was impressed how Christopher Nolan decided to make his own psychological thriller so he can mess with the viewer's minds.
This is one of those movies where every detail of the movie counts that you can't cook or do chores, because then you would be lost and confused. We don't know much about this person, but we do get a little brief background information about him. But from the evidence that I gathered throughout I sympathize with his character because he's looking for his wife while at the same time suffering from short-term memory loss. And because of his condition I feel pity for him as the people he interacts with treat him differently. But at the same time his past life he's a jerk if you think about it and so it brings me the question of should I feel his pain or not? I'm going to end my review here because it's really hard not to give anything away with people who haven't seen this movie and I want people to experience this masterpiece without spoilers. And trust me as soon as the movie is over you will be thinking about this again and again trying to piece the puzzles together. And for the people, who have seen the movie, don't spoil it for the people who haven't. It's not cool."

","To be honest this movie is not really that great. The only reason I like it is because your get the answer to all the questions you had and didn't had in the last 20 minutes. It feels rewarding and makes you feel smart in a way because you had thought of this way before you got it confirmed. But other than that the movie is pretty lame. Not many interesting characters and the story itself is no big mystery. I mean a mystery only gets weirder as time goes (Mulholland dr) but this is the other way around. WHICH IS WHY IT GET SO MUCH PRAISE. To be real people love to know whats going on. But they love being confused and THEN in the end get all the answers. I like this to so don't think im bashing anyone here. But my point is before that moment of truth this is really nothing. The deeper you go the more dragged in to it you get but I can't LOVE a movie because the ending is pleasing while the rest of the picture is bland. But I believe the whole backwards idea is cool. Its not hard at all to follow. If you don't understand this movie im sorry to tell but you may have a mental disability. Props to Nolan for being one of the best of this generation."

","The main actor here, I forget his name, was up against Brad Pitt at the time for favorite actor among the public. He had such potential, but never was able to recover after starring in this film. I would or wouldn't have liked to see him in more movies. But the movie bases itself on him and his star power, coolness and good looks. And then goes into so much more.<br/><br/>Memento is a crazy film. It's about a scrambled film about a man who cannot remember things for more than an hour at a time. And he's hunting down the man that killed his wife. I don't really remember how it went, but the twist was that he accidentally killed his own wife or something. Which makes the movie pointless because he's just out there basically doing nothing. There's no mystery to solve, and yet he's just causing mayhem.<br/><br/>It's a really funny concept actually. The end of the film gave me a feeling that we all sometimes do pointless things to entertain ourselves and keep us happy. It's different for everyone. Some like to work long hours, others take up painting, some like adventure. It's just wasting time in whatever way we want. It's life.<br/><br/>The movie is told in a deranged way, where there really is no timeline. It's told from the ending to the beginning, but not really. There are flashbacks. And that's really the genius of the movie. I got bored in my third viewing. It's special, but not too special. Sort of like the main actor.<br/><br/>8 stars"

"nicholasttalbot","9","0","1","25 August 2019"," Memory and Identity in Memento
","In philosophical terms, Memento focuses on the questionable relevance of memory in determining personal identity, and how identity persists over time. The film's protagonist, Leonard, has a short-term memory loss condition due to a violent encounter with a rapist. He is unable to form any new memories, and last thing he does remember is his wife ""dying."" Many philosophers, such as John Locke, have argued the importance of the persistence of our personality and memory when determining identity. Is the Leonard after the incident a different Leonard than the one before? Does each independent block of remembered time represent a different person? According to the psychological account of personal identity, yes. But this is troubling to many philosophers. Let us look at Leonard's case: Every time he ""comes to"" he remembers who he is, and everything that happened to him before his wife's apparent murder. However there is an amnesia block similar to Chisholm's account. This block breaks the consistent chain of memory. As far as personality is concerned, Leonard still identifies himself as the same Leonard prior to the incident, albeit a lot angrier and more confused. If we consider an account of memory as a sort of glued-together chain, then we might be able to think of pre-incident Leonard the same as post-incident Leonard. Leonard before the incident (A) is connected to a period of forgotten time (B) who is in turn linked to present Leonard who is consciously processing his surrounding environment (C). Perhaps we can consider A, B and C the same person merely by their bonding, even though C cannot remember B (reminiscent of the General unable to remember stealing apples as a boy). However there is a glaring issue effecting the authenticity of Leonard's memories. Teddy reveals to us at the end of the film the possibility of Leonard manipulating his memories to serve his desires. If this is possible, then theoretically Leonard could, given his condition, manipulate himself to believe almost anything, since he knows very little to begin with. Does this imply that Leonard could willingly alter his identity? It sounds implausible, but given the fundamentals of the memory theory, it is not ruled out. Perhaps Leonard, as a result of his condition, is the ultimate master of his identity: a role that at times gives him great power and freedom, and other times feeds into his madness."

"leftistcritic","10","0","1","1 April 2019"," Nolan explores the depths of memory
","Last night I watched this film, after re-watching If Beale Street Could Talk, which was a sharp departure from the aforementioned film. Explored is the similar theme of memory and remembering, one which often comes up in shows like Mr. Robot, which is ending this year and Terry Gilliam's strange dystopian film, Twelve Monkeys, in 1995. The plot is simple: the protagonist, Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce, has lost his short-term memory and is trying to find the killer of his wife, Catherine Shelby (played by Jorja Fox). As he tells the audience, he lost his memory as he was knocked out after he shot his wife's killer, so he remembers ""important facts"" on Polaroids he takes and on tattoos across his body. Certain characters literally take advantage of this condition like a local bartender, Natalie, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, to kill/intimidate her boyfriend, Dodd, played by Callum Keith Rennie, and the head of a local hotel, Burt, played by Mark Boone Junior, the latter whom charges him for two separate rooms because he ""won't remember."" However, the story posed by John Edward ""Teddy"" Gammell, played by Joe Pantoliano, who claims to be an undercover cop which is investigating local gangs, including James F. ""Jimmy"" Grantz, played by Larry Holden. In the story Teddy tells, the protagonist killed his own wife, whom had diabetes, with injection of insulin, and now goes around from town to town killing people whom he claims are the ""killer"" of his wife! If this is the case, however, why does Teddy allow it to happen? Has the protagonist conditioned himself, as he claims happened with the case of Samuel R. ""Sammy"" Jankis (played by Stephen Tobolowsky) and Mrs. Jankis (played by Harriet Sansom Harris)? Or is that just a fabrication in his mind?<br/><br/>By the end of the film, the viewer is still relatively confused. Whom can be trusted? Teddy or the protagonist? We still don't know. We know no more than the story provides us. It is almost an obvious bet that every character is lying to the audience, deceiving each other in some way or another. But that makes the film interesting. In this way it is similar to Happy Accidents (2000) in that we don't know whether Sam Deed (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is telling the truth about his travel from the future to the present, or if he is just a con man trying to make ends meet. This is why neurologists praise this film, as do film critics as it is a film that keeps you thinking.<br/><br/>I could be like soloyoda in their April 2001 review of this film but I think summarizing part of the plotline is worth doing, especially since there is no ""happy ending"" to this film, or no spoilers in the sense that they will ruin the movie's enjoyment. This film is much more than what that review calls ""a highly intelligence and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards,"" although that is abundantly true without question. I would add that this film is interesting in that is not a straight narrative from beginning to end, but jumps around. In some ways this makes it resemble Pulp Fiction (1994), although that film is, in and of itself, its own animal. Additionally, I would say this film (Nolan's second film he directed after Following in 1998) differs from Nolan's other films, although it shares some similarities, in terms of a focus on memory and remembering, with Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014).<br/><br/>With that, I bring this review to a close and feel that it fully deserves a 10 out of 10, a rating I give out sparingly, only to the films I like the most."

"iamtherobotman","3","0","4","8 March 2018"," Needless backward storytelling
","So I just recently watched this having been told it was a 'complex' thriller.<br/><br/>Imagine my disappointment when I discovered it was only 'complex' due to the editing.<br/><br/>The story itself is actually extremely simplistic and were it just edited in sequence there would be no complication about it. The way the editing is done just needlessly complicates it.<br/><br/>We see him shoot someone, it cuts to him meeting someone else, we see that scene play out then it replays the scene but from further back in time, then cuts back to the shooting then cuts back to the meeting from a different angle to then return to the moments before the shooting to then switch back to a moment we haven't seen before until it returns to that scene after showing us the ending of the previous meeting which came after the shooting but before the events leading up to the shooting and after the scene we hadn't seen before.
It then jumps to the scene we hadn't seen before to then come back to the meeting of the shooting before they introduce another scene which shows the reason for the shooting which took place before the meeting we didn't see until the car was stolen...yes there's a stolen car, then the shooting is confused with the meeting before the meeting we haven't seen which led to the car being shot up and the guy chasing him after he'd had his meeting.<br/><br/>With me so far?<br/><br/>The meeting was set up by the guy who was not in the film but was spoken about when he injected his wife with insulin, the shooting happened again though it only actually happened once but the meeting took longer than expected before the insulin injection which killed the wife, or did it? The car which was stolen was not stolen but was stolen, the shooter had a car but decided to kill them anyway and they all lived happily ever after in a tattoo parlour.<br/><br/>Yeah just pseudo intellectual rubbish really. Tried to be far too clever for its own good and it didn't really work i'm afraid to say.
It wasn't complicated, it was clear what was going on and that's the disappointment in this, anyone who's anyone would know exactly what the script was so all the to-ing and fro-ing was just pointless."

"MovieSoup","9","0","1","17 September 2017"," One of Nolan's best
","Memento is a classic film with a plot that is mysterious, fast paced, intricate and brilliant. I will try to not give too much of this plot away but I will start of by saying what everyone else is saying which is ""GO SEE THIS FILM"". Honestly it is that good.<br/><br/>To start we get the main character Leonard, who has short term memory loss, committing the murder of his wife's killer. This scene has beautiful pacing to it perfectly explaining Leonard's condition by using only visual means. He is taking a picture of the dead man at his feet and is shaking the Polaroid picture. As he shakes the picture slowly fades from a clear picture to a blank one. This perfectly explains Lenny's mental condition of not being able to retain memories. It sets the film off perfectly and introduces the audience to Lenny and what he will do to overcome his condition and find his wife's killer.<br/><br/>After this the story works backward from the point where Lenny kills to how he got to this moment. The pacing and editing of this film is so unique that you are actually in the same position Lenny is as you do not know what has happened at which points in the story until the story cuts back to show you how Lenny got there in the first place. That sounds like a mindfu*k and it is exactly the way Christopher Nolan wants you to feel. Christopher Nolan is, in my opinion, the greatest director of the 2000's. His camera work is very detailed where it needs to be and you can just tell that he approaches every kind of film with caring and intelligence. Than is not to say that other directors don't but I personally find whatever Nolan puts his talents too succeeds. Dunkirk, The dark knight trilogy, inception, interstellar etc. are all timeless films that give a sense of excitement and enjoyment to me whenever I watch them. Memento's story is great and you can read into so many things with this film but let's now focus on the actors. With all the dialog and misinformation that Lenny receives during the film it would be hard for any actor to go from playing guy who has discovered something to a guy who has no idea where he is. Luckily Guy Pearce is a talented actor and plays this role perfectly, you really believe in his performance and you are completely immersed in this film and the emotional way Pearce portrays Lenny.<br/><br/>Carrie-Anne Moss is also great in this as Natalie. She manipulates Lenny for most of the film and does such a great job of switching from one emotion to the next. In one half of the scene she is screaming at Lenny in frustration and the next minute pleading with him to help her. It's just a great performance, nothing more I can say.<br/><br/>Joe Pantoliano was okay in this film. While he is believable as Teddy (the cop who helps out Lenny) and has some great dialog given to him he just wasn't as good as he could be. Whilst watching I was reminded of the role he played in the Matrix and that did at times take me out of the narrative a bit. Don't get me wrong he is a great actor and plays Teddy competently however I thought that the real performances were Moss and Pearce.<br/><br/>The music in this film is very generic however it is used to great effect to emote the scene we are watching. As I have always said, there is nothing wrong with generic score music so long as it is used correctly. The music in this film does what it is supposed to, creates atmosphere in the suspenseful parts. Music does not have to be the main focus and it isn't in this film. The main focus is plot and pacing in memento. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have written a great movie here. The actors pulled together and there are great bits of dialog and action. The pacing and editing is gorgeous and flows really well constructing a narrative but backwards. Honestly this is a great film, on of Nolan's best, and I implore you to see it."
"alexsamstheguy","9","0","1","28 August 2017"," Nolan's True Masterpiece
","Christopher Nolan is arguably the greatest film director of the 21st century. We all have probably seen his classics such as Inception, The Prestige, or the newly released Dunkirk, but I feel like Memento was his one true masterpiece that everyone started to forget about, probably because it was one of his oldest films.<br/><br/>Now Memento is probably Nolan's most frustrating film to watch, but for good reason. This film contains two different sequences that alternate throughout the film. There are black-and-white sequences that go normally, and color sequences shown in reverse order. In order to get the whole story, you have to study the movie to get whats going on in one scene, then the next color scene comes right before that. The two sequences then meet at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>This unusual presentation gives it a unique feel as if you were in a dream that makes no sense (and I can relate to that, because my dreams are the same), rather than just showing you another dream that another person is inside (like in Inception which didn't even do the best job with dreams).<br/><br/>And what adds on to this already original film is a little twist in the story involving Leonard (portrayed by Guy Pearce) who has to find his wife's murderer, but can't produce new thoughts in his mind, which explains why he has so many tattoos on his body. It is this highly original story combined with the presentation which proves this film to be among the most highly original.<br/><br/>One major difference you'll probably notice in the earlier works of Nolan is the music, which David Julyan had composed most of his early films which also includes The Prestige, which his Atmospheric scores sounded nearly perfect for Memento. I will say I preferred the music in the earlier films than the newer ones, but every films scores will fit well in their own ways.<br/><br/>Basically, Memento is what I would consider to be among Nolan's greatest, and an excellent attempt at creating an original story combined with unusual film structure. The only downside I would give is that it can be confusing the first time you watch it, but once you get the story and structure, you'll start to realize it's unique excellence that makes this Nolan's true masterpiece."

","This movie is a masterpiece and it's one of my favorites of all time. First, this film was directed by Christopher Nolan who is my favorite director, this guy is excellent at his job so when i was going to watch Memento, i was very excited to see what he could do with this film.<br/><br/>This movie is about Leonard Shelby who is a person that is trying to solve a crime involving his wife but he has this condition that makes him forget things very quickly so he has write all the puzzle pieces of this crime somewhere to solve it. <br/><br/>In the opening scene of Memento you are instantly into the film and makes you have this feeling of mystery and you ask yourself to many questions even before the movie really starts. The one thing that makes Memento so great and different from other films is the structure that this film has, which Nolan nailed perfectly. Christopher Nolan directs this film so well that the structure it self makes you have Leonard's condition, because you are trying to put all the pieces together, but has the movie goes, you forget things that happened before, and that's why you can't see this movie once.<br/><br/>Every time that you watch this movie you find something new, and it's really great.<br/><br/>Do i have to talk about the performances here? My god, Guy Pearce was so good in this film. The fact that this character it's so real, you don't even noticed that he is acting. One actress that also was great in this movie was Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, i think that it's one of her best performances.<br/><br/>All this along with the amazing editing, the script, the performances by all the actors, the directing, and the rest of the work that was done by really talented people.

","Many people said they had to seer this twice to ""Get it"". Well I always said ""Most people are stupid"".<br/><br/>This film has two stories going on.

","8/10<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie had a stellar story, acting and cinematography but I think its primary area of success comes from the fantastic gimmick uses throughout. Would Recommend.<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly interesting and keeps you hooked all the way through. That said, I think that the movie's primary strength is its great gimmick. It's a gimmick movie, no doubt about that, but it does actually have enough substance to back it up.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, this movie is excellent. The editing in this movie is phenomenal and the way that Nolan uses it to tell the story backwards is really just brilliant. <br/><br/>They say that Guy Pearce is never the answer and I would usually agree with the exception of this movie. He plays a genuinely troubled man and I bought him in every scene he was in. You could really feel how his character arc reverses throughout the movie and the movie wouldn't be as good as it is without his amazing performance. Carrie Anne-Mosse was also pretty good as Natalie but I do think that most people could have played her and don't think that Anne-Mosse actually added anything special to the role. Joey Pantolino was actually great as Teddy and really convinced me of his character. All the acting was great in this movie and really helps drive this movie. All the characters in the movie are also great and work as the main force of this movie. <br/><br/>I adore the story for this movie. It's intriguing. It's intense. It's a mind {INSERT PROFANITY HERE} if there ever was one. Add that to Nolan's spectacular non-linear storytelling and you have a phenomenal story. I do actually think that the way Nolan presented this story was the primary driving force of it. In what's become typical Nolan fashion, the ending is mysterious and only furthers the genius of this film's script.<br/><br/>Memento is a movie that is told in reverse. There is no real way to explain how awesome that is and how well that works other than to write this review in the same way. The driving force of this movie is the gimmick of it and that is okay because Nolan also provided us enough substance and meat to keep the potatoes edible. Guy Pearce gives one of his best performances as Leonard Shelby. The other supporting cast are also pretty good and the help drive this movie. It's mainly down to Nolan's unique script and insane mind that make this movie shine. I can't pick out my obvious flaws other than I can see many people not being satisfied with the ending of this movie. That is understandable because it took my a few hours to compile my thoughts on it. If you can take the mind {INSERT PROFANITY HERE} of Nolan's ingenious writing, you'll probably enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>'MEMENTO' was directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne-Mossee and Joey Pantolino. It's the story of Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce), a man with short term memory loss, who attempts to hunt down the man who murdered his wife and gave him his condition."

","'Memento' is director Christopher Nolan's tribute to classic film noir tales of revenge and mystery. By adding a new twist to traditional conventions, Nolan is able to consume and grip the viewer throughout the entire film and for years after. The aspect that differentiates this neo-noir from its competitors today is its jumbled and complex narrative which continually moves backwards in time. The viewers first see the main character complete his revenge murder (a triumphant scene we usually associate with the ending of film noirs). We then begin to see events unfold backwards and the reason for this becomes clear.<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) and his wife are attacked in their home. His wife is murdered but Guy Pearce is left with a brain condition that disables him from creating anymore short-term memory. Constantly being reminded of the horror of the situation, he is relentlessly spurred on to get his revenge on his wife's killer. As the viewer progresses through the film, they begin to feel more and more like Lenny. The audience have no idea of what has happened prior to the scene currently showing and so we are left feeling the same confusion as our protagonist. To cope with his condition, he maintains a system of notes, photographs, and tattoos to record information about himself and others, including his wife's killer. He is aided in his investigation by ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), neither of whom he can really trust (both of the latter actors starred together in 'The Matrix (1999)' in which Pantoliano was not to be trusted, disorientating the informed viewer more).<br/><br/>The film's events unfold in two separate, alternating narrativesâ€”one in colour, and the other in black and white. Leonard's investigation is depicted in five-minute colour sequences that are in reverse chronological order, however, the short black and white scenes are shown in chronological order and show Leonard on the phone to a mysterious stranger having a conversation that the viewers cannot understand (these sequences are more direct references to the film noir genre that Christopher Nolan is embracing). This style of directing makes the audience completely empathise with Leonard's situation as you never know more than he does, but also it creates huge comedic and emotional moments which rely heavily on the notion of dramatic irony.<br/><br/>With Nolan's use of hand-held camera work, an overtone of pink colouring, and sharp editing (the only transition effects in use are occasional fade outs) the viewer is made to feel disorientated and is therefore able to empathise more with Leonard's character. The original idea was a short story by Nolan's brother, Jonathan who also helped with the screenplay. The dialogue in the film is its best feature with its insightful, powerful and heart-wrenching speeches about the nature of memory. As we learn how we rely upon memory for our sense of reality, we begin to question reality itself. The idea of faith and constant references to the bible can make the entire film a metaphor for people's faith in Christianity or any other religion at that."

","To be realistic, After watching the film, i began to look for the differences between Jonathan Nolan and Einstein yeah it's true, also that movie made me in love with Nolan for the first time.<br/><br/>The Script was very clever, mysterious and complicated, and increasing his greatness step by step and his power directly after watching the first plot for the film.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie make your brain work during of the show, also the reason for my admiration is that this movie will catch you totally so you must have all your attention and focus to understand it perfectly, memorizing events, the ability to link all the events in a way to obtain a full complete story plot ( it's a little bit hard ).<br/><br/>#Memonto More Than Just a Movie 9/10 !!"
"TheLittleSongbird","10","0","6","22 January 2017"," A very strong contender for Christopher Nolan's best film
","Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.<br/><br/>'Memento' was not his first film, having directed 1998's 'Following', but has been considered by many the film that rose him to fame and brought the world's attention to him. Cannot disagree with this, and also that not only is 'Memento' his first great success but seventeen years later it gets my vote as his best film. It really makes one think hard about what is happening, crucial in a film where a lot of concentration is needed, without being treated like you are an idiot or dumber than you are. It is also one of the few Nolan films where it was difficult to find anything to fault.<br/><br/>As always with Nolan, 'Memento' is a wonderfully made film. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious , with some scenes strongly reminiscent of film noir (as a fan of film noir that was great to see). David Julyan's synthesised (something that could have sounded tacky but actually adds a lot to the atmosphere) score makes very clever and dynamic use of distinct sounds, oppression, yearning, loneliness and loss having a haunting but also affecting vibe, the feeling of being lost adrift being perfectly captured.<br/><br/>Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and the length, after seeing some later efforts that have suffered from over-length and over-ambition ('Interstellar'), was ideal.<br/><br/>It is the story that makes 'Memento' Nolan's most fascinating film, with a unique non-linear, time-reversed structure with two converged time-lines. That sounds on paper confusing but with Nolan telling the story in an intricate, tense and atmospheric way (meaning that he takes his time telling the story) it makes perfect sense, with beautifully interwoven use of thematic motifs of memory, guilt, perception, self-deception and grief and a stunningly moving ending that one does not expect.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce is astonishing and give one of his career's best performances, don't think from personal view that he's been as good as this since. He gets excellent support from particularly Joe Pantoliano and even Carrie-Ann Moss.<br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant film and a contender (my personal vote certainly) for Nolan's best film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Rahal97","10","0","2","29 December 2016"," Nolan the king of thrillers!
","So simple but yet so complicated!<br/><br/>This movie was shot in only 29 days and the chronological order was reversed(it's in backwards), but it is a bit complicated to understand by the viewers. But this doesn't make this movie any less awesome than it is!<br/><br/>Memento is one of the greatest thrillers you will ever watch, in my opinion it is the best movie of the year 2000, better than Gladiator and Requiem For A Dream. Giving its secret will be unfair but it's a movie that calling it amazing is unfair. in the end it will blow your mind."
"generationofswine","10","0","2","19 December 2016"," An Honest Review
","It is so hard to write honest reviews about Nolan films without coming under the radar and getting attacked by Nolan fans. It's an odd bunch of people, not unlike the TEA Party in the US, where any criticism is pounced on with uncompromising gusto? ""You're an idiot if Taxi Driver is your favorite film, Nolan didn't direct it!!!!"" Fortunately Memento is one of his movies where I can safely say it's worth 10 out of 10 without feeling like I am selling out to they sycophants.<br/><br/>For starters Guy Pearce does an amazing job and that is generally not the case in his movies. The Hurt Locker, The Proposition, L.A. Confidential, there are very few movies where he was actually believable in the part. So we have that and it generally takes a competent director to bring it out of him.<br/><br/>Then the plot itself, what is it? Comedic mystery? Would that be a decent enough title for it? It weaves itself in and out of the story, taking time to use Leonard's peculiar memory to it's best comedic effect.<br/><br/>The plot heavily revolves around his extremely short term memory and, because of that we get to see the movie through his eyes and all the complications that come with it, both in their most brutal and their most brutally funny as he attempts to solve his wife's murder and gets exploited along the way.<br/><br/>It's just a great film, funny and violent, like I love them."

","Leonard is trying to find killer of his wife but considering he has a short-term memory loss that makes things very difficult so he has to overcome a lot. Complexity of the movie as it goes starts to feel easier but everything that you learn from storytelling makes new questions. Teddy is cop that is helping Leonard in everything that he needs in finding mysterious John G. Natalie is woman that under all circumstances met Leonard and used him to help her deal with her problems and in return did a simple thing for him. Sammy reference from the beginning was incredibly mixed in whole movie. Editing of the movie and how it proceeded was incredible considering that storyline was very complicated but with all things that you learn it got brilliant. Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano did a fantastic job in playing their characters and how movie was put together they all had some mystery until you learn it when it all comes in one place. Praise to originality of the screen writing idea, original short story by Jonathan Nolan and finally incredible directing of Christopher Nolan. 4/4"

","Generally i like Christofer Nolan's movies but Memento has something special something unique. It was the first movie of this director i ever watched , and i really loved the way he directed it. The story is being told from the end to the beginning. That makes it even more interesting. The plot is actually a bit commom but the direction and the acting make the movie interesting and worthwatching. Yes this movie is old , created 16 years ago but in my opinion its classic. While you are watching you should pay attention else you will miss important clues. This movie knows how to keep you interested. And for sure you will enjoy watching it."

","Having been meaning to watch this movie for along time, I finally got round to it. However after I had finished watching it for the first time I felt a great need to watch it again, and so I ended up watching the entire movie two nights in a row. This was for two reasons: firstly, because the narrative of the movie is very confusing and you have to concentrate very hard just to understand what the heck is going on in most of the scenes, so naturally I knew that if I were to watch it again I would be able to follow it and enjoy it much more; and secondly because the movie was just so, so good the first time around I really, really wanted to see it again. I've been a fan of Nolan's films for a long time now (ever since I first saw Batman Begins) and this was almost the last of his movies that I had left to watch. I love his unique style of directing and have greatly enjoyed all of his films - Memento being no exception.<br/><br/>Like Inception or Interstellar, the plot can be hard to follow and it all only makes sense once you have seen and understood the ending. The narrative is especially unique - the movie is told in two different timelines, one in colour, one in black and white. The black and white timeline is chronological (just like any other movie), but the main timeline, the one in colour, is told non- chronologically, in that the audience sees all the events happening backwards, making the audience have to concentrate very hard to follow the story. The film leads towards the collision of the two timelines - where the chronological storyline meets with the non- chronological storyline - in which the climax of the story takes place. <br/><br/>It's a daunting idea for a movie, and can be difficult to follow at times, but Nolan pulls it off delightfully. Like his other movies, the directing and writing (both done by Nolan) are excellent. The way he shoots the movie is very unique and the way it is edited gives it a very distinctive feel. It's an intense movie, and does well to keep the layer of mystery present throughout, as the audience never quite knows what could happen next. <br/><br/>The performances are also a strong point. Guy Pearce, as the lead, portrays his character in a realistic and suitably depressing manner, and I honestly cannot fault his performance. There aren't many supporting characters, and the only ones that get much screen time are Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano's characters. Both give good performances and most importantly fit their roles. The casting is impeccable, but ultimately Guy Pearce steals the show. <br/><br/>This is an incredible movie and anyone who is a fan of unique styles and movies is sure to love this as much as I did. It's a movie which I cannot fault, and by far the best movie I've seen in a long time. 10/10 - would undoubtedly recommend."
"Leofwine_draca","9","0","3","28 August 2016"," Genius thriller
","This unique and well-crafted tale is a top-notch thriller packed with suspense, excellent characterisation, and a style of story-telling which means the viewer has to use his or her brain for a change. Unsurprisingly it seems to have been ignored by the mainstream crowd, but in any case it's one of the best (if not THE best) films of 2000. Guy Pearce is outstanding in the leading role of Leonard, a man who has developed a short-term memory loss syndrome since a horrific accident which means he cannot remember anything for longer than twenty minute intervals. Thus he is forced to tattoo clues on his body and take Polaroids to remind himself of his quest, which is to hunt for the man who raped and murdered his wife and kill him.<br/><br/>The genius thing about this film is that it starts at the end (Leonard begins the film by killing the man responsible) and goes back to the beginning. I was pretty sceptical of how this would work but director Christopher Nolan has done himself proud. The style of story-telling involves one scene ending and the next scene finishing at the beginning of the previous one. Confusing at first, but don't worry as Nolan takes things slowly, giving the viewer time to get used to the method before hitting them with two-faced characters, plot twists, and some tense situations. The film is extremely suspenseful in that you really get inside Leonard's head and can sympathise with his plight and the unusual story makes for lots of interesting situations and ideas. On top of this, there's a breath-taking surprising twist ending (or is that beginning?) which rewards the viewer for watching and is as good as any I've seen beforehand (THE USUAL SUSPECTS or otherwise). The film is technically excellent, the supporting cast brilliant, and I can't fathom why Nolan or Pearce failed to get Oscars for their parts in this. Seek it out now."

","The film starts with the Polaroid photograph of a dead man. As the sequence plays backwards the photo reverts to its undeveloped state, entering the camera before the man is shot in the head. This is followed by sequences of black and white chronologically and color reverse- chronologically interspersed.<br/><br/>The black-and-white sequences begin with Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) in a motel room speaking to an unnamed telephone caller who is not shown on- screen. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, the result of an attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife (Jorja Fox), but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. As an insurance investigator, Leonard recalls one Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), also diagnosed with the same condition. Sammy's diabetic wife (Harriet Sansom Harris), who was not sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin injections to try to get him to break his act. He overdosed her, falling into a coma and dying as a result.<br/><br/>The color sequences are shown reverse-chronologically. In the story's chronology, Leonard gets a tattoo, based on self-directed instructions, of John G's license plate. Finding a note in his clothes, he meets Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), a bartender who resents Leonard as he wears the clothes and drives the car of her boyfriend, Jimmy. After understanding his condition, she uses it to get Leonard to drive a man named Dodd (Callum Keith Rennie) out of town and offers to run the license plate to help his investigation. Meanwhile, Leonard meets with a contact, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Teddy helps with Dodd, but warns him about Natalie; Leonard finds a photo written to not trust him, however. Natalie provides Leonard the driver's license, which shows a John Edward Gammell, Teddy's full name. Confirming Leonard's information on ""John G"" and his warnings, Leonard meets Teddy and drives him to an abandoned building, killing him as shown in the opening."

","Memento Who am I in a Capitalist world?<br/><br/>*** This review may contain spoilers *** <br/><br/>You watch Christopher Nolan's Memento like you build a puzzle. In a reverse chronological timeline story, each scene is important to the next, but in this case the next is even more important for you to understand the previous scene. Complicated? Memento presents a three- act structure in which the three acts are cut together, whereas its structure presents two linear timelines running against each other, which are cut together and meet in the middle, separated by the transition from black and white film stock to color. The confusing narrative recalls the tension of our daily lives where we are so involved in our mundane personal world that we forget to ask ourselves what is going on. We got stuck in the past, immobile, without any hopes about the future, forgetting living the present. Memento can be seen as neo film noir when it attempts to re-establish the moods and themes of classic noirs flourished in America in the period of 1941-58. Refashioned for present-day feelings, working as metaphor for a symptom of society's evil. In this context, Memento can be seen as the gloomiest of all noirs because it shows anxiety, pessimism, and suspicion as a result of the tensions and insecurities of our modern time. The problems presented are real and contemporary; they belong to us, our despair regarding the world's future. Who are we? And for what purpose are we here? In a capitalist world where the greed and corruption seems to be engulfing us into a decadent society, it shows us another kind of darkness: the psychological torment where our minds are stolen to the capitalist service."

","Memento is a movie that is actually quite hard to review because it is so unique and different but I'm going to try to do it anyway. First of all this movie is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan he adds such suspense and mystery to every shot and scene in this movie. The movie is one that intentionally played in reverse by starting of a scene in a certain situation and the next scene will take place before that explaining how he got into that situation it's works perfectly for Memento as it is a perfect way to put the viewer in Leonard situation and reflect how much his condition holds him back. Guy Pearce in my opinion is a good actor who can really do wonders when given the right script and wonders is exactly what he did here as this today remains his best and most complex performance because through his performance you are able to feel sorry for him while still being able to be untrustworthy. Carrie Ann Moss is also very good in this movie as like Leonard you don't know how to trust her and she is the polar opposite of Leonard selfish and manipulative. The screenplay in this move is one of the best ever written in my opinion as there's just no other movie like this and every scene has a new mystery to it. Memento is in my top 20 movies of all time at is really should just how good a written and director Christopher Nolan is continuing to keep up this standard over 15 years later. 100%-A+"

","I'm not entirely sure, but the last time I checked, time goes forwards not backwards. This is what makes this film terrible. Christopher Nolan didn't have the foresight to edit this film in proper sequence, a rookie error.<br/><br/>I remember in my early days of directing, I would be sitting at my Moviola and all of a sudden, the film reel would spring off the spools and into my uncoordinated, meaty arms. Next thing I knew, I had miles upon miles of film pressing down hard upon my muscle-less body. I had stay there for 2 weeks before my mum found me.<br/><br/>In the following week, I spent the majority of my time straightening the now noodle like coagulation of film. I had already split the film up into the constituent scenes but there was no way of telling the order because during the one-man fracas, I had fallen inadvertently performed a flying triple axle dragon kick on my film projector crushing it immediately into a fine dust. Because of this, I had no other option but to just guess which scenes should go where.<br/><br/>After stitching all the scenes together at random I had myself a film. But what to call it? There were film festivals coming up and it had to have a name and without a linear structure, the name, 'I Stab Your Balls in a Chornological Progression Over The Course of Many Scenes From Multiple Perspectives', would make no sense whatsoever. I went to the desk of the festival, film reel tucked nicely into the warm embrace of my fanny pack and when the receptionist asked the name of my film, I had a stroke of genius. Rashomon! I'll call my film Rashomon! I had no idea what it meant but it sounded nice and that sure tickled my fanny. I submitted Rashomon (which has proved to have been my magnum opus ('magnum opus' in Latin meaning 'accidentally good film' (obviously))) and it won the Palme D'or. It was the greatest day of my life and the last time I shed a tear. That's right, I am legendary film director, Akira Kurosawa.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as I sat in that cushy theatre in Cannes watching back my award winning film, I realised that I despised my creation. 'No film should ever be made like this ever again', I thought to myself as I hurriedly drew out a plan on the back of my hand. The plan was one sentence long and read simply: 'BURN THIS GARBAGE'. I slipped in to the projection booth, snapped the projectionist's neck and set the monstrosity ablaze. Sitting in that projection, heated by the warmth of a fire fuelled by a film that I despised, I sought to stop anyone from creating a non-chronological film in the future. Unfortunately, I died before Memento could come out so I could do nothing about it. My actions that day ended up claiming the lives of all of those viewing my film and inspiring the ending of Inglourious Basterds, whatever that is.<br/><br/>1/10 for the reasons I have laid out."

","Short Review<br/><br/>Memento is an engaging and beautifully crafted movie. The mystery keeps the audience at the edge of their seats. The twist at the end of the movie is brilliant and deep at the same time. As the movie go, it unravels a thought provoking truth with multiple possible backstory.<br/><br/>Detailed Review<br/><br/>One of the most brilliant yet unrecognized movies that I've came across is Memento which is released as early as year 2000 and is a ""mystery & suspense, drama movie"" according to rotten-tomatoes. Memento is a brilliant masterpiece directed by Christopher Nolan, the director of The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, The Prestige and Interstellar which made him one of the most critically acclaimed directors today. As of now, the movie has received 2 Oscar nominations, won 50 other awards and has been nominated for 42 other awards.<br/><br/>Essentially, Memento tells you a backward story about Leonard Shelby who's in the midst of the search for the man who raped and murdered his wife, but what makes it much more interesting is that he can't make any new memories since an accident, so he's got to rely on his existing memories, notes and instinct to find the killer, and as the movie progress, you'll find yourself at the edge of your seat as each character's traits are starting to unravel. The movie is very mind twisting and since it's a backward movie, you'll find it very unique and fresh. The camera-work, look, and soundtrack is just perfect and immerse you in the story. Plus, the acting is so well done and very convincing.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Memento is not for everyone since the plot can be difficult to stomach at times, but if you're anything like me, who likes to see brilliant twists here and there, then Memento is a must- see."
"Horror-yo","9","0","3","21 May 2016"," Nolan's best, most certainly
","First off, this reviewer thinks Nolan is a massively overrated, so definitely no bias/fanboy-ness here. On its own, this film is superb. It's a good concept, and an even better execution of it. The plot, despite having a very plain core, is actually quite complex and strengthened by strong dialog and other secondary elements, such as the anecdotes for one. All relevant to the plot. Guy Pearce is an excellent actor, however almost too discreet he may always be or difficult to grasp, he puts in just the right performance for this lead role, so very demanding in the field of tight proximity with the audience and raw, realistic acting. So much of the film lays entirely on his shoulders and performance, and it's no coincidence it's such a strong film. The cinematography is deliberately simple, and he is at the center of every scene. The film is straight-to-the-point and there is enough actual story substance that this never feels like it lingers on about the plot or stretches the main concept and rather actively moves forward smoothly. Ultimately, beyond the 'mere' structural strength and unusual chronological format, quality acting and cinematography generally; there is a genuine point, an actual meaning to the story rather than just a (good) story. The twist at the end contributes enormously to the film's strength while maintaining coherence, giving true closure to the story and a sizeable morality; as opposed to soaring out of context as to provide a bigger surprise (which Nolan often does in his films, actually)."

","I think the reverse shot is the most splendid part of this movie, inducing the audience to think and reflect after each clip, turning it from a plain psychology movie into a detective movie. We can almost figure out step to step, from Teddy is the bad guy to Natalie is using Leonard to achieve her own purposes, to Leonard murdered Jimmy for god knows what reasons, to Teddy is a cop that is helping Leonard all along and Natalie is punishing Leonard by tricking him into killing Dodd because she knows Leonard has killed Jimmy, to knowing that Leonard made this whole bunch of nonsense up to give his life a purpose. The movie gives you a chronic panic that diffuses slowly in your heart, making you fear about the real world, and even doubting your own memory.<br/><br/>I couldn't tell you how scared I was when Natalie make Leonard punch herself and slip into the car and wait, then come back to the room pretending to be injured by Dodd, then Leonard turns furious and come after Dodd for revenge, but in a following scene Leonard think to himself: ""I am chasing him. No, he is chasing me."" And Dodd came after Leonard with a gun, because Natalie told Dodd that Leonard was the guy that ran away with a stack of cash and drugs because she wanted to solve Leonard and Dodd together, wishing both of them to be dead. But the misunderstanding between Dodd and Leonard made by Natalie is half true because Teddy, the bad cop, did gave him half the cash after he sold the drug himself. This might be what Leonard himself called ""poetic justice"".<br/><br/>Sammy Jankis was the character that gave me the most tremendous shock. He was a real person, but he was not the one that injected his wife with too many insulin to cause her death, Leonard was the one. Leonard had to create a false life for himself because in real life he killed his wife by injecting her insulin for three times. When realizing that, I couldn't help feeling more depressed.<br/><br/>Most importantly, this film shows how fatal is this to be completely ignorant of common psychology. Natalie told Leonard when she tried to get him punching her: ""How blissful ignorant you are!"" Sammy also was so frustrated that she tested her husband with such fatal tool, which caused her own life and Leonard's life too. But from the start, if they get a therapist then everything it gonna be fine. Leonard's wife don't have to die, Leonard don't have to punch Jimmy and wear his suit from the start, and Teddy wouldn't have to die. Leonard suffered from the damage of hippocampus, he could have accepted a hippocampus transplant and retrieve his memory, but somehow his brilliant mind didn't reach that thought. This tragedy wouldn't have happened if they trust science a little more, because neuroscience was advanced enough to cure Leonard in the time of film: 2000."

Memento contains two narratives that begin separately but progressively converge on each other. One of them starts in the present and then move backwards and the other in the past and moves forwards.

"benn4302016","9","0","3","30 April 2016"," My review for a college class.
","I chose the movie ""Memento"" for my IMDb review. It's a murder mystery suspense that has a tendency of messing with your mind as you get deeper into the plot of the movie. Guy Pearce plays a man named ""Leonard"" who has short term memory loss due to being attacked in a home invasion along with the rape and murder of his wife. Which leaves Pearce from making new memories and trusting only Polaroid's and notes that he had written each day. He teams up with co-stars Carrie-Ann Moss who plays ""Natalie"" and Joe Pantoliano as ""Teddy"" to help piece together a conclusion to who the man is that raped and murdered his wife.<br/><br/>This shifty film has parallel stories or a form of cross- cutting that coexist with each other. The opening scene with Leonard killing Teddy is actually the ending of the movie. The movie begins with a Polaroid photo returning to its non-exposed state and returning back into the camera. Giving the viewer just enough time to use their imagination on what just happened to fast forward to earlier that day to explain the events that come to play. Each day trough out the movie is played out like this, end of a scene then a flash back on how they got there. Forcing a viewer to keep in mind facts that have been viewed a way to explain how they came about.<br/><br/>In between this backwards told story, a series of black and white scenes actually play out as real time of what Leonard learns as time goes by. Learning while speaking on the phone at his hotel room to a person he does not know besides being a possible police officer. Using this style of cinematography allows the viewer to try and imagine the story in whole. Taking the clues and or facts that have been presented in the colored scenes that are moving backwards and comparing them to the black and white shots drawing the plot even thicker. <br/><br/>Just when a viewer thinks they have an idea on what has happened to this mentally crippled man, with his life erased forever, with only the haunting image of his wife dying on the floor of their home a new plot is introduced. With a quick two minute scene his so called help turns against him tricking him into doing something he would not have done if his memories were true. Natalie the one Leonard can trust the most takes any writing device that can be used so to help him remember what happens and uses his disability to her advantage. Calling him names and talking ill of his wife causing Leonard to lose his cool and then striking her causing injury. Once Leonard has forgot what has happened she plays out a different scenario for him to believe another man caused this.<br/><br/>The use of manipulation during this film takes the cake. Finding out that a person could take advantage of someone like Leonard is just amazing. Its one thing for Natalie to do it but to find out the Teddy all along is the man he has been looking for that committed this heinous crime is outstanding. Finding out the killer he was looking for actually was looking after him so to make sure he never catches on to the series of lies really takes a real piece of strange to pull off. This movie makes a viewer question if the mental capacity of a human brain could even decipher the amount of confusion to be comfortable with the idea of killing a man. This reminds me of the film ""Shutter Island"" a murder mystery of the same theme but with a slightly different twist. Both great movies, which may cause the viewer to question the very facts of reality itself."

And after the ending you're at the peak of your intrigue so even after the movie finishes you're still finishing the puzzle in your head, something similar like Inception, another great Nolan movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm looking forward to seeing it again in the near future and I'm recommending it for everybody."

","Love such an unusual movie with a twisted plot, when you enter the story from the beginning and take a look to the end, adhering to the TV monitor or computer not to miss the slightest moment. <br/><br/>With Director Christopher Nolan is already quite familiar, or rather with his work, although I wouldn't mind personally to have a talk with him about the secrets of making interesting films. Now, this Director is different from other that creates the true masterpieces of cinema that stand out unusual stories and something new that I haven't seen we in a movie. This not only applies to the trilogy of Batman, but also such films as ""Inception"" and ""the Prestige"" in which there is everything from magnificent plot to the acting, well, plus an unpredictable ending. <br/><br/>The movie, ""Remember"" also made a good impression on me, because I have never seen this in a movie, or rather have not seen, how is it possible to make a film on the subject of our memory and thus to create a candy with a twisted plot. The plot of the film tells us about an ordinary guy who killed his wife and he's going for revenge. But that's not all, the main theme of the film is, of course, the memory of the protagonist. The fact that he can't remember what he was like 15 minutes ago and can easily forget events as recent sleep. And here he is to somehow survive began to write hundreds of different notes and to do tattoos all over the body, not to forget for what purpose he lives. Quite a strange disease, the main character, he has to remember who he was, his past life, but did not remember what happened 15 minutes ago. It was interesting to watch as he is constantly on his notes was investigating the murder of his beloved. Another thing I liked is that the film constantly monologue of the hero, although, he says, their actions, this is even more fun to watch everything going on, it's like watching a solid detective. <br/><br/>Acting is up to par. The main character was played by actor guy Pearce, who I don't remember much of other roles, only recently saw the film ""Iron man 3"" where he played the anti-hero of some scientist. Also in the film lit up and Carrie-Ann moss is known worldwide for its unforgettable role of Trinity in the ""Matrix"" trilogy. Also very well played and here. <br/><br/>In General, I would say that the film is memorable because it's something new, although the movie is old already 97 years old, but still the idea is amazing. So if you liked, say, the movie ""inception"" about our dreams and this film will not disappoint."
"olivierdikuta","8","0","1","4 March 2016"," Every end has a start
","Every end has a start. <br/><br/>In this review, I would like to examine the game of colors and anti-chronological sequences of Memento that Christopher Nolan uses in order to make his film look like a puzzle the viewers have to reconstitute so that they understand the story. <br/><br/>Nothing being left to chance, quite a few sequences of the movie are in black and white, and some others are in color for only one reason : because the film is made of two parts. Sequences filmed in color are related to the main story and the plot whereas those filmed in black and white are placed in chronological order and inserted within the main story. That triggers confusion among viewers, since they have to memorize every sequences, every elements like an investigator in order to understand the denouement, not unlike Leonard Shelby, the main character, who has a poor memory because he was hit on the head. Thus he has to write post-its or get tattoos in order to remember everything. Confusion is inherently part of the editing job carried out for this movie, with the two parts of the film ending up merging into one another, and the end being right in the middle of the story. So every scenes is left to the own interpretation of viewers until the end. <br/><br/>Christopher tends to always make movies where every sequences gives a clue to understand the movie, like in one of his others films ""Inception"". However nobody notices it at first which is why his movies should be watched at least twice. The game of colors and the anti-chronological sequences allow us to enter the skin of the main character and feel every situation as if it was actually happening to us."
"swedeandsour","8","0","1","23 February 2016"," Great film with a great plot twist
","A critical review of a film I liked.<br/><br/>I saw this film when it came out and rewatched it again, knowing what the twist was. It is a great film, but once the twist is revealed, there's not much else in it.<br/><br/>There aren't memorable or iconic shots, locations or scenes, memorable or quotable lines or dialogues, soundtrack or strong characters. The timeline doesn't allow for much character development, but characters are still one dimensional - they are who they are and that's about it. We only get to see a thin slice of time, so don't expect character growth or change, but one could still expect strong, unique, memorable characters. There's none of that.<br/><br/>There isn't much of a sub-plot or other threads competing for our attention or making the story deeper or more complex.<br/><br/>The locations were also anonymous. Everything is there just to serve the twist. There is nothing more, nothing less. It would've been interesting to be lead to a false conclusion before the reveal, or have elements that raise doubt or debate in the viewer's mind - there's none of that.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is that the film is not that enjoyable for the duration of the film, except the ending. If one were to leave before the end, he would not have enjoyed the film at all, whereas that is not the case in most films. As someone who rewatched it knowing the ending, parts of it felt boring.<br/><br/>This was not a great film with a twist at the end, but a great twist with an okay film at the start. I never find myself googling quotes from the film, searching youtube for great scenes from it, don't remember the soundtrack at all.<br/><br/>Compare this with Fight Club or Inception, where the soundtrack, characters, scenes, events and lines have such a lasting impact on viewers. But those are different films with bigger budgets, so I'm not penalizing Memento for that. I'm penalizing it for not being very enjoyable without the ending.<br/><br/>I still give it an 8/10 because although it does one thing, it does it very, very well."
"joshuafagan-64214","10","0","2","19 January 2016"," Unforgettable
","Stone cold perfect. When I finished watching this movie, I wrote down those words, so I wouldn't forget them when I did this review. No other three words could more accurately describe this movie. It may not be the flashiest, most spectacle-filled movie ever made, but it is one that leaves you thinking, That is great art. This may not be the absolute greatest movie Chris Nolan has ever made, but it is the most restrained, organized, and complete.<br/><br/>The basic story: a man with anterograde amnesia (a condition where you can't make new memories) is trying to track down the man who killed his wife. On its face, this is a simple revenge story. But this movie is far more than its face.<br/><br/>Color and black-and-white sequences are interspersed. The color sequences go in reverse chronological order from the end, whereas the black-and-white sequences go in normal chronological order fro0m the beginning. This may seem complicated, but it's really not. There not only was not a better way to tell this story, there was not another way to tell this story at all. It is not a gimmick, as its deriders have called it; it was the only way to go.<br/><br/>When the two sequences come together at the end of the 120-minute running time, you will be shocked and amazed. I was. This is not the kind of twist that can be easily spoiled. I suppose you could look it up, but even if you did, it wouldn't mean all that much to you. It's something- like the Eiffel Tower or the Pyramids- that must be experienced.<br/><br/>This is the Nolan film that caught the world's attention. This is the Nolan film that exploded into the stratosphere. In film critic circles, it was all, 'Have you seen Memento?' After this, he got funding and ran with it. In a way, Inception and Interstellar and all those Batmans were made because of this film. There are not many examples of good artists winning out and being allowed to produce more good art.<br/><br/>Technically, this film is part of the stellar 2001 crop of films, despite the fact that it came out in 2000 in Venice. This is kind of annoying, but it does give me an opportunity to show how broken the Oscars are. Both this film and Amelie were nominated for Best Original Screenplay. I would have been fine with either one winning. But neither of them won, an honor that goes to Gosford Park, a film I had never even heard of until I researched this.<br/><br/>The words 'psychological horror' are tossed around a lot these days. I'm willing to bet one out of every three or four horror movies that classify itself as psychological horrors. Hah. Hah, hah, hah. Those are psychological horror films in the same way that M. Night Shyamalan's pathetic Avatar: The Last Airbender adaptation is an epic.<br/><br/>This, my good friends and loyal readers, is a true psychological horror movie. It is not a horror movie in terms of tropes or the traditional definition of the genre, but it terrifies me more than any amount of blood and guts and jump scares or shaky cam could in a million years. I feel true fear whenever I watch this because it understands what fear is. Fear is not a physical thing, like a rock or brick or castle. It is immaterial. Like the wind, it takes not shape or form or identity. It is a response to danger and confusion. The more someone understands that, the more their film can manipulate it. And Chris Nolan- as well as his brother Johnathan, who wrote the story that inspired this film- understands that.<br/><br/>Let me say that the film looks gorgeous. There are few things that look sharper than modern black-and-white filming (I would love to see that black-and-white cut of MM:FR) and the color scenes are sweeping and elegant and mysterious. Wally Pfister is a master of unshowy but well-done cinematography. His camera-work makes you see what Nolan wants you to see. It is sharp and dreamy yet focused. He is to Chris Nolan what John Williams is to Steven Spielberg. None of Nolan's films would be as good as they are without his camera.<br/><br/>The music is not outlandish or bombastic, but subtle and story-serving: perfect for a film like this. The acting is not amazing, but it is rock-solid and far better than could be expected given the film's budget. The screenplay is amazing in every way possible. You want tight? It's tight. You want innovative? It's innovative. You want twist-filled? It's twist-filled. If I made a list of the greatest screenplays of all time, this would be close to the top.<br/><br/>I honestly struggle to come up with something bad about the film. There are nineteen films I like better this, but none of them have as few issues as this one. This is Nolan at his best and sharpest. All of his strengths are at their highest, and all of his weaknesses are at their lowest.<br/><br/>If you want to get up feeling refreshed and happy, this isn't the movie to pop in. It is Nolan's most R-rated movie by far, and the ending (which I will not dare spoil for you) is a downer to be sure. But if you want to be hypnotically immersed in a masterwork by possibly the most talented auteur working today, watch it.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that blows you away even when you expect it to be great. That is rare."

","This screenplay is quite similar to the novel from Anne-Françoise Pyszora, which was filmed by Tom Tykwer in 1997. I actually preferred this movie which was set in an Alpine winter scenery. The main plot is quite similar, if not exactly the same. I wonder whether the screenplay by Nolan has not been taken from Pyszora's novel. If so I would consider this information to be absolutely necessary, otherwise one could draw the conclusion that this movie is a case of plagiarism. The plot is quite witty and original, something that is rather uncommon these days in newer films. What is quite remarkable is its non-linearity and the fact that the audience is challenged and required to participate in finding out what the outcome will be. Whoever likes this film will also enjoy Winter sleepers."
"Tweekums","8","0","2","2 December 2015"," Christopher Nolan plays with memories and time to create a gripping thriller
","Protagonist Leonard has an unusual condition; he can't form any new memories; anything that happens to him fades from his memory in a matter of minutes. He explains that he still recall events that took place before the night that he came home and discovered his wife being raped and murdered. He is hunting for the killer; to make this possible he must keep notes and take photographs to remind him who the people in his life are now, the most important facts he has tattooed onto his body. In the opening scenes we see him driving to a remote location with a man called Teddy; he looks through his pictures and on the back of Teddy's picture is says that he is the killer Leonard shoots and kills the man.<br/><br/>Because of the way the story is told this is actually the end; as the film progresses two narratives unfold; on, in black and white, moves forward, and the other, in colour, gradually moves backwards. As the two narratives converge we learn more about Leonard as well as Teddy and a woman called Natalie who helped him.<br/><br/>This early film from director Christopher Nolan is gripping and manages to avoid being too confusing as we gradually learn more about the characters. As time passes it becomes apparent that Leonard is a far from reliable narrator thanks to his condition. The way time is played with gives an idea of what Leonard's life is like; he can only trust his notes and what people tell him; not easy when his notes tell him not to trust certain people. When the truth is finally exposed it comes as quite a surprise despite hints that we have seen. The cast does a really good job; Guy Pearce does a great job as he captures Leonard's condition in a believable way, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are also great as Natalie and Teddy. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a thriller that is different check this out; you might want to watch it again though as I suspect many details will improve on a second viewing."
"Leem4004","Null","0","1","1 December 2015"," Amazing. How a low-budget indie should be done.
","Disregard its mind-bending profundities about the nature of memory and existence and what it means to be human. Even if all these things were willfully ignored and Memento were simply reduced to an architectural blueprint, it would still be akin to watching Bobby Fischer play chess, seeing the board several moves ahead of his opponent. It's an exhausting experience just to keep up—be sure to arrive on time and stay seated until the credits roll—but for Nolan to dream up a scenario this complex and yet work it out so thoroughly seems almost inconceivable. His story marries two high concepts that would be baffling enough on their own, let alone together. Traumatized by his wife's rape and murder, Guy Pearce suffers from a rare neurological disorder called anteriograde amnesia that prevents him from creating any new memories. Basically, the world as he understood it 10 minutes ago has evaporated from his mind without a trace. In order to exact revenge on his wife's killer, Pearce has devised an elaborate system of tattoos, Polaroids, note cards, and file folders to help him piece together the facts. He also has to uncover the possible ulterior motives of shady ally Joe Pantoliano and a sullen bartender played by Carrie- Anne Moss. To further complicate matters, Nolan begins with the end and ends with the beginning, so the action takes place in overlapping fragments that move backwards in time. On top of all that, he inserts black-and-white scenes of Pearce on the phone in his motel room, telling the harrowing story of a fellow amnesia sufferer (Stephen Tobolowsky) he met in his days as an insurance claims investigator. Memento has endless fun playing with hiccuping time and ephemeral memory: In one of its funniest scenes, Pearce wonders if he's being chased or giving chase; in one of its most suspenseful, he scrambles to find a pen before he forgets a person's diabolical abuses. For a while, Nolan's twin gimmicks seem to exist solely for clever gamesmanship, like the achronology in his low- budget neo-noir debut, Following. But the astonishing payoff takes the film to another level entirely, unleashing a battery of existential questions that shed new light on everything that precedes it."

This movie is a masterpiece!<br/><br/>Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man with no short-term memory who is trying to find the man who killed his wife. As the viewer, you are kept in a similar state to Leonard as you only see pieces of the story at a time. You start off with him shooting a man in the head and spend the rest of the movie trying to understanding why. <br/><br/>Because of the method of telling the story, you can relate to Leonard because you don't know any more than he does, but then you begin to feel for his situation as you slowly start to understand how the other characters are playing him. <br/><br/>Carrie-Anne Moss gives an amazing performance in an amazing role where she evolves from an seemingly abused victim, to a manipulative and malicious piece of work. I loved her in The Matrix, but she is even more impressive here. Her Matrix co-star, Joe Pantoliano, is just as good. He's a constant enigma and you never really know whether to trust him and I still don't can't decide whether he deserves the bullet at the end (or the beginning)!<br/><br/>Don't do what I did and put it off; make sure you watch this film.

With a cast composed of two opposing views from The Matrix, a future corrupt cop in Batman Begins talking to a confused future Iron Man villain in a hotel booth, and a structure that audiences are still trying to figure out today, makes up the second feature from Christopher Nolan, Memento. Get a physical copy of the film with director's commentary, and you'll second guess the last few viewings of the film to top all that off. There's no point in outlining the plot other than a guy who's trying to solve a mystery, with a short term memory problem. Whether or not the condition, or the mystery, was self-imposed is not a question that really matters until you see it. It still remains my favorite from Nolan."

","I fell in love with Christopher Nolan work with my first view of ""Inception"" I was impressed about the details and complex of the story and with that i had to see all of his other works immediately. That's how I found ""Memento"", it's one of those films who kept you thinking even after you watched the whole thing. It's good to find this kind of movies which always have you thinking and analyzing throughout the story development. Christopher Nolan is a hell of a director. the way he manipulates the storytelling is impressive and confusing. Great acting and complicated characters. Sometimes watching the movie you feel you're in the head of the main character, that's why Nolan chose to tell the story backwards so the spectator couldn't figure it out until the end and always keep everything interesting. One of the things I like the most about Nolan is that you'll never know what the next twist plot are going to be, it's always something absurd and creepy at the end. it's a must see."

","Memento is the kind of indie film which you wouldn't think could have appeal to a general audience, but surprisingly this one does, and film-goers are still discovering its brilliance today. In light of Christopher Nolan breaking onto the Hollywood scene with The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception and last year's Interstellar, Memento still holds its own ground very firmly and still has strong footing.<br/><br/>How can this film be separated from Nolan's other films? For one thing this is a post-modernist neo-noir movie, and quite the psychological kind, which is made all the more watchable by Guy Pearce's performance as Leonard Shelby, a man out to avenge his wife's death. It sounds simple, but the plot spools into a really complicated case of mystery, secrecy and femme-fatale seduction.<br/><br/>Memento is the film that showed the world Chris Nolan is a man who visually questions things in life, and in the most subtle yet cinematically clear scope which speaks truly of ourselves, and our condition. This film is no exception to that exploration.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan is one of the cinema greats of our time, and this was the beginning of his career in the American film industry, and making history."

","This is the typical movie where you have to pay attention to every detail! I really like the way the story is told, even more than the plot itself! It put you in the situation where you, like the main character, are not able to view the entire story in one single line. You are confused as long as you watch the movie, and you are even after. But then you got the occasion to put all the pieces together, rather than Leonard! I would like to try to put those pieces together now, discovering the real meaning of the movie, so if you haven't watched ""Memento"" yet, stop reading this! His wife was really raped by two bad guys, but she survived. He develops a psichiatric condition, and he can no longer remember new things. The wife is diabetic, and tests him by letting him inject her a lot of insulin. If you paid attention, there is a scene where he's preparing insulin, between one of those where the famous Sammy is doing it. And, in the end, we can see his wife hugging Leonard while his chest is nude, and he has the tattoo ""he raped my wife etc"". For this, he was moved to a psichiatric clinic. He could not live anymore realizing what he did to his wife, because he remembers, as long as his condition is mental (yes, it's a real disease, but he phisically can store new memories), so he invents a puzzle where John Q. killed his wife in Leonard's last memory: the rape. Freddy is the cop to whom the case of the rape was assigned. He starts helping Leonard, giving him the files records etc. Lenny finally kills the man who raped his wife, but then continues to manipulate his own memories! He put away 12 pages of the records, deletes many sentences etc. Freddy now decides to use Leonard to kill people, to become rich, because the main character won't remember anything. But Natalie understands what's going on, and helps Lenny to kill Freddy, in order to avenge her boyfriend. Leonard itself wanted to kill Freddy, because he told him the truth, and he can't hold it."

","This is one of the few movies that you just have to have seen. There is no way around it, you just have to. There is literally nobody that I have shown this movie to who didn't immediately like the plot- structure(and I have shown it to quite a number of people). The movie goes backwards and basically starts with the end, a murder. You then consistently go back in Leonard's memories, always rewinding a piece as if you actually were the protagonist himself. The best thing about this is: You never know what happened previously, just like Leonard doesn't. You have to figure. That's what makes this an incredibly good movie on it's own right, the creative story telling and the integration of Leonard's condition of not knowing anything that previously happened. But the end is just the cherry on the cake, literally a mind-blower you can't possibly expect when watching this movie the first time. <br/><br/>All in all, great plot, amazingly good actors, amazing storytelling, creativity and a great and unpredictable ending. This film is enjoyable from minute one to 113. Even if you watch it 5 or more times (as I have done) it just doesn't get boring. Definitely excellent!"

","Memento is a movie about Leonard (Guy Pearce). He suffers from some kind of short-term memory, but not really, because he can remember everything till the day that his wive gets murdered and raped. He himself gets a head injury, due this he gets his short- terms memory. He remembers everything by taking pictures and by putting down a little description. Leonard also puts down tattoos on his body with very important text on. These texts are clues that he found out about the murder of his wife. with these techniques he tries to track down the murderer of his wife and kill him.<br/><br/>The directing of the movie is, as always with Nolan, amazing. I don't have anything more to say about it, only that the fighting scene in the bathroom is a bit to closed up.Not the scene with the flashback of the murder. But for the rest (not sure if you say it like that in English, not native) the directing was good.<br/><br/>the acting was also very well. Really liked Guy Pearce in this movie, I personally think that this is one of his best role. Carrie- Anne Moss played one of my favorite characters. I really liked the way she played with Leonards short-term memory. This really made me hate her, but it was just so well acted. Joe Pantoliano as Teddy was a fun character, and he stays mysterious throughout a big part of the movie. <br/><br/>Some things that I liked about the movie were that you really had to pay attention during the movie. I also liked that the movie was very well created. With this I mean that you get some scenes then you get some gray and white scenes and then there are scenes that are about what happened before the first scenes and so on and so on. But the ending is just mind blowing and was my favorite part of the movie. This is because it is so well written and clever. I totally didn't see it coming and was very surprised, I literally sat there with an open mouth.<br/><br/>I am sorry if my English wasn't good and that this review is pretty short, but here are some individual scores.<br/><br/>Directing: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Acting: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Writing: 10/10<br/><br/>Ending: 10/0<br/><br/>This is a total of 39/40 which is rounded a 10/10.

","The story is there is a man named Leonard who has had short term memory loss since his wife was raped and murdered and now he's out for revenge against the killer, who he believes to be Teddy. And because of his condition he takes Polaroids and gets tattoos of what he wants to remember. The only thing I didn't like about the film was it (ironically) required memory as the story was told in an odd way, with the colour bits going backward in time e.g if at the start of the first one they said 'what are you doing . . .' at the end of the next one they'd say 'what are you doing . . .' and with the black and white bits going forward in time before they eventually met at the end of the film. Although it was a little inconvenient to remember everything that had happened it was a very interesting and clever was to tell the story as things you thought were true throughout the film were made lies as you learnt more. The story wasn't too hard to follow as long as you were paying attention and the acting was amazing. I really liked how it made you question things while you watching it. Overall a fantastic film, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a not too complicated Nolan film/a very interesting look into how memory is not the most reliable thing in the world/a person just wanting an amazing film."

Leonard is determined to find his wife's killer, but the investigation is tough with his handicap, so he tattoos himself, takes pictures, and keeps notes to remind himself of his purpose everyday.<br/><br/>Memento is suspenseful, thrilling, intense, and highly intellectual. Nolan presents the film in reverse, and it is as confusing as it sounds. As viewers, we see the clues and scenes just as Leonard would, without context, memory and quite a bit of confusion in 15 minute increments. Nolan does an excellent job letting viewers see the world as Leonard would, experiencing the frustration of memory loss. <br/><br/>This movie sucks you in from very beginning, and forces you to pay close attention; you have to focus in order to catch the clues and play the detective. In the very fist scene you see Leonard murder his friend Teddy, which leaves you questioning everything within the first few minutes. It's exciting and mind-blowing. A movie that forces you to question your beliefs once you can make sense of it all.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good brain teaser.

"lucasversantvoort","9","0","2","6 May 2015"," Still Nolan's best after all these years
","Memento was only director Christopher Nolan's second full-length feature film, but damn, what a film. I'm of the relatively rare opinion – at least if IMDb ratings are anything to go by – that this is Nolan's best film to date. Despite his popular output, this film wins in terms of pure originality.<br/><br/>Memento is based on a short story – Memento Mori – written by Nolan's brother, Jonathan Nolan. There are similarities (the dead wife, the amnesia) between the story and the film, but whereas the short story seems to function as an essay on concepts of amnesia and time, Christopher Nolan adapted these ideas in the form of a thriller, though it's anything but straightforwardliterally. Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffers from Anterograde Amnesia which means he cannot form new memories. Basically, it's short-term memory loss. He'll be aware of who he is and where he is for about 15 minutes (30 if he's lucky) after which he'll blank out, forget who he's talking to, what he's doing, etc. He's been suffering from this ever since his wife was raped and killed by two men in his home. He was able to kill one of them that night, but received a blow to the head from the other, resulting in his condition. His life since then has consisted of one thing: find the second man and kill him. To combat his condition, he takes photographs of important things in his life (his car, his motel) and has crucial information tattooed on his body. He receives 'assistance' from two other characters during his journey who may or may not have ulterior motives.<br/><br/>What's impressive is that besides being a very well made revenge thriller, the film also has plenty of time to ask the kind of philosophical questions the short story asks: what is the point of revenge if Leonard will forget he avenged his wife anyway? Do things like truth and facts apply to Leonard's condition, as in how can he truly know certain things for sure? How does the concept of time apply to someone like Leonard? What kind of life is there for Leonard besides avenging his wife? The film functions both as thriller and commentary on the drama underlying Leonard's condition.<br/><br/>In the end, what solidifies this film as a classic in the thriller genre and modern cinema in its entirety is its structure. The film has two types of scenes: color and black-and-white, and it constantly alternates between these two types. Also, the B-W scenes are chronologically correct (1-2-3), but the scenes in color are placed in reverse (Z-Y-X). Mind you: the don't literally play backwards, but are placed in reverse. So the structure can be described as followed: Z-1-Y-2-X-3, etc.). This might sound confusing, but it will make more and more sense as you watch it. One of the best things about it, is that the beginning of one color scene is also the end of the next color scene. So, you're constantly struggling to remember what came after, trying to connect the dots. The wonderful thing about it is that, like Leonard, you are also struggling from (an (artificial sense of) short-term memory loss, as you never know what came before. Many scenes begin with a confused Leonard not knowing where he is, which is also the position the viewer occupies (at least for first-time viewers). Crucially, instead of merely being a story about amnesia in filmic form, the film succeeds greatly in utilizing the possibilities of its own medium to great effect, by using editing to put the audience in the position of someone suffering from short-term memory loss, never really knowing what came before.<br/><br/>Claims about a plothole have been circulating on the internet. The question that has been asked multiple times is how Leonard is able to know he has Anterograde Amnesia when he's unable to create new memories. I for one have no idea, but I guess we have to implicitly assume it's on one of his notes or tattoos. But honestly, when a thriller is so original and downright exciting as Memento, who even cares? Would you rather have a mediocre, factually correct thriller or one with (maybe) one or two plot holes, but executed so well it actually does what its genre says it should, thrill? One made so well it made you leap out of your seat? Because that is exactly what happened to me when I first watched it in my teens. I was so blown away and ecstatic I had to pause it midway so I could run up to my parents and extol to them the virtues of Memento. If that doesn't motivate you to watch it, then I don't know what will."
"sandnair87","9","0","2","30 April 2015"," Nolan's Brain-Wringing Memento will Not Be Easily Forgotten!
","Many psychological thrillers rely on twists to deliver their climactic pay-off. But director Christopher Nolan's brain-wringing psycho noir Memento isn't just a movie with a twist - It is a twist! <br/><br/>Essentially, Memento is a straightforward revenge flick with the central protagonist out to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife. But this standard plot comes with an ingenious twist, as we soon find out that our befuddled hero is on a voyage of self- discovery like no other. Matters are complicated by the fact that the person investigating the killing Leonard Shelby (an outstanding Guy Pearce, eliciting sympathy and hinting at the rage behind his obsession, while also leavening the character with moments of humor) has the memory of a goldfish – a rare form of amnesia leaving him with no short-term memory. Forced to record everything with copious notes, Polaroid photographs and even tattoos, Leonard's obsession leads him into a world where no one can be trusted. This coupled with Christopher Nolan's audacious conceit that necessitates the plot to run backwards, makes Memento a dazzling, highly original 'anti-thriller'. Thus, we begin with the climactic murder then regress through the events that led up to it to wind up, well, at the beginning!<br/><br/>Memento is a mesmerizing mind-bender, a diabolical and absorbing experience that requires a lot of concentration, but the stunning final scene is ample reward. Christopher Nolan builds a mousetrap of a neo-noir, using the tricky gimmick of a complex, purposefully disorienting narrative that puts us in the scrambled mind of its protagonist. As the strangely captivating screenplay unfolds in scenes of reverse order, he gives us a taste of Leonard's frustrating existence: events unfolding for the audience in the same way they unfold for Pearce's character. We're thrown out of time and robbed of the comfort of a (chrono)logical unspooling of information. Nolan cranks up the suspense, keeps the story sharp and pacey, and isn't afraid to layer in a little ultra-black humor. The impact is insidious - chances are your brain will be replaying this fiendish puzzle of a film for months to come.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan's cinematic gaze into an abyss of madness, obsession, identity and wrath remains a compelling puzzle long after its revelations have rolled out. Of all the ironies which fill the film, the most complementary may be that this is film which will not soon be forgotten."
"squirrel_burst","10","0","2","1 April 2015"," It's more than a movie, it's an experience.
","""Memento"" is brilliant and expertly pieced together. It's more than a movie, it's an experience. How is that possible? Unfortunately it's impossible to describe to you why that is unless you know the premise, so here goes: Our protagonist (Guy Pearce) is a man named Leonard. He is on a seemingly impossible quest for revenge after his wife's rape and murder by an unidentified assailant. The attack left him with a head injury that now prevents him from forming new memories. He knows who he is, he remembers everything up to the moment where he suffered the injury but if he has a conversation that lasts too long, he won't remember how it started. Now, using clues from the night, limited information from the police file that's gone cold, Polaroid photographs, hand-written notes to himself and help from people he has met, Leonard is slowly tracking down the man responsible.<br/><br/>Now that you have the premise of the film, there is another vital piece of information that you must know in order to understand what this movie is like. The movie is told in reverse, with the scene that would normally be at the very end of this story being shown at the beginning, and so on. This means that just like the protagonist, you don't know what causes actions or how Leonard go to a spot as its happening. This is where the brilliance of the film comes in. Just like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", where the drug trip the characters go on, and the experience of watching the movie feel like the same, the condition that Leonard suffers and the experience you will get from watching the movie are the same. It's hard to wrap your brain around this, but even if you're dubious about it working (trust me, it works incredibly well), have you ever seen a movie that tries to pull a trick like this? It's a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>What I love about this movie is that it's not just a gimmicky story; it would still be just as interesting to watch if it was told in the ""normal"" order. It's a story about revenge like no other because it exposes the biggest flaw about going on a quest to get even in a way that no other movie about the subject can. If you were out on the path of vengeance, you might get satisfaction from killing the person that murdered your wife, but that isn't going to get her back. The purpose of revenge then, is revenge itself. You seek retribution in order to give yourself the satisfaction that you have done something. But what happens when you don't even have that? What happens when you find the guy and you take gleeful pleasure in making him suffer so intensely that he prays for death, but once the deed is done you can't even remember it happening? I'm a huge fan of films about payback because there's something primal about them that is satisfying, but they also lend themselves very well to complicated ideas and paradoxes. This is one of the smartest and most original stories of revenge that I've seen.<br/><br/>There's even more going on with this movie because it plays wonderfully with the condition that Leonard suffers from (the technical term is anterograde amnesia). As the story unfolds you see that many people sympathize with the man's condition, while others use it to their advantage and ultimately it becomes impossible to know who he can really trust. The further you get into the movie, the more twisted it gets and everything that you think you know gets turned upside down. Once again, it makes you as disoriented as the character in the movie and that's a wonderful, original and confusing feeling. All of a sudden, sequences of mundane exposition become huge plot twists! I found ""Memento"" to be an extremely satisfying experience. It's so twisty, so intelligently written, so well acted and so well directed that it's the kind of movie that you can never forget once you've seen. I absolutely loved it and I'm very curious to see how it plays out a second time around, or if there is a way to view it in the ""correct"" order with some special edition blu-ray or DVD out there. I can't say enough good things about it. If you're interested in movies even a little bit, you should treat yourself by experiencing ""Memento"". (On Blu-ray, June 14, 2012)"

Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man who is struggling to put his life back together after the brutal rape and murder of his wife. But Leonard's problems are different from those of most people in his situation; he was beaten severely by the same man who killed his wife. The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; he is incapable of retaining any new information, and must resort to copious note- taking and Polaroid photographs in order to keep track of what happens to him over the course of a day (he's even tattooed himself with a few crucial bits of information he can't get along without). Leonard retains awareness that his wife was brutally murdered, however, and he's convinced that the culprit still walks the streets. Leonard is obsessed with the notion of taking revenge against the man who has ruined his life, and he sets out to find him, getting help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who appears to be a sympathetic barmaid, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who claims to be Leonard's friend, even though Leonard senses that he cannot be trusted.

","Christopher Nolan's Memento is not a normal film by any stretch of the imagination. It is one of the most confusing, purposely fragmented, hard to follow stories ever filmed. It is extremely hard to make sense of. But if you can follow it, the rewards are immense.<br/><br/>The basic premise is simple enough; a man seeks revenge for the death of his wife. But Leonard (Guy Pierce), the man in question, has no short term memory. And the scenes take place in reverse order, with each scene ending where the last scene started. The beginning is the ending, the ending is the beginning. And if that weren't enough, there's a second sequence of events which take place before the main story and are shown in chronological order, and the film constantly cuts back and forth between them. If you're confused at this point you should be; this is the kind of non-linear storytelling even most comic books won't touch.<br/><br/>When I say that Leonard has no short term memory, it means that anything that happens to him will be gone in a matter of minutes: faces, names, where he is, what he's doing. The only memories he has are those from before the injury that gave him his condition, the last of those being the death of his wife and the injury itself. This means that he, and by extension we, don't know anything about what's happening except what's scribbled on pieces of paper or tattooed to his body. And the real kick is that he doesn't know where or when he received any of this information, so there's no real way for him to know what, if anything is true.<br/><br/>And because the entire film moves backwards, we don't know how he or any of the other characters arrived at their present situations. We don't really know how long he's been hunting for the killer, why he came to this town, how he met the people who are helping him, or anything else. All we have is what we can infer from the beginning, (which is actually the ending) and I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that much of that will be completely wrong. The paradox of this movie is that we don't have any idea what's next because we don't know what came before, and what's next is what came before. And if you can make any sense out of what I've just said, good for you because that's more than I can say for myself.<br/><br/>Honestly, Memento almost makes Inception seem simple. The whole time you're watching you're aware that it doesn't seem to make any sense and that you don't know what's happening or why. But you keep watching because you want to understand. You're intrigued by Leonard and his quest for vengeance, and you want to know the answers. And whenever a question is answered another is posed, and every revelation throws what you think you know out the window. This movie is truly mind-bending in the very best sense of the word. And when you finally get to the ending (which is the beginning) you will be completely blown away by what you learn, and even more so by what is still in doubt.<br/><br/>Like I said, this is a weird one. It's fragmented, scrambled, incredibly complicated and at times borders on incomprehensible. But it raises as many important questions about the nature of memories and the human mind as the best psychology or philosophy lecture. And for the intelligent, strong stomached film-goer, it will all be worth it in the end. I would expect nothing less from Christopher Nolan."

","The most common criticism of this film is that it's ""hard to follow"" or ""too unconventional."" Well, that's exactly the point! The movie is intended to disorient the audience so that we feel the way the protagonist (Guy Pearce) feels with his short-term memory condition. After the opening of the film, it works its way backwards to show how we got to this point. Slowly, the entire plot is shown in flashbacks that reflect the character's 15-minute memory. There is also another ""timeline"" shot in black in white that happens in chronological order, a true showcase of Nolan's skill as a director. We learn that his wife was killed in a break-in that left him with a head injury leaving his long-term memory intact but unable to make ""new"" memories. He is bent on catching his wife's killer, which proves to be a difficult task given his condition. Before his memory resets, he takes annotated Polaroid's and tattoos himself with clues to which he is after, and what his situation is. However, this allows for him to be manipulated by those around him, and even himself. In his mostly positive review of the film, Roger Ebert seemed to discover a huge plot hole. How does he remember that he was short-term memory loss if the last thing he remembers is his wife's death? That seems like a legitimate observation that should discredit the film's cleverness. However, his memory of this is triggered by a tattoo on his hand of the name of another man (who becomes very important later) who had the same condition. Anyway where was I? Oh! ""Memento"" is a brilliant, mind-mending film that works both as a thriller and a psychological drama. It will undoubtedly receive very different interpretations from viewer to viewer (just like memories in real life). As the protagonist says: ""memories...they're just an interpretation, they're not a record."""

","Sorry for the bad English. This is my first review and i'm not a native speaker. <br/><br/>What makes this movie (and most of Nolan's movies) so strong is, that it combines an intelligent plot with a personal drama. It also shows, that the writers and the director want to serve cinematic demands as well as literary. It manages a symbiosis, that is, in my opinion, very hard to shoot.<br/><br/>The story itself is not that complicated. Leonard lost his wife and is out for her murderer. He has no short-term memory, what makes it almost impossible for him to be a good pathfinder, that's why he has a system to remember things, including notes, photos and tattoos.<br/><br/>This Story is told from the last scene to the first of chronological order. <br/><br/>Besides there is a chronologically told story of Leonard investigating against a man, who he thinks is a insurance fraudster.<br/><br/>At the end the two stories climax together as nothing is as it seemed. <br/><br/>I loved the backward storytelling so the recipient does not know more than the main character. beyond that the movie shows, which tricks our brain plays us to make us feel comfortable. At this point we see short story character, that never has been come to big screen before. (In my opinion)<br/><br/>The acting is good. Only the character Teddy is a bit overacted by Joe Pantoliano, but on the other hand it fits his role. <br/><br/>All in all I loved to sit in a scene and feel as uninformed as the main character.

","Memento is quite unlike any other film I've ever seen. It's about a guy who cannot create new memories trying to find his wife's killer. That alone is an interesting enough premise. But Christopher Nolan decided to take it even further by making the film go backwards. The film starts with the end, and goes to the beginning. So, right from the start, you know what the end result is, yet, you really don't know what happened. It manages to keep the viewer guessing and asking questions, despite already have given away the ending. That is some truly genius writing and directing on Nolan's part, once again demonstrating his immense talent. Every scene is positively dripping with mystery and suspense, and I can't remember the last time I was so riveted to the screen. This is probably Nolan's best film to date, and I strongly suggest you seek it out."

","From the dark, intellectual director Christopher Nolan, MEMENTO, written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, comes a psychological thriller. A crime driven who-did-what-to-whom. Suffering short-term memory, Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce), is determined to find the lowlife who murdered and raped his wife. ""Don't call me Lenny"" will have to use Polaroid snapshots of people and places, because of his head injury. He will even cover his body with tattoos with clues in desperation to jog his memory. Shelby, an ex-insurance investigator, will have to rely on his photos and some help from an abused waitress, Natalie(Carrie-Anne Moss)and a guy named Teddy(Joe Pantoliano), who is or isn't an undercover cop.

"melinda-brown1","9","0","2","17 November 2014"," Memento is a unique mystery thriller.
","Memento tells the story of a widower-Leonard (played by Guy Pierce) on a mission to find the (second) man responsible for raping and killing his wife. During the attack Leonard was brutally beaten which resulted in anterograde amnesia, a rare condition which prevents his brain from storing recent memories (short term memory loss). Leonard is able to piece together the details of his attack and journey by snapping polaroid's, writing himself notes, and tattooing important facts on his body, the most significant being ""John G. raped and murdered my wife."" As you can imagine this is perfect for paranoia, suspicion, uncertainty, confusion, and betrayal. And that's exactly what you get in extreme doses.<br/><br/>The sequence of this film is backwards. The opening scene is the climatic ending. Somehow Nolan was able to pull this off without spoiling or revealing one pertinent detail. Then it proceeds in two convergent narrative lines one from the present (backwards) and the other from the past (forward), untangling itself in brief snippets mirroring the forgetful condition of the tortured lead character. The audience, like Leonard, learns in fragments what's going on. Perfect for those who love to second guess what's going to happen, who's doing what and why.<br/><br/>Memento is a unique mystery thriller. The climax of the movie takes you off guard and you keep on thinking about the movie for days. You have to watch it at least twice to understand each and every scene and dialogue. The movie has a great concept, and an excitingly thorough storyline. If you like to sit back and relax, this film is a waste of time. It requires you to follow along, participate and fit puzzle pieces together. Memento doesn't provide any easy or obvious answers. A must see if you are looking for something clever and original."

","Haven't seen anything like this in my life, an insanely complex and breath-taking plot. Every moment of the movie is interesting and you can't stop constantly wondering what is going to happen next. Movie is made out of kinda fast clips, each clip helps to further understand the story and is crucial to fully get everything. The idea about tattoos and the way Leonard uses them is very great and is implemented perfectly into the movie. The beginning might be very misleading and somebody may already dislike the movie just because of its beginning. It all comes together at the end and if you pay close attention to everything you will be shocked and amazed by the depth and creativity of this movie. I love how this movie kinda starts from the end and ends with the beginning, that is something unique and rarely seen in the film industry.<br/><br/>The whole part of Leonard coming up with the story about Sammy and his disability just to somehow compensate his own painful life after tragedy, which his wife actually had survived and later on it turns out that he killed his own wife,hence failing her test. Doesn't matter what kind of movies you like, this movie is a must watch for anybody who likes movies that can make you think."
"ThomasDrufke","10","0","3","3 November 2014"," Memory Vs. Imagination
","It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has a neat way of presenting high concept ideas that all of us have thought about but not quite understood, and bringing them to the big screen in a highly entertaining way. Memento is quite possibly Nolan's most thought provoking film. It tells the story of a man who was injured during the murder of his wife and has short term memory loss. Only of course the film isn't told chronologically. It is told in two ways. The black and white scenes move forward but are of his past. While the color scenes are more present but are told backwards. When they meet we have the end. I have seen many films that take concepts like this and fail to truly entertain and are more artsy than audiences would like. Nolan mixed brain power with a unbelievably entertaining thriller.<br/><br/>Leonard's main goal is to find and kill his wife's killer, only with short term memory loss he has trouble remembering clues or even if he has already killed the man. He has tattoos to remind himself of his daily goals and who or who not to trust. While all this is going on, flashbacks tell the story of Sammy Jankis who suffered from the same disease as Leonard and supposedly kills his wife unwillingly because of it. The more and more the story progresses we begin to question everything we think we know about the character(s). As the color scenes are told subjectively we begin to find out more and more objective things once the scenes move backwards more. Where as we are told Leonards black and white scenes through an objective lens from a distance.<br/><br/>Nolan basically invents a new way of telling a story with this film and perfects it beautifully. It's really a story of memory versus imagination and how as we lose our memory we begin to paint our past with imagination and how we want to remember things. So Leonard may or may not fill in the gaps of his memory with what he wants to believe happened or not.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce gives an Oscar worthy performance in what should have been an all around award winning movie. From the writing to the editing to the directing to the haunting score, this film is a masterpiece and a true work of art that we just don't get often in film. Nolan combines art house directing with the utmost entertaining and engaging way to tell a story. I wont begin to try to explain the ending or go into true spoilers because this is a film you want to watch without knowing much and then go back and watch it right after. It's truly one of the most brilliant stories ever written and greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>+Inventive storytelling by the Nolan's <br/><br/>+Objective vs Subjective <br/><br/>+Memory vs Imagination <br/><br/>+Beginning is the end is the middle <br/><br/>+High concept yet highly entertaining <br/><br/>10/10"
"blazesnakes9","10","0","4","26 October 2014"," A smart, unique mystery thriller
","Leonard Shelby, (Guy Pearce), is a insurance investigator. He suffers from a condition that isn't short-term memory loss. Right before he lost his memory, his wife was killed by someone. He doesn't know who. But, he wants revenge. With the help of his memory condition and the notes tattooed on his arms, legs and body, Leonard is determined to figure out who killed his wife.<br/><br/>That's the set-up for Memento. This is a well made neo-noir thriller that plays with us by seeing through the eyes of a man who's determination only makes his investigation more superior. The movie is told through two story-lines. One story-line is told in black and white and the other is told in color. Director Christopher Nolan, who also serves as a screenwriter for this movie, challenges us to follow this mystery through two story-lines. The black and white scenes illustrates the story in chronological order. The color scenes takes place in reverse. As we watch this story unfold, Nolan reveals more and more of the mystery as he lets us get to know the facts before shifting gears.<br/><br/>Most thrillers today are jam-packed with predictable story-lines and endings. Memento is the complete opposite. This movie doesn't do any of those. Instead, what we have here is a complicated story about a complicated man. A man who's grief and guilt drives him through his investigation. That why Leonard is so important in this movie. Rather than showing us a straight-forward mystery with the clues being brought up in a linear story, Memento reveals clues from a non-linear story. This is the kind of movie that tells us a story that is based on a Hitchcockian level, but only in the 21st century. Without giving away too much of the ending, the conclusion is very effective in both wit and suspense.<br/><br/>The original story for this movie came from Christopher Nolan's younger brother, Johnathan. The movie is full of great performances by Guy Pearce and also from Joe Pantoliano. Pearce has been involved in the neo-noir genre before with L.A. Confidential. Unlike his role in that movie, Pearce brings out the grief in some of the movie's quiet scenes. There's are several moments during the movie where he lets us sympathizes with him while he copes with his condition. I thought that in those scenes, the movie stops short to shows us how Leonard feels about not remembering who he is and what he is. At that point, I felt pretty bad that he has to live with this condition and also solve his wife's murder.<br/><br/>I have seen good neo-noirs in my life. But, Memento is a rarity. You don't see movies like these being made everyday. As the audience, we are taken into the mind of a very confusing man. And when we learn about the facts, we sometimes feel as if we ourselves are spinning our heads because we can't keep up with this plot. That is what I like about movies. A lot of the great thrillers that we've seen over the years have made us think about ourselves as ordinary everyday people. It's movies like Memento that makes us think differently with ourselves so that we are caught up at the moment. This is a top-notch thriller that really deserves credibility for its story structure and the editing. This is a must-see. ★★★★ 4 stars."
"Red-Barracuda","10","0","4","10 October 2014"," Brilliant debut feature from Christopher Nolan
","Memento is of course famous for being a film whose narration is told in reverse. It's divided into several segments that go back progressively further in time; each is separated by black and white sequences told in the correct order. Eventually both dovetail together in a sequence at the end that reveals crucial details that inform the whole story. This unique structure is brilliant. It's far from a gimmick though, as it is an extremely effective way of putting the audience in the lead character Leonard's shoes. The reason for this is that he is a man with a rare short-term memory loss disease so he, like us in the audience, has no idea of what has happened just a short time before. He has to take Polaroids of important objects, write notes to himself and even apply tattoos in order to proceed through life with any purpose. The last thing he remembers is the brutal murder of his wife - in which he was also assaulted, leading to his condition – and it's an event he lives to get vengeance for.<br/><br/>The reverse order structure and memory problem of Leonard creates a very interesting and unusual tension. The film's plot is structured ingeniously so that events unfold in this reverse chronology in such a way that maximises the twists and turns of the story-line. One of the beauties of this type of narrative is that, like the main character, we also have to depend on his notes and so we never really know if friends really are friends and how long he has actually known anybody. It's a disorientating effect and the reverse chronology perfectly captures the confusion of it. Leonard is, therefore, a perfect example of one of the staples of literature – the unreliable narrator. Except in this case, what we see is fact, it's just that we interpret it via Leonard's self-made clues and we increasingly discover how flaky they are as the story progresses further into the past. The effect of the memory condition is often used for wildly differing ends; sometimes it's used comically, like where Leonard forgets if he is running away from or chasing after a mystery man or where he discovers by chance that he has been booked into two rooms in the motel he lives, while at other times it is used for intense drama, as in the powerful scene where Natalie abuses Leonard, which is a brilliant sequence that hits the audience hard and really illustrates the impossibility of Leonards predicament.<br/><br/>The cast helps a lot here. Guy Pearce shows again what a fantastic lead actor he can be, with a highly nuanced and varied performance as Leonard. Carrie-Anne Moss gets it spot on as the enigmatic femme-fatale, Natalie, while Joe Pantoliano is funny and shifty to the perfect degree as Teddy. But you really have to give the most credit to director Christopher Nolan, as this is really an extraordinarily assured debut movie. It remains easily the best thing he has ever done and the sheer audacity of attempting something so original for his first feature really indicated that he was someone with considerable talent. Memento is a neo-noir masterpiece and a towering achievement for all involved."
"kohehd","10","0","4","8 October 2014"," Thank You Nolan For Fixing The Metaphorical Cataracts Of Our Eyes
","I think that as Memento ages, it will become appreciated as one of best films ever made.<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly agree that it is presented in a fashion too confusing for most to enjoy with casual viewing, but consumers of the arts must understand that mass appeal serves to undermine what would otherwise be excellent experiences for the few to create mediocre experiences for the many. To produce something that will have any impact in the medium, you will have to depart from convention. I am not saying it has to be elitist or esoteric in any way, but that people have preferences and forsaking artistic expression to cater to as many tastes as possible is the slippery slope to mediocrity.<br/><br/>Though I (and many others) believe Memento is presented in a manner that casual viewers will not enjoy, I do not presume that they are incapable of appreciating it. I feel that as film culture matures with young generations of internet film pirates growing up on easily accessible movies, timeless films like Groundhog Day and Memento will eventually attain the reverence they truly deserve.<br/><br/>Memento also has a clear interpretation (unlike say... Mulholland Drive or Enemy) that is easy to derive, though not without effort. It is far from being pretentious in that once you understand the presentation, the reasons for it become manifestly clear. (If I'm sounding snobby or mystical here, it is because I'm trying to avoid spoilers, I hope)<br/><br/>Memento is indubitably Christopher Nolan's finest work and will, I suspect, remain so for many, many years to come.<br/><br/>Thank you Ser Han for prompting me to do this."

","A decent storyline, brilliant characters, and a fantastic climax that will keep you guessing until you go online and look for those blogs saying ""Memento explained"". That's what makes Memento one of the best innovations ever on celluloid, if you exclude some of the other marvels by the same director. If I were to say that memento keeps you glued, it wouldn't be quite appropriate. Indeed, Christopher Nolan tries his best to lose the viewer by a series of scenes that run backwards in time rather than forward; giving the storyline a dramatic twist that totally muddles with your grey matter. Further, the scenes running backwards are interspersed with scenes from a parallel storyline that is actually running forwards; this storyline meeting the other storyline (that's running backwards) in the last scene of the movie.<br/><br/>The protagonist here, Leonard Pierce suffers from short-term memory loss and is unable to form new memories consequently forgetting anything that happened more than 15 minutes ago. He has mastered the art of creating tattoos and notes to help him figure out where he is, what he's doing, who are his friends, and who're not. He's on a quest to identify and kill the man who murdered his wife, the murder being the last event in his memory.<br/><br/>By running the movie backwards, Nolan puts you in Leonard's shoes, since at every scene you begin with no knowledge of what happened before that scene. Brilliant, eh? The characters interacting with Leonard are kind of fuzzy and mysterious, since you don't really know who they are or what are their intentions. Multiple unpredictable twists and revelations make this movie a real gripper.<br/><br/>Go watch Memento in the theaters. Watch it again on DVD to understand it. 9/10 for me."

","Christopher Nolan's Memento is a great exercise for our concentration and perceptions while watching a film, also, a proof of his geniality. I only wish we had more films like this among ""mainstream"" cinema, not only huge budget action flicks. This film is one of a kind, one that actually makes you think outside the box, even after it's over, producing waves that go a long way. It's also that kind of movie that, every time you watch it, there's something new to discover. The great special thing about it is the reversed order of events, meant to make us feel as disoriented as Leonard. We are dared to put the pieces together and try to make some sense out of that fragmented story, but easy answers are never given.<br/><br/>As always happens to great movies like this, lots of theories surround what is supposed to be the ""truth"". But, similar to real life, there simply isn't one and only truth, there are points of view, and our own choices. As for Lenny's story, we have some facts (but even facts can turn into memories, if we dig deep enough), and what was once taken as a central belief can be twisted upside down. <br/><br/>To me, one of the great things about it is the final monologue, showing how much of what we tell ourselves can be a most conventional lie. We lie to ourselves not only for our own benefit over others, but especially in order to survive. To survive a truth that is so much greater than us that it contains the power to annihilate our existence. And if we believe what Teddy says to Lenny in the final (but first) scene, we may have a lot figured out about what Lenny is all about. I chose to believe that interpretation, but of course, the discussion is never over. Doubts always remain, and in a story as rich as this, anything is possible."

When you watch a film you always are eager to see what happens next, you may have an idea about what may happen next, but you are still interested in seeing it. This film is the opposite, it makes you anticipate or interpret what had happened earlier. This movie moves in a reverse chronological order. It was done to make us see the movie from Leonard (Guy Pearce)'s perspective, as his character is suffering from Short Term Memory loss and has no idea what he is doing in a couple of minutes and has no idea what he did before. In normal films there is a room for interpretation because they are in a chronological order, this film however leaves you in a black hole and the further you get into the movie, the more you will be able to connect the missing movies.<br/><br/>The film has two different sequences one sequence is thew story unfolding in reverse order, the other scenes are the black and white documentary scenes which are slow but give the film a realistic feel and make you understand what is in the mind of Leonard Shelby. And by the end both these sequences intersect.<br/><br/>That is what is so brilliant about Memento, it makes you heavily think, invests you in the movie, makes you solve a puzzle, much like the puzzle the main character Leonard's is trying to solve. And by the end you will be able to join most of the missing pieces together. The movie also ends on a brilliant note as it leaves you thinking and leaves a lot of room for interpretation, about what happened. This will make you want to talk about this movie and thinking about it even after you have watched it. <br/><br/>The replay value is also good, some scenes are so fantastic that you can watch again and again mainly the Teddy scenes which have excellent and funny dialog. The movie can also be watched from different perspectives, you can watch the movie in it's normal chronological order, which is not recommended because it ruins the fun. And you can also watch this movie based on the interpretation that Leonard's is trying to solve an unsolvable puzzle and that he is deluded person trying to escape reality. <br/><br/>The storyline is not that amazing but it is the way it is told, like a puzzle is what makes it so great. The whole storyline remains a mystery till most of the movie unfolds. Acting wise this film is fantastic. Guy Pearce is fantastic in his role as Leonard Shellby, not only he is excellent to watch all the scenes, and he gets all the screen time and makes most of it. Leon's character was also brilliantly return how do you make a character with short term memory loss work, you give him notes photographs and tattoos to remember things so that he is not completely handicapped. Carrie Annie Moss gets little screen time but she does a great job in the amount of screen time she gets , many of her scenes with Pierce are actually fantastic. That leaves Joe Pantoliano who is fantastic in his role as teddy, his dialog delivery and humor is fantastic and he is extremely charismatic every-time he is on the screen he demands your attention. Some of his dialogs are the best in the entire movie. <br/><br/>The soundtrack and the music also perfectly match the neo-noir atmosphere and environment of this film<br/><br/>This is one of the older films of Christopher Nolan, and only shows how great his style is and how brilliant is direction. This movie which one of the earliest films Nolan made gives Nolan's other blockbuster films, the Dark Knight trilogy and Inception a great run for it's money. Do yourself a favor and watch Memento is a fantastic film and that will mesmerize, and once it is over you still be talking about and thinking about it fro a long time, that's how brilliant this film is.<br/><br/>Overall Rating 10/10."

","This is one of those movies that keeps you guessing until the end. It follows a non-linear pattern in storytelling, which has a similar pace to such great films as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Mulholland Drive"". Not trying to compare those two to this, I'm just saying that the way it weaves between the time-line gives it a strikingly familiar resemblance.<br/><br/>What's the story? Leonard Shelby is a man who's out for vengeance. His wife was murdered and suffered a head injury to save her from her death. This head trauma resulted in him not being able to make new memories, while still recalling past occurrences prior to his accident. He lives in a hotel room, trying to figure out how to find his wife's killer). To remember, Leonard writes down notes and takes pictures. As this plays out, we ponder if this condition is psychological or solely just a physical consequence of his state of mind.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil anything, but I will say that by the end, we figure out the truth behind his wife's death and who real killed her. Mr. Nolan has done an amazing job at keeping the audience guessing in suspense, very methodical and quite effective. Watch it and put the puzzle together yourself!"

","A man (Guy Pearce), suffering from short-term memory loss, uses notes and tattoos to hunt for the man he thinks killed his wife.<br/><br/>Although Christopher Nolan had previously made ""Following"" and a short film, this was easily the film that catapulted him to worldwide success, landed him the Batman franchise, and made him one of the greatest directors working today. Although it may not be a fair assessment, the fact almost every one of his films has been in the Top 100 on IMDb suggests he has a magic touch not seen since the days of Kubrick or Hitchcock.<br/><br/>This was also a great role for Pearce. He has been known for ""The Time Machine"", ""LA Confidential"", and more recently ""Iron Man 3"", but I think he will always be remembered for ""Memento"". He was, after all, the driving force behind the film in the acting department, appearing in basically every scene and conveying a wide range of emotions... the fact Pearce is not one of the highest-paid actors in the world is a bit unfortunate, because he can hold his own with the likes of Christian Bale and Daniel Day-Lewis."
"InsainJ","8","0","2","26 March 2014"," Memento, as complex as it can get.
","This movie has been praised by a lot of people on the internet. But my question is: is it really a 10 star-movie or has it been over-hyped?<br/><br/>Memento is a movie about Leonard, a man with severe memory loss. He tries remembering things by photos and putting notes all over the place even tattoos on his body. Christopher Nolan tries to confuse the audience in a way just like Leonard is confused by his amnesia. He uses two separate story lines, the first goes back in time and the second one travels forward in time, the 2 alternate continuously. Actually you can follow the story quite well but it's weird and this is still a unique kind of storytelling although the movie was released back in 2000. <br/><br/>Guy Pierce does a great job playing the confused Leonard, you really pity him when he is being fooled by some obscure characters like Natalie. Carrie-Ann Moss plays that bitch in a credible way, which makes you like Leonard just that bit more. The actors in general are not extraordinary, more like good. Unlike Christopher Nolan and his editing team which I really admire for their superb performance, they are the real stars of the movie. For Instance: Something odd happens in the one story line and the when the other story line is happening you can connect things that are taking place to that odd event.(Even describing this movie is complicated) It's incredible how they can make such a complex format 'understandable' towards the audience. But it's still quite hard to fully understand the movie, especially the ending. Most people (like me) will not fully understand it, you have to watch an explanation video or watch Memento again. Probably this was on purpose, but in my opinion this is something negative.<br/><br/>There's plenty of action for a movie of the mystery genre. If you liked Inception or Shutter Island, you will definitely find this one interesting. But I prefer those over Memento just because the acting was better. Leonardo DiCaprio was the star in both so it's not really surprising. If you want some light entertainment you should rather watch The Expendables or Harry Potter, which are nice in their own ways.<br/><br/>So is it a 10 star movie? As you have probably already seen: No. It's a great movie and It has some unique aspects. But it also has some flaws like the ending and one or two times I was a bit bored. Because of these 2 flaws I give it 8 stars. This is still a good rating and the movie deserves it.<br/><br/><ul><li>Jonas De Maeseneer</li></ul>"

","Before watching this film I was aware that it was shown in reverse chronological order. I was not keen on this also knowing that it was coming from the director of the Dark Knight and Inception, which while they are good films I do not hold them in as high regard as others that i have watched seeing as most of his more recent works aim towards purely entertainment instead of the art of cinema. However I was left in awe of this movie and realized how perfect the choice of showing the film in reverse actually was. Leonard's condition leaves him chronically unaware of how he gets places and what he's doing. By presenting the film starting with Teddy's death at Leonard's hand Nolan is able to leave the audience with the same feeling because they are unaware of what Leonard is doing at the beginning of each scene as well as how he has gotten there. I'm not sure where in the planning process that this decision was made, but it without a doubt changed the chemistry of this movie and took it from what would have been your run of the mill neo- noir crime film to an icon for future films to aspire."

"yourfriend_ap","10","0","2","18 February 2014"," Memento: A movie that needs to be seen in reverse. !
","The problem with being on a quest and having only short-term memory is that you can easily forget that you just finished what you started to do. Even though Leonard uses a system of Polaroid photos and tattoos to keep track of what he's doing, it's up to him to record whatever he considers important. At the moment of making a snap judgment, if he fails to find a pen, or if he's out of film, or if he just choose to not record the information, then he's out of luck.<br/><br/>The movie starts by showing Leonard killing someone, and it is soon hinted that this person might be the killer Leonard was seeking. The movie traces Leonard's steps backwards to try to illustrate the logic Leonard uses in making his decision. In doing so, the movie also recants the story, in chronological order, of Sammy (Stephen Tobolowsky), a person who Leonard investigated for insurance fraud and who suffered from the same condition as Leonard does, and how their wives (Leonard's and Sammy's) apparently meet their demise. This happens gradually and for the most part, both stories are very clear cut (which means it's too good to be true). The most damning revelations are made during the final minutes of the film, which illustrates the nature of Leonard's condition, as well as his circular quest (the tag-line gives a major clue: ""some memories are best forgotten"").<br/><br/>While some people think of the movie as being rather ambiguous, I believe there are enough pointers to solve most issues (just view the movie backwards). For example, Leonard, our protagonist, is allegedly helped by Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who seems like a good person. However, towards the end, she issues a tirade which makes it clear exactly what her real motives are. The final sequences are the most telling, where another person who Leonard isn't supposed to trust, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), tells him what is really happening since he has been with Leonard since the beginning of his quest. Leonard's reaction to Teddy's ""truth"", and a failure to record it, illustrates the motivations behind his actions.<br/><br/>The movie's style of telling the story backward is interesting, but I'm beginning to discover that it's really not that hard to tell a story in this manner. Take a few your favorite books (or even this review), reverse all the chapters/paragraphs, and with a bit of mental filler, you can easily follow the stories in most cases.<br/><br/>Director Christopher Nolan has made a memorable film in Memento, which serves as a metaphor for forgetting everything we hold dear when humans embark on a quest and want to succeed at any cost. Don't miss this film. AWESOME!!!<br/><br/>PLOT A backwards sequence is shown. It starts with the Polaroid photograph of a dead man. As the sequence plays backwards the photo reverts to its undeveloped state, entering the camera before the man is shot in the head. This is followed by interspersed black-and-white and color sequences, with the black-and-white sequences taking place chronologically before the color sequences."

","After watching this movie several of time, I found out that Christopher Nolan's greatest mystery movie is actually too simple that its hard for anyone to solve it perfectly. It's like a Paradox. and there is the greatest trick of the director that in order to solve the puzzle of this movie, you have to watch this again and again. According to my view, i can only say that if this movie is a ""fill in the blank"" type puzzle, then if you put that thing in blank mind that ""The main character of the movie actually can remember everything at-least more than a normal person, and his so called friend is a habituated liar."" then there is a chance that you can solve it. that's all."

"StevePulaski","9","0","2","7 November 2013"," She deserves vengeance, regardless if he knows or not
","Before Christopher Nolan began mixing the spectacle and the narrative device, along with the real show of characters and eccentric personalities. With the recent Batman franchise, Nolan became more about the darkness aspect of the story and noticeably amplified the action spectacle, but with his directorial debut Memento, he was all about the mystery. Memento is a great film mainly because of its element of surprise, mystery, and its narrative device. Nolan conducts the story atypically from the end of the story all the way to the beginning, focusing on an array of characters that may or may not have anything to do with the outcome of the story. But is the outcome the first scene (the story's conclusion) or the final scene (the story's beginning)? That is one of the many questions you'll ask yourself when watching Memento for the first time. Seeing it for the first time, I wasn't prepared for the constant mind-race I'd be experiencing. The plot should not be spoiled, so I'll give basic the story's basic framework. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from a memory disorder after a man apparently attacked and murdered his wife before knocking him unconscious. Now, Leonard wants to avenge his wife's death, but his memory loss makes it more of a challenge than it already is. Leonard can't hold onto newer memories but has all the ones prior to the incident. To keep with the information about his attacker, Leonard tattoos himself with crucial information in his search for the murderer and takes many Polaroids of the people he meets along the way.<br/><br/>That's as far as I'll go in trying to sum up the plot. If you haven't seen it, you don't need to know much else. The story, being told backwards to forwards, intrigues and mystifies, as it should, and heightens the mystery of the entire premise. However, I question the impact the film will have with repeated viewings. Seeing it once and exploring the ins-and-outs of online movie-guides and analyses for Memento, I am seriously skeptical about it being as exhilarating and as gripping as it was the first time around.<br/><br/>Despite my speculation of whether or not Memento will hold up for a second viewing, the film should be commended for its intrigue and intricate use of characters and story development. Sometimes the value of characters' motives - and characters themselves - are questionable, making the film tricky to piece together. This is not a criticism because it makes you connect with the stress and confusion of Leonard. The whole thing is akin to a hazy, vigilante/detective story. Nolan puts us in the position of Leonard so deeply that there's hardly a frame or scene where he isn't there. This gives us the feeling of confinement; the odd and often eerie feeling of embodying a character in a film.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce's enticing performance only levies this. Pearce adds the hazy and disoriented qualities of Leonard's character subtly but effectively as she makes the character sympathetic but simultaneously unreliable. With Leonard's severe condition, even his buddy Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) sometimes seems like a complete stranger. This not only leads to an unreliable narrator, but an unreliable cast of characters, seeing as Leonard feels as if he can't trust his own friends and acquaintances due to his condition. The same applies to us.<br/><br/>Memento is a great thriller thanks to its mystery and high-levels of intrigue. The great performances of Pearce, Pantoliano, and Carrie Anne-Moss as a woman Leonard meets during his search. The scene that rings in my head the most from the film is when Teddy informs Leonard that even if he does kill the person responsible, it isn't like he'll remember it. Leonard has the most logical response there could be. ""My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make a difference whether I know about it."" <br/><br/>Starring: Guy Peace, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Anne-Moss. Directed by: Christopher Nolan."
"Floated2","10","0","4","31 October 2013"," Mindblowing Thriller
","Memento a film that needs multiple viewings. Memento not only warrants second, third and more viewings but actively encourages them. Like ""The Usual Suspects"" you get to the end and think you have found the answer to what happened, what you have just spent two hours watching, but the more you analyse it the less certain you are. You really will end up thinking ""Now, where was I?"" Characters' moral ambiguity become clearer with each viewing so that you can end up convinced that everyone in the world is totally messed up and utterly lacking a morality of any real kind.<br/><br/>Pearce makes another great screen character come to life off the script (see ""LA Confidential"" and ""Priscilla"" for others), Joe Pantoliano is a creature of demonlike charm, and Carrie Moss. Her role as Natalie is pivotal to the audience's realisation that this movie is deliberately playing with their head.<br/><br/>There are very few films that offer an experience as engrossing as this, although it's not for everyone. If you're the kind of person that likes to work things out for yourself using the available evidence (just like Leonard) then this is for you. If you like your movies to be clear cut and easy to understand on the original viewing, this may not be to your taste. As a rewatch 03/13/20' Memento remains one of the greater films as it is complex and at times hard to follow, but once understood, this film is a great piece of cinema."

Nevertheless, he desperately tries to find out who killed his wife and made him mentally disabled. So he writes notes on everything, from photos to his body in order to remember the facts Because it doesn't matter what he thinks, it's the details written down that counts There are other people, though, trying to abuse this deficiency of him <br/><br/>The movie is directed by the maker of Inception and the Batman trilogy- and we have to mention that it is better than the 4 movie altogether, as this was the movie which have made Christopher Nolan famous, and maybe so thought the jury of the Academy Award as they nominated the film for Best Film Editing and Best Screenplay.<br/><br/>We have to mention Guy Pearce, who give a memorably performance as Leonard, the main character. I also liked the camera work and, of course, the directing, which is basically to have control over all aspects of the filmmaking. <br/><br/>My only criticism is the language being used in one scene of the film, but it is reasonable because of the plot. Why this movie is amusing is that it has two story lines. One storyline moves forward in time while the other tells the story backwards revealing more each time. It's a dark thriller with an interesting question: Is a man guilty of what he did if he doesn't remember why he did them? <br/><br/>All in all, Memento is an interesting, challenging film with an intricate plot, and I guarantee you that it will fix you in your chair for its 113 min length"

It transcends beauty and normal patterns of rational thought, and, sadly, there may never be another film like it.<br/><br/>I urge you to watch this with mature friends and colleagues in a quiet setting to minimize distraction, as it is quite hard to follow even for mature audiences. <br/><br/>By its ending monologue, Memento will make you question what motivates you in life, and it is a splendid and terrible question to ponder. <br/><br/>Simply put: one of the greatest works of our generation."

","It sets off with a murder from the look of which, the protagonist of the movie kills the guy who's raped and got it over with his wife. The look of satisfaction and enthusiasm on his face implies that he's gotten his revenge and will live relieved after this, but you can never say that as there is no afterward events; the story enjoys a reverse chronology. In a story employing this technique, the first scene shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.<br/><br/>This 2000 Christopher Nolan movie which is made well before Batman trilogy, The Prestige, and Inception, is based on a short story from Johnathan Nolan, the outstanding director's brother who has been the co- screenwriter for Nolan's other great works as well. All the first scenes are happening after the next one and just come to an end when the other one starts which is as strange on paper as it looks on the screen! Nonetheless, this is not the most moving factor in the movie as it is about to get even creepier. The main character of the story, Leonard Shelby (personalized by Guy Pearce) has lost his short memory in the unfortunate incident in a fight with the jerk raping his love. He would only keep the stuff going around him in his recollection for less than ten minutes. To remember things by, he has developed this taking pictures plus adding notes under them method. He usually carries a camera around and takes pictures from the people and places to have in his pocket which will be his only tool to judge people on their good and bad nature. It does not often pay off as the man would choose to write notes about people at the wrong time. <br/><br/>Besides, Lenny has developed the habit of getting tattoos on his body about very important facts and information. The numbers of tattoos increase constantly, but never stop. The main character, who remembers to be a psychologist, usually talks of a Sammy Jackson which the viewer can never be certain of its existence which is the most terrifying fact. The movie leaves the viewer holding the bag and awing at the heaviness of a 2-hour backward story. It educates you that you can never judge people based on one situation, teaches you that even short term memory is a full blessing, and shows you that everything could start only when you think they've come to a bitter end. <br/><br/>There it is: Christopher Nolan's weirdly overwhelming haunting movie that will make your jaw drop and leave you asking ""what did I just watch?"""

I have watched the movie multiple times because I never tire of the complexity and originality of the picture. Few films can match the impact of Memento, the film etches itself in your mind as a unique experience that clenches you instantly and doesn't release you until the end credits roll. This film should be in the top 10, to have the film in the top 50 isn't high enough for it. Memento is on par with seven, usual suspects, pulp fiction, the matrix , the shawshank redemption, the prestige, American psycho, American history x, Fight Club, Face/Off, The Devil's advocate, Heat, Casino which also should be in the top 30 it is underrated in its position as with heat, The Sixth Sense, Shutter Island should be in the top 30 as well the twist is brilliant. I rate all of these films 10 but some of them will probably not receive the true credit they deserve as being a real classic. I have personally seen over 500 films in my life so far and all of these films include great casts, great tales and top notch special effects.

","The very thing that Hollywood most lacks nowadays is originality. In an era where we are constantly being repetitively served with remakes, re-creations, prequels and, not to forget, interminable sequels, creativity surely does not seem to be the main and most essential factor in the vast majority of nowadays films. Hollywood seems like a movie bakery that counts on the same recipe book with certain ingredients over and over again to produce an edible cake to serve. Not to mention tons of explosions, gunfights, and long list of visual effects artists that seem to fill most of today's films. However, there can be exceptions, but they come in small quantities, and at very rare times. One of those exceptions is Christopher Nolan's Memento. ""You need three things to make a good movie: a good script, a good script and a good script."" (Alfred Hitchcock) Christopher Nolan, who both wrote and directed the film, has successfully proved that his work in Memento is an application of how great a script filled of twists and turns with a non-linear narrative structure applied in reverse, meaning that we get to see the latter events of the story unfold at the beginning of the film, can distinct Memento to be one of the phenomenal film ever made."

The film was a very good but not unworthy to reflection. He was just't like the last delicious morsel. Eaten with pleasure, but then forgotten. But of course he deserves all the awards and high places. The biggest plus here was the original script that was not a banal. ""We all lie to ourselves to be happy."" And end. I think not everyone understood it. It's not as simple as if the end of the film which begins and explain everything. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, just watch again. ""If we can't make memories, we can't heal"""

","I rarely like the movie I watched because most movies are crap. And even if I do I am rarely impressed by it. I liked Man of Steel a lot, but I am not particularly shattered by it. ""Memento"" is a piece of art, a unique and monumental movie which is a must watch in every aspect. Its story is touching and simple in nature. However it is twisted to such extent that by the end you can barely fit it all together in your head at the end. Guy is as best as he can get. The music is fantastic as is every other part of the movie. It all fits together perfectly. A movie that has more to say each time you see it. A masterpiece, no doubt.

","Wow! What a movie I regret not seeing Memento a long time ago. It was so fascinating! Memento tells the story of Leonard, a man suffering from short-term memory loss after a tragic incident in which his wife was raped and killed. To cope with his condition, Leonard takes Polaroid pictures, writes himself notes and tattoos himself with reminders and instructions that help him on his quest to find and kill the man who killed his wife. What is so remarkable about Memento, other than the unique plot line, is that the story is told in reverse. The movie begins with Leonard killing a man named Teddy and concludes with the events that happened days beforehand.<br/><br/>I've never seen a movie quite like this! Just the fact that it unfolds in reverse is amazing to me. It created a level of suspense unlike anything else. I actually only intended to watch about 30 minutes of it before bed and watch the rest the next day. I couldn't turn it off though! It kept me on pins and needles as I waited to find out some unknown truth about Leonard and his condition. Memento did not disappoint!<br/><br/>Other than the riveting plot and structure of the movie, the way it was shot was brilliant. Segments in color were interspersed with black and white segments in which we see Leonard in a hotel room on the phone telling someone about his condition. It gave an intimate look into the psyche of this very damaged man. Guy Pearce was perfection! I was thoroughly impressed with his acting in Memento.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this film! Christopher Nolan struck gold with Memento; if you haven't seen it yet, please do!"

","Memento is an amazing movie in my opinion. It may not be one of the greatest of all time, but its still VERY VERY good.<br/><br/>These days pretty much every idea for a movie has already been taken. I mean there are millions of movies out there. So of course you're going to see movies play off of each other all the time. I'm sure Memento can be found in many movies that have come before it but I didn't find it to be some horrible, cheap imitation and repetitious.<br/><br/>Some people complain that this movie was too confusing and that there were too many plot holes.<br/><br/>The whole genius of this movie and what makes it different from most that I've watched lately is you have to get inside this movie. You can't just view it from the surface only giving half you attention to it or it defiantly won't make sense. This means you may even have to watch it more than once but trust me it all comes together.<br/><br/>Now if you don't like having to play detective while you watch a movie I wouldn't suggest it but never the less it's a good movie.<br/><br/>And as for the plot holesI don't pay any attention to them. I rather enjoy a movie then analyze everything that's wrong with it. I do have to agree that its probably not top ten material because I'm positive there's ten other movies that overrate it but I believe it rates pretty high up there.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 easy"
"thewillt08","8","0","2","18 June 2013"," A Risk That Paid Off
","Every now and then you come across a movie where you are almost literally glued to the screen. This is basically what happened when I watched Memento. I went into this movie dry. I didn't know much about it other than it is about a man with memory loss and he tries to avenge his wife. That is basically the story but it sort of plays backwards. I watched this movie on recommendation by a few friends and when I heard Christopher Nolan was involved I was sold. Without further ado here is Memento.<br/><br/>Like I said the story is kind of backwards. The movie starts with a lot of confusion but as the scenes progress a few questions get answered with even more questions. The big overall question is, who killed Leonard wife and who is responsible for the situation he is in? Leonard is a husband out for revenge but has severe short term memory loss. We are introduced to a lot in the first few scenes including Trinity form the Matrix and the bald guy from Baby's Day Out. <br/><br/>As the story unfoldswe understand their importance and the story slowly starts to makesense. The only flaw I see in the movie is that it really drags and thebeginning is very slow. I wanted to watch the entire movie but it took me a little while to get into it and really into the story. To make it even worse I paused it to go to the bathroom and before I did I thought the movie would be wrapping up soon. Little did I know I was only about an hour into it with a little over an hour left. I did enjoy the movie once I got into it but it felt like I was watching it for six hours. The characters themselves were nothing short of hit or miss. The unpredictability of them was what I enjoyed the most. Leonard was a little bland but it made sense because he was always confused. Obviously he was confused because he suffers from memory loss so his simplicity was expected. He has tattoos all over his body and writes things down on pictures so he remembers what happened the day before. It is really a brilliant idea and we see the severity of his obsession on finding the man responsible for everything. Natalie started out as a really strong character I really enjoyed but there was one scene where I really didn't expect her to do what she did. That was where she takes advantage of Lenny. It was really unexpected but I thought that whole scene was great and it made the story that much clearer. My favorite character in the entire movie is Teddy. I love the actor, I think he is very underrated but fits best as a secondary role rather than a star. His actions are unclear because on the back of his photo it says ""don't believe his lies"" so his intentions are unclear. It is another huge question throughout the movie. He randomly appears everywhere always advising Lenny to leave town. He is always involved in some way and he does an amazing job in dragging me into the story. Once I got into the story I was stuck in place and I wasn't going anywhere. Throughout the story there are a bunch of scenes in black and white where Leonard is on the phone telling a story about Sammy. The big question in my mind is how it was relevant to the story but I liked those scenes a lot better than any others. Maybe I liked the psychological aspect of memory loss and in these scenes we dive deep into the condition and the character of Leonard himself. This is where he shows his colors as a normal person and the type of man he was. If you see this movie and are bored with the chain of events and how it constantly backtracks take my advice, stick with it. The ending to this movie is mind blowing and what I really love about movies. Movies can play with your mind and make you believe one thing so strongly then completely switch it up in a matter of minutes. The final scenes to this movie answer everything and it all makes sense. We see the true intentions of each character and we get resolution in the story and it was very satisfying. I was thinking how I would have liked to see everything in order but if I did I probably would have hated the movie. Overall, Memento is a unique movie with an interesting enough premise to make me sit though the drag of the first act. I loved the black and white affect and the writing of the story. Christopher Nolan was involved so I had high hopes and he did not disappoint. The characters were good for the most part. I would have liked to see a little more form a few but the movie dragged enough as it was. The second act was a lot better than the first and the third blew me away. The acting was good for the most part, no Oscar worthy performances but it did get the job done. The ending did save this movie from being a wreck because if that failed then all the events prior would have been for nothing and a waste of time. Memento gets the WillyT Recommendation for its uniqueness and originality. The risk taken in the movie did pull off and is something I could easily watch again and probably should so I can make sense if it completely."

"Lejink","8","0","2","5 August 2012"," Memento more!
","Christopher Nolan's breakthrough film displays in full his originality in choice of subject and bravura style. ""Memento"" starts and ends with different murders (or does it?), keeping the viewer engrossed and always on the hop with its forward and backward time-frames, not to mention contrasting colour and monochromatic cinematography.<br/><br/>Brilliantly edited and skilfully acted the film demands complete attention from first to last, or is that last to first, as Guy Pearce's haunted Lenny tries to rebuild his memories and uncover the truth about the rape and murder of his wife. The jump-cuts each time he goes back further in his flashbacks jolt like one waking from a dream and yet build a rhythm to the movie which takes away the viewer's initial expectations as to when his next recurrence will crop up. <br/><br/>Just occasionally the disparate characters and the interlocking story lost me and I'm not completely sure I got the ending but up until that point I was in thrall for most of the time as Nolan presents us with a brilliant twist on film noir, as Pearce's insurance investigator (acting for all the world like a private investigator) finds himself embroiled in a convoluted murder mystery. <br/><br/>Pearce is excellent in the lead, but the rest of the cast are excellent in support in what I imagine must have been a confusing shoot. After a run of excellent original thrillers in the late 80's ""The Usual Suspects"", ""LA Confidential"" ""Se7en"", ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", it was going to take something very good to continue the new tradition.<br/><br/>For the most part however Nolan delivers and as his subsequent track record shows, it was no fluke"

","I always enjoy a great mind boggling film;'Memento' is one of the best ever. Christopher Nolan incorporates a sophisticated plot that you never know where you're going throughout the movie unless you pay close attention to the events that occur in the film. What grabs my attention is the mystery of how the plot unfolds surrounding Leonard's explanation of how he came to murder Teddy, but is what he saying really the truth? The answer is that we don't know since there is no reliable narrator to verify our suspicions or tell us what really happened. The reason is because LEONARD IS THE NARRATOR and he wants to believe that his actions are just and that his story about how his wife died and he got his 'condition' is the truth. But that is for the viewer to decide as he or she actually watches the film."

","'Memento' is quite a confusing film which takes a little bit of time to make sense. It can be quite difficult to understand initially because the film doesn't play out in the correct order, you're finding out different pieces of the story at different times and you slowly begin to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>It's very clever; to film this and break it up to portray it in a mixed up order must be really difficult and Christopher Nolan has done a great job. The script is really good; a film like this can make it really easy to make mistakes and he's done a great job in making sure the story makes sense. The story itself is really interesting and the way in which it has been filmed reflects Leonard's mindset. <br/><br/>The acting performances (of which there is really only three) are pretty good. Guy Pearce performs really well in this; his character involves a wide range of emotions and he portrays most of them really well, sometimes his dialogue can be a bit wooden but it never lasts long enough to have a negative effect on the film. Joe Pantoliano also does a good job here - he plays his ambiguous character really well. The worst performance of the three is Carrie-Anne Moss; she doesn't really have an impact on the film and some scenes where her character plays a crucial role in a scene she fails to evoke enough emotion to convince viewers. <br/><br/>The film overall is really good, you never quite manage to determine the ending until it actually occurs and the ending is excellent. There are a lot of films where half-way through you can guess the ending correctly but this is not the case with 'Memento', really worth a watch especially if you have seen any of Christopher Nolan's previous films."

","Sometimes, it's the way you tell 'em. Such is true of Christopher Nolan's Memento. Based on a short story brother by Jonanthan Nolan, the film is both inventive and compelling as it tells it's story in small chapters moving backwards through the narrative. This editing style is unique to the point that you really feel as though you are witnessing something that has never been done before. The story itself is very simple, the execution is a work of sheer excellence. Guy Pearce is Leonard Shelby, a man who through personal tragedy has lost the ability to create new memories beyond ten minutes and has to to keep detailed records of everything he does in order to function. Early on we learn the catalyst for Leoonard's memory dysfunction was the murder of his wife. Through tattooed notes inked over most of his body, Leonard is slowly gathering clues as to who her killer may be. Christopher Nolan's film is an intimate experience that stays thoroughly focused as the details gradually unravel. In many ways it's the closest equivalent to a compelling page turner as you find yourself eagerly awaiting the next chapter and slice of information. That intimate focus really allows the viewer to become involved in the mystery and gives you ample opportunity within to play detective yourself. With a production budget of just $9m Memento a triumph of intelligent, low budget film making from a director and creative team that were clearly destined for greatness."

","I always do reviews according to some connection with another film coming out the year I do it. In other words since TDKR is coming out in a week (I got tickets to it in IMAX!), I would like to go through some of Nolan's films. I consider this (and so will many) to be his best.<br/><br/>The Batman films and Inception were brilliant as well but they were made with large budgets. Low budget films tend to be more focused. They use clever filmmaking techniques, a non-ensemble cast, and tend to let the story keep us captivated.<br/><br/>Most of us know the story. It follows a man, Leonard, who can't make new memories, who tries to find his wife's killer using Polaroids and information tattooed to his body.<br/><br/>It's presented in a non-linear format. The events are given to us in reverse order giving us a sense of the Leonard's condition. When the events unfold you truly get to see what his intentions are.<br/><br/>This is what makes it Nolan's most thought provoking film. The thing with Inception and The Dark Knight is that their issues don't have much gravity when they take place within an established fictional universe. Memento is very much grounded in reality. There are people who suffer from anterograde amnesia and the film portrays it very accurately. Ask yourself: If you could not make new memories, if you could only store certain pieces of information about your experiences but not all on some tangible object, how would YOU come to define yourself? What mistakes would you choose to learn from? How would you choose to feel guilty? This was just part of a string of existentialist films that came out during that two year time span from 1998 to 2000 but it's by far Christopher Nolan's magnum opus."
"patryk-czekaj","8","0","2","2 July 2012"," A fresh and intriguing idea in a confusing mind game
","Memento, based on a short story by Jonathan Nolan and directed by his brother Christopher, is an essentially unconventional crime thriller, which due to its own nonlinear narrative technique and purposely confusing storyline, makes it somehow hard to categorize as such or as any other specific genre.<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby (by any means don't call him Lenny), played persuasively by Guy Pearce, is a once successful insurance agent, who witnessed the rape and murder of his wife in his own home. What's more, the assassin has left him with an untreatable illness known as short-term memory loss. The last thing that Leonard is able to remember is the death of his wife, and thus, he is now on a deadly and vicious hunt for the man who took the love of his life and left him handicapped. On his journey he meets a few mysteriously suspicious people (especially Nathalie and Teddy), who sometimes want to take advantage of 'this thing that he has'. His brain isn't able to work in a proper manner, so in order to understand where he lives, who he meets, what he did, and what's the real purpose of his actions, he takes photos of people and locations and even tattoos important notes all over his body. When someone tries to discourage him by saying 'you aren't going to remember your revenge' he convincingly states: 'my wife deserves the revenge whether I remember it or not' and 'the world doesn't disappear when you close your eyes'.<br/><br/>In the movie the viewer encounters two interconnected stories, one told forward (in black and white) and the other backwards (in colors). The former goes on as we see Leonard talking on the phone with an unknown person, while he reminisces about a man named Sammy Jankis, who had to deal with a similar memory loss problem. The latter shows all the events that lead up to the first scene (shot overlooking a negative of a dead person and a killing prior to that), actually revealing all the missing elements. Even though with every consecutive sequence the story starts to take shape and becomes less and less complicated, it still is confusing. But that's good, because the viewer has to assume that this is the sole purpose of the movie, and re- watching it or reading various interpretations online won't support us with any new hints, only random divagations and probably more confusion on the way. That's why I think the movie leaves the best impression when seen only once.<br/><br/>Considering the fact that the narrative technique is straightly nonlinear, Leonard still operates on a daily basis in the regular timeline known to human mind. He isn't able to form any new memories, so the fact that the viewer observes all the events in a totally different order doesn't necessarily help the main character.<br/><br/>As we move on with the often perplexing storyline we stumble onto a maze, which sort of produces another maze, and, in the process, intentionally creates a puzzle within a puzzle (with the peculiar interest in riddles and perplexing plots it's easy to see why Nolan went on to direct Inception in 2010). <br/><br/>Memento is said to be one of the most scientifically accurate movies that deal with the problem of memory loss. In psychological evaluation, it not only realistically explains all the symptoms of this illness, but also presents one man's struggle to go on living his life no matter whether he will remember it or not. He just needs to have a certain goal that will make it all worthwhile. And the surprising ending, which I won't spoil here, gives him exactly wanted he wanted, and, in a deeper sense, all his actions seem to be justified in the thrilling finale."

","Memento, it's like two movies in one that meet in the middle for the story-altering climax.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce plays Leanord Shelby, an insurance claims investigator that suffers a rare form of amnesia that recalls the last 10 minutes of events on top of previously learned experiences after he and his wife are the victims of a burglary. Our story starts at the end of the story and moves back (forward?) to the beginning, along the way we meet a cast of eclectic characters including nominal police officer Teddy Gammell, a bartender called Natalie and a host of peripheral characters.<br/><br/>Since Leonard can't form deep memories, he uses tattoos to remember names and opinions on those he meets. Teddy isn't to be believed at all while Natalie helps him out of pity, for example. Inevitable, however, those around him take advantage of this situation by using him for their own ends. Natalie drives Leonard into a frenzy where he strikes her then waits outside for 20 minutes and reconstructs the incident into a situation to suit her own purposes, sending Leonard on a goose chase. Brilliant! Through the flashbacks we also see a couple afflicted with the same disease, where the husband cannot learn through practice but is denied a claim until his wife repeatedly asks him for a diabetes shot, which he repeats over and over and over until she passes away. We start seeing this couple as an extension of Leonard's own, especially when we see him giving her the same kind of shot! In the end, both halves of the movie collide and we witness the burglary, the assault on both of them and Teddy's role in the whole thing. Memento leaves your disoriented but yearning for the next piece of information that might give you the whole story, a story incomplete not through poor work by the writers, but rather because of one man's faulty recollections.<br/><br/>See it once at least just for the novelty and talking points."

The movie starts with the end, and works its way back 4 minutes at a time until you know exactly why everything happened. You see the effect, and then you see the cause. It's not as complicated as it sounds and it really flows together nice so even the lesser intelligent watchers can follow the plot. Guy Pearce does an amazing job and he has the perfect voice for a fast talking, intelligent man who has to get things done fast so he doesn't forget. It's Christopher Nolan's first masterpiece and it wont be his last. It's every bit as good as Inception or The Dark Knight if not better. Every film buff should see this.

","Memento is a wonderingly complex, intelligence and bold thriller from Christopher Nolan, offering us a rich tapestry of story and ideas. It was the film that put Nolan on the map and was one very compelling thriller.<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man suffering anterograde amnesia, which results in having no short term memory. He has to take Polaroid photos and making a lot of notes to get by as he solves the mystery of who raped and murdered his wife. He has two allies, a bartender Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is in trouble with a local drug dealer and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). But one or both of them could be using Leonard for their own reasons. Leonard also thinks back to his past life as an insurance investigator and to a man with the same condition Samuel R. Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky).<br/><br/>Nolan employs an non-linear narrative, telling the story backwards, unfolding the mystery the other way and see how Leonard came to that conclusion. We know as much as Leonard as we dissect the web of clues and we do not know who we really should trust. These are characters in there own self interests and the whole film is a puzzle.<br/><br/>There are three great leads performance, playing interesting characters that motivations swing back and forth as they play on Leonard's condition. They are well written, complex characters that were believably played by the actors and makes them compelling. Pearce has to be on the top of his game for a very challenging role. He pulls it off exceptionally well and it is a shame he was never the big leading actor he deserves to be.<br/><br/>There are some nice little touches through out the film, from a scene where one of the characters takes all the pens to prevent Leonard making a note and the different filming styles to show the duel narratives.<br/><br/>Memento is an intelligence, well thought out film that deserves the reputation it has earned.

","It was my second time ever;viewing Christopher Nolan's thriller ""Memento"".Memento is about Leonard Gray, a San Fransisco resident that is left with brain damage after receiving a hard blow to the head from a frightened home invader.His brain damage gives him a disorder called short term memory loss and changes his life forever.Memento recounts the chilling events that follow Leonard's misfortune.<br/><br/>Leonard is a former insurance adjuster with a diabetic wife;who commits suicide by repeatedly requesting her insulin dose from a brain damaged Leonard.She dies in a coma, and because Leonard is unable to retain facts unless they're retold to him several times(this method is also known as rote learning),his ""recall"" is terrible.He's left with a false memory of his wife's death in which he teaches himself by sharing it with pol ice multiple times.After Lenny's brain damage is discovered,one police officer,John G, decides to take advantage of Leonard by moving him out of his home and into a cheap motel room to use him as his personal hit-man.John G easily convinces Leonard that his name is Teddy and he is helping him track down his wife's murderers(what Leon ard believes to be the home invaders that injured him).After catching the actual home invader(who didn't really murder anyone),Leonard seems to forget this event entirely and is afterward tricked into murdering a drug dealer that a female friend of his,Natalie is wary of,along with 2 or 3 more enemies of John G's.Leonard tattoos impor tant markers onto his body and takes polaroids but still constantly forgets everything anyone says or does to him.<br/><br/>The details of the movie signify Lenny's hippocampus' as the problem;as he is obviously unable to encode or con solidate anything that doesn't happen more than once.Parts other than his episodic memory like declaration or proce dural memory seem to be fine.He can clearly retain regular facts,like John G's(Teddy's) face,the location of favorite bars and resturaunts and his own belongings.Ultimately,this bloody tale ends when John G tells Leonard the truth,and in stead of taking quick notes of who his next victim will be,Leonard burns all evidence of the horrible killings and writes himself a note of instruction; to track down and kill John G; and ignore anything John says to him beforehand.<br/><br/>Leonard lets everything that's occurred ""go"" and moves on with his new life.What he will or won't remember about any of his past without help is unclear at the end of the film. I believe ""Memento"" portrays short term memory loss very accurately..the screenplay makes it very obvious what the physical and psychological details of Leonard's disorder are.I don't feel it was necessary to edit the story without chronological order.The story is complex and exciting with an intense climax and it's a movie that one would have to pay close attention to even if it was in order from start to finish.It was too much in my opinion,to backtrack any parts of the film that didn't involve story telling(like Lenny's episodic recall of Sammy Jenkins).All of the backtracking caused my viewing experience to be more interactive than I cared for.Because of that,I believe I would've enjoyed<br/><br/>Memento more if it had been edited differently.<br/><br/>Memory is extremely important and regular mental tasks like learning or listening are more delicate and valuable than we all appreciate.For instance,if one were to try to pass up their own mind's encoding system and take notes of everything they saw or heard in one day.they wouldn't do much else!The movie makes that fact even more apparent and illustrates the possible detriment to our lives the inability to perform a simple but priceless mental function ,like encoding and consolidating facts could be.Memento is such a great story that the fabulous acting is almost unnoticeable.That was my second viewing of the film an there will probably be a third."

","Even back in his early movies like Memento, the great Christopher Nolan proves what an intelligent filmmaker he is. It would usually take years of experience for most directors to create a film like this. I compare this film to another one of his that came out ten years later and that is Inception. They both have the same goal: to get the audience to think. Memento will surely get one to think. That is why this is a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>This film has a very complex plot. It's about a guy who has no short-term memory so he writes notes all over his body. Quite simply, that guy is looking for the person who killed his wife and took away his memory.<br/><br/>The acting is really good. Guy Pearce is such an underrated actor. He should get more credit with the Academy. Also, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano gave great performances.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best mystery films out there. This movie also has a rarity. It's filmed backwards which I very rarely see in the movies. This movie also jumpstarted Christoper Nolan's career. I only rate this movie an 8/10 because it gave me such a headache watching this film from thinking too much."

","Memento has become one of the most well known popular films of its genre, and its not hard to see why. Calling it a convoluted and labyrinthine thriller would be an understatement. This film is sleek, and you can even see that by the way Leonard dresses in a beige cool suit with a fancy sports car, but with the twist of him living in a dingy motel. Set around a dark story about a man with short term memory loss, hunting around trying to find the man who murdered and raped his wife, it contrasts with small quirky jokes. The narrative throws people off track by its order, of going backwards and forwards at the same time, then meeting at the beginning of the story, at the end of the film. This film does not need a complex mind to understand but it can help. You are in the brain of Leonard and getting told the story from him, but how are you meant to get the right story, if the narrators brain is unreliable? Christopher Nolans ""memento"" is a unique masterpiece which will keep you on the edge and puzzling what to believe."

","No but seriously this movie is great. It's not for those who like lots of action and no story. There is not much action in this movie it's mostly psychological. It makes you use your brain. The movie run backward (start with the end and then you see scene after scene until you reach the beginning of the movie). It makes you feel like the main character because you don't know what the f**k is happening to him and you don't understand anything. The way it's written you really feel like you have memory issue and you can't remember anything past few minutes. This movie is a master pieces ans a must watch as long as you like good psychological movie. If you are a fans of action movie you will not enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan is an amazing Director and he shows it with this movie again (or maybe should I say it started is Carrier because it's one of his first movie). Every single movie he made are great so if you are a fans of Nolan's work (Inception, Batman Begins, Batman the Dark knight, The prestige) well you definitely want to have a look at this one.<br/><br/>9/10"
"amillerz3","10","0","2","2 May 2012"," Memento: Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece
","What can I say. From one of the most intelligent directors of our time comes one of the most thought-provoking and ambiguous films of all time. A man who has lost the ability to create short-term memories seeks the person who raped and murdered his wife. Armed only with the tattoos on his body (as a way of reminding him who he is and details about the murderer) and a pistol, he stakes out a town with the help of his friend Teddy, searching for the mysterious John or James G. While the plot may sound a bit traditional, the presentation is anything but. The story is essentially told in reverse, in order to imitate the feeling of short-term memory loss. While there are little snippets here and there that are told in forward motion, that is only for the sake of continuity when the character reveals his background. Everything else is told in reverse. For most of the movie, you are lost, like this man, caught in a perpetual state of disbelief and confusion. However, as the forward clips and the reverse clips intersect, the story comes together completely. For a movie that ends with what is technically the middle, it has an unbelievable twist. The dialogue is thought-provoking and clever, the direction is flawless, and Guy Pearce gives, in my opinion, his best performance ever. Go and see Memento"
"ralph-wade","9","0","2","1 April 2012"," Like no other
","Memento is like no other movie i have ever seen or am likely to ever see. This a film that that is fairly easy to describe the outline of the plot but almost impossible to describe the story. Guy Pierce plays an insurance investigator who suffers from short term memory loss after a bash on the head during the murder of his wife. this means that he can't retain any memories for more than 5 minutes although he can remember everything before the accident. With this affliction he tries to find the killer of his wife to inflict revenge. The way the film plays out is quite brilliant. It has little pattern yet it is so watchable simply because all the time you are trying to work out what it going. It is like the viewer has the same term memory loss as the main character.While it is almost impossible to know where you are in the story it is not irritating in the way some films can be when the story is to complicated. Guy Pierce is superb and pulls this off to perfection.But i think a big congratulation goes to Christopher and Jonathon Nolan for the brilliant direction and writing. 9 out of 10."

","Memento is about a man who can no longer build memories. Thus he has to write things down on post-its and photographs to remember them, and tattoo things on his body to make sure he doesn't forget them later. Memento is masterfully edited and directed, with a complex plot and unique, intricate time line that puts the viewer in a unique state of mind. Due to the way Memento is directed and put together, you end up not knowing who to trust, what anyone's motives are, or even what happened when and in what order events took place. In short, the movie puts you in the character's state of mind - a man who has short-term memory loss, and all he knows is either tattooed on his body or written on some photos. Memento is disorienting, its confusing, and its a unique experience. Nolan really succeeds in putting the viewer in the character's frame of mind, and in keeping us hooked until the very end. Nothing is clear until the very last scene of the movie, and even then the motives and 'sides' of certain characters will not be clear, and it may take a while to fully understand what happened, in what order.<br/><br/>plot: 10/10 characters: 10/10 although they lack development, this goes in line with the movie's feel since the lack of development emphasizes that we are in Leonard's state of mind and point of view and only know what we see of other characters editing: 10/10"

","What a strange movie! I know that when describing this film the most obvious thing to mention is the unusual editing. But it's worthy of every mention, so forgive me as I repeat what everyone's said a thousand times. The reverse chronological order is quite a fascinating trick. Using editing to force the viewer into Leonard's situation was a brilliant trick that, though it mired me so much I had to sit there and ponder what I had seen for nearly fifteen minutes, is worthy of praise. Honestly, I can't think of a better way to use editing to create empathy than this. It's hard to imagine just how difficult it would be to have Leonard's condition...until you see it on the screen and realize just what that poor fool would have to deal with, solving a murder and not being able to remember anything about it. All-in-all I truly enjoyed this film, which just oozes film noir attitude with a fresh, new device to spice it up a little."
"meg-ryan","8","0","2","23 March 2012"," Disturbing but Powerful Movie
","Memento plays with our emotions using Leonard, as he often seems to be an emotional void with a very faint sense of hope that he will ""solve"" the murder of his wife. Eventually, the audience knows what has happened to her, and that people constantly try to tell him that her case has been solved, but Leonard knows nothing. He essentially sabotages his own mind in order to have that single, missing piece of the murder case continually hanging in the air, making for a very sad, desperate character for whom we feel great pity. The simplicity of the movie is also displayed here, in that the basic action of crossing out a few words means that Leonard must embark upon his desperate search again. He is deceitful to himself, and does not even know it - the audience is left with the mixed emotion of feeling sorry for Leonard, and being angry at him for double-crossing himself at every turn. We do not know what to think of him, meaning that such a character is a powerful tool. I remember that when I saw this in the cinema, certain parts amused the audience greatly, such as when Leonard found the empty bottle, without recalling why he was there in the bathroom, and thought, ""I don't feel drunk...."". I didn't find this funny at all, nor do I think Nolan was attempting to insert an element of comedy. I simply felt sorry for him, knowing that this is the continual path of his life. This reminds me somewhat of Shutter Island, just a hopeless ending to a good movie."

","Spoiler Alert in this review! This film is about a man named Leonard Shelby played by Guy Pearce. He suffers from short term memory after his wife was murdered. He is guided throughout the film by two other characters named Natalie and teddy played by Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano. They are working against each other and using Leonard against the other. This causes Leonard to have to rely even more so on his notes that he leaves for himself. The theme of this film is revenge. Guy Pearce character is searching for the killer of his wife and has no clue that he has already killed the man. Joe Pantoliano character is a dirty cop that uses Guys character to kill off criminals. Essential Joe's character Teddy uses Leonard's thirst for revenge to his advantage as a dirty cop. The actors in this film did a wonderful job in portraying the characters in a way that made them seem innocent at first before they were revealed to be bad characters. The film Columbiana featuring Zoe Zaladana has a story about revenge as well. She spends her entire life trying to murder the evil drug lords involved in the death of her loving parents that were shot in front of her when she was a child. Even though she doesn't suffer from short term memory loss, as Guys' character does, she is haunted by the memory of her parent's death just as Guy's character. No matter what occurs in her life and despite her family pleading with her to move on she pushes for revenge. IN the end she reaches her goal but is forced to be apart from the one person that she fell in love with to hide from being arrested for the murders. The techniques used in this film were very well put to use. The lighting of the film was set to give the effect of a dream. It created an illusion throughout the film making it harder for the viewer to see the truth. Several different angles were sued as well in this film. They used angles to give the illusion of a dream as well Angles from the perspective of Leonard's eyes in real time! This film is about the loving husband's revenge gone bad and one may either love or hate this film. I don't believe there is an in between. If you like thrilling movies with twist and suspension this is the film for you. Just remember revenge can be bitter sweet."

","I thought Memento was one of the better shot movies that I've seen in awhile. Its about a man named Leonard who uses notes, pictures, and the tattoo's on his body to try and find the man who he thinks raped and killed his wife. Not too often do you have movies that start from the end of the movie and finish at the beginning using multiple jump cuts, giving you more information each time but also going back farther from the beginning scene. Within the first five minutes a guys head gets blown off and you have no idea why. The reason why i thought this movie was so great was that throughout the movie you are trying to put all the pieces together just as Leonard is. You feel like your in his shoes throughout the entire movie which keeps the audience enticed. I thought it was great in the end finding out that he had actually already killed the man who killed his wife but it never stuck with him, so to make it stick he just changed the details to be remembered as if his friend Teddy Gammel did it because him and the killer have the same last name."

","Right after watching the Movie I wanted to give about 6 from 10 Points. It was much too confusing, not that thrilling (as you already knew who the ""real"" murder is) and you didn't get all the answers at the end. But somehow I made a review myself and thought about the whole plot. Actually, I had to admit: Its not I that got confused, Its Nolan that wanted me to get confused ! The whole thing is made up backwards to learn two things: First - imagine life as it could be, learn to love what you got - because somehow life can change and the only thing you rely on are pity emotions like revenge that provides your life with some sense. And second: Not everything really is, as it looks like on first view. You can adapt this interpretation for almost every situation of life - for example prejudices. And maybe you can also test yourself about how moral you are. Do YOU understand Leonards behavior if Teddy really tried to help him, by burning all the evidence for already killing the real murder but hunting instead Teddy as nothing in life worths than the sense for revenge? Or maybe do you even share this behavior? Or do YOU deny all of Leonards doing? Whatever it is, its all in your imagination.<br/><br/>Well: I have to admit, Nolan really got me. He caught me that much with his confuseness that I almost didn't get the message and messed up all the intentions. But as it made me think about life and esteem, what every good movie should get the viewer up to, I give it 9/10.<br/><br/>Very good Nolan!"

Part of the story is told backwards but the brilliance isn't just that goes backwards. Each scene tells you something new about the story that leads you to think one thing.

It is truly an experience———not just a film...

","Two hobbies that I enjoy above most others are going to the movies and puzzles. As long as the latter isn't more tricky and complicated than it really needs to be, and focuses on a point where an average person can ponder over it and figure it out without losing the enjoyment of solving a problem, I am always looking forward to a good brain-teaser. So, as you can imagine, I was very eagerly looking forward to ""Memento"" one of the early films of the much-lauded Christopher Nolan, whom I also have great admiration for. Now ""Memento"" could be considered more of an avant-garde narrative puzzle than a groundbreaking film and it probably works better on a first viewing than a second, but it had me enveloped from the word go.<br/><br/>Director Nolan and his brother, co-screenwriter Jon Nolan, took the conventional narrative movement and essentially played it in reverse. The movie's timeline starts at the end, with an amnesiac (Guy Pearce) murdering another man (Joe Pantoliano) and then photographing his handiwork. May not seem all that extraordinary or new, except that it's played in reverse, so the Polaroid we see in extreme close-up goes from developed to black and the blood on the walls runs upwards instead of down. From there, the picture plays its narrative backwards in section, with black-and-white prologues and epilogues, if you will, providing the groundwork for what will come in between.<br/><br/>The story is that Mr. Pearce is an amnesiac for anything that happened in the past few minutes. Yet he's on a mission to murder the man who raped and killed his wife. Could it be the fellow from the beginning? How would a man with this condition maintain such a task without being conned, used, or targeting the wrong guy? Well, that is one of the great things about ""Memento."" The imaginative if non-plausible information that it supplies in suggesting how a person with this handicap could accomplish (or try to, at least) something of this nature. For instance, Mr. Pearce photographs his current residencies (motels, usually) and the people he's helping or help, and jots down notes. They're notes for the audience as well as him, and that's another thing that makes this so much fun: audience involvement. It's up to us to help solve the mystery as well.<br/><br/>Played in a regular narrative-form, ""Memento"" might have been a neo-noir. To some extent, it might still be, with its elements of a misguided, vulnerable man, a femme fatale (or is she?), and a mission to murder. But overall, it's more or less a film of its own kind. One of the best things about Christopher Nolan the director as well as the storyteller is that he's like Stanley Kubrick in this regard: he's self-defined. He makes his movies in a way that is distinctly his own and unlike others, probably part of the reason why he's admired by some and absolutely despised by others. He's got an aggressive style that is mostly foolproof (although I would prefer he learns to frame action in wider shots and ease up on the quick cuts) and very engaging. It's always fun to see something new, and so his radically unique style is perfectly matched to this radically unique form of storytelling.<br/><br/>The picture is like your favorite jigsaw puzzle, if that's your thing. It's most exciting the first time around and still plenty enjoyable once you've done it a few times and gotten a pretty good handle on which pieces go where and when. It is also very well-acted, with an especially good performance from Joe Pantoliano as the murdered man, who turns out to have played a big part in the amnesiac man's life before. As the amnesiac, Mr. Pearce does a phenomenal job acknowledging one fact and then seeming to forget it a minute later. A picture like this requires a star who can work well with the audience and he succeeds on all levels. Carrie-Anne Moss, as a woman who might not (or just might) be helping Mr. Pearce along is in good form as well, providing flesh and blood to a fascinating supporting character.<br/><br/>It's no wonder why Christopher Nolan has become one of the more widely-discussed filmmakers of the twenty-first century. Again, to compare him to Kubrick, he's self-defined and engaging in his own unique way. But it's more than unique that makes his films, ""Memento"" included such a treat. It's the way he engages the audience. Granted, his style is not for everyone. Folks who dislike puzzles and mind tricks, beware."

","I just watched this picture three times in five days, and before you get around to asking - no, I'm not a glutton for punishment. It's just that I was totally fascinated with the way the story was presented, as if it was rigged with a perpetual rewind button that brings the viewer back a couple days prior to the last rewind. These kinds of stories have a way of making my head hurt, but there was something about this one that was different. Maybe it's the way the story had you empathizing with Guy Pearce's character Lenny. The man was relentless in his quest to find his wife's murderer, but at the same time, that murder might not have ever really happened. There are literally as many interpretations of this picture as there are people who have seen it, and reading some of the other viewer posts and discussion threads are bound to move even the firmest of opinions to yet another different conclusion. So in that respect, the film invites criticism for being nothing more than a gimmick, even if a thought provoking and mind bending gimmick. I have to say, I usually like my movies wrapped up in forthright fashion, even if I don't like the resolution. But here it's virtually impossible to know anything for sure because it's all based on Lenny's reconstruction of events, relying on facts and not memories, as he explains in one of the sequences to Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). But what happens when the facts can metamorphose as they did here? I just know I can't watch this again for awhile because I've come to enough different conclusions already."

So here I am, the last day of summer after seeing it again, and now I can.<br/><br/>Memento is incredible. It has to be the most small-scale mystery-crime-thriller I've seen, with a total of 3 major characters, but it's quietly brilliant. If it was a normal film, told front to back, it would be above average, but only just. Luckily it's not.<br/><br/>The best part of Memento, the thing that makes it stand out, is it's format. When you first watch, it takes a while for anything to start making sense, and it actually hurt my head trying to figure out the timeframe. I won't say how it plays out, but it's outstandingly unique. And for some reason, like the protagonist Leonard, you can't remember what just happened. Even now, I totally forget the beginning- wait the end- no, the beginning of the film. I just can't remember.<br/><br/>A special note- the opening credits are the best part of the film. When you catch on to what's happening, you'll gasp. It's explosive and brilliant.<br/><br/>The three main characters are excellent. They are layered, well- played, and keep you guessing. Leonard is our protagonist, played by Guy Pearce in a big change from his other major role in L.A. Confidential. He cannot make new memories, which is why the film is presented so uniquely. He is generally disciplined, and conflicted about everything not tattooed to his body or in his photos. Guy Pearce is excellent as this walking uncertainty. His narrations are blank, like his general perception. It helps that he just looks the part. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are excellent as Natalie and Teddy, the support who aren't what they seem to appear to look like. Sound confusing? It is, until we find out more and more about them. Their personalities- or what they look like- are really good.<br/><br/>Another note- music is minimal, but great. It really captures the small scope, while being stirring.<br/><br/>The plot is good, but is much better because of the presentation and editing that keeps the scenes from looking choppy. There's a neat twist that changes our perspective, and Memento simply has to be seen again or you'll miss out on key things. Also, you'll totally forget your first viewing.<br/><br/>One last note- it's really cool when the film changes from black and white to colour. Leaonard literally shakes colour into the film.<br/><br/>In short you have to see this. It's original and unique, presented very well, and offers an intriguing tale from a cool perspective. I could easily see someone saying this is their favourite film ever. I could even be yours.<br/><br/>9.2/10"

I have heard people who have considered this movie boring because it's too strange and just a jumble of things to have in your mind.

","I just watched this movie now, in 2011. Why I waited so long? Some movies just give me a bad vibe and i can know upfront if i'm gonna like them or not. So far, the only movie I was wrong about was V for Vendetta. I didn't want to see it, but did and was completely amazed.<br/><br/>With Memento...not so much. The storyline is just way too complicated to be explained in such short time. I know, Memento is special because it's not meant to be obvious...blah blah. I'm not gonna bash the movie because everyone has their own opinion, tastes in art and so on. I'm gonna say Memento is in film industry what poetry is in literature. It can be seen in many different forms. I just happen not to like that in a movie. <br/><br/>For example, Shutter Island is, for me, a perfectly done movie in the somewhat same genre of mind-f like Memento. Suspense, thrill, mystery, unpredictability...has it all. And in the end it can be interpreted in different ways but you can back it up with something.In Memento, there are different ways to understand it but no logic at all. You can just guess what happened with no arguments, only guesses. And you can never be really sure what the hell went on there. It's like I write down some sentences(seemingly related) for a couple of pages and let you decide what I'm writing about.<br/><br/>The only reason why I watched it to the end was because i just wanted to know what the f happened. Only to be left alone in the dark in the end! :D Just kidding. In some ways, it's like The Elephant man. Simply f'in hard to watch. Just hard to watch.<br/><br/>I don't want to rate this movie at all, because I really wouldn't know what to rate it. It's not bad, it's not the best...It left me with no feelings at all. And when i feel nothing, I can't rate it. It gave me no new experience.<br/><br/>For The Dark Knight, I didn't want to get out of theater because I didn't want it to be over. I was thrilled. That's what I like about movies. A story with a message. Something that touches you as a human being. I love movies because I learn from them. Memento felt more like a test with no right answer, and I learned squat from it. Maybe I should watch it again and again...after a couple of times, maybe it'll make more sense. Nah, that's just too much hard work. :D"
"pacifist_parsi","9","0","1","6 August 2011"," I think that it is classical
","I think the film Memento fell under the Formalist editing style. To start off, the cuts from one shot to another were very sharp. They went right from one to another, no fade out. Also, the way they went from the present to old memories, was constantly changing. Since it changes from color to black&white, it created an opposite conflict of time. Lastly, the story created many different view points and stories. This came from the unreliable narrator, and also from the unreliable people who used him throughout it. It made you think throughout the film and was very thematic as well.<br/><br/>2. How well did the editing establish and maintain Rhythm?? I think Memento had a well-paced rhythm. Though it was confusing at times, it was the narrator that made it so. The rhythm itself was well done through out. The speed of which they had each shot was perfectly done, stopping right after you realized it was starting to repeat. Also, the speed wasn't too fast, and always kept you guessing. I really liked how Christopher Nolin chose the setting as well to correspond with the scene. It made it more believable and relevant to what was happening. ALI KOHAN FOROTAGHE_ifilm.freeblog.ir"

","Another one of those films I came to with very high hopes after lots of personal recommendations and high plaudits in reviews etc. etc. etc. but came away slightly disappointed. Perhaps years of reading 'twist in the tale' novels by people like Jeffrey Deaver has made me more immured from excitement of this type of thing, I don't know. I didn't guess the ending, but then like an episode of Taggart, it didn't reveal sufficient plot details along the way to enable you to do this. On the other hand the punchline didn't knock me off my feet either. The best I can say about the story is that it was better than The Usual Suspects (and I did guess the end in that). I was disappointed that the writer or director felt the need to include a scene where a drink exposes just how goldfish-like the hero's memory is. We'd already established that and the scene added nothing to the story other than a eewww moment, but other than that, every little rewind of the story and extra exposure of the plot fitted and worked well. Still, at the end of it all, I couldn't help feeling so what? Guy Pearce filled a character without any depth with real depth. Partially helped by a great physique and some intriguing tattoos, although we knew almost nothing of his character other than his plight, you were driven to watch as he made an otherwise unbelievable character perfectly believable. Ultimately though, just because we believe he could be real, that isn't the same as caring what might happen to him and for all it's clever twisting, take away the superb performance of Guy Pearce and we're left with a rather gimmicky plot rather than a classic film."

"lynnblake1108","9","0","1","20 June 2011"," Fabulous Film
","When ""Memento"" first started up, I was a little bit skeptical. To my surprise, I was immediately entranced by this clever film. Obviously, the plot structure is the most notable part of this work. While the majority of the audience found it confusing and nonsensical, I thought it was perfect. You didn't have to think until you were exhausted, but it did require the audience to pay attention all the way through. The ending was somewhat predictable. I figured out that Leonard was actually Sammy Jenkins when Teddy said (for the second time) ""That's who you were, but who are you now?"" It made me realize that his story corresponds perfectly to that of Sammy's. It just makes me question the validity of the movie as a whole. What really happened? How do we know? Is there any way to tell? Even if we watch the movie in ""order"", with all the color pieces in their chronological sequence, would the movie be different? Personally, I believe the movie wouldn't be nearly as captivating nor interesting.<br/><br/>Another key element in this film is the concept of time and its passing. Leonard has no concept of time, and thus, we as the audience have to forget all of our preconceived notions about time. If we don't, then it's easy to get lost in Leonard's condition. For example, when Natalie leaves the house for a moment or two to manipulate Leonard, we see her exit her car, then go back to enter it, and then exit again. If we as the viewer didn't understand that time has no meaning to someone with a memory problem, then we cannot figure out why society interacts with them in such peculiar ways.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was fantastic. I love Guy Pearce, and his acting choices fit in perfect correlation with how it was written. Natalie was quite an obnoxious, manipulative demon, but Stowe's acting was impeccable. Even the little characters, like Burt the rental guy, seemed to be extremely realistic, which always adds points to a film.<br/><br/>All in all, Memento was a fabulous film. I had no major qualms with it."
"boblangill","9","0","1","13 June 2011"," Memento immerses you in an experience that movies rarely provide.
","Leonard's mission to find the man who murdered his wife faces a big handicap. With his total loss of short term memory, he can't hang on to the clues he finds.<br/><br/>The movie shows us Leonard's story from end to beginning so it's easy to get caught up in the strange loops of the narrative. This technique is not just a gimmick. The inverted sequence drives the story in ways that make events flow in a way we can follow, but also hits us with sudden ambushes. Memento puts us inside the mind of a man whose mind can't work right. The experience is strange and disorienting, rare and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The best illustration of this occurs some way through the movie. We are abruptly cut to a junk yard, and we hear Leonard thinking to himself ""Am I chasing him? Or is he chasing me?"" And at this point, we don't know. Despite everything we've seen and heard, and figured out so far, we have NO idea. There is simply no way to make it fit in. And no time to sort it out. We are very much in Leonard's skin.<br/><br/>Even if told in a normal sequence, Memento has layers beyond the story line. Beyond the story line about Leonard's mission, we see how life delivers rough justice: What happens to Leonard is rough justice for what he did to someone who suffers from the same memory loss. The stranger we see Leonard murder at the beginning of the movie is receiving severe judgment for his crimes. Also, everyone who interacts with Leonard takes advantage as soon as they discover his shortcoming. A pretty dark take on human nature.<br/><br/>""in medias res"" starting the story in the middle is an effective way to tell a story. Memento may begin at the end, but it constantly keeps us in the middle of things. The rare experience it provides is good reason to see it. It's also the reason it's not a big commercial success. Watching Memento again, you can't re-experience what you experience seeing it the first time, and you may find the initial experience so disconcerting you don't recognize that that's the payoff. I'm glad I rented it. It gave me a rare, disturbing experience that I couldn't recapture."

Still OK as it is, but I prefer the intrigue and mystery. I agree with some folks, the constant cuts back & forth do get tiresome, but there is a reason for it all. Well done.

","Memento is an excellent movie. My favorite in fact. Leonard, the main character, loses his short term memory after attempting to save his wife when she is being raped and murdered in their bathroom by two men. One, Leonard shoots then and there, but the other, John G, gets away. Leonard spends the movie trying to find John G and kill him. This is extremely difficult as he has no short term memory which means he can't remember anything he's done between the incident in the bathroom and now. He even forgets things that happened 10 seconds ago sometimes. The alternating scenes between forward and backwards chronologically gives the viewer the same perspective as Leonard giving us surprises around every corner. Memento is a MUST see.

","Whenever we open our eyes, we see the world. We often acknowledge it through our conscious experience, and at times it fascinates us to the point of contemplating the experience. When we choose to close our eyes, then do we see nothing but absolute darkness. At times it can be even more confusing as we wonder if the world is still there when we close our eyes once more. Everything we perceive has some significance to it, and the lesson of Memento pertains to the knowledge of such a concept. Does it really matter whether or not we know, or is it simply the significance of that action that matters? Life at times can be overwhelming, and in order to continue we need a sense of purpose to keep going. At times we lose track of the truth behind our own motives.<br/><br/>Lenard Shelby (Pearce) is an antegrade amnesiac, meaning he can't retain any new memories. After witnessing the murder of his wife, and suffering brain damage at the hands of a masked attacker, Leonard has been searching for his wife's killer. There is never a mention of a time frame, merely a lone contemplation of timelessness as Leonard puts the pieces in what little order he can find. His reminder consist of tattooed facts and photographs containing scribbled notes. In his quest he often narrates his pain and longing for clearness, even so as much as breaking down his vulnerability to into a simple matter of knowledge.<br/><br/>From the reverse order, we are introduced to Teddy (Pantoliano) a sniveling detective like side-kick that aides Leonard, more or less to his own personal benefit, which is never hidden of course, and Natalie (Moss) a mysterious and equally questionable femme fatale. With both Teddy and Natalie harboring their own motives, the plot becomes more mysterious, despite our own knowledge of the conclusion. Teddy gives Leonard supposed leads, while Natalie bestows pity upon the wounded investigator, claiming more innocence and affection as she uses Leonard for her own purposes. Our curiosity remains strong though, as we follow Leonard in a backwards journey, where the truth can only be traced through memory, and the leap of faith he takes in searching for clarity.<br/><br/>It seems confusing at first, as the story begins at the very ending, spoiling the conclusion. However, the climax remains to be told as the story progresses and Leonard grows into the detective we first saw smeared in his victim's blood, retracting a gun as if it were a light saber, and gazing upon the justice he executed. It is a journey through time that although it plays in reverse, it introduces the characters brilliantly, as if it were in chronological order. At first, the impressions we'll have of them will be based on certainy, using the memories we acquired from the previous clip. However, as the story progresses, the tables turn and the notion of memory to which this film entails comes alive. Despite being mentally handicapped, Leonard disciplines himself through habit and routine, hoping that he never ends up like Sammy Jenkis.<br/><br/>Who is Sammy Jenkis? Well that name never goes unmentioned every time Leonard explains the fragility of his condition. Like Leonard, Sammy (Tobolowsky) suffered from short-term memory loss, falling rather than rising above the very nightmare that Leonard still faces. Dedication and mastery are but merely temporary shields for Leonard's mind. One moment of focus can easily disappear within an instant, leaving Leonard blank and with little to protect himself, and never knowing who or what to trust. In fact the uncertainty that plagues Leonard is further captured in the musical composition by David Julyan as his score further represents in his own words, ""yearning and loss."" It feels sad, but even more strange as this feeling of pain is never truly understood, thus representing the torment of Leonard's own uncertainty and torment.<br/><br/>Memento is Christopher Nolan's second feature film, just two years after the success of Following, and bordering on similar issues. Like Following, Memento explores the human mind within the context of memory and the dependency we place on it. With comparison to more factual matters, memory is never truly reliable, nor is it ever fully comprehendible. Through the film, much is left out, with Leonards' wife never being identified, or the time frame of the film remaining mysterious. It adds a timeless aspect of torment for the protagonist, yet with more to ponder at the conclusion of the film which leaves it at an ambiguous note of resolution. Leonard Shelby is indeed an interesting character, and through his determination his mind is explored through constant flashbacks, as well the sad voice-over narration he gives in understanding his journey, those he can trust, and the meaning of his actions. The film presents this question within the first ten minutes. Natalie tells him that he even if he succeeds, he won't be able to remember, This dark truth can only diminish hope for meaning in a world we all risk our lives to experience. The question of knowing whether there is meaning in our actions, although left open, leans more towards a more positive outlook, thus illuminating the skill of Chris Nolan as he delivers a film that is clever in its dialogue, entertaining in its story, and philosophically moving in the questions it poses. The only way something can have meaning is through our actions. What does it matter whether we know or not? ""The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?"

","Leonard Shelby wakes each morning to find that he can't remember anything past the date he and his wife were attacked in their home. During the attack, he received permanent brain damage and is unable to store short-term memory. Memento is a film depicting his journey to track down and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. You experience the movie just Leonard Shelby experiences life -- unable to draw on the past to determine how to perceive the present. Shelby is often confused and disoriented, but his drive to track down his wife's murderer gives him the ability to act on instinct and a few small notes and tattoos. The story itself is an incredible one, and you will certainly enjoy it. The telling of the story engages the brain in a unique way. As the film progresses, the viewer finds the information being presented explains scenes from earlier in the movie -- because the movie is presented basically in reverse. This style is similar to Pulp Fiction, but rather than a loose correlation of characters intimated in brief encounters, most people catch on to Memento's pattern rather quickly. This causes the viewer to desire sources of information that are the basis for Shelby's actions. The movie is an excellent story and presentation with a powerful climax, but some viewers may find the style of presentation tasking. I continually found myself waiting for information and paying less attention to the occurrences of the film. I truly sympathized with Leonard Shelby by the end of the movie, but since the presentation allowed viewers to know what the end result of each scene would be, I really had a feeling that I wanted the key element of the scene to appear. After that element appeared, I completely lost interest in the rest of the scene. Viewed linearly, the characters might be a little unrealistic. The musical score was extremely outdated -- it reminded me of something from a 60s or 70s film. The acting was excellent, with the exception of Guy Pearce -- incidentally the main character. I understand that it is very difficult to play a handicapped person, but I found his blonde hair and clean-cut look to be insufficient in compensating for his overly cool demeanor and emotionless performance. Watch this movie. It is a fair picture of a rare medical condition with a brilliant ending; however, I can only credit Jonathon Nolan with brilliance and Christopher Nolan with some pretty sub-par directing."

","Movie promoters nowadays go one of two ways, they either want to remind you of other popular (usually better) films or attempt to convince you to see their film by saying it is different to anything else that you've ever seen.<br/><br/>Option one often starts with ""by the guy who made Jingle All The Way"", or some similar crap, and ends with an even worse film.<br/><br/>Option two is even more criminally overused, The Mighty Ducks 3 all of a sudden is sold as a revolutionary change in filmmaking and anything with even one differentiating concept or idea is ""ferociously original"". Take Dead Snow for example, the movie is a cookie cutter shoulda been straight to DVD mediocre 80 minutes, but got a cinema release for one reason, ""Nazi zombies"".<br/><br/>Not much is fresh and truly new in Hollywood anymore...<br/><br/>Looking at the DVD cover for Memento I was surprised to see that none of those adjectives were used, as this is one movie made in the last decade where it is justifiable. The movie could have been made in a more traditional way, with some judicious flashbacks or the omission of select details until the end to preserve the twists.<br/><br/>The route Christopher Nolan took though makes Memento one of the better films of the millennium so far, not that there has been a huge amount of competition to this point. Guy Pearce is Leonard, the central figure in the film and the focal point of every scene.<br/><br/>It's a pretty big ask to expect one guy to carry almost 2 hours of cinema but Pearce - terrible hair and all - manages to carry it off. Pearce also handles the narration, but rather than just tell you what's going on he mumbles to himself almost under his breath, and pauses and backtracks at time like he's developing a script to be formally presented at a later stage.<br/><br/>Leonard experiences a real version of Groundhog Day, waking up each morning with no recollection of any events since a particularly stressful event that of the murder of his wife. There were many ways that this could have been played, but Christopher Nolan threw every ""standard"" method aside and sets the film out back to front, so the very first scene that we witness is the ""final"" scene in the film, and every scene prior is a reverse explanation of the plot.<br/><br/>So as mentioned in the opening minutes Leonard kills an acquaintance named Teddy for his wife's murder, with again the remainder of the film explaining the preceding events back to the very origin of Leonard's decision.<br/><br/>Confused? At times you will be, but if you pay attention you'll soon twig and learn how to follow events, and it all makes perfect sense eventually.<br/><br/>So while these events are being told in reverse, a few minutes at a time, with the start of each scene being blended into the final seconds of the previous one, there is a another plot line moving forward (kooky huh?) which loosely explains a similar situation to Leonard's. In a former life Leonard was an insurance investigator, the guy who investigates large claims to ensure that they are not false or fabricated, his very first case involved a claimant named Sammy, whose condition was remarkably similar to that of Leonard's.<br/><br/>So while Leonard's storyline unfolds in reverse, it is intercut with a relatively simple, yet parallel story which helps explain what Leonard goes through each day. Leonard retains his sanity through repetition and routine, he is unable to make new memories so periodically his mind resets to the previous default, and his recent experiences and conversations vanish permanently. Handy if you're a disgraced politician standing before the jury, annoying if you're a guy trying vainly to solve the murder of your wife.<br/><br/>To remedy this situation Leonard writes down important information and takes photos of prominent people and places in his life on polaroid, where he also jots down their name and significance to Leonard. For reeeealllly important information Leonard gets phrases and key points actually tattooed on his body. The amusing thing is that each morning, after he wakes up and looks for signs as to where he is, Leonard rediscovers the tattoos and repieces together the events and goals of his life.<br/><br/>Every day.<br/><br/>So we know that Leonard kills Teddy in the end at the start, but why we don't find out until the very end at the start. Got me? But rest assured this isn't a flick that rests upon one clever gimmick. It is understated, intelligent and favours a solid story over glitz. The acting is strong and though you have to follow the story a little more carefully than say Hannah Montana, it is far more rewarding when you eventually piece together the fragments and realise exactly what lead to Teddy's demise.<br/><br/>I recently had a late night semi-drunken convo (I was drunk, the other guy wasn't), where the topic of movies came up. We went through various classics and my mate wondered aloud why I felt the need to buy DVDs rather than just rent them or catch them when they are on TV. <br/><br/>I thought about it for a minute, and eventually explained that films like Memento though simply require the type of acknowledgment that I feel can only be given by shilling out to pay for the product.<br/><br/>This is worth your money - buy it.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. One of the better films of this decade to this stage, made all the more enjoyable with the deft direction.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"
"rorinh","7","0","2","3 November 2010"," A thought-provoking film with interesting aspects.
","Memento Critique I watched this film in my ""Writing about literature"" class in two segments on two different days. As Memento is such a choppy backwards/forwards sort of film, it was incredibly difficult to follow. The film made it easy for me to get lost and confused, especially watching it in two separate sections. I think to understand it fully you need to watch it two or even three times. The film was deep. It showed an intense vision into the human psyche. It was suspenseful in that, you are waiting for the end (or in this case, the beginning) to fully realize what is happening. There are quite a few readers on IMDb who think the backwards theme for films such as these are cliché however, I think it fit well. Watching it in succession, of course you would know the end from the beginning and though understandable, it wouldn't be as thrilling. Having the film move in this order made it stimulating. I liked it very much, but also personally, tend to like movies which move backwards to bring the mystery to the beginning.<br/><br/>There were several things I found which were interesting within the film. Everyone seems to take advantage of Leonard and his short-term memory. Particularly, Natalie with, ""I can talk about whoever the f*** I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a f***ing whore and we can still be friends!""  ""I'm gonna use you, you stupid f***. I'm telling you now because I'll enjoy it more if I know that you could stop me if you weren't a freak."" She then proceeds in a few minutes to exit and re-enter knowing Leonard won't know what she said. Another instance where she messes with him is when he gets to her bar where she bar-tends at. She spits in his cup and he watches her do so. But with his condition, Leonard doesn't remember and with a slam of the cup he's nothing the wiser. He drinks the beer and she decides he isn't lying about his condition. Leonard is taken for the fool again with his landlord Burt. He lies to him about how he rented a second room and must pay for that room as well as the first. Leonard realizes it didn't happen and Burt fesses up but still had the attempt at getting his hands on more of his money. Teddy attempts at lying just a bit with the line, ""You know, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes."" With a condition like Leonard's lack of short term memory, it is simple for even his so-called 'friends' to trick him.<br/><br/>Another thing I found quite interesting was how everyone seems to know when he 'forgets' what he has been told. For example, when Natalie has the fight with Leonard and he punches her, she takes all the pens so he can't write down what she said about his wife, and she walks out to the car. She waits for several minutes and comes back inside, slamming the door behind her. That slam seemed to jog his forgetfulness into existence and he immediately no longer remembers what he was trying to not forget. Also with the mug she smashed down on the bar table, it seemed to snap him out of his previous state and after that, he has a clean slate. Also when he is driving from the 'first' killing – he screeches his breaks and forgets what he just wrote about Teddy. It appears as though a bang or crash makes him forget and that no particular amount of time is what it takes.<br/><br/>And additional interesting aspect to the film was the things he did to keep 'sane' or remember his events. He tattooed himself with certain facts he MUST remember ""JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE"" and ""FACT 6. CAR LICENSE NUMBER: SG13 7IU"". He takes photographs of each person he meets who he gets to know personally and puts them in his pocket. He creates a map of where he has been and where he needs to go with more photos of places. He also makes up his own reality when he writes on the photos – sometimes lying to himself on purpose. I find it difficult after watching not to speculate on what will happen next. After Teddy is killed, and once you know he isn't the real murderer what happens? What can we speculate about Leonard? Can we perhaps wonder whether he will continue his search and continue to choose to forget what has happened? And how will he understand if he wakes up in the morning, forgotten what he has done, and still has tattoos of Teddy's license plate on his leg? This criminally implicates him, obviously. We read the story the film was based on as well in class and found he previously escaped from a mental institution. Will he only escape again: to commit more murder? Teddy was really the only person who knew who he was and now he has no one helping him decipher the clues and where to go now. Will he always be searching? Memento, whether you loved it or hated it, was nothing short of a very thought-provoking film. And you couldn't guess what happened at the end of the film (beginning of the story) which is how a good suspense film should be. Though confused, I was a huge fan and I think everyone should at least give this film a chance."

","If you're looking for a thriller and a mind twist then this is the kind of movie for you. This movie is about a man named Leonard who suffers from a ""condition"" which he reveals several times to people through out the movie. He is on the hunt for John G but does he ever really find him, or had he? He can't remember. People who do things out of revenge are seeking that feeling of satisfaction and to remember the way they felt. But what if you couldn't remember feeling that but you always knew you were seeking it. Leonard knows how this feels after the last thing he remembers was his wife being raped and murdered, but on that same night he suffers a head injury that leaves him unable to make new memories. I'll leave you to watch the movie and place together these pieces. What makes this film so different from all the others is how we as the viewers are so carefully placed in the main characters shoes, we can feel what Leonard is feeling and barely know anymore than he does at the moment he is trying to figure everything out. We struggle with him and are usually just as confused as he is. The movie is played backwards, we start at the end and work our way to the beginning, with a few flashbacks and foreshadowing of which are sometimes hard to recognize but very useful as the movie progresses. This movie will have you in suspense during the whole thing, after it and even while you talk about it with others. Its definitely one to see a second time maybe even a third to see how carefully everything is placed together. Even after you see it once you'll be able to pick up on even more clues that are involved. This is one to talk about with your friends and share ideas that each on has picked up."

","Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man who, after witnessing the rape and murder of his wife, seeks revenge on the killer. However, the night his wife was murdered he sustained an injury to the head. This injury caused anterograde amnesia, more commonly known as short term memory loss. He remembers who he is, in fact he remembers everything up to the night when he became handicapped. The problem is that he cannot create NEW memories - after only about ten minutes his memory fades. This means that if he is in a conversation for too long he forgets how it started, if he is given directions to a destination he will forget them very soon, and everybody he meets he forgets. Leonard takes Polaroid photographs of places and people he comes into contact with and writes information about them on the Polaroid, and the really important facts he tattoos onto his body.<br/><br/>The real genius of this movie is the storytelling technique. It is told in a non-linear storyline. It shows the last chapter in the story first, then it goes back and shows the previous chapter. You are notified of the change by short black-and-white scenes in which Leonard is talking on the phone to an anonymous person. This backwards technique fits perfectly with Leonard's condition - he doesn't know what happened in the last chapter and neither do you. When Leonard looks at a Polaroid or at one of the tattoos on his body you are also shown, meaning that at no point do you know more or less than Leonard about what happened earlier. This film starts with the revenge killing, and works backwards to show us the preceding events.<br/><br/>Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix) plays a woman who appears to be a friend to Leonard, but Leonard's only source on her character are the notes that he doesn't remember taking. Joe Pantoliano is excellent as Teddy, a police officer who could be untrustworthy.<br/><br/>All of the acting is fantastic, and i'm sure 90% of the people who have seen this film are equally amazed as to how Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Inception) wasn't awarded the Oscar for best director or best original screenplay. This was Nolan's second full length film, and in my view, his best. <br/><br/>In conclusion - hunt out this film the way Leonard hunts out his wife's killer, and watch it. It is slightly confusing, and you may have questions at the end, but it is worth it. Personally i have not been able to get this fantastic piece of cinema out of my head for weeks. This movie is simply brilliant."

","Leornard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is determined to avenge his wife's rape and murder; however, since the the rape Leornard has had short term memory loss, making the investigation of who killed his wife very difficult. So, in order for him to find the killer, he has to constantly take pictures of people and leave a note about the person. As the movie progresses, you are taken back in time and being revealed more and more about the truth of Leornard's wife's murder, all while flashing back and forth from a phone call Leornard is having with an unknown stranger about a man who shares the same condition as him.<br/><br/>I believe that it is fair to say that Christopher Nolan truly is a movie making genius, and is one of the best Directors today. He has made five films that I have seen: Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Inception, The Prestige, and Memento. If you have not seen one of these films I suggest you go to a movie rental store and rent one. I constantly hear people arguing about what Christopher Nolan's masterpiece is, but personally I think we should more focus on his career, because he has yet to make a bad film. Or really he has not made a film that is not critically acclaimed. So far he has had an absolutely brilliant career, as both a writer, and director.<br/><br/>Now, to focus on the film. Memento has one of the most unique approaches I have ever seen. It is not everyday that you watch a movie that starts at the end, and then goes backwards from there. And I definitely did not think that starting at the end of a movie, I would be surprised. But like The Prestige, I was somewhat confused at times in the film, especially about how it was going to end, and yet again Christopher Nolan blows my mind with an unbelievably creative ending. His direction was very possibly worthy of an Oscar nomination, and if not that at least some recognition.<br/><br/>I think it is fair to say that Guy Pearce is not one of the better actors of our time. Espececially since the most recent movie I have seen him in was 'Bedtime Stories'. With that said I thought that he did a superb job with this role. The acting by everyone one else was not necessarily anything special, but it was done well enough for the movie to still be far above excellent. The film's script was also very good, like all of Nolan's films.<br/><br/>Overall, Memento is another one of Christopher Nolan's surprise ending thrillers. While I did not think the ending was quite as strong as the ending for The Prestige, it still blew my mind, and I certainly did not guess it, which is really all I can ask for. As this film came to a close I really could say that I was ""surprised"" by the ending, or actually more so by the beginning."

Throughout time will change. A situation will be happening that you don't totally understand. We get to see different sides of characters unfold that we didn't see because the person we see this movie through forgot. This makes it a mystery to be solved at the beginning.

","Memento tells the story of Leonard who has no short-term memory. He lost it defending his wife from a rapist. He compensates for this by writing down notes all the time about what has just occurred so that he might know who he is talking to and what he needs to do. He has a few facts about the man who raped/killed his wife and is on a quest to find him and kill him.<br/><br/>Since Leonard's confusion is the film's main premise, the story is told non-linearly so that we might also feel his confusion. A simple way to put it is that the film is shown in reverse order. This keeps the viewer constantly guessing what is happening and what are people's true intentions. It is very effective.<br/><br/>While the movie is quite good, there are a few flaws. The first, and lesser flaw, is that not all the vignettes are as interesting as the others. The beginning is fascinating, and the last hour as well. There is a good half-hour stretch in between these two points where the film drags a bit. The second flaw is that Leonard's condition does not stay consistent. Sometimes he can remember a seemingly twenty minute conversation, while at other times, he forgets what he was doing after only a minute. There are a few rules to his memory loss (like when a door shuts loudly it seems that this triggers memory loss), but on the whole, it seems like he only forgets when the plot needs him to.<br/><br/>Despite all these flaws, the movie is quite enjoyable. It is confusing, but in a good way. I could easily see myself watch this again in the near future. If you like Christopher Nolan, or if you just like a well-made film, I recommend Memento whole-heartedly.<br/><br/>4/5 stars (The movie is rated R for language and very brief drug use. There is some violence, but it's pretty PG-13)"

","Crackerjack thriller from fanboy phenom Christopher Nolan before he had directed ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"" and anyone knew who he was.<br/><br/>The film's gimmick is of course what gives it its cult appeal. Guy Pearce plays a man with short-term memory loss who's trying to reconstruct the crime that resulted in the death of his wife. He has to write down anything he wants to remember within moments of its happening; he even resorts to tattoing important information on to his body so he will be able to recall it later. We only learn pieces of the story as he learns them, beginning at the end and working our way backwards. It's a gimmick that's pulled off tremendously well by the direction and writing, but no one should praise the film's concept at the sake of its immensely talented cast, led by an award-worthy Guy Pearce. He's given terrific support by Carrie-Ann Moss (of ""The Matrix"") in a femme fatale role and Joe Pantoliano, playing the film's bad guy.<br/><br/>I saw this film in Denmark.

","Having recently seen and really loved Inception, I decided to see what other Christopher Nolan films lurked in my DVD collection. I couldn't believe it when I found I had never seen Memento. Well, a day work off due to an injury gave me the time to rectify this situation.<br/><br/>Leonard suffers from short-term memory loss. He can remember meeting you, but only for a few minutes, and then it fades away. He got this condition when he was hit in the head whilst trying to save his wife from the man who raped and murdered her. So, he can remember everything up to that point, but no further. In order to help him he takes photographs of people he meets and places he goes. He annotates these so he can refer back to them. There are also tattoos on his body of things he has decided are too important to lose. He is determined to find the man that murdered his wife and kill him. To this end he is helped by a character called Teddy, who seems to be a bit of a low-life. Along the way he also runs into Natalie, who has also lost someone and is more than she might first seem. Before the murder Leonard was an insurance investigator and he uses his skills to try and track down the mysterious John G, a name he has tattooed on his chest.<br/><br/>The story is told backwards; we start with Leonard killing the man he thinks is responsible for everything, and work back from there. It's a very interesting and effective way to tell this story, but you can't really take a bathroom break because you'll lose where the story is. I found the DVD pause facility very useful! Great performances from Guy Pearce as Leonard, also, Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy Gammell. Honourable mentions go to Jorja Fox as Leonard's wife, Stephen Tobolowsky as Sammy Jankis and Harriet Sansom Harris as Mrs. Jankis.<br/><br/>Although there are some nice action sequences in the film I found it to be quite slowly paced. It gradually draws the audience into Leonard's world as we find out more about how events transpired. The score is quite subdued and fits the mood of the piece perfectly. Over all, a very interesting and absorbing film, I liked it a lot! Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 9.1/10"
"random_avenger","8","0","2","22 July 2010"," Memento
","Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man with a tragic past. After a home invasion incident left his wife raped and murdered, he has lived for nothing but revenge. The tricky thing is, the same incident has rendered him incapable of remembering any recent event for longer than a few minutes, so he has to write everything down on paper, photographs or his own skin and always keep these notes with him. Despite his unusual amnesia, he is intent on finding and killing the man responsible for everything. Helping him are his talkative friend Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and a mistreated woman Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss).<br/><br/>The special thing about the way Memento is presented is that it's all backwards: starting from the conclusion and advancing to the situations that originally started Leonard's mission. Interspersed with the backwards narrative are chronologically progressing black & white flashbacks of Leonard explaining his situation to someone on the telephone. Like Leonard, the audience keeps learning new things from his past as time goes by, which is why the broken timeline is not just a gimmick but has a purpose in casting light on the nature of Leonard's condition.<br/><br/>Even though it could be very easy to lose track on the order in which the scenes are supposed to advance, Nolan's direction keeps the story perfectly understandable for an attentive viewer. Whilst it's true that the characters and the plot would be much less interesting had the story been narrated in normal chronological order, the movie is an enjoyable and unpredictable thriller as it is now. Examining themes like overcoming grief, finding a mission in life and the ultimate meaninglessness of revenge, Memento is a film that can be safely recommended to any thriller fan."

"theagea","10","0","2","2 June 2010"," narrative form in the fantastic movie 'memento'
","In 'Memento' Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) suffers from memory loss since the murder on his wife. He cannot make any new memories after this event, where he was also injured. Throughout the movie he tries to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, but because of his memory loss he has to make notes, Polaroids and tattoos of all the information he gains. The syuzhet of the movie is quite incomprehensible, because there are two story lines on the same story. One storyline is chronological and shown in black and white; the other storyline is narrated from the back to the beginning.<br/><br/>Firstly, Christopher Nolan succeeds very well in narrating the story in a convincing manner and he has tried to make the viewer experience everything like Leonard does. The viewer does not know anything more than Leonard: we only see what he does and the information he gets but we do not know the actual truth about the murderer of his wife where Leonard is looking for. Leonard's life is very unsecure: he has to do things and trust people without knowing whether it's the right thing to do. His life depends on the notes he makes, although these might be unreliable. Another way in which Nolan has made the movie very convincing is by using the perspective of Leonard: you can hear his thoughts and he is present throughout the whole movie: Leonard's actions are followed the entire time. By hearing his thoughts you can imagine how confused Leonard is after every time he loses his memory. Nolan did a great job in not being afraid to repeat certain parts. Usually this can become very annoying, while in this particular movie the repetitions make the movie more convincing and easier to understand how Leonard must have felt. Every morning Leonard has to remember himself that he has memory loss and what his goal is: he reads his notes, asks himself questions and looks at his tattoos.<br/><br/>The movie Memento starts with the murder on a man, but you don't know who this man is and what is happening. This immediately gives the confusing effect that Nolan intends to create, because it makes you wonder about how and why this happened. This will become clearer later on in the story, because the fabula is told backwards. In every scene you will get more information about the life of Leonard and on the murder of his wife. This makes the viewer very curious, because you really want to know more. One of the advantages of the movie is that the concept of memory loss and the narrative form (which is telling the story in reverse order) works really well as a combination. Due to the reverse order you are not wondering about what will happen next, but what has happened before, which is exactly how Leonard always thinks. In this way, you can really empathize with him and look at the story through his eyes. This was one of the reasons why we really liked this movie since the plot really involves you in the story and it does not get boring. Also, the movie has an open end so you can think up your own ideas of what actually happened since you cannot be sure who is telling the truth. However, if you want to understand (almost) the entire story you should watch Memento several times since one time will not be enough to do so.<br/><br/>Another thing that has been very well done in this particular movie is the fact that although the concept of a guy with memory loss whose wife is murdered is in fact rather serious and dramatic, there are some humorous parts in the movie as well. Leonard wakes up in awkward situations without knowing what he was doing, for example in the scene where he is being chased but thinks that he is chasing someone himself. In these scenes you hear Leonard's confused thoughts, which makes the movie a little less serious. So Christopher Nolan has tried to make the movie a little bit more lighthearted and not too heavy, which has worked out quite well.<br/><br/>And finally, not only the director did a great job while directing this movie, but he also chose the right cast. The actors definitely showed that they are very talented. Guy Pearce showed some great acting skills while representing the role of Leonard, because he has to act like he forgets everything and does this in a very convincing way. Lots of people recommend this movie and say that it is one of Guy Pearce's best movies, and we definitely agree with that since he really did a great job and it is a fascinating movie.<br/><br/>Memento is a very impressive movie and you will remember it because it is a very original way of telling a story. Furthermore, it reminds you of how precious memories actually are and how hard it is to not know which people you can trust. Memento is not a movie where you can relax while watching and which you will forget after wards. You even want to watch it again, and every time you watch it you will discover more and more In short, what we want to say is that we really recommend this movie and we can assure anyone who is interested in watching it that he/she will like it!"

Creators of Ghajini added some additional scenes so they can say that their movie is not a copy, those scenes include typical boring Bollywood love scenes and some totally unnecessary comedy scenes. I used the word 'copy' rather than 'remake' because the creators of Ghajini never admit that their movie is a remake of Memento, they always said that their movie is a remake of another Indian movie which is also a copy of Memento but this would be an act of stupidity to believe that they are not lying and they don't know about the existence of Memento, they just quietly copied Memento.<br/><br/>Now about the original movie. Its just great, despite the fact I already knew many things about this movie because I saw the Bollywood copy before I saw Memento I still loved this movie.

No of course it isn't and as if him having a bad memory and constantly repeating himself is difficult enough, the story is told backwards while another story of the same person plays chronologically forward until the two finally meet.<br/><br/>And to add to the pressure of your head possibly exploding with confusion and high expectations (it is 27th on IMDb), fear not. The Dark Knight Director Christopher Nolan is at helm, along with Guy Pearce and support from Carrie-Anne Moss - try to forget the fact she was in two of the most disappointing sequels ever.<br/><br/>All of them make this fall nothing short of sheer genius, despite not having any knockout performances. However that doesn't mean Guy Pearce isn't convincing as the poor chappy suffering anterograde amnesia (thank you Wikipedia). He deserved a lot more credit for playing such a difficult role without making the lead seem irritating or unbelievable.<br/><br/>Ending on a sad note, unless it is watched on a yearly basis it probably won't be the chin-scratcher it was when you first ever saw it, so do make the most of it even if means you have scream at a feather dropping because it interrupted your viewing."

Naivety is a quality I possess but a story told backwards with a revolution surrounding a short term memory condition and corrupting it with a fast flowing clue dropping narrative? Well, whatever the awards shelf has, this is by far one of the best plot devices ever devised.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce is strong enough to dive deep into his character's mental agony and carries the film's muddled plot on his shoulders, given the character a sharp and jittery edge that was necessary to generate the harsh nature of the mental handicap. Carrie-Anne Moss shines through a multi persona that gives off a great twist. Joe Pantoliano always seems to have a knowledge of access into great films with small roles. The Matrix, Risky Business, The Goonies and The Fugitive and his sharp voice cascades here to with his perfectly portrayed figure of either good or bad in the film's context that has many twists and turns and together with Pearce and Moss, reinstalls a feeling of corruption amongst friends and anonymous faces.<br/><br/>Filming in black and white for the flashback sequences are a stroke of genius as the mood and tone feel appropriate to distinguish how Leonard is dealing with the past and his current state of mind, particularly when on the phone.<br/><br/>Nolan appropriately uses a feeling of isolation and drama to gain a vibe of paranoia and clue dropping simulation to gain the ultimate film watching experience, collecting fast paced action sequences with dramatic implications that would also appear in his later films and thanks to his brother's terrific novel, makes one of the finest crime thrillers you will ever see, a true marvel."

The story revolves around the themes of murder and suspense but is a path breaking work because the protagonist is a person afflicted with a mental ailment which hinders his brain from behaving and charting out normal plans .<br/><br/>The structure of this movie is finely detailed and innovative. The storyline moves back and forth linking the entire storyline .<br/><br/>The dilemmas and problems faced by the protagonist are dealt with in a cool and methodical manner.<br/><br/>I also was quite deeply impressed by the periodical references to the Protagonists professional life and experiences prior to the onset of the ailment.<br/><br/>The movie can by all means be a manual for all students who want to understand the essentials of movie making. Each sequence is complete in itself in that it takes care of the essential elements of any feature.<br/><br/>The most intriguing part of the screenplay were the monological sequences involving Pearce.<br/><br/>A movie which is undoubtedly complex yet brilliant. The way all the elements have been treated makes it a great piece of work in experimental direction.<br/><br/>Leaving some questions open for interpretation it is for me a wonderfully directed movie which requires an intelligent viewership to be a\fully appreciated."

","The picture is clear, a man has just been killed. His killer is holding the picture, he shakes it, the picture get's dimmer, he shakes it again, the picture is almost white, he shakes it again, and there is no more picture. The killer proceeds to put the picture back into the camera. Confused? This first scene lays down the basic structure of this brilliant movie, and that brilliant structure is based off one question. How can an audience relate to a man with sever short term memory loss? The answer is to start from the end, end at the beginning.<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby, an insurance fraud agent who's last night of his regular life is seeing his wife dying in front of him, and he's helpless to do anything about it. He wakes up every day with that image, and he is determined to kill the man who put it there. With the help of his friend Teddy, he works to track down the killer. The only thing is, he has this condition, after a period of time, usually ranging around 7-10 minutes, he forgets everything. So how does one acquire a friend, when he can't even remember them meeting? It's a good question with one hell of an answer.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie with absolutely amazing performances all around. Joe Pantoliano, is wonderful as Teddy, always trying to push Leonard down one path, Carrie Anne Moss is phenomenal as Natalie, she seems to care for Leonard, but in this movie nothing is as it seems. The true appraise all goes to Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby.Every scene he is clueless, and usually has to immediately act on instinct, not quite sure how he got there, not quite sure who the guy in the closet is, not quite sure how to get out.<br/><br/>But about this ""gimmick."" This is not a cheap trick to confuse the audience, even though it is, but that's not the intention exactly. It's so we can relate to Leonard's state of mind. He has short term memory loss, would this be a better film if we saw it from the beginning, found out the surprise plot twist immediately, and just went down the classic road of a man who refuses to listen to reason and the results. I don't think so. In fact, that would be awful. I know a lot of people who say it wouldn't be a good film without the ""gimmick,"" but that doesn't make a good movie. All of Tarantino's movies are non linear story lines, but everyone seems to accept that without question.<br/><br/>Chris Nolan does something brilliant here, and we can't get past the ""gimmick"" which is the worst reason to take credit from a movie.

","I didn't really ""get"" the movie until afterwards when I started reading some of the IMDb reviews and board comments. I had heard that the film was done ""backwards"" but it didn't really click for me until I read a bit more. The movie is engaging and it makes you wonder what's going to happen next. In terms of the climax, lots of things cleared up by the time the blacknwhite (forward) and the color (backwards) met up. That's when the movie really started making sense.<br/><br/>There were some gross moments that turned my stomach, but other than that, the violence was tolerable. It wasn't as bad as I was expecting.<br/><br/>Oh,since I did mark it spoiler, I believe that the cop was telling the truth about everything. For a few reasons, one of which was Lenny's memory of giving his wife an insulin shot. By the end, it seemed to me that he made up the story about Jenkins in order to ""deal"" with his role in his wife's death. And then his monologue at the end where he pretty much set up the cop so that he would be the one he went after was creepy. Lenny was pretty dangerous, and if this were real life, it would be scary for someone like him to actually be on the loose."
"honorhorror","9","0","2","30 January 2010"," Are you an ethical person?
","And that's one of the core messages the movie delivered to its audiences. With many twists and thoughts set up in a untraditional manner, Memento is essentially very poignant, depressing and can even be horrifying.<br/><br/>The post-modern style of narrating is really fascinating, if not a bit over-the-top. However, any skepticism about this movie's style being over material is wiped out after the first viewing, if you really get it in the first viewing(which also proves you are cleverer than average). To say that the story in this movie flows backwards is a bit inaccurate because the story is an exploration of the origins of every chapter's confusion and conflicts. Have you ever tried to solve a puzzle because you experienced some terrible trauma? If yes, then Memento could be a very personal experience for you as you relate more and more to the main protagonist. Suppose we are given the tools of Leonard, should we be more competent in making the investigation? Or, are we asking ourselves what's justice and what it takes to be an ethical person? Thinking deep into these questions really made this movie a horror one.<br/><br/>Each time a new character pops up in the screen, you would be puzzled by his/her reason to be present, in later segment of the movie you would know what a big crude lie he/she made for Leonard. You see? It's not up to us to decide we are ethical or not given this scenario. You could start like Teddy who wanted to help to end Leonard's misery by helping him and end like Teddy who's tired of Leonard's revenge game and begin to take advantage of that. You could also start like Natalie who's good at manipulating people's emotions, and then found a guy like Leonard a most valuable asset. The problem is anyone who encountered Leonard's condition will automatically become part of his dysfunction. The problem is, no one deserves to live with his condition, yet no one likes to share his burden and take care of his problem. That could be very morally challenging, especially if you had any family/friend who's not so normal.<br/><br/>Proverbs 4:23, ""Above all else, guard your heart; for it is the wellspring of life."" Memento explores this script backwards, in which situations Leonard twisted himself again and again in pursuit of vengeance. Many people considered the movie a great plot hole because if Leonard really can't remember anything after the assault, how come he remembered he has the condition and the cops wouldn't help investigating the case? In the end, however, this is answered by Teddy that Leonard just remembered those he wanted to remember, which proves Leonard himself might just be a fraud, who's ""physically capable of making new memories"" but would rather choose to lie to himself. You may pity with him because like an autistic person he is suffering. But, it's Leonard who caged himself in the middle of the misery, and wouldn't let himself go. The horrifying message is that there is already no truth for Leonard because everything he thinks that matters would be forgotten in next minute, yet the only truth left for the audience is that with submarine motivations everyone lies just like Leonard and Teddy. However, thanks to the Bible which tells us people CAN choose to lie or to tell the truth(even mentally-challenged person like Leonard). Notably, Memento doesn't follow popular philosophies and wasn't so ignorant about that fact.<br/><br/>9/10, very impressive and compelling, needed instructions for young audiences."

At least, that's what Mr. Pearce believes. According to his reality, his wife was raped and beaten to death. Pearce survived, but with no short term memory. According to the film's official synopsis, it's ""a rare brain disorder - the inability to form any new memories. 'Lenny' can remember in detail everything that happened before his injury, but anyone he has met or anything he has done since that fateful night, simply vanishes.""<br/><br/>Certainly, this rare brain disorder (""anterial-grade memory loss"") was picked because there is no danger of an advocate group of sufferers forming to proclaim this film does not accurately represent their plight.

","For the first time in nearly nine years since its release, ""I had the opportunity to watch Christopher Nolan's authentic masterpiece, ""Memento"", which to this date holds a special place in my heart. Guy Pearce throws himself into his part as Leonard Shelby, a man who has suffered from a short-term memory loss. Shelby can reminisce the past, but his amnesia forces him to not recall any recent memories.<br/><br/>Shelby depends on tattoos to keep him on track of things and may lead up to finding his wife's killer and the person who's responsible for his memory loss. Shelby also sports photographs of people, his motel and his car as a way to potentially retrace his memory. <br/><br/>As I mentioned before, this movie was excellent and the man behind it all is the British born director Christopher Nolan who should have bagged in some awards along the way. What's original about this movie is that the film's events are reversed. Nolan's intentions are to trace a scene from the past, which are featured in black and white. After the scene closes, the present scenes return in colour. The following scene will conclude the way the previous scene concludes. It's hard to explain, you just have to see it for yourselves to get the idea. <br/><br/>Other strong notables in this movie are Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano who turn in equally compelling performances. The twists delivered by Nolan are out to make you go bonkers, but as the film progresses, the journey into the past will lead you to incredible discoveries revealed. Shelby's memory loss is so bad he would be the type of person to befriend a man who may have pick-pocketed him. Then after a while, he'll forget that he was pick-pocketed only if he writes it down to remember what just happened. <br/><br/>The black and white sequences are placed to turn back the clocks to past events that lead up to the story. <br/><br/>It's not all entirely serious though, there are some funny moments like when Shelby meets Teddy (Pantoliano) frequently and he ventures out to find people who may know him and his mental condition even though he knows what his state of mind is already. When watching the movie, we gradually grow on Shelby and realize that this man lives on repeated events that continually linger on in his mind. Everyday he thinks his wife's death was just recent. I know it's sad to see a person live a life like that, but the character study is very involving and we all hope for a miracle and that we hope he can get his full memory back. It's a bit odd that the events are told backwards, but it was still executed to perfection and succeeds to keep the audience motivated. <br/><br/>Overall it was a crowd-pleasing success and the twists are handled subliminally. The reversed scenes were brilliant and original and the characters are a pleasure to watch. The direction by Christopher Nolan was both crisp and immaculate with an unorthodox method to his madness."

","Indeed, why not??? I mean, regardless of the editing, which will be in the future looked upon with appreciation and jealousy, the movie is absolutely stunning...<br/><br/>Guy Pearce makes, as usual, the audience believe his feelings are genuine. He is able to transmit to the people watching every bit of anxiety, lack of trust and desire for the truth his character feels, doing it in a manner making you want to see the movie again and again.<br/><br/>THE MAIN QUESTION is: what if the movie were edited in the ""traditional"" manner? Would it have been less appealing? Well, it's a hard question to answer.<br/><br/>Mainly because the editing goes strictly linked to the title and the condition of the leading character, but also helps you in a very subtle manner to transcend from the position of viewer to the one of a character in the movie... It helps you identify to the character and beyond...<br/><br/>Maybe a slight reminder of the ""Fugitive"" theme, that only makes one appreciate both these films...<br/><br/>As for the cast, it is a work of genius. There are so many angles that could be debated here! Beginning with the talent Guy Pearce shows when playing roles of people with very troubled minds and lives, one can only speculate the very interesting idea of bringing 2 of the stars of the first installment of ""Matrix"" around for another challenging movie.<br/><br/>Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano really make even here a great team. Their characters have quite the same ""talent"" of apeearing to be ""good"" people, but being in fact very cool, calculated manipulators of people. They do prey on the leading characters ""disability"" and they do it in a very effective manner, until a certain point.<br/><br/>Why ""disability""? Well, because even the character played by Guy Pearce uses it as a weapon of some sorts and at the ""end"" of the film we see to what effect.<br/><br/>What can I say besides: Enjoy!"

The amount of debate about the movie, the story and plot, the actual disease and how things turn out create for discussions that still go on till today.

","This is my second viewing of 'Memento' since it debuted in 2000 and I have the same feelings about it: masterpiece, original, great dialogue, wonderful concept and extremely well acted. And since 2000, hardly any other movie has come close to the brilliance this movie has shown. What other movie has been played backward? 'Memento' starts off with a murder and works its way carefully and uniquely backwards through a mystery a man with no short-term memory and an audience must solve. Pearce plays the main character completely convincingly as does co-stars (and 'Matrix' co-stars) Moss and Pantoliano. A man stricken with no short-term memory after an accident must put together pieces of a puzzle after his wife gets murdered, so he can get revenge. Along the way he meets and re-meets people who might be aiding his quest, all the while we learn certain people are extremely dangerous. I can't say enough, I LOVED this movie. Everything worked for it, and finally a movie (not a dumb summer popcorn movie, sorry 'Transformers') makes me use my brain. You really have to think, take little breaks and pay attention. I admired the episode of 'Seinfeld' when they did the same thing (one of the series best episodes ever) – and that was the only other work I can think of that used this concept: telling the story backwards. Sure, you can like big-budgeted movies, but they hardly ever show the respect that director Christopher Nolan did during this feature. Ironically, Nolan also directed the big-budgeted, latest 'Batman' adventures. Guess what? They're 100x better than the previous four. This man knows what's good and how to show it. Sit back, listen to every word spoken or unspoken and enjoy one of the best mysteries, or simply, best movies ever made."

"Det_McNulty","8","0","2","9 October 2008"," Cryptic Storytelling That Somehow Works
","Little known director Christopher Nolan almost instantaneously claimed his place as one of modern cinema's most innovative directors when he released Memento to almost unanimous recognition. It caught the attention of many critics and filmmakers alike, establishing itself as something in the realms of ""cinematic literature."" It was a work that marked the appeal of new-wave noir, more commonly known as neo-noir. Not only this, but its alternate take on nonlinear narrative storytelling was a breath of fresh-air to the overuse of non-linear concepts that had aroused during the 1990s.<br/><br/>Starring Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, Memento tells the story of Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce), a man suffering from short-term memory loss following the murder of his wife. Following his wife's tragic death, Leonard begins seeking revenge on whoever murdered his wife, slowly piecing together clues with the help of a mysterious ""detective"" figure, named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Due to the memory condition he suffers from, Leonard has great difficulty collecting information and relies on tattoos and constant note taking to record his findings. Soon after, another questionable character is introduced, this being Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss), and like with Teddy her origins are practically unknown. A web of ambiguity and distrust soon entangles Leonard, never knowing if either Teddy or Natalie are genuine.<br/><br/>The narrative carefully revolves around these three central characters, playing out incidents in seemingly alternate realities and reverse chronology. It is the editing that enables the viewer to experience a similar sensation as Leonard, by essentially jumbling scenes, splicing colour footage of his investigation alongside black and white moments where Leonard is discussing an insurance case of a man who also claimed to suffer from short-term memory loss. It is these moments specifically, which reveal the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of Leonard, essentially painting the man's past. Memento cannot be classed as a mystery, such a term sounds far too throwaway; rather, it is more a vengeance/chase flick, but even placing it in such a category seems somewhat derogatory.<br/><br/>As noir goes, Memento does incorporate many of the distinctive elements; including voice-over, noticeable use of shadow, nihilistic themes and low-key lighting. The characters are very noir, as each one has a certain shady quality to their personality and hints at having ulterior motives. It is these things that make the film so thrilling, even on any revisit. Still, there are a few gripes I have, such as the reverse narrative being somewhat of a gimmicky disguise for a simple plot. Additionally, the plot becomes almost too convoluted at times, with a sense of repetition resulting in moments of complete perplexity. Then again, the perplexity is arguably a great feature for it allows the viewer becomes increasingly more agitated, and almost begs for your concentration.<br/><br/>The multiple narrative techniques used in Memento allow the intrigue to expand as the story progresses, and in a relentless manner that does not eschew till the climatic moments. As films about memory go, this is definitely one of the best depictions of memory trauma and obsession in recent years. It pulls all the necessary gears that craft an absorbing cinematic venture, and not only that but it explores the psyche of a man whose perception of reality has been completely disfigured. Combining the thoughts and actions through a voice-over and reverse narrative is an exceptionally difficult thing to conquer through writing; therefore the screenplay deserves much credit. In fact, the story was adapted from a novella by Christopher Nolan's brother Jonathan, entitled Memento Mori that was essentially an essay on memory and the individual's perception of reality.<br/><br/>An important element of Memento is the idea of recollection and how we often subconsciously chose the way we recollect one moment from the next. During the film, there is a scene where Leonard expresses how humans cannot rely on memory. In addition, paradoxes such as the notion of Leonard not remembering to forget his wife are in effect an example of what would cure his grief. Performance wise, the film is pretty much incredible, with the exception of some moments of sketchy wit uttered by the actors. It is Guy Pearce who steals the show though, proving that he can hold a film together, in what is his best performance since 1997's L.A. Confidential. As a viewer, I could feel great empathy for his character, acknowledging the difficulties associated with memory loss and the way in which one conceals memories through tragedy. This is a contemporary work not to be missed and remains the most important role of Nolan's ever growing career. In my opinion, he has come close to surpassing the film with his excellent takes on the Batman saga, but that is a different story entirely."

","What if you woke up in a motel room with almost no memory of getting there? You look at your surroundings, and it appears as if you are supposed to be there. You see the room keys. You see your personal items. You see car keys. It looks like you checked in, but you do not remember doing so. And you see pictures and notes that appear to have been created by you, but you have no memory of the moment of their creation. You only have a vague sense that you did them. This is the dilemma of Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce in maybe the role of his career. Leonard's problem is simple but makes his life more complicated than most people could ever comprehend. He has lost his short-term memory capabilities. Every subsequent situation in his life seems born anew as if nothing came before it.<br/><br/>Each scene is presented in a way that allows the viewer to experience, more or less, this dilemma. Shelby sees people, buildings, and cars, but is not sure how they relate to him. And he uses little mementos, photographs and notes, to remind him not only who they are but how they relate to him, hence the title. What others might use to simply enhance their existing memory, like photos, Shelby uses to function. And he's trying to solve a mystery: to find the murderer of his wife.<br/><br/>A highly original and surreal film that lacks comparison. There is simply no film quite like it. For those who believe that Hitchcock's work is the pinnacle of suspense, you haven't seen the potential of the genre until you've experienced ""Memento"". And it all works largely because of the tour-de-force performance by Guy Pearce, the equally superb acting by the supporting cast, and the incredible writing and directing of Christopher Nolan, based on a short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan. The film also forces you to learn how to watch it as the story is not told in a traditional linear style. But I'll keep the door shut on that as you'll have to be the one to open it. And please do. The surprises behind the door of Memento are definitely worth the effort of unlocking its secrets."

","Some films have an intriguing premise but don't deliver on it. Christopher Nolan's Memento delivers in spades!<br/><br/>The story of a man searching for his wife's killer but unable to retain any short term memories is obviously intriguing. Nolan adds twists by telling the story in reverse and having our ""hero"" aid his memory with tattoos and instant photos.<br/><br/>By the end of the film the viewer's head is spinning and we don't know what to make of the previous 90 minutes. Thank God for rewind buttons on DVD remotes!<br/><br/>The film is about memory. Nolan brilliantly plays with the viewer's own memory. At first we feel sympathy for Leonard, trying to piece together enough information from his disabled memory to get revenge on his wife's murderer. At the conclusion we realise that in the course of the film we may have played tricks on our own memories. Were the assumptions we made in following the story completely wrong? Were our sympathies misplaced?<br/><br/>A lot of the film hangs on the performance of Guy Pearce in the main character and he is brilliant. Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are also excellent in the main supporting roles. <br/><br/>Quite simply, one of the best films of the last ten years. You have to watch it!"
"jackharding89-1","10","0","3","22 August 2008"," Nolan's dizzyingly highbrow noir smash remains beyond compare
","In his debut feature Following, Christopher Nolan demonstrated a lucid fondness for film noir sensibility. Using fractured time sequences, delirious flashbacks and a reflective narration to illustrate an anti-hero's perilous obsession with following strangers, Following incorporated a variety of props, things and fragments of décor in the noir iconography that were underscored, naturally, by the film's 16mm black-and-white stock. These narrative and visual ambiguities would serve Nolan well in Memento. The cerebral psycho' thriller that would (1) defy the conventions of narrative cinema, (2) throw up a marvellous prism of manifold meanings and interpretations and (3) become a full-fledged classic of modern cinema.<br/><br/>With its wrong-way-round narrative structure, Memento is a maze-like, many-mirrored movie that's designed to absolutely stump the viewer. It's an often dark, sometimes light affair without a sense of time or place and without an air of fidelity or even resolution.<br/><br/>Beginning with the end, Memento, put simply, is a revenge tale in reverse that maps out onetime claims investigator Leonard Shelby's (Guy Pearce) path to kill the man who brutally raped and murdered his wife. The plot is not configured in this manner to merely show-off, though. There is a reason. For during the attack, Leonard suffered a costly blow to the head which rid him of his ability to make new memories. Don't confuse this with amnesia, though. He remembers everything prior to the incident, just nothing after. Imagine something along the lines of short-term memory loss. Alas, Leonard's forced to place what little trust he has in pictures of people and places as well as personal notes and tattoos that serve as reminders with regard to his progression in his manhunt.<br/><br/>Leonard's disability is pretty much beyond comprehension. Nolan demands via the fragmentally restricted narrative that we attempt to twig it on some level though. Which is why the plot make-up serves as kind of empathizer between us and Leonard. We're deliberately made to feel as confused as he is, so much so to the point that you'll begin to question your own views regarding every motive, detail, scene and character, Leonard included.<br/><br/>Opening with an extreme close up of a Polaroid un-developing, Memento's pattern of narrative progression is best described in terms of the film being divided into two main visual and stylistic categories.<br/><br/>The colour sequences take a subjective view on Leonard's quest as we witness the events that lead to the incident in the opening scene in reverse order. Each of these sequences, however, are spliced with objective, documentary-like monochrome sequences of Leonard discussing the details of his condition, his investigation and experience with a former client who suffered from a condition similar to his. These black and white scenes would appear to be in chronological order but at what point in the tale are they taking place? After the events in colour? Before? During? It's purpose in time does become apparent towards the end, well it's really the beginning but whatever- the final transition from chrome to colour is quite sublime.<br/><br/>The beginning of each coloured segment, then, acts as the end of the next. So every time a colour sequence is interrupted by a black and white one, the following colour sequence will map-out how Leonard got to the start of the colour sequence you saw last. Sounds confusing and believe me- it is, but you can't help but marvel at the film's ingenious scope and after a half hour or so, you'll all but get the hang of it.<br/><br/>Underpinning the film, in true noir style, is Pearce's unreliable yet commonsensical narration which guides us through the ground-breaking noir labyrinth with a cool and sometimes satirical tone. On his backwards journey, we encounter a variety of dodgy characters who appear to be out to support Leonard just as much as con him. From shady cop Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) to barmaid Natalie right down to motel clerk Burt, everyone appears to be out to exploit Leonard's condition on some level to reek their own benefits, Leonard included.<br/><br/>Sprinkled with sardonic moments and noir-esquire wit, the ambiguous script and performances further invite viewers to piece together a puzzle they may never be able to fully solve. And for this air of blissful uncertainty, Nolan has Pearce and Pantoliano to thank a great deal. How do you play a character with no memory? No ark? Spontaneously, I guess. Whatever the Aussie's methods- his performance within the role of Leonard is unforgettable. A poor choice of words, perhaps, but it's an appropriate lexicon when looking at Pearce's emotionally tangled performance. Honesty within dishonesty, idiocy within intelligence, Pearce's chameleonic quality means sheer purpose in a three-piece-suit which breathes new life to the cinematic anti-hero. As for Pantaliano, the casting of the coveted actor renowned with antagonistic roles is one of the film's numerous masterstrokes. Comical, deviant, sarcastic, cunning- Pantaliano's Teddy is an ideal metaphor for ambivalence- he's as much the anti-villain as Leonard is the 'hero.<br/><br/>Adapted from brother Jonathan's short story Memento Mori, Christopher Nolan's Memento could've been far too clever for its own good. That's a fact. But it isn't. OK, it throws up all kinds of riddles at the end, many of which will invite numerous answers and interpretations. This, though, is the mark of any good thriller- film noir or not. You know the kind of film that after watching, you just can't help but watch again? That's Memento. The kind of film you'll find yourself yapping about to friends, colleagues and complete strangers for months on end? Memento. The film that whenever you hear its name, you'll be quick to join the conversation, offering your opinions and views. You see where I'm going with this. Christopher Nolan's irresistible indie labyrinth is a bona-fide masterpiece of modern cinema that proves impossible to forget. It's a film like no other that remains, in my opinion, unparallelled in terms of style and originality since its release some 8 years ago."

","Mind-bending. Time-altering. Disorienting. Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is a dark and bleak experience, an ingenious picture that stares into the soul of a man filled with vengeance and anger. A movie that begs to be seen more than once, 'Memento' is as confusing as it is thoughtful, as bizarre as it is brilliant. An engrossing story that pulls us into the driver's seat and never takes its foot off the gas, this is modern film-making at its best. And once again, Nolan proves why he is one of the best filmmakers of our time.<br/><br/>'Memento' doesn't wait to build the tension before showing us what ultimately happens in the end. It's how the movies begins. The fragmented storytelling keeps the film a perplexing mystery, we see what Guy Pearce sees, one confusing episode after another. It keeps us on the edge of our seat, certain of how everything is wrapped up but without any knowledge of the twists and turns that bring us to this very unsettling circumstance. Christopher Nolan's inspired vision is impeccable, but it is Dody Dorn's editing that makes 'Memento' the non-linear masterpiece that it is instead of one jumbled piece of incoherence.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce finds himself in a wonderfully complex role, a haunted man who has many different layers but can't retain short-term memory for more than a few minutes. He delivers a brilliant performance, and most importantly, makes it absolutely believable. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano turn in great supporting roles as their own characters have secrets that unravel before our eyes. 'Memento' is often a frustrating viewing experience, but a mind-blowing one at that. You can't possibly pick up on all the subtleties and details during a single sitting, which makes 'Memento' a rich and rewarding movie many times through.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
"Red_Identity","Null","0","2","25 July 2008"," One of the best films of the decade!
","I just watched this film, and having seen another film done by Christopher Nolan, the Prestige, this film is just as bizarre, if not more...<br/><br/>I will start off with the writing. It is a very complicated, thought-out screenplay. Us having to wonder throughout the whole film why the character of Leonard kills a certain man, 'John G' gives us a reason to watch the film. This film is just like a puzzle. It gives you bits and bits, and it gives you real life memories that Leonard cannot himself remember. It starts off, and it had me worried, since these types of films can only do so much to solve the puzzles. The writing is consistently strong, as the film goes along, we are able to finally see how Leonard meets all these characters, and how he interacts with them. Well, the film is not only helped by its puzzling screenplay, but also by stand-out performances. Guy Pearce, this is the second film in which I have seen he stars in, and I know enough to say that he is a very underrated actor. His character has to carry the whole film, and his performance is consistently strong. His plays his character with grace, with confusion, and with emotion and force to do what he is willing to do to get revenge. The supporting performances are also all stand-out. Carrie-Ann Moss plays her mixed character amazingly. In one scene particularly, when she and Leonard have their only 'fight', well, her acting I thought was Oscar-worthy. It was also nice to see Joe Pantoliano be in this film. I have seen some of his work in The Sopranos, and in this film he really gives his character or Teddy a realistic touch, he gives him personality. I also thought some brief performances, like Stephen Tobolowsky, another TV star, I thought he did very well. Another great thing was the film editing. i can truly say it is amazing, and it makes the film feel fast-paced, yet complicated and never boring. The musical score was also settling, and was a very nice tone to the whole film.<br/><br/>Now, this is a sort of a film you have to figure out, and about the ending, I am still a bit confused, and I can tell before I visit more fan topics about this film, that some people will absolutely HATE the ending. I don't hate it, but i think it works in both positive and negative ways. The negative is that it was not the final 'revelation' that films like these usually have. It wasn't really similar to The Prestige, with a big twist, and I thought needed to have one. BUT at the same time, it was a huge twist. The ending I do appreciate, because Nolan was not just trying to just tell a 'amnesia' thriller type film he was trying to say something more, and he succeeded. Now I can view as the main character, Leonard, as being both sort of crazy and alive. I think what the ending meant was that Leonard really needed a reason to live, because of his wife's death. That is why he will continue to create puzzles for himself. In a way, I appreciate film-making like this, but I do have my usual complaints.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film not to be missed. I had never heard of it, and I think after seeing a couple of Nolan films, it proves he is at the top of being the most original, complexing, 'alive' director(Note- i have yet to see The Dark Knight) I will try to purchase this film, I think it deserves a repeat viewing, especially since the ending didn't reveal 'too' much... Anyways, a thought-out independent film, one that I think should be remembered in years to come. Definitely among the best of the decade"

","Memento 6-30-08<br/><br/>Memento's is structured such that each scene in its primary narrative takes place chronologically after the following scene. Essentially the film runs, for lack of a better phrase, backward. Now in any other flick this would seem a bit gimmicky. A way to hide the fact that the movie essentially doesn't have much going for it other than its quarky narrative structure. Though Memento just happens to feature a protagonist that suffers short term memory loss. So our hero is constantly feeling disjointed, not knowing how exactly how he got where he is or what exactly his next move should be. Its one thing to use this condition as a plot device, its an all together different thing to try and put the audience in the shoes of said protagonist. Are you a bit confused while watching Memento, at times yes...but so is the hero. I find this to be a rather brilliant gimmick, if you add this to all the other brilliant exercises in rock solid film making you get one heck of a neo-noir masterpiece."

","If you compare both films you realize how similar they are. Both of the lead male character's have a disability, both lead roles are involved with a woman who s lying to them, both leading men want to solve what went wrong before their accident, and the pacing of both films is very similar; sort of slow, but not boring at all, and thought provoking. Christopher Nolan is one the best directors to emerge from the 21st century. As an aspiring director it's great too see that Nolan can make a brilliant indie classic like Memento and then do great big budget commercial films like Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight and not loose any credibility, in fact I think The Dark Knight probably earned him more respect even though he had a huge budget for it. The Movie has it's little holes, but I get passed it because it so creative in every way, especially in it's structure of storytelling and narrative similar to Taxi Driver. The film has a noir feel to it which I love. It asks questions about satisfying our needs emotionally by lying too ourselves and I think shows how the need for revenge can be taken advantage of by other people. Nolan's favorite films are Cinatown, Blade Runner, Lawrence Of Arabia, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Chiantown and 2001 are number one and two on my list and the other two are definitely in my top 50 or 30. Love Nolan, love this film, one of the best five films of the decade."

","MEMENTO (2001) **** Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Larry Holden, Jorja Fox, Stephen Tobolowsky, Harriet Sansom Harris. Intricately unravelling, disjointed piece of pulpy neo-noir that focuses on short-term memory victim/anti-hero Leonard Shelby (Pearce in one humdinger of a role) who is avidly trying to find the man who raped and murdered his wife (Fox in flashbacks) but trying desperately to maintain his own scattershot recollections of things past and current, particularly the latter as he finds himself holed up in a seedy hotel, befriended by possible femme fatale Moss and weasel cop Pantoliano (both excellently skewering the plot aloing nicely) and coming to terms with his own sanity. Brilliantly conceived by novice filmmaker Christopher Nolan (who adapted his brother Jonathan's short story ""Memento Mori"") weaves back and forth with storytelling devices at full throttle including flashback, piecemeal clues and red herrings abound and more tellingly the ingenuous use of editing and the adrenaline pumped consequences the film unspools with great elan and aplomb. One of the best indies in quite some time and original in its execution is only superseded by a heartfelt and justifiably innate turn by Pearce - who adds some black humor liberally when needed - whose identity is in flux from the get go. One of the year's best films, bar none. My favorite: the foot chase sequence when Pearce can't figure out if he is the pursuer or pursuee!"

","Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, a man who a has short term memory loss and needs to keep memento's around to remind him of what he did just minutes prior. Christopher Nolan beautifully interlaces human anti-trust into the script and reveals scene by scene an ugly and distorted mess that our lead guy Shelby had to endure due to his condition. Some of the madness that happens is due to Shelby's memory loss and the rest is pretty much his so called friends (who he slowly finds out like 'Teddy') are not to be trusted at all. For my first viewing I was amazed, usually it takes more than one viewing to pick it all up and understand it but I stuck my face in front of my TV for an hour and a half and paid very close attention to the scene development (which I think was just a superb idea of genius on director Nolans behalf). I would recommend this movie to anyone alive and breathing, it definitely has a ton of symbolism and best yet, its a thinking-persons movie. A+ 9/10 stars should suffice. Unlike Leonard Shelby in the movie, we the viewer have to use OUR memories in order to piece everything together, brilliant."

","A lot of filmmakers have gotten their big breaks on the foundation of films that are, upon closer inspection, more stylistic than substantive...and while there's nothing wrong with an overly stylistic film, its accolades can erode with the passage of time, especially if there isn't much under the glossy surface. What's interesting about Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is how its stylistic touches are synthesized within the narrative itself; furthermore, the backwards-flowing narrative also becomes an extension of our protagonist's robotic, detached, and ""system""-oriented way of living. Guy Pearce plays Leonard, an average man who loses his short-term memory after his wife is murdered, and embarks on a quest to catch and kill the guy who did it; he holes up in a fleabag motel, tattoos clues on his body, encounters a downtrodden bartender (Carrie-Anne Moss) and a man claiming to be a cop (Joe Pantoliano), all while flashing back to a extended phone conversation wherein he tells the tale of a man with a similar condition. As played by Pearce, Leonard is like a postmodern vision of the 1940s noir detective, a perceptive Everyman driven to find closure; his performance is properly detached, only randomly showing traces of normality, but Nolan's structure cleverly plays like a visual extension of Leonard's mental processes, putting us in the midst of his search. Moss provides solid support (and sheds her ""Matrix"" persona gracefully) as the noirsih femme fatale, and Pantoliano keeps us guessing as the mysterious ""Teddy."" While many other films have borrowed ""Memento""'s structure since, few have made it feel so justifiably vital to the credibility of the plot overall--to ""start"" at the very end of a story and move backward to the beginning is a daring move, and Nolan is confidently aware of how the preceding events truly gives the conclusion its impact."
"Otoboke","Null","0","3","27 September 2007"," Not as good as it's made out be, sadly.
","I was quite disappointed in Memento, what with all the praise it has had since its release in 2000 and its coveted 27th spot in the IMDb top 250. I have also enjoyed two of Christopher Nolan's other later films, so when it came to watching Memento, it was safe to say my expectations were high.<br/><br/>I don't know though, memento just didn't click with me, i found it interesting for the most part and yes it held my attention, but it lacked any feeling. I mean, the main character has lost his wife, he's out trying to get revenge, but do we see any remorse or grievances from him? Nope, nowhere in Memento is it to be found. In fact, there's hardly any emotion at all present with the exception of the odd burst of unconvincing anger. This distinct lack of heart is what kills an otherwise intelligent and well constructed film.<br/><br/>The way in which it truly strikes hard at the movie's core is through the characters and their remarkably dull and uninteresting nature. It's not just the writing either, performances were rather mundane and unremarkable throughout with the odd exception here and there from Pantoliano and Tobolowsky. In fact I wasn't interested in any of the characters bar Leonard, but only because I wanted to know who the real killer was. Now when it got to this actual 'climatic' in the story, a lot of people probably loved the twist, but I didn't enjoy it at all and found it terribly anticlimactic. When the credits started rolling, I genuinely felt unfulfilled, which i realise may have been the point regarding how the character eventually feels at this point but I didn't buy it. I felt as if the entire movie had headed towards a solution that was surprising yes, but not all surprises are nice ones. This was a sucker punch and a half.<br/><br/>I have to say, I did enjoy the backwards narration of the story. It suited the theme of memory loss well and there is a scene where Leonard questions his wife reading a book that she had read numerous times before that basically gets to the point of why the story is told this way. There was the odd drag in the middle section of the film where scenes were sometimes cut a little too soon and frequently, most notably the ones involving the character 'Dobb'. As a narration style however, it was a completely original and fresh way to tell a tale.<br/><br/>As a whole, memento isn't a bad movie, it is actually quite good but that's all. There's nothing genuinely remarkable or memorable except the narration style, but then again maybe that was Nolan's intention."

Who would like to find this new style out himself, reads on only with the next to last paragraph. <br/><br/>The special at the film: There is two different story lines, one in color those told the story by the end to backwards and one to black-and-white those told the story from the outset forward, the end of the film is the point where both story lines meets. <br/><br/>In order to anticipate the story not too much: It concerns Leonard (Lenny) on the search for the murderer of his wife is, however suffers him after her death an illness: He cannot note facts, therefore he tries to remember again and again with photos and notes <br/><br/>Result: A fantastic modern thriller, in which definitely no boredom arises and whose background too obviously is not to be checked up."
"DavidSim240183","10","0","2","18 July 2007"," Superb direction. Endless surprises. An utter classic!
","The opening scenes of Memento show a hand holding a photograph. Its one of these photos that instantly develop. The hand shakes it a few times. But oddly, instead of getting clearer, the picture fades. Only for that same photo to go back into a camera. Not out. The whole sequence is played backwards. And sets the tone perfectly for the film you're about to see. Memento may be a bit taxing on the old brain cells but its also one of the cleverest, and most ingenious films to come out of Hollywood in a good long while.<br/><br/>Memento is an extremely unusual film because of the approach director Christopher Nolan takes. Its a story that starts at the end and ends at the beginning. In this case we watch a man being killed, and then watch the story work its way back from there. Its an extremely odd approach that shouldn't even begin to work but surprisingly does. It adds whole new dimensions to modern film-noir, and transforms Memento into a true original. As well as a classic.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Leonard. A man who has lost his wife. And his identity. Leonard doesn't know who murdered her. Or anything else for that matter. Because a blow to the head has given him an odd sort of amnesia. He can remember everything about his life up until his wife's murder. He's incapable of sustaining short-term memories. He could meet a person and forget the reason for talking to them all within the space of the same conversation.<br/><br/>And when you're trying to find your wife's killer, memory loss is not exactly an ally. Instead Leonard has to rely upon tattooing important clues to his body. Or noting judgements and instincts on snapshots of different faces and places.<br/><br/>Before you actually sit down to watch Memento, it might be helpful for you to know something beforehand about the film's approach to storytelling. It will make it much easier to follow. Memento is made up of several continuous interconnecting vignettes. It could begin with Leonard walking into a hotel and killing a man. And then backtrack to how Leonard got to that hotel in the first place. This is the dynamic that propels the film, and once you've figured that out, Memento is not (quite) as hard to follow.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan's direction is exceptional. For someone who was only just starting out as a filmmaker, he displays an astonishing knowledge of narrative structure. And because he's dealing with whole new aspects of storytelling, it makes his accomplishments that much more remarkable. And the way he follows the story backwards at little pieces at a time is amazing the way different surprises keep being sprung on us.<br/><br/>I'm hesitant to tell you too much because the film dazzles by the different narrative somersaults it constantly pulls off. This is a film that will shock and surprise right up until the very end.<br/><br/>Memento is an exhausting film at times. You may feel tempted to turn off the DVD more than once just so your brain can catch up. If you feel the need, by all means do so. Its Nolan's way of making us feel just as confused and as dislocated as poor Leonard. Its a sometimes gruelling experience, but in the long run it works.<br/><br/>The film would be nothing without the right actor at the centre of it to pull everything together. And Guy Pearce is perfectly cast in the role. He has an infinite patience, playing a role that must have no doubt been difficult. I don't know if the actual film was shot in sequence, but if it was done backwards then it shows Pearce is an actor with real talent. He was criminally overlooked at Oscar time.<br/><br/>There are lots of wonderful gems to pry out of this film. I love the scene that begins with a chase. And Leonard can't remember if he's being chased. Or if he's the one doing the chasing. Or when a character claims to have been beaten up by her boyfriend. She uses Leonard's memory impairment against him. Because the next scene reveals it was he who actually did it.<br/><br/>Memento reminds me at times of Groundhog Day. Where that was a man surrounded by a world that constantly resets, this is a man who constantly resets surrounded by a world that always moves on. Its an ingenious concept. The last time I saw a film that made my mind do so many flip-flops and somersaults was Being John Malkovich.<br/><br/>At the end (or is it the beginning?) of Memento, you will definitely feel completely worn out. And you may feel like you never want to sit through this film ever again. That's understandable, but Memento is a film that deserves repeat viewings, because it just gets better and better every time you see it. Its a completely original, modern day masterpiece.

","So many of us are asking these questions (me too) that I can't resist writing the 1743th comment :) <br/><br/>Q1: I give it an 8 (I give good movies 7-8) but I make the official vote 7 to even out the over-rated 10's. It's a good movie ... for being able to take an attentive viewer to think loud with and think like Lenny. I like the feeling that everything is unreliable and conflicting but not quite, and like Lenny, we're struggling to label and put down all possible hints to give ourselves a ""consistent"" story we can come into terms with (there is no truth ... that's life). I particularly like the debate on distortions of memory and interpretations verses facts, and how even the process of recording can be tailored for our purpose (brief spoiler -- the handwriting). The movie is successful in sharing these good ideas, due to excellent choices in the editing and the filming. It's also somewhat philosophical, giving the movie even a little depth and intellect beyond the regular thrill and entertainment. Not sure why I won't give a 9 ... I guess to score 9-10, a movie has to be good beyond reason, and here, I am still reasoning.<br/><br/>For comparison, Taxi Driver also takes the viewer to feel like Travis, but is more superior to me. Eternal Sunshine debates between over remembering the good and forgetting the painful parts of a relation, but falls short of doing the right job. <br/><br/>Now, the top-250-problem. I agree with many others that the top list is overwhelmed by the lack of criticism and breadth. It still serves a reasonable function to recommend well deserved movies, but the strong bias for ""popular"" movies prevents many other better movies to be brought to the limelight. (How can OK-movies like Pan's Labyrinth, Eternal, or the Departed get so close to Memento???) No one wants to use a top-1000 list, but together with filtering, we can have more versions of the top-list? Just like the filters for the comments, one can view the list with votes from prolific authors, or foreign movies only, or movies below/above a certain budget? Or have different weights to the votes?"
"zsigomiklos","10","0","2","13 July 2007"," One of my all time favs. Flawless.
","I have seen Prestige in the cinema and it awakened my interest in other films directed by Christopher Nolan. Batman Begins was fabulous as well as Memento, the movie that will be remembered as an outstanding piece of art. <br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is that every single scene can be explained because the sequence of the events are put together brilliantly. It is the very movie that you have to watch more than once to bear with all the details in mind.<br/><br/>The message of the movie is something about existence and finding a reason to live as Leonard says towards the end of the film: ""I have to believe that my actions still have meaning...Even if I can't remember them."""
"Mark1988","9","0","2","10 July 2007"," Mind Bending Suspense!
","I can't think of a word to describe Memento. What is entirely original and delightfully complicated? 'Intricate' is a complete understatement in the case of this film. Memento simply grabs the viewer by the throat with these two elements. You'll be astounded by the nuances in the plot and puzzled by the unique way in which the story is assembled.<br/><br/>With that aside, Memento is a film in which the more effort you put into solving the riddle the more pleasure you will get in return. The story itself for those who don't already know, concerns a man who suffers a rare form of short-term memory failure (""It's not amnesia!""). Leonard cannot make new memories, however he still recollects who he is and his goal; track down the murderer of his late wife. This setting opens up some interesting opportunities for the superb direction/writing of Christopher Nolan. Leonard can be manipulated easily and must resort to piecing together his puzzling existence using photos, notes and tattoos. His condition makes the entire film feel like an intricate puzzle with plenty of twists and turns. Fortunately Nolan never lets Memento collapse into a stereotypical whodunit style mystery.<br/><br/>The most important technical aspect of the film is without a doubt the editing. Presumably to allow viewers to experience a world where the present isn't in anyway validated by the past, the time-sequence is inverted kind of. The film presents two stories, one going forward, one backward, one black and white, one color, both involving Leonard while the circumstances in which the two stories take place is left curiously ambiguous. This convoluted structure is the film's greatest asset. This film is nail-biting not because of teenage-fantasy-action but because the fundamental question of 'why did that scene just happen' is never fully answered. The uncertainty and intrigue in every scene is a superb emulation of Leonard's mind-state.<br/><br/>Sound confusing? Good! Memento is a startling original and exhilarating thriller. This movie genuinely deserves its spot in the top-250. The absorbing, troubled and uncertain atmosphere of Memento will definitely stay with you long after the credits roll. An absolute gem."

","This one's delightful. You need to concentrate when you watch it but fortunately it's so well shot and constructed this is not a chore.<br/><br/>The central character has lost his short term memory completely and thus can form no more proper long term memories. His strategy for dealing with this is to make his behaviour habitual and prompted by, for example, Polaroid photos of where he's staying and the people he ""knows"".<br/><br/>All the actors are superb - they make their complex characters seem totally credible which is extraordinary given how odd those characters are.

","After watching this film i was left confused as if i myself was suffering from some sort of mental illness. The film itself uses flashbacks and different segments in a seemingly random order to piece together Leonards short term memory loss and uncover his mystery. I found this style of film making extremely effective and original which was what i enjoyed most about this film rather than the plot itself which i didn't consider special enough to be ranked so high on IMDb's top 250. However this film isn't your average movie and i have never viewed something which plunges as deep into a persons thoughts and you get a real sense of the 'troubled' human mind and what this can lead to. I thought Guy Pearce was excellent in it and produced an almost flawless performance as Leaonard. However i think i found it just to complicated from the 1st viewing to really sit back and enjoy it as a film and will definitely watch it again as i could appreciate the work surrounding this film.

","Yo might think that you forget things often. Maybe you forget a pencil for school, a binder for work, or your car keys when you walk to your car. What if that happened everyday? What if you could never remember anything new? What if you could never remember anything after a certain point in your life? This is how Leonard Shelby feels.<br/><br/>""Memento"" tells the story of Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), who was faced with a terrible incident a a few years back which resulted in his wife's death and his ability to make new, recent memories completely demolished. He does not know for how long, but Leonard has been looking for his wife's killer, a man that he has only seen with a mask over his face. Leonard doesn't know if he has ever killed the man already or he is still looking for him since he can't remember anything new for more than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>To make sure he remembers new, important info, Leonard gets many tattoos all over his body. He believes that writing notes when he has such a severe condition like this would make him very confused, therefore, tattoos make more sense since he sees them everyday. Some of these tattoos say, ""John G did it"" or ""Your wife is dead."" All of this, just to remember what he has to do daily.<br/><br/>The sad part is, Leonard might find this killer. He might have known him forever. But if he ever comes face to face with him, before having seen his tattoos, he won't know what to do since he doesn't know why he is looking or what happened to his wife.<br/><br/>""Memento"" has a very disturbing element to it that is very creative on the Nolan brothers' part. Collaborative writing has never worked out so good and single credit directing...they might be the next Coen brothers.<br/><br/>At this point, the Nolan's had only mad one film prior, 1998's ""Following"" and have since this made ""Insomnia,"" ""Batman Begins,"" and ""The Prestige,"" all great, full-of-twists thrillers.<br/><br/>Their best film definitely is ""Memento"" with it's edge of your seat thrills, camera angles, and great acting. The best part of the film is that it's told in reverse and forwards so you get a sense of what Leonard goes through since you have to remember what happened before and why it connects to what's happening now.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss, and Joe Pantaliano could not have been more perfectly cast as the title characters. Guy Pearce as Leonard, the star, Carrie-Ann Moss, as Natalie, a woman who helps Leonard with his problem since she, like him, has also lost someone close to her. And Joe Pantaliano stars as Teddy, whose identity never seems to be certain throughout the film.<br/><br/>""Memento"" is a definite must-see. It has no flaws whatsoever and should be viewed before anyone's death. It is one of my personal favorite movies and I have yet to meet anyone who hates this film. Trust me, you will not be disappointed."

","I have to come out and say it  over 5 years after watching Christopher Nolan's breakout hit Memento for the first time, I'm still not 100% certain I ""get it"". I can discuss the film and analyze the life out of it, but there will always be huge cheese holes left in my various theories as to what exactly led to our protagonist Leonard's unique situation. A situation that, for those who haven't seen Memento yet (are there any of those left out there?), led to Leonard's devastating loss of ability to process and withhold any kind of short-term memory.<br/><br/>Either way, Nolan's bold choice to tell the story backwards and break the old fashioned linear storytelling is worthy of all the praise it can receive. Compliments also go to Guy Pearce, for creating a compelling character I believe psychiatrists will discuss for years to come. Alongside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Bourne Identity, this is yet another superb 2000's movie to deal with the delicate subject of (loss of) memories, and come out triumphant as a captivating piece of cinema."

He,nor the police,nor the ambulance-men,could have known that Sammy's wife had caused Sammy to overdose her;the autopsy would have shown an overdose of medication,but no-one could/would have known that Sammy's wife had kept re-winding her watch to 3 o'clock to get her jab;and Sammy would not have remembered,because he had no memory .The point is,if I remember correctly,that this is a really memorable film :the viewer is ""bounced"" and ""conned"" so memorably that..

","Memento<br/><br/>...It's a great movie, and everybody should have seen it at least once! And maybe twice to fully understand.... <br/><br/>Stijn Bossink<br/><br/>Well, that is my opinion about the movie Memento, directed by Christopher Nolan in 2000. Like the movie, I also started this review at the end. Right now you might think i'm never going to get myself out of this, but be patient...<br/><br/>Get this; somebody breaks in to your home in the middle of the night, he rapes and kills your wife in the bathroom while you are sleeping (let's just say you are her husband...) While trying to save her, you got a hit to the head and you drop to the ground were you lose conscience.<br/><br/>This is what happens to a guy named Leonard. From the moment of the accident he has no short term memory anymore. All his knowledge before the accident are crystal clear to him, but he just cant make new memories. Assuming his wife got killed by the bugler, you (as a viewer) start to put some pieces together. During the film you'll see a story told in a unexpected time frame, namely backwards! All the scenes are like little pieces of a puzzle, all presented to you in a random order. To keep up with the story, scenes of Leonard are put in between. These scenes are filmed in black and white to make them recognizable. The story gets more complicated with every scene that follows. While on the other hand, you notice to understand more of the events taking place. This is the kind of movie were your own memory gets tested. Therefore you really get the emotion of the main character, who's trying really hard to remember all of these pieces to his great puzzle of life. Leonard does this by gathering facts, and tattooing these on his own body, so he will never lose his most important notes that will bring him to his wife's murderer.<br/><br/>The movie has an interesting way of telling a story. As a viewer you accidentally assume all kinds of facts; about the killer, the hero of the story and his enemies. These fact are proved to be wrong or right as the story continues. Nolan knows how to think out of the box, and he proves this by blending a few complicated story lines into one big puzzle. The movie is filmed in a chronological order, probably to make it easy on the crew. <br/><br/>If you are in for a mind wrecking movie night, go to the video rental and get Memento!<br/><br/>(now go to the top of the text)"

I believe this a great film as it is a real thrill ride and as you watch it you don't have a clue as to what will happen next.

You got a new form of narrative here. You will be pretty exhausted by the end of it. Our main man wears expensive clothes and drives a flash Jaguar around Hopperesque parts of Pasadena and the San Fernando Valley, and yet lives in motel rooms. In voice over this enigma tells us he is hell bent on seeking vengeance the man who raped and killed his wife. But he has another problem, being hit on the head during the incident which haunts him, he suffers a rare form of memory loss. He can remember everything that happened before that but now can only remember and keep up with whats been going on for a few minutes at a time before it deserts him. He often finds himself confused ""Ok so.....what am I doing....ah, I'm chasing this guy. Uh-oh, no, he is chasing me.

The hidden story within the story is almost as entertaining as the movie itself and you can probably watch this movie 7 times and still learn something you didn't know the first time. The only way to watch this movie is to truly put your trust in the great Christopher Nolan and believe that in the end you will knoow everything you need to know... if you try to figure it out the whole time you will truly miss some of the things that make this movie great. the performances are top notch and I really believe this to be Guy Pearce's best performance along with that of L.A. confidential.

Not to say that I am an avid watcher of independent films, it's just that since independent films don't really have a huge financial backing, they have no choice but to focus on things that make up a good film - such as story line, directing, acting, etc. I am happy to say that this film works well under each of these categories.<br/><br/>I have never watched a Guy Pearce film before this - although I had heard of him. I knew about Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss from 'The Matrix'. The cast is obviously not the most high profile in the world and it worked well in a way because this way, the audience really doesn't expect a whole lot either. However, every single character played their position perfectly. Guy Pearce plays his confusion riddled role superbly and Joe Pantoliano play his happy-go-lucky role very well as well. Carrie-Anne Moss also has several memorable scenes from the film.<br/><br/>However, the thing that is really the biggest reason why anyone should go see this film is because of its storyline and its directing. Shooting the entire film as a series of flashbacks is an odd yet very original and interesting way of making this film. There is no doubt in my mind that that is really what makes the whole film special. If we look back at the overall storyline of the film, we might find it interesting but it will not be as memorable. What we do remember is 'how' we got to find out what we did...rather than what really happens.<br/><br/>Overall grade: A+"

","if I were religious I would mouth this very same words as I look in the mirror ""oh my god!"". Its 2006 and there are hardly any good movies BUT the few movies that are made are very very good. The Prestige was one of them and then I heard that the director of this movie made another classic film called memento. I just watched the movie today an hour from this report in my class... What started out as a regular sleeping movie ended up being one of my top ten list of movies. I got so crazy that I got the prof to give me the movie. All I can say is I gotta kick my self for not hearing about this great movie 5 years back. I am a pretty hardcore movie watcher and so when you watch a 'good' movie the idea and plot can easily become stale right after but then there is the artistic point of movie that somehow intensifies the story just cause its delivered to the audience in a very unique way. I am not a big fan of Pulp Fiction but this movie just leaves me with a loss of words. This is every easily a classic movie but I don't know how the rating system works but this a movie that I intend to own. So now go watch if you haven't!"

","This film is rather unique in that it starts at the end, then flashbacks to the beginning, and works its way to the middle. I have never seen a film that did this before. Aside from the storyline, the film has many great highlights. Good performances from Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano. Special effects are decent, though could be improved in some spots. Best parts are during the middle(of the movie running) when he talks about Sammy Jankis, and at the end of the movie, he finds out he's Sammy Jankis. Then there's the moments leading up to it, where Natalie(Carrie Anne Moss) tricks him into beating the crap out of Dodd. Anyways, great movie, go see it."

","Of course, if you look at the rating of the movie on this site, you'll notice an 8.6. Well, this movie surely deserves that rating. This film is a confusing, mind-bending mess.<br/><br/>And I love it.<br/><br/>It starts off with the killing of Teddy, played by scene-stealer Joe Pantoliano. The killer is Leonard Shelby (with a stellar performance by Guy Pearce). The entire scene is played backwards, which echoes the rest of the film's structure.<br/><br/>I'll talk mainly about the performances, and I'll start with Pearce.<br/><br/>Not only does his performance hold up through multiple viewings, but it gets better with each viewing. I'm surprised he didn't get an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>Joe Pantoliano stole every scene he appeared in, no matter if he had dialog or not. He provides some much needed comic relief and lots of humanity.<br/><br/>Carrie-Ann Moss starts off the film as a very sympathetic character, but by the middle, you hate her guts. And rightfully so. Her acting (like Pearces, or Pant's for that matter) holds up through multiple viewings. Even though you saw the same thing the first time around, the second time you see her in the movie, it is completely different.<br/><br/>The technical aspects shine as well. The screenplay is thorough and polished, with some pretty realistic dialog. The score by David Julyan is haunting and perfect for the movie. The warped editing by Dody Dorn is seamless and paced. And, of course, the direction by Christopher Nolan is wonderful.<br/><br/>Overall, an awesome and mind-bending thriller."

","It's a rare experience these days, to watch a movie and have the feeling, that you just are seeing something new, something that hasn't already been there. This was at least the feeling that Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" gave me and in this case it's not so much the story that is new (although it is pretty great and fresh nevertheless) but the way how it is told. The reverse chronological order makes it a challenging experience. This is really a film that gives you much substance for discussion, because you might not really understand all about it. Whether or not full understanding is possible at all is a question I haven't answered for myself. Did his wife actually die? Was it himself who killed her? Who can he really trust? Some of these and more questions I was able to answer after some time, some I can't figure out till right now. But I will for sure try it again. Thank you, Christopher Nolan!"

","Lenny was an insurance investigator. He worked a case with Sammy Jankis who was faking the memory loss condition and Lenny called his bluff. One night there were 2 men that broke into Lenny's house and rapped his wife. Lenny got one of them but the 2nd hit him from behind which is when he develop his condition. His wife was not killed. After he lost his short term memory, he was admitted to a mental hospital but was stable with possible mental problems so he went back to his wife. He would give his wife insulin shots once a day at a certain time. His wife wasn't sure if he was faking the condition of if it was legit so he decides to test her. He eds up giving her to much insulin and she dies. He has cant believe that he killed his own wife so he conditioned himself to believe that Sammy was the one that had the wife and killed her with insulin. He went back to the mental hospital but broke out. While he was there, he either found or made up the John G character that raped and killed his wife. From that point on, Lenny believed his wife was murdered the night she was raped. Lenny found the guy that raped, not killed, his wife and murdered him, which is the pic where he is bloody and smiling, but after he got his revenge, he forgot. Teddy, the cop that was assigned to Lenny's case, helped Lenny find the first JohnG. After they got the first guy, Teddy gave Lenny the police report from the night his wife was rapped but in order to keep his new story sensible, Lenny took out pages and inked out certain parts that proved him wrong. Lenny went through the process again with help from Teddy on the phone which led him to Jimmy G, Natalie's boyfriend. Teddy wanted to make some money off Jimmy so he set Lenny up to kill Jimmy. But Lenny took Jimmy's clothes. Lenny knew he got his John G, so he needed a new person to track. He remembers that Teddy's name is John Edward Gammel cause Tedd told him b4 he forgot. After Lenny does forget what happened, he finds fact note cards in his pocket and goes to get them tattooed. He also finds Natalie's note in the pocket to Jimmy to meet At the bar so Lenny goes and meets her at the bar. After she found out who Lenny was, the guy with a memory problem that was hanging out with a cop that was gonna bust Jimmy, she used him to her advantage. She was gonna get in trouble cause she didn't have drugs or drug money t give to her and Jimmy's boss, who's name is Dodd. She used Lenny to kill Dodd with that whole scene where she pisses him off so he hits her. Dodd finds Lenny in Jimmy's car and he gets in. Lenny runs, but forgets why. He finds Dodd's information and knows he has to kill him so he goes to his hotel and waits, but he forgets what he was doing and thinks it is his room. Dodd comes homs and Lenny beats his ass and calls the only person he has a phone number, Teddy. Teddy and Lenny kick Kimmy out to town. Since Lenny helped Natalie, she helps him. He gives her the information he wrote down about Teddy the day he killed Jimmy and she gets all of Teddy;s real info, name which is John G and license plate match up so he decides he is going to get his revenge (which to him, he still hasn't found his guy, this will still be the first one). Lenny goes and kills Teddy. That is th first scene of the film so anything after that is inconclusive. Im pretty sure i got most of this right, please comment and let me know what you think."

","We used this movie in my college writing seminar class. It is amazing and worth watching over and over. I notice new things each time. I watched the movie after discussing Hiroshima Mon Amour and the novel ""Beloved"" in extreme depth. Putting it in the context of trauma and impossible mourning really gave me an entirely new perspective on the movie, which I had previously only watched for entertainment. I thought a lot about how he's defined by his trauma and why he must perpetuate it, and why it doesn't matter who is who. Also, it made me wonder why most of the color scenes are told in reverse order (like, 5,4,3,2,1) but the last two are sequential (5,4,3,1,2). Hm. It's definitely an excellent movie. The screenplay is worth looking at, too. My copy, at least, gives the Nolan brothers' stories of how Memento came to be, and it's funny how different they are. I guess that's the basis of the movie, in a lot of different ways..."
"FlaviusAetius","10","0","2","12 November 2006"," One of the best movies of 2000, and certainly one of the most creative
","Leonard Shelby's wife is raped and murdered on night, but not before he suffers a devastating head injury. Unable to form new memories, he must find his wife's killer, relying on notes jotted down on Polaroid pictures and tattoos scrawled across his body as a source of memory.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the best neo-noir movies ever made, complicated but not too confusing, and boasts an innovative premise: it starts from the end, and works back to the beginning. There are two story lines: the main one is in color and progresses backwards, and another one in black and white that moves forward. The black and white thread ends where the color one begins. This devilishly twisted approach creates an intriguing setup and works magnificently through the movie. Clues pop up in both story lines and questions are asked, themes interspersing the movie that all culminate with a stunning twist ending that will have you questioning your surroundings for a while afterwards.<br/><br/>Fine acting keeps the movie grounded and totally believable. Guy Pearce excels as Leonard, the former insurance investigator who's life is shattered. You understand his desperation to find his wife's killer, his frustration at his condition, and his paranoia that sifts through the film: is he being manipulated? Who does he trust? Joe Pantoliano does a great job portraying a shady character who may or may not be an ally to Leonard. And Carrie-Ann-Moss depicts an externally friendly woman whose aura of hospitality masks sinister intents.<br/><br/>Not to give it all away, but unlike M. Night. Shymalan's work, you can predict the ending. It just takes a good eye for clues and an ability to remember them despite the advances in the plot. I was shocked by the ending, but the second time I watched it I realized I could have pieced it together by myself.<br/><br/>One of Christopher Nolan's finest works, hands down. I just hope he keeps it up."

","Memento follows the life of Leonard Shelby, a man who was diagnosed with anterograde amnesia after the junkie who has just raped and murdered his wife hit him over the head with his gun. The main symptom of Leonard's condition is that he cannot create new memories since the incident. He can only remember seeing his wife getting killed and everything before it. This means he can never remember anyone he's met since the incident, what he's done, or even how long it's been since he lost his memory. Lenny is intent on finding and killing the man who raped and murdered his wife, and can only keep track of his progress by taking polaroids of the people he's met and jotting notes on them, tattooing notes all over his body, and so forth. As well as Lenny not knowing what he's done before each given scene, the audience is kept in the dark, too. This is done by showing each memory sequence in reverse order. That is, we start off by seeing the end first, then the next scene will lead up to how that end scene got started, etc. all the way to the start.<br/><br/>If you were to ask me what, in my opinion, is the most brilliantly crafted movie I've ever seen, I would instantly think Memento. Although it wasn't at all easy for me to follow the first time I saw it (the backwards sequences must be paid close attention in order to understand how everything fits together), it still captured me all the way through the film. I didn't fully appreciate it until I watched it through a second time, after which I decided this has to be one of the best movies of all time. The ending is just plain genius, and left me thinking on so many different levels for a long time afterwards. After seeing it a third, and then a fourth time, I was just plain mindblown at the genius of the writing of this movie. What I thought were flaws in the movie (which I accepted because no movie is perfect) turned out to make perfect, logical sense (look in the goofs section of this movie and see those labeled ""incorrectly regarded as goofs"").<br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen this one, put it at the top of your list, it's a must-see! it will leave you perplexed and I can almost guarantee you that you'll find yourself discussing it with the people around you and thinking deeply on many levels about the concepts this movie presents (if you're anything like me). This is truly a masterpiece."

","Christopher Nolan make a memorable movie. Unfortunately it's ruined by a too easy ending; the most important thing (and, certainly, the most difficult), I think, for a thriller story, is choosing a ""good"" guilty: solve a story like this one, it means not-choose at all, perhaps for fear of failing. In this way it really disappoints us, because it was a very well realized low cost story, with a great screenplay (taken from a book), some hilarious situation, and a surprising mechanism: it starts at the end and proceed on the contrary, jumping some time back to show us how it went at the initial situation, then it jumps more time back to explain how it went at the second situation, and so on, flashback after flashback. It's all in the same linear (but reverse) chronology so it's always easy to follow and understand. It's a story of a brilliant detective who works for an insurance company that one night find his wife raped and murdered, and it's hit himself by the mysterious John G. whom he swear revenge searching him, because the police don't believe at his version of the facts. Little detail: after the barrel he lost his brief memory, which means that he can remember all his life before the night of the murder, but after can remember everything only for fifteen minutes. So he forces himself to a methodical research of the murderer with lots of tattoos, notes and photos of his Polaroid, to remember himself all that he's discovering after that night, because every fifteen minutes his mind cleans every facts. But of course he must be careful, and ready, of that he writes on his notes. Besides, the others who know his problem, and tell that are helping him, could swindle himÂ… Guy Pearce plays well in a role half-way between Goofy (of Mickey Mouse) and Ed Exley (of LA Confidential)"

Little did we know that this movie would change the way we saw movies. Usually we discuss during movies because they usually aren't worth listening to, but in the first 20 minutes of watching Memento, we stopped it probably about ten times just to figure out what was going on. In watching this movie, we had done something that we had never done in the past, which was really study the movie backwards and forwards. We would find ourselves screaming, ""Did you see that, did you see that?!?"" Then we would rewind and watch it again. The movie's ""backwards"" style and complex plot is unique to any other thriller-mystery title in existence. The acting is a little dry-except for Joe Pantoliano, who was my favorite- but the action and marvelous storyline makes up for it. This is by far Christopher Nolan's best picture (although ""The Prestige"" looks pretty amazing right now).

Those who feel that this movie has any sort of plot holes simply haven't thought about it enough or weren't paying attention enough. This movie will demand your attention. Do not see this movie with a friend who frequently talks during movies, or see this movie right before you go to bed. Watch this movie only when you can give 100% of your attention to it and after that, watch it again. Every supposed ""plothole"" you could have questions about is told to you, you just may have to connect the dots yourself. The editing in this film, shot backwards as many other reviews have stated, is brilliant. However, the storyline is equally masterful.

","8.6? Wow. Memento is without a doubt one of the most unique movies I have ever seen, and the acting along with the screen play is great. Guy Pierce is a terrific actor and this is the first film I have seen him in. I've heard a lot about Memento and one of my girlfriends told me to rent this movie without even thinking about it. This truly was a good film. I will never doubt it of that. It keeps you thinking and on your toes of who's good and who is bad.<br/><br/>Because Guy's character, Leonard, has short term memory, he is constantly writing down notes about who to trust and not trust. He is on a mission to find the man who raped and murdered his wife and kill him. All over his body he had tattoo's that would remind him of what to do next. He has Polaroids of people to remind them of who they are, he explains his ""condition"" several times. Causing people either to be kind or take advantage of that.<br/><br/>It's the film that keeps you guessing and is a great new type of film noir.

","It's actually quite rare to see a full-blown character drama in this day and age, but that's exactly what ""Memento"", the 2001 film by Christopher Nolan, really is. I actually didn't want to write a review on this film for quite some time, because it was hard to grasp all the layers of the film, and believe me, there are many. Needless to say, though, this is one of my all-time favorite films, and it is truly a novel experience in film-making.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the film, the plot goes like this: Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pierce) is an amnesiac. Ever since an intruder broke into his home and murdered his wife (played by Jorja Fox), knocking him unconscious in the process (or so he would like to believe), Leonard is cursed with a fragmented and quickly-disappearing memory. He can remember everything that happened prior to the event, but everything that happens afterwards quickly fades away, unless Leonard writes a note about it. Throughout the course of the film, Leonard interacts with a variety of individuals in the search for the man who killed his wife, and in addition, an extraneous plot (from the audience's perspective for most of the film, anyway) occurs with Leonard remembering flashbacks about an insurance salesman named Sammy Jenkins.<br/><br/>It's hard to understand the film, especially since it progresses in a non-linear fashion. The movie runs ""backwards"", in that it shows a scene, then the scene prior to that one, then the scene prior to that one, and so on. It is difficult for the audience to understand what is going on, but it's possible that we are feeling the same way as Leonard: confused and disoriented. Even by the end of the film, some things still don't make sense, requiring multiple viewing to understand the motivations of all the characters and how they relate to Leonard.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't think Christopher Nolan could have picked a better cast of actors. Guy Pearce does an incredible job of portraying a helpless and confused man who is never quite sure of what's going on, but by the end of the film, the audience realizes just how out of it Leonard really is. I also thought Carrie-Anne Moss did a great job as Natalie, Leonard's lover with suspicious motives, and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy, a cop who is playing Leonard to his advantage.<br/><br/>It's a testament to this film that it works as well playing in a forward pattern (as seen on the Special Edition DVD) as it does when shown in non-chronological order, because it still manages to surprise the audience, and also shows how the other characters in the film manipulate Leonard for their own means.<br/><br/>The audience is right there along with Leonard as he struggles to figure out what the tattoos on his body mean, who his friends are, and how he can solve the mystery of his wife's killer. The only trick is that the ""B-plot"" of Sammy Jenkins, and Jenkins' wife forcing Sammy to do a test on her, is the real cause of Leonard's condition, and is subtly hinted at throughout the film. This puts Leonard in a new light and forces the audience to re-evaluate their opinion of him.<br/><br/>The directing and action are second to none. I think that Christopher Nolan realized that to tell a good story, you need a good plot, good interaction between the characters, and that you need to keep the audience guessing, something that is sadly lacking in many films nowadays.<br/><br/>It is true that if Leonard has a memory condition that causes him to forget things, he wouldn't be able to know that he has a problem, but I didn't notice that until the third time I viewed this film, and by that time it was just a minor distraction. Unless you have hours to try and dissect this film looking for anything that isn't true to real life, there aren't any real plot holes or inconsistencies in the film.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies I've seen. It's hard to explain, but if you see it a couple times, you will understand what the film is all about. Rent this when you have a chance."

Leonard was involved in a near fatal murder attempt on he and his wife and now is on a mission to find his would be assassin. Problem is having no short term memory makes things pretty difficult. Leonard overcomes this by tattooing his body with key pieces of information and keeping photographs of key people and places.<br/><br/>The movie plays backwards, so we see the ending and then learn the story backwards. Because we don't get this that often it makes it really tricky to follow, and at times so confusing you want to turn off. A movie buff friend of mine says ""I like movies where you don't have to think too much"", and in this movie you can't afford to vague out for 5 minutes.

","""Memento"" functions more as a work of art than anything else. It is something you will have to see more than once to catch all the nuances of plot and theme crammed into it. Herein lies a love story, a mystery, a drama and more packaged in a film noir wrapper. The story unfolds in little forward running segments that progress from end to beginning. Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is looking for revenge for his wife's rape and murder. He has a ""condition"", however, that makes it impossible for him to form new memories. He only remembers life up until the moment he saw his wife die. Interspersed with the sadness, even horror, of his situation are moments of dark humor. You can't go wrong seeing this movie, especially if you are a glutton for tricky plot lines. After you've seen it a couple of times, I suggest you get your hands on the reverse version of the movie."
"ANNIESCLAN-1","Null","0","3","22 April 2006"," Memento: An Expose, Not a Tantalization
","Structural and contextual conundrums are not very attractive to me, if only because they subtly seek dismissal. Despite the fastidious cleverness of their creation, those who develop these films and stories silently and self-destructively want their works to be decoded and subsequently discarded. Their influence is therefore transitory, since they singularly prioritize the initially impregnable and overwhelmingly meticulous content of their pieces. This is dangerous because, when something is enigmatic but in an inevitably understandable way, it means that its audience will not only decipher its puzzles, but think that those puzzles represented the only substantial elements of the film. Once they are recognized and understood, a collective dismissal takes place, and everything else which accompanied those cryptograms is also disregarded.<br/><br/>The primary developers of this film, author and screenwriter Jonathan Nolan and director Christopher Nolan, knew that this response was ineluctable, and therefore probably take responsibility for the potential transience of their movie. Or, at least, I personally hope that they would have been this responsible, since it would be unfortunate if they did not realize that the complementary beauties of the film, (e.g. Guy Pearce's acting, the clarity of its presentation, the sleekness of the black and white scenes and the historical depth of the characters), would all be neglected once the general enigma of the film was understood. Personally, I think that being a director like David Lynch would be much more individually profitable and endlessly rewarding, since Lynch is a director who provides no enigmas, and immediately informs us that there is nothing mathematical or puzzling about his film other than its incessantly apparent and omnipresent artistry. In this sense, one can always respect the originality of his form, while original content, like the kind which appears in Memento, is less devoted to its creator than to its audience. Lynch's magnificence lies in his uninhibited dedication to his intuition; it is something which he never departs from, which is why he annoys and frustrates a large number of audiences. When I claimed that he solipsistically refuses to part with himself, that also includes the departure from oneself which is an essential part of a director's empathy toward his audience. Lynch repudiates this departure and therefore only trusts himself, and yet this wonderful obduracy only allows us to trust in its endless exactitude and consistency, especially since it depends upon one director and therefore one vision, which is easier to preserve in an unchanging state than a variety of people who are all trying to wholly and consensually agree on the same principles. The Nolan brothers will not have this consistency because Memento is not about them. It is a film that could have been created by anybody. While these filmmakers are positively unusual in that they are interested in making a film selflessly isolated from their own lives, they must understand the unfortunate Machiavellian idea that such empathy goes unrewarded, and people will fail to recognize the anomalous sympathy that has been given them and will nonetheless discard the film after they have understood it. But, overall, as I solidified in the first sentence of this comment, the film asks for it. If it comprehended its own situation a bit more, it would have known that it should not just prioritize its own content, because, once that content is understood, the entire film will be disposed of. The creators also could have realized that, if they placed more importance upon elements that were timelessly important to themselves, the audience's dismissal would not matter because a few of the film's qualities would perpetually exist solely in their own minds. Nevertheless, they do not take advantage of these opportunities, and everything in the film is servile to the content rather than to their own independent vision. For instance, the black and white shots of the film have a refreshing beauty to them, (if only for their extreme contrast with the film's color scenes), but, because the movie is generally subservient to its clever structure and story, these aesthetical elements will be neglected and forgotten because the viewer will correctly know that they were secondary to the enigma of the movie.<br/><br/>This consideration is the result of just one form of viewer-response criticism that can be applied to Memento. Although I have elaborately and passionately written about the transience of the film's conundrums, they are illuminating in their initial complexity. Nonetheless, I could not help but respond to the film's self-destructive desire for an inevitable diminishment."

","It's not the ending that twists in this movie, but the outset itself is a feint within a feint within a feint - leading the viewer along the path to vengeance from the outset of the action - it's a unique vision, but the characters and director do it great justice. Christopher Nolan is just brilliant in the way he paces this movie, the scene transitions mean that the audience is up-to-date with the story as it goes, and the ending, the fascinating climax of what and why help drive this story into ""classic"" status.<br/><br/>I watched this movie recently on the advice of others, and I found that it was more than they had said it was - I'm very critical of most movies, and have found this to be right up in my top ten.<br/><br/>Accordingly, I'm giving it 10 out of 10.

"surfwithtom","10","0","2","2 April 2006"," No Loopholes at all
","I believe this movie is perhaps better well thought out than some are giving credit for. While reading comments, I have come across suggestions that there are loopholes in the script, yet I find none. Let me explain: Loophole #1 If Lenny only has memory up until ""the event"" and currently he can only hold things for a few minutes, why is it he knows he has a ""condition""? The only tattoo visible outside of Lennys clothing is ""Remember Sammy Jenkis"". And it's kind of inconspicuous. That's for a reason (this is possibly his first tattoo). He has placed it there to be the first thing he sees at any given time when he starts from blank. He remembers Sammy's condition and it explains his own situation. Loophole #2 How is Lenny able to explain his ""condition"" and how does he know he is on a mission for revenge? Lenny explains this himself while talking on the phone. He is organized and he has a system. The second tattoo Lenny always see's is backwards in the mirror, enough to get him going in the right direction. Also remember  Sammys condition was psychological.Sammy could not learn through repetition. Lennys condition was physicalLenny can learn through repetition. This explains why Lenny repeats his story exactly the same way every time. Teddy say's it bores him, and Bert says it's creepy. Notice how whenever Lenny gets stuck he always goes for his right-hand pocket to get his pictures? Repetition and instinct. Loophole #3 Why is it that Lenny does not remember that his wife was the diabetic? Lenny explains this in the diner. ""Memory is unreliable; it can change the color of a car."" The ""first"" photograph of Lenny looks pretty old and you get the idea he has been doing this for awhile. He asks himself the question ""How am I supposed to heal?"" by suppressing memories, of course. I think it is also important to notice the flash of Lenny/Sammy in the hospital, indicating that he is indeed confused on some ""memories""these are not ""facts"". Also  take a good look at the flashback of him lying in bed with his wife. He has already started the process of getting tattoos and developing his ""system""yet..the tattoos are different, indication that his memory is not perfect................. See you at the Beach!"

","This is modern day film-noir at its best. A ground breaking approach by director Christopher Nolan to convey such a run of the mill plot as a man avenging his wife's murder in such a way as to leave you physically and mentally drained but at the same time keeping you on the edge of your seat, and amazed at it's brilliance.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby gives his best performance to date, quashing his excellent performance in L.A.

Carrie-Anne moss is also superb as Natalie, and shows more depth than she did in the matrix trilogy.<br/><br/>You sometimes feel as the viewer, having a mild case of Anterograde Amnesia, or short term memory loss to you and me, as so much is going on you forget what just happened, and have literally no time to recover. If it takes you a few watches to get, don't worry its guaranteed to leave you enthralled when you finally do.<br/><br/>Arguably the best film of 2000, along with requiem for a dream, and undeniably worthy of a spot in IMDb's top 250.<br/><br/>9.5/10 - it loses half a mark, for working hard to keep up."
"view_and_review","8","0","2","2 March 2006"," ""Reverse Psychology""
","Memento breaks away from the normal crime/mystery movie by making the main character lacking in short term memory. I must say that I didn't know where the movie was going at first, but as the movie progressed I understood that it was taking the viewer back from the first event we saw to how we got there. The writers did an excellent job staying consistent with Leonard's (Guy Pearce) short term memory loss, and they did an even better job of not revealing to the audience any more than Leonard knew.<br/><br/>The best way to keep the audience in the dark about the course of events as much as the main character was to do the story in reverse with each significant event Leonard could remember. Although most movies/stories progress chronologically forward, this movie went backwards event by event in order to find out what lead Leonard to the point we found him at the very beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>As I stated before, the movie was done excellently. The only negative I would have to say is the lack of answers in the end. In the end I probably had more questions than I did in the beginning. I wasn't looking for a total resolution, but I guess I was looking for a little more than what was given."

","Memento definitely ranks top in my list of favorites. I have seen the movie many times and every time I see it, I realize it has a fascinating blend of all facets of movie making.<br/><br/>Generally when one talks about this movie, the focus is on the directorial misadventure or brilliance to run the movie backwards and forwards to converge somewhere but I have strongly felt that this is only one of the many beautiful things the crew of Memento have done to this great movie. I would like to discuss some other amazing feature ignored by many critics.<br/><br/>Memento is a story of a guy who has lost his power to retain and create new memories after an ""incident"". So basically, this movie revolves around this guy Lenny and his quest to exist in a world where his condition is almost an exception. But since one needs a reason to carry on the ventures of daily existence and since Lenny has no way of remembering these reasons, so he invents some extraordinary techniques to remember them - taking photographs and writing notes on his body. He tends to create opportunities and forget that he created them and that the reasons he has created are not a consequence of natural course of life. The movie not only brilliantly explores the agony and pain of a person suffering of such a condition but it also describes the journey of this person to fight all odds and still exist in a world without time but only matter.<br/><br/>The ""incident"", which happens to be the last memory of his, is compelling him to exist but only till he finds the man responsible for it and kills him. Lennys knows that after he has killed the man, he would loose the reason to live and so he practices the great gift given to him-the ability to forget.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has displayed that story telling is the most important part of movie making. He has successfully brought all the faces cinematic experience in one masterpiece.<br/><br/>If movies mean anything to you, you have to see this one."

","'Memento' is a story about a man who suffers from memory loss.

The story-telling and the story itself is amazing; it keeps unfolding like Russian dolls. The film is filled with complex characters, and it is easy to get disillusioned and out-of-focus, much like the main character. That said, it is done well and intentionally and it is an easy film to follow, and it has a complex storyline. I think that Memento was one of the best films of 2000.

","Have you ever woken up in a strange room, surrounded by unfamiliar things, and wondered where in the world you slept last night? More importantly, have you ever wondered what exactly you had done? Picture waking up every morning asking yourself these very questions. You know who you are and where you came from but cannot recall any recent details. With this I introduce the innovative film Momento, written and directed by Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce, exists in this constant state of confusion. A massive blow to the head, acquired while attempting to attack his wife's assailant, leaves Leonard with an unusual ailment: he is unable to process and create new memories. Relying solely on a few Polaroids, notes, and tattoos Leonard vows revenge on the villain who he knows only as John G. With virtually nothing to go on and unreliable evidence, he must trust his instincts and pray for the best.<br/><br/>Natalie (Carrie Ann Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) join Leonard in this mind boggling ""Who are you?"" mystery. We, the audience are ever watchful of their actions and constantly question their intentions towards Leonard. Natalie and Teddy poke at us, questioning what we really know. We are with Leonard every step of the way, needing to ensure his safety. The creative piecing of the story boasts this accomplishment.<br/><br/>Nolan throws us into the story at the end and we witness the events in reverse order, which results in the same confusion bestowed upon Leonard. Never knowing why a particular event takes place locks us in the dark, throws away the key, and keeps us on the tip top of our toes. The ingenious layout of the film's story line compliments the plot masterfully. Receiving snippets of information backwards and in twenty minute increments, the audience remains disillusioned for the length of the movie.<br/><br/>With only the Polaroids contained in Leonard's jacket pocket and the ink engraved on various body parts to reference, the audience inhabits Leonard's frame of mind. Overflowing with an abundance of dramatic surprises, revelations, and a handful of comic twists, Momento is anything but ordinary. Pearce captures our imagination and jump starts our psyche with a startlingly eye opening and convincing performance. Moss and Pantoliano reinforce the intense power and unpredictability of this film with elegance and ease. Capturing our attention and contorting it, Nolan proudly clutches our curiosity until the end, or should I say the beginning. This movie should be experienced at least once, if not again and again, but remember movie-goer etiquette and don't spoil the surprise."

","You think your memory is bad? Guy Pearce plays the lead in this movie about a man who is determined to find his wife's killer. Head trauma has left Pearce with the inability to make new memories so he is forced to record everything on paper or in the form of pictures. He keeps all of this information with him so he can refer back to it at a later time. He is sometimes taken advantage of because of his unique mental problem and he always finds himself in a very awkward predicament. He tattoos the most important information (those relating to his wife's killer) on his skin so there is no chance of ever losing it. This movie requires the viewer's full attention because the time-line bounces around a lot, the film goes back and forth from color to black & white. Really a great movie that will keep you glued to the set. The story is incredible and the actors do an impressive job of portraying each of the characters little quirks. This movie is pretty dark...somewhat similar to the movie ""Mullholland Drive"".

""Memento"" is one of those movies that require repeated viewings. Not just to understand the smaller points/facts that you may not have caught in the first viewing; but simply to experience this mind-blowing puzzle of a movie over and over again! It is highly addictive and it did leave me with a number of questions in my head (apart from the ending). The only way to answer these questions was to watch it again!

","There are a lot of excellent movies whose scripts rewrote the rules of cinematic storytelling (the Oscar-winning The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction are two good examples). Memento deserves a place among those films: it's the most complex, original, innovative, intriguing achievement I've seen in a while. Thought The Matrix was confusing? Think again. Memento looks like an ordinary film noir, having all the conventional elements (femme fatale, unreliable characters, ambiguous protagonist/narrator, bleak ending), until it fatally strikes you with its originality and audacity, making you unable to stop watching.<br/><br/>From the beginning you realize you're not watching the usual thriller: the reversed opening sequence is a fascinating narrative choice, and even more fascinating is the director's decision to tell the whole story backwards, with each separate scene ending where the previous one began. Thanks to this trick, the audience is as confused as the movie's main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a peculiar DIY detective who wants to find the bloke who raped and killed his wife (CSI's Jorja Fox). The problem? Because of an accident, ""Lenny"" has lost his short-term memory, so every new event is gone from his mind after 10 minutes. He has to go on with his life by taking notes, snapping Polaroids and putting tattoos all over his body. He also gets some valuable help from a cop, ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano), and a barmaid, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). But should he really trust them, given he can't almost even trust himself (""You don't even know who you are!"" ""I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco."" ""That's who you were! Not who you have become!"")? Writer/director Christopher Nolan knows how to build up the tension, as well as add emotion, with the touching parallel story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with the same disease as Leonard.<br/><br/>Both Pearce and Tobolowsky are superb as the two troubled men: the former makes you feel as uneasy as he does almost immediately, and he's got some really ace lines (""How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?""); the latter, on the other hand, is heartbreaking, his experiences make us wanna cry before the film's over. Pantoliano and Moss are very impressive too, their true intentions remaining unclear until the end.<br/><br/>For those uninitiated to Nolan's genius, Memento is the perfect way to start. For fans: watch it alongside Batman Begins and you'll experience an amazing day in your life."

","Does your memory play tricks on you? Leonard's problem is a little bigger. Struck on the head during the murder of his wife, Leonard can't (as he says) ""make new memories"" - that is, he has no short term memory after his injury. Through the use of notes and tattoos Leonard, a former insurance investigator, tries to solve his wife's murder. Problem is that his investigation restarts every 20 minutes or so, which can leave him subject to manipulation by others with their own agenda. And to make things even more interesting the movie is shown backwards from the most recent event to most remote. <br/><br/>Pearce and Pantoliano are both excellent in the leads. The problem with these trick movies typically (I'm excepting Pulp Fiction but including movies like Wild Things) is that the story-telling is somehow dishonest. Here that doesn't seem true, as much as possible they fairly accommodate the viewer within their considerable constraints. I have a different problem - I'm not willing to accept that perception is reality, and I'm not Leonard (who would have forgotten most of this movie by the end anyway), so when I've invested a couple hours I want to have some idea of what really happened (like, is Leonard's wife really dead?). That's my knock, but I give them credit for a fantastic execution of a unique concept."

","Amid a morass of conventional Hollywood blockbusters all clones of each other featuring inane predictable plots, wasteful special effects and below average acting it is refreshing to think that every so often a filmmaker has the balls to come up with something different and make it into a huge commercial success. Memento is one such film.<br/><br/>Essentially this is about revenge Leonard Shelby an insurance investigator is trying to discover who raped and murdered his wife. A hard task in the best of circumstances but Leonard has an extra problem. During the attack he suffered head injuries, which mean that he has lost all his short-term memory. He is unable to remember any details longer than a few hours. Places names, facts, times mean nothing to him a long time friend becomes a total stranger. Is the next person he meet and old friend or an old enemy? To cope with this he has devised a complicated system utilising tattoos, Polaroid and cryptic messages that tell him about what has occurred these have become his memento a physical representation of the memories he cannot retain. These messages are directed to himself and they are the only way he makes sense of the clues and information he unearths during the search for his wife's killer. He has to have complete trust in what he 'tells' himself, you would think this was self-evident but in the course of his investigation even trusting his own words becomes ever more traumatic for him.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film we see the revenge killing but this instead of resolving the story does nothing but bring to light a raft of questions, How did he get to find the person's identity, as the right person been killed. The story now begins to unfold retrospectively each layer revealing a little more of what events have brought him to the final killing. Each scene represent and distinct set of memories and rather like peeling an onion layer by layer the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Two other people are intimately involved in Leonard search fro his wife killer John 'teddy' apparently a friend and the mysterious Natalie maybe a friend or a lover? Both have their own agendas and Leonard has now way to know if he can trust them.<br/><br/>The genius of this film is the daring but successful attempt by the director Christopher Nolan to put the viewer in to the shoes of Leonard Shelby. When you watch the film you are constantly struggling to make sense of what is occurring each question that is answered only begs a new set of questions, it is disconcerting and it does challenge your ability to follow the action but this is as close as we can get to what the hero is actually experiencing. This method of telling the story is quite problematic as we are taken through each scene and a new piece of the puzzle is uncovered but there is a certain amount of overlap of events, which could prove to be repetitive. The director has wisely chosen to give us a slightly different view each time and thus retain our interest. Of course as the film develops we have an advantage over Leonard and gradually the truth begin to emerge in a much clearer fashion than it does for him, but there is still room for plenty of twists along the way and a nice sting in the tale.<br/><br/>If we get beyond the central premise of the hero's memory loss Memento is a traditional thriller and it works by the old fashion method of keeping the audience interested, mystified and excited in just the right measures. We have a central mystery to solve we have a list of suspects and plenty of red herrings. The brilliance of the idea was to subvert this form and introduce the unknown factor in the form of the memory loss, which manages to challenge every aspect of the detective form. At a more fundamental level it also makes us realise how much of ourselves, of our identity depends on our memory and on the connection and relationship we have to other people. Once this security of 'knowing' is taken away we become lost and completely at the mercy of others.<br/><br/>It is hard to fault the film all the performances are excellent. Guy Pearce his neighbour's days thankfully long behind him is outstanding as a man totally adrift, alone trying to cling on to the one purpose left in his life the desire to know who murdered his wife. Better still is the ever dependable and highly underrated Joe Patagliagno as the 'maybe' friend 'Teddy'. Just as Leonard is never sure how much he can trust him neither are we. Carrie-Ann Moss taking a break from kicking virtual ass in the Matrix series once again puts in a great performance, do we trust her, is she manipulating the situation to exact her own revenge?<br/><br/>The films great strength can also be considered it potential flaw. The confusion that is inevitable can make it difficult for some to follow, especially for those who are used to a film flowing over them in a passive way. Memento requires you to exercise your brain and even when it is all over certain questions will still remain and further viewing is essential.<br/><br/>Of course the central paradox of the film should not be forgotten, this is a revenge story but of course the character has now way of remembering the actual crime, his memory is gone and the memory of the act of revenge will also be a fleeting one.<br/><br/>So story and acting are outstanding but a mention also has to go to the cinematography and soundtrack that both helped greatly to create the oppressive mood that pervaded throughout he film and is essential to generate the sense of fragility that exists in Leonard's connection to the world."

","I have put *slight spoiler ahead* at a point, its not so much I have given a plot away, just said something that might get missed when watched.<br/><br/>This film is one of the few, if not the only one, to make me feel... almost, uneasy as I watched it, the way you are made to see, almost feel, everything thru the eyes of the main character (Leonard Shelby), and just how vulnerable you would be if in the same situation. I think it is unsurpassed in at least the last decade of movie making that I have seen (I don't watch a great many movies so I could be wrong here) if not longer.<br/><br/>I saw it on a satellite channel that shows the same film a few times over the course of a single evening and after watching it for the first time I started looking up the times for when it was going to start again, and half an hour later I was back feeling the same things all over again. Now I'm not a person who finds it easy to watch something over and over again (and almost never in the same night), but TBH I feel this film needs it, almost deserved it.<br/><br/>Throughout I kept thinking to myself what would it be like to be in that state of mind (short term memory loss, or more like, a total lack of), not knowing if you can trust what little you have remembered, or managed to pieced together every 10 minutes might be a better way of putting it, to make your way thru the day, with having the weight of all what this man has on his plate, wondering to himself if this could have been the person....<br/><br/>At one point *slight spoiler ahead* another of the other characters waits just out of sight for a short amount of time, after something had happened (that had been forced, just so as to allow the slate to be wiped clean, so to speak), causing the person to think that something 'totally' different had gone on and just by hiding all of the pens and pencils to hand can reinforce what they want to be the truth as seen in the head of the Leonard Shelby character, a very vulnerable and unlucky man ? ... or is he just a nut-case without a grip ?, there is room for an air of doubt to be left in my mind about how much of the underlying stories are about what people.<br/><br/>Even now as I think back I want to watch it over again because it could make some things clearer in my mind, or not, its not a feeling that I did not get it, its more a case of did I put things back together in the right order. Its not an overtly complex, just for the sake of obfuscation and no real ending or story type of film, it is quite complex the way things are seen and played back from the characters points of view.<br/><br/>Not a film to watch while talking with others."

Needless to say, you will be 'sentenced' to live with old memories and search for the 'facts' that would be the only stable things in your life. As a psychology student who is interested in cognition and this magic box of memory, I recommend the ones who haven't watched the film, to understand how hard it can be for a person to find the motivation of going on his life by recreating new facts in his new 'condition' ,as Nolan puts it to use.

There are some very legitimate twists and turns, ones that are not manipulated just for the sake of having a twist. This film is very smart about psychology.

","Memento is a movie 'exemplar'im its narration style. It just goes backwards....in accordance with what Godard has told about film making..'Film should have a beginning, a middle part and an end, but not necessarily in that order'.... Here the narration technique is quite innovative as it begins where the film should end. But that's the only thing innovative in the plot. So when you see it for the first time you are enchanted, but once you see it it loses all the charm. The story is all about one man's (Lenny) paranoia about his own self. He kills his own wife through overdose of insulin, then he creates his own world of characters and figures to justify his own deeds. The Samm jenkins character is his own creation to justify his wife's murder. So each and every move he does after his wife's death is completely created from his own whims and fancies. So all in all this movie deserves attention in the manner in which it is narrated. In the end you realise that oh! mate, deja vu ........."
"jaesboxer","10","0","2","4 October 2005"," One of the best thrillers of all time.
","I was one of very few mainstream viewers who saw Memento in the theatres. Later, when it was out on DVD, it became such a sleeper hit, spread by word of mouth, that practically everybody I knew had seen it. The words ""short-term memory"" loss became a key gimick in film and television. The concept of a movie, flowing out of sequence, generally unused since Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, now came back with a vengeance, forming such films as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Memento truly deserves to be called one of the greatest thrillers ever made. The concept of a man who cannot make new memories trying to locate his wife's murderer is a brilliant, but the impetus used by putting it in reverse is shattering. We experience the world of Leonard Shelby, whose short-term memory was destroyed in the same incident that saw the murder and rape of his wife, as he searches for the murderer, the mysterious John G. Tattooed with key information, Leonard is the centre of a drama involving three people: himself, Natalie, and Teddy. The story begins at the end, with LEonard finding Teddy to in fact be the John G. he has been searching for, and murdering him. Thus, Leonard is the romantic hero out for revenge. But as the story unfolds, new faces are revealed. The notes which he lives his life by, written on the backs of photographs, have their genesis one after the other, characterizing who he trusts and who he doesn't. A mark on Teddy's photo, reading ""Do not believe his lies,"" renders everything Teddy says, in Leonard's mind, false. Thus, for much of the film, we feel close to Leonard, sympathise with him, distrust Teddy, and see Natalie as the kind lover and helper. But as facts are revealed, these things begin to change. Natalie is revealed as a truly sinister character, using Leonard's condition to get rid of her enemies. Teddy's advice begins to sound practical, and true. Yet only in the final scene are we shown Leonard's real face: the bloodthirsty killer whose memory creates a vacuum into which all guilt and responsibility vanish, and who, never being able to fulfill his vengeance, and unable to heal by time, is driven by the soul purpose of destruction, by an enigma he created himself. In the final scene, we are left with a genuine feeling of unease. Why? Because we have attached ourselves to these characters as what they were revealed as at the beginning, we have sympathised with them, and never knowing where they came from, were content to assume by the present. But in the end, we find ourselves close to a psychotic, a murderer, a sociopath whose memory destroys all fulfillment and remorse, in other words, a mad man."

","This film gets the 10/10 rating in my book as although I am not 100% sure I understand it fully, it is possibly that little bit of remaining intrigue that makes me love it. Maybe it's because I'm middle-aged and slow of brain that I have to watch it twice before I work out what's really going on, and a third time just to be sure, and yet a fourth time to make sure I haven't missed anything the third time.

In my opinion, rather.<br/><br/>Lennie, in his own quest for revenge with his inability to make new memories, hard as he may try, is the perfect vehicle for anyone like Natalie smart enough to use for their own purposes. Everyone is using this guy, from Natalie to the hotel clerk; if he knows he doesn't care, well not for long anyway, most importantly he has to kill John G.<br/><br/>""Remember Sammy Jankis"". It appears that Teddy is the first person to take advantage of Lennie by using him to bump off an undesirable, but it's hard to tell from the film whether Teddy has persuaded him that his wife was murdered by junkies or if Lennie has persuaded himself of it because of an inability to accept the awful truth. Or maybe he doesn't remember the truth, maybe Sammy Jankis' story is that close to the truth.<br/><br/>I love it. I'm not sure if there's a philosophical point to the movie, but it's a very, very clever idea, beautifully acted by all. If you want some food for thought and a plot so convoluted it takes more than one viewing to unravel it to it's full extent, this is an excellent film."

","Leonard's wife has been murdered and he himself left with short-term memory loss. Now Leonard goes about life trying to catch the one who destroyed his life. He tattoos his body with clues as to who this man is and relies on pictures and his handwriting to help him remember certain things.<br/><br/>In Christopher Nolan's film, Memento, he brilliantly constructs a murder mystery that leaves the viewer in the dark as to what really happened. Nolan structures the film in such a way that makes us feel exactly like the lead character, Leonard. The film doesn't follow any normal structure, because it begins with the ending, then ends with the stories beginning. The viewer has no idea what has happened prior to what we are being shown, much like Leonard who has short-term memory loss.<br/><br/>Nolan uses black and white as transitional scenes between the structure of going backwards. These are breaks in the story line and act as a narration to give the viewer more insight into Leonard's condition. These scenes in black and white actually take place before the film and in the film's conclusion these scenes connect with the rest of the film. The viewer much like Leonard again must connect pieces of the story to come to a conclusion as to what has happened, but in the end the answer is ambiguous and we are told to make our own conclusion as to what happened.<br/><br/>Leonard will never remember himself killing John G. He will always go on trying to find his killer even though he has most likely already killed him. There are no ""good"" characters in this film, since everyone Leonard meets ends up using him for their benefit. Teddy uses him to kill a drug dealer, Natalie uses him to get vengeance on Teddy, and even the hotel receptionist fools Leonard by checking him into two separate rooms. The film takes more then one view to comprehend what happens and it takes a great filmmaker to be able to make people talk about something years later. Nolan has manages to become an auteur with Memento, not only being the vision behind it but the creator all together.<br/><br/>Joe Pantoliano, who has a knack for playing evil roles, sets himself apart here and really shines. Where Pearce is most of the times flat Pantoliano brings life and comedy into the film. His Matrix co-star Carrie Ann Moss also brings a certain charm here; in her own little evil way.<br/><br/>Everyone should watch this film at least once, trust me, you'll need more then one viewing to know what's going on. It's structure and presentation is astonishing and should be awarded so. I give thumbs up for Nolan's Memento."

","Momento is one of those rare films that has an original and interesting idea and manages to carry out it execution perfectly.

"jasonbourneagain","8","0","3","27 July 2005"," ***Spoilers!!!*** Memento Raises More Questions Than It Answers
","I liked this movie in that it starts off at the end and goes backward. The main character, Leonard Shelby, cannot form new memories and experiences because they are forgotten in a few minutes. Yet he wants revenge for the death of his wife and has gotten the message tattooed to his chest, so it becomes his prime directive whenever he wakes up or forgets what he's going to do.<br/><br/>The color scenes in this movie tell the story of Leonard in reverse chronological order. Interspersed within the film are black and white scenes which tell the story of Leonard, a man named Sammy Jankis, and present the mystery of who Lenny is talking to on the phone in chronological order.<br/><br/>This is done brilliantly by director Christopher Nolan and his crew in order to confuse and disorient his audience by only giving bits and pieces of the story until they can piece the whole story together. It's an engrossing story as we are put in the shoes of Leonard Shelby to empathize with his memory problem.<br/><br/>The movie has a smart premise and execution, but questions pop up that cannot be readily answered. There are plot holes and goofs in the movie, both deliberate (likely put in to show that Leonard's memory is faulty) and not, which tear down the movie somewhat for me. The story and Leonard Shelby's condition does not hold up under scrutiny.<br/><br/>The biggest plot hole is Leonard is able to remember that he has a short-term memory problem. Apparently, he has conditioned himself to look at his ""remember Sammy Jankis"" tattoo on his hand and this brings the long-term memory back of his condition. Jankis was a con man who tried to extort money from Leonard's insurance company with a short-term memory loss scam which Leonard exposed.<br/><br/>(EDIT: I'll concede this point. The movie does explain how Leonard is able to do this. It just wasn't obvious to me when I watched the movie the first time.)<br/><br/>Another problem I had was why didn't Teddy just break into the trunk of Leonard's car or trick Leonard, take the money and run? He had several opportunities to do it and is sitting inside the car when Leonard's not there in one scene. The car even has its window missing.<br/><br/>Next, there are minor goofs or mistakes in the story. Sharp eyed viewers have spotted this. Leonard says that he has no short-term memory and cannot remember anything after the accident to Burt. Yet he can remember his wife dying and the actual attack where he loses his memory. Also, he called him Burt in one scene and there was no way he could have known his name. There is fact 6. Leonard couldn't have known which fact number to put down for the license plate when he wrote it. These aren't as serious, but they can add up and spoil a movie.<br/><br/>Finally, the key message in this movie is memory is not always reliable and we are shown evidence of this -- the license plate having an 'I' and then it changes to a '1' and even the tattoo is wrong as it has a '1', the picture of Jimmy changing from clean shaved to mustache, the ""I've done it"" tattoo, etc. These could be mistakes, too, but I think they are deliberate in order to show Leonard's memory is not reliable.<br/><br/>To enjoy this movie, one has to accept the plot holes and goofs in the movie. I had to discuss this movie with friends after the first viewing and then watched it twice on DVD to get all the nuances.<br/><br/>The movie does succeed in explaining the complex story line. It's presented in an interesting manner with a bit more information told to us each time as the movie moves both backward and forward in time. Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano do an excellent job of convincing us of Leonard's condition and relationships and becoming sympathetic to it. It's the plot holes and actual goofs in the story which take it down for me.<br/><br/>(EDIT: The movie is a puzzle for the viewer to figure out as to what happened and why. Director Christopher Nolan explains that the answer is within the movie. His answer is 1) He's misdirecting us saying Leonard as having anterograde amnesia or And. He only THINKS he has it. In other words, it's a serious PSYCHOLOGICAL disorder. The guy has let his wanting revenge for his wife's death turn him into a sociopath and killer. He uses the And to fulfill this need. When he actually does complete his task, he makes up LIES in order to put his world back in order again. Thus, he continues to believe he has And and continues to hunt for his wife's killer. It's a puzzle that can never be solved. <br/><br/>After figuring out Nolan's answer or ""trick"" to this movie, I gave it a higher rating from 7.5 to 8.5. It makes for a more satisfactory experience. How sick is Lenny when he thinks his wife is dead, so he ends up killing his wife in real time because she keeps wanting insulin injections. His psychological disorder made him believe in his memory loss so much that he could not snap out of it. This allows him to continue getting revenge and killing as the riddle he has tattooed on himself can never be solved when he can conveniently forget it in his own mind. Still, the movie is left open-ended and the viewer is left to figure it out for themselves. There have been an alternative theory created to explain it. Perhaps the truth about Memento can be found in a line from the movie -- ""So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?"")"

The scenario in itself is quite simple and has a common theme (revenge). The way it's told makes the difference and it manages to make us experience life as it is lived by Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce).<br/><br/>Another great thing about this movie is the cast. Every actor, and I mean every actor does an excellent job with his part. If I would of expected that from Guy Pearce, the pleasant surprise came from Carrie-Ann Moss, but then again, probably The Matrix isn't quite the kind of movie to showcase an actors' talents.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is the best I've seen in the last 5 years by far and my personal favorite. If you haven't seen this movie you definitely should.<br/><br/>Small comment: I've seen a review that wondered how could Leonard remember he has his ""condition"".

","When this film first came out, I was blown away. It was the first film since ""L.A.

What a concept! The script had to be thought out really well because of the format of showing the end first and going backwards in segments. Also the use of using black and white for part of the story that moves forward and using color for the main part of the story which is told backwards.<br/><br/>There's great dialog in this film and despite the ""noir"" concept, it has quite a sense of humor. At one point Leonard defends his affliction by saying ""memory is unreliable."" Burt tells Leonard ""it's all backwards,"" which is speaking about the format of the film.<br/><br/>The cast is universally excellent. Guy Pierce does a west coast accent that had me fooled, and I have lived here all my life. Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano are better than they were in ""The Matrix."" <br/><br/>The ending is rather ambiguous. There is debate whether you should not believe Teddy because he lies or if he is telling the truth because he knows that Leonard will not remember anyway. There are some hints where we see a glimpse of Sammy in the mental hospital and then see Leonard in his place. We see a glimpse of Leonard giving his wife an insulin shot, but then he decides that she was not diabetic and he remembers that he was only pinching her. There is a shot of him laying next to his wife, covered in his tattoos full of clues. We don't what is really memory and what is imagination.

","Memento is one of those films that one struggles to keep up with because of its many sudden shifts in direction. However, if one can make it to the end of the film with even an inkling of understanding, consider yourself lucky. I first saw this film during its theatrical release, but when I viewed it this time, I still found myself trying desperately to piece together the story.<br/><br/>This film is about the main character Leonard?s search for the man who raped and killed his wife. His search has been made especially difficult due to the fact that he has a form of brain damage that inhibits him from creating new memories. (He remembers everything up to the point of his wife?s murder). Leonard is convinced that he can overcome his handicap if he relies on habit and routine. Throughout his investigation, he has collected certain clues and ?Facts,? which he has tattooed on his body. Leonard must place his faith in the notes he has written to himself over the course of his investigation. He has come to adhere to these notes without question because they are the only things he can really know for sure.<br/><br/>The film starts with the last scene and proceeds backward as we see how Leonard has arrived at his conclusions. This film questions what is and what is not real. Leonard is asked what kind of satisfaction he can possibly get from avenging his wife?s death. After all, he would not be able to remember it. Leonard?s response is that just because a person closes their eyes, it does not mean that the world disappears. He claims that he is not seeking vengeance for himself but for his wife.<br/><br/>Despite the unorthodox beginning and minor confusion as to what was really happening, I enjoyed this movie very much. Perhaps, I will watch it again in order to grasp an even better understanding of it."

","Very well crafted film. This first impression it made on me was how complex it was to write and edit without looking cheesy or inconsistent.Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" carefully threads a forward moving black and white narration of the reasons the storyline events unfold in the way and order which explains the color portion of the film which is showed in retrospect. (Does that make sense?)(Watch the movie and it will)<br/><br/>This complex film has a very simple premise, Guy Pierce's character ""Leonard"" is out to avenge his wife's killer. Thats it!.......But wait, this film is shown in a pseudo Jeopardy game format where the answer is given first and the questions are yet to unfold. The scenes are edited in a Terrentino style and Pulp Fictionesse kind of way, whereby you are given vignettes of events which at first don't make sense, until you see the plot unfold after the fact.The fact that Leonard cannot store any new information into his short term memory, gives way to how difficult everyday things are to remember for him, but also how dedicated he is to solve this murder mystery when you can't remember what he did ten minutes ago. This gives this movie an intriguing storyline. <br/><br/>The film starts at the end and slowly devolves into explaining what was shown in the very opening. The fading photograph is a great metaphor for how the rest of the film is going to devolve, and unfold the details after the fact. The only saving grace for Leonard is that he remembers  someone (Sammy Jenkins) that he once investigated who had the same mental condition that he has. Sammy Jenkins had provided the road map to the process Leonard needed in order to solve this mystery, as he moved through the storyline. The only saving grace from Leonard is that he learned first hand from Sammy Jenkins that, ""You got to have a system to make it work"". This is how Leonard is able to track and find his wife's killer  through the use of the process of writing everything down and photographing people and places. This process was learned prior to his wife's death and was still in his long term memory. Leonard kept permanent notes tattooed to his body in order to keep from losing them. When questioned about his method of keeping his information Leonard defends his system by saying, by writing down facts I remember, but memory can change a car to a van or the shape of a room. Leonard impresses upon the viewer that his process of orientation is the most efficient and only possible way he can put the pieces together to track down his villain. <br/><br/>The director uses a telephone conversation which moves in a forward direction (against the retro tide of the color portion of the devolving film) to explain the events that are showing in a retrospective play by play sequence of events. This telephone conversation is filled with all recalled information which is the only information that is store in his head. Leonard speaks on the telephone in a very lucid and fluid way, which never gave the impression that he had a memory disability at all. This black and white narration explains the process Leonard uses, as learned from Sammy Jenkins. Jenkins taught Leonard to ""learn not by memory, but by instinct"". It is Leonards past experiences in his long term memory and his instinct as an investigator is what takes him to his wife's killer.......Great movie, I need to see it again to test the truths of the movie, very much like the movie The Sixth Sense."
"RogishLvr","9","0","2","12 May 2005"," Memento Review
","Memento starts out in a very peculiar way. It starts out with Leonard shaking a Polaroid picture. The more he shakes the picture, the less developed the picture is. This one scene sets the mood for the movie. In the picture we see a bloodied corpse. Who is the corpse? Why is he dead? Why is Leonard holding a picture of the corpse? Why is the picture becoming undeveloped? All these questions come to mind right at the start. Already we are filled with questions. Also, this subtle un-developing of the Polaroid picture leads into the fact that the movie is being played from end to beginning through the different scenes. Each subsequent scene happens before the scene that the view just sees. The very first scene is even played in ""rewind"" to establish this fact. We see the picture go back into the camera, the blood flow back into the body, the empty cartridge go back into the gun. All these things establish this ""back to front"" feel of the film.<br/><br/>In the first ten minutes we find out what makes the film Memento really unique. The anti-hero of this film has this ""condition"" where he can't make new memories. He says he's had an ""injury"" that has impaired his memory. With this condition, he can't remember anything beyond his accident. He goes on to narrate about his condition and how he's learned to adapt to it. However, while he's narrating we watch him wake up and go through a routine by merely following notes he's left for himself. The filming during this is particularly interesting. It's shot all in black and white giving the viewer a much more vivid feeling of being lost. We're put in this generic motel room with no idea where it's taking place. With everything in black and white it just flows together making nothing stand out. All this increases this feeling of helplessness. We don't know where Leonard is or what is going on.<br/><br/>One of the peculiarities of this film is the ambiguity of the characters. In the first twenty minutes of the movie the viewer is introduced to the three main characters: Leonard, Teddy, and Natalie. However, the viewer does not know who is good or bad. Teddy seems cherry and helpful;, however, Leonard finds out that he is really named John Gammell. Leonard knows that John G. killed his wife. Natalie gives Leonard information on John Gammell and so seems helpful herself. The question is which side are these two characters are on.<br/><br/>One of the interesting techniques this film uses is how it shifts scenes. By showing us the scenes from end to beginning, the film makes the viewer feel as lost as Leonard. Each scene is started with Leonard not knowing where he is. With the film playing backwards, we also do not know where he is or what is going on. An example of this is the scene that starts in the bathroom. Leonard is holding a bottle of alcohol. He turns the bottle over and says, ""Hmm I don't feel drunk."" This shows exactly how he feels. He stops concentrating on what is going on and completely forgets what he is doing. He then has to figure out what situation he's in. With the scenes just starting and not knowing what has lead up to them, the viewer also has no idea what Leonard is doing a given situation. After the scene is played out, the scene in the timeline previous to that one is played. This way, we find out what the reason behind Leonard's placement in such a situation is.<br/><br/>This film also shows us how much we depend on our memory. Leonard has learned how to function to some extent by repetition and routine. However, he cannot heal. His wife is dead and, as he says, ""I can't remember to forget you."" Leonard functions only on a minimal level. He cannot pick up new skills and he can't heal old wounds. Everyday he wakes up and his wife's death is fresh in his mind. Also, he can't know who is good and who is bad. Every time he meets someone, it's like meeting them for the first time. This film forces us to acknowledge how much we really do rely on our memory.<br/><br/>The final thought Memento leaves us with is that we all lie to ourselves. In everyday life we lie to ourselves to make us happy. There are things we want to forget, and there are things we want to remember. Leonard forgot everything new because of his condition. However, he also forgot some things he should have remembered from before the incident because he wanted to. If he forgot certain things, he would always have a reason to live. We all strive for a reason to live, and sometimes we lie to ourselves to create that reason."

","I loved Pulp Fiction. I was one of the many who bought into this wave of non-linear storytelling, and believed that the structure as crafted by Quentin was the cat's meow.<br/><br/>And then I saw Memento.<br/><br/>And I saw it again.<br/><br/>And again.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan's gripping story of an amnesiac seeking revenge on the culprit who caused his condition and raped and murdered his wife takes the non-linear structure to a whole new level. Most importantly, the structure-- which is told chronologically backwards-- is not thrown in frivolously. Rather, it serves a definitive purpose and compliments the story being told: it allows us, the audience, to experience the vertigo, the unknown, that our protagonist experiences. We start with our hero's conclusion, and as the story unfolds, the issue becomes, how did our hero arrive at this conclusion.<br/><br/>Memento further works in taking advantage of a technique utilized so perfectly in Usual Suspects, and to a lesser degree in Fight Club--the unreliable narrator. In this respect, Nolan plays off of the long standing general principle that the narrator is trustworthy. Unlike Usual Suspects, however, where the protagonist turned out to be unreliable because he was outright lying, the unreliability of our hero in Memento is not (necessarily) that he was lying, but that his condition resulted in a distortion of his perception of what was true and what was false.<br/><br/>Therein rests the underlying theme of Memento. In a film where every character takes advantage of our hero's condition, he conditions himself to take advantage of his own condition."

","Memento is the type of movie you will watch once and immediately want to watch again. It is brilliant. I myself have watched it three times in the past two days: the first time, then I checked the official webpage (don't visit until after viewing) and comments here then watched it again, and then I watched it a third time, but this time backwards from scene to scene. It is suspenseful, funny, artistic,and keeps you guessing until the very end. Your ideas about the movie,the plot, and the characters will change many times while watching the film and the ending is nothing you expect. Even after it's over you still need to piece the movie together in your own mind to make some sense of it. <br/><br/>Basically, it's about a man Lenny who has a memory disorder where he has no short term memory. His goal throughout the movie is to find and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. He helps himself ""remember"" things by taking pictures of important people and places he encounters while searching for his wife's murderer. The movie is shown through two intertwined ""stories"". One is shot in black and white and is mostly of Lenny talking with someone on the telephone. The other is in color and these scenes are shown to us backwards... that is, starting with what happened most recently in the story line and ending with what happened and the ""beginning"" of the storyline. The purpose of this is to take us into the mind of Lenny, who can't remember more than small chunks of what he's been doing before he forgets again.<br/><br/>While it sounds confusing, it's not one of those movies that you sit through the whole time getting frustrated and thinking I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. It's more like you keep asking questions and picking up clues as the movie progresses, keeping your interest so that you can't wait until your next question is answered... like a fun mystery. I found myself smiling and laughing each time the scenes jumped to another place in time because it's all crafted so cleverly and seamlessly. If you watch the movie, which I highly recommend that you do, it will be clearer to you. It's definitely a fun movie that's also very stylistic and intelligent. There are so many layers to Memento, that you can watch it multiple times and have a different opinion each time you watch it.... about characters, the plot, motives, and what the director and writer are trying to say about memory, truth, psychology, ethics, love and revenge."

","'Memento'. Hmm. Where to begin. It's all backwards....This clever little film-gem stars Guy Pearce as Leonard, a man suffering from a brain disorder which prevents him from making new memories. He cannot remember anything after the murder of his wife, and he has tattooed his entire body with clues about the killer's identity. This guy, in my opinion, is a mess, sadly. Can he really trust his notes? Oh my, the paranoia. Anyways, I know that films of late are often credited as ""Hitchcockian"", but this one is the only one that really is. It's original, to say the least, in an array of unoriginality that plagues most films nowadays. Great emotions abound. Paranoia. Confusion. Fear of the outside world. Deception. The story, honestly, is really nothing new, other than the brain-disorder part of it. I've seen several of these murder-mystery thrillers....but the great thing about 'Memento' is that its director and writer(Christopher and Jonathan Nolan)dramatize this classic tale in an intriguing and unconventional way. Great stuff. Can't complain about originality...<br/><br/>Overall, I was definitely pleased with this title, although I have a feeling I haven't quite figured it out yet. That's the beauty of it, though. I'll keep trying, and I have some theories, but I won't address them here...<br/><br/>10/10 is my vote. An awesome experience."

","I watched memento just yesterday and it took me two times watching it to understand it...it's a good movie for sure: the first time you think it is just complicated, while the second time you realize it is devastating.we have this poor Leonard who can't assimilate new memories, so his present life depends on his notes, his pictures and his tattoos...OK, this is the general plot, but there's more. First of all we find ourselves trying to understand who is fooling who...is teddy the one? Is Natalie a deceiver? Who knows the truth...we depend on Leonard stuff as well, coz we see everything through his eyes, we perceive everything through his mind where everything is black or white. There's no grey. According to Lenny, Natalie is the good one, and Teddy is the bad one, and this is the same for us for great part of the movie. But in the end everything is upset, and we have to put together different pieces of the same puzzle...In the end nothing really matters who is the real jamesG or johnnyG, if he's been already killed or not. Leonard could have killed all these jGs thousand times...because this is what keeps him alive. Find and kill who raped and murdered his beloved wife is just the only Reason for him to go on living. Again and again. And the cruel fact is that he just see this, he cannot control anything else, so... Natalie becomes a deceiver, but Teddy too is a deceiver. What we come to know is that the deceptive one is always Lenny that is manipulated to solve other people's bad business. I enjoyed the movie very much, because I usually like movies that doesn't give you an explanation at first sight.I prefer movies that unveil things little by little, and memento is one of them. The choice of actors has been right. I found a great and many-sided Carrie-ann moss, and a good Guy Pearce as well playing the determined Leonard. What this movie leave you after the closing credits? I cannot say exactly. it probably leaves a pastiche of feelings and questions that should be, at least, cleared after a second vision of the movie. This is the reason why I advice memento, and why I advice to see it, at least, twice."

","I haven't read any of the other reviews, and this film merits more than I am going to write. Christopher Nolan has earned my highest respect, this film is utterly beautifully made, (not in the same way Hero is by the way!) <br/><br/>This is the best film I've ever seen, the characters, the story (the narrative!), the cinematography... everything is as cohesive and as perfect as I will ever hope for in a film. <br/><br/>The music, while not spectacular in it's own right, is still excellent and totally saturated with atmosphere.<br/><br/>Performance wise, this is for Guy Pearce, what Gladiator was for Russell Crowe. Pearce is excellent throughout, as is Carrie-Ann Moss, though her role is not something she hasn't done before, if anyone's seen Sabotage where she plays with Mark Dacascos. She is good at playing seemingly cold, but grounded characters and does it again to an excellent standard in this film.<br/><br/>I could go on for ages about this film, but maybe half the reason I liked it so much was because it didn't come along with any real hype here in the UK so I wasn't expecting much. I have never been so wrong in my life! And for once I'm glad for it! Roll on Batman! Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan with Gary Oldman and all the other actors involved!

","Throughout the whole movie you sit in suspense, but there is really nothing tangible to wrap any emotion around. And then it happens. At the closing of the movie, I was overcome with a feeling I struggle to understand, let alone verbally express. The best way that I can describe it is that every emotion a person normally feels throughout the course of a movie, which you don't in this movie, all come rushing back to you at once at the very end of the film. It was almost dizzying to me, but in a good way. The characters are complex and very much human. The acting is superb from the leading roles on down to the supporting actors.

","Generally the movie line of Memento is confusing. I had to watch this movie for my psychology class, and other than the fact of not being able to eat popcorn and relax ( for we were in a classroom ) the movie line put me a bit on edge. Being a type A personality, I was suffering through this movie trying to figure out what was going on. Then at the end when I finally figured it out, I was disappointed. I think this movie could have been made a bit more clear to those of us who don't connect so fast. As along those lines, some movies just aren't for the masses, I would have to say this isn't that type of film and could have been altered at the making. For those of you that have a general gift for being able to interpret seemingly meaningless clues I would suggest this movie. However to those of you that just want to relax, and possibly have an excuse to stare at a TV screen for several hours, this wouldn't be your best selection."

In your case Teddy, I will.' as well as: 'You're a John G. so you could be MY John G.'<br/><br/>I am just curious if he could be sort of a bad guy in a way.

","Memento, an independent thriller starring Guy Pearce, Carrie Ann-Moss, and Joe Palantino and directed by Christopher Nolan, has earned a lot of praise recently and is extremely high on the IMDB Top 250 list. This is not a real-life gritty movie, nor it is fantastical. It is not your average Film Noir type thriller, nor is it your average 'twist at the end' thriller. This is one of the most confusing movies ever made, and to say that it's not in chronological order would be putting it lightly. But, if you like movies with lots of twists and lots of psychological turns, then this is one of the best out there. It follows a man with short-term memory loss, played by Pearce. He reminds himself of who/what/where/when/why he is with photographs. But as his past and mission emerges, and the pieces fit more and more together, this movie just gets better and better. This is a very good movie, and as I said, if you like puzzles, you can't get much better than this. <br/><br/>My grade: 8/10"
"peteandsia","Null","0","2","23 May 2004"," The Multiple Personality Theory
","This review is for those of you who have seen the film and have caught the ""what's it really about"" bug. It contains major spoilers!!!<br/><br/>I don't want to think about how much time I have wasted watching and re-watching this film, analysing it frame-by-frame on DVD and surfing the net 'till the early hours trying to find a suitable meta-theory that tied up the movie and conveniently explained all those difficult questions it raises. Chris Nolan, the film's director has apparently said that there is a cogent, underlying truth that explains everything in the movie, I'm sorry to say I haven't found it yet. But I think I might have found an important clue... <br/><br/>In the course of my explorations I came across the short story: Memeto Mori by Nolan's brother Jonathan <br/><br/>In reading and re-reading this story one persistent and important question arises, who is the narrator? It seems clear that the narrator is in fact Earl (the protagonist , read Lenny). But oddly the narrator has a much clearer idea of what is really going on than Earl does. The narrator instructs and advises Earl. Note in particular these words: ""You know there's a lot of work to do. It may seem impossible, but I'm sure if we all do our part, we'll figure something out..."" I think that in the story, Earl doesn't have memory loss as such. What he is really suffering from is multiple personality disorder. This truth is even alluded to (pretty strongly) in the passage: ""People, even regular people, are never just any one person with one set of attributes ..."" The narrator is the master personality, but he can't remember everything because he can't remember anything that happened while the other personality (the one that thinks it is suffering from memory loss) is in control. Does that make sense? I hope so. <br/><br/>So I watched the movie again, thinking this theory might help explain all those unexplained things ... and it sort of does and sort of doesn't. There certainly are parts of the film where Lenny appears to be behaving in a pretty coherent way (when he and Teddy run Dodd out of town), when he gets the tattoos, the black and white sequences where he is talking on the phone to Teddy (at first), and several others, It looks as though some of the occasions when we see Lenny appear to forget (sitting on the toilet at Dodds room ... when Natalie comes back in after Lenny hit her etc.), he may in fact be adopting a different personality. It may be in fact that different personalities live in the 2 different hotel rooms. This theory explains why Leonard hates being called Lenny, because Lenny is one of the personalities, perhaps the one that actually killed his wife. Sammy Jenkis may also be one of the personalities, the subliminal substitution of Lenny for Sammy in the asylum scene seems to suggest this might be the case. I also wondered for a while whether Teddy is real, or if he is an imaginary friend .. another manifestation of Leonard's fractured personality, but there are scenes where Teddy interacts with other characters and this would seem to rule this theory out. <br/><br/>The multiple personality theory doesn't explain everything. I don't see how it explains the ""I've done it"" tattoo, but maybe someone can take this theory and develop it. You never know, it might just turn out to be the meta-theory that Chris Nolan says is out there waiting to be discovered."

","Memento is one of those movies you see every once in a great long while that challenges your mind to think and confuses you in every single way imaginable. The movie is about a man with short term memory loss trying to get revenge for his late wife by trying and catching the man who killed her. Sounds like an ordinary plot huh? Well not this time. Instead of being normal, Memento unravels backward(starting with the last scene and working it's way back to the first). The movie is so incredibly confusing, that it's so hard to take in everything at once. You can't understand the scene your watching until you see the next scene. It's great to see all the little connections that you make going along the way. Memento is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.

","-Possible spoilers-<br/><br/>I will admit to having seen Memento several times before, but every time I see this film (this time with my boyfriend, who hadn't seen it) I find yet another thing I didn't `catch' upon previous viewings.  Memento is about Leonard, a man on the hunt for the man who raped and murdered his wife, only he has a pretty big wrench thrown into the whole plan  he has no short-term memory because of injuries he sustained during the attack.  He may talk to someone and then two minutes later still be standing there, but have no idea who he's talking to anymore, so he employs the use of Polaroid pictures, body tattoos with clues, and many notes.  <br/><br/>The story is compelling in itself, but the way it is told is fantastically brilliant.  Instead of a regular linear story that has a start and a beginning, Memento is essentially told backwards.  While the obvious thought would be that knowing a film's conclusion five minutes into the film would be anti-climatic, the screenplay and film are so well done that this only makes the film more suspenseful and thought-provoking, and of course, puts the viewer in a similar mental situation as Leonard themselves.<br/><br/>There are absolutely not enough good things to say about this film  even the acting is top-notch.  Memento was Nolan's breakthrough film, and it really showcases his incredible talent.  Shortly after seeing Memento, I watched `Following' his debut film, and was not disappointed.  While I haven't yet seen `Insomnia' (which is on my short list to watch in the near future) I'm definitely looking forward to seeing his vision for the next Batman film because I think he is one of the very few filmmakers who could possibly compete with Burton's two installments.

","Memento wins the award among independent- and aspiring directors as the film ""pitch"" they most wished they'd come up with.  Memento is a little film that breaks a great deal of ground in the narrative art, and there is not a director around who doesn't envy the simplicity of the concept and the lean facility of its execution.  Okay, there are plenty of directors who will dispute this, but aren't they just envious?<br/><br/>Watching Memnto is also one of the most gut-wrenching experiences a viewer can undertake.  Imagine you're wearing virtual-reality goggles that only allow you to see a very narrow slice of the world.  Like looking through a three-foot-long tube, you can see what's right in front of you but nothing else.  Is there anyone else out there?  Friend, enemy?  The director decides exactly what you're allowed to see in a world that begins with a violent shooting.  As a viewer, you will spend the entire experience flinching like you were about to get cold-cocked, because you're not allowed to look over the shoulder of the protaganist.  You see only what he sees, and he suffers from short-term memory loss.  So you grapple along with him to get control of a violent situation.<br/><br/>As a work of art, the film stands alone.  It is not just a great narrative, it is a twisting, looping theme-park thrill ride, the mega-coaster, where most people rave about the experience and a few puke their guts out.  This is not a date-flick, unless you're the Marquis de Sade.

","Memento is one of the smartest films ever conceived, no question.<br/><br/>Its base story about a man's hunt for his wife's killer is certainly not original, but the way it is told here certainly is, and it uses an incredible plot device to make it work even better.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce is Lenny Shelby, a man suffering short term memory less - 'can't make new memories'. His wife was raped and murdered and all he has are fragmented clues about what happened and who's responsible.  His problem is that because his memory last about 2 minutes he repeatedly forgets who he just met, what he just did, where he's just been. Consequently he tattoos apparent facts to his body to remind him of the 'truth' and photographs everyone he engages with as a 'memento' of them and to enable him to identify them later.<br/><br/>This is only half the genius of this story, the other half is equally, if not more brilliant; the story is told in reverse. It starts at the end, and makes its way to the beginning, but it's because Shelby doesn't remember anything, and of course, we do, that makes the narrative flow superbly.<br/><br/>
The core idea is vengeance and trust - who is he after and who should he trust to help find them? <br/><br/>The editing in Memento is absolute genius, and somehow it all makes perfect sense and works succinctly. It is one of the most satisfying films to sit back and admire the structure of.<br/><br/>In terms of performances, Pearce, Pantoliano (Teddy) and Moss (Natalie) are decent if uninspiring. None of them are particularly personable but that's more down to the nature of the story than bad acting.

I had to watch it twice to really absorb it. It's amazing a film that complex has no holes. At least none that I can see. A must see!!!!<br/><br/>

","The first time I saw this movie it went straight into my top5 movies of all times. And there is a reason. The movie is exiting/funny in a way most movies are not. Another thing that is worth mentioning is the storyline. Memento begins with the end and ends with the beginning (you'll know what I mean when you see the movie). Guy Pearce was great in his role as Leonard, the man with short-term memory, and the other actors were also very convincing. I think this movie deserves it's place as number #18 at the Top 250 Movies of All Times list.<br/><br/>A must see !"

","When I saw Memento in the theater, it was my favorite film of that year. Having just viewed it on DVD, I can say that it still holds up, and will no doubt remain one of my favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>The way Memento unfolds is totally unique. This is definitely a film that is not afraid to challenge the viewer.  Due to his condition, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has no short-term memory and therefore has no clear idea of what has just recently happened to him.  He has to painstakingly piece things together in order to track down the man who raped and killed his wife.  While watching Memento, you have to literally become Leonard Shelby, and face the same confusion and struggle to make sense of the events that unfold around you.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano are tremendous, and the supporting cast is solid all around.  If you have not yet seen the film, by all means avoid any spoiler-laden reviews and experience it first-hand.  You will not be disappointed."

","Memento was recommended to me by a friend, and it caught me by surprise. It was definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The story line goes backwards and forwards at the same time.  It is incredibly directed so that it runs very smoothly.  It has some of the best plot twists I have ever seen in a movie.  I would love to see the story board for this movie.

A man suffering with short-term memory loss, seeks revenge for the murder of his wife.<br/><br/>Sounds like a recipe for a bad comedy. I thought it was going to be longest 2 hours of my life when i saw the cover of the dvd but i had nothing better to do.<br/><br/>SO whats so exciting about a guy that takes polaroids of his car and hotel while tattooing license plate numbers on his body? Its his condition. He cant make new memories. He remebers everything uptill the accident but after that its all in pictures and tattoos.<br/><br/>The movie cant be explained. You have to see it to comprehend it. You have to see it again to comprehend it. But you must accept one thing, the movie does not have a definite ending. the director never made it to prove anything, just to toy with our minds.<br/><br/>We believe whatever we want to believe. We forget whatever we want to forget. We remember whatever we want to remember. But no matter how hard he tries, he cant. So, in order to make life justifiable, he decides to go on his own terms. Using his condition to his advantage, (and to others advantage or so it seems), he tries bring meaning and purpose to his life. Something he wasnt able to do before the accident.<br/><br/>The movie is great not because it is in reverse, not because it has some fantastic direction, not because it has a sexy green jag, but because it makes one wonder if we are truly honest to ourselves.<br/><br/>watch this one CLOSELY.<br/><br/>

"Manthorpe","10","0","2","5 February 2004"," Perfection in film.
","Leonard Shelby suffers from a brain injury he received when he tried to stop a pair of burglars that had broken into his house and raped and killed his wife one fateful night. He cannot form new memories. He can remember everything clearly before the accident, but nothing afterwards. He must figure out a way to live his life with this condition and to catch the person or persons responsible. Can he do it, and if he does, how will he remember it?<br/><br/>First off, I would like to say that Memento is probably my favorite movie of all time as of yet, and not without reason. It's probably the movie with the most reply value that I can even imagine. Every time I watch it, I notice something new or come up with a new theory on things. The acting is as good as it gets and all the characters were cast perfectly. Guy Pearce is one of my favorite actors simply because of this movie and L.A. Confidential alone. Joe P. plays the perfect good cop/bad cop and Carrie Ann Moss is very convincing as the revenge riddled, manipulative woman.<br/><br/>
Everything about Memento is flawless. The script, acting, dialog, camera work, editing, direction, story.everything. <br/><br/>This is as good as it gets folks..to such a degree that I seriously almost feel sorry for the people who don't get this movie or understand it, as they're missing something so spectacular. Some people have even gone as far to say that the movie contains plot holes. I beg to differ and must presume that these such persons aren't too quick. There's a method to the madness. Of course the movie has holes in it which open up almost endless possibilities, but that is a reflection of the fact that Leonard did not have all the details either. His file for instance. We are left with fragments of ""memories"" just like Leonard, and are forced to actually think and try to figure it out with him. Some people don't like to think I guess, or are completely incapable. Maybe it would have been better for them if Lawrence Fishburne rambled on about all of the details for about 45 minutes with sunglasses on, all while pooching his lips out. The fact that we don't know all of the details and that the story's origin and ending do have infinite possibilities is one of the reasons that I love this film so much and is why it's so great. Brilliant, simply brilliant. Had it been done accidentally or out of tactlessness then I would think the exact opposite, but that is certainly not the case here.<br/><br/>Sometimes a `gimmick', like filming a movie to be watched out of chronological order, can be pretentious and unnecessary, as we see in movies like 21 Grams. However, Memento's story was meant to be told this way. It's another technique that adds to the audience's lack of knowledge about what has happened in the past, exactly like Leonard's. These techniques all contribute to getting the audience to care about Leonard, and it works. Although the film is viewed backwards, all of the scenes slightly overlap each other so it's easy to follow. The director has used two different types of scenes here as well. We have the color, reverse sequence scenes that show what Leonard has been through.and we have seemingly chronological black and white scenes in which we are given tidbits of information about Leonard and his condition as he talks to an anonymous person on the telephone. Truly masterful work. This movie will leave you thinking about it for a very long time. I still like to think about the possibilities...<br/><br/>Flawless. 10.5/10  people should be strapped in a chair and hooked to a plethysmograph and forced to watch it over and over and over.."

","Among blockbusters aimed at brainwashed teenagers (which are also cool when you wanna have some fun without using your brain too much), there are some movies that will actually set a new genre.

Memento is one of them, and it is brilliant.<br/><br/>The cast plays to the perfection (my award would go to Guy Pierce who plays the tormented Leonard Shelby masterfully !) And the director (Nolan who got famous afterwards) filmed this in a way that you feel as lost as the main character who suffers from short term memory loss.<br/><br/>The plot is thick and the end will keep wondering (I can forecast heated arguments if you watch with film).<br/><br/>Anyway it is  A UNIQUE movie.

","I thoroughly enjoyed ""Memento"" and I admit I had to see it a second time to sort it all out. However, the reverse timeline (end to beginning) was done much better in the 1983 film ""Betrayal"" (which I've yet to find on VHS) adapted from his stage play by Harold Pinter. Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley and Patricia Hodge offer amazing performances with fresh choices using the crisp, pause-filled dialogue, for which Pinter is known, to its best advantage.

","Once the hilarity wears off of seeing that bloke from Neighbours in an actual film on a big screen, wowee, Memento turns into a very cleverly structured and utterly rivetting film.  The replaying loop of events, gradually augmented, has been done before but relax, Groundhog Day this is not.  Quite how plausible the hero's predicament is is hard to say but the story is credible thanks to some very careful continuity and no doubt some equally artful cutting.  The acting is ok, secondary to the feel of the film really.  In some ways Memento reminds me of The Usual Suspects.  It might even stand comparison were it not for the absence of K Spacey.  Guy Pearce proves he can act, just about and director Nolan is definitely somebody to watch."

Add that with slick direction and a cool soundtrack and you got one of the best films of 2000, if not the decade.  Many people say this is nothing but a gimmick picture, which I don't think is right at all.

","SPOILER!!!! I remember when Memento came out in 2000. I knew there was a buzz but I never saw it. Then in November of 2003 I saw it on cable and I was hooked. I submit that no one can see this movie once and understand it. I've seen this movie five times and still don't claim to have it figured out. After extensive research here's what I do know. The movie is about Leonard, an insurance investigator, who is the victim of a home invasion. Leonard's wife is raped and severely beaten. It's debateable whether she is killed, severely injured and dies sooner or later. It's even debateable whether she dies from these injuries (as I believe) or from an insulin overdose administered by Leonard (by mistake due to his short-term memory loss from injuries he sustained during the break-in). To help the viewer see things from Leonard's perspective (he has anterograde amnesia (short-term memory loss caused by trauma to the head from his attack) of only being able to remember things for 10-15 min. How you interpret what Teddy (a corrupt cop and the investigator from the incident) says to Leonard in the final scene is how you figure out the movie. I recently read an article where Joey P. (the actor who played Teddy) said the director/screenwriter told him that everything he says in the final sceen is the truth. If that is true (and why wouldn't it be) I may need to view the movie five more times to sort out all of the issues. I normally get a movie after one viewing. But, the more you scratch the surface on this movie the more you get. The color part of the movie runs from last scene (literally backwards) to first sceen (middle of movie at end). The interspersed black and white sceens run first scene (of movie) to last sceen at end and then blend into the color scenes. The newest version of the DVD allows you to program the movie to see it in chronological order. This movie is a one of a kind that people will be discussing from now on!"

Though I think Guy Pierce could do much better with a proper direction.<br/><br/>As for the character study, it's very, very shallow. And totally unbelievable. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have to write down everything you have to remember on small pieces of paper? The guy should have his pockets FILLED UP with pieces of paper, and would NEVER be able to find the right one when he needs it. Seeing this guy finding the right photos and memos just when he needed them was SO contrived, SO artificial that it had me laughing. Loud.<br/><br/>Just count how many ""memos"" you already have in your pockets, in your diary, in your drawers... now imagine you loose the ability to remember things, and think about it for 2 seconds... Your house wouldn't be large enough to store the paper.

""Memento"" is just another anecdotal curiosity, that will rapidly disappear from the public's memory (unless everyone writes down ""Memento is a great movie"" on a small piece of paper and puts it his pocket for the years to come...).<br/><br/>Go watch Cronenberg's ""Spider"" or ""eXistenZ"", or Jonze's ""Being John Malkovitch"", if you want REAL imagination, originality and insight.

The director does an excellent job of stringing together a story backwards through time.<br/><br/>There are no great performances in this film; the acting is adequate.  I loved it in the end though, but probably for an unusual reason.<br/><br/>This film plays, in the end, on the viewer's own short-term memory.  Most people don't pay all that much attention to a movie.  We're all used to lots of action.  Our minds wrap around the big things in a film.  We've been conditioned to remember the sex, violence, explosions -- things that have big impacts on the consciousness.<br/><br/>This film has almost none of that at all, however.  The story is held together by little details.  If one can hold onto the memories of the details long enough, then one can also figure out the ""end"" of the story about halfway through the film.  If one cannot, then one has actually become Leonard, the lead actor... lost in disjointed time that moves in fits and starts, like constantly awakening from dreams.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie (and I did enjoy it a great deal) because it is the living embodiment of ""art imitates life.""  The audience is Leonard, the director is Teddy, and the film itself is, when all is said and done, a depiction of how most of us actually experience life, and certainly how we experience the film itself.<br/><br/>Ask yourself what you remember of the big, loud films that get the big box office every time -- The Matrix, X-Men, any of the Star Wars films.  What details do you remember?  Do you remember any of them?  Or do you remember those big, bright, loud moments... and string together your own narrative to bridge the gaps between them?"

The idea of working backwards through time works in this movie precisely because the protagonist suffers from a rare ""total"" short-term memory loss.

","People like to watch movies, for different reasons. To feel good, to release yourself into another world and take you on a ride, to make you cry, to learn things etc. Certain movies, give you a feeling after the movie that asks oneself, ""WHAT JUST HAPPENED???"".<br/><br/>Memento is the latter, and what a breath of fresh air this is. This movie is different, that shows you the ending first, then plays a scene before the last scene each step of the way. Plus in the mean time it plays a different set of scenes forward between the scenes going backwards. Though each scene played, uncovers the revelations of whats to come. Confused you should be.<br/><br/>You should really go into this movie without any knowledge of the film whatsoever...... As you should with any film as a matter of fact....<br/><br/>Anyway stop reading this and watch it if you haven't already. If so watch it again. The basic plot is that Lenny suffers from short term memory loss, due to an incident. The last thing that he can remember is the death of his wife, who was killed by someone. Even with his problem, he sets out to find her killer.<br/><br/>Now even from this basis, creates a great story to come, but the magnificent thing about this is, as mentioned before it plays backwards. Nolan directs this with such imagination and scope, that he seems a very promising future. Guy Pearce is immense in this, the only film I saw him in before this, was LA Confidential. Now I'm a fan of his. Supporting cast is also good, with Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Annie-Moss from the Matrix.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say anything more, but it will leave you puzzled at the end and so it should.<br/><br/>A+"

","A great deal of originality; very nice tempo, presented ALMOST backwards (I´d say in a tide way).  Leonard (Guy Pearce) is not able of developing new memories so he has to take polaroid pictures, write down notes and tattoos. He is looking for his wife´s killer and rapist.  If you watch the film remember one thing: Leonard is a killer too; do not sympathize with criminals.<br/><br/>Leonard wears an expensive suit and drives a Jaguar; he stays in a cheap motel.  In the search for his wife´s killer, he forgets the room number, loses the room key, forgets the motel attendant name, etc.  He is constantly explaining to others his condition.  Very funny, he never forgets where the Jaguar is parked; he never loses the car key chain, he can remember where Natalie lives.  There are a lot of directing pitfalls.<br/><br/>Why Memento is placed at 14th? Obviously many reviewers spoil it.  This innovative film is very good, but not a master piece: ***1/2 out of *****"

In regards to those that don't understand it- get your brains in gear- films shouldnt play dumb to the viewer-eg. american blockbusters- they should provoke thought and reaction. plus you shouldnt just watch it once, go back again, and if still confused get the dvd- it has a bonus feature that plays the film the right way round- though it isn't as good in my opinion."

"bkam","Null","0","3","12 July 2003"," I guess I'm hopping on the bandwagon...
","Mild spoilers follow; general comments on aspects, no revelations here.<br/><br/>Normally I have a tendency to take issue with the status quo and play devil's advocate.  Stupid?  Perhaps.  Amusing?  Most definitely.  Memento, however, overcomes my instinct by its nature as a piece of nearly flawless filmmaking.  Any mundane aspects of the plot are completely obscured by the incredible structure of the film, and indeed, the simplicity of the story (insofar as one can know the real story) is a perfect complement to the film's complex execution.  The incredible acting, particularly by Guy Pearce, also makes Leonard's shattered world a convincing if not a completely comfortable place to reside for a few hours.  While some of the lines are not perfectly executed, the script for the most part is brilliant.<br/><br/>To this, add masterful cinematography which emphasizes the way in which Leonard is forced to live: shots which imitate a jarring blow, a slip of memory, deja vu...  The protagonist's entire experience is mirrored excellently in each shot.<br/><br/>As for the mood, get ready for some realistic suspense.  Ever wake up and forget where you are, or even just wake up thinking you were facing the other way in bed?  Makes your heart race a little, doesn't it?  Now imagine your life in danger, searching for meaning in a broken reality, in which every second you are bombarded by new surroundings that rise up from a few minutes of hazy memory.  Suspense is the fear of the unknown, and in this film, nothing is known for certain.  Hence, it is one of the most suspenseful films I can remember.<br/><br/>The best part is this film's repeat performance value.  I am not one to easily sit through a movie (or even a song) twice unless I truly loved it, and even then I normally like to wait a while.  Having just seen the film for the third time, I can say that every time was more enjoyable than the previous.  As you are less confounded by the sheer unorthodoxy of the film, you begin to take in details which make the film not a shallow experiment in film making but a rich world behind a broken lens.  I guarantee that you will come to understand things better and to spot amazing clues as you watch the film additional times.  There are some images gone in a blink, or conversation easily overlooked. Your mind simply filters out some of the dialogue as meaningless since you have no stable references on a first viewing.  Having grasped the plot, you will now have the necessary understanding to enjoy together all the intricacies of the dialogue.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film.  It is an intelligent idea executed with true genius. [10/10]"

","This is a very good movie.  Very creative way to keep the viewer off balance and confused much like the main character Leonard.  Watching I could feel what I imaged Leonard was feeling at times.  Confused, but it would then start to come together little by little.<br/><br/>Acting was very good, although filming had a few goofs.  Overall it got the job done though.  Very clever to tip the viewer by using color and b/w as to which way the story was running (b/w = forward, color = backwards).  Story starts at the beginning (b/w) and runs to the middle, and in color running backwards toward the middle.  When the middle is reached the movie is over.<br/><br/>I was surprised to read negative reviews.  Maybe they should watch it again. 40%+ of the 54,000 that rated the movie gave it a 10 out of 10.  #13 of all time from that many people might suggest that a second look might be in order by the ones that didn't like it.<br/><br/>For a movie that took a little over a month to shoot and cost only $5m to make that blows most all the main stream much more costly movies out of the water is something worth noting by Hollywood.  Special effects, Hollywood top 10 actor list, and big production budgets are not needed to make a very good film and a lot of money considering the gross so far on the film.<br/><br/>Outstanding.  10/10"

","Now I am not the type of person who writes a glowing review about any old movie, because usually those that I like get enough acclaim and more that I don't get too much acclaim.  This is my exception to the rule.  This movie is about as good as film gets.  This is not your everyday run of the mill, same old, same old JLo film or something, this is an original, thoughtful, intelligent film.  Those that have read or heard that it is ""backward"" or ""confusing"" pay attention while I explain the unexplainable:  when the movie is in color, the plot is from the back and is progressing to the middle, thus the first five minutes of the film occur at the end of the sequence of events.  Then the next five minutes are in black and white and are the beginning of the story arc (there are additional flashbacks of Leonard's memories, but those are fairly easy to follow).  Then it goes back to the next color scene which is the one chronologically in front of the opening scene, then another black and white which is the next scene from the beginning.  The film actually comes together with the final black and white scene becoming color and then there is the conclusion, but both parts are actually the middle: so scene 23, then 1, then 22, then 2, and so on.<br/><br/>Now to the actual merits of the film:  Guy Pearce carried ""LA Confidential"" on his shoulders (with the help of some fine actors) and has amazingly gotten bigger shoulders because this is his film.  Throughout the whole movie Pearce is front and center, the focal point.  Everything revolves around him and he gives a great performance, without overacting once.  The rest of the cast do a passable job.<br/><br/>Aside from Pearce's performance and the ""gimmick"", there is still an amazing script, cinematography, and director which I am going to lump together and label as ""The Nolan factor.""  Nolan's other recent effort ""Insomnia"" has received lukewarm reviews, but I like his work.  It is not style for the sake of style or to cover-up plot holes, it is style with substance and that is something few film-makers can achieve.<br/><br/>To tell you how engrossed I was with this film when I first saw it on cable (and I was sure I would hate it), I literally received a phone call about 30 minutes into the film that was from my mother and I was so into the film I realized she had been talking to me for a couple of minutes and was asking what was wrong, and all I could say was ""Can I call you back in like an hour, I am watching this movie?"" and as soon as she said ""Yes."" I hung up the phone, having not one time taken my eyes off of the television.<br/><br/>If you are up for it, it is an experience, but make sure you have a little over an hour and a half set aside and are ready to think... and you may think about unplugging the phone, so you can avoid a lecture about phone etiquette.  This film is one of my 10 favorite films and deserves a 10 out of 10."

Great technique used by Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>Along with ""Betrayal"", this is one of the films that goes back in time, but totally different stories, although I have to say that ""Memento"" sounds better, has better acting (sorry Ben Kingsley) and better direction.

His ""friends"" were Teddy and Natalie. After the murder they started to realize, that he lost his memory and they started to use him as a killer, they just had to give him some hints and he thought he is after the murderer of his wife (maybe the first time it happened was on the picture he burns?). Then Natalie somehow got the money and wanted Dodd and Teddy to be killed, so she made up all the things to bring Lenny to kill them both.<br/><br/>Well, thats not very fascinating (as the movie is); the fascinating on it is Lenny. His life is just one thing, he tries to find the murderer of his wife, so he follows the clues. How often did it he already? I think 2 times (the picture I mentioned and Teddy), but after a while he will somehow start a new hunt for the murderer and he will find new clues!<br/><br/>I think this would explane from where the ""Never answer the Phone"" could come (this was a very important part of the whole movie to me), or the huge ""Teddy G rapped my wife"" (or somehow like this).

","Picture the scene. You wake up with no memory of where you are, what you have done last or who you can trust. The last memory you have is of your wife being raped and stabbed by a mysterious man. This is the interesting premise for Memento, the first truly great film of the 21st century.<br/><br/>The film opens with Lenny, holding a Polaroid of a dead man- the person Lenny has just shot for the murder of his wife. The film works backwards from this point giving the audience the discovery of finding out how he got to that conclusion. This unusual narrative device both emulates Lenny's sense of confusion and challenges the audience simultaneously. While the audience is thinking, director Christopher Nolan throws complex ideas at the audience about death, memory and unfailing commitment, which both reflect and contrast with the main character's experiences. By the time the viewer reaches the `beginning' of Lenny's tale we feel mentally drained. Nolan exploits this by throwing up one of the darkest twists in recent memory.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce is revelatory as Leonard and instantly exudes an air of charm, desperation and menace to the character. Excellent support comes from Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss shocks you to the core as the enigmatic Natalie- easily her best performance on screen to date. The acting is combined with the simple but haunting soundtrack to create a sense of real depth and emotion thrillers rarely provoke.<br/><br/>A shocking tale of love, murder and memory loss Memento becomes a classic due to its stunning performances, soundtrack and direction.

This is a movie, that, much like Fight Club, is a movie that you have to watch at least 2 or 3 times before you can fully understand and appreciate it, but even then, this is by no means a bad thing. Memento is a movie that I find myself watching over and over, and it still isn't at all boring.<br/><br/>Putting it simply, without spoiling anything, Memento's a movie that you have to see, and with it's extremely intricate storyline, will probably make a lot more sense the second time round. In fact, possibly the ONLY problem I can find with Memento is that the first time you watch it, it takes a little while for you to work out just what the hell's going on.

The ones in color are backward in time, the ones in black and white start from the past and move forward. In the end the two parts of the story join, giving a complete picture.

The main character is Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce. His wife was murdered, and the murderer gave Leonard a right good smack too. The result was that Leonard since then can not form new memories. He sets out to find his wife's killer. Not being able to form memories makes this quite difficult. As such he tattoos clues on his body, takes polaroids and writes lots of notes.<br/><br/>The movie is shown backwards. So you see a scene, then you see the scene that led up to that. Strange at first. But I feel it is what makes the movie so good, as you end up in the dark as much as Leonard does.<br/><br/>I think it is a must see film for anyone who likes compelling thrilling films with lots of twists.

"gbheron","9","0","2","26 May 2003"," Whoa!
","""Memento"" is one of the more innovatively crafted movies I've seen. For starters, the story is told in reverse, the final scene of the story shown first, each scene following in reverse order. Therefore while the opening credits unfurl, you know the end result of the story. The remainder of the movie is the 'why' it occurred. This is intriguing in that previously viewed scenes become clearer and more understandable as earlier events are shown. The viewer's point of reference is constantly ping-ponging between the current scene and those he's viewed earlier. <br/><br/>And the plot is also very odd. It's basically a revenge story for a savage crime in which the protagonist is injured and suffers a rare form of amnesia. He can remember everything up to the crime, and from that point on, can only remember events that have occurred in the immediate 15 minutes, i.e., he has no long term memory. This makes day-to-day activities very tough, and his solutions for dealing with his infirmary are memorable.<br/><br/>If this isn't enough, ""Memento"" is a puzzle-movie in the sprit of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Fight Club"". After all is said and done, the final scenes (actually earliest scenes) obviate most of the assumptions you've collected. Everything is tossed on its head. I had to visit a ""Memento"" web site where the movie is pieced together for the confused viewer. ""Memento"" is a unique movie, a definite one-of-a-kind, and is highly recommended."

After Leonard hit Natalie and tried to record it, he kept telling himself, ""focus, focus"" as if the human will can somehow overcome the physical reality that coldly dictate who we are.<br/><br/>Yet the movie didn't spiral down the drain of self-pity or fatalistism. It balanced out the dark reality by euphemizing what humans do when facing insurmountable reality: self-deceit. Just as one marvels at Leonard's fanatic and spartan life of holding on to truth and reality, the mysterious picture of a happy Leonard and the unverifiable ""confessions"" by Teddy before his execution, left open the possibility that Leonard lived in a reality consisted not only the notes and tattoos but also how he liked to believe."

","This movie is exactly like a puzzle. It is narrated section by section, but the time order of the sections are reversed, so you know the last thing first, and the first thing last. You keep wondering what the hell has happened. Technically it is great. It is like an experiment. In the beginning there is a section shown reversed, you may ask what if the whole movie shown reversed, then the movie answers the question itself.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce (LA Confidential) played a guy who has no short-term memory (forget things after several minutes). Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity of The Matrix) played a bitch. Both give very strong performance.<br/><br/>
The movie has some philosophical implications about human nature. It has some common points with Dark City, The Usual Suspects, Rosamon, Waking Life, eXistenZ, The Matrix and Vanilla Sky, which all blend reality with non-reality and are all concerned with the question ""what is real"" or ""what makes a person a person"".<br/><br/>Without memory we are not the person we were.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce sets up objects for himself, otherwise he loses meaning of life. How about others?<br/><br/>The movie also described a world that is ""so damn mean"". It is multi-layered."
"griffin84","Null","0","2","14 May 2003"," One slight problem...
","I really liked this movie, but I feel really compelled to point something out.  We discussed anterograde amnesia (the condition that doesn't allow a brain to produce short-term memory) in my Psychology class in college, and if the main character really had this condition, he wouldn't remember. Seriously, a person with anterograde amnesia doesn't have the memory to even remember their condition.  We read about a man who had this condition, and to study his behavior, researchers gave him a diary with a note on the cover that said, ""Write in me when you get up.""  Every morning, when the man woke up, he wrote in the diary that it was the first morning after his operation. If Leonard really had anterograde amnesia, he wouldn't even have the memory to remember what the heck is wrong with him.  <br/><br/>Yeah, I liked the movie, but this is something that I just can't forget."
"learnnew","10","0","2","11 May 2003"," One of the best movies I've ever watched ...
","An amazing movie! Much has been said about the movie, the screenplay, direction and performances. I'm not going to add much here. I'm amazed that Joe Pantoliano didn't get nominated for an acting award for this movie! He gave by far the best performance in the movie. Stephen Tobolowsky and Guy Pearce were also amazing. And I'm also amazed that Nolan didn't get nominated for the best director in many major awards, including Academy awards and the Golden globes. What a direction! Hats off!<br/><br/>
I give it a hearty 10/10!<br/><br/>Onto the movie ... There can be many interpretations of the ""ending"" and the entire movie itself.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!! VIRTUALLY ENTIRE PLOT GIVEN AWAY!!! BEWARE!!! BEWARE!!! STRONG RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE!!! PLEASE WATCH THE MOVIE AT LEAST ONCE! (You've been warned enough!)<br/><br/>I found this interesting question on a few reviews, including Ebert's. (I personally think Ebert missed a number of points in this movie, very rare for him to do so.) The question is this: if the last thing the main character remembers is his wife dying, then how does he remember that he has short-term memory loss? <br/><br/>I kept thinking about it quite a bit. When I recently watched the movie again, it clicked to me. Remember he is always looking at the back of his left palm (at a very prominently visible place) where he has tattooed ""Remember Sammy Jankis""? It is to remind him of his condition. It makes sense because he always associates his condition with that of Sammy Jankis. This is my take on it.<br/><br/>There was also another comment in Ebert's review: Nolan's device of telling his story backward, or sort of backward, is simply that--a device.<br/><br/>
I disagree, because, what I got out of the movie was this: It doesn't matter whether the cop-character Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) or Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) are nice people or not. It doesn't even matter whether Leonard even found the murderer or not. What the movie is really about is the helplessness of Leonard. Granted, he writes copious notes, tatoos stuff on his body and painstakingly lives as much an ordered life as possible given his condition. But ultimately, he is human. In the ""climax"", when he says to himself that yes, he is going to play a game and make Teddy his target, it so amazingly brings out the helplessness of the character. It would be even more ironical if what Teddy said (as to Leonard being the real ""murderer"" of his wife, i.e., the story he attributes to Sammy Jankis,(did leonard succeed in making a long-term memory by training, after all?)) is true. The entire life of Lenoard is now being played in his mind as some ""normal"" life of revenge but he really has a psychological condition. And since we see the movie in Leonard's point of view, we are inclined to believe his thoughts and notes. Only in the ""end"" is his ""condition"" revealed to us. Therefore the movie had to be told backward. If we knew of his helplessness beforehand, I wonder what is left of the movie!<br/><br/>A personal message that I got from the movie: We always live under the illusion that we are in control of our lives, at least we want to live so. Is it possible? How do our helplessness and weaknesses and subjectivities manipulate us?"
"dsalyer666","8","0","2","3 May 2003"," Very good movie, but be ready for it.
","My summary may seem a bit cryptic, but so is this movie. The film style is innovative, albeit a derivative of the completely original plot. The narrative style is sincere in the attempt to portray a man who is searching for a murderer while suffering from an inability to form lasting memories. Be warned, however, this movie is not the bland intellectual stimulation, on par with end stage syphilis, that Hollywood is fond of creating these days. This film takes a bit of active thought. I saw it on a flight to London and must admit I switched to the music video selections after a few drinks. The more sober mind, however, found the movie to be both entertaining and thought provoking."

"CCS-CRITIC","8","0","2","16 April 2003"," Excellent brain teaser
","8/10<br/><br/>This movie is very clever and very original. Memento is a story of a man who loses his wife in a rape attack inside their home, pledging that he will track down a murderer for revenge and peace of mind. The main problem is that Lenny (Guy Peirce), after the attack, was left with a problem in that he cannot retain any long term memories. Well that's one brief summary of how to look at it, but there are others. Indeed this film is excellent and played with my emotions, emotions of sympathy, anger and questioning my own morals and judgements. Peirce is exceptional as the lead, and the characters that come into contact with him also give fine performances (notably Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano). Focusing on the problem of losing a memory after approximately 15 minutes, we begin to appreciate just how frustrating Lennys plight is. The film is beautifully shot alternating between colour and black and white (there is a logical reason), and as suggested the movie is thought provoking and intelligent. However, on my first viewing I must admit I thought it was distinctly average. Yes, its one of these films where I would urge you to watch twice, possibly three times, as I like many only appreciated it after a number of viewings. Highly innovative movie."
"OllieZ","10","0","2","9 April 2003"," The best film I have seen in years
","Memento is genuinely one of the best films I have ever seen. Guy Pearce is fantastic as Lenny, the tattooed ""detective"" searching for his wife's murderer - his only hindrance is his short term memory loss. Notes, tattoo's, polaroids are scattered around him - and they are all the memory he has.<br/><br/>A friend of mine said The Usual Suspects is the better film. I really don't think so. Yes, Suspects is extremely good, one of the best films of the 90's - but once the films has ended, it has ended. We know the twist, we know what has happened. Memento's non linear narrative means that the viewer can watch the film over and over again, and still discover new things. I watched Memento when it came out in 2000 - and up until this day, I watch it and find things I missed out before. It also lets us come up with our own conclusions, unlike Suspects. Both amazing films, but Memento pips it for pure style and narrative structure.<br/><br/>Nolan, even though this was his second feature after Following, he already cemented himself as a great director. The film flows so well, the performances are spot on, with Pearce, Moss and Joe shining. The music is downbeat, and ties in well. Here's hoping Nolan's new film, Batman Begins can match this! Best film of this century so far.<br/><br/>10."

","Memento is truly an awsome movie, one of the best i have ever seen and completely original. This is a movie which you have to sit down and watch and not pause it or turn it off or fall asleep & especially not watch while you are drunk or stoned. The film follows Leonard (Guy Pearce) a regular guy from San Francisco trying to find out who raped & murdered his wife. One problem. He has a short term memory loss. Solution. He uses tattoo's & photo's to remember certain things. Ie. where he is staying, his car, the people he knows. The film itself goes backwards and forwards. Your probably saying what the hell is this guy talking about. Well in the movie there are colour scenes & black & white scenes. The black & white scenes are going forward & they are before Leonard has found the person who raped & murdered his wife. The colour scenes are going backwards so right at the start we see Guy Pearce blow Joe Pantolianos brains out (don't worry this isn't a spoiler as it happens right at the start) then we see a black and white scene then we see the scene before Pearce shot Pantoliano and how it got to the first scene and so fourth throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan has just done something i would like to do and that is to breakout through writing & directing one of the greatest movies in the history of film & have it shown. The performances in this film are brilliant from Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano & Carrie-Anne Moss. The script is bursting with originality and is a must see movie for anyone who enjoys a good movie. Don't waste money in renting it, BUY IT! RIGHT NOW! because i can assure you, you won't be dissapointed. 10/10"

"paul-daniels3","9","0","2","24 March 2003"," Memento is a unique film in many regards
","'Memento' is edited in a way unlike any other movie I have seen. The story in the film is played out backwards in time; this break in the linear timeline of the film is similar to that of 'Last Year At Marienbad'. As you watch the show, you will see about 15 minutes of the story, then it will cut to a scene about 15 minutes before the start of the last segment you saw. So, to try and explain it more clearly, its like if all the scenes in the movies are played in the reverse order (so, instead of going from scene A to scene B, 'Memento' shows the scenes from scene Z to scene Y). This style forces you pay attention to what you have just seen, and remember it. Doing the film this way changes the show into more of a puzzle, a puzzle that you figure out over time. The effect of the movie as a whole is that it causes you to question your own memories (since Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce, does not have the ability to form new short term memories), you question what it would be like if you could not create new short-term memories. For that matter, this film raises the question of if you can trust your own memories (did you really ever go to the store, or do you just think you went to the store?) Personally, this show caused me to considered what it would be like if I could not trust any empirical information or knowledge. Because of how different this film is, and how it forces you to think while you watch it (unlike most movies today), I enjoyed 'Memento' very much."

"suicidedd","10","0","2","17 March 2003"," Not for the stupid
","Memento is quite simply the best thriller of all time. This is a completely original backwards thriller with outstanding performances from its entire cast and a screenplay that is unmatched by any other movie in history. I wanted Memento to keep going for as long as possible, to keep revealing pieces of its intricate puzzle. More important than anything I've just said is this: GO SEE THIS MOVIE!<br/><br/>Note: This is a very difficult movie to review without making it a spoiler, but there is nothing in the following review that will ruin the movie for anyone who has not yet seen it.<br/><br/>I had no idea of what this movie was going to be like when I walked into the theatre, but I was hooked from beginning to end. First, the performances by Matrix veterans Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are masterful. Their characters play the audience just like they play Leonard, and that is what makes them so compelling. Pantoliano especially shines here in a performance similar to some of Joe Pesci's academy award caliber work. But the real prize goes to Guy Pearce who really puts himself on the map with a surprisingly sympathetic performance as a man out to get revenge for the murder of his wife. Pearce should have been recognized after his performance in the critically acclaimed L.A. Confidential, but he still remained in the dark due to the box office mediocrity of that film. Here we get to see his true potential in a role that should at least nab him a best actor Oscar nomination if not a win.<br/><br/>Additional praise MUST be given to Christopher Nolan who both wrote and directed this film, which was spawned from a short story written by his brother, Jonathan Nolan. Christopher's first film, a black and white piece called `The Following' (another must see film), displayed that he was a director with infinite potential. With Memento Nolan not only shows that he is for real, but also establishes himself as one of the premiere screenwriters and directors of the new generation.<br/><br/>We see Nolan's effect from the first scene of the movie: a brilliant shot of a Polaroid fading instead of developing. But this is just a taste of things to come in this backwards movie. After it is completely faded, the picture pops back into Leonard's camera and the entire opening scene plays backwards ending with Leonard shooting Teddy in the head. Throughout the rest of the movie, Nolan uses his color scenes to represent elements starting from the `end' and going backwards in time and he uses black and white to start at the `beginning' and go forward in time. Confused yet? Well, if that's not enough, the black and white scenes and the color scenes actually merge into one in the end of the movie so the final scene can finally piece together this intriguing and complex puzzle. Additionally, the color scenes overlap with each other and we have more and more revealed to us with each scene. This is technically the opposite of Leonard's experience, yet at the same times it allows us to feel exactly how Leonard feels because we are slowly given information until the end when everything comes together.<br/><br/>I realize that what I said above may have been more than confusing, but that is how this movie plays out. Most viewers will need to see it at least twice to get the full experience of what Memento has to offer, and most viewers will also want to watch it a third, fourth, fifth, etc. time. This movie truly gets better with each viewing because you pick up new elements along the way each time. Personally, I picked up more on the `Sammy Jenkis' story. Sammy was a man that Leonard liked to talk about because also had a short-term memory problem. I did not fully understand the meaning behind this story until I saw it my second time, but Sammy Jenkis is just the tip of the iceberg. You won't be disappointed in the least bit unless you only see this movie once."
"Pavel-8","10","0","2","12 March 2003"," One of the best ever.
","**Warning!  Mild Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>After watching this slick and unique thriller, I was partially confused and entirely satisfied.  The concept of telling part of the story backwards, while not completely original, brought a freshness to the movie and provided that rare and enjoyable thinking theater experience.  Days, weeks, months, even years after I first saw it, I still discuss it w/ friends as we argue about what really happened.  <br/><br/>The acting was stellar.  Carrie-Anne Moss surprised as a foul-mouthed vixen with questionable motives.  Guy Pearce displayed his confusion and intentions subtly and effectively.  Joe Pantoliano was his usual solid self as the shady Teddy.  And the supporting cast filled their roles admirably. <br/><br/>
Plus, the film was technically superior.  The timing of the jumps back and forth in time was perfect.  What makes the film is the script and the direction.  This would not have been an easy story to tell in chronological order, let alone in this manner.  Christopher Nolan has the story completely under his control the entire time, providing a tight and taut film experience.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Flat-out brilliant film-making and story-telling. One of the best films I've ever seen.  I don't throw high ratings around, but this one earned 10 of 10."

"the_bishop","9","0","2","12 February 2003"," The main reason this film is so good!
","The main reason this film is so good is that it puts the viewer directly in the shoes of the lead character. Leonard Shelby has a condition which renders his short term memory all but useless in fact he can't remember something that happened to him as recently as ten minutes ago. So how could the viewer possibly identify with him, well the film is shown backwards ; the film begins at the end and plays in scenes of 5 to 10 minutes in the length and the beginning of the scene you have just watched coincides with the end of the scene you are about to see. This mechanic allows you to peice together parts of the mystery just as Shelby is having to do. It sounds complicated, and to a certain extent it is, but no film maker has tried this approach before and I doubt anyone will try it again. As for the plot well to put it simply in the accident that caused Shelby's condition his wife was raped and murdered and he is seeking to take revenge on the killer. The accident is the last thing he can remember and understandably he is haunted by it and hopes that finding and killing the attacker will give him some closure. Revealing any more would spoil some of the best plot twists you will ever see all I can say is go to your local video store and rent it NOW!"

","Memento is about Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man who lost his short term memory after being jumped from behind while attacking his wife's rapists/murderers.  He spends his life as a drifter, trying to hunt down the man responsible (I'm pretty sure he shot the first of the two rapists - I can't remember now).  Because of his condition, he must carry a series of sticky notes and photos to remind himself of where he is and what he's doing; his life is heavily based on routine.<br/><br/>Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) is apparently Leonard's somewhat annoying friend.  He tries to help Leonard track this man down, while simultaneously looking out for him, warning him to stay away from Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss), who he says is only trouble.  She says the exact opposite.<br/><br/>The trick to this movie is, aside from black-and-white interludes of Leonard on the phone with a stranger, the whole thing goes backwards; i.e., the beginning of each scene coincides with the end of the scene which you will see next.  Chris Nolan wrote and directed this little gem; I don't think anyone but the guy who wrote it could grasp it enough to bring it to life.<br/><br/>As far as the plot and dialogue goes, it is actually original enough to where it could be good without the backwards progression - i've never seen such a crime-thriller with a character with such a condition.  But the fact that Nolan shot this backwards, and made it work, makes this not good, but great.  This is a thinking movie - if you just got off Friday from a long week at work and want to relax with a movie, don't rent this.  Memento would be best on weekends when you and preferably a group of people have time to watch it over and try to figure it out.<br/><br/>Added bonus on the DVD - there's a second version of the movie that plays forward, so you can see the scenes in chronological order.<br/><br/>And kudos to the cast, especially Pantoliano.

"Marrissey","7","0","2","22 January 2003"," Some films are best forgotten.
","For some reason, and I can never work out why, some films just seem to cast a veil over the viewers' eyes. Take the Sixth Sense, a distinctly mediocre film, with a tenuous and inconsistent twist thrown in at the end, and resultantly worshiped with an astonishingly devout following. Sadly, I must make the same comment about this supposed ""modern classic"". Yes, the film goes backwards - but rather than being the stylish and clever representation of the lead character's memory recollection, this stands out as a cheap trick that ultimately masks a simple and rather stale plot that would never come off in a film shot in the conventional fashion. While I cannot discredit Christopher Nolan for using such a cheap trick, since it has worked so effectively, I find it disappointing that gimmicks still equal box office success and acclaim.<br/><br/>So what would be so bad about ""Memento"" if it ran in a simple and straightforward order? Well, for a start, the acting is distinctly mediocre, with every single character seemingly exuding as little charisma as possible. Guy Pearce plays a fairly straight lead role, in a film which probably afforded more acting than Pearce provided, however his performance is passable, but not particularly laudable. Carrie-Anne Moss displays a similar mediocre style, with little really to draw the viewer in. For me, Joe Pantoliano's character provides the only real intrigue, seeming a bit of an enigma, as the viewer puzzles over what the truth really is, con-man or comrade?<br/><br/>There can be no doubt ""Memento""'s concept is absolutely superb, but it is the execution which holds the most serious problem for the film. The lead character's life holds little interest, and when the alleged truth is finally unveiled, it left me amazingly under whelmed. Essentially, a story that could be explained in a sentence, is dragged out to 113 minutes. While many seem to believe that the plot itself is what ""messes with your head"", it is transparent that the order change and fractionality is all that really perplexes the viewer, and left me feeling cheated out of a concept that could have been put to much better use. The memory loss idea is fairly consistently executed, and for this the film must be praised. Indeed, pulling off a man who can remember nothing must have been a real challenge for Pearce, however a bit more emotion would have been nice, and a little less of the suave!<br/><br/>It would be hard for me to entirely damn this movie, since the concept itself holds such intrigue. However, I find it hard to fully praise a film that owes its success to a singular idea. Yes, it's entertaining, but not nearly as good or as complicated as some would like you to believe. Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if the normal order feature on the DVD release makes for far more boring viewing.<br/><br/>7/10 (on the value of the idea alone)."

","This film is pure excellence. Much like Usual Suspects in 1995 this is a brilliantly written piece of low budget magic. It is original and surprising and has gone down as a cult classic, and deservedly so.<br/><br/>Much like Usual Suspects this doesn't have any out and out big Hollywood stars but does have some great actors who are recognizable. The film centres around Leonard Shelby, a man whose wife was brutally murdered also leaving him with a memory disorder, where by he cannot create new memories, so while trying to hunt down the killer he has to contend with the fact he forgets things in a matter of minutes. He overcomes this by routines, he writes things down, takes pictures and also tattoos himself. <br/><br/>This isn't, as most will know, a start to finish sort of film. The ingenious part is that the film starts with the end basically. Leonard has found the killer, played by Joe Pantoliano, and he kills him. Then the film plays backwards revealing how he tracked down the killer and some important facts he forgot.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce is very good in the lead, he certainly shows enough here to have warranted an Oscar nomination had he got one, and also Carrie Anne Moss as Natalie, who may or may not be a friend to help Leonard. Joe Pantoliano was as usual very good as were the rest of the cast. <br/><br/>This film is fantastic, genuinely surprising and a real lesson to the big Hollywood studio, that the art of writing a clever film is not dead. 10/10"
"iota_","Null","0","2","8 January 2003"," overrated? You Decide
","Yes yes this movie has been a tad overrated.  Good reason for this though - it has unusual elements to its edit. I wouldn't call it totally original (the fact that the scenes run from end to beginning in reverse chronological order) however it was an excellent choice of edit given the main characters 'disability' of not being able to remember what happened to him 15 minutes ago as it ensures the audience don't have a clue what happened either.<br/><br/>Personally I really enjoyed this movie as you DO need to keep a firm hold on what's happening, to be able to follow the plot.  It's a movie well worth watching more than once to catch how all the story elements come together.<br/><br/>However a friend of mine watching it was bored to tears.  He felt it was disjointed, half of it irrelevant, with a thin plot.  He wanted to be entertained for an hour and a half and to sit back and enjoy a good movie, not have to constantly try to recall what he'd just seen and how one scene met another.<br/><br/>I felt the acting was good, the edit fantastic, the concept and idea a breath of fresh air, and the lack of flashy special effects refreshing given how many films overuse these at present.<br/><br/>However, the use of non-chronological sequences is a great idea, but if the movie cannot hold its own when you run the scenes in chronological order then it becomes nothing more than a gimmick.<br/><br/>Would Memento have been 'all that' if they had chosen to run it in from beginning to end rather than end to beginning? Would there have been any element of surprise?  Could the film still be seen as being a thriller with a great plot?  You decide ..."
"stefan-144","7","0","2","12 January 2003"," How memorable, really?
","Memento is a reminder or a warning, as in the classic expression: Memento mori, remember that you will die. It is grim, but also helpful. Shouldn't we live our lives like that? Should we not, like Leonard in the movie, reexamine our whole situation, each morning after waking up?<br/><br/>When Leonard fights his incapacitated short-memory, to catch the killer of his wife and avenge her, he has found a simple, straightforward meaning to his life, easily filling each new moment of his days - and there are many. Upon completion, what can he possibly do to keep such a sense of purpose? It's pretty much a no-win situation.<br/><br/>But the movie is fascinating, mainly because of it staying, as Kurt Vonnegut called it in 'Slaughterhouse 5', ""unstuck in time"". This opens for a refreshing narration, keeping your eyes open and your mind awake. It is done with great skill, too, so that it almost becomes natural, as if time is supposed to work like this.<br/><br/>My problem is with the characters. In this staccato form, they do not really get any depth, are not explored to the extent where I feel I know what makes them tick. The characters become like the plot itself: cut up in tiny pieces, and scrambled.<br/><br/>That would be Ok, too, if it were not for the ending (which I will not give away here). The ending - well, the beginning, sort of - loses credibility by the fact that we have gotten to know too little about the main characters, to anchor it in. Not as bad as a deus ex machina intervention in the last minute, but still. I don't feel the ending to be what Aristotle meant by 'necessary', and I don't know enough about the characters to say what would have been such an ending.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this shortcoming makes the film less memorable than it otherwise deserves to be."

I'm sure someone has a better summary.<br/><br/>The fascination with this movie is how it affects you as you watch it unfold revealing itself and how it makes you feel afterwards. Then you come out with different opinions to the ending. Amazing.There are a limited number of movies that can affect you like this. Its rare nowadays that you can still spook and boggle the minds of today's audiences.<br/><br/> This movie confused me at first, yet I felt spooked and then after a second viewing the story unfolded right before my eyes, it scared the sh*t out of me.

"simondajo","9","0","2","7 January 2003"," A man's ""memento"" of his murdered wife is the fact that the sight of her lying dead was his last real memory.
","I have read some critic's remarks about this marvelous film, and<br/><br/>many complain that it is too complicated and incomprehensible;<br/><br/>well, it is supposed to be; and there is no need to see it a second<br/><br/>time if you were confused. The intention of the writer / director was<br/><br/>to show how life for us is simply a combination of short memories, <br/><br/>which we can omit, extend, devote our lives to, confuse ourselves<br/><br/>with etc. The film demonstrates wonderfully what chaos happens<br/><br/>when we lose these short term memories, and combined with this<br/><br/>is a refreshingly fractured plot, which we can make no sense out<br/><br/>of, like Leonard himself. We are cleverly and disturbingly placed<br/><br/>into the mind of Leonard and leave the theater wondering and<br/><br/>confused, just like he drives off with absolutely no resolution. Don't<br/><br/>we get tired of films that are resolved in the end?; our own lives are<br/><br/>mostly unresolved, and the film magically reflects this feeling. One<br/><br/>criticism I read was the question of why Leonard didn't use a tape<br/><br/>recorder to capture his memories; the answer is simple, and he<br/><br/>points it out in the film; if he lost it he would lose everything ( most<br/><br/>of his important facts to remember are tattooed on him for this<br/><br/>reason ), and also he realizes the sheer impact of visual memory;<br/><br/>his ""records"" are either visual or written on himself. Remember he<br/><br/>is a very intelligent perceptive guy, which is why he was good at his<br/><br/>job testing insurance claims; and he also repeatedly reflects the<br/><br/>importance of speaking to someone face to face...here again<br/><br/>comes in the impact of vision ( seeing the eyes and body<br/><br/>language etc  ) ...this may be an indirect criticism of the growing<br/><br/>trend of Internet friendships and dating, where mostly you just see<br/><br/>or hear words. Another criticism raised by the well known critic<br/><br/>Roger Ebert is the idea that if seeing his wife was the last thing he<br/><br/>remembered, why could he always remember he had short term<br/><br/>memory loss? Well the answer to this is pointed out in the film as<br/><br/>well, and also when you understand short term memory loss the<br/><br/>solution becomes simple ( these talented film makers do<br/><br/>research, unlike some well known critics ). Leonard points out that<br/><br/>he is different from the poor guy with a similar disorder but who is<br/><br/>completely incapacitated, and ends up in a nursing home;<br/><br/>Leonard would have been told by doctors about his condition, and<br/><br/>he sees it as crucial to remember he has a problem, which is why<br/><br/>he is constantly repeating it to people and I'm sure in his own<br/><br/>mind; he is fighting it all the time. Also the experts say the<br/><br/>condition comes in different degrees, and that a good method of<br/><br/>rehabilitation is constantly repeating things and thoughts; he can<br/><br/>also remember where he parks his car, leaves his keys; everyday<br/><br/>things. The problems he encounters in the film are not everyday,<br/><br/>making his struggle all the more difficult. Therefore another<br/><br/>message we may gain is to admit openly that we have a problem<br/><br/>and not repress it, such as alcoholism. For me the film is<br/><br/>faultless. It is absolutely confusing and disjointed, even<br/><br/>meaningless on the surface; well to me thats what life is."
"Naggastos","9","0","2","5 January 2003"," Brief thoughts on a terrific movie
","I found Memento to be one of those truly remarkable films that stays with you long after watching it (be it the 1st time, or the 4th).<br/><br/>The main point of interest is how the film is edited; it basically runs backwards in time, showing the last occurrence first and vice versa. This could be seen as a cheap stunt to generate interest, but it turns out to be an extremely effective and clever technique. The main character, Leonard, is an anterograde amnesiac - he can't form new lasting memories after his head injury. Whatever he experiences he can only remember for less than a minute. Therefore Nolan has placed us in his shoes, not knowing what came before, but slowly finding out.<br/><br/>The social/moral content in this film basically revolves around Leonard's plight, and his dubious actions. A year or so before the film's setting, when he sustained his head injury in a brawl with a home invader, his wife was killed (supposedly by the invader). This sent him on a mission of revenge to track down and murder the perpetrators. As he can't form new memories, he has to write himself 'mementos'. Most are on Polaroid photos, and he even goes so far as to tattoo important notes on his body. Though he wouldn't even remember himself getting revenge if he succeeds, he believes that justice for his wife will be done nonetheless. This attitude, combined with his memory loss, leads him to make some very bad decisions which I can't go into without spoiling somewhat.<br/><br/>Anyway, the acting is quite good all round, especially the humourous Teddy (played by Joe Pantoliano, the traitor in The Matrix). The main musical theme is a very eerie tune and seems to set the tone for Leonard's sad and ultimately destroyed life. The ending of the film (along with much of the rest of it) was very confusing and quite open to interpretation, but nevertheless striking.<br/><br/>Recommended to anyone who wants a challenging, intelligent breakaway from mainstream tripe."

Now put yourself in the place of someone who has this condition, yet is trying to find his wife's killer.  The story is not, as you would expect, about the search for the killer, but about the way the search is carried out.  <br/><br/>Guy Pearce has proved here that he is in the Hollywood A list, a far cry from tacky Australian Soap, Neighbours - a long journey hindered at the start with his performance in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.  And an unheard of director brings fresh approaches to the murder mystery film.  Why this film did not win awards by the bucketload is beyond me.

","First off, Memento has the best screenplay of any movie I've ever seen, and I am especially surprised that the screenplay Oscar went to Gosford Park rather than this far more deserving candidate. The screenplay is simply unique. However, this is no gimmick - having watched the movie in chronological order (thanks to the wonders of DVD) I am convinced that the story holds its own even without Nolan's remarkable narrative structure. The acting equals the screenplay, especially with Guy Pearce who confirms his quality as the central character of Leonard, who is attempting to locate his wife's killer.<br/><br/>I'm loathe to give away too much about the film, but it is definitely one of the more thought-provoking pieces to appear on our screens in recent years.

","A man who has suffered a brain injury preventing him from storing new memories tries to solve his wife's murder.  His injury allows him to be easily manipulated and makes it difficult for him to put the clues together to solve the mystery.  The entire film is constructed in flashback so the viewer learns clues as the main character learns them.  At the same time you are trying to determine who is helping him and who is using him.  One of the most original scripts ever is brought to life rather well by Christopher Nolan.  Fans of the film should check out his earlier effort 'Following'."
"Streetwolf","8","0","2","5 January 2003"," It's backwards but great!
","I was wondering what this movie was like so I finally rented it.<br/><br/>Summary: The ending is at the beginning when Leonard kills someone. The with lots of flashbacks we walk through his life ever since his wife was raped and murdered in their home whilst Leonard had his skull bashed against a mirror. To the present, he suffers from short term memory loss, he can't make new memories and only can remember his past and now puts all his efforts into finding the killer of his wife by using notes, pictures and tattoos all over his body with clues and facts to remind him how far he has gotten with his mission, but everyone who knows about his condition messes with him even more.<br/><br/>It was a very confusing movie that really didn't have an ending at all, but I got to see a different prospective, it was almost like you feel sorry for Leonard because he has no idea what he is doing at all and people are using him and he has no clue whatsoever. In another way the ""condition"" as he refers to every 5 minutes is some way a payback due to one of his insurance investigations that resembled a case of another person who suffered this condition. It's amazing to see a man doing everything in his power above his limits trying to keep everything in prospective even though he forgets about it a few minutes after.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce was great in this movie as Leonard, who lets people know the problem he has yet doesn't want anybody to pity him so he stays strong in his struggle. It's great to see Guy has come so far ever since he left the Australian series Neighbours.<br/><br/>I rate this movie 8/10, the plot was great, but it did confuse me. His wife is raped and murdered, he is out looking for a guy he doesn't even know, but how did the other characters get involved?<br/><br/>My favourite lines in this movie were : Natalie: ""So what's the last thing you remember?"" Leonard: ""My wife...."" Natalie: ""That's sweet"" Leonard: ""...dying...""......."

The screenplay, the acting, the story...amazing.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/> The basic idea of this movie is that Guy Pearce's character can't remember anything since an attack in which his wife was killed. We see two lines of action, one in color, one in black and white. The color one moves backward. What we see first is the end of the story. The other one moves forward. It is the beginning of the story. When they meet at the end of the film, black and white turns to color and everything makes sense.<br/><br/>Part of the genius of doing the movie backwards is that we, the audience, don't know any more than Guy Pearce's character does, since what happened in the prior scene hasn't actually happened yet.<br/><br/>The only criticism I can possibly think of this movie is that it's difficult to follow.

Watch it, however, and it takes your breath away.<br/><br/>Nolan's triumph in this film is the perfect marriage of form and content. How you you make an original, engaging thriller?  A conventional approach is to confuse the viewer, cut the story up into lots of separate threads that are only re-united in the ending.  Yawn yawn yawn! But this is a film about a man with memory loss. Each moment is new to him, because he never knows what happened before.  So Nolan tells his story in reverse, capturing his character's utter placelessness and simultaneous assembling a plot that is complex, baffling, yet original and natural at the same time, its structure just the consequence of its hero's plight.<br/><br/>This is audacious, but Nolan pulls it off.

","Very, very clever - making the audience empathise with the lead character by manipulating the time line. Not since 'The Usual Suspects' have I seen a film which so cleverly played with the viewer's perceptions as the central plot device. The sheer effort required to study every detail of every scene ensures that you just can't take your eyes away from the screen for a second in case you miss something. However...<br/><br/>Without the reversal of the time line the movie is a low-key affair with some OK acting and artistic camera work: Guy Pearce makes a passable hero and Joe Pantoliano obviously wishes his surname were Pesci instead.<br/><br/>But after the final frame of the film I had that feeling of 'so what' which is the dread of every film fan - at least when you know a film is crap before you see it, you're never disappointed by it - occasionally you find that it's not as bad as you were told.<br/><br/>But when a film is lauded as a landmark and voted into a top 10 placing as a result, you expect a little more. This film is a long way from crap though - the problem is that the concept IS the film and it can't quite carry the plot. Consequently, you're left with a feeling of resentment at having to expend all of the effort required to unravel the mystery."

","Ok, basically this movie shows us the quest of a man, who cannot create new memories, in search of his wife killer. Since he can't remember a person or a conversation only a few minutes after he had it, he has to use photos and notes to keep track of his progresses. First of all the acting is great! Pearce, Moss and Pantoliano are amazing in this movie, i specially liked Pearce, after L.A. Confidential he really estabilished himself as a first rate actor. The direction is also very good and the way the story is told puts us into Shelby's (Pearce) shoes... knowing what he's gonna do but not what he's done, just like the character! But the best part for me is the story itself... it's complex but not boring and, in the end, gives enough answers but leaves some minor questions in the air (i love movies like this!!). If you go watch it with 10 persons you're gonna get 5 different opinions at the end. And if you watch it twice you still gonna find more details that slipped you the first time!<br/><br/>If you don't like to think much in the cinema and prefer action packed films or romantic flicks, don't bother seeing this one, but if you like a good, exciting puzzle thats keeps you on the edge of your sit for the entire movie and thinking about it afterwards... go watch it now!

","In the beginning of the film, when I learned that Leonard (Guy Pearce) had no short term memory since his accident and wife's murder, I accepted it easily.  But then I got to thinking, assuming he was told about his memory loss after the accident, how could he remember that he had this problem?  To me, that flaw could derail the film but like Alfred Hitchcock's MacGuffin, I just let it go.  The reason for the film's success is that by telling the story backwards, we are just like Leonard, we learn everything when he does and there is no way for us to piece things together.  This makes it practically impossible to figure things out.  In ""The Lady in the Lake"", director Robert Montgomery tried to make the audience feel like the main character, Philip Marlowe, by showing everything from Marlowe's point of view.  It didn't work mainly because it was too weird to have everyone in the movie treating the audience like a character.  ""Memento"" succeeds where Montgomery failed.  As for the acting, Pearce plays Leonard a little too intense, probably the way someone would really act but at times too much for the screen.  Carrie-Anne Moss does nothing to distinguish herself and her berating of Leonard was embarrassing to watch.  Joe Pantoliano as the mysterious Teddy, has his best performance to date.  A film that will definitely make you think.  What would you do?"

","Here is the deal with Memento. Some viewers feel it is a film that doesn't deserve its rank of #10 on the top 250 films of all time. My response to all those who say that: huh? This is a film that will withstand the test of time simply because there was never a movie before to walk through a story like this one did. These same people would probably also say movies such as, ""Man With A Movie Camera"", or ""Nanook Of The North"" were fads and people would forget about them in a few years. WRONG! Here is a fact for you, when a movie starts a genre, it never dies. Memento started a genre of style of film that will infinitely live on simply because other directors will try to mimic Nolans style in this flick at least to some extent. Films like this cannot be praised enough, because these movies in forty years will be watched by our grandchildren and great grandchildren and even they will be appreciative of it. Guy Pierce in this film is the classic example of an actor that is truly terrible, and has the same exact style in every single movie he ever makes and because of the character, he totally pulls it off! Carrie-Ann Moss is stellar as she is in every movie she does, and deserved at least a best supporting nod for this. Joe Pantoliano also puts in a tremendous acting job, could be considered his best to date. hmmm 2 matrix actors...Other great performances in this were put in by Mark Boone Junior and Stephen Tobolowsky. On top of a great cast where supporting actors are as good as anything, the movie style by Nolan is legendary. Nolan had already made an amazing film in ""Following"", and after ""Memento"", did a tremendous job with his third film ""Insomnia"", the man is on pace to be one of the greatest directors of our time, and also possibly of all-time! This film can be easily understood after 1 time through if you actually think, and has replay value, but unlike movies like ""Fight Club"", the replay value does run out, which is why it gets a 9/10 instead of a perfect score.

","Overrated? Hardly. Memento has occupied its lofty perch as one of IMDB's most highly rated films for 2 years with good reason. Most intelligent people get it. Often they only understand it in the way we recognize great art. We may not fully appreciate the techniques used by a Monet or a Van Gogh. We may not understand what the artist is trying to `say', but if we are honest, we must admit that we like the final result. Memento is as close to a great painting as anything I've seen in cinema. It can be admired on so many levels-the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the sound, the editing, and the story. However, I think Christopher Nolan's greatest achievement is that he not only puts you in the protagonist's shoes, but he proves beyond any doubt that memory is unreliable and that memories cannot be trusted. How many films accomplish so much? Very few."
"brooksmurphy-1","10","0","2","9 October 2002"," The most innovative film ever to grace the cinema!
","`What if I just forget about what I've done.what if I just pretend it never happened.' This is a quote from Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) as he speaks of his own acts in the film `Memento'. Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan, adapted from a short story by his brother John Nolan; `Memento' is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. This is such a tough film to break down, due to its complexity; but I believe once you do break it down, you'll have a feeling of accomplishment that you would never have figuring out any other movie.<br/><br/>Looking at this film broadly, it seems so simple: `Memento' is a psychological thriller about a man seeking revenge on his wife's rapist and killer. This is definitely a classic storyline. As you indulge yourself deeper into it, you find that the main character has a memory condition called Short-term Amnesia. This is a rare case where you remember your past before your accident, but you can't remember what you've done fifteen minutes ago, after your accident. To top that off, the film is edited where the last scene is the beginning and the beginning scene is the last.<br/><br/>Although the film is structured oddly, many claim that this film is non-linear, but it's actually more linear than most films. If this film weren't as linear as it actually is, it wouldn't even work. The only obstruction is that the film is shown chronologically backwards by scene.<br/><br/>As the film unfolds, the audience sees the darker side of the protagonist, which wasn't often seen in Classic Cinema. This is also true with the storyline; like the character, the stories weeds off and changes the audiences' perspective. The balance in the film is barely apparent and the key to this film, I believe, is disruption. This film was meant, among other things, to trick the audience. The great part about this film is, other than the disorder of scenes chronologically; this film hardly ever manipulates the audience with tricky character placements and camera shots. The only way it does, is through it's main character Leonard Shelby and this is due to the fact that he has a memory condition. Therefore, his mind is foggy and very uncertain. This mentality of the main character transcends beautifully upon the audience. This is one of the only films to ever do this.<br/><br/>Technically, this film is a basic marvel. Veteran editor Dody Dorn: who was nominated for several awards, superbly pieced this film together. I loved the subtle photography and the ambient music and sound. Any dramatized musical score would have probably ruined the film.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great story powered by great acting from the entire cast. The editing is sheer and flawless, with obstructions of only intentional means. The screenplay couldn't have been better, even from the simplistic basic story that the film displayed. Christopher Nolan is a prime example of a dedicated filmmaker, with so many aspirations for originality. A marvel accomplishment and one of the greatest films of all time!"

And for those out there who feel compelled to chuck this movie into the category of ""murder mystery"" have you ever thought that maybe this movie was not intended to be placed in that catagory?

Anyway, the story involves a dude who has some sort of long term memory loss and can only remember things with Polaroid photos and notes that he's tatooed onto himself.  Like the Usual Suspects, we get swallowed up in the mystery, but here we are not so much wondering 'whodunit' as 'what is going on here.'  This works for 75% of the movie, but there are bits in the middle and the ending especially drag it down a notch.  I loved watching it, but at the end felt cheated.  Maybe it merits another look-see as I certainly got confused while watching it.  This is a good movie, but it's not one that you'll be raving about for years on end like Pulp Fiction.

"postps","Null","0","3","7 August 2002"," *WARNING, SPOILERS* symbols in Memento
","** WARNING, THERE ARE SPOILERS IN HERE**<br/><br/>I thought this movie was brilliant.  Like many other viewers, I'd say a person would need to watch it carefully several times to get the most out of it.<br/><br/>After reading several viewer comments, I noticed that nobody seems to understand that the plot is a parable of soul struggle and ascension.  So I'm going to put forth a few ideas I've had about what some of the details in this film mean.  Perhaps other fans of this film will benefit from them in some way.<br/><br/>The scenes that are in black in white are those that occurred after the wife's murder but before Teddy's murder.  It's a ""dark night of the soul"" kind of setting.  The scenes in color are those that occurred after Teddy's murder.  These latter scenes represent Leonard's ability to remember the love his wife felt for him and, ultimately, his ability to love.  The murder completely flattened and destroyed Leonard's emotional life; he has lost his primary object and his reason for living.  I believe the wife is a symbol for Leonard's ability to love and live like a human being:  the female side of his personality.  In order to gain access to that lost part of himself, he is absolutely driven to avenge the murder.  Leonard's desire to resolve the conflict and kill the murderer is the only reason he finds to stay alive.  If I had no ability to recall anything truly good and present in the world since a devastating trauma, I might think along his lines, too! What a courageous character!!<br/><br/>Leonard knows that he must relinquish memories of his wife while working toward stopping her killer.  He burns her personal effects and in tiny flashing glimpses is able to relive her memory and the extreme and constant pain her loss brought about.  It's not sentimental though.  It's motivational.  Leonard brings his life and ego to the point of extreme thinness in order to end the loss and end the cycle of abuse.  Leonard lost a great deal (a lot is to be inferred from this movie about how huge an investment marriage often is made to be in modern life) and needs to give up even what little is left to him voluntarily.  He knows that and gradually does.  Even though other characters see Leonard as a retard, he's the most brilliant character in this film -- and I'd say in many if not most films of the recent past.  He is unable to let go of his resentment, so he does everything he can to follow it toward its end.  Because of the damage that was done to his ability to recall and think, it's his only choice.  We in real life are given a choice to let go of our rage, but he cannot. Instead, he understands that he needs to completely let go of the memory of his wife in order to get it, and all the vital things in himself associated with it, back.  That's pretty wise and brave!  Those very brief glimpses of past memory ended up redeeming Leonard later in the story.  Because Leonard was willing to let go of the memory, he was able to RECEIVE a memory that was real:  Teddy tries to trick Leonard into believing that it was his wife, not Mrs. Jankis, who had diabetes and thus trick Leonard into thinking he is someone other than who he is (not a good person).  Leonard remembered that this was not the case and thus was able to find out that Teddy had been misleading him into a life of unknowingly commiting repetitive murders, and that it was Teddy's fault not his own.<br/><br/>The name Teddy reminds me of a teddy BEAR.  Bears are symbolic of egos in hibernation or an unawakened state, living by the power of negative force rather than love.  Teddy's values are certainly to be questioned; drug trade, murder, and use of an innocent person to carry out one's dirty work are certainly not productive uses of life.  The character Teddy is extremely clever, but it's a heartless and cruel kind of intellect -- also his sleazy operandi is kept secret; only his victim (barely) knows what he is doing until Natalie comes into the picture.  The name Leonard symbolizes another side of the intellect, the lion:  still brutal intellect but driven by love, even if it is only a memory of love.  Notice that Leonard is in peak physical condition and that his actions are fueled by a very intense desire to ""get his life back.""  He is doing everything he can to compensate for his memory loss, an extreme handicap.<br/><br/>The greatest question for me in the film is whether or not Leonard's action was correct.  In terms of its being a film rather than real life, I'd say yes.  He stated his intentions during the scene when he knew he was lying to himself about who the killer was, and after it happened he said that he was ""just trying to make things all right.""  In real life, one can't murder another person, but I believe the murder in this film was really a symbol of totally getting oneself together in the face of extreme disadvantages in an activity designed to wrench back control of a person's vitality that had been stolen from another person.  Teddy is literally controlling what little life Leonard has left to him, and Leonard did the right thing by freeing himself against all odds from the manipulative and power-hungry actions of this terrible man.  That the director thinks so to is denoted by the fact that color, peaceful memories of his wife, and hope come back to Leonard's vision once he has completed this near-impossible task.  What Leonard does with the life he has given back to himself is a question beyond the scope of the film.  Will Leonard go on and start over a good life?  With the intelligence he has acquired, it could go either way, but I got a huge sense of hope from the film.<br/><br/>The incidents with Jimmy the drug dealer were the weirdest for me.  The scene of the murders has large tanks with spiral ladders nearby.  I consider this whole chain of events reminiscent of soul ascension through battle and possession (i.e., non-hermetic but through personal competition).  Leonard murders Jimmy and literally takes over his life and body -- and even Jimmy's wife.  He wears his clothes and drives his car, discarding his own.  He now has the mind of a killer.  The brand of car is Jaguar, which is an animal of the unconscious.  Teddy envies Leonard's ""new"" car and tries to trick him out of driving it.  I don't clearly recall but I believe Teddy drove a battered Ford, symbolizing the crossing over into the unconscious.<br/><br/>Natalie is nothing like Leonard's dead wife.  But even though she misuses Leonard, she's doing so in order to avenge her own spousal tragedy.  She is intelligent enough to understand that Teddy was the real murderer even though Leonard was the agent.  She, not Leonard, is the first person to discover the sick life that Teddy is leading, and she uses that knowledge properly by sharing it with Leonard in one of the few ways that Leonard can understand, pretty ingenius.  She is skillful in turning Teddy's game against him.  Even though she can be considered evil, I was reminded here that it's all relative.  She ended up helping Leonard in the long run even though she had to brutalize and confuse him into committing another murder in the short term.  She gave Leonard the missing piece of information that enabled him to end the horrible repetition of violence, Teddy's drivers license.<br/><br/>Throughout the film Leonard is misused by shady characters, and that's to be expected in this modern and overmasculinized world, which is symbolized in the film by the Las Vegas desert and it's ""discount"" businesses.  Leonard keeps telling people to call him by his real name rather than ""Lenny,"" which is a nickname his wife used for him.  He shared real and consensual intimacy and love with his wife.  The intimacy he shares with other characters is because of the neurological trauma and nonconsensual, and what he experiences in their presence is fear rather than love.  He is extremely vulnerable, he knows it, and Nolan does a terrific job of conveying the paranoia that Leonard must have experienced at every (waking) moment.  I think Leonard does a terrific job of handling that fear effectively and finally ending it.  The name ""Leonard"" called to my mind the retard in that John Steinbeck story OF MICE AND MEN.  Leonard really is something of an idiot to the ""regular"" people in this film, but he eventually acquires far more power than any of them.  I believe he earns it well and well in ways that none of the ""regular"" characters possibly could because they're neither challenged nor called to task for their misuse of power.  As Leonard says to Jimmy in that first fabulously tense confrontation scene at the sight of the murders, he's not interested in the (huge amounts of) money (potential power); what he wants is his life back and nothing else.  As Leonard says to himself after the second fabulously tense confrontation scene at the sight of the murders (this time with Teddy), he is justified in making a murderous lie since that lie will end the killing and the inability to live well.<br/><br/>Memento is a fictional story about very real energy flows.  Even though literally speaking the film is about murder and a rare physiological condition and drug trade, it is symbolically about psychic battle, the memory loss associated with spiritual ascension gone awry, and empowerment/disempowerment.  Ultimately it's about satanic possession of others and divine self-possession.  And also about how self-trust, instinct, and intellect these days are more vital than ever because one can no longer automatically trust one's friends and ""helpers.""  I (obviously) was very taken by this work of art.  The structure of the film was absolutely exquisite.<br/><br/>Just thought I'd share those ideas.  Memento was one of the most thought-provoking films I've ever seen.  (Insomnia was okay but not nearly as good -- and the similar soundtrack drove me up the wall!)"

I couldn't take my eyes off it. Completely engrossing tale, told completely backwards.<br/><br/>The effect really puts you into the world of Leonard Shelby, the main character. An insurance adjuster who has been inflicted with short-term memory loss during a brutal attack that killed his wife. His world is one where he cannot understand what's happening around him because he can't remember what just happened 5 minutes ago. He is forced to take polaroids and write notes on the photographs to keep people and events straight. Watching the movie leaves the same sensation, as you don't know what happened just before.

","Christopher Nolan's Memento is a thrilling story about Lenny, who's suffered an accident trying to avoid his wife's murder, which causes him to have short-term memory loss. This film tells us the story after the murder, and how he tries to hunt down and kill his wife's murderer with the help of dodgy characters and Polaroid photos. With great flashbacks with intermissions showing Leonard talking on the phone, explaining about his condition and some things from his past, Nolan shows himself as a great promise for us thrillers' lovers who have been waiting for a long time for a director of this kind."
"SafeHouse","10","0","1","12 July 2002"," Entertaining, intelligent and thoroughly confusing (in a good way)
","Many films created today are made with the intention of satisfying a public who merely wish to be entertained on an entirely superficial basis. CGI and such improvements in technology have opened up a world where the laws of physics simply don't apply. This has lead to what often amount to be, flashy, overly expensive productions, with no real merit. Memento provides the audience the rare treat of giving the grey matter a bit of a work out, and for that I am eternally grateful.<br/><br/>I first saw this movie on a wet, Saturday night, at around 1 in the morning and was totally captivated throughout, indeed living around an hour away from the cinema I had time to utterly engross myself in deciphering its immensely confusing, though not entirely complicated plot, and still couldn't sleep that night in the knowledge that I fully understood it. I have since seen it twice more in cinemas, as well as buying the DVD, and still find myself noticing something new on every viewing. You may call me stupid but I believe this is the mark of a wonderful film.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan assembles a noir thriller, based on a short story by his brother, that places you almost entirely in the position of the protagonist. Constructed in reverse, we follow the tale of Leonard Shelby, a man who as a result head injury sustained during an assault on his wife, has no short-term memory. He's looking for his wife's killer, whilst compensating for his disability by taking Polaroid's, annotating them, and having important facts about the killers identity tattooed on his body. Along with a plot twist that left me totally blown away, this film left me feeling intrigued, as well as in awe of the originality of the story we are told.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss are all superb in their performances, and unlike in many other films where we are presented with actors who very much play individuals, unreliant on the presence of other central characters, these three present us with a unique unit without which this picture would not be possible. Within the mind of Leonard Shelby we are without continuity and it requires those with which we can identify, if only in relation to the passage of time, to allow us to benefit from witnessing the actions Leonard is unable to remember.<br/><br/>Memento though, is not without slight inconsistencies but whether or not they are inconsistencies could be discussed eternally. Despite this Memento has a brilliantly devised plot, is wonderfully crafted as well as acted, and leaves the questions unanswered that should have been. One word of warning, if you are of an irritable disposition, do not consider watching this after you have seen it with somebody who has not, I made this mistake and spent the entire film answering questions.<br/><br/>
Ironically perhaps the best way for a film to make money is to combine a story so confusing and yet thoroughly entertaining, the audience is forced to see it numerous times in order to fully understand it. Apparently, from its success this may have been the case, though that is cynic inside me talking."

Memento is just too flawed, despite its ingenuity, to be rated as a great among greats.

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","0","1","26 June 2002"," Some films are best forgotten however this film is way too good to slip from your head.
","`Memento' is great, and it's not without reason that it's hovering outside IMDB's Top 10. There's a reason why<br/><br/>The plot might initially seem simple. A man is hunting down the murderer of his wife, seeking out the clues that will lead him to the man. However there's a twist  the man, Leonard (Guy Pearce), - has no short-term memory. He cannot form new memories so, if he is told something, he will forget it minutes later unless he records it as part of his catalogue of information (which is written not just on note paper, but, when important, as tattoos on his body). Thus any acquaintances he has made will seem strangers and he won't know if he can trust them unless he's got some record of them. However how reliable can these notes be?<br/><br/>As intriguing as those notes are, it's the way the script that plays out that really catapults `Memento'. If we, as a viewer, constantly saw Leonard forget people it would become tedious. Therefore writer/director Christopher Nolan took an innovative step to scene order. The main storyline's scene order is chronologically reversed  we see what happens last (time frame wise) as the first scene. The next scene will end where the first scene started. In between each of these main scenes are shorter scenes, filmed in black and white, which are telling a shorter piece of the story  this time in chronological order and taking place before the main narrative. As confusing as this sounds it works very well because it forces the viewer to be alert  they must work out what led Leonard to perform a certain action based on events they will not witness until later. Things are not always as they seem, principally because of Leonard's debilitating condition  twists and turns abound in the storyline but none seem forced, or incredulous, because they make perfect sense for Leonard's later actions.<br/><br/>The acting is spot on. Guy Pearce has certainly shrugged off the image I formed of him from his days on Australian soap operas. Here he has hardened himself  both physically and mentally  to play an intensely focused man, who has only one goal he can remember: make someone pay for his wife's death. There's not much joy in this person but the tightly coiled energy invested by Peace. The two principal supporting characters, familiar to fans of `The Matrix', are also played well. Joe Pantoliano is great as Teddy, a man claiming to be assisting Leonard, because he plays the character with just enough element of sliminess, that you can't anticipate where his true motives are. Carrie-Anne Moss, as another associate of Leonard, shows far more skill than `The Matrix' let her evidence as she gets to show a greater emotional range and depth, all played with a cool, convincing authority.<br/><br/>Nolan deserves a lot of credit, and not just because of the aforementioned smartness of the script. His camera work and lighting is spot on, capturing the brooding nature of Leonard by nearly constantly focusing on Leonard, without more distancing long shots. Judicious editing helps the narrative flow greatly, and allows for repeated viewings to uncover extra elements and layers to the story that were previously over looked. The soundtrack is extremely minimal, and that works to the advantage of the movie because it does not distract the viewer from the story unfolding.<br/><br/>Is the movie flawless? Well I have no real problems with any area of the production. The story is engaging and does stand under repeated viewings. The narrative technique cannot really be dismissed as a gimmick because it works so very well and is an essential element of the story. Having grand performances all round, and with Nolan showing a smart hand with direction, makes `Insomnia' a must-see movie, particularly if you're dulled by the constant pop-corn nature of many Hollywood flicks. Highly recommended  9.3/10."
"joeleejoel","10","0","1","24 June 2002"," sub-lim discovered
","There is a sublim at 1:29:28.  In a b&w sequence (forward), Leonard is talking to a mystery man on the phone (obviously Teddy) just finishing up the story of Sammy Jankis where Sammy is sitting pathetically in a Home, after he's killed Mrs. J.  But after the camera goes behind a pillar and returns, the one seated in the home is not Sammy, for a split-second, but Leonard.  This is not evident in normal speed.  I discovered it as I was splitting the movie into 43 discrete segments, and arranging their playback in absolute linearity.  <br/><br/>That's only important insofar as that's how I found this sublim.  It's very subtle and, though not over the top in reach (it's only meant to emphasize Leonard's wretchedness) I think we as a civilization have decided that this kind of thing shouldn't be allowed, or at least have some sort of warning label attached to it.<br/><br/>Other than that, this is about the greatest movie in the last five years."

In the movie she often looked bored and unhappy. I mean who reads a book that many times. Apparently she was on drugs and maybe gave him the disease that made him loose his mind. Like Natilie said. They made up some story to get insurance money or just an easy way for her to get away. The cop `Teddy' was in on it from the beginning. He just wanted to use him even more.  Another reason is she was still alive when the bag was zipped up. And not to mention the most obvious one at the end of the movie when he lays with his wife with his tattoos!

","Where do I start with this movie? Everything about this movie rocked  - although I was a little puzzled at the beginning [I kept thinking to myself ""What the hell is going on?!""], and it took me a while to realize that the movie was actually playing backwards - not so that they all walked backwards and talked gibberish, as I think that is the usual misconception, but the scenes weren't played in proper sequence , I am pretty slow]. However, once the plot took off, I settled in for the ride.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Memento is about a man named Leonard Shelby [played by the excellent Guy Pearce], who is impeded on his hunt for revenge on his wife's killers by the loss of short term memory [that in itself already sounds pretty complicated]. On the way, he is joined by others -but it is up to the viewer to decide whether they are friends or foes.<br/><br/>At the very end of the movie, there is a massive twist [of course I won't reveal the ending and ruin it for everyone] which surprised me and had me thinking ""Aha, very cunning!""<br/><br/>Even if you still have doubts on whether you possess enough brain cells in order to understand or enjoy the movie, I suggest that you should go and see it anyway - if you don't understand it, hey never mind, you just get to see Guy Pearce strip down to his boxers - a lot."

","Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" anything but mediocre. It is the most beautiful, poetic, and strangely told thriller I've ever come across. Some people are probably not going to like ""Memento"" because of its overwhelming complexity. But the fact that it is so hard to follow is part of the point. Nolan made an effort to allow an audience to be able to tap into the mind of a person with short-term memory loss and be just as confused as Leonard Shelby, the protagonist with the strange condition. He does this, as everybody knows, by telling the film backwards, though all the clues are laid out for you and characters are introduced to you like you're watching a regular movie. Amazing. And of course, an amazing concept like this calls for equally amazing actors to carry the story. And they more than rise to the occasion. No one could've done a better job than Guy Pearce. He is simply spectacular. As is Joe Pantoliano, who brings a charismatic comic relief to the piece (which is certainly needed). And Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job of changing your perceptions of a character just by adding more facial expressions. This movie is perfect, innovative, and down right awesome! 10/10"

Throughout the whole movie, you're actually trying to get inside Leonard's head and try to feel what he must be going through.  The way that the movie was presented was excellent.  I really liked the idea of the reverse order of events.<br/><br/>I was never a big fan of Guy Pearce before this movie, but after watching his splendid performance, I became really interested in his work.

"peppow","10","0","1","21 May 2002"," When you are only allowed to see or buy one single movie...
","...then, in my opinion, it should be Memento. The way Christpher Nolan tells this story is absolutely unique. I have never, ever, seen anything like it.<br/><br/>
The main story is told backwards i.e. you will see a part that covers the period from 2 pm to 4 pm (not that this is actually the case, time is of no importance in this story, it is just an example used by me in an attempt to clarify the way the movie is put together), after which you will see a part covering 1 pm to 2 pm (or actually 2.10 pm because most of the parts overlap). For this main story color film has been used. These colour sections are separated by parts filmed in black and white film. These black and white parts tell another part of the story in ordinary sequential order.<br/><br/>Because the main story is told backwards the viewer obviously does not know what caused the events to happen. This puts the audience in the same position as the main character who suffers from short-time memory loss. I find the way Christopher Nolan has achieved this effect is very, very clever. I have to admit that during the first parts I felt a slight irritation because this sequence he chose forces the viewer to keep on thinking about what he sees to put it into the right perspective. But when it occurred to me why he did it I was completely grasped by the story.<br/><br/>I hope that we will see many more movies from this very, very promising director."

"Jeremy Bristol","7","0","1","23 February 2002"," The structure
","I've read a lot of reviews of Memento that say the reverse structure shows how it feels to be like Leonard.  After the first scene, it doesn't!  If he has no memory, then he can't backtrack, now can he?  He can't figure out what we end up seeing by the end of the movie.  He would move forward, aimlessly (and once he takes his picture at the beginning and writes out that he's finally done it, then he will no longer have the mystery the ""ending"" of the movie claims he desires).  <br/><br/>There are different types of narrative structures, and they each have their uses and limitations.  Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" is told from an anonymous and distant point of view, because if it was in first person or even third person limited, the story of a town who each year select a victim to be stoned wouldn't be believeable.  Just as that is true, stories like Steinbeck's ""The Chrysanthemums"" need to be closer to the main character but still not in their voice.  Then there are stories, such as Welty's ""Why I Live in the P.O."" which are told by the main character, yet reveals that character's limited perspective and biases.<br/><br/>Perhaps Nolan would have done better to have stuck with a structure that truly stayed with how the character thought, though quite frankly, I don't think it's possible for a movie to truly express that kind of condition, because we are not afflicted and anything shown--forwards or backwards or sideways--will be remembered.  Perhaps he really should have written it in a more omniscient style, showing how the other characters react to him as opposed to the other way around.  After all, with the exception of the forward-moving black and white sequences, he always acted exactly the same (until the speeches at the end), which makes it a little boring and repetetitive to follow him constantly."

","This was the most brilliant movie of 2001 and I am in shock that it didn't get an Oscar nomination. Told completely backwards, director Christopher Nolan takes us on the hunt for a killer as seen through the shattered reality of a man with no memory. Guy Pearce is simply remarkable as Leonard, whose obsessive persuit of the man that kills his wife has consumed his life, and in the wake of his condition it is, in fact, the only thing he is living for. The supporting cast is amazing, the always terrific Joe Pantoliano for one, who just has this knack for playing likable sleaze, and Carrie-Anne Moss, known best for her role in the Matrix films, is also pitch perfect in a Noir film that redefines the genre for the new century. It can be hard to follow if you're not paying attention, but in the end the eccentricity of how the tale is told makes more and more sense as, just like Leonard, you never know how he got to the point where he is. A brilliant, moving film that deserved better from Oscar this year. it's one of my favorite films and i've told just about everyone I know to go ahead and rent it.  Remarkable."

The narrative structure - totally flawless... I could go on - In fact there is not one aspect of this film that I don't like.<br/><br/>I first saw this movie a couple of months ago when I purchased it on DVD and after the first viewing I knew I loved the film but I was not quite sure and since then I must have watched the film ten times (a couple of times with the special feature on the DVD) and each time I see or hear something new that adds to the puzzle and the resolution of it. On the topic of resolution I have searched the web and read a few interesting comments on exactly who Leonard is and who is telling the truth in the movie and Chris Nolan (director) has said all things tie together on close viewing.<br/><br/>For the critics out there, sure there are some holes in the plot; for example, if Leonard cannot remember anything since his attack how can he remember he has a condition? he often states this in the movie without reference to his 'memory aids' and I am sure there are many more 'flaws' but to highlight these is pointless as even the flaws add to the puzzle in this movie, as they force you to think your way through the movie and not just sit a eat popcorn.<br/><br/>Overall this is the best film I have seen in a long time and being a DVD/Movie nut - I have seen a quite a few!

"Steve-684","Null","0","2","17 February 2002"," And you are?...
","A few years back, SEINFELD inflicted upon television one of the worst nadirs in the medium's volatile history: the backwards episode.  Stephen King used to intimate for purposes of jocularity that he might be able to get away with publishing his shopping list- or some such mundane, domestic record anyway- due to his immense fame and brand inculcation; he of course would never be so arrogant (one of the Monkees- Nesmith, I believe- said a similar thing, only this time it was recording the banal standard of ""Happy Birthday [interestingly enough, the Beatles essentially accomplished such a feat]). No one would ever try to publish their shopping list, but that's exactly what Jerry et al. did by synthesizing an episode where, get this, instead of setup/punchline, let's do- are you ready for this, gang?- punchline/setup! That's right, let's do it backwards!  Instead of starting at the beginning, let's start at the end!  Instead of reading left to right, let's go right to left!  The audience will love us, we're practically Gods by now in their eyes, we can get away with anything!  This particular lapse into experimental episodic theater met with questionable justification and perhaps challenged too harshly the faithful flock into assimilating a hook which was too sharp-edged for the typical viewer; or, to be more colloquial, it sucked.<br/><br/>I had this show in the back of my mind when approaching MEMENTO.  Would it essentially be a bad Seinfeld episode, I wondered.  I was really worried while viewing the opening scene, which literally was celluloid run in the unorthodox polarity.  I braced myself for the experience, determined to give the sucker a well-deserved chance, for I had heard such laudatory comment about it.<br/><br/>What I discovered in MEMENTO was perhaps a pinnacle of achievement.  Could it be genius, the inspired kind?  Or, maybe, proactively divined from the center of the human mind?  I have no idea.  Suffice to say it is a rare beast: an experimental film which actually yields practical results.  Mark the genus, the species, capture a specimen, place it in a menagerie, and study it so that we might learn how to  raise more of it.<br/><br/>The engine of the film was nothing less than off-the-wall quirky: run the plot from finish to start.  Keep the scenes themselves in proper format, but change their locations on the sequence.  This would be stupid, of course, if there wasn't a good enough reason for it; I mean, you don't want to run a work backwards just for the sake of running it backwards, do you Mr. Seinfeld?  Gratuity was defeated by this: the main character can not hold memories for any significant length of time.  And as a character in the film stated: it's like living in reverse.  At first I didn't really get the concept, but then it became as clear as a protozoan cell: run the scenes backward, and the viewer immediately empathizes with the sufferer.  Talk about being disjointed!  I certainly was, and that's what I needed to be. I needed to figure the mystery out along with the main character.  The plot certainly could have been done in a conventional way, but then the viewer's omniscient awareness would have rendered the project a useless exercise in typical made-for-premium cable banality.  And if you think it's impossible to inject twists and contortions and red herrings into a movie where you see the ending first, I will ask you to think twice, you can count on it.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes, this is a science fiction film, one theoretically based on a Philip K. Dick tale (Dick would have loved this). TOTAL RECALL is one of the most clever films to ever be recorded, but it is not really open to interpretation due to a certain scene in it; MEMENTO, on the other hand, is one for which many possibilities are equally plausibleit is a chaotic system to be sure, and it invites the watcher to elucidate his/her own equations in the interest of resolving and replicating the fractal nature within.<br/><br/>No thing is perfect, certainly, and the one glaring question I have- unless this was accounted for within the story and I missed it anyway- was why the main character didn't make use of audio/video recording devices.  But I suppose it is easily explained away.  The point is, I enjoyed the film, and maybe you will as well"

","Last night, I saw Memento (after hearing how good it was from about ten different people).  To be honest, it was a little disappointing.  Although the story was interesting and, without a doubt, unique, the fact that they played the story out backwards, and expected the viewer to draw a conclusion about the motives or qualities of any of the characters was a bit to ask. I would have preferred that they developed individual story lines in larger blocks, as opposed to jumping between time periods, non-descript hotel rooms, and replaying scenes over again as if to remind the watcher what had happened.  Even now as I try to put my thoughts into words, the very nature of the movie makes that difficult.  It's perhaps something I need to see again, just to attain any understanding about it.  All in all, not bad, but definitely not one of my favorites."

","Memento is one of those films you cannot just see once.  It's narrative structure and oblique, but well thought out plot are so labyrinthine and so compelling that you have to go back.  If only to figure out if you figured it out right the first time you saw it.<br/><br/>The plot concerns a man who has suffered a brain injury that results in him not being able to form new memories.  Consequently he goes through life in cycles of wondering where he is and how he got there.  He can't remember new people.  The last memory he has is of his wife being raped and murdered. This and the fact he doesn't have anything else to lose have spurred him on to find his wife's killer and seek bloody revenge.  He overcomes his handicap with the use of copious notes and polaroid photos to substitute for his missing memory.  For the really important stuff, only tattoos will do.<br/><br/>This is complex enough.  Added to that however is that the director has edited the action so the narrative proceed backwards, from Larry killing his wife's killer back through the events leading up to this moment.  You may need to take a notepad into the cinema yourself just to keep up.<br/><br/>This film fits into the category of ""wow, that was good, what exactly happened again?"" into which you can fit the Usual Suspects and most of the work of David Lynch.  It's one of those films that require thinking about. You are a detective sifting through your memories of the film to find solid facts to grip hold of in order to make sense of it.  The truth is very slippery though...<br/><br/>Guy Pearce as Larry is excellent.  How he prepared for this role I do not know.  His motivation at any given instant is confused to say the least. What does a person do when he finds a note written to himself from one of his past cycles of forgetfulness urging him to do something homicidal?  That he portrays this character very believeably is an achievement in itself.  He draws you into the character and makes him sympathetic despite being confused and driven to revenge.  You want to work out what this man is thinking.  Pearce lets you into Lenny's mind with an acting performance that should have merited and Oscar nomination at least.<br/><br/>I'm not convinced that this film is as good as it could have been, but it's pretty damn close.  It ended when I wasn't expecting it to, and thus left to ponder what resolution there had been instead of providing an easy resolution on the screen.  That isn't a bad thing at all, but it did leave me with a big sense that something was missing.<br/><br/>Please go and see this film, if only for the sheer novelty of the plot and the attempt to break the narrative conventions of cinema in such an interesting way."

This movie is told backwards,(like that old Seinfeld episode)and the story-telling is so original and inventive that the plot, and plot twists, only work once. That's right, no sequels for Memento. This may upset some, but I am glad that this story will remain untouched and unspoiled. Give it up for Christopher Nolan, the writer/director for stumbling upon such a great gimmick.

","When i read that ""Memento"" got a high score on the IMDB top 250, i decided to rent the DVD at Blockbuster. The idea of telling the story backwards is fine but is not a true novelty. In some ways was used since the first movies developed on Agatha Christie's mysteries, when the detectives, after investigating, explained how things happened to the audience and the idea has been used several times in other thriller movies i've seen, even though not so extensively as in ""Memento"". After the first 30 minutes i thought that it was going to be one of those surprising movies like ""The Sixth Sense"", but then i got a bit bored with its routine. I am not totally disappointed, but the movie left me in some ways unsatisfied, like a good meal that hasn't been cooked enough.<br/><br/>To be seen twice, then forget it. My rating:72%"

","WARNING: SPOILERS INSIDE!<br/><br/>Memento is a wonderfully structured and brilliantly executed motion picture, a thought-provoking masterpiece, and one of the most imaginative films of all time.<br/><br/>Almost.<br/><br/>The less than perfect finish tarnishes the whole product. And it's not the wrapping up of the story that is weak, it's the way it is executed that contradicts all the film's cinematic highlights that came before. It is one of the most fundamental errors in filmmaking, and therefore all the more prominent: Exposition through dialogue.<br/><br/>The whole denoument is two monologues, one by 'Terry' and one in voice-over by Leonard, the main character. Why? Was there no other way to expose the ending? The filmmaker exposes his filmic craftsmanship regularly in this picture, then seems to have used it all up when he got to the ending. Such a shame, because now the film brings a strong feeling of 'what it might have been'. And this review would have ended with the first paragraph.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, we are still left with a very good film. The juxtaposition of past, present and future is brilliantly conceived and executed. This is not the sort of film that can be used as 'background noise', attention is necessary at all times. But when attention is paid, the complex structure is easy to follow, and therefore all the more rewarding.<br/><br/>The same brilliance that brought the structure itself to fruition, surfaces in particular scenes. Stand out is Carrie-Anne Moss' devilish character exploiting the main charachter's weakness with a ferocity and cunning that makes the blood run colder than many a horror movie ever can. This scene by itself almost redeems the flawed ending.<br/><br/>Almost."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Wow, Memento is without a doubt my favourite movie of all time. If viewed the right way as you can on the region 2 DVD (or should that be the wrong way) the film is just average. Where this film really becomes special is the way that it is edited. The film is completely backwards starting with a murder and backtracking to show why this person was killed.<br/><br/>For someone who used to be in neighbours Guy Pearce is a great actor and he gives a fantastic performance as Leornard. Not that the other actors aren't excellent too. The film seems confusing for the first 20 minutes or so until you get used to the way it works, but after that you will be completely hooked until the surprising ending. How they managed to film such a complicated movie in just over three weeks is astounding but proves why Christopher Nolan is a director to watch. I urge everyone to see this film and if you have seen it i bet you have watched it more than once."

I could narrate the entire movie to somebody and still wouldn't be spoiling anything for them!! The most amazing part is that there are no major loopholes in this movie.

This way of clipping makes you feel a little lost, exactly as the main character. It's a brilliant piece of movie making, but if you're going to watch it, make sure you give it your full attention.

","Imagine what life would be like if you had no short-term memory.  You meet someone, introduce yourself, and have a conversation.  Ten minutes into that conversation you realize you don't remember meeting this person, or any of what you just talked about.  This is the life of Leonard Shelby in MEMENTO. He's a tortured man living in a life without a set direction.  Only through a system of writing himself notes on photos, and tattooing special information on his body, can he make it day by day.  He knows that his wife was raped and murdered.  He remembers everything up until that day... or does he?  Now he wants only to find the man responsible, and exact the harshest form of justice.  Along the way he's made a couple of friends. Teddy, played by the always engaging Joe Pantoliano, is a confident but shady pal who seems to know a lot more than he lets on.  Then there's Natalie, played mysteriously by Carrie-Anne Moss.  She seems trustworthy, but may have her own secret agenda.  Between these two, Leonard doesn't quite know who to trust, or more importantly how much he's already trusted them.  His one saving grace comes in the form of a tattoo on his hand that reads ""Sammy Jankis"", which is in reference to a man Leonard met some time ago who suffered the same condition.  You'll snicker at the way certain people take advantage of Leonard's problem, only to find those actions become more disturbing and very extreme as the story rewinds.  The worst part is that he can do nothing about it.  MEMENTO is a twisting tale told literally backwards.  The first scene in the film is the last thing to happen.  Our job as the audience is to slowly step back in time to uncover just how exactly all of this came about.  There has been quite a bit of buzz about this movie from numerous film festivals around the world.  It's interesting to see how a movie can take such a dramatic step against the norm, and still find new ways to keep you guessing.  Guy Pearce, who many of you may remember from L.A. CONFIDENTIAL a couple years back, plays the confused yet highly motivated role of Leonard very well.  We feel for him, but wonder just how sane he could be with his condition.  The film gets a tad longwinded in some scenes.  Overall it's a cinematic experience that has to be seen to be fully understood.  The best part about MEMENTO is the fact that what you take away from it will most likely be unique to you.  This is not a film for everyone.  It seemed that most of the ""older"" people didn't care for it.  I distinctly heard one gentleman tell the poll-taker that he thought it was a ""Poor"" movie.  Others seemed almost giddy with a sense of awe.  Some films are more cerebral than others.  If you decide to see this, be prepared to think hard about it, both during and after.<br/><br/>On a scale of ONE to TEN, TEN being the best, I give MEMENTO a SEVEN"

","Before I rented this movie a couple of days ago I had hardly heard anything about it. Imagine my surprise when I realised that this was one of the best films of 2001!It was both smart and suspenseful at the same time. A true surprise.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this film so great is not the acting or even the basic story line. (We have seen films about amnesia before.) It´s the anti-linear story telling. (Thank god that they didn´t rip of Altman for this one!) The story unravels a bit like an reallife crimeinvestigation and ends up in an truly surprising ending. Sometimes you get the feeling that logic doesn´t really hold up for closer scrutiny but that´s just a minor glitch in the framwork of an minor masterpiece.<br/><br/>I wan´t to point out that had the film not had such an exciting ending this would just have been an interesting experiment, but now it turns out to be a great film that proves that american cinema is alive and kicking.<br/><br/>Good stuff."

","Many many spoilers!<br/><br/>I am still thinking about this movie months later.  It is the most original, mind-bending movie I've seen since Clockwork Orange or the Usual Suspects. I saw this movie simply because I liked Guy Pierce in LA Confidential.  I knew nothing about the plot or style beforehand, and I think that is the best way to initially view this film. (If you haven't seen it yet, stop reading and watch it...NOW!)  I saw it in the late afternoon in a theater with four other people, none of whom I knew.  This movie captivated me from the very beginning.  I loved how it started with something that every one of us has done; developing a Polaroid picture by waving it back and forth. It quickly progresses to an action that (hopefully) very few of us have done; murder.  I had no clue that it was backwards, so I was surprised that someone would be killed in the first five minutes.  As the movie progressed, I kept thinking of various explanations of what was going on.  I usually observe movies and think about them later, but Memento is so captivating and has such a creative style that it is impossible not to come up with motives and theories for what is happening.  It was like riding a roller coaster backwards and blindfolded. I thought I knew what was going on, but by the end I was so amazed and dumbfounded that I didn't know what to think. Memento is so great because of the director's style.  I felt as lost and confused as Lenard, because I didn't know what had just happened.  All of the characters knew, except for Lenard, but they didn't want to tell us. Although the movie is confusing, it is not difficult to follow and all the components are tied together very well.  One other thing that surprised me is that this movie is very funny in a morbid sort of way, especially the parts with Dodd and the hotel room.  This is a great movie, one for the ages.  My vote for Best Picture."

","I have seen alot of movies in my life. I've seen just about all of the 'classics' (""Citizen Kane"", ""Gone With The Wind"", ""Casablanca"", ""Psycho"", ""The Godfather"", ""2001 : A Space Odyssey"" etc. etc.). I've seen almost every single movie that has ever gotten a Best Picture Oscar, along with a seemingly endless amount of obscure, but great, movies.<br/><br/>This is my favorite movie of all time. I never thought I would see a movie that would come out this recently that would make me say that. This movie is truly, truly brilliant.<br/><br/>When it comes to movies, I am very critical. I don't just automatically say ""Oh, I'd give that movie an eight or a nine"". For me, a really good movie gets about a seven. If it is exceptionally good, eight. I gave ""Memento"" a perfect 10. This is a perfect movie.<br/><br/>I won't bother going into explaining the plot - you can read that anywhere. What I wanted to stress here is that this movie is so perfectly timeless. It will never be outdated. Better yet, it will also never be boring to talk about. There is such a large amount of psychology involved in this movie that it is impossible to catch it all by watching it once. Also, for that matter, ""Memento"" manages to take on different meanings when watched from the end to the beginning (which is proper chronological order). Suddenly lines that you didn't even think of as being significant are extremely crucial. So, to watch it once is to deny yourself of a large part of the movie.<br/><br/>That's because ""Memento"" isn't just a movie. It's a puzzle. You are required as the audience to fully realize what was just shown to you. You will be told about 80% of it by the movie (though not always in an obvious way) - but there will be some pieces that you will have to think about and realize afterwards. Of course this isn't the first movie to ever be like that, but ""Memento"" stretches the limits.<br/><br/>Also, every scene in ""Memento"" is essential to the grand scheme of things. If any of the scenes were left out, it would leave a hole in the plot.<br/><br/>I have heard the backwards storyline of ""Memento"" described as ""gimmicky"". However, if you truly understand the main character's condition, you realize that it is the perfect way to take the audience into his mind.<br/><br/>It's been almost a year since I first saw this movie, and I still find myself discovering tiny little facts that just make the movie even MORE interesting. When you have seen a movie about ten or fifteen times, rate it as being a ""10"", call it your ""favorite of all time"", and can STILL discover new interesting things about it almost a year later, then it is safe to call that movie brilliant."

"Jamalio","Null","0","1","24 January 2002"," HARD TO FORGET
","This is an inventive spin on the film noir genre. The character is set in a world of dark uncertainty where no one can be trusted because he cannot remember who the hell they were to begin with. All the characters who you believe are trustworthy are deceptive, and all the characters who aren't trustworthy might be, although you never get to find out. The narrative itself is layed out in the style of Leanords' thinking patterns, so the audience gets to understand and empathise with his condition. There is also a touching subtext about identifying with yourself by looking in the mirror and remembering what you've accomplished, in trusting others by remembering if they've hurt your feelings or have helped you out in some way, by knowing and understanding the past with written literature (his notes/tatoos), gaining emotional feelings like guilt and happiness with the passing of time through memories, and being told the things you want to be told and remembering what you want to remember, rather than hearing  (and remembering) the truth. The fact that writer/director Chris Nolan manages to fit all these aesthetics into the films' running time with a narrative that is completely unique is quite an accomplishment. The narrative itself isn't actually ground breaking- it's a style which suits the film's concept perfectly and may therefore only influence films which have a similar theme (to adopt this style of narrative to a film that has nothing to do with these themes would be completely pointless). A film that once seen will never be forgotten 9/10."

","Inventive, unique, engaging film about a man with short-term memory loss trying to piece together and avenge his wife's rape and murder.  Told backwards, this film makes us feel the confusion, delusion, and frustration of the main character (Guy Pearce) as he tries to determine who he can trust and where to go next.  Pearce is on screen for every scene, and he delivers a strong performance, both chilling and inspirational at the same time. Director Nolan also hits us with a subliminal message about the ultimate futility of revenge and the human desire to make sense of the world around us.  In the end, this film's creative style and backwards motion carry it high above an otherwise everyday noir plot.  Never loses its focus and keeps you thinking well after the credits role-for better or worse."

I think if you go into it not knowing the backwards/forwards method of storytelling, it may take longer to figure out what's going on. Since we watched it on video, we could rewind it a few times just to review what we just saw, and make sure we were catching all the details.

","This is a film which starts you from the beginning and sends you backward learning little by little about where you came from. <br/><br/>Guy Pearce is the man named Lenny who can remember his wife being murdered but can't remember anything after that.He has short term memory loss and can't remember what happens from one moment to the next. Which is why he makes so many notes. He does have alot of police notes to help him find the killer and everytime he gets another clue or fact, he has to write it down immediately or he will forget it. No only does he write BUT just to make sure he doesn't lose his important notes, he gets them tatooed on all over his body. The story, with the way it is presented, is some what confusing, as it would be for Lenny. Who can he trust and are people who they seem they are? <br/><br/>The idea of filming a story beginning with the end and ending with the beginning isn't new. It was done before on a TV show called ""thirtysomething"". The episode was about Gary and his wife, Susannah, having their baby. It started off just before the birth then went backwards to the starting of child birthing classes. It was a good idea but in Memento, it is put to great use and helps you understand the story and the character more. If you are thinking about seeing this, don't think, WATCH IT.

","1st thing I've got to say is I'm a sucker for movies that are different than the typical movie.  Most movies have recycled cliches and steal things from other movies that have been done previously.<br/><br/>Memento is unique in that it tells a large part of its story backwards.  The main character, Leonard Shelby, has no short term memory, but despite that is trying to track down his wife's killer.<br/><br/>Momento confuses you at times since it jumps right into scenes that you have no idea as to how he got to that point.  But as the movie moves backwards, things start making more sense and it actually can keep you in some suspense.<br/><br/>Momento isn't the normal straight-forward entertaining movie, and it will make you think.

You start aimlessly playing Solitaire, or maybe Minesweeper, letting your mind freely roam both the landscape of the movie, and your response.<br/><br/>
As you sit there, you begin to realize a disturbing thing: the plot is not all that interesting. This is not to say that the movie isn't interesting, or that it doesn't hold your attention.

The story is told in both chronological (B&W) and backwards (colour) order with these two meeting at the end of the film. The viewer is able to empathize with Leonards condition because although we start the film at the end of the chronological order of events we do not know what has preceded. The story unfolds as we see the preceding situations. This film is to be watched more than once and, just like Fight Club, you will spot things early in the film you would have missed first viewing. This film had me thinking about it days (well weeks) after seeing it, and any film that achieves that can't be bad!<br/><br/>**SPOILERS** After countless viewings there is still a sense of ambiguity of what actually happened and because we are seeing essentially the same way as the protagonist we may never know.

","(PLENTY OF SPOILERS)<br/><br/>Memento was a neat trick, which I found to be engrossing throughout. Whether or not it was a ""gimmick,"" I thought the gimmick added something, and did partially simulate the character's experience for the viewer; every scene unfolds without any knowledge of the scene before it, meaning you always start disoriented and need to rely on the character's notes to figure out what is going on.<br/><br/>In many ways, it is just a clever way of telling a detective story; detectives try to recreate what happened in the past, and this movie takes it the next step and simply tells the story backwards. Unlike the Blair Witch Project, in this movie the gimmick helped absorb me in the story.<br/><br/>However, the movie has a fatal flaw in my view, which is that it seems to take place in a kind of inexplicable moral vacuum, which prevents any serious identification with (or even belief in) the characters. It is not only cold, as many have noted, but positively barren in terms of anyone in the movie having any normal concern over human life. Leonard is not presented as someone who has any background which would lead him to serial killing, and yet that is what he does, and no one even questions him for a moment, as if bloody revenge is just something that everyone talks about over coffee. The movie takes at face value Leonard's conclusion that murder is the only, best, and most natural way for him to heal.<br/><br/>Leonard believes the world will be a better place if his wife's death is avenged, even if he has no satisfaction in knowing that it happened. At any point, he could simply choose to forget, but the fantasy of revenge gives his life purpose. Fine, I can sort of accept that. But no one challenges him; no one questions him; in fact, people use him to carry out their own dirty business. I realize there are bad people in the world and all that, and I have enjoyed a great many movies about them. However, in this movie, there is not a single person who acts honestly; no one fails to take advantage of Leonard, and no one challenges Leonard's fundamental mission, even as they are fully aware he could kill an innocent more easily than his man (which, in the end, it appears that he has).<br/><br/>It's like a world where honesty and loyalty have never existed, and, since it's neither sci-fi nor a movie about low-lifes or criminals, that makes it a hard world to take seriously. It would have made more sense to me if he were a cop or something, but instead he is a mild-mannered insurance adjuster who really knows his way around with a gun and has no problem assaulting people with tire irons.<br/><br/>But let's say, whatever, he got really messed up by his wife's assault, is hell-bent on revenge, and even though he could choose to forget, he doesn't want to. Ok. But then, if the end of the movie is to be believed, (BIG SPOILERS), it appears that he has already had his vengeance, and after ALL of his meticulous notes that he keeps for EVERYTHING, it would appear he chose to forget about it, invalidating what for him is the single most important event in the world, the thing that makes his breadcrumbs in time worth creating.<br/><br/>But THEN, even better, he makes the conscious decision to forget, again, and choose not just an arbitrary target but someone he knows has helped him, just so that his life has meaning. It's a great one-two sucker punch for the audience, but it makes no sense. He makes a conscious decision that the lives of others (his friends even), *and his wife's assault and death,* are less important than his need to have a mystery to solve. So in the end, he just winds up being truly pathological, which is not really that interesting; he was much more interesting as a wounded man with a mysterious and disabling condition he must push past in order to heal his wounds (if dubiously) and right his wrongs.<br/><br/>(Some have pointed out the ""I did it"" tattoo in a scene with his wife; I missed this, but since it doesn't appear elsewhere in the movie, it seems like it may have only been part of the weird impressionism of the scene, and not really there; and if he had it removed somehow, then he's even more pathological than I imagined.)<br/><br/>Even his wife's/Sammy's wife suicide by taking advantage of the condition demonstrates a curious lack of humanity -- before ever consulting a doctor or psychologist, she finally chooses to take her own life by allowing their loved one to kill them via a cruel test. Who does this? Again, it is as if, in the world of the movie, people just don't think about life and death in the same way the rest of us do.<br/><br/>And the thing is, a movie is completely entitled to have that perspective -- but it doesn't serve this one very well. This movie is a murder mystery with a main character you have to be sympathetic toward in order to make it through the film, in order to make his journey yours, as well a meditation on the nature of memory. However, the life-indifferent perspective makes it hard to identify, and clouds the discussion on memory. It just gets in the way.<br/><br/>So, in the end, great idea, fine acting, entertaining execution, good brain candy, worth watching for sure, but ultimately hobbled by a serious lack of believability of the motivations of the characters due to an unexplainable indifference to human life and emotion, demonstrated by every character in the movie. It kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth in the end."

","For all of us movie fans who grow tired of the same old shoot-em-up, blow everything to hell movies, but don't want to settle for boring melodramatic artistic films, the perfect compromise can be found in Memento.<br/><br/>Memento stars Guy Pearce, who was awesome in LA Confidential and is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood.  It is the story of a man, Lenny, who has lost the ability to make new memories.  This unusual medical condition, short-term memory loss, was obtained on the night of Lenny's wife's rape and murder when he attempted to save her from her attackers. The camera follows as Lenny attempts to track down his wife's killer using a very organized system of notes and polaroid photographs, and a few seemingly helpful persons.  If Lenny needs to remember something, such as where his hotel is located, or who someone is, he takes a picture and writes notes on the back.  This system is quite effective, but does not aid Lenny's ability to distinguish the time events occur, or specific details related to particular people.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Lenny killing a man in what appears to be a revenge killing.  Soon we realize that this is the end of the film, and that the movie will work backwards as many movies do.  However, this film is quite different.  Instead of giving large portions of the story at once, it tells the story as though the viewer is Lenny himself, providing the events as a person with no short term memory would perceive them; very short and choppy. While this is going on, the director also implements the use of black and white film to incorporate  the opposite end of the plot.  In the end, the two come together to form a conclusion that made me press rewind and watch the movie two more times the same day.<br/><br/>Hands down, this is the best film of the year, in any genre.  Regardless of what type of movies you watch, what actors you like, or whatever, you will find yourself loving every second of this movie (if the choppy, fast paced plot doesn't p*** you off first).  If you have not watched this film, you are really missing an all together amazing movie accomplishment.<br/><br/>10/10"

"jrm-3","10","0","1","9 January 2002"," Comment on some of the Negative Comments
","I've read through many of the comments on IMDB for ""Memento,"" and I was surprised at how many of them focused on the ""top 10"" argument.  (As in, ""This is a good movie but it shouldn't be in the top 10 of all time."") Well, obviously enough people have voted on this movie at imdb to place it in the top 10, so the whole argument is over.  Done.  Move on!<br/><br/>Secondly, some of the ""holes"" that people have pointed out can either be explained or are, in my opinion, intentionally unexplainable.  For example, the whole ""if he REALLY had no short term memory, then he wouldn't remember that he had no short term memory"" discussion.  Was I the only one that noticed that this argument was the whole point of the movie? <br/><br/>SPOILERS!!! I mean, when the film ends and Lenny's memories are brought into question--did his wife really die?  Did he already kill John G?  Was he really Sammy Jenkins?--then I began to wonder if he even really had a memory problem to begin with.  After all, everyone doubted Sammy's memory problems, even Lenny.  In fact, Lenny says to Sammy's wife that Sammy should be able to make new memories.  But HE's Sammy...  It's like his subconscious is trying to tell him that if he really wanted to, he'd be able to make new memories without a problem.  He just doesn't really want to... he's stuck in a world of depression and guilt over what happened.  That's why every once in a while he remembers things that he probably shouldn't have (like the gun in the drawer...knowing the car that Teddy drove so he could write down the license plate number... etc)  <br/><br/>Then again, that interpretation could be totally false, too. There's no definitive answer... the movie is built to make you discuss and question everything you've seen.  The BEST thing about Memento is that it DOESN""T explain everything away (a la Vanilla Sky).  It trusts the audience to form its own opinions through intelligent discussions..."

But I have a few brand new questions now, and also a few new clues (I think):<br/><br/>1) The story is not told entirely backwards. The b/w is forward, starting quite early in the story, the coloured scenes are backward. Those two plots 'meet' in the end. Therefore (I just saw that in another comment) it is correct that Leonard burns the picture of himself, he received it in the b/w story, thus earlier.<br/><br/>2) However, at the end of the movie he also writes a note:<br/><br/>Tattoo Fact 6 - License No.....xxx Throughout the movie he sometimes watches his own tattoos in awe, as he has not seen them before. How can he remember then that this is fact number 6???<br/><br/>3) Unfortunately I did not notice but my boyfriend says that in the scene where Sammy is shown in this institution, after the death of his wife, for an instant it is actually Leonard sitting in his chair.<br/><br/>4) I think Teddy and Natalie had a deal to use Lenny to get rid of Dodd and Jimmy and get themselves a nice bit of money. However at some point Natalie decides she wants to get rid of Teddy too (to have the money to herself? to make sure there are no witnesses?), this is why she gives Leonard a copy of Teddy's drivers license.<br/><br/>I love discussing this movie! There are so many different little things.... definitely my all time favourite!"

","Strange how this gets a release in the UK before the USA. Perhaps that's the point - the film starts at the end and finishes at the beginning, so why not the release dates? Memento is a clever, and compelling film that keeps you guessing throughout, still full of tension and intrigue, despite its peculiar structure, it manages to maintain your interest, but could perhaps be a little clever for its own good for some viewers. But if cerebral movies are your thing, then it's well worth checking out, plus the photography and direction is excellent, and Guy Pierce proves once again what a convincing actor he can be. What makes Memento stand out though is that it doesn't appear to take itself too seriously and get bogged down - it maintains a good sense of black humor throughout - and though it's quite hard on the brain cells, and you may wonder how it's all feasible, the very idea behind it is interesting enough to make the film work very well."

Everything before that day is clear (his name, his job, how to drive, etc.) but talk to him too long and he won't remember being introduced to you.  Leonard (and the viewers) must piece together clues from photographs, notes in his handwriting, and tattoos on his body, to understand all that has happened to him.  The director feeds all these pieces to you in reverse order... the same way that Leonard would have to work his way backwards through each clue, not even remembering when he left himself the clue.<br/><br/>A very interesting ""who done it"" that spirals you through the life and mind of one man's shattered world."

","Memento is a good movie in my opinion. Sure it's not the one of the greatest (like a Cary Grant movie) but its still good.<br/><br/>These days pretty much every idea for a movie has already been taken. I mean there are millions of movies out there. So of course you're going to see movies play off of each other all the time. I'm sure Memento can be found in many movies that have come before it but I didn't find it to be some horrible, cheap imitation and repetitious.<br/><br/>Some people complain that this movie was too confusing and that there were too many plot holes.<br/><br/>The whole genesis of this movie and what makes it different from most that I've watched lately is you have to get inside this movie. You can't just view it from the surface only giving half you attention to it or it defiantly won't make sense. This means you may even have to watch it more than once but trust me it all comes together.<br/><br/>Now if you don't like having to play detective while you watch a movie I wouldn't suggest it but never the less it's a good movie.<br/><br/>And as for the plot holesI don't pay any attention to them. I rather enjoy a movie then analyze everything that's wrong with it.  I do have to agree that its probably not top ten material because I'm positive there's ten other movies that overrate it but I believe it rates up there somewhere."
"rzajac","10","0","1","2 January 2002"," metaphor for spiritual blindness
","I had just read _Mere Christianity_ (C.S. Lewis) before seeing Memento and, between the two of them, it was a one-two knockout.<br/><br/>I suppose I shouldn't be admitting this, but the movie convicted me of my own blindness.  I feel it explains the problem of evil in a way that David Lynch--for all his facility in constructing those clever, creepy little inbred tautologies of evil--could not.  Leonard's plight is our plight; running around creating havoc without meaning to, and for the same reason; because our sphere of perception is crimped.  But there is a silver lining to this dark cloud.  Whereas Leonard will probably never get a resolution to this root problem (will never ""heal""), we can get a resolution to the problem of spiritual blindness; we can ""heal.""  It's a struggle, but one that's worth the effort.  And I encourage all readers who are aware that they're struggling with their spiritual ""Leonardness""--they're cuss'd tendency to forget they ever cared to grow in faith, hope and charity--to continue the fight; think of all the Leonards who don't know they're Leonards.  Keep up that good fight.<br/><br/>I found myself explaining the attraction of the film to a friend in the following way:  It doesn't discourage the U.S viewer from engaging on the usual level; you start picking out the white hats and black hats and prepare for the usual, cozy, process of watching your moral expectations achieve fulfillment, albeit with some twists and turns.  A lot of what passes for inventiveness or innovation in movie narrative has its locus in these twists and turns.  But ultimately everything works out, right?  But the disappointment of this standard ""parse"" in Memento is profound, if not downright outrageous.  But I like to think the movie succeeds, in perhaps the same manner as a magician's levitation act.  After the magician knocks out the supports, the ""lovely assistant"" is still floating.  I like to think that what remains ""floating"" in this movie--after the supports have been knocked out--feels just as magical to the viewer as the denouement of the magician's act.  The ultimate moral to this movie has the best set of legs I think I've _ever_ seen; and they're all the more marvelous for the fact that one reads them off the retinal afterimage of the explosion of one's expectations.<br/><br/>All this, and the fact that it has to be one of the most simply gorgeous movies I've ever seen.  And the fact that, yeah, one is constantly on the edge of one's seat waiting for the next moment that one's jaw hits the floor.  I don't want to leave you with the impression that the movie doesn't deliver any of the standard ""goods;"" it does, in spades.  It's just that the ""dark"" anti-heroic aspect is more than made up for in an overarching theme with cosmic implications that are inspiring and directly applicable to your own life; a rare thing in film, wot?"

The backside to this kind of storytelling is that at the end  af the movie, it gets a bit frustrating to see the same clips over and over again.<br/><br/>If you have trouble understanding the movie there are some very short clips in the last minute of the movie. If you don't understand the movie I will advice you to watch the last 5 minutes of the movie a couple of times. :-) The way the story is cut up and told in ""random order"" is not a new invention and is much better done in movies such as Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>

","I love experimental films.  But, experimental films often fail to engage because the experiment overwhelms the story or there is no real story to tell.  Timecode is a good example of an experiment that failed.  Memento, on the other hand, is an experiment that succeeds brilliantly.  As you can tell within the first few minutes of the film, this movie tells the story in reverse.  It's almost like they took a conventional movie, cut it into scenes, and played the scenes in reverse order.  This works because you are seeing the world from the eyes of someone who has no short term memory.  As such, this could have been a gimmik.  Instead, it's a tool for telling a complex and fascinating story.  I found myself re-watching many scenes to figure out what had happened and what I had missed, only adding to the experience of the film.  <br/><br/>Beware, if you are a lazy, don't bother.

"sdogpdx","8","0","1","28 December 2001"," Good, but not great (***Spoilers below***)
","In general, I liked this movie.  The idea of a continually lapsing short-term memory was a good one, and I'm surprised it hasn't been explored to this extent before.  I also thought the acting was good, although beyond Leonard, the characters were really one-dimensional.  The sequencing was actually done quite well, considering the challenge of showing the plot backwards, and what I thought would be utterly confusing turned out to be quite exciting.<br/><br/>Despite the novelty and cleverness of the writing, the movie does have a few major problems.  First, a person with total short-term memory loss would not be able to remember that he or she has such a condition in the first place. I was happy to see that another reviewer pointed this out.  Unless Leonard had a tattoo explaining his injury and all of the circumstances (to which he referred constantly), it seems like he would always reset and end up believing he was at that very moment after his wife was ""killed"".<br/><br/>Second, the end of the movie was really more confusing than elucidating, and did very little to help the plot.  I understand that this was the producers' intent (to leave us with a feeling of uncertainty about Leonard's life, since that is what he faces throughout the film), but I think it could have been written much better.  I like to leave a movie with a feeling of satisfaction that I understood what the producer(s) wanted, whether it be resolution or purposeful uncertainty.  In this case, I still don't know if it the confusion was written in the script, or was just a mistake.<br/><br/>Third, the movie hinted at some philosophical purpose, but never really got to that point.  Rather than examining what makes us human and whether our memories are actually our identity, the writers used the loss of memory as a novel storytelling tool.  I disagree with those reviewers who claim this was some great philosophical work of art--it may have made you think about it, but offered very little to the debate.<br/><br/>Last on my list of complaints are the loose ends.  What happened to the woman?  Why wasn't anyone chasing Leonard (besides Teddy) if he was a murderer and had a bunch of money?  Why didn't anyone from his old insurance firm ever talk to him?<br/><br/>Overall, this was a fun film, and there were many little nuances that made it very interesting.  I really don't care if the IMDB reviewers give it a 10--that's up to them.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, though, because it is captivating and done quite well."

********  SPOILERS  ***** ***ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM****<br/><br/>
Ever heard of false memories? Even Lenny in the film points out that memories can't always be relied on. That's why there can be 2 different guys in the bathroom- because it's Lenny's memories, and they can change, if Lenny gets it into his head that it was a certain person- e.g. Teddy. The story of Sammy Jenkins, which was in black and white, is NOT TRUE. Didn't you get it? NOBODY MURDERED LENNY'S WIFE. A guy who broke into the house and raped her and struck Lenny to the ground, which caused his memory defect, was probably really already dead as Teddy said. Of course, you might choose to believe that Teddy was lying that time, too (as he does often, anyway), but I think it was true (and why would Teddy lie about it, since he had nothing to gain by this?) - since we see a picture of Lenny lying in bed with his wife, with I'VE DONE IT tattooed on his chest: SHE WAS STILL ALIVE AFTER HE LOST HIS ABILITY TO REMEMBER, and he had killed the guy; but he was only shortly happy because of his revenge (which the picture Teddy took showed) and then he simply forgot. The story of Sammy is so important because IT IS ACTUALLY THE TRUE STORY OF LENNY AND HIS WIFE. She died of too many insulin shots as he described, but he didn't want to remember it. Haven't you ever heard that people repress some memories, that they stay in the subconsciousness, but pop up in an unexpected way? He preferred to believe there was still a bad guy somewhere who was responsible for everything- and looking for him in order to kill him would give his life a meaning. That's what the ending is about. So when Teddy told him the truth (as I believe), Lenny decided to make Teddy his bad guy. That's why he copied his license plate number and had it tattooed, and wrote ""Don't believe his lies"". Why not? After all, he did lie to him and used him to kill Jimmy. Natalie lied and used him, too, to get rid of Dodd (who would otherwise threaten her or maybe kill her - obviously he was some guy involved in the drug dealing business with Jimmy). But it seems she was afterwards honestly trying to help him (and was interested in him in other ways, but what's the point when he can't even remember her). I think both Teddy and Natalie are neither good not bad, they seem to genuinely like him, but they also both used him to solve their problems. BTW, I first thought when Natalie gave Lenny the info, that she was maybe setting Teddy up (because she knew he had something to do with Jimmy's death), but no, she hadn't even made the connection, and she told Lenny the truth that time and did help him find his guy- the guy that Lenny decided to pursue. So the lie that Teddy was guilty for Lenny's wife's death is the lie that Lenny had made up.<br/><br/>The only question that is left unanswered is: What is Lenny going to do after he's killed Teddy? Start looking for another 'John G.'? Probably."

I've never seen a movie that throws you into the body and mind of the protagonist so completely.  You and Leonard are one in the confusion as life, and the movie, happen to you. I've seen it 4 times and could see it again.  Every viewing so far has brought with it new discoveries. Enjoy!"

Films make us forget our memories for +- 90 minutes - this movie will force you think about it and will not let it go after. Finally a real challenge!"

","It is a moderately good film. But to be short, it contained far too many little flaws and inconsistencies to score higher than 7/10.<br/><br/> I was captured by the way the movie is edited. And the first film I had to think about while viewing this movie was ""L'Appartement"" This film, although much less explicitly backwards than this movie, also builds on a number of fragments of the past. But the many obvious inconsistencies make rather a dull story line in the long run made my initial excitement to be dropped at the end below a 5/10 rating. The originality of the editing and the way the story is presented and the excitement of the first half of the movie makes my overall rating as stated above.<br/><br/> My two cents."

","I'd say Memento was interesting in concept but strangely devoid of empathy for its characters. Film Noir usually deals with characters who are hard to have sympathy for but this film seems colder than most. Compare Leonard with the car salesman played by William H. Macy in Fargo. That character planned and perpetrated a terrible crime but because the script and Macy's performance gave us a full portrait of the man and his weaknesses and situation, we could have actual feeling for him. I couldn't really feel for Leonard much less for any of the other characters. Interestingly, for a film that runs backwards, certain aspects of the development of the characters still ran true to the conceits of regular movie story arcs. The first (ie: last) scene with Natalie the barmaid has her being very sympathetic to Leonard. Later on (I mean ""earlier"") in the story, Natalie lets out (spoiler alert) with a lot of venom toward Leonard that would be appropriate during the last third of a normal movie-except that at this point she has only just met him. Since female characters in movies invariably start out by hating the guy, then liking him, then getting mad at him, then forgiving him again, having a female character go through these changes backwards doesn't really break any new ground, does it?"

","'Memento' is simply the best movie of 2001.  It is unlike any other picture I've seen.  First of all, unless you haven't heard already, the entire movie goes backwards.  It starts at the end and ends at the beginning.<br/><br/>It is done this way because the main character, Leonard (Guy Pearce),has a condition where he cannot make any new memories since he witnessed the rape and murder of his wife.  Since then, the only thing he's lived for is to find the murderer and give his wife justice.  Things get complicated though when Leonard starts to challenge who he can trust between his sometimes friend Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and sometimes lover Natalie (Carrie Ann-Moss).<br/><br/>Writer-director Christopher Nolan does an excellent job in direction, never letting us know what happened before the current scene; much like Leonard. The screenplay, which Nolan adapted from his brother's short story, is beautifully crafted.<br/><br/>I hope the Oscars do not ignore this film, it is highly worthy of at least Best Director.<br/><br/>'Memento' is a must see that I highly reccommend."

","""Memento"" is definitely a different experience. Don´t worry about anybody giving the ending away, because in ""Memento"" that´s where the story begins.<br/><br/>
Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man that has a short-term memory loss, he can´t remember things that happened only moments ago. That´s why he takes pictures of everyone he gets involved with, and make tattoos all over his body, so that he can remember who he can trust. He does this because his wife has been murdered, and he is determined to track down the killer for vengeance...<br/><br/>As hinted above, the story in ""Memento"" is told backwards, it begins with the ending and ends with the beginning. It might sound that you can get lost rather easy here, but luckily the whole concept is easier than it sounds to follow. And what a brilliant one it is.<br/><br/>Newcomer Christopher Nolan is clearly a director to watch in the future, he has created one of the most original movies in a very long time, and it´s a very good one too. The acting is also great, Guy Pearce is remarkably good in the leading role. This man is clearly smart when it comes to picking jobs. Carrie-Anne Moss is as brilliant as she is beautiful and Joe Pantoliano more and more stands out as one of the most underrated actors today.<br/><br/>""Memento"" has an intriguing story, and the whole backwards-concept makes it even more enjoyable. This is one of those movies which might get better each time you watch them. That´s why I simply can´t wait to see this one again.<br/><br/>5/5"

At the end of the movie when it is revealed that wifey had actually survived, we see a shot of them together.  She's laying on his bare, tattooed chest.  Right next to her face, it says ""I did it"", under his instruction to find John G. and kill him.  That obviously wasn't there the whole rest of the film.  I scanned the whole thing looking for it.

Not that MEMENTO has a bad story, it's just that it cheats in the end. The entire film, I'm wondering and hoping this character will find his wife's murderer, I'm accepting the storytelling style... and in the end the movie falls flat on its face. What happened to Carrie-Anne Moss? There is no resolution for this character, who is obviously meant to be important for the film. And what was with the ""Sammy"" subplot? Like much else in the film, it doesn't serve much purpose or lead anywhere. Also the black and white scenes are pointless and confusing as hell. In what space in time do they occur? The present, the past? The future, maybe? But maybe I should just watch the movie again. I still recommend it though, if you wanna see something intriguing."

","The original style of storytelling is highly effective.  The plot is intense and interesting.  In fact, this movie has only one bad point--its low replay value.  A large part of the movie's intensity revolves around being in the same shoes as the protagonist, not knowing anything about a character beyond a brief hand-written note.  Once you know the full chronological story, which characters are good and which bad, the movie loses a lot of its effect.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Memento, go rent it--it's excellent.

","Actually, I have little to add to the majority of comments listed here, but since I just saw this movie the other night, and it really impressed me, I thought I might chime in:<br/><br/>The notion with which I entered the cinema was, ""How gripping may a movie be if the end is given away in the beginning?"", and the answer turned out to be- pretty much.<br/><br/>I agree, this is probably not #9 of all movies ever made. It's one more flick in the line of the others doubting our identity (like _Matrix_ or _Truman Show_), which seems to be the question of the new millenium. The acting is average, and the characters don't get too much depth, but I suspect this is a consequence of the way the story is told.<br/><br/>But the story is captivating, and it's narrated in an amazing way. The unfolding is very clever, and I found myself fully concentrating on the plot, all the time. (Of course, my attempts to be _ahead_ of the story were moot in a picture which is told _backwards_.) As opposed to _Matrix_, which seemed to me to be an insult to my intelligence, this one was a challenge to it. I had expected a lot of the audience to give up halfway through and start to chatter and stuff, but everyone seemingly stayed focussed till the end (I'd take this as a compliment to the film team)- and what an end it was! I went out of the cinema fairly disturbed...<br/><br/>Bottom line: Very nice idea, cleverly executed, always worth the admission to the cinema, or a tape's rent. But since the idea is not really _deep_, and since the way the story's told limits the story somewhat, it's not an alltime great. 8.5/10<br/><br/>(P.S.: Some people questioned why Leonard would know where to find his photos and stuff all the time- he repeatedly pointed out in the picture that he has conditioned himself to do so, that he got into the 'habit' of looking for them, a feat he still could manage, as opposed to Sam.)"

Well, the answer is YOUonly you can convince yourself to judge what you will take as real and what isn't. You make these judgments based on past experiences. These past experiences are brought into the equation by your memory. At least you have your memory, that will save your sanity because your memories are realaren't they?<br/><br/>I believe learning of a film through reviews and comments, such as this one, helps convince people to go watch a film. I also believe hearing too much hype can completely spoil a potentially sound film. As I recall, my past experiences have taught me this. So am I going to spoil this film for a reader who hasn't seen it yet? If that were true I wouldn't be trying to convince people to go watch it. But they should, because they would realize that a film is not a good film unless they are entertained. So what if the entertainment is built around small intervals of confusion? Every day life is one big blob of confusion, except memories are constantly rushing in at high speed to save the day, so fast that we don't even remember we were confused in the first place.

","Memento is a very good film.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has crafted one of the best films of the last couple years. It has many things going for it. The concept was clever and consistent, the editing was sharp, and through most of the film you could almost empathize with Leonard and his ""condition"".<br/><br/>However, it is not the ninth best film of all time. I'm not positive that Nolan is a big Hitchcock fan, but he should be thrilled that Memento is ranked above every one of Hitchcock's films.<br/><br/>If you don't appreciate the plot devices, you probably won't like the film. You are actually forced to connect with Leonard, follow the notes and solve the mystery, because there is nothing else for you to do or see.<br/><br/>The characters, scenery and plot are all secondary. Without the devices, it would look like a tame NYPD Blue episode. To keep your attention from finish to start, nothing is unintentionally given away. To accomplish this, the places and people Leonard sees are limited in number as well as range, and hints are parceled out sparingly from scene to scene.<br/><br/>If you take everything into consideration, M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is a more complete recent film with some of the same qualities. Christopher Nolan deserves much acclaim for Memento, but it shouldn't be among the greatest of all time."

","""Memento"" is not really one of the ten greatest films of all time, but that's hardly an insult.  It's a very intelligent, stylish neo-noir film with a creative concept and solid execution.  The concept is actually quite simple, but effective-- the backward narrative allows us to slowly uncover the mysterious beginning.  And, much like the protagonist, we are never actually certain what is really going on.  ""Memento"" isn't as complex and innovative as some would have you believe, but it certainly deserves its hype more than, say, ""Being John Malkovich"".  <br/><br/>The brilliance of the film actually lies in how beautifully and thoroughly the narrative conveys the basic theme-- memory is subjective.  We all make sense of our lives through little mementoes and fragments of memories, believing in whatever stories we have told ourselves to give meaning to those memories... stories which may be completely inaccurate.  Lenny is just an extreme case of a condition that we all experience.<br/><br/>***Mild spoilers***<br/><br/>The ending of the film only furthers this notion.  Some reviewers have complained about plot holes, and the uncertainty over whether the background story told by Teddy near the end is accurate.  And yet this is precisely the point.  All memories have gaps.  All events in real life have plot holes to those who experience them-- we don't have access to a narrator providing explanatory voice-overs.  And all of us center our lives around a set of questionable assumptions.  Does it really matter if Lenny got the right guy... or if his wife was really murdered... or if Sammy really existed?  Of course not. All that matters, and all that you ultimately have, are a few little crumbs of hard evidence and your own interpretation. <br/><br/>

By showing us the scenes in reverse, we're forced to forget what just happened and so we can get a real sense of the disorientation and resulting frustration of not knowing what's happening or what led up to it. Combining it with the forward-going plot line of Sammy Jankis serves to push the disorientation and confusion even further. A brilliant, utterly ingenious concept of film-making, if you ask me.

","I found this film to be very well made.  This movie is about an insurance claims agent who loses his short term memory, which he believes he can regain by avenging the death of his dead wife.  This is one of those films that goes from the end of the story to the beginning.<br/><br/>It wasn't confusing to follow the timelines as they merged to the climax, but it's not a film you really enjoy throughout.  That's probably my only criticism of this film:  you can't enjoy it until the very end.<br/><br/>Most of the time, you're sitting trying to fit the pieces together.  And do not be fooled by the beginning of the film.  I thought I had it figured it in the first 10 minutes, but the ending is absolutely impossible to guess. The editing on this film was near flawless.<br/><br/>If you want a film that will intrigue and challenge you, this is it.

","The trick with a movie like this is to balance intrique and suspense without confusing the heck out of your audience.  Memento does too much of the latter for the majority of moviegoers.  Without giving away too much, the chronology is almost impossible to follow the first time seeing it.  Even some of my very experienced movie-goer friends didn't like it, and won't spend money buying or renting the movie again and again just to figure it out.  I give this movie a 7 out of 10 right now, but it will probably change for the better as I see more of it.

It sounded different ans intriguing in a way so I thought, why not? Better than seeing some dumb popcorn movie.  I went with my mom to see it and we were both in awe of how they could pull off the movie like that.  I forgot the events that happened at the beginning of the movie like I was experiencing memory loss.  I had to explain a lot of it to my mom and while I was explaining it I was beginning to confuse myself...so I have a few questions to throw out there So, was Teddy a bad guy?? Did he die at the end (or beginning)? I have to see the movie again.  And the way Christopher Nolan had the scenes happen and then a few minutes later he showed the scene that was leading up to it and why certain things happend.  For example, Leonard wrote Do not trust his lies on Teddy's picture.  Although I am not sure I get everything that I saw, this movie is brilliant piece of filmaking."

The director who made this movie didn't have the benefit of a huge studio with lots of money to promote it that so many other movies that basically suck do. I hadn't seen not one commercial on tv for this movie but since I'm an internet geek the sites I visit had so many favorable comments on this movie it piqued my interest and now that I've seen it I'm not disappointed. This movie succeeded on word of mouth alone, what a great testament to the huge influence of that elusive commodity-human interest.

It is rare to find something different offered to moviegoers that is so excellent but this movie fits the bill. I have no complaints, enjoyed every minute and will be watching it again."
"tritisan","9","0","1","1 December 2001"," my $.02
","I've only seen this film once, and I think I need to see it a couple more times to really sort things out. But here's my initial impressions.<br/><br/>I'm a sucker for any film which explores memory and how it makes us what we are. (Blade Runner, Groundhog Day and The Usual Suspects come to mind. What, you wonder why I mentioned Groundhog Day? It's a truly great film, and in a sense, it's like Memento inverted. Bill Murray is the only who can remember he's stuck in a time loop; everyone else forgets.) Memento does a particularly good job, since it forces you to remember events in a new way: backwards. It also makes you wonder about who has control of the narrative. Just because we are shown events doesn't mean they actually happened.<br/><br/>
For instance (SPOILER ALERT), Teddy tries to convince Lenny that his wife needed insulin injections. We see a flashback of Lenny pressing a syringe into his wife's thigh. But then we see another quick flashback of the same scene, only Lenny is pinching her thigh this time. Lenny is thrown off, calling into question the stability of his long term memory. And we the viewers question which story is ""true"".<br/><br/>Heady stuff indeed. But that's one of the problems I have with Memento. It's too much like a game using people as pawns. The characters were hard to empathize with, partly because they were so hard to figure out, and partly because there was something inhuman about them. One exception is Sammy's wife, the only person I could truly feel for in the film (but did she even exist?) For a while, I could feel sorry for Lenny's loss of his wife and his memory, but his thuggish behavior and calculated plotting became increasingly psychopathic. I, for one, cannot sympathize with murderers.<br/><br/>So, I highly recommend Memento, but it certainly does not belong on the IMDB Top 10."
"ajdagreat","10","0","2","29 November 2001"," love the movie, hate the hype
","Every time a very good modern movie comes around, it automatically joins the top-ranked of movies at IMDB. ""Memento"" is the prime example of this practice, since at the time I'm writing this it's #9 on the list, beating out so many classics it's not even funny. Yes, I really enjoyed this movie...but #9 of all time? I think not. In fact, 30 of the top 100 movies on the IMDB's top 250 list are made 1990 or later. I think that's just ridiculous. Come on, people! Don't you watch the classics?<br/><br/>But indeed, ""Memento"" may deserve to be in the top 100 more than ""Moulin Rouge"" or ""Toy Story 2."" ""Memento"" is a movie that really takes some thought. I didn't quite grasp the plot the first 1 and 1/2 times I saw it, so I looked on the Internet for some interpretation. <br/><br/>SPOILERS BEGIN<br/><br/>I still don't understand a few things though, a few minor details. Was Natalie really beaten up by Dodd, or did she just lie to Leonard because she wanted Dodd killed? Is Teddy a crooked cop mixed up in drugs, or did he just want an easy way to kill Jimmy the drug dealer?<br/><br/>As for the message in ""Memento"", I recall reading ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" waaaaaay back in high school (last year). One of the key messages in that book was, well, that it's a sin to kill a mockingbird. Why? Because mockingbirds are innocent and have no means of defending themselves. Atticus teaches this lesson to Scout to tell her not to exploit the weak and innocent. That is seen later in the book because that is exactly what Bob Ewell is doing to Tom Robinson.<br/><br/>In my opinion, ""Memento"" has a similar moral. I can't think of a single character who didn't exploit Leonard's weakness somewhere during the movie. Teddy did it. Natalie did it. The hotel guy did it. Even that guy sitting at the bar who spit in his drink did it. And then finally, in the last scene of the movie, Leonard does it to himself. He exploits his own weakness. He lies to himself. Now that is deep. <br/><br/>SPOILERS END<br/><br/>Yes, it's the best movie that's been made in a while, but as they say, they don't make 'em like they used to. You should definitely see this movie if you were considering it, but please don't vote it another 10 or 9. It really doesn't need any more hype."

","The term ""thriller"" is used too loosely with most movies claiming to be that, but ""Memento"" deserves that title in every respect.  It's rare to find a movie that grabs you with the plot and then tells it in a way so uniquely different. The story unfolds in reverse, so that you have to see things in the same way that Leonard Shelby, the main character of the movie has to, you don't know what happened before the present! That helps you to identify with this poor man's plight as he searches for the person who ruined his life in one night, by raping and murdering his wife, and causing a brain injury that left Leonard unable to make new memories. Some people complain about the lack of depth in the characters, but how well do you expect to get to know someone who has no short term memory and who has to scribble important things on notes and get tattoos to help him cope with his handicap? He's really a blank slate, and Guy Pearce portrayed him quite well. You also don't really know where the characters he encounters in the movie are coming from most of the time either, so that when the truth is revealed about who  really is the villain it is a stunning surprise! The movie really brings out how deceiving our memories can be. I thought it was a great movie!"

","The movie evokes an uncanny simulation of memory loss for the viewer by the clever way in which the narrative is organized. It shows us how our identity is based on memory; when we lose our memory we completely lose our sense of self and our anchoring in reality.

The story of a memory-impaired man who's looking for his wife's killer, it tells about his quest in a very different way-by reversing the chronological order of events leading to the murder of the man he's looking for. That way, you're like Leonard (the movies' protagonist, extremely well played by Guy Pearce), you have no idea how you got to that point. Oh, Leonard writes little notes and adds remarks to Polaroid photos of people he meets, but still he's mostly in the dark. Not a very good way to search for your wife's killer, and Leonard finds out in the surprise ending (beginning????)

","Okay, it was really annoying at the beginning of every scene not to know what the deuce is going on.  I don't see it as a fault in the movie and realize that the director did it on purpose, in order to put the viewer in Leonard's shoes -- disoriented, overwhelmed, desperately clawing at clues which may be deceptive.  I think it was a brilliant, unique, and innovative way to tell the story.<br/><br/>However, I think that certain ""seeds"" of doubt were planted into the story, unresolved questions which are just barely suggested, but not developed as much as one would want to.  Here are some issues:<br/><br/> -- Who did kill Leonard's wife?  I understand that the lack of an answer is explained by Leonard's unique disorder, but her death remains too shrouded in mystery, I think.<br/><br/> -- Leonard claims to have remembered everything up until his injury.  But is it really true?  Could have his previous life have been invented, the old memories a product of denial and pained consciousness?  For one, I was surprised that the movie did not show a weepy and idealized picture of Leonard's relationship with his wife (a la ""The Crow""); the flashbacks show that Leonard probably had a problematic, maybe even troubled marriage.  The scenes almost invariably show him in conflict with the woman whose death he wants to avenge.  Was Leonard's wife really murdered by an unknown villain (or villains), or did he have something to do with her disappearance from his life?<br/><br/> -- There is more than a fortuitous insistence on the fact that short-term memory loss may be psychological, not physical, in nature.  Should one take for granted the fact that Leonard's condition was brought on by a physical trauma?  Or could it have been induced by an extremely guilty and troubled mind?<br/><br/> -- In light of that, how exactly was Leonard's wife gone?  Was she murdered?  Did she commit suicide or simply leave Leonard, causing him to suffer a catastrophic mental breakdown?<br/><br/>Perhaps I am reading into it.  Perhaps not."

When it is revealed that Leonard is in fact Sammy Jankis, the point is not over-stressed. There are really only two or three shots that display this fact to the audience. The director doesn't go back to bang into your head everything you've already seen, like M. Night Shyamalan does at the end of the Sixth Sense. Instead, it is assumed that the audience is smart enough to get the point without the complete and total reiteration of the last hour and a half.

"Spleen","9","0","2","20 November 2001"," Nothing much to say - I just want to add another voice to the general chorus of praise.
","The year 2000 produced, so far as I can tell, just three flawless gems; this is one of them.  The narrative device is the kind of flashy gimmick writers dream about being able to use properly: the story is divided into lots and lots of very very small chapters - each chapter connecting directly to the next - and we are given these chapters backwards, last to first.  (Yes, I know it's not as classically simple as that - there's also the black-and-white footage.  But this serves the function of expository narrative; it isn't a chapter in its own right.)  It's amazing that EVERY SINGLE ONE of the umpteen transitions back in time works dramatically, and that the story makes far more sense this way, and is easier to follow, than it would told chronologically.  So perfectly cast is the narrative that it's impossible to tell which idea came first, the technical challenge of telling the story backwards, or the exceedingly clever story that justifies this conceit.<br/><br/>We open watching a killing in an abandoned building and the puzzle is how we got there.  That's ALL the puzzle is.  The film won't even tell us, until the end (beginning) whether this is a whodunnit, a Thorndyke-like police procedural, a gestalt-shift exercise, or something else.  The protagonist, who has no long-term memory, is precisely as lost as we are; the only thread that feels secure to him when he tugs on it is the knowledge that he's out to avenge the death of his wife - and he seeks revenge mainly because he's left himself little notes he's left for telling him to.  So good to see a Hollywood movie willing to make fun of the very idea of revenge, although this is a minor virtue of a very rich work."

","Momento is like no other movie i have ever seen or am likely to ever see. This a film that that is fairly easy to describe the outline of the plot but almost impossible to describe the story. Guy Pierce plays an insurance investigator who suffers from short term memory loss after a bash on the head during the murder of his wife. this means that he can't retain any memories for more than 5 minutes although he can remember eveything before the accident. With this affliction he tries to find the killer of his wife to inflict revenge. The way the film plays out is quite brilliant. It has little pattern yet it is so watchable simply because all the time you are trying to work out what it going. It is like the viewer has the same term memory loss as the main character.While it is almost impossible to know where you are in the story it is not irritating in the way some films can be when the story is to complicated. Guy Pierce is superb and pulls this off to perfection.But i think a big congratulation goes to Christopher and Jonathon Nolan for the brilliant direction and writing. 9 out of 10."

","Don't read this one unless you have already seen the movie...could ruin the fun!<br/><br/>Sorry for the shouting headline, but it seems that almost everyone thought the time sequences ran backwards in the movie. That is actually only half right. The sequences are interleaved -- one color sequence, then one black and white sequence. The color sequences start at the end and get progressively earlier in time, while the B&W sequences start at the beginning and progress forward in time (i.e., each one picking up where the last left off). The final sequence of the movie (which is the middle of the story) starts in black and white, then brilliantly and subtly shifts into color as the two timelines come together (the shift occurs as the polaroid of Jimmy G is developing).<br/><br/>To illustrate, suppose for a moment there are 8 sequences in the movie. In real time, the sequences occur in order from 1 to 8.  In the movie, they would be presented in the following order:<br/><br/>8 - color<br/><br/>1 - b&w<br/><br/>7 - color<br/><br/>2 - b&w<br/><br/>6 - color<br/><br/>3 - b&w<br/><br/>5 - color<br/><br/>4 - b&w becomes color<br/><br/>The transition from B&W to color in the final scene is *very* subtle...I didn't notice it the first time I watched the movie, and at first I also thought the timeline moved backwards.  I watched it again the next day, noticed the change in the final scene, then realized the story was converging on the middle rather than going back in time.<br/><br/>Definitely a fresh and interesting twist -- I thought it was sort of like ""Pulp Fiction"" (out of sequence storyline) meets ""The Usual Suspects"" (ending which calls into question all assumptions made by the viewer since the beginning) meets the book ""Time's Arrow"" by Martin Amis (man lives his entire live in reverse).<br/><br/>Also, after watching it the first time, there was a strange lingering affect, where for a while afterward, linear time didn't seem quite right to me.

It is an intelligent film, truly original, and it is interesting from beginning to end (or rather from end to beginning). Guy Pearce delivers a brilliant performance and the supporting actors are great as well. Memento is a movie that you will think about after you've left the cinema, whether you liked it or not.

","Every once-in-a-while a film comes along that simply blows the viewer's mind. The Usual Suspects, A Simple Plan, and Magnolia are a few that did so for me. I can now add Memento to that distinguished list.<br/><br/>Memento is a dictionary-definition of top drawer filmmaking. Director Christopher Nolan, basing the story from his brother's idea, has put together the most intricate web of a movie that I have seen in some time, and my hunch is that it was not easy. The entire story is told backwards, with the opening scene actually being the conclusion to the story. This is the first film I have ever seen with a surprise beginning.<br/><br/>The story of revenge is really nothing new. It is Nolan's twist in his filmmaking that makes it all seem fresh.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce portrays Leonard, a man who suffers from the effects of anterograde amnesia, a disorder in which the victim can only remember events from a certain point forward (usually the event that caused the amnesia). The last thing he remembers is his wife being assaulted and killed. Now he is out to find the killers and get his revenge.<br/><br/>Because of Leonard's disorder, he must try and accomplish his revenge with notes and tattoos to remind himself of key facts. No easy task, but he is set in his ways, and wants justice.<br/><br/>Nolan puts the viewer directly in Leonard's shoes, making it easy for us to sympathize with him. This was crucial for the story to work, and Nolan accomplished it effortlessly.<br/><br/>Pearce, who has always favored roles along the lines of this one, plays Leonard flawlessly, with a fierce and determined look, and also that of desperation. The screenplay makes full use of him, and my hunch is that Pearce will have the character of Leonard engrained in him for the rest of his career. Excellent supporting roles are provided by Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano. Who should Leonard trust?<br/><br/>This is dramatic cinema at its best, and in my opinion one of the top three films of the year. This is the kind of movie you find yourself discussing with strangers in line at the grocery store.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and see the finest, most engrossing film to come along in the past few years.<br/><br/>A+"

","`Memento' is what I call a feel-good movie in a positive sense because it offers you more little I-see-experiences during two hours than any other thriller or crime movie before was able to. By seeing half of the plot beginning with the chronologically last scene, every scene makes the viewer ask questions of more or less important character: `How did Leonard come there?' `Why is he doing this and that?', and in one of the following (=previous) scenes we get the answers, when we have actually just forgotten the question. Really, Christopher Nolan not only plays with the short-time memory of his main character, but also with ours!<br/><br/>Of course, `Memento' is not a `great movie'; it's not revolutionary because it's hard to imitate it well (which is not at all a bad thing). But it's a completely unique movie like `Being John Malkovich' or `The Truman Show'. Strangely, this kind of movies has always been underrated, not by the audience but by critics and the Academy. `Memento' is absolutely constructed; the base idea itself is what rules the whole movie. And  particularly with Guy Pearce, that blonded, mimeless main actor  it remains cold. No warmth. That's why it is not a `great movie' for me, but it is a feel-good movie and shows absolute technical perfection. 9 out of 10."

","I spent considerable time doing research on the brain for a class I was teaching.  One of the most intriguing things I dealt with was the idea of short term memory.  There are cases of people who carry around a suitcase with them, containing all the things they need to continually review to stay in the present with any sort of functionality.  I had heard about this film and read a very sketchy review.  I rented it because I knew my family wouldn't be interested in the violence.  So late at night, I sat and took this film in with total concentration.  I need to watch it again, but right now it may have cracked my top ten list.  The last time I was so enthralled by a film was Coppola's ""The Conversation.""  Both of these films are fairly bleak and occasionally confusing and absolutely captivating. How anyone can be bored by this with all the junk that is being produced these days, I will never understand.  I know it's a gimmick film.  I know it's manipulative. So what?  Don't all films manipulate us, especially those steeped in mystery and suspense.  I knew exactly what was going on and I couldn't wait to see how it ended (began).  <br/><br/>At first there are so many questions--why the self mutilation?  Why are these people treating this man this way?  Where is he?  How did he get there?  Who does he work for?  Does he actually work for anyone?  And yet, how skillfully is is all done.  I suppose if you want to begin nit picking, you can come up with a few inconsistencies.  This doesn't detract from the way that the principle character floats from even to even, trying to recoup his memory each time he faces the day.  The one thing I will grant is the emotional investment required for revenge--but because he is aware of his shortcomings, he feels he must act.  If  you are bored with most movies these days, rent this and it will affect you for a long time."

","After looking at some of the other comments for this great film, I felt somewhat obligated to put in my two cents.  It seems as if a lot of the people who said that they didn't enjoy this movie were trying to find something wrong with it, and if you are watching with that in mind, you are pretty much guaranteed to hate it.  The so-called ""flaws"" in the plot are completely neccesary to get the point of this movie across.  In a roundabout way, the main premise behind this movie is the age-old question ""If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" The only way to really understand the main character is to not understand some of the details surrounding his situation.  The point of this movie is to make you ask questions, not answer them.  The main ""flaw"" that everone seems to point out is how he remembers that he has his ""condition"".  What everyone seems to ignore is that the condition leaves him with no sense of passing time, so nobody really knows how long he has been like this.  It has obviously been long enough for him to adjust to the situation, and this is shown by the fact that he knows he has to write things down and take pictures of people.  Lets face it, if someone was not aware of a condition like that, they wouldn't be able to survive in daily life and even the tattoo that reminds him to remember Sammy would be a way to understand the condition.  Anyway, enough of that.  As long as you are not trying to figure out ways to attack the storyline, or the director, or the hundred other things that the so-called ""movie buffs"" are always looking for, this is an excellent, original movie.  It may take a day or two to sink in, but eventually the fact that you really don't know what exactly happened makes this movie that much better.  The key to this movie is not asking why or why not, it is asking ""What if?"""

It's the story of a man who was in an accident that left him unable to make short term memories.  He can remember everything before the accident, and long term memories...but he cannot remember what happened 10 minutes ago.  This is a very odd movie to say the least.  The movie plays out in reverse order, and it keeps going back and forth between two main stories.  The lead played by some actor who I have never seen before is really nice...I think he did a really good job with the character, and I hope to see him in movies more often.  I love Pantoliano, and his character as well.  The movie is violent in some parts, but there's a nice mix of comedy between the character with the bad memory and Pantoliano's character.

","Others have noted that if the last thing the main character remembers is his wife dying, then he shouldn't remember that he has short-term memory loss. Some might consider this the fatal flaw of ""Memento"".  I recognize it as a flaw, but I don't find it fatal.  ""Memento"" makes a poignant comment on the role emotion and prejudice play in the construction of memories.  By sequencing events in a finish-to-start chronology , ""Memento"" manages to envelope the audience in the same bewilderment that the main character (Guy Pearce of ""L.A. Confidential fame in a terrific performance) experiences while also playing on our emotions and prejudices.  We have to struggle to keep the plot straight, and as events prior to the ones we've just seen unfold, the assumptions we've made about the characters get challenged and the characters' actions take on new meaning.  We have to reinterpret everything that's happened just as the main character does.  Dark, stimulating and stylish."

A friend mentioned to me what a great movie this was and mentioned the plot and some details to me - usually this does not bother me, but unfortunately, this time it made the movie slightly less enjoyable for me since I knew too much about the movie. If you have not seen this movie yet, try not to learn too much about it before you see it.<br/><br/>I thought Memento was well directed and well acted by all the lead actors. The movie goes backwards in time and it works well, going backwards is not done often, but for this movie it was necessary - if it was aired in the correct order, Memento would have been less remarkable. I wonder if the original story was meant to go backwards in time?<br/><br/>I have to admit, the only thing I find disturbing about Memento is the high ranking it has in the IMDb top 250 movies.

","This movie is so complex and well-planned that it actually made my head spin after seeing it twice.  It's not the information - it's the way you receive it.  Leonard is a man incapable of making new memories due to an injury he sustained in trying to foil the rape and murder of his wife.  Christopher Nolan puts you in his head with his rewind editing. You see a scene, but like Leonard you don't know what happened the scene before.  So you don't know what is really happening.  You don't know who the other characters really are.  You have the watch the next scene (i.e. what happened earlier) to piece the film together.  It is this format of time that forces your own mind to get a little dizzy trying to keep up.<br/><br/>I say see this twice because it takes that to fully grab the movie.  From my own experience, I got the overall gist of it the first time, but I spent so much time trying to piece the movie together that I missed some important, obvious details.  It takes a second viewing (once you're not as confused as Leonard is) to catch these details and grasp a more full understanding of it.<br/><br/>The scenes pasted together going backward is the big thing making this movie special.  If it were conventional in its use of time, Leonard would be nobody we could relate to.  But by going back in time in increments at a time, we experience the movie with an even greater suspense, while getting a firsthand lesson in what it's like to have no short-term memory.  It's brilliant enough to come up with this concept to tell the story, but the details within each scenes, and set of scenes, make this an outstanding script and direction by Christopher Nolan.  It's as good as advertised - see it.. at least twice!"

","About a couple of months ago, I read with curious interest, a review of a movie called Memento on Mr. Showbiz. It caught my eye coz of my fellow Aussie, Guy Pearce(LA Confidential, Ravenous) starring in it. Since then, I have waited and waited and waited...until finally a couple of days ago, I saw it in my local video library. I knew it was a thriller about a guy out for revenge, but the pace, the acting, the plot and the structure of this movie totally astounded me. My girlfriend wasn't too keen on watching it initially, but in the end she was so hooked on to the movie, that she missed her bus to work and had to catch a cab! I won't ruin this picture for you other than letting you know what a gem of a movie this is!! A noirish thriller with superb pacing, directing and competent acting by the ensemble cast, especially from Guy Pearce as the insurance investigator/detective Leonard Shelby. Glad to see the Aussies doing so well and making quality pics rather than just mindless, brain-numbing blockbusters...Do not miss this movie for any reason!!! I have rated this 9 out of 10 simply because I never rate any movie as being perfect. But this one is right up there..after all 15,000 voters and a top 10 rank from IMDb users can't go wrong, can it?<br/><br/>Cheers Rahul Prasad"

Carrie Anne Moss shows off her acting chops more so in this movie than in any other.  Guy Pearce's disaffected demeanor are perfect for this type of role.

"emguy","7","0","2","20 October 2001"," Cleverly done, but not 9th greatest
","As I write this, Memento holds IMDB's 9th spot on the IMDB Top 250 list. This movie is NOT the 9th-greatest film ever made. It's a gimmick film, cleverly done with nice atmospherics and several plot surprises, but still a gimmick film. This seems like a case of ""IMDB Syndrome"" -- a tendency to vote at the extremes for recent movies, especially the gimmicky or culty movies. IMO, the voting on any movie in IMDB is not to be taken too seriously until at least two years after the movie's release.<br/><br/>The movie's not bad, basically a brief scene at the beginning with a chain of flashbacks until the movie stops. Though the setting is different, the premise is very much like the Gene Wolfe novel, Soldier of the Mist.<br/><br/>Few questions are answered (deliberately it would seem), so if you like nice tidy endings, this isn't the movie for you. If you like movies that require that you pay attention at every moment and that make you reconstruct storylines in your head while you watch, you'll probably like this.<br/><br/>The movie did a good job of presenting the POV of someone whose memory is perpetually slipping away, and who can never be sure of what's going on around him.<br/><br/>Eventually, the series of flashbacks was starting to get a little old, and I found myself thinking, ""Isn't it about time for you guys to wrap this up?"" The movie was starting to feel padded.<br/><br/>But overall, not a bad movie."
"JehuDVD","Null","0","1","17 October 2001"," CU Film Critic takes on ""Memento.""
","`Along Came a Spider,' last week's commode-worthy flick, had a production budget of well over 100 million big'uns.  `Memento,' which opened in Boulder this week, was made for a 12,500th of that amount.  That's right.  Eight thousand dollars.   The beauty of this is that `Memento' turned out to be a masterpiece among the no-account strips of celluloid passing for quality film that are currently in theaters. Memento, a favorite at last year's Sundance Film Festival which has finally seen a wide US release, opens immediately with a man being shot and killed. We are then shown, in a series of flashbacks, what has just transpired.  In effect, we are shown the end at the beginning, and director Christopher Nolan (`Following') takes us into a time warp where, at the end of the film, we finally see the whole picture for what it is.  Paul Harvey would be proud.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce, aside from looking a lot like what Val Kilmer and Brad Pitt would end up with if they had a kid, stars as Leonard Shelby.  Leonard suffers from short-term memory-loss, and is unable to keep a new memory for more than five minutes or so.  Hence the flashbacks.  We immediately discover that Leonard's wife has been murdered by `John G.,' and that Leonard is seeking vengeance.  The trouble, however, is that Leonard's condition forces him to rely on scribbled notes, tattooed messages covering his body, and his Polaroid camera to remind him where he is and what he is trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>This is brilliant stuff.  It's not necessarily a new concept; a similar idea was explored in the 1997 German film `Winterschlaefer.'  The real beauty of this film is in its execution.  We're given just enough information that we always lose sight of where we are at the most crucial moment.  We're pulled out of the story countless times and brought into an unfamiliar place; or at least we think it's unfamiliar.  Watching this movie is like HAVING short-term memory loss!<br/><br/>Aside from having an insanely ingenious foundation, we're given a lot to chew on while the film zigs and zags in its attempts to shake our inner detectives.  Director Nolan gives us some great colorful characters, notably Teddy and Natalie (respectively, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss, co-stars in `The Matrix'), who have both our sympathy and loathing through most of the film.  I can't say enough about this movie.  I don't know if I've seen this good a film since `American Beauty.'  Nolan's to-the-point style of directing gets rid of all the abstract fluff that's become the ensign of low-budget indy film.  `Memento' may be low-budget, but it's not cheap.<br/><br/>My favorite moment injects some laughs;  at one point Leonard (and the audience) is brought back from a lapse into the middle of a life-or-death chase scene, and he can't remember whether he's doing the chasing or being chased.  However, most of the laughs come mostly at your own expense when you realize you've completely been hoodwinked on more than one occasion.<br/><br/> `Memento' is the best film currently in theaters.  That's not saying much, so I'll follow it up by saying that it's the best film any theater has hosted this year.  The movie was originaly released in 2000, but is just now making its way out of the major cities-  don't let the opportunity to see this one go by.  `Memento' gets an `A.'"

","I am truly baffled at the number of people who gave this film a bad review simply because they were ""confused"", ""lost"", and especially ""didn't understand the ending."" Duh-- that's the point of a thriller, you are supposed to be confused. And with a great thriller--you shouldn't be able to put together each & every detail. Part of the beauty of that is that it leads to many, many different conclusions & possibilities.<br/><br/>This film was one of the few films in the last several years to actually be DIFFERENT, with a storyline that grips you & will not let go. The reverse order of the movie is not gimmicky, it is an integral part of the story (i.e., the audience feels what the lead character is feeling.) Several people commented that they didnt understand comparisons to ""Usual Suspects"" and ""Sixth Sense""---the similarity is that everything you assumed to be true the entire movie turns out not to be true in such a way that 99.9% of audiences would never guess.<br/><br/>The acting was very good here, but I also haven't heard enough about the brilliance of the screenwriting itself. The dialogue was insightful and many sentences were just so powerful that just made me stop and say ""wow. that's deep.""<br/><br/>Great & unique movie, you have to be a person with a somewhat analytical mind to sort through all the data presented, but also be a very patient person. I think people who are impatient will just get  fed up & quit on the movie.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see Chris Nolan's next film. It just intrigues me to no end how he could even come up with such an original & very powerful story."
"MrTonyT","9","0","1","16 October 2001"," What more can be said?
","I was never the type of person to like a movie where you had to think a lot. Adam Sandler type movies satisfied my movie tastes quite well. That was until a couple of years ago when one of my friends introduced me to ""The Usual Suspects"". That movie broadened my horizons yet I haven't liked a movie that much since... Until now. Memento has now firmly lodged itself next to Usual Suspects as one of my favourite ""thinking person's"" movie.<br/><br/>
I'm sure you all know the plot and such by now but do yourself a favour and try to go into this movie knowing as little as possible. It makes it all the more enjoyable. What I can do, though, is give it my strongest recommendation.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"doodah367","Null","0","1","18 October 2001"," The direction is the real winner (spoilers)
","Many people have found Memento frustrating, and I can see why.  After concentrating so hard on keeping up with the action and being convinced that you are being led back to an explosive finale, you just end up with Guy Pearce saying ""now, where was I?"" and you realise that you've been concentrating so hard on absolutely nothing.  I, however, thought that this movie was absolute genius.<br/><br/>Director Christopher Nolan uses a post-Tarantino style narrative, moving the story backwards.  It's good to see some new styles of narrative as opposed to the 'Pulp Fiction' style with stories all interlinking towards the conclusion.  Not only does the storytelling style impress, but it also puts the viewer right into the head of Leonard Shelby.  Yes, it's frustrating - but Nolan is just trying to convey to you how frustrating it is for Shelby, and he has chosen the best possible way of doing it.<br/><br/>The three protagonist performances from Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are good.  Pantoliano and Moss in particular are superb in convincing the audience that they're something what they are not.  However, the real superstar in the film is Christopher Nolan's outstanding direction and script.  He never tells the audience too much to make the film boring, but he also never tells too little to keep the audience guessing.  There are so many 'blink and you'll miss it' moments (keep an eye out for Sammy Jankis sitting in the residential home) that you cannot absorb everything necessary in one viewing.  What Nolan has successfully done is keep the audience in the palm of his hand and thrown them into the head of Leonard Shelby.  And I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>**********"

","Its about time people that make movies actually got a clue. All these ""great"" directors, and most of them suck. There is one facet of movie making that prevents them from being quality. That facet is called money. Film makers make movies to bring in revenue, so they can buy a house in Cali, buy a lot of Cocaine and percocets, and have sex with beautiful women. The typical hollywood cat. I don't care how good an actor is, if the movie sucks, it sucks. bottom line. So heres the deal, once in a great while a director comes along and says I am going to CREATE a movie that is intriguing, mysterious, and very mind-engaging to view. Noyce (director) did this with Memento. This movie is astoundingly good. The characters are all screwed up, and very human. Carrie-ann Moss (chick from Matrix) is in it and actually plays the role of a true female human, a bitch. This is great. If you have not seen this movie then go and see it. It is definately worth the money. You will NEED to see it again. I did."

I felt like all the scenes included the opening and closing of doors (usually car doors), along with shots around cars, watching the cars pull away, scenes where characters LOOK at or comment on cars.   Is that what it's about?   It's so low budget feeling.<br/><br/>The story, the unfolding, or re-folding, is much better than the production or the editing, so brace yourself if you haven't seen the film.

I have to say that it is a very satisfying experience, an extremely intriguing movie that will keep you wondering what will happen next. The unusual storytelling style will just involve you even more into the main character's own experience.<br/><br/>But ""Memento"" is not grand like ""The Godfather"" is. Not even comparable. I would say it is a VERY GOOD movie, with a very intelligent plot, and great use of storytelling.<br/><br/>However, I cannot believe nor understand those who say that the film does not have a good ending (don't worry - no spoilers here). ""Memento""'s ending just brings the whole experience into perspective, it reveals the true magnitude of the main character's condition, and THAT is the surprising element.<br/><br/>Those who say that the movie is bad because it does not have an ending, are the same folks who will tell you not to visit a modern art exhibit because you won't understand the abstract paintings. Give me a break!!! If all creative individuals limited themselves to satisfy those who need to understand everything, many great artists would not even exist.<br/><br/>

","Here's my theory on Memento's ending - I hope I remembered everything correctly, I would appreciate feedback/corrections.  The whole Leonard is really Sammy Jankis is just a red herring -Teddy is just playing with his head, making the point that anything can be believed.  What really happened I think, is that Teddy is a corrupt cop who helped Leonard find the original John G.  Then he decided to use Leonard as his hitman.  Teddy hooked up with Natalie and they conspired to screw Jimmy Grants and Dodd out of 200,000 dollars with a drug deal set up. Teddy tells Leonard that Grants is the guy who killed his wife, in order to have Grants whacked.  Then however Leonard takes off with the jaguar which has the money in the trunk.  So the rest of the movie is Teddy and Natalie trying to get close to Leonard so that they can steal the money out of the trunk.  Dodd is also after Leonard, trying to get his money back, etc.<br/><br/>So, what we have at the end chronologically, is Natalie will probably end up finally getting the money from Leonard. And who knows if Dodd will show up again.  My only question is why does Jimmy Grants mumble `Sammy' before Leonard kills him? Was Leonard using this as his alibi? Just my 2 cents, appreciate any feedback."

If you cannot wrap your head around that perhaps you're better off renting Josie and the Pussycats.

There is also a good deal of humor to be found, the entire Dodd episode is pretty funny from finish to start.

While in bed with Natalie she asks about a tattoo-less section of his chest, in the picture Teddy has taken of Lenny he is grinning ear to ear and pointing to this same section of his chest, and finally just before the movie ends there is a quick scene of Lenny laying in bed with a new tattoo (and someone important). Leonard is Sammy Jenkis in a way, despite his claim he is much more organized, he has been continuously tricked into avenging his wife, similar to the way Sammy Jenkis was tricked into administering repeated insulin shots to his wife. I believe that is why Leonard replaces Sammy in an blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot.<br/><br/>**End Spoiler**"

","Too often you sit through a movie hoping that when it finally all unravels you will experience a conclusion that makes the experience worthwhile. Then, when it happens, you asked why in blazes did you waste your time (e.g. the remake of Planet of the Apes). You will not be disappointed with the conclusion of Memento. It's a movie that falls just short of being a classic, but nonetheless one that you will likely remember for some time. The reverse unfolding of the plot was not extremely difficult to follow and didn't force the viewer to continually question the significance of each scene. In other words, it was a user friendly film and the director did not find it necessary to continually confound the viewer with scenes that had to be replayed several times before they became understandable. Fans of CSI, the Sopranos and Frasier will enjoy seeing actors from these shows in another setting. Finally, a movie that's thought provoking without being overly cerebral."
"Karlos-3","8","0","3","4 October 2001"," Overall, great story telling, great flow, disappointing finish.
","This movie is truly unique. One of those movies that you MUST see. You just have to experience. All the reviews you read and all talk you hear will not do it justice.<br/><br/>The plot is simple (at first) as we have a person, Leonard, whose wife was raped and murdered and he was attacked during the incident. The whole incident (either the hit by the attacker or the traumatizing effect of seeing his wife die) left him with this illness. He lost his short term memory. He cannot form any new memories. Several times in the movie we see Lenny (Leonard) doing something, and as soon as he loses focus for several seconds, he forgets what he was doing. At one point he is being chased by an armed man, he gets tangled in a few obstacles and when he comes out of them he can't remember why he is running, he sees this man running on the opposite side of the building and he thinks he is chasing that man, as he starts running at him the man pulls out his gun and starts firing.. Lenny then realizes it is he who is being chased. In another incident.. Lenny is harassed by someone who knows his condition, that someone insults Lenny and his wife and then walks out.. Three minutes later that same person walks in (to Lenny trying to find a pen to write down that this person is bad) and the mere distraction of the door opening is enough for Lenny to forget what took place and for that person to pretend he/she was Lenny's friend.<br/><br/>From the get go, there are two things that capture your interest..<br/><br/>One, Lenny is a strange person, he has this weakness that he refuses to succumb to. He refuses to trust anyone or anything but his own observations, sentences like ""I know when someone knows me, I just look into their eyes"" strike you are pretty confident for a guy with no memory. He places infinite trust in his Tattoos, notes, files and photos. The major facts he finds about his wife's killer, he writes as a Tattoo on his body, his research work on the killer is in a file he keeps with him all the time. He leaves notes in his pocket for things he plans to do, simply by leaving them there, he is sure to revisit them later. He takes polaroid photos of all the important things in his current situation, where he's staying, his car, people he met (and on the back he writes his impressions about them). The techniques he uses to record these memories are not surprising, but the way he trusts his own handwriting and his own remarks on the back of each photo is what strikes you as odd. I believe it is a very accurate depiction by the writer of the story as anyone who has dealt with a disabled person will testify that this form of defiance and reluctance to rely on others is very much a real behavior. As Lenny himself said (describing a case he handled when he was an insurance investigator of a man who suffered from the same condition he later on acquired), ""I realized that the look of recognition in his eyes (which made me think he was faking the condition) was actually fake. He was giving that look to everyone who approaches him hoping to give them SIGNs that he is doing better.""<br/><br/>Two, the movie is told as two tales.. One moving backwards, and the other moving forwards. The reverse tale is in color and is the personification of Lenny's case. Like Lenny, you see events unfold with out knowing what took place before them. You see he is talking to a man who is trying to help him, but on the photo he has of that man he has written the sentence ""Don't trust him"" so he ignores the man's advice. You (like Lenny) have to believe the photo (of course as a viewer, you start thinking, may be that's not his handwriting, may be someone forged his handwriting to lead Lenny in the wrong way). And as this story unfolds backwards (with you having the privilege of knowing what would result from each scene because you've seen all the way till the end) the other story (shot in black and white) is moving forward. From the beginning you realize that it is taking place prior to the colored story (Lenny has less tattoos).<br/><br/>Eventually, the two stories meet near the movie's finale. Until THAT point in the movie, it is one of the greatest movies EVER.<br/><br/>But it is the finale that detracts from the movie as the director (or story writer?) tried to leave a puzzling finish to make the movie sound real deep. He succeeded in making the finish puzzling, but he failed in making the finish live up to the level of story telling and overall performance of the movie to that point.<br/><br/>Someone likened the surprising ending of this movie to the ending of the 6th Sense.. All I can say is that this statement would be true if the Sixth Sense ended in you finding out that all those ghosts the kid saw were just actors and that it was all a prank on the little boy. That's how surprising the ending of Memento is.. It's REALLY surprising, but greatly frustrating."

","This is a movie I would put in the category with Fight Club and the Usual Suspects. Not great movies, but elevated to that level by the proud-to-be-out-of-the-mainstream crowd. Those people who are in with popular alternative culture. This movie has an interesting gimmick and is pretty amusing, but that is all. It is only good for two viewings. One to be surprised, and a second to review it and say ""hmm, that was pretty clever"". I don't think this fakes insights into humanity in so much as it has had them thrust upon it by it's rabid fans, who like to justify their worship with some deeper, albeit nonexistent meaning. This film throws out little morsels of meat to that crowd for them to chew on rather than offering a whole meal of an actual moving experience. I was actually a little maddened by the ending, because without it's gimmick, there was no movie. As I said though, it was pretty entertaining. 7/10."

","Memento haunts you long after you've seen it, not only due to its refreshing storytelling, but mainly because it raises such  fundamental questions: are we what we remember we are? Is our memory the measure of our capacity to change our destiny? Is memory the basic measure to a moral conscience? It's hard to find nowadays films that deal with these interesting dilemmas (or any other interesting topics, for that matter)and Memento does it quite skillfully, as the film noir genre is the best to make it appealing to a broad audience. And noir it is. Leonard's story is a dark one. How would be ours, if a similar fate were to befall us?"

","Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a memory problem: He cannot form new memories. He forgets things a few minutes after they've occurred. This is caused by emotional and physical trauma he suffered when he once woke up in the middle of the night and saw his wife murdered by asphyxiation. Now Leonard's determined to figure how who the killer is.   To combat his ailment, Leonard takes photos with an Instamatic camera and writes a sentence or two on the back of the picture. He snaps pictures of people whom he's not sure if he just met - and he's also never sure if they're friend or foe. Among the players are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), the latter of whom supposedly lost a loved one in a similar matter and who therefore feels a sort of kinship with the traumatized Leonard. The most fascinating aspect of this movie is that it's shot out of sequence. Because Leonard's memories are pretty much kaput (he can clearly remember everything up to the murder, but not subsequent memories), we actually get to see the same scenes a couple of times. No, it's not repetitive. Here's an example. Scene fades in, and Leonard is running through backyards, cutting, juking, zigging, and zagging. He suddenly says - for we can hear his thoughts - ""Ok, where am I? He spots another man running nearby. ""Oh,"" Leonard thinks, ""I'm chasing him,"" and he starts to move in the other man's direction. Oops - the man suddenly charges back at Leonard. ""No, wait... he's chasing me!"" Leonard thinks. And in another scene, we see the events leading up to that particular chase, as well as events after it. It's up to the viewer to place them in the right order, but seeing the scenes out of sequence, I think, is very useful here. Things are clearer when they're revisited with more information. Now, when Leonard writes on the back of the photos, what he writes is influenced greatly by whatever has happened just prior to the photograph's creation. This complicates things greatly; if he thinks someone's a nice person, he'll snap the picture and write on the back that they're a nice person. But later, he'll look at the picture - without remembering anything - and take the words at face value. If it says he liked the person, then the person's good, even though he might not have known much about that person.<br/><br/> There are infinite twists to this movie, and the ending is fantastic. You may know right off that this is no ordinary who-killed-my-wife caper, but you will have a tough time predicting the outcome."

"jndiii","Null","0","2","1 October 2001"," A puzzlebox without a catharsis
","Is it a good movie?  Yes. Is it a ""must watch"" movie?  Yes. Will you enjoy it?  Maybe.<br/><br/>This is typical of four-star movies:  it's good, it's clever, it's insightful, but it isn't necessarily fun.  It's better than most movies that are given such high ratings:  it isn't snobby, it isn't a morality play, and it is reasonably fun to put the story together.<br/><br/>
POSITIVES:<br/><br/>The presentation of the story is quite clever, though not unprecedented. The main character's predicament becomes the viewer's.  There is no catharsis, however, and that will leave many viewers cold.  It can be argued that the point of the movie is to BE the puzzlebox, and to enable the viewer to identify with the main character, and this is where the 9 and 10 scores come in.  If you don't expect a cathartic ending, or find catharsis a bit too predictable, you'll probably be raving about this movie yourself.<br/><br/>
NEGATIVES:<br/><br/>While it remains logically consistent, it plays coy with the facts to an extreme degree.  Its main flaw is that it lacks a clear, conventional resolution.  To get the most out of it, you'll need to watch it several times, and if you have the DVD or access to the internet, read through the haphazard clues left out of the movie itself.  Some people will find this very annoying, while others will be utterly delighted.<br/><br/>

Not forced 'surprise' endings, but movies that really turn out to not go in the direction in which you expected them to go.<br/><br/> Memento is a movie about personal motivation, the desirability of truth, and justice. It's conclusion was startling to me... that the first of that list of three significantly overrides the other two, at least for a man constantly in a prelusive state.  The only way that Lenny could give his life any meaning at all, the only way he could preserve his life, is by ensuring that he constantly had an objective that he could systemically strive for. Thus he invented John G., and made his  existence a pursuit of him.<br/><br/> Another interesting conclusion of this movie is that this man is constantly going around killing people, and even though he doesn't realize it, he is responsible for their deaths.  He may not at every moment be aware that the man he is pursuing is innocent of that which he accuses him, yet at the point where he made that decision he was aware of it.  He is, then, completely responsible, and should, if ever caught, spend the rest of his life living a three-minute jail sentence."

","Don't read this one unless you have already seen the movie...could ruin the fun!<br/><br/>I noticed that many people have stated in their reviews that time goes backwards in the movie.  That is actually only half right.  The sequences are interleaved -- one color sequence, then one black and white sequence. The color sequences start at the end and get progressively earlier in time, while the B&W sequences start at the beginning and progress forward in time (i.e., each one picking up where the last left off).  The final sequence of the movie (which is the middle of the story) starts in black and white, then brilliantly and subtly shifts into color as the two timelines come together (the shift occurs as the polaroid of Jimmy G is developing).<br/><br/>To illustrate, let's say there are 11 sequences in the movie.  Temporally, they occurr in order from 1 to 11.  However, in the movie, they appear 1, 11, 2, 10, 3, 9, 4, 8, 5, 7, 6, where 1-5 are B&W, 7-11 are color, and 6 begins in B&W then changes to color.<br/><br/>Definitely a new and interesting twist -- I thought it was sort of like ""Pulp Fiction"" (out of sequence storyline) meets ""The Usual Suspects"" (ending which calls into question all assumptions made by the viewer since the beginning) meets the book ""Time's Arrow"" by Martin Amis (man lives his entire live in reverse).<br/><br/>After I saw it the first time, there was a strange lingering affect, where for a while afterward, linear time didn't seem quite right to me.  Almost a flashback sort of effect."
"famsmith","9","0","1","17 September 2001"," The Convenience of Memory Loss.
","Typically I choose not to comment on the story and instead focus on the craft of a film.  However, in Memeneto the essence, the distinctiveness, the brilliance, the virtue is in the story itself.  This is the first film in quite some time that I can honestly say I enjoyed purely for the sake of the story- the film itself.  The film has a real starkness to it making the noir comparison obvious, inevitable and quickly a cliche.  The device used in this film is not as straightforward as most people have initially described and it is certainly not a gimmick.  When I think of gimmicks I think of filmic devices, techniques, or methods that are employed only to befuddle the audience and to show off the filmmaker's ability. Therefore this film's device is not gimmicky, the story would be just as interesting without the device.  Of course as some people have already observed this film is not only an implausible one, but an imperfect one, but surely we have made bigger concessions for films in the past.  At the heart of the story is the main character Lenny and his inability to as he puts it to make any new memories. This problem though often comical proves to be simultaneously Lenny's tragedy (making Lenny a very ironic character).  Along with the chaos of a daily life in which he can not remember anything longer than several minutes Lenny is determined to exact his revenge by bringing his wife's killer/rapist because as he puts his inability to remember the act is irrelevant because his wife deserves justice.  Caught up in Lenny's world or perhaps Lenny in theirs are several different characters.  The motel worker that feels sympathy for Lenny, but not enough to keep him from charging him for an extra room because as he puts it business is slow and Lenny won't remember anyway.  The bartender (Natalie) who is caught up in a drug racket and is as quick to use Lenny and mock him as she is to help him.  Their is a particularly frustrating scene which illustrates this, in which Lenny is trying to find a pen so he can remember what she has said.  And of course Teddy who more than anyone pops in and out of Lenny's life.  Unfortunately Teddy is as close to a friend as Lenny gets to have in this story.  A truly interesting aspect of the story is the even more fragmented phone conversations Lenny has in which he reveals Sammy Jankus, a character who Lenny investigated who suffered from almost exactly the same condition Lenny does the only difference is he could not condition his instincts (according to himself Lenny can). As the story of Sammy unfolds we see a subplot that is as intriguing as anyone I can remember in recent film and as integral to understanding Lenny as Freud thinks our dreams are to understanding ourselves.  Unlocking the mystery of Sammy and why it is so important for Lenny to remember him sheds light on the whole situation.  In what is without a doubt the most important scene in understanding Sammy in the film and subsequently understanding Lenny we see that Sammy of course without being aware of it kills his wife as she reminds him at least three times over that she needs her insulin shot and as a result of the failed test she goes into a coma and dies.  So in understanding this scene we fully realize Sammy's problem.  Sammy who ends up in a mental institution and doesn't even realize that his wife is dead, loved his wife very much, but is incapable of saving her because of his mental infirmity.  Lenny's problem is the same, but reversed. Lenny loved his wife very much, but was incapable of saving her and as a result he develops almost the exact same infirmity as Sammy.  Whether Lenny's brain damage is a result of physical trauma (the blow to the head) or the psychological trauma of not being able to deal with the tragedy is arbitrary the condition remains the same.  Still at this point we have yet to fully realize the significance of the connection between Sammy and Lenny.  The connection is fully illuminated for us at the end if we are only paying close enough attention.  When Lenny goes to meet John G. or rather Jimmy Grantz (who Teddy has set up for a fall) Lenny asks, ""You Jimmy Grantz?""  Jimmy dryly replies, ""You expectin any other Jimmies out here memory man? (An obvious reference to Lenny's condition, but the only one in their conversation.)  After Lenny has done away with Jimmy he begins to feel guilty and thinks that perhaps he has killed the wrong man.  And here is the kicker he makes a statement that essentially says that he (Jimmy) knew about Sammy, how did he know about Sammy?  He even brings it up to Teddy when he arrives on the scene, but the fact is Jimmy never said anything to Lenny about Sammy or Sammy's condition, the only reference he made was to Lenny's condition. Sammy regardless of whether he is real or not is Lenny's alter ego, a personality that he has constructed and conditioned himself to remember so that he can deal with the situation.  The dream about Sammy's inability to save his wife when she puts him to the test is really a dream about Lenny's own guilt.  As Teddy points out later it is quite irrelevant whether Lenny's wife was a diabetic or not although she may have been.  The important points are (Most of which Teddy makes to Lenny) he doesn't know who he is only who he was, that Sammy in his condition will never be able to reconcile the guilt he feels over his wife's death, and that Lenny's memory while failing him in the short term has permanently failed him, in the long term it has shielded him- for what is there for Lenny to do once he has exacted revenge and brought this animal who killed his wife to justice?  Tragically and perversely what Lenny has conditioned himself to is revenge.  Revenge is what gives his life meaning, hope, purpose.  The revenge is never as sweet as he imagines and Lenny goes on conditioning and even manipulating his own mind so that he may remember those things he wishes to and forget those which he does not want to remember.  Never is this more obvious or conscious than at the end when Lenny's latent desire fully manifests itself.  In this final scene not only has he become aware of what he has been doing, not only has he accepted it, but he in fact rather enjoys it.  Why else would he choose to completely ignore it?  A man that truly wants to solve his wife's murder- to bring her killer to justice doesn't choose to completely rule out the possibility that he may have already done so, and at least makes a note of it so he can seriously investigate. Lenny if he really wanted to bring the killer to justice and resolve the situation would have raised those questions in a way that made sense and sought to answer them.  Lenny wants to be the searcher, the mourner, the vengeful husband he likes playing that role and telling those stories, it is only this that could fulfill him. Teddy says towards the end (at which point in filmic time he is still alive although in our memories if they have served us correctly tell us he is a dead man.) says, ""Lenny you're not a killer that's why you're so good at it.""  Don't be fooled.  Remember he wanted to forget.  Does Lenny truly feel guilty later?  Sure, but rather conveniently he can't remember why."

Watching it a second time, I was able to catch (one of?) its near subliminal tricks, which pretty neatly confirmed what I'd concluded by the end of the first viewing. There's a minor incorrect detail: insulin is never even occasionally injected into a vein.  If I'm nit-picking, it's because otherwise I could find nothing to criticize.

","The problem I have with Memento is that there's no point of reference.  It's told from the point of view of someone who is unhinged, so you don't know if what you've seen is true.  Kinda like Diary of a Madman.  But there's no place in the film where you say, ""Oh, yeah,  Now I can draw a correlation between these two points"".  As for it's being told backwards, I think it's being told upside-down and sideways.  It's been compared to The Usual Suspects, but I'll be damned if I know why.  When I saw that film I rewound it to see if I had been tricked, and, like The Sixth Sense, I hadn't.  If a film is non-linear, that doesn't make it a great film.  Form over substance does not a good film make."

","It is a very twisted plot but very unique and very well written, usually in a movie you have a general mood with a bit of a second variety, i.e. in a romantic comedy you would get a lot of happy and a little sad etc. In movies like magnolia, you are bombarded with feelings, you get happy, bored, sad, excited, stressed...... you get in it, the same with memento; it is a head rush, but better than magnolia, different sort of genre altogether.<br/><br/>If you watch it on video don't stop, forward or rewind the first time, you will lose all point, please, even if you don't get it,<br/><br/>i can't say more it will ruin it, but you have to see it. it isn't as mainstream as it sounds, the story and the editing were magnificent, perfect even, and i personally liked how you really get in the mood, even annoyed at times, it is rare when a film can get that effect, when they want it to happen, ha ha, It is one of those films where you sit and rethink it after, what it meant or how each different person saw it or what you really saw.

","Its rare to see such an expertly crafted thriller as Memento.  The protagonist suffers from a short-term memory loss condition, causing the events of his life to be mixed, scrambled, and immediately forgotten.  He must write himself notes, take pictures of people he's supposed to remember, and tattoo himself with facts to remember.  Its a remarkable concept.<br/><br/>The question the whole way through Memento is whether or not the film can live up to its concept.  The film is shown from its ending scene to its beginning, making it even more puzzling to watch.  The viewer has to give their full attention to Memento, or else they won't have any clue as to what's going on, but it can be rewarding to those who picked up on most of it.  Memento is a one-of-a-kind experience that is so mystifyingly confusing that you'll enjoy getting lost in it. <br/><br/>O  O  O  O  O  O  O  O<br/><br/>(Very Good)"

","Prepare for a movie experience like no other when watching this film.  Memento tests your mind as much as any other film as the mind of the character on screen is revealed to you.  The events in the film take place backwards; making this suspense not a who-done-it, but instead what events led to this outcome.  One neat feature I would like to see now that I've seen the film the way it is originally shown, and the way all should watch it, is to watch it in chronological order and to see how things unfold that way. <br/><br/>Anyway, the fact that this movie came out so early could hurt its chances but this movie should win a few Oscars (pending any more great films)."

","It is unfortunate that the majority of people who voted negatively for  this film are also the ones most confounded by it. Your inability to grasp the nuances of a particularly complex plot should not reflect on the film, but on yourself.<br/><br/> Yes, some might call this film contrived or 'gimmicky', but that is typically a knee-jerk euphemism for ""I've been tricked, I fell in the trap, I can't figure it out and it's not my fault."" This film isn't perfect, as no film truly can be, but it is one of the most fascinating  endeavors to twist narrative, continuity and subjectivity. One reviewer suggested that the actual story would be quite dull if it were edited in typical narrative fashion. Well, no s**t. Because it is reversed does not mean it is not a typical 'narrative'. What it  manages to do is create incredible tension and suspense while allowing the viewer to know what has already happened. How many scripts could pull that off? Of course the story would be less interested told in real time, that is the whole point!<br/><br/> Excellent performances, etc. etc.<br/><br/> Ten stars for originality, intelligence and production. 0 stars to the dull-minded folk who resist any challenge greater than ""Jurassic  Park III."""

","Perhaps ""Memento"" is just a narrative trick after all. The trick works though. From the opening sequence, the viewer dives into a world of mystery and leaves much of the interpretation up to the spectators. In a year featuring dud after dud, a film like this restored my hope in entertaining film-making. Christopher Nolan (the director and screenwriter), along with the editor and actors deserve all the kudos for giving the public a film, which is entertaining and actually requires effort. When so many movies (""Jurassic Park III"", ""Tomcats"", etc.)  are having the audience leave their brain at the door, this is one notable exception. The performances are all first-rate, but the story is the star here. The film plays with narrative structure and has many scenes, moments and images which refer back to others. This film, like ""The Usual Suspects"", will have you coming back again and again to see what you missed before. A 10 out of 10."

","Memento makes me regret not having seen Following (his previous film) - yet.<br/><br/>Memento is a very clever thriller about a man without a short term memory, who tries to find and kill the killer of his wife. It's also a film about trust. What should you trust; your subjective memory, or the proof of evidence you photographed and put down on paper? Since, the main actor doesn't have a short term memory, the last thing is what he relies on.<br/><br/>
The film is shown backwards. Not that people walk balkwards, but they start with the last scene, play it, move back to the second last scene, and this way go back to the beginning.<br/><br/>Starting at the end, is starting at the moment that his wife's killer is killed. But how did he find out that this was the killer. Especially without a short term memory which makes him forget everything that happened since his wife's death. And how did he get his injury. And who are all the people he meets on the way? You will find out (will you) at the end (or is it the beginning?) of the movie. You hope at least.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is the first half, where you just watch with amazement that the movie really works! And that the puzzle that is shown in the beginning is at the same time unravelled, but also getting more complex.<br/><br/>
The second half of the movie, just discover that things are not as simple as they seem. And you ask yourself: do I still get it or not. I won't tell you the end, but it left me and others in complete confusement. And outside, unlocking our bikes, I could see many people with a puzzled look on their face wondering what really happened? I guess you do have to see it twice (like many of the reviews said) to find out if the puzzle fits, and if it does, how it fits.<br/><br/>Very worthwhile seeing!"

","I just watched Memento, and I am practically speechless. So many times before I have seen movies where a new concept or style is introduced, but the movies only quality is that it tried something new. Memento, however, was a great movie to start out with, and had the bonus of a new concept for a story line and a unique, new, and refreshing way of telling the story. The story is told backwards. The end of one scene ends up being the begining of the scene that preceded it. So, unlike any other mystery, in Memento you know the ending yet strive to know the begining. One line in the movie states something along the lines of how memories cannot really be trusted. Only facts can be trusted. Interestingly, at the end as you try to piece everything together, you realize that you have to trust your memory to figure it out. I don't know if the creators of this film meant for this irony to exist, but if they did, then all the more admiration and respect to them. I rarely ever give a movie a 10 rating, but I made the exception in this case. See this movie. Trust me. It is worth more than the rental price. You usually take a chance when you rent an independent film. Memento is worth that chance and more. Remember, if you can, to see this film."
"forehead1","8","0","1","11 September 2001"," Terrific original movie
","After a summer of so many disappointing cinema ""Blockbusters"" the film I enjoyed most over the warmer months happened to be a video, watched in the comfort of my own home.<br/><br/>After spotting it in my local Blockbusters (how ironic!) I remembered a generous review I'd read a few months back and decided to give it a whirl. It was the best decision I made all summer.<br/><br/>I won't go into details on the plot of the film (there's plenty of others on here already) but I will say this: Memento is the most original, intelligent film I have seen in a long long time.  The 'reverse' narrative might not be for everyone (if you found it too difficult to follow you are obviously too stupid to be watching films like this) but it was a new idea that worked perfectly with the story line involved.<br/><br/>When I started to watch it I saw Teddy had been shot and realised the plot was to unfold from there; I thought: ""Hmmm, interesting idea - but it won't keep me interested"".  How wrong I was.  The movie flows perfectly throughout and the writing and directing ensures you are permanently engrossed from start to finish.  The beginning creates the illusion that you know what is coming, but this is quashed as the plot starts to unfold and you realise that even though you have seen the outcome: you have no idea what is coming next.  I felt that without the slightly weak end to the film (well, beginning of the story :-)) this would have made it into my all-time greats list.  As it is, I gave it a 'very good' rating of 8/10.<br/><br/>However, seeing as this particular style of non-linear narrative is unlikely to be reproduced often, Memento could well go down in history as one of the 'classics'."

If you aren't willing to take the time to appreciate it, please don't see it... you'll just be the next person on here writing about how you hated it.<br/><br/>The constant in this movie is the inconsistancy of Leonard Shelby's mind, it's ""short-termed-ness"", and regression.

It is not impossible to piece together, but it does take some after viewing effort to put it all together.  How brilliant that at first afterthought we might be as confused about the goings on as the main character!  As many others have said, the film puts you in his shoes, and it's amazing!

I dont know if I've ever seen anything like it. The moral philosophy and metaphysics in this film is amazing- Ranging from, do we exist without our memories, to, does anything have a consequence if you cant remember it-is killing really wrong if you dont know you did it? Does the world stop when you close your eyes? Then there is the psychology journey into Leonard Shelby's mind. This aspect of the film is amazing. Who is the real antagonist? When you watch it again-notice how witty Carrie-Anne Moss is when she steals all of the pens before putting on her ""performance"" which was well planned! It makes one think-is this man simply at the mercy of everyone else? Teddy certainly has made him into his own robot (or ""Terminator""). Leanord remembers love-he ""cant remember to forget"" his wife. All in all the acting is sensational, the script revolutionary and ingenious, and the film leaves you walking away thinking about your own life and world - ""we all distort memories.""

As we watched it, we felt a bit of what the Lenny must have felt; out of touch with reality, confused and straining for a clue as to where we were in the story. He had tattoos, notes and Polaroid's and we had previous scenes to piece together. It's almost as if you are part of the story :) It unfolds so beautifully.

","First, about the movie: the way it is told, backwards, is a perfect way to get people drawn into Leonard's condition.  You have the same sense as he does of there being no past, just the future.  Brilliant techinique, creating a movie that you have to think about.  More of this stuff and less standard Hollywood-style braindead entertainment, pleaaase!<br/><br/>
******** PLOT SPOILER ********<br/><br/>Me and my girlfriend were kind of miffed at first, since we thought the ending just left things hanging... but when you think about it, it actually makes perfect sense.  Our interpretation is that:<br/><br/>Sammy Jenkins did exist, and he did kill his wife. Leonard's condition is real. The reason he knows he has his condition is the tattoo of ""remember Sammy Jenkins"" on his hand. Always, when he wakes up, he is utterly disoriented.<br/><br/>He did kill the man who killed his wife, maybe a year ago.  Teddy helped him do it, probably. Since then, Teddy has been using Leonard as a killing machine, getting rid of people for him.<br/><br/>To give meaning to his life, Leonard refuses to keep the proof that he killed his wife's murderer.  With that mission accomplished, he has nothing to live for, and that is too painful.  So he keep inventing new clues, moving to new cities, and looking for new John Gs to kill.<br/><br/>
If you think about it, why does he just jot down Teddy license plate and get it tattooed on him, instead of just writing ""kill him"" on the back of Teddy's photo?  This way, he ensures that he has something to keep him occupied for the next week or so, as he tracks down Teddy.  Probably, he has lived his entire life since the condition began Ã­n this fashion.<br/><br/>
He has a routine that is used to keep him going, and that routine rests on hunting for the man who murdered his wife.  So he needs to keep that hunt going on. In a way, the movie is about the old question of what keeps a man motivated to stay alive and keep going. When you have no memory to live for, you have to live for tomorrow. And then you need some ultimate goal which cannot be achieved, since once you achieve it, life will be over.  It is a very interesting look at the human condition!<br/><br/>Actually, considering other interpretations that say that Leonard and Sammy Jenkins is the same man, that he killed his own wife, and that his condition was mental, does not really matter.  In a way, what came before his memory loss is of no importance to the current situation.  Look at the movie as a study of a strange mental condition, and you can enjoy it, regardless of the ultimate interpretation of what is going on. After all, the memories are not important, right?"

At least it aims for some creativity in this post-modern age -- even if it swipes from Seinfield and Fight Club and Usual Suspects et al. If you liked this film, I recommend checking out Jonathan Lethem's book ""The Vintage Anthology of Amnesia"". It'll make you aware that this film very purposely plays into the idea of introducing a black spot in the text itself -- there's things going on vis-a-vis character relations that aren't entirely cashed out. Which is, of course, fascinating from an amnesia fiction point-of-view. In fact, if people do complain about the contradictions within this film -- I almost thing that these contradictions are *deliberate*. I'm not sure how I feel about them, but I can respect the fact that Christopher Nolan seems to be actually paying homage to an overlooked facet of American fiction -- the amnesic text -- by actually placing blank spots into the text. Which, to me, is intreguing."

","Memento (2001) NewMarket Pictures<br/><br/>1 Hr. 37 Mins.<br/><br/>Starring: Guy Pierce, Joe Pantoliano, Carrie-Ann Moss<br/><br/>Directed by: Christopher Nolan<br/><br/><br/><br/>
'Memento' is the ultimate cinematic brainteaser. Never before have I had to concentrate so intensely on a film than before this little 4.5$ million gem directed by Christopher Nolan. Guy Pierce stars as a memory induced widower seeking revenge on his wife's killer. The only problem is that Pierce's character; Leonard Shelby suffers from a cognitive condition that has him suffer from extreme short-term memory loss called anterograde memory.<br/><br/>Shelby cannot recall anything that happens for more than 10 minutes and therefore tattoos his notes to his body and carries with him Polaroid pictures of those close to him on his route to finding the killer.. The public must be warned though, this is not a conventional Hollywood crime drama. This film is a testament to pure cinema. Here are some tips to decipher and to enjoy the film.<br/><br/>In order for a filmgoer to truly admire this film, one must sit and give this 97-minute 'joy-ride' a chance to unroll before one's very eyes. The film contains several technical elements that quickly differentiate this film from any other film in recent memory. First and foremost, this film regresses before the audience. It starts at the end and works its way backward to the beginning of the plot; along with some black and white crosscut segments that provide subliminal clues to the film's major plot points. This style allows the viewer to actually think in a film instead of basically watching for 'eye-candy'. Furthermore, it is a character driven film that will take a whole lot of concentration to familiarize oneself with these characters. These are not two -dimensional characters but characters that carry this film into a different direction with every scene that transpires before our very eyes.<br/><br/>It also will take at least 15 minutes for the viewer's adaptability to be created for this bold and fundamentally interpretive film. It is certain that not everyone will appreciate and admire this kind of filmmaking, yet it is another 'indie' film that will revolutionize contemporary Hollywood Cinema (Anyone remember Pulp Fiction?) It is by far one of the most confusing, mind-boggling yet thoroughly entertaining films that has crept up on us in recent memory.<br/><br/>Director Christopher Nolan has created a breakthrough film that will require multiple viewings. These viewings will aid the viewer to organize this film in a linear fashion in the viewer's mind in order to decipher the sequence of events that keep us so engaged in this film. I will expand on this point later on, yet I must first also discuss the minute cast that brings this film forward into a different level.<br/><br/>Guy Pierce as aforementioned is a mentally unbalanced widower who can easily be sympathized with (Careful: analyze everything) and 'The Matrix' costars Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Ann Moss make up this threesome of actors who catapult this film to a must-see category. Pantoliano stars as Teddy, a mysterious friend who seems to pop up at all the right places at the right time. And then there is the lovely and talented Moss who stars as a drug dealer's abused girlfriend turning for help to Shelby. The beauty of these characters is their seemingly simplistic characterizations, yet after a much closer and analytical look - their sheer beauty is in their complexity. View the film and understand what I am attempting to convey. There is definitely 'more than meets the eye'.<br/><br/>If anything, some will be displeased at the final result after all this praise. Yet, I ask this? When was the last time that you viewed a film in which there was no clear-cut conclusion? And without giving too much away, when was the last in a film that the actual perpetrator was not of importance? This is the greatness that is 'Memento' - a film that tackles the inner demons of a man who is seemingly trying so hard to please himself at the expense of others. As mentioned before, this film will be open to debates and discussions for viewings to come concerning its' resolution (or lack thereof); yet keep one point in mind. You can tell this film is so great simply due to the level of excitement and discussion it arises within every avid filmgoer. When was the last time you felt that anxiety through a film?<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: ***"

","After reading about it, I had to wait almost two months for Memento to appear in my area.  It was worth the wait and every bit of anticipation that came with it!  Original story, amazing direction, and subtly understated acting made it one of the best movies in recent times.  I felt like I WAS Leonard, confused and wondering what the heck was going on.  Hats off to the writer/director combo!"
"Twillhead","8","0","1","9 September 2001"," The Blessings of Continuity . . .
","... and the bewildering nightmare of life without it--therein lies the crux of `Memento', a quietly brilliant film by Christopher Nolan. The film's opening credits, set over the image of a Polaroid photograph in the reverse process of developing itself, indicates the way the story will unfold--backwards. The cast is filled with first-rate actors, headed by Guy Pearce in a mesmerizing performance as Leonard Shelby--driven, tormented, with a sallow, haunted visage that is maintained throughout the film--who suffers from a rare medical condition which has robbed him of short-term memory. He is on a relentless quest to find and kill the man who attacked and murdered his wife, and who is responsible for Leonard's memory malfunction. The ""rub"" is that Leonard can't possibly remember the identity of the assailant. Leonard is only able to track him down by the use of Polaroid photos scribbled with reminders, a few odd post-it notes, and, most chillingly, by tattooing clues to his body, including a constant reminder of the reason for his mission, emblazoned backwards across his chest, readable only by use of a mirror. (An aside: `We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are', says Leonard at the end of the film--but the film's question to the audience seems to be: what does that mirror reflect? And can we always believe in the truth of that reflection?) While some may find the vigilante aspect of the main character abhorrent, the audience's empathy for Leonard is gained by the poignancy of his plight. In one heart-wrenching scene, Leonard, while burning some of his wife's belongings, wonders if he has ever similarly disposed of her things before and thinks: `I can't remember to forget you.' `Memento' is an astonishing homily about guilt and vengeance (and is vengeance ever really attainable?), manipulation and betrayal, and the lies we often force ourselves to believe when we fall into our own self-inflicted episodes of short-term memory.  NOTE: Those with short-attention spans need not apply! This film demands from its audience absolute attention from beginning to end."

","What a superb film.  It's nice to see all the guys from 1997's 'L.A. Confidential' go on to have their own film masterpieces three years in a row.  First Kevin Spacey with 'American Beauty' in 1999, Russell Crowe in 'Gladiator' in 2000 and now Guy Pearce in 'Memento' in 2001.  It's almost impossible to describe this film without giving away the end but its dreamlike power reeled me in and gave me chilling reminders of Coppola's 1974 classic 'The Conversation' in the way some of the macabre elements played out quickly, sharply and figuratively.  Pearce is totally convincing in his role and Joe Pantoliano plays his part with his usual character actor ambiance intact.  With short scenes, pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle, and not revealing its meaning until the final 30 seconds of the film, 'Memento' is the best film of 2001 so far and it better get raves come Oscar time, or else!"
"Mrobbins21","10","0","1","5 September 2001"," SEE IT AGAIN...YOU MAY HAVE MISSED SOMETHING
","This movie is without a doubt one of my favorites of all time.  I saw it twice at the theatres b/c different groups of friends wanted to go.  It turns out each time I've seen it, I discover something new.  Blown away by Pierce's portrayal of Leonard Shelby.  He and Joe Pantoliano have a great chemistry that is not forced upon you.  Here's the thing though, I picked up the DVD yesterday (it came out yesterday 9/4) and watched it again with my buddy who hadn't yet seen it.  I saw two things I had never seen the first time.  Make sure you watch it with someone who has seen it b/c they can help you if you need it.  DO NOT LET ANYONE SPOIL THE ENDING FOR YOU.  If you like movies with interesting twists such as The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, or the Sixth Sense, than Memento is one that you should not miss. Hopefully Pierce will be recognized for an Academy Award nomination.  By the way, for those who will be seeing it for the second time, watch Sammy Jankis very, very closely in the mental ward. Weird effect that I didn't notice the first two times in the theatre.  Carrie Anne Moss also gives a quality performance.  Needs to break out of the shadow of the Matrix and this may help.  Great film, excellent plot, wonderful acting...I can tell why it's #11 all time according to IMDB voters.  One of the few movies I gave a 10 to.  Watching it tomorrow night with my girlfriend who has never seen it....Maybe I'll see something new."

","Wonderfully conceived, flawlessly executed ""whodunnit"" will challenge your perception and your intellect.

Pearce and Moss are palpable and quite effective, as is the always dependable Pantoliano as the shady supposed 'friend' of Pearce's character. This is definitely one where the viewer can't afford to look away from the action for a second. Not for those with short attention spans."

","The most inventive and cleverly put together movie since Pulp Fiction, maybe even more creative than that!  An all around great movie that keeps you guessing.  Real twists around every corner, unlike such dull movies as ""UNBREAKABLE.""  Memnto truly is exciting, makes you think indepth. Memento, is about a man who is attacked in his home, leaving his wife dead, and his short term memory lost.  He is totally unable to make knew memories, which makes his pursuit to avenge his wife's death a little difficult to say the least.  The only way he can remember his leads, is to tattoo them on his body, and trust a few people, by using a polaroid camera and take their pictures.  In order not to give anything vital away, I must stop now!  See the movie!"
"acebannister","10","0","1","4 September 2001"," True creation.
","A polaroid picture fades before your very eyes.  A tragic story painfully unfolds to you, starting at the end and moving towards the beginning. Memento is a true masterpiece of creativity and masterful acting.  Guy Pearce should make the majority of young hollywood actors feel ashamed of themselves.  Pearce has emerged as a truly exciting and versatile actor that blows almost everyone out of the water.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man suffering from a form of amnesia that doesn't allow him to retain memories.  Thus, he wakes up every morning unaware of what has happened to him previously.  He can only recall memories from the time before he contracted his condition.  All Leonard knows is that he is in search of the man who has raped and killed his wife.  He has tattooed everything he knows about this man to his body so as not to forget. The story proceeds in reverse chronological order, which works because Leonard can't tell how time is progressing anyway, due to his amnesia. Leonard meets many people on his journey, but who can he trust.  Many people are intent on taking advantage of Leonard due to his lack of memory (the motel manager who charges Leonard for two rooms).  Many people are not what they seem to be.  Is Leonard what he seems to be?  Will the story end how you expect?  No.  Memento had me guessing the whole time.  Right when I thought I knew ""the secret"" the story would twist around and I would be left in complete awe.<br/><br/>The movie also stars Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne-Moss.  Who both do great jobs, especially Pantoliano.  Memento is a movie that everyone should see, a gem in a sea of tired Hollywood stories.  Christopher Nolan has shown that he can direct a truly new and creative movie.  See it now."

What I am unsure about and maybe someone could clarify is if Memento will be in contention for the 2002 Academy Awards. The film was released in 2000, but it wasn't released in the US until 2001. This is the best film of the new millennium and will instantly become a classic. It has best picture written all over it with the fascinating script, acting, and direction."

","That's why you should see Memento if you haven't already. Outside of that I don't feel like I can talk more about it, or we end up in spoiler country. All in all, I loved the energy and the predicaments. <br/><br/>But I digress. So I really felt I could have used a shot of Ginko. Your brain is constantly churning information and rebuilding the memories. I've thought about it and for me it's not that it's long, but exhausting. A friend mentioned to me that he thought it was a little long, but still enjoyable.<br/><br/>You can never tell who's lying and who's telling the truth, and that truth is the only thing you can hang onto, even if it's not. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano add significant questionability throughout. Not sure if Keanu could have done it, but probably and that would have rounded off the whole matrix trifecta. Guy Pierce is great in the role, because he's creepy in that likeable kind of way. <br/><br/>Call it living in the moment. It's very weird for someone like me who has bad long-term memory and amazing short-term memory. <br/><br/>By now everyone knows the plot or gimmick; the reverse storytelling is complex and very jarring. The only question was one of execution and I have very little complaints about that. It's difficult to review because it's one of those movies I knew I would probably like anyway. <br/><br/>I finally saw Memento and was impressed from the get-go."

I think Christopher Nolan deserves a Best Director Oscar nod for his excellent direction of this film. Guy Pearce deserves a Best Actor nod for his performance.  Memento also contains some of the best film editing I have seen in years.  I think this movie will probably end up getting at least three to ten Oscar nominations.

","***FILLED WITH SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I am sick of hearing people say that the premise of the film doesn't make sense.  It makes perfect sense if you actually watch the ending.  I'll lay it out really simply and slowly:<br/><br/>Leonard has this condition, he can't creat new memories.  He knows this because he has a tattoo that tells him to 'Remember Sammy Jankis.' Throughout the film, Leonard tells us about Sammy.  Sammy also couldn't create new memories, but Leonard proved that it was a mental problem, not a physical one.  Sammy's wife decided to test him with her life.  He continues to inject the insulin in her until she dies.<br/><br/>So the big question is, how does Leonard know that he has this problem?<br/><br/>
Now, here's the important part.  Sammy never existed!!!  It was Leonard who killed his wife by injecting the insulin.  Leonard's condition is a mental, not physical, problem.  He created the persona of Sammy Jankis and the rape and murder of his wife by John G in order to deal with what he had done. It's all in his head!  That is why he knows he has the condition.  That is why the plot hole does not exist.  And that is why this is an incredible film.<br/><br/>Sure, I was wondering about that very question as I was watching the film. But, seeing as I paid attention to the end, the question was answered.  I didn't just sit there thinking, ""I'm so smart, the filmmakers are stupid. This is a bad movie because there's a plot hole.""  Let me pose some questions to these people who think that this film is dumb and over rated:<br/><br/>Do you consider the original Planet of the Apes stupid because the apes speak English, yet they are on a different planet?<br/><br/>Is Se7en a dumb movie because the killer left a couple sins off the list?<br/><br/>Is Kiss the Girls a lousy pice of cinema because we never find out who the real kidnapper is?<br/><br/>If you answered yes to any of these questions, please go on to one more question:<br/><br/>What's it like not being able to stay awake past the one hour mark in a movie theater?"

            I first heard about this film when it sprung out of nowhere into Jonathon Ross's 'Best Film of the Year' event at number 5. He used the words 'low-budget', and only one scene was shown, and a very badly chosen one at that. (The cafeteria scene with the brilliant Carrie-Ann-Moss) It didn't catch my attention much for these two reasons, hence it was bad marketing.<br/><br/>            I then forgot almost instantly about it, until it then, about 6 months later it popped into the IMDB at number 12. (No mean feat when you look what it's up against!) I then saw a better trailer for it, where it showed parts of the first 'reverse scene', where the gun flies backwards into Guy Pearce's hand, and instantly wanted to see it.<br/><br/>            I had heard that the film had gotten a limited release, and being out here in Germany, with an equally limited variety of new films, I thought I wouldn't see it for ages. The next day I noticed that my local rental store was closing down, and at my lunch break, went over there to see what was selling. Hiding in a corner towards the back, was Memento. For 20 Deutsche Mark's ! (6 pounds, 10 dollars) Of course I rushed home to grab some money, and came late back to work, but hey, once you've seen the film, and understand my position, it was worth coming late for.<br/><br/>
            I watched it once, and was impressed with its originality, and at how clever the middle scenes were, but was somewhat dazed about the end. Only now, after a second viewing, can I say that I understood it all. I know who was good and bad, and who strayed into both categories. Only real brainboxes with IQ's higher than the length of this film would understand it all the first time. Many people will claim to have understood it as they casually walk out of the cinema, but 80% of them will be lying.<br/><br/>             I think the point I am trying to get at, is that this is a 'MUST see twice within a month film', for the ultimate viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>             Every scene begins a mystery, but then once it has backtracked to familiar ground there is a very strange feeling of satisfaction.<br/><br/>
            This certainly deserves to be at number one of any top 10 list, see it now, and if you already have, you probably haven't understood it, so see it again.<br/><br/>AND THIS ISN'T FOR ANYBODY WITH SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS THEMSELVES !"

","Memento is one of those rare treats of a film that only comes along once in a blue moon (Include Fargo, Pulp Fiction, and The Usual Suspects). It's not only a stunningly tragic thriller, it has an amazing emotional core that provides balance for the film. Consider the way Leonard talks about his wife at the restaurant, then when he is unable to sleep.<br/><br/>Director Christopher Nolan's brother Jonah actually wrote Memento as a short story, Christopher then adapted it, and he did a fantastic job. Memento has a great screenplay. Nolan gets us involved in what's going on as far as plot (or, actually, what has already gone on in the plot. Whatever.) and he inter-cuts the black and white sequences with perfect placements. They serve as a bridge for what's coming up next, or before. But then, he also knows that there needs to be some sort of bond between the audience and Leonard, so he gives us these short little snippets of Leonard's personal life, his sadness, his lonliness.<br/><br/>In terms of theme, I think the film has many. (WARNING: SPOILERS!!!) The movie deals, of course with revenge. To me that was the focus. How revenge will eventually leave you unsatisfied and unfulfilled. Then, there is the observation that sometimes we force ourselves into believing something just because we want to feel like we are important. We want to have purpose. And when faced with the truth, Leonard lies to himself to feel that importance. Then there are the smaller more subtle thoughts about loss, and sadness, which I found very moving.<br/><br/>Every single actor in this movie was perfect. Guy Pearce is just wonderful at film-noir. Look at his breakthrough in L.A. Confidential, and his very entertaining and highly fascinating movie, Ravenous, about cannibalism and carnage. He's just a very fine actor. And the characters of Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano (who is just hysterical) give the movie an even more mysterious feeling. The way we see their pictures and we see what's written on them and immediately wonder, ""When was that written? I want to see Leonard write that. I can't wait to understand how all of this fits together.""<br/><br/>This is not a movie you just watch once and then forget about. I've seen it three times, and I own the screenplay, and I'm still not sure I have it all figured out. I can assure you, you will be thinking about this movie long after it ends, trying to figure things out, trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together. I think that just makes the film even better."

","Quite simply, I've not been so intriqued by a film in a long while.  This is THE film of 2001, no questions about it.  It forces you to go back to view again. MAJOR SPOILERS First - we must understand the facts of the film.  We can argue all we want. People will have their own versions.  But the version below is a correct account of parts of the movie whether you like to believe it or not:<br/><br/>Catherine Shelby was raped.  She did not die.  Leonard kills one of the two home invaders.  Yes, there were two of them.  The other one was NOT imaginary. The other bonks Leonard's head - causing Leonard to sustain short-term memory loss and he gets away.   Catherine recovers.  Some time later, Catherine, frustrated by Leonard's memory loss attempts to snap him out of it.  She does this by administering the Insulin test.  Leonard fails the test.  Catherine die via Leonard's hands.  Leonard knows this, but cannot accept that he has killed her.  He must shift the blame to someone else.  He shifts the blame on Sammy Jankis.  Sammy is a REAL person, not imaginary.  Sammy did not have a wife.  Sammy's story is characterizes Leonard's story.  The exception is that Sammy could not learn through condition/repetition.  Leonard can.  In fact, Leonard conditions himself to believe that his wife died in the attack (which she did not).  He conditioned himself to believe that Sammy's wife (who did not exist) died from insulin.  He effectively shifts the act of him killing his wife onto Sammy.  Also, we must understand that while Leonard has memory loss, it is not 100%.  He CAN remember, but only selectively, and it's what he wants to remember.  For example, he can remember the sequence of fact numbers, and he members Burt's name.  Most importantly, he remembers that he himself has memory loss.  This is core and central to the movie.  Folks, you must understand this - Leonard REMEMBERS that he has partial memory loss. Think about it - if he cannot make new memories after the ""incident"" how then does he understands that he has the condition? Make no mistake about it - he remember things selectively.  When come to grips with this movie, you will understand that Leonard is the real villain in the film.  He chooses to remember things he wants to.  He manipulates his memories to distort the facts.  There is no reason to shed any sympathy for him. In the end, this is not a film about who killed who.  This film challenges us to question the validity of our own memories - how memories can be distorted and changed. Sorry if I upset those who disagree."

","I knew there had to be a deeper explanation to why Guy Pierce, the led actor in ""Memento,"" constantly reminded me of fellow actor Brad Pitt.  Throughout the film, I just correlated this recognition to the shared physical similarities between the two actors - muscular & lean, tan, blond, not an ounce of noticable body fat and drop dead gorgeous.  However, once the conclusion of the movie is revealed (after much anticipation had been built up) - it all proved to be a more deeper meaning for the actor's resemblance to each other. Like in Pitt's ""Fight Club,"" ""Memento"" resolves a highly intriquing tale - full of sweet oblivion - with an unsatisfying ending. The, what I like to call ""Tyler Durden - insanity - cop out"" finale. Simply pinning the suspenseful explanation of a story to the main character just doesn't do it for me.  Let's face it - the ending is too important to ruin - because it's the last thing you remember when you leave the fantasy world.  ""Memento"" had me hooked from the very beginning - all building & building up to a climax I couldn't wait for.  Then - once revealed - it prooved the be the worst part of the whole film."

No, people aren't walking and driving cars backwards, but they show about five minute segments, starting with the end, and then overlapping a little, going backwards in time.  There's a reason for this, because the storyline is about a man who is trying to find his wife's killer.  The problem, however, is  that since the murder, he has ZERO short term memory, so he needs to snap photographs and jot notes to himself to help him the next day, or even the next five minutes.

"lisarull","10","0","1","2 August 2001"," You really will end up thinking ""Now, where was I?""
","Like the best of films with some kind of twisting and demanding plot, ""Memento"" not only warrants second, third and more viewings but actively encourages them.  Like ""The Usual Suspects"" you get to the end and think you have found the answer to what happened, what you have just spent two hours watching, but the more you analyse it the less certain you are.  You really will end up thinking ""Now, where was I?""  Characters' moral ambiguity become clearer with each viewing so that you can end up convinced that everyone in the world is totally messed up and utterly lacking a morality of any real kind.<br/><br/>But it is worth more than one viewing (if you didn't get it the first time, I ain't saying the second will make it all clear, but you should invest the time) if only for the acting performances.  Pearce makes another great screen character come to life off the script (see ""LA Confidential"" and ""Priscilla"" for others), Joe Pantoliano is a creature of demonlike charm, and Carrie Moss - well, what can I say.  Her role as Natalie is pivotal to the audience's realisation that this movie is deliberately playing with their head.<br/><br/>For those who wonder where Nolan appeared from with this great sleeper hit (WHY DID THE USA TAKE SO LONG TO GIVE IT DISTRIBUTION?!!!) seek out his previous movie ""Following"" which offers an equally disturbing and twisting narrative.  Catch it at your arthouse cinema ASAP."

","Few movies, in the last year, have really captured my imagination. With the constant stream of typical, boring movies with nothing but eye candy and a plot so loose and full of holes it's degrading to believe that any real thought went into them (and not just a series of cliches thrown together to make a movie), that I was so ecstatic when Memento was released.<br/><br/>This has been by far my favorite film of recent years. Everything is skillfully arranged. The narration adds a comedic and sometimes sad resonance to the film. The acting was great. Guy Pierce, formally in L.A. Confidential, was so believable and secure in his role as Leonard, that it was hard to imagine he was not experiencing his problematic inability to produce new memories. The movie is filmed in reverse. And of course, that means, the beginning is really the ending. But Memento is so wonderfully written, that even this does not really give away what is going to happen. And it is not this alone that makes Memento such a wonderful movie. The ride through Leonard's life in the past few days is so fun and full of interesting events, that there was never a moment that dragged or left the viewer with any sense that things weren't going somewhere. It is such an entertaining film that though it is a movie full of surprises, knowing them and watching it again does not hinder its ability to absolutely capture its viewer's attention.<br/><br/>Memento is a great film that should be viewed by everyone. It has writing and direction that is well beyond that of any other movie out right now. When this is released on video, I'll be one of the first people to buy it."

","When I first saw the preview for Memento, I thought, ""Wow, what a good cast and interesting concept!""  Then I saw the movie and thought, ""WOW, what a PHENOMENAL cast and INGENIOUS concept!""  The movie is about Leonard, a man with no short-term memory due to a violent ""incident"" in his past, and his search for the man who killed his wife.  To compensate for his very rare and odd handicap, he takes Polaroids of people and places he needs to remember and, for those truly necessary facts, tattoos them upon his body.  This alone would have held my attention throughout the movie, but director Christopher Nolan shoots the movie in segments starting at the end and working its way to the beginning.  Sounds pretentious, but it truly creates an environment where the viewer feels the confusion and struggle that Leonard feels.  This style of editing makes Memento's characters the hardest to decipher of nearly any movie I have seen.  The two main supporting characters are played wonderfully, brilliantly, powerfully, intelligently and eerily by Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantoliano.  Each plays a character with such varying motives and actions that the viewer cannot find the line between truth and manipulation.  The ending is a real kicker(don't worry, I won't spoil it) and I could spend a lot more time talking about this film, but I will leave it at this and simply say, ""One of the year's best...without a doubt!  Kudos to everyone involved with this movie, it rocks!"""

","Don't read if you haven't seen it... possible spoiling involved...<br/><br/><br/><br/>OK, so I just saw this movie a few hours ago. It is still fresh on my mind. It is quite a suspenseful movie. Afterwards my head was spinning... I think it is important to realize what Teddy said is probably true... In the posts I've read everyone seems to forget that Teddy is the police man that did the report on his case. Even though he used Leanard he did know what happened... and he said that Leanard's wife was raped and that she survived. The men that raped his wife did in fact hit Lenny into the mirror, 'causing his brain damage. The question I am not sure of is... Was there really the man that he investigated with the same memory problem or did Lenny completely fabricate that story?? I tend to believe that Lenny did have a memory problem. I'm not so sure that he lied about that too. Although the point that can confuse me is to say that Lenny thought of the memories he had of his wife being diabetic and him giving her insulin. If he had no memory how could he remember that?? I should see it again to maybe grasp it better. Maybe he made up the story of the other guy with the memory loss and his wife was the diabetic. That is more understandable if you can believe Teddy. It is a given that people used Leanard. Wouldn't he have the memory problem if he was unknowingly being used??  I am such the type to want a definate ending. This movie leaves you pondering for sure. What I didn't like about the film was that it makes you feel sorry for Lenny then realize he is a murderer... I rated the film an 8. Good but not perfect. I wonder if renting the movie and watching the end to the begining would help?? It would be difficult. Thanks for reading."
"hprill","10","0","1","30 July 2001"," Wow. Truly Hitchcockian. Brilliant.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Don't read too much about this film - the more you know the less you'll enjoy it. It's all about not knowing too much, you know.<br/><br/>I thought this was the kind of man-who-lost-his-memory tries to find out what happened. I was *very* wrong. Instead, this is man-who-forgets-everything-after-a-few-minutes tries to find and kill the man who killed his wife. The problem is that, having no short-term memory, he has to rely entirely on his notes and polaroids. Still, he succeeds, and in the first second of the movie, actually while the titles are still running, shoots the man.<br/><br/>The remaining two hours are a reconstruction of what happened before. This story is told backwards, so as to make sure the audience never knows more than the man without memory knew at this point. Throughout the whole film you never stop wondering just what happened before, and when that little extra bit of information finally arrives, you're either even more puzzled, completely surprised or you'll find everything is logical. But still you'll want to know what happened before...<br/><br/>Even at the end, when most things seem to be clear, I couldn't stop going through the film over and over again, trying to reconstruct the events. So even after you know what happened, you may want to watch this film again -- I surely did.<br/><br/>Excellent script, excellent acting. Guy Pearce as the man without short-term memory is just brilliant in all his naiveness, obsessiveness and vulnerability. Even better (I think) was Joe Pantoliano as ""Don't believe in his lies"" Teddy. He was just perfect in all his sleaziness, adding wonderfully to Pearce's paranoia.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed by Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie; somehow her character did not seem fully developed. I'm not sure if this was due to the script or just not very enthusiastic acting. The scene where she gets hit seemed particularly weak, she just didn't ring true in that situation.<br/><br/>Editing and photography was perfect, too. The two timeframes (one moving backwards, in color, and one moving forwards, in black and white) may confuse some viewers at first, but as soon as you get the concept, this is no longer a problem and you'll constantly want to know what happened before.<br/><br/>Never since Hitchcock has a movie so perfectly covered a peculiar mental state combined with an obsession ('Vertigo' and 'Spellbound', perhaps also 'Frenzy', come to mind); hardly ever has this be done with such an intriguing technique. The humour, which is mostly deadpan, is also very reminiscent of Hitchcock. Yet this is no pseudo-hommage à la Brian de Palma; this is a very original film.<br/><br/>Again: don't read too much about the plot of this movie before watching it, because the plot is really finding out the plot, and once you've done that, you'll never be able to watch the film again with the same eyes. You *will* want to watch it again however, just to find out what you missed the first time.<br/><br/>Never had such an easy 10/10. This is going to become a classic."

It's really so good that you don't have to ""get it"" to admire the hell out of it.<br/><br/>And, naturally, a good number of those who misunderstand the plot and/or underestimate the story's integrity HATE it.

It's about our boy Lenny fumbling through an impossibly complicated psychological maze until, in a moment of perfect clarity, he concocts a happy ending for himself. It's also about a fascinated Teddy toying for a while with a dangerous freak but ultimately failing to foresee how a human mind might turn its own fatal flaw into an awesome weapon. If you consider Lenny's likely fate after the last scene -- how he will interpret his tatoos and unburned polaroids for the rest of his life (presumably back in the mental hospital) it's clear that Leonard managed to resolve (for himself) the crushing and seemingly impossible dilemma of his own guilt."

","This is something as unique as a film without a memory. By telling the story backwards, the director subjects the viewer to the same loss of memory suffered by the film´s main protagonist. You have no previously etablished data to understand the different events in their narrative sequence: the data needed to understand one scene establishes itself, at least partially, in the next, and so on. This structure puts everything afloat, everything is destabilized: memory, the Other, nothing is given, nothing is safe. Absolute genius! I know a lot of critics will probably say that this is SO Quentin Tarantino (stupid, boring hack if anyone ever was) or Usual Suspects, but it actually manages to do something more than show of it´s coolness and how smart it is; it is more conceptually and philosophically oriented, in a way similar to for example Alain Resnais - his Providence (1977) being a key point here - and THIS is the the stuff greatness is made of.

Guy Pierce must be one of the most under rated actors in Hollywood, as his portrail of a man tortured by lack of short term memory is fantastic.  With more twists than 50's reunion and wicked humour the film is the best thing I have seen in an age.  The scene with Dodds is as thrilling as it is comical.  You must see this film!

","Memento is by far one of the best movies ever made. It is a shame that it was limited to such a small amount of theaters. Finally a movie that actually lives up to the hype. Nothing is as it seems in this movie, and the audience gets to experience exactly what Leonard Shelby does. Plus the fact, that the audience sees everything backwards, only adds to the effect of the movie.<br/><br/>Another great thing about it, is that there was finally a movie, that was not runied by a horrible ending. The ending actually made sense and fit the movie perfectly. This is the best "" who done it"" film I have seen since Usual Suspects. I don't usually see movies twice in the theater, but I am going to see it again as soon as possible.<br/><br/>10 / 10 !!!!"

Every new episode, tracking backwards in time, asks a new question, and not until the end, or the beginning - the answers are revealed.<br/><br/>This is a MASTERPIECE with the extreme cool idea of telling a story backwards, leaving us as unaware of what just happens as it does to Guy Pearce character Lenny. <br/><br/>Whatever you do, don't miss it.

","Memory loss, stick-it notes, tattoos, and polariod photos. These are the things that Leonard Shelby has at his disposal to find the man who raped and murdered his wife. Structured in a reverse order of events, Chistopher Nolan's sophmore effort Memento is the kind of film that will be talked about, studied, and depated for years to come. Memento is the kind of film that at times makes you confused as hell, and then makes you sit back in surprise. Memento is also the kind of film that once you think you have it figured out tears your predictions to shreads. On top of the top notch acting (Pearce, Moss, and Pantoliano all at their best), Memento is driven by your own psychological interest in the plot.

The story is not just great, it's fantastic because it's perfectly directed and edited (sure you re-edit this movie chronologically, you lose a lot of power). Acting is also good (specially guy pearce whose voice perfectly fits in). But there are a bunch of details that makes this movie worth watching a number of times (color of the scenes for instance). I disagree with many comments : the story is not just told backwards, it's also told forwards (B&W scenes) and the end is in fact the middle of the story. But the editing makes it all working and one, two viewing of this movie is just not enough : you must see it once for the end, a second time to understand the ""backwards"" scenes and a third time to include the ""forwards"" scenes in the understanding of this great movie, (scenes you will more or less skip in the first 2 viewings).

","(WARNING: SOME SPOILERS!!!) ...because this is far and away the best movie I've seen this year. If I happen to see another movie that is better than ""Memento"" I will submit myself for public flogging - that's how positive I am that this is the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>Poor Leonard Shelby, magnificently played by Guy Pearce, is on a mission to find ""John G"" the man who raped and murdered his wife (or did he?...dum, dum...) Complicating the search is the fact that Leonard suffers from short-term memory (or does he?...dum, dum...) and can't remember conversations that took place or people he has met, and needs photos to remind him of what the heck is going on.<br/><br/>Oh, did I happen to mention the movie runs backwards, providing a stark difference to standard H-Wood fare. And, to be 100% truthful, I don't think the movie would work if it were run straight-forward. Seeing it backwards made me feel as if I were putting a puzzle together without having use of my hands. It was challenging and exhilarating to try and figure out what was going on and forced me to pay attention. At least 95% of the movies I go to, I daydream, look at my watch, etc. This was not one of them - that's how much this movie impressed and challenged me.<br/><br/>Admit it, you got a chill up your spine when Leonard is talking on the phone, looks down at his leg and sees the phrase ""NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE"" - stops talking, and we, the audience, feel Leonard's fear.<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into what I think happened (okay, I think Leonard is faking because he feels badly that he didn't believe Sammy, there I said it, those who disagree with me can disagree with me if they choose) - but everyone I've talked to about this movie has added a fresh perspective as to what they think happened, and everytime I talk to someone different it gives me points to ponder. It says something about a movie that you can talk to ten different people as to what they saw and you will get ten different versions/stories, and ALL of them are valid arguments for what really happened.<br/><br/>I haven't been this hung up on a movie since ""L.A. Confidential"". Pearce deserves an Oscar nomination (and if he doesn't get it I say we all storm AMPAS headquarters, or just camp out at voters homes), and Joe Pantliano (sp?) and Carrie-Ann Moss are equally stunning....the script is tight, the directing is superb, and..uh..sorry guys, I'm off to see ""Memento"" again...."

I agree that it would be just an average movie if told forwards; I think that's part of the point.  Seeing it through the eyes of a man with no short term memory is what's really interesting.  I think if it was told forwards it would've been more of a comedy; everything's being spelled out for Leonard but he can't remember a thing.  We'd probably feel like most of the other characters feel.  As it is, we're just as confused as Leonard, and it's great.  This was a blissfully original movie; I give it a 10."

How can a movie that is told backwards be good if you know the ending first? Trust me, it can be since the ending is a beginning to the puzzle of Lenny.  I want to rave about this film, but I don't even know where to start.  All I can say is that it is a shame that this movie did not receive the attention it deserves or the theater play (I had to drive quite a distance to see it) when it is so good, while crap like ""Swordfish"" has commercial spots every 5 minutes.

","This is the kind of film that people want to pick apart, because of its gimmick, and a lot of the posts are revelling in their revealing of mistakes in regard to Leonard's memory (""How could he remember blah blah"" or ""Why didn't he blah blah"").  The problem is, they're missing the point of Teddy's revelation at the end of the movie.  Leonard is insane, not brain damaged. He is like Sammy, the Sammy of both Leonard and Teddy's experience: he does not have a physical disability (like the Sammy of Leonard's experience) AND he is ""faking it"" (like the Sammy of Teddy's experience).  Leonard is insane.  His mind is playing tricks on him; he can remember, he simply choses not to.  That is the power of this film, the haunting quality of his refusal to knowledge it when Teddy tells him, thus, finally, spiralling off into complete madness.<br/><br/>Yes, he could record things better, but he doesn't; he doesn't need to.  He remembers, so tracking things acurately isn't really what its about.  Not recording things well is part of the madness of his delusions.  He harps about Sammy's bad habit of writing notes, getting confused, but this is what he largely does.  Also, in regard to calendars, know, he doesn't keep one, because he doesn't want to:  he wants to be lost in the same repititious day, again and again reenacting his revenge, a revenge, as he himself caused his wife's death, is being meted out upon himself and his sanity."

","It amazes (and amuses) me that people with zero knowledge of neurobiology and psychology can deign to criticize the science of the movie.  Well, take it from someone who just took an advanced undergrad seminar in the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at Harvard (and got an A, too) -- the science in the movie is stone-cold rock-solid.  I've just seen it a second time, and it struck me just how much Leonard emphasizes the role of what cognitive psychology calls ""procedural memory"" (and which Leonard quite reasonably calls ""habit"" or ""instinct"") in explaining why he's as functional as he is.  Procedural memory is spared in even the worst cases of anterograde amnesia caused by medial temporal lobe (hippocampus, etc.) damage.  And there are cases of people with amnesia as bad as Leonard's who are not institutionalized, but who live at home with their spouses and a system of notes and reminders (emphasis on ""system"").<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER . . I also want to chime in on one of the plot points that is much debated.  Near the end of the movie, Teddy tells Leonard that he's lying to himself about something crucial (and, in fact, transferring the memory of what happened to him so that he remembers it happening to someone else.  You know what I'm talking about, right?)  Most people I've talked to regard the question of whether Teddy is lying about this as ambiguous. It's not.  Sure, people misremember things that are too painful to remember accurately, as Teddy claims Leonard has done.  But you have to remember first, before you can misremember.  Had this really happened to Leonard (as Teddy claims) and not someone else (as Leonard remembers), Leonard could have had no motive to transfer the memory -- he would have forgotten the whole incident fifteen minutes later."

","As much as i really wanted to see Memento on the big screen, somehow i missed it and had to wait for video. I found the premise fascinating and intriguing, and couldnt wait to see it. At last, i rented it and got it home to watch, and at first, i have to admit, it was kinda like, 'what...'? The whole backwards thing seemed like it was really going to be an obstacle at first, and i was worried i might not be able to really get absorbed by the film because of this. But, my fears were quelled and i found myself totally getting into the film, and once i got used to the backwards deal, i realised how genius it was. To provide us at the beginning of each scene with only the knowledge that the protagonist, Leonard Shelby, has, and no information about previous events. This way we start the film knowing only what Leonard Shelby knows, and thus allowing us to empathise with his frustration and anguish in his search for the truth. In a way, this divides the film into 3 parts, much like other films such as Reservoir Dogs. In the 1st part, we have little or no knowledge about the characters, so the characters in the film who *are* informed have one up on us. In the 2nd part of the film we learn more, and we actually surpass the level of information of other characters in the film. In the 3rd part, the climax of the film, the remaining characters catch up with us as they learn the truth. This structure gives us a connection with the characters and makes us feel involved in the film. And clever tricks aside, what a genuinely great film! The characters were solid and believable, the actors' and actresses' performances were excellent, the themes of the movie were classic, but not cliche, and i was truly gripped by this film from beginning to end. And the ending (which I'm not going to give away) was completely unexpected (by me at least), but still entirely believable. A must-see, in my opinion, and I'd recommend watching it more than once- there's so much to it that you'll pick up second time around."

","In this stylish thriller noir, British director Chris Nolan delivers a film that is original and intriguing. The films core is based on one man's weakness with his mind. Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is after his wife's killer, unfortunately he is a man who has a rare memory disorder. This leaves him with no short term memory thus highly unlikely to solve the case.<br/><br/>Leonard has tattoos on his body and post it notes stuck to things so he can remember important clues and daily rituals. It is imaginative and original ideas like these which make the film a refreshing experience for anyone who is interested in seeing it. He has friends that want to help him solve the case - Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), although no-one is who they seem and everyone plays an integral part in the story.<br/><br/>
The film does not use traditional narrative..instead it relies on the viewers high level of concentration throughout.<br/><br/>After seeing the film twice I still have ideas in my head and have spent hours analyzing it to come to the conclusion that it is a fresh film that give its cast and crew a lot of potential to do well in the future."

","This is an absolutely brilliant movie. I'm surprised when people compare with ""The sixth sense"" and the like, because this is not a gimmick movie. Having read the comments, I think that most people fail to realize why the story is told backwards. It is not to make an otherwise ""boring"" story more convoluted and hard to follow, but simply to create an impression on how the main character in the movie perceived reality. At the star of every movie snapshot, you have no clue of what has happened before, much in the same way as the main character. It is true that the short term memory loss has been dealt with in other excellent movies like ""Wintersleepers"", but what makes this movie so brilliant is the combination of this ""condition"" with the way the story is told. BTW, the fact that Leonard could remember that he had a short-term memory impairment is not a goof - he knew the illness from before his accident, and he had a tatoo in his arm reading ""remember Sammy Jankis"" to help him remember that. Plus in the final scene we realize that Leonards mental problem was far more complex than it could be have been supposed from the rest of the movie - in this sense there is a ""gimmick"" in the movie, but only insofar as the whole truth is not revealed until the end (the beginning, that is :-)) I give it a 9 out 10 only because I like to save 10 for later."

What's sure is that this is a film to be seen again and again (forwards and backwards).<br/><br/>To see this film backwards, you have to start forwards with the black and white scenes until you reach the end, and then continue backwards with the color scenes.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

","Memento is only the latest example of an excellent movie with NO budget. Unless you think renting a Jaguar car is big budget. This movie looks great & also looks like it had no money to work with. Guy Pierce should definitely get an Oscar nomination - but then so should have Jamie Bell for Billy Eliott. Carrie Moss who exhibited no acting ability in the Matrix and very little in the Sigourney Weaver role in Red Planet - finally gets a chance to prove herself. This movie is a spell binder & definitely one you can't see just once. It's a keeper in an age of movies where expensive junk like The Grinch & A.I. dominate the cineplexes.

","This film rocked my world!  Fantastically well acted and pieced together. The brilliant storyline and plot are accompanied by a subtle soundtrack and cinematography, and I think the word 'understated' sums up Chris Nolan's approach to this film.  He isn't tempted away from the point on his directoral debut.  Managing to successfully include twists in a film that tells it's story backwards is simply genius.  The only thing to say is watch this at least twice, and once you've done that you can watch it and begin to understand. And while your asking yourself ""Where is my mind!?"" then you can book your time down the tatoo parlour!"
"chrisbrown6453","7","0","1","6 July 2001"," Memento, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, uses unconventional narrative and filmic techniques to explore the disoriented mind of its main character.
","Trying to save his wife as she is brutally attacked by a stranger, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pierce: L.A. Confidential) receives a violent blow on the head and experiences brain damage. The trauma results in anterograde memory-loss, a rare disorder defined by the inability to form new memories. An insurance investigator who once trusted his perceptions in order to distinguish between people's false and legitimate claims, Leonard must now cope with a condition that challenges his ability to perceive reality, and which presses him to trust others. Nevertheless, Leonard is driven by a commitment to capture his wife's murderer, for the last memory he does retain recalls the traumatic incident. Relying entirely on written notes, Polaroid snapshots, and tattoos, which tell him --rather than remind him-- what car he drives, what motel he is staying in, what his new confidant ""Natalie"" (Carrie-Anne Moss: The Matrix; Chocolat) looks like, and how to find ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano: The Matrix), his wife's killer, Leonard's fate is determined by<br/><br/>his written data.<br/><br/>Memento clearly establishes the main character's point of view by narrating events as the character perceives them. This is achieved by focusing on the atemporal quality of his experience as he reencounters characters and situations without knowledge --or memory-- of a prior encounter. (That is, since Leonard interprets every encounter as a new one, the viewer often cannot distinguish between a genuinely new encounter and one which the protagonist simply sees as new.) Technically, Memento relies on editing techniques that disorient the viewer with undefinable patterns of flashback and flashforward images. Although often marked by tedious repetition of key scenes, the circular nature of the narration stresses the character's condition and establishes that a lack of memory may result in his inability to apply moral judgment. This raises valuable questions with regards to the role memory plays in the concepts of revenge, motivation and regret. All in all, Memento deconstructs natural perceptions of reality (and entertains new ones) by successfully manipulating its filmatic elements, and by offering a suspenseful story which evolves as a result of its protagonist's abnormal cognitive processes."

","I just saw 'Memento' last night, only hours after reading on imdb.com that the film is ranked number 12 on the top 250 list.  I have to say, despite seeing the film with this preconceived notion of greatness, I was not disappointed. I think the movie's brilliance lies in the fact that it does require such a high level of attention by the viewer.  Viewers who appreciate these types of films will consider 'Memento' as sacred as Christians consider the Bible."

","I'm glad I've lived long enough to see films like this be made.  It restores faith in the idea of film as literature.<br/><br/>The story unfolds in a discontinuous fashion; it is not a traditional narrative.  This is extremely appropriate since the main character suffers memory loss --- one thing doesn't stay connected to another.  To offset this the main character leaves himself reminders to somehow help him to connect.<br/><br/>
On one level it is a murder mystery.  On another level it is an intense first person experience of life distorted by the malady of the main character. On yet another level it is a heroic quest for TRUTH. In his quest the main character intersects with people who have a use for him. As the film ends one may grapple with this thought: There are no absolutes!"

","I enjoyed ""Memento,"" mostly because Guy Pearce was so utterly successful in getting me to buy into his character.  Ultimately, though, this movie relies on a gimmick, much like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" did. Judging by the ratings these movies have garnered from IMDb users, people like these tactics, and are eager for more of the same.  While the 'hook' in ""Memento"" is more credible than those of the other two, it is by no means original.  The idea which permits the reverse-chronology structure to function is that of Pearce having lost his short-term memory and consequently being forced to rely on polaroid snaps and notes to (and on) himself in order to make judgments and plan his days.  Does this ring a bell?  I would suggest any moviegoers who think this was a brilliantly original idea go out and rent Tom Tykwer's ""Winterschläfer"" (""Wintersleepers""), the precursor to his international hit, ""Lola Rennt"" (""Run Lola Run"").  Those who do will see a principal character with the exact same problem and technique (minus the tattoos) for solving it.  Given that ""Winterschläfer"" did the U.S. and international art house and festival rounds, and received quite a number of important awards, it's pretty hard to believe that the Nolans were unaware of it, and happened to come up with identical concept by chance a couple of years later  Don't take my word for it: judge for yourselves."

"jeff_johnston","Null","0","1","3 July 2001"," actually substantial filmmaking or ""cool"" fluff?
","I recently saw this movie with a group of people who just couldn't stop talking about it afterwards. I watched for an hour or two as they tried to riddle out the mysteries of Leonard Shelby's ""condition,"" of his strange trip, and of his connections with his friends. Finally,  I couldn't stand it any more: what relevance, I asked, does any of this have to do to the supposed ""deeper issues"" that the movie half-heartedly attempts to make us believe that it has raised? No one could tell me precisely, but they assured me that, once I'd thought about the plot and figured out what REALLY happened, I would know.<br/><br/>I disagree. I see this movie as the latest installment in Hollywood's latest string of movies which try to sell themselves (and succeed, usually, very well) solely through a thick layer of ""gimmicks,"" that is, tricks of the trade that make a movie look ""cool."" Memento has gimmicks galore: time moves backwards, in clips of a few minutes each; there is a ""frenetic"" and disjointed narration by the main character, repeating key bits of dialogue, mantra-style almost, to drive home his neurotic-ness (which seems to be very cool at the movies these days); there is a confusing plot that's hard to follow; and there is the traditional twist ending.<br/><br/>I challenge those who I can already hear complaining that these aren't ""gimmicks,"" but essential parts of the plot structure, to ask themselves why these things are so essential in the light of what the movie takes to be its central object, memory. First of all: why does the action move backward in time? I could probably come up with some long, convoluted ""film-school"" answer to that question, but it wouldn't be a good one. The best answer seems to be: because it makes the movie look cool, and because it gives the added benefit of giving us a surprise ending. Since it's probably not a very important gimmick, we should imagine what the movie would be like without it; I think most people wouldn't like nearly as much.<br/><br/>While many people are content spending hours trying to figure out Leonard Shelby's shoe size, I personally couldn't care less. What annoys me about films like these is the fact that they're so dishonest; Memento, like Fight Club, American Beauty, and Pleasantville before it, seems, on reflection, to be trying most of all to make people say to themselves, ""wow! what a smart movie"" without actually BEING a smart movie. The few incredibly weak philosophical insights (such as the one at the end of the film) convince people that, buried under the convoluted heap of an impossible-to-follow plot, there's actually something deep and worthwhile. The surprise ending only makes this more blatant; Memento, like so many movies today, is aimed at making the viewer want to see it again in order to ""get it better."" But my suspicion is that there's really nothing to get; even Tom Tykwer's Winterschlaffen (""Wintersleepers""), from which the plot concept for Memento seems to have been lifted, treats the subject better. My suggestion: see an honest movie, one that doesn't need plot twists or obscurity to say something interesting or important, like The Seventh Seal, or a movie that uses plot twists and confusion in an honest and compelling way, like Hitchcock's great masterpiece, Vertigo."

","Okay.<br/><br/>From the moment I heard of this movie, I've read countless reviews that lambasted its unconventional styling, pacing, and storytelling approach. It doesn't adhere to such-and-such set of screenwriting guidelines that've been in place for the better part of a century, it doesn't lead the viewer clearly through the sequence of events, it's not expository enough; it requires too much audience participation to unravel the plot.<br/><br/>Yes, it does.<br/><br/>And I say, so what?<br/><br/>How many acknowledged masterpieces have been hit with the same criticism? How many spectacular screenplays, do you suppose, never make it to the screen because of the same predjudices against anything different?<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is different. It grabs hold of you by your insides and forces you into the Hero's predicament, makes his confusion yours, makes his journey to self-discovery yours. It tosses out little clues now and then, cunningly leads the viewer into making their own leaps of logic, but never does it dare let you think you know for certain what's going on... and whenever you think you're getting close to the truth, well. Time for another look at the scenario from further away, isn't it?<br/><br/>The concept was a beauty; and very rarely is something this complex and at the same time, elegantly simple, ever realized so well. This movie works. Put away the high-brow criticism and the analysis and watch it; it works. The mood is perfect, the plotline both original and painfully real, the pacing near-genius.<br/><br/>Supposedly, this movie is lost to the mass-market. The average American moviegoer can't hold his/her attention to the screen for long enough to unravel this gem of a film. Requires too much thought, requires too much energy, doesn't come in a language or a format most can comprehend.<br/><br/>It's not being handed to you gift-wrapped, in other words.<br/><br/>Again I say, so what? You'd almost think the average viewer was suffering from the same short-term memory deficit that causes Leonard to restlessly flip through channels on the television. There's a term for this: short attention span, brought about by fifty years of thirty-second bursts of consumer incentive and half-hour sitcoms with neat little plots and no loose ends. Hello. This is reality knocking, may I come in?<br/><br/>And if the answer is no, go back to cowtipping on Friday nights, or go and see 'Austin Powers 3' or whatever other bit of tripe the movie industry is throwing out this summer, and leave mind-trip masterpieces like 'Memento' to the big boys and girls who can handle it."

","<ul><li>Spoiler Alert - Memento appears to be the kind of film which actually would be a lot more cerebral when reading the short story it was based on. It is to Nolan's credit that the entire vehicle remains tight and not tacky with the narrative running in retro-linear fashion. There have been films of late playing around with the content of time and space, and there is a good parallel between a thriller like this in comparison to say, Timecode. But this thriller plays out more like a mix between the Australian sleeper Proof and the psychotically brilliant Pi. The former is seen in the fumbling of clues between a man on STM and a blind figure, and the latter especially in the black/white mise-en-scenes. Right up to the end, it is open to interpretation who actually did what and for what reason, but it is this sort of interplay which allows for Nolan and his intelligent cast to communicate the message to the audience.</li></ul>"

","I was just reading the ""goofs"" for this movie.  There is only one, but in defense of the film makers, screenwriters etc. I will make an argument that the one goof isn't a goof at all.  You say that Lenny shouldn't know that he has a condition because his short term memory loss would prevent him from remembering the condition.  But...I say that he knew the condition existed before he was injured.  Remember Sammy?  I realize that it is up for debate whether Sammy even existed, the movie never gives a definitive answer to this question and it is left up to the viewer. I am persuaded to believe that Sammy existed and  Lenny clearly understood that people could in fact have short term memory loss before he lost his.  Since he can remember everything that happened to him before and up to the assault it makes sense to me that he could remember that he had a condition that he was already familiar with before losing short term memory.  Now on the flip side it is well to argue also that if someone knew all about (another disease in the movie) diabetes, and lost short term memory....then being diagnosed with diabetes after the injury would a person realize and remember to treat the disease?  I don't know.  But it was cleaver of the film makers to attempt to explain Lenny's knowledge of his condtion in this way.<br/><br/>
It is a mark of a very well made movie that keeps a person guessing even months after first seeing it. Memento is a very smart movie, that requires thought, attention and an open mind to understand. Brilliant sequencing, shooting, and acting add up to a film that gives one a glimpse into a tragic condition.  This movie will be hard to top.

After the first 15 minutes, I thought that I had gotten the hang (sort of like when I drive in England) of it's overlapping reverse order story segments, and figured that if I could just maintain the same level of concentration, I would be able to accurately reconstruct the whole play of event in my head in the correct order, and thereby know if the opening scene was the  proper outcome. I was doing well until the last 15 minutes, when it seemed to me that the two main characters are simply out-improvising/lying & out-doubting/forgetting (respectively) each other, with no more backup information given to help the viewer decide what's what. So, I left the theatre not knowing if the 'hero' had in fact done the right thing in the first scene.<br/><br/>However, I thought about this and NOW I wonder if that issue really mattered. Perhaps the whole point was to place the viewer in the hero's shoes (or, mind) so thoroughly that the viewer ultimately suffers the same dilemma. I simply might be unable to keep enough of the facts clear in my head for long enough to be able to separate them from the falsehoods seeded by those who wished to manipulate the hero (the same experience he would be having). If that was the film maker's intention, then this has to be one of the best movies for thinking viewers to be made in many years. If the makers intended that the viewer leave the experience knowing if the hero sorted things out correctly, then either they or I failed. But I really, really tried my best........"

","From the tagline it may seem as though I am not recommending the film, but nothing could be further from the truth. This film is interesting, different and has imagination to spare. Yet, I say see this film only once. Here is why:<br/><br/>Utter confusion is a likely response to this film. Once you think you understand everything and have figured out this little murder mystery, all of your assumptions are challenged leaving your mind in a daze. This is precisely the point. This film does an incredibly effective job of making you feel like the lead character who has lost his short term memory in a violent encounter. Going back to watch it changes that perspective. Furthermore, there are no answers, in my opinion, to be discovered. I think this is also by design. This is no Sixth Sense where you can go back and pick up clues. And, even if there is an answer and I am wrong, I think the perspective created by this film is precious enough not to ruin with a return trip. <br/><br/>So, go and see this film, but pay attention the first time. Afterwords, let you memories fade and live in confusion just as the lead character did."

","Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" (Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano, Carrie-Anne Moss, Stephen Tobolowsky) is definitely a thinking man's movie.  A guy with no short-term memory is trying to solve his wife's murder.  But how does he remember the clues he uncovers?  By taking copious notes and photos, and tattooing the really important stuff onto his body.  In order for the audience to share in his feeling of never knowing what just happened in the recent past, the story is told in reverse; that is, short, five-minute or so chunks of normal time are told in backward order so you only know what IS going on, not what just DID go on a few minutes ago.  The gimmick works well and the movie is a lot of fun in an intellectual sort of way.  You can search for deeper meanings if you want to (i.e., don't we all just live in the present?) but it's fun if you do or not.  Some good unexpected humor, too."

"sndrclsn","9","0","1","16 June 2001"," Very original
","This afternoon I read an article on the Internet about how to market movies in an original way. Probably the best example of such smart marketing was the whole story around ""The Blair Witch Project"". This article mentioned another example, the web site  for the movie ""Memento"". The name of the web site is backwards, because this perfectly matches with the storyline: it starts with the end and ends in the past. I was intrigued by the article, so I visited the site. I found a mysterious introduction to the film, giving different hints about it, dosed in such a way that I got so curious I had to see the movie as soon as possible, today. Before that, I checked IMDB and noticed that Memento even made it to number 12 in the all time top 250. And I never even heard about it!<br/><br/>The opening scene gets you immediately. Only after at least a minute I noticed it was played backwards completely. It shows a polaroid picture developing. That is, you see a (dead) man on a developed polaroid picture that's fading more and more. Right after that, you see the picture being taken and a bullet leaving the killed body flying back into a gun. The rest of the story is in fact a number of scenes of the history that led to this last scene, but cut into pieces and put backwards. Why was the movie made this way? Because the main character has lost the ability to remember things that just happened (his short term memory). Watching the film, the viewer sort of suffers the same, because you never know why things happen the way they do. From the beginning of the film, you want to know about the past. The future is irrelevant. You want to know who is who, how the main character gathers all his facts helping him to find and kill the man who murdered his wife and caused him to lose his memory. But also maybe: did he really kill the man he was looking for? Or is someone trying to mislead him? Nobody can be trusted, because you don't know anything for sure.<br/><br/>It is an interesting concept for a movie. But to be honest, after 45 minutes I was thinking how much longer is this going to take? Step by step you are taken along on the path of finding out what had happened and this could have been done somewhat faster. But right at the moment you think you're going to just simply peel of all the layers of the onion until you're at the inside, the movie takes a surprising turn. The main character records everything he hears and sees by writing it down. He can only trust on these notes as facts, because his memory can't help him. In one of the most critical scenes, he just hasn't got the time to write down what has just happened to him and astonishing as it is for the viewer, this means that he manages to forget something that is crucial for the things that will happen in the future.<br/><br/>Watching this film is indeed very confusing for the viewer. The complexity of the order in which everything happens makes you forget about the future and not yet know about the past. While watching you realise that the end of the movie will explain it all. It will, but you still are confused. This is the typical film you just have to see again to understand all the details. And yes, I don't know why, but I really felt as if I myself had lost my short term memory during the first minutes after the movie, walking out of the theater. I do not remember ever having experienced such a subtle sort of brainwash after seeing a film. Exciting, somewhat scary, but impressive once you're completely ""sober"" again.<br/><br/>Of course there are some logical flaws in the movie, concerning the short term memory of the main character. Sometimes he seems to be able to remember things I guess he should not have been able to remember. But just like ""Back to the future"" also has its minor flaws, in general the story is really good and can keep you thinking about it for days. It could have been just a little bit more perfect. My last hesitation is therefore if I should find this a super top film that deserves the title ""classic"". I fear that in the end the movie lacks just this tiny bit of perfection, which makes it just a very original film but not more than that. At least, I think I'll remember it as such in a couple of years."

"cfidsmarc","10","0","1","15 June 2001"," SPOILER! Tips on What Happened, What to Look For, And Why.
","I agree with the critics. Memento is one of the GREATEST movies ever made. The themes are deep, especially those pertaining to the nature of memory (e.g., remembering or blocking out what you want or NEED to) and the huge significance memory plays in our lives. The experience of watching the movie gives you some sense of what it is like to live with CFS or some form of dementia. That is the brilliance of the ""gimmick"" that works so effectively. The screenplay and acting are superb. There are very few movies I have thoroughly enjoyed on the 12th viewing -- and I'm ready to go back again. I figured out what really happened (for sure) only after the 4th viewing (which was later confirmed by reading the screenplay). There is a HUGE amount of detail in the movie (the dialogue, the voice-overs, the police reports, the flash backs, etc.) just as there is in real life. For example, watch very carefully the end of the flashback of Sammy in the mental ward and for less than a second you will see another face take the place of Sammy's... Some important facts, but there are far, far more: Leonard's wife survived the attack and DID have diabetes. Note Leonard continues to alter his memory to suit his needs (e.g., re ""his"" clothing and car) after the incident (attack and blow to his head). On first or second watching it does seem that ""its all up for interpretation"" but this is NOT really true. Watch and listen more closely and the plot and the themes become clear. Natalie (Carrie Ann Moss) does use Lenny to kill Teddy because she figures out that Teddy set up her boyfriend Jimmy. Lenny is used by Teddy to make money from Natalie's boyfriend Jimmy and to get a drug dealer off the streets. (Also note Teddy has sincere feelings for Lenny. He could have taken far greater advantage of Lenny. For a laugh, note how often Teddy tries to ""borrow"" the Jag to get the $$$. Teddy could have just stolen the money out of the trunk or taken it at gunpoint.) Lenny is a tool for Natalie to avenge her boyfriend, and Dodd is not a major character, but Dodd's threat is real and he plays a critical (and hilarious) role in revealing the extent of Lenny's handicap. My favorite part is when Lenny knowingly uses himself (the limits of his memory) to perpetuate his quest for revenge (his only remaining purpose in life) by deliberately lying to himself about Teddy near the end of the movie (and the middle of the timeline, when black-and-white switches to color in the same scene). Obviously I agree this movie is worth the effort and am frustrated with those too lazy to appreciate it or too impulsive to understand it. ""Your brain is a muscle, use it or lose it."""
"The Truth","8","0","2","18 June 2001"," Clever, but lacks some depth.
","The most memorable, remarkable thing in Memento is obviously its structure. The story of the film is told backwards, scene by scene. This unorthodox choice of narrative form has two purposes: firstly, it creates unique twists by showing an character act, and only afterwards revealing the (usually ambiguous) motives behind the action. Secondly, the narration helps us to identify with the main character, Leonard Shelby; Shelby's brain is damaged, and he therefore loses his short-memory several times a day. Like Leonard, the audience doesn't know what happened to him before his latest fit of amnesia. Also, like Leonard, the audience does know what happened to him before the assault that caused the injury. So we know that his wife was killed, and that revenge is the only thing that keeps him going.<br/><br/>As a structural exercise, Memento works perfectly. The backward narrative may at first seem like a gimmick, but soon one can see what a great way of telling a thriller story this is. What happens on the screen can never be taken in face value, since we never know the history behind the latest occurence. Because we know the ending we think we know the whole story, but the story reveals itself to be far more complicated than we thought. Every new revelation puts the things we previously saw into new light, right up until the very clever ending (which chronologically begins the story). Like many recent thrillers, the film ends with a surprise twist, but unlike in most of these thrillers, Memento's surprise ending doesn't render the rest of the plot illogical (Ã  la Fight Club). The director Christopher Nolan made this exact mistake in his previous film, so it's good to see he has learned something.<br/><br/>Sadly, exceptional story structure and an unique main character are not enough to bring true depth to the film. The basic story, if told chronologically, is intriguing, but not in any way exceptional. Guy Pearce does a great job portraying Leonard Shelby; still, his character faces such an extraordinary situation, that the audience can hardly sympathize or understand him. The overall feeling of the film is cold. Also, Mementos script touches some interesting issues concerning the nature of memory, but the inertia of the plot itself soon wipes over these larger themes.<br/><br/>Despite the criticism, I think Memento still is an original and mind-boggling puzzle, well worth tackling. Great brain food, but not much else."
"starlit-sky","10","0","1","17 June 2001"," The Most Original Movie Of The Year So Far
","Memento, for one thing, is a very ORIGINAL movie. It is impressive how the story is told which makes it so original. It is quite astonishing to see such an innovative method of story telling after all these years of movie making. The movie just makes you believe that there is no end of human creativity and imagination.<br/><br/>Story is told backwards from the perspective of the protagonist who cannot remember what happened 30 seconds before due to an incident in which his wife was raped and killed. The story of the movie is his attempts to find his wife's killer. It is very interesting to watch the story going backwards. The director, in my opinion, makes a flawless job of telling the story backwards; it is just ingenious. The success of the movie is mostly based on the screenplay, which is written very cleverly. In each scene, you see what happened before and try to make a connection to what you saw in the previous scene, which, in fact, comes afterwards in real time. As you reach the end of the movie, you come to know the reasons that triggered the events in the beginning, I mean at the end. The most important elements in the story telling are the writings on the protagonist's body, notes at the back of the pictures he takes in order to remember the characters and the little notes he writes on papers. As the movie goes on, you see when and for what reason he took the notes on the back of the pictures and tattooed some of them on his body. The movie also kind of makes you ask the question whether one can rely on the notes he takes as the incidents happen and whether one can rely on these notes' corresponding to the true incidents in reality. Protagonist claims that he can, answering, ""yes"" to that question but I thought the otherwise. <br/><br/>This is not a easy movie to understand. I am going to rent it when it comes out because there are some things that I didn't understand. In the end, like me, you may find yourself asking whether there was a character named Sammy in reality, who killed his wife, what was his real job or even who was Teddy. But these questions don't take any excitement from the movie. This is a very, very good movie. I strongly believe that this movie deserves at least a couple of Oscar nominations (I know there are probably very good productions to come before the year), including ""The Best Original Screenplay"", ""Best Director"" or even ""Best Editing""."

","Like a rocket ship, Christopher Nolan has arrived.  Not since Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie hit us with ""The Usual Suspects"" have I seen a thriller this refreshing. The plot unfolds in reverse with ingenuity and seamless precision.  Much as McQuarrie relied on Verbal Kint's monologue to carry the viewer from scene to scene, Nolan allows an ongoing telephone conversation to grease his transitions.  A case can be made that Nolan is even more successful.  The film's over arching themes of denial, and the difficulty of living a life that acknowledges a past, present, and future, keep the conversations going well after the movie ends. <br/><br/>
Guy Pearce is outstanding and with this role, should begin to be noticed for the versatile actor he is.  Even though Carrie-Anne Moss turns in a credible performance, she will never get out from under ""Trinity"" in what may end up being sixteen sequels to ""The Matrix"".  Surprisingly, Joe Pantoliano plays the same character he has been playing for 13 years and as is often the case, does it well.  Remember what your momma told you about practice?<br/><br/>Hopefully this is just the beginning for Nolan, yet his next project is an action film with big Al Pacino and (gasp) Robin Williams.  With any luck, he will follow McQuarrie's example rather than Singer's.  Even if he is a one hit wonder, ""Memento"" will stand the test of time."

","It's really not a question of whether you should see this film, rather when you should. It's obviously not an actionfest, however neither is it a mildly engaging thriller with a good plot and an unexpected twist. This is a film that requires the utmost concentration throughout to keep up with exactly what's going on - it's not a rollercoaster that threatens to throw you with sharp turns and dizzying sights, more of an endurance test which you struggle to keep a grip of for it's near two hour running time.<br/><br/>The films concerns an ex-insurance investigator, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce, who gives a remarkable performance and is almost matched by the other cast members), who has lost the ability to form new memories since he was attacked while his house was broken into. The same incident left his wife raped and murdered and now his only purpose for living is to exact vengeance on the person who ruined his life. We follow his endeavours in trying to find this man and also to try and not have his condition taken advantage of by the various manipulative characters who know him.<br/><br/>The reason for Memento making you feel like your grey matter is being stretched like the fabric of Lara Croft's t-shirt is not just because it is a meticulously constructed plot packed with twists, but because you have to negotiate the storyline backwards, reflecting Leonard's inability to remember what had previously occurred. Only the opening scene runs literally in reverse, however the sequence of scenes is rearranged so you know the end of the story from the start (bear with me here, please) but not until the final line are you able to say you can truly see the full picture.<br/><br/>Once this narrative structure is adopted writer/director Christopher Nolan is more or less committed to it, although there are some interspersed scenes in black and white that break the framework but are vital in revealing clues or sometimes providing further complexity. When these 'flashbacks' (although essentially the entire film is composed of flashbacks) become one of Leonard's facts to remember each day, due to him taking a polaroid of the incident, the film subtly transfers back to colour. This format, combined with a sparse soundtrack and relentless  reassesment of each characters motives, makes Memento a wearing but ultimately rewarding experience; the only moments of levity are some laugh out loud moments due to Leonard's condition, or rare dramatic irony which we are denied for most of the film. However, even these are offset by the tragic story of Sammy, a man with a similar condition, that runs alongside the main events and is uncomfortable viewing. Make sure you've got your thinking cap on when you watch this film, anyone wearing their dunce's cap will quickly get lost and be denied a great challenge."

","This is a film that makes you think and it takes a while to realise that you're basically seeing the film backwards - not really in flashbacks but almost like mirror-writing, if you know what I mean. It made me wonder how the film was made.<br/><br/>Was the film made in a chronological order and then, by way of very clever editing, dissembled and then re-assembled in an ""anti-clockwise"" order? It's possible, with the addition of some extra scenes to cement the whole picture together.<br/><br/>It was all very complicated, but it gripped me to the end. Once I started watching it I daren't leave it, because I felt that I wouldn't be able to pick up the plot again easily.

","I rarely go to the theater anymore, with most movies consisting of overblown Hollywood drivel such as Pearl Harbor and the like - but Memento is a true masterwork of film-making, very original in its concept and execution. The reverse chronology always keeps you guessing, as you play out the plot in your mind again and again. This is a thinking man's movie to be sure. My only negatives would be that it is quite dark and disturbing in its subject matter, with a lot of tension that some might find hard to deal with.

"jhclues","9","0","1","10 June 2001"," Talk About ""Living In the Moment""
","This is one unique motion picture; a film noir the likes of which you've never seen before nor are likely to see again any time soon.  Like `Jeopardy,' the TV game show, `Memento,' written and directed by Christopher Nolan, begins by giving you an answer (not to be confused with `the' answer), then lets you try to fill in the question.  The story, told backwards (beginning with the end, the scenes are presented in reverse chronological order) is about a man named Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), who after suffering a traumatic blow to the head during an incident involving his wife (Jorja Fox), can no longer create new memories.  Though he can remember everything up to the time of the incident, his short term memory lasts no longer than fifteen minutes, which renders him somewhat incapable (as you can imagine) of functioning normally.  Which makes his current preoccupation especially difficult-- tracking down the man who did this to him.<br/><br/>	Ensconced in a cheap motel while he attempts to sort out his new life, Leonard must rely on Polaroid photographs and quickly scribbled notes to keep himself in the game.  The particularly pertinent information he uncovers he tattoos on himself (a man's initials, a license plate number, whole sentences that remind him what he's after), thereby insuring that no vital piece of the puzzle that is now his life will be lost.  But it's a tricky business, especially when it comes to remembering who he can trust. All he has to go on are his instincts and his notes; and constantly having to deal with people he's just met-- even if it is the same ones, over and over again-- puts him in a perpetually vulnerable position.  He knows there are those who would exploit him because of his condition, so along with everything else, he has to keep his guard up every minute.  How can he know who to trust when everyone he deals with is a stranger?  It's a sticky wicket, to be sure; but he's determined to play out the hand he's been dealt, one way or another.<br/><br/>	Pearce gives a solid performance as Leonard, a guy to whom the phrase `living in the moment' takes on a whole new meaning.  He makes Leonard convincing by never overplaying him, and by maintaining a kind of subtly reserved resignation laced with tentative anxiety; traits you would expect of someone in his condition.  And that Pearce can make that critical connection with the audience, making Leonard someone to whom they can relate, is especially important, as this is a real `What would I do in that situation?' kind of film.  <br/><br/>	Also very effective is Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, the woman whom Leonard may or may not be able to trust.  Natalie becomes something of a mystery within the mystery, as she comes across as rather enigmatic initially; one of those characters you can't quite figure out, which allows you to identify with Leonard even more, because you know he's trying to decipher her motives, as well.  The same can be said for Teddy, played by Joe Pantoliano, who becomes another constant enigma in Leonard's life.  It's another case of `Who is this guy, really?' and, again, along with Leonard, it keeps you guessing until the end-- which is really the beginning.  But it's that kind of movie; a first rate mystery, from end to beginning (and when you see it, you'll understand).  At any rate, by the time it's over you have a pretty good idea of what fits where.  Natalie, at least, tips her hand at one point; Teddy, though, is a bit tougher to figure out.  And if you don't believe me, just ask Leonard.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Mark Boone Junior (Burt), Stephen Tobolowsky (Sammy Jankis), Harriet Sansom Harris (Mrs. Jankis), Callum Keith Rennie (Dodd) and Larry Holden (Jimmy).  This is one of those movies that leaves you asking yourself, `Who could think up something like that?' while at the same time you're saying `Yeah! give me more!'  To say the least, `Memento' is emotionally involving and thoroughly engrossing, and Nolan wisely throws in some humor to give some respite to the constant, underlying tension (at one point Leonard says to Teddy, `Did I ever tell you about Jankis?'  To which Teddy replies, `Only every time I see you.').  Reminiscent of `Jacob's Ladder,' but taken to the `Nth' degree, this is one film that will keep you talking about it-- and debating-- for a long time.  And in another unusual twist, the real irony begins once the film is over, because at that point you're able to identify with Leonard even more-- there's just so much you have to remember to arrive at your final conclusion.  Your best bet?  Watch it again.  That's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10."

The backwards format *alla backwards Seinfeld episode* was perfect for this as well.. and left you wondering which end was up and what ANY of the characters actually were. I don't know about giving it a 9 when you see all the great films from the past lower, there is no way this will leave an imprint like star wars did (who can argue that it changed Sci-Fi) or even a film like Shawshank. It does however follow an original style and does it well. The acting was also superb.

","This is a film that is difficult to review as it is to see it, since anything you might say could spoil part of it. But believe me, no matter how much you try to imagine what you are about to see before you see it, you´ll never ger near by far. I had read many reviews, magazines, sites and still, so I thought I was prepared to see this film with no problem, but I was wrong, this film shocked me until the end of my spine.<br/><br/>A film so unique that is able to create a new genre on its own, but I still don´t know how to name it, maybe I lack the imagination for it, but that is what the film is flooded by. This film is not only an achievement in story telling but also in atmosphere, mood and pace; it never lets go. It is engaging from beginning to end, one blink and you lose part of it; but believe me also in this, you won´t be able to blink once you set eyes on it, and on the extreme you might even forget you were breathing while watching it.<br/><br/>In difference to other films I´ve seen throughout my entire life, this film got me in a way I can´t even mention. I still am figuring in my mind one way to solve Leonard´s problem, asking myself and getting in order what I just saw. It is certainly a film that is not possible to see just once and forget about it. I can´t wait to see it again; to witness and hope Leonard would find a way to solve the case.<br/><br/>It also leaves you wondering, if Leonard´s ""condition"" was either a bless or a curse. Imagine what would it be like to commit acts you won´t remember you did, what would it be like to have no record of time, and be able lo live the same thing over and over without feeling how time eats you as you get older; also what would it be like to nurture a feeling you have inside for the rest of your life and nothing else really matters. You´ll feel that way once you see Memento.<br/><br/>It is certainly not an easy movie to see, it makes you part of the environment, you will have to set your brain in motion in order to comprehend what is going on, but I assure you, you won´t be the same person as you were before you see it."

The premise--that this guy has lost all short-term memory and thus every hour is a fresh start--nicely fits the backwards nature of the storytelling.  We see the end and work back to the beginning, and along the way all of our landmarks are turned upside down. Just when you start to think you have a handle on a character, you see what that person did previously and it distorts your thinking.  We know immediately that Leonard, played by Guy Pearce with his usual flawless American accent, is trying to track down his wife's killer.  I don't think it's a spoiler to say that by the end of the movie, you leave the theater wondering if you really know whodunit.  The brilliance of the movie is how it gets from the end to the beginning and keeps the viewer engaged (and occasionally breathless)."

The same intruders took Leonard's short-term memory with a hard blow to his temple.  Leonard has a short 15 or less minute span in which he can remember things (less in anxious situations), after that he must remind himself of what has happened in his life up to this point with little scraps of paper and a polaroid camera that he always carries with him.

It begins with the climax of the story and Leonard putting to death the person (Teddy) he believes murdered/raped his wife.

This movie has a sort of authenticity and uniqueness about it that I have yet to see since a movie named Fight Club. I think real thought and effort can only go into movie if you have limited money and resources to work with, it breeds creativity.  Big budget movies like Pearl Harbor pale in comparison and only gain audiences through high dollars budgets and millions spent in advertising and top dollars actors.

There was no need for a huge movie budget, overpaid actors and actresses, a commercial preview every hour, etc you know what I mean.

I have always thought of movies as the only art I will ever appreciate. I am far from artistic and even creative but for an hour and a half I have seen another Mona Lisa. Don't get me wrong, the Mona Lisa is breathtaking I am sure but this movie in it's own way showed me how talented a cast and crew working together to make such an entertaining movie that still to this day keeps me thinking.

","Really, you need to see this movie. You've never seen anything like it.<br/><br/>This movie requires a hell of a lot of thought. Unlike normal movies which move forward, you don't have to remember every little bit of what happened before all the time. But here, since you see everything backward, you have to keep in your mind what's going to happen so you can make sense of things that *have* happened. At a point, I got worried, because I knew the end was near and I hoped it didn't have a bad ending to ruin a perfectly good movie. But oh, the end is great. By the end, you'll be throughly confused, or pleased if you think you've got it figured out. Don't see it alone; you're going to want people to talk about it with afterward. We think we've got it figured out. But not completely. I'd need to see it again in more detail, and it may even be helpful to view the movie *forwards*.<br/><br/>There is the plot at hand, and there is the pervasive meditation on the nature of memory. Memories change. What is real? Truth, lies, all blend into one.<br/><br/>Part of the movie does move forward, though, in scenes intercut between the reverse vignettes. It's brilliant, really, having Leonard telling his story to someone on the phone, conveniently telling us as well, so we are educated about his condition and what he's done about it.<br/><br/>Notably, the story is told backwards. Much has been made of the fact that a *Seinfeld* episode did it, and so did Harold Pinter's *Betrayal*, and I'm sure others as well, but here there is a very damn good reason for it. By watching the events in reverse, *we* are in Leonard's shoes. We feel the same disorientation, the same confusion. He can't remember what he's done, and we can't see the next few minutes of the reel. This leads to some absolutely hilarious jokes, as well as some cleverly ironic twists.<br/><br/>Teddy (Joe Pantaliano of *Matrix* fame) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, also of *Matrix* fame), apparently. There are very few characters in the film, but the few there are are very important.<br/><br/>*Memento* is about Leonard Shelby (played beautifully by Guy Pearce, of *L.A. Confidential* fame), a man who is trying to find the man that raped and murdered his wife. There's just one problem: trying to stop it, he took a blow to the head, and now he has a unique amnesia where he cannot for new memories. He can remember everything before the incident, but every fifteen minutes, his short-term memory is wiped clean. He must take pictures, leave himself notes, give himself tattoos. Whom can he trust?<br/><br/>You've heard the hype, I'm sure. And I'm just going to add to it, and tell you to get off your damn computer and go see this movie.<br/><br/>I saw *Memento*!

Even though Leonard can remember everything before his wife's murder about him and everything else, the trauma from the incident has scarred him and put him in this condition. However, we get the complete uneasyness and confusion of Leonard as people enter his life such as a bartender (played by Carrie Ann Moss of Matrix notaritity) and another somewhat perhaps shaddy character known as Lenny portrayed by Joe Pantoliano (Ralph from the Sopranos) may have alterior motives.  Since Leonard will loose what he learns in a short time, you wonder if the other characters are exploiting his condition for their own needs and leading him to the wrong killer.<br/><br/>The film with great acting and great characters, excels at one thing that you will notice instantly.

","Let me begin by stating that this movie is brilliant, incredible, beautiful in its intrinsic nature, etc. etc. etc.  However, I have not seen the movie in a month or so and, hence, will try not to let these feelings play a bias role in what I'm about to say.<br/><br/>I want to respond to a few comments that have been made thus far regarding certain so-called ""disappointing"" aspects of the film.  Perhaps doing so will help others who have already experienced this film, but above all, I want to stress one thing: Those who believe Memento looks interesting should go ahead and take the challenge, but of these people who see the film, every single one should see it again, and at the very least, contemplate for awhile.  Okay, on to it. . .<br/><br/>First.  Some have described the use of backward storytelling as a gimmick. However [and I am not the first to say this either], could this film have been created in any other way?  Could we revel in our bewilderment as the last scene ends in black and the credits roll had the story been told in the same old ""normal"" way?  I think not.  As many have already discussed, we are stepping into the soles of Leonard's shoes.  In order to fully appreciate his situation, we must be just as baffled as he is.  And can we not simply appreciate Nolan's ability to fashion such a tale?  As for this so-called gimmick"" causing viewers to question the plausibility of the story, consider the fact that Nolan creates an environment in which our own minds fail us. As the film progresses, we begin to lose track of what has been happening thus far--yes, the plot becomes fuzzy and even perforated, but all to contribute to our identification with Leonard.<br/><br/>Second.  I read a few comments criticizing character depth, i.e. not being able to care enough.  Perhaps Leonard's character appears shallow [for lack of a better word], but he has no short term memory.  He feels as though he is only ""half a man at best"".  His life is a mere 5 minutes in length at all times.  Not to mention that his long term memories only serve to remind him of his once happier and now long lost life.  All of this would contribute to just about anyone's sense of shallowness--in the literal sense, of course.  Teddy's character, on the other hand, absolutely exudes depth in the sense that we are forced into a constant state of speculation: did he kill Leonard's wife, or is he trying to help Leonard, does he truly care, or is he actually using Leonard, if so, why?  At times I was right along with Leonard when he would take out the ""don't trust him"" photograph. However, I also found myself sympathizing with Teddy--his giant smile so inviting, yet so repulsive and sinister at the same time.  [Bravo Joe Pantoliano!]<br/><br/>And finally.  Many have described this film as disappointing, riddled with plot holes, implausible, or simply unimpressive.  I, as others do, feel as though these people have not experienced the big picture [no pun intended]. This movie actually requires subsequent viewings, or at the very least, a structured explanation from someone who has partook in this ritual.  I will admit whole-heartedly that when the credits began to roll, I was dumbfounded--I did not necessarily feel cheated, but the answers I wanted were not readily available as they are in most films.  This is a situation with which many have a problem.  The ""I want answers, and I want them now"" is indeed indicative of our rushed society of today.  Perhaps we need to look at film the way we do art.  It isn't all completely accessible right away.  Upon discussion over coffee with someone on her second viewing, many of my questions were, in fact, answered.  We need time to ponder, and this may take hours, days, or even months.  Entertainment is not always instantaneous.  In my opinion, as a criterion, entertainment should in fact endure for as long as it possibly can.<br/><br/>Someone recommended reading Kant rather than seeing this film, and while I do not necessarily agree with this line of suggestion, I do agree that both Kant and Memento are good examples of true entertainment--both contain qualities that allow for extended contemplation and, hence, dazzle the mind as good entertainment should."

","I'll not repeat what's already been said in praise of this film, but I will say, to the people who thought it a little 'gimmicky' that the way the story is told (in reverse) is,in my opinion, absolutely not a gimmick. It is a very clever device for putting the viewer inside the head of the main character. Combined with the superb acting and direction, you end up experiencing the action from exactly the same viewpoint as the lead character. Your sense of confusion mirrors his, and as you begin to identify more with him your lack of trust for any of the characters makes you edgy and distrustful. I've never before seen a movie that's put me in the head of one of the characters in the way this one does.<br/><br/>*Possible Spoiler* It's a far superior film to Sixth Sense or Usual Suspects because once you've seen the ending of those films you know what happened and the next time you see it the impact is completely lost. Memento has no traditional ending in that sense; you are left to make up your own mind as to how all the scenes fit together, as to what interpretation to put on all the character's actions, as to what their motives were. On top of that, it left me full of questions about reality and how we perceive the world, and how it makes us vulnerable. I thought this was a profoundly unsettling, disturbing, and funny film. 10 out of 10."

","As I write this there are 370 comments on Memento.  Most movies have trouble eclipsing 50.  This fact alone should encourage you to see Memento.  I don't think it's necessary to pick the plot apart, because everyone I've talked to has a slightly different interpretation than the other.  The point is, this movie really challenges the audience to stay focused with it the entire time, and to think, to connect things.  And most importantly, it doesn't leave you with the theater.  A lot of movies, like, oh say, Rob Schnieder's The Animal probably will stay with your popcorn in the trash after you leave the theater.  Memento's right there with you, and, it's really annoying. You'll be thinking and talking about Memento for a week, and if you saw it with anyone that's all you'll talk about at least the night you've seen it. For this reason, it deserves to be in the top twenty or so movies of all-time.  Some people might miss the charm of the movie if they try to pick it apart too much, since the character Guy Pearce plays is so concerned with details we become too, and there is a point where you can go too far in trying to interpret.  It's best to let the movie just flow into you and enjoy."
"Lunchbox-8","10","0","1","5 June 2001"," Without a doubt, by far the best movie I've seen in the theaters in over a year
","Memento truly was a unique movie.  First of all, the major and most engaging attribute to the movie was the non-linear, backwards time-line that the movie was based on.  It really was the only successful way to present all the facts in the movie but still keep up on the whole memory loss factor.  It was really cool though because it was so confusing.  It wasn't really that confusing but it was enough for (sorry for breaking the golden rule) me to speak out in the theater to my buddy and ask him for some concise guidance.  But with the backwards plot, there was a telephone discussion between the main character and a soon-to-be-known other character.  <br/><br/>  In short, Memento was a fascinating movie that took a seemingly simple plot (SEEMINGLY!) and turned it into a truly unique and rewarding movie theater experience."

","Purpose!  We all need purpose in life otherwise why do we go on?  The central theme here of revenge is not new but it is refreshed by both the central character's 15 minute memory and the use of retrospective editing. Having watched Guy Pearce move from 'Neighbours' to movies I can only say how impressed I am at both his versatility and overall acting ability.  I thought L.A. Confidential was the tops but this beats that by a mile.<br/><br/>This movie, well acted as it may be, however, needs the viewer to watch and listen to every nuance, as it is both difficult to comprehend and irritatingly interesting at the same time.  It is both a must see movie and a 'see it again' movie.  Why?  Because no matter how hard you try you will still be dumbfounded by the ending the first time around.

","Leonard Shelby (Guy Pierce) is a troubled man. On one unfortunate day, his wife is brutally raped and murdered. In the process of trying to save her, he is attacked from behind and bangs his head into a mirror. find and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. The savage attack gives him brain damage, and he now suffers from a rare and untreatable form of memory loss. He knows who he is and recalls everything up to the crime, but now he can no longer create new memories, meaning he can't remember people he's met, places he's been or things he's done even fifteen minutes ago.  To help him exist and find the man responsible for his condition and his wife's death, he makes notes, take photos and get tattoos all over his body for the really important clues he discovers. All of the notes lead to one important mission: FIND HIM AND KILL HIM.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those films that you really have to watch. Like `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable', if you daydream for one second, you are lost and getting back on the Memento highway is hard as hell.  Christopher Nolan directs this movie in a way that we all feel like Shelby. Being that he can't retain a memory for a long period of time, he gets confused a lot and that is exactly how the audience feels. How can you solve a crime when you can't remember the clues and even though you have the clues written down, you don't thoroughly understand what they mean? Even though you remember your past, how can you exist in the present when you can't string enough minutes together to create one?  That's the foe Shelby struggles against. Nolan creates a movie that is very M. Night Shyamalan in the essence that it exist in the present, flashback to the past, and foreshadows to the future all at the same time. I consider both director's movies to be like those seeing eye pictures. All the parts are there and if you pay attention and watch it, the hidden picture will reveal itself. If you take your eyes away, you have to start over again. This is supported by a statement by Shelby in which he is telling himself to just focus and he will remember a thought longer than he has before.<br/><br/>
As for the acting, I didn't have a problem with anyone. Guy Pierce plays the human goldfish character very well. I describe him as a goldfish because a goldfish has a memory span of thirty seconds. So when a goldfish is looking at you, it's seeing you first time every thirty seconds. Never did he give me the impression that he wasn't confused.  Carrie Ann Moss (MATRIX) plays yet another well acted pawn in this who did it game. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."

","Just saw this film, so I'm in the grip of trying to process it... give me a minute... Great film, reminded me of The Usual Suspects in the way that you had little to rely on to distinguish lies from truth.<br/><br/>**spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>Sorry, I've got to do this, 'cause I just can't not say something. Some reviews poo-poo the film because they say the ending is too neat or too gimmicky or whatever.  I ask, what exactly does the ending tell us?  Do we believe the supposed ""truth"" just because it comes at the end of the movie? Consider the source -- a slimeball who has lied to the main character in every single scene -- why do *we* believe him?  Some of what he says is substantiated (the photo of Leonard) but do we believe everything?  I think the truth and lies are meshed together so tightly that we can't unravel them any better than Leonard can. The next question is, has Leonard painted himself into a corner so that he has to stop?  After all, every single one of his notes now points to John G, bad cop.  He has a photo proof of his deed.  Teddy can no longer use him for his own ends.  What will he do next?<br/><br/>I gave this film a slightly lower rating than I did The Usual Suspects because you can imagine that you know what happened here (not like U.S., where nearly everything is related second hand, so you never know).  Also, the ""gimmick"" at the end of U.S. was better, in my opinion. <br/><br/>In summary, it was very very good.  Pearce, as usual, did a stellar job. Pantoliano (sp?) also as usual did a great job playing the smarmy nice/not nice guy who lives (or dies) by lying.  Moss did a great job, which upon reflection, becomes an excellent job -- after all, *we* believed her (as Leonard did).  It takes a slick actor to **spoiler** believably switch from hating a guy's guts for killing her boyfriend to feeling sorry for him and helping him.<br/><br/>Thanks go out to the makers of ""Memento"" for making a film that makes you think.  There are precious few out there."

","Whilst watching Memento's first few minutes, I remember thinking ""my god this is going to be tedious"". As the story kept showing us a scene, then showing the scene that led to the scene, but after about ten minutes I didn't notice at all. I was hooked.<br/><br/>Memento was British Director Christopher Nolan's follow up to his low budget Début ""Following"" and I must say he looks like a director to watch. The handling of the tricky flashback structure and tightly woven plot means you're guessing right to the end (or should that be the begining). Telling the story like this really helps us identify with the main character Leonard (Guy Pearce), we never are sure of our actions, never knowing who we can trust, we just have to stick with what Leonard believes as to being right.<br/><br/>The performance were great, especially Joe Pantoliano as Leonard's only friend ""Teddy"". He really manages to step out from the shadow of the lead and give his character a much-needed depth. Carrie-Anne Moss did not fair as well, I thought her character tended to be a little irritating, not to mention intelligent for a woman who works in a biker bar. But this is Pearce's film and he does a fantastic job realising such a complex character, giving him a constant sense of fear, cool and uncertainty.<br/><br/>I won't say much about the plot because the less you know the better, it's much more rewarding to gather the pieces together and in some way making the viewer part of the movies. So don't let what people have been referring to as a gimmicky plot put you off, check out this grown-up thriller immediately.<br/><br/>(***** Out of *****)"
"aaron-121","8","0","1","24 December 2000"," A black comedy, film-noir thriller. A minor cult masterpiece.
","A perfect film for noir fans, uncompromising and relentless. The story runs in reverse,scene by scene, from the final shot of a killing to the beginning, where all that has gone before becomes explained. Although even this is open to ambiguity and will merit a re-viewing to check on the details. Leonard (Guy Pierce), an insurance investigator, is a man suffering from short-term memory loss following a brutal attack at his home. We learn that he is seeking the killer of his wife despite the fact that he cannot make sense of the world beyond a fifteen minute span of memory. He is forced to keep records of important clues by tattoos on his body and taking polaroids of places and people, on which he has written notes to himself. As each scene opens we are only able to make sense of it by the knowledge of what is to come.<br/><br/>Running through the film is a separate series of scenes, shot in the right order, which illuminates the plot still further; Leonard explains on the telephone to an unseen listener the case study of a man he dealt with in his earlier life before he was injured, who was similarly afflicted. Leonard's job was to investigate and decide if the man's illness was psychological or physical, a fine distinction but necessary for the insurance claim. His decision haunts him and is made poignant and relevant by his own current condition.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Joe Pantaloni as Teddy, who may or may not be a cop and the delicious Carry-Anne Moss, a perfect femme fatale. But it is Pierce who lends the right air, a hero making sense of the incomprehensible, vulnerable yet tough, bewildered but determined. As we begin to understand Leonard we are taken into his world with wit and technical skill and we believe in it.<br/><br/>Despite the films obvious virtuosity some of the plot twists become a little obvious as we become used to the nuances of the characters affliction and at times the thriller element is lost; but this is a minor criticism, the film is inventive, intelligent and has more than a liberal dose of black humour. Full marks to all involved; it deserves to be a cult masterpiece."

I enjoyed the method used to tell the story and it helped connect you to the character. He does not know what is going on and neither does the audience due to the manner the movie is put together. This method works especially well for this movie and the way Leonard is able to function is intriguing and clever. It is not the chore it could have been with conventional story telling and puts you in his shoes with his condition (no more as I don't want to spoil it)Kudos to the director for keeping it all together.<br/><br/>This is such a pleasant change of pace as this time of year you get the typical slew of mindless summer movies.

It holds up well after careful consideration and I fully expect repeat business as people will want to see it once they know how it ends.

"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","1","31 May 2001"," The big difference
","I earlier commented on the mood and the score of ""Memento,"" which evoked other California psychological dramas/thrillers like ""Heat"" and ""Safe."" After seeing it again and looking at recent reactions to the film, I can say that Memento isn't the 9th best film ever made.  What it is becoming is a little hope to movielovers who are losing faith in theaters. They had 80 movies at Sundance, and only 8 of them found distribution. Even Memento, the Grand Prize winner, can only make it into 450 some theaters in the country, (despite having the fourth highest amount of money per location in the States according to Philadelphia Inquirer stats.) Meanwhile, at Cannes, Miramax picked up two films out of all the competitors, and the Palme D'or winner, ""The Son's Room,"" was left behind by U.S. companies.  (Last year ""Dancer In the Dark"" won this award.) <br/><br/>   Harvey Weinstein explained the American art market is saturated, but it's saturated because we've stopped putting really edgy stuff into the art theaters...now even the ART theaters have to have commercially viable material, because our multiplex-dominated theater landscape is rejecting anything but the simplest stuff, never mind foreign films.  Box office stats are like Scripture these days: they allow guys like Bruckheimer to claim that 75 million on Pearl Harbor's opening weekend revealed the quality of the film/audience response to it.  All the opening gross for the first few days ever indicates is the quality and level of the hype for the movie in the days before it opened.  Variety doesn't even necessarily come with a 24-theater multiplex- it just means they'll show Star Wars Episode II on 5 screens, in half-hour intervals, leaving the struggling films aside.<br/><br/>
   I bring this up because Memento is a perfect case of a really good movie that SHOULD be making box office records but has been ignored because of a little complexity and no megastar power.  People are saying it reminds them of the Sixth Sense.  Sorry, but without that ending and the performance of Haley Joel Osment, The Sixth Sense is not nearly as well-made a film as this.  Christopher Nolan's directing abilities, the writing, and the performances of his cast distinguish this film as a more than a trick-ending thriller.<br/><br/>
  I agree the ending is misleading and confusing.  However, (SPOILER) it's not Teddy's words that make the ending powerful- it's seeing Lenny deceive himself, destroy photographs of himself, and create another hunt, lying to himself to be happy.  Maybe Teddy is the culprit, but the point is that Lenny MAKES him into John G., creates and destroys evidence where he pleases, making his records totally subjective and unreliable, despite his claims to the contrary.<br/><br/>
  Maybe it's got a gimmick.  Maybe us reviewers are taking it too far, but I for one enjoy a movie that plays with our intelligence instead of just hitting us over the head with effects or pathos.  If this movie were #1 at the box office, I would likewise get tired of the hype, but instead it's being denied a chance to reach the majority of people.  Nolan and Pearce have made probably the best film of the spring, and not enough people are getting the opportunity to see it because of theaters eager to show the pre-determined ""blockbusters.""  I know it's only a movie, but given the general decline, and current lack of faith, within major theaters, Memento is a breath of fresh air."

","I really liked this movie and my fiance and I had a good time discussing it afterwards. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD! I had a lot of questions about the film, and I'm sure that others did, so this is going to be my attempt to puzzle things out. My major questions about the film revolved around one of Teddy's last conversations with Lenny, when he said that Sammy Jankis was really Lenny, and that Lenny's wife had died from an insulin overdose that he gave her. Then there are two memory short scenes showing first, Lenny giving his wife an insulin shot and second, pinching her on the thigh. This second short scene was also shown earlier in the film. Then towards the very very end we see Lenny in bed with his wife and he already has a tattoo-though it did not look to me like the tattoos he had in the rest of the film. These small scenes really confused me. I could not be sure if Teddy was telling the truth or lying to Lenny. I think that obviously the point of the film is that Lenny was lying to himself. We start off by thinking that he is very organized and really does rely on facts, and sadly, we discover throughout the course of the film that his `evidence' is completely based on intuition and emotion, and that he (and everyone else around him) is totally untrustworthy.<br/><br/>What I eventually decided was that those scenes don't matter. Teddy might very well be John G. He might not be. However, if Teddy is John G. it is not for the reasons that Lenny thinks he is-the license plate, the name, etc.My fiancé pointed out that Lenny said he did not know how long it had been since his wife's death. Since he has the police report, he should know this. This information should be printed on the police report. So, Lenny is obviously deluding himself about some things. As far as the truck and if Lenny really was an insurance investigator, since we don't know how long it's been since his wife's death, we don't know what he's been doing during that time. I checked out the website looking for some answers (It's really cool by the way) and on it they say that Lenny was in a mental hospital for a while. So who knows how long it's been and what he was doing during that time. It also show police reports about his wife's death, so we do know that's true, so I'll believe that Teddy was lying about Lenny being Sammy Jankis (why do I feel like Agatha Christie all of a sudden???).<br/><br/>Everyone was lying to Lenny and using him, but that doesn't make the premise untrue. John G. could be anyone or no one. I also wouldn't call the backwards-forwards format of the film a gimmick. It simply mirrors Lenny's confusion."

In brief, it follows the story of a man (Guy Pearce) who only wants to avenge his wife's murder and rape. The catch? He has short term memory loss, which means he cannot make any new memories of anything after 15 minutes, so he lives in fifteen minute segments, the only thing he has got is a polaroid camera, notes and tattoos of things to follow, in order to find the killer. The film poses many questions, and, trust me, if I tell you any more about it, the movie won't be as great as a first-time viewing.<br/><br/>There really isn't much else to say - except that the film is filmed very differently than your average picture.<br/><br/>Once again, all I have to say that this is one helluva film.

"David G","Null","0","1","23 May 2001"," Why I liked Memento
","[Note to readers: These comments are written specifically for those who have already seen Memento.  I would recommend you see the film without reading this (or any other) review of the film.  Save the reviews for later or you'll kill off one of the enjoyable aspects of seeing this film.  In particular, I will be giving a lot away in the following paragraphs.]<br/><br/>There has been a lot of discussion about the `gimmick' in Memento (i.e., the backwards progression of the scenes)  some like it, some don't.  But, I think this is one of the few instances in which it works.  What better way is there to get the audience to ride along with the character than to put you in the same position?  By not knowing what came right before, we are forced to struggle with Leonard's predicament rather than simply watch it.<br/><br/>I think that it is interesting how I began feeling sympathy for Leonard from the very beginning.  Here was a guy who clearly has a horrible handicap. Instead of not trusting my true instincts, I believed that he could overcome his handicap simply by leaving himself notes and being organized.  I found myself believing him and believe in him.  In hindsight, I wonder how I could allow myself to let my guard down so much.<br/><br/>Of course I shouldn't believe this guy.  He simply puts ideas together based on a couple of notes.  That's absurd.  Yet, it is only during the course of the film that I developed questions.  I think it is a testament to the filmmaker that I can be drawn in like that.  Perhaps it's the character's sincerity and confidence.<br/><br/>Finally, there have been criticisms of how this film leaves people confused, with questions, and without closure.  Some people like closure in their films and I do too -- when it's appropriate.  However, I feel there are some instances where you simply will never know the truth. I believe that in films that revolve around those situations, the lack of closure is not only acceptable, but preferable.<br/><br/>While some amateur reviewers (particularly on this website) have coined Memento a great breakthrough in filmmaking and one of the greatest thrillers ever, I think that is an exaggeration.  It's a very good film that I recommend seeing, but I think there are about 5-10 films a year that are this good.  (That said, I am implying that it will likely end up in my top 5 or 10 for the year, so I clearly liked it.)"

","Imagine waking up in the morning and not being able to remember the things you've done or the people you've met.

Such is the problem for Leonard, a man on a mission to solve a mystery that is consistently complicated by his own unique illness.

But for those who enjoy mind-boggling, open-ended and totally unpredictable cinema, you definitely might want to check it out.

","Memento in my opinion is the one of the most clever, absorbing, and powerful thrillers released EVER!!!.  In the company of other films such as SE7EN and Sixth Sense (though not nearly as graphic), Memento has probably the darkest ending I've seen in a great while.  Without the gratuitous violence and shock value this film displays all the ingredients of a classic; solid characterization, screenplay, direction, and editing (you'll understand editing after you see the film).<br/><br/>My only concern with this film is that it's an independent release with a marketing budget smaller than the amount of change in my pocket right now. Everyone I've talked to has been literally stunned by Memento, but most are film buffs like us who are on the look out for a good flick.  I just hope the film continues to grow so that the movie can find a larger audience as it so deserves.<br/><br/>Hats off to Guy Pearce and Chris Nolan (I can't believe this is his first film)and to all those involved in this picture.<br/><br/>Go see this film.  And if anyone tells you this movie wouldn't be interesting if it wasn't told backwards, well, it was never meant to, thats why the film is so ingenious.  Normally I would not associate this type of film with the academy awards but if this gem goes unnoticed, oh well, I lost all faith when Shawshank lost.  I'm thinking they'll give it a screenplay award or editing and make way for the big wigs."

He relies on notes, photos, and tattoos. The movie begins at the end of the story and works it's way back to the beginning.  As you are reconstructing the story and learning more and more about the characters you will find yourself with more questions than answers. And if you blink, you will miss something.

","The opening scene of Memento is visually stunning. A bullet re-entering a gun, a polaroid (un)forming, blood flowing back into a body. Seeing this opening scene i was immediately hooked, but i had no idea as to how affected i would be after the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is told in reverse, scene by scene. This technique not only gave the movie greater impact, but served to emphasise the movies message about memory in general.<br/><br/>As i recall the film in my mind i often find myself getting chains of events mixed up. In my memory, i continually remember the beginning of the film as the end of the film, and vice-versa.(This may sound confusing, but anyone who has seen the film should understand.) As such, the power and impact of the movie increases as i struggle to remember the films course of events, thus mirroring the films theme of the blurring of lines between memory/our perception of events with the actual facts.<br/><br/>This movie deserves several Oscar nominations as it is simply brilliant. It is a shame that it has not been seen by more people. This film has more of an impact than the excellent Sixth Sense, and deserves a bigger audience."

I was debating this & another that was available when a girl who just bought a ticket said it got good reviews, so I decided to try it & I'm glad I did.

Any inconsistencies just add to the effect.<br/><br/>Just sit back & experience it.<br/><br/>The progressions of clips work.

The story is suspenseful and tense.<br/><br/>However, the acting, though good, is not exceptional.  There are some plot imperfections, some important unresolved questions.  And, of course, there are some places where the character (who is supposed to have a short term memory loss) remembers things that happen in the near past, which is, of course, not what he's supposed to do.  <br/><br/>The ending is ambiguous and leaves the film sort of commenting on its own cleverness, rather than leading the viewer to some larger conclusion about trust in human relationships or the importance of memory.  While some people may like this effect, I found it to be somewhat of a cop out.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.  This is a great film and well worth seeing.  This is a highly enjoyable, artsy thriller.

"mwtorq","10","0","1","17 May 2001"," A great film (note: spoilers)
","This commentary will serve a number of purposes: first, to give my opinion on this film.  Second, to outline a few theories I have on various aspects of the film.  And third, to point out (what I perceive as) errors in judgment of this film that others who have commented have made.<br/><br/>First off, this is a magnificent piece of work.  Through the first thirty or so minutes of this film (which I have only seen once thus far), I was mesmerized by the technical/editing magnificence of this film.  The editing of this movie is like no other I have ever seen.  Others have compared this movie to films like ""The Usual Suspects"" (which I agree is a great film, too), ""Fight Club"" (which is one of my all-time favourites), ""Pulp Fiction"" (great), ""Clean Slate"" (have not seen), and ""The Third Man"" (have not seen). Another film (which I haven't noticed anyone mention) that plays around with ambiguities/timelines/etc. in a similarly-masterful way is the little-seen ""Schizopolis"" by Steven Soderbergh.  And then there's ""Clean, Shaven"", which also tries to put us in the shoes of a highly unusual character (Memento - person with anteriograde amnesia; Clean, Shaven - person with schizophrenia).<br/><br/>Even if this movie only had the technical/editing aspects going for it, I'd still be a big fan of it - but it does have much more going for it. Contrary to what some of said, I find this film to have quite a well-constructed storyline and group of characters.  The fact that this film is told in pseudo-reverse adds to the quality of the film - but it still would have been great told in the ""correct"" order.  One reason I say this: the killing of Teddy at the ""end""  (beginning of movie) would have had much more of an impact if we knew what came before that incident.  As it is, the killing of Jimmy at the ""beginning"" (end of movie) has a greater impact due to the order in which the story is told.  Also, contrary to what some have said, I enjoy a film with ambiguities: some may view that as a cop-out by the writer, but I view it as an opportunity for discussion to ensue.<br/><br/>Now, a few points.  There's one main theory that I have about this movie that I have not read in any other review.  Most - if not all - reviews of this movie make a point of there being some length-of-time significance to Leonard's memory problems; his short-term memory lasts 3 minutes, 6 minutes, 8 minutes, whatever.  I disagree that his memory problem has anything to do with time at all; look to the scene where Natalie shows herself to be manipulating him.  As she goes outside to her car, Leonard searches frantically for a pen to write down the fact that Natalie is manipulating him.  In the process of searching for a pen, he forgets that Natalie was manipulating him - because the focus of his memory shifted from WHAT he was trying to remember to the mere act OF remembering; he was trying so hard to remember that Natalie had manipulated him that he lost track of what he was trying to remember.  Another instance of this occurs when Leonard meets with Natalie at Natalie's bar.  So it isn't a matter of time that determines whether or not he can remember something - it's how well he is able to maintain his focus on an idea.  So long as he's able to stay focused on an idea, his recollection of that idea is intact.  Given the frantic nature of the human mind, however, it's nearly impossible for anyone to stay completely focused on one idea for any siginicant length of time; thus, Leonard loses track of what he's doing.  (As Sean Penn says in ""Hurlyburly"", ""You know what's my biggest distraction?  Me.  I am my own biggest distraction."")  Thus, his problem doesn't have anything to do with the passage of time, but rather his brain's ability to record information prior to his forgetting it.  I'm not sure if this corresponds to ""true"" anteriograde amnesia, but in any case, that's how I view *Leonard's* condition.<br/><br/>Secondly, some have mentioned being suspicious of Leonard's previous job - whether or not he was an insurance investigator, since it's odd for an insurance investigator to drive a truck.  I'm not going to touch on whether or not he had that job, but I will say this - recall early in the movie when he takes Teddy out to the remote building?  The truck that Leonard uses to drive out there earlier (later) to kill Jimmy is still there.  Leonard does not recognize it.  If the truck was his before the incident, he would remember it (of course, he may be faking..)<br/><br/>And finally, the biggest problem people have with this movie - how can he remember his condition?  Evidently, those with anteriograde amnesia DO know that they suffer from the condition (somehow).<br/><br/>Definitely one of the most unique films ever crafted; it's uniqueness is due to the nature of film itself, as this film is a great demonstration of the power and flexibility that is inherant in this unique genre of entertainment.  When the capabilities of this genre are used to their full potential (as so few films do), beautifully-unique things can be crafted - things that cannot be crafted in any other form of entertainment."

The people who made this film created a challenging and very entertaining movie, and it put my brain through its paces.<br/><br/>Although the acting is good across the board, and you have to think hard, which is reassuring in the face of all the audience-spoonfeeding that's out there, I can't help but feel that played forwards it's a run of the mill story that happens to have a twist if you watch it backwards. If they'd worked on it a little more so that the reverse-viewing was a complement to the film rather than the main selling point, this would have been a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I know it's trendy to leave questions unanswered in films these days, but there are some details that remain heavy-handedly glossed over (who the hell IS Dodd?) and others that make little sense no matter how much you replay the film forwards in your head.<br/><br/>However, I got the impression that the people who made this film, from the writer through to the editors, were content to rest on the laurels that their novelty-factor gave them, and worked an OK film onto the backwards presentation framework rather than a great one.<br/><br/>This film was indeed an interesting one, borrowing the narrative technique of reverse presentation pioneered by Pinter and giving it some good old turn-of-the-millennium grit.<br/><br/>There are no spoilers in this review."

The ten minute or so overlapping segments that flow backwards to create the movie... It's fantastic. Pearce is brilliant as Leonard Shelby, the main character. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are amazing as supporting cast; they manage wonderfully the sometimes incredibly difficult task of taking up enough of the stage to make the story work, which they have to do, considering the Shelby's disorder, (he can't remember anything for more than 10min.) without taking up so much that we focus on them instead of Shelby and his struggle to find his wife's rapist and killer, the enigmatic John G.<br/><br/>The story is great, but the style of the telling truly makes it a film to remember."

","I'm sorry to do this. I understand that different people look for different qualities in a film, but some of the criticism written about Memento needs to be addressed. <br/><br/>Some of the viewers think that the story relies on the ""gimmick"" of telling it in reverse chronological order. Sure, I agree that the story wouldn't have been as engaging had it been told chronologically but I fail to see how a director can be blamed for telling a story in the most interesting way possible. Do these same critics believe that all murder-mystery movies are to be disregarded for using the ""gimmick"" of not revealing the murderer until the end? Maybe these people are only happy watching Columbo, where you actually see the murder in the first scene.<br/><br/>I also just read a review that claims the film is inferior to the likes of Sixth Sense because the loose ends aren't all neatly tied up at the end. Now, I'm going to have to assume that the writer of this critique either has no imagination or simply can't bring himself to consider the implications of the ""open-ending"". As for similarities between the Sixth Sense and this film, I just don't see them. Both are highly enjoyable, but Memento has a much richer plot and lacks the depth of characters exhibited in Sixth Sense (this lack of depth is crucial to the film, however).<br/><br/>Once again, I understand that this movie won't be enjoyed by everyone, but at least do the writer and director the courtesy of not criticizing it's greatest elements."

You don't know where you are.  You know you don't have amnesia.  This is ongoing reality, you know that. It is that your brain cannot build new memories.  You remember your life perfectly, you think, up to a point.  The rest...?  Your present--where you are, who you're talking to, where you're going--is based on the notes you've jotted down on the Polaroids you've take.  Pictures of places, of people, of signal events in your recent life...  You know you took them, that you wrote the notes.  You recognize your handwriting.  You build each scene of your life on that construct and from it, you measure out your actions.  You know that because you've conditioned yourself to know it.<br/><br/>Your life is a quest, your body has been conditioned to know that too: you have to find the person who did this to you, who killed someone close to you.  Your life is about revenge.  What is revenge for a man who has no memory?  Whose reality is an eternal now' without a firm context.  What meaning has any relationship?  Any fact?<br/><br/>While the technique of telling a tale from backwards is not new, this is without a doubt the most compelling film I've seen in a long time.  Telling it backwards, in this case, is the only way to tell this tale.  Like any good thriller, the plot is a labyrinth.  At first it seems simple: You enter here.  You work your way through.  You arrive at the end.  Done.  Nope.  It is much more complex than that.  On top of the twists and turns are questions.  Why am I doing this?  What do I want?  Who is with me and who is against me?  Each answer seems firm, yet not.<br/><br/>Complex.  At the heart of it, though, it is elegantly simple.<br/><br/>It holds your attention throughout and, after it ends, it resonates.  It's filled with ideas...ideas about life, the nature of perception and...did I say it already?...of reality.  This isn't about murderers and vengeance. It's about you.  It keeps you thinking, keeps you frightened.  Into the night."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** The minute this movie starts you know that you are in for something great. The movie stars Guy Pearce(L.A. Confendential) as a man who is looking for his wifes murderer.  The only problem is he has short term memory loss. Which means he can't make new memories.  The movie also stars Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Patiliano(Both from THE Matrix. This movie is not you ordinary it works backwards starting with the ending first but going to the begginning which is in Black and White.  What makes this film so unique is the fact the before every scene you get a little bit of the beggining where Guy Pearce is talking to an anonymous person on the phone about a gentleman who is having the same problem as he is having.  Anyways as it goes to color it shows bit's and pieces of Guy Pearces day which is cut into when he losses his memory.  The interesting thing is instead of going foward in the story it goes backward in the story so you meet all the people but the start to be less known in the end.  Then the black and white you find out is the beggining of the story.  Another thing you notice is that Guy Pearce's character is beeing minuplilated by Joe Patilato character which is a cop,and since Guy's character has short term memory loss he doesn't remember the the cop has made him kill people before. I won't spoil the rest beacuse you will get two confused but if you like weird and if you don't like weird go see this.  You will be amazed.<br/><br/>10/10 grade."

","British director Christopher Nolan's latest venture is an intriguing and often confusing attempt to portray the events of a young widower with vengeance in mind for his late wife's killing.  What makes this different from your average revenge film is that Lenny (Guy Pearce) has a ""condition"" which means that since the incident (involving his wife's apparent rape and murder) he only has a two minute memory span.  Nolan's stroke of genius is that he offers us such a disjointed narrative that his audience can't help but identify with Lenny's disorientation!<br/><br/>Throughout the film, like Lenny, we attempt to piece together some sense of chronology and most importantly we can't be sure of whom Lenny should trust. The main support roles, Carrie Anne Moss as the femme fatale and Joe Pantoliano as the private detective-type, are both notable for their moral ambiguities.<br/><br/>Not only is the plot structure a refreshing and rewarding experience, the performances are certainly up to scratch with Guy Pearce giving another fine display in the lead role, proving that LA Confidential wasn't just a flash in the pan."

","It takes a film such as Memento to remind us what it is to watch a great movie.  At the risk of sounding like the president of its fan club, this is truly a tour-de-force from start to finish (or is that finish to start?). A career-best performance from the much under-rated Guy Pearce carries this fascinating tale of a man who has lost his world but has found a purpose to continue.  The reverse presentation keeps the audience constantly second-guessing the action and is certainly not a ""gimmick"" as it gives the viewer the same disjointed impression of the world experienced by Pearce's character. One of the year's best."

There are things that we know, but more things that we don't and many things that we think he knows, and things we wonder if he does or does not know.  This movie fits in very well with the greatest movies that take the issue of time and melt it into a viscous plaything such as Groundhog Day, Reservoir Dogs, Last Year at Marienbad, perhaps even Mystery Train, Proof or Pulp Fiction, though Memento is much more unique in its perspective than those last three.

","This movie is so original and thought provoking it has become an instant favorite of mine. It will definitely require multiple viewings to piece it together. However, unlike ""The Lost Highway"", this one can actually make sense. Throughout the course of the movie I found myself fully immersed in this tormented man's world, trying to figure things out along with him, as if I was suffering from memory loss. They let you see just enough to understand, but not enough to make it obvious. Not only is this movie thought provoking and intelligent, it is quite funny, bordering on hilarious at times.

The performances from the leads are restrained, but impeccable, the script peppered with black humour to add that gritty element to what could have been an over-stylised disaster.  Nolan handles his second feature with great discipline and confidence for someone so new to the hostile world of American movie-making. Memento reminds me of the great age of filmmaking when a film was a combination of great aspects creating a intriguing 90 minute diversion from the world.  The film of 2000."

","Wow. I cannot begin to tell you how refreshing it is to see such a piece of art released on the commercial cinema. Memento, an independent movie distributed commercially because it's done so well, is by far the best movie I have seen this year. I liked Guy Pierce in L.A. Confidential and Ravenous, but after seeing this film, he is now one of my favorite actors. He probably has the most difficult role of the year (A guy who has a a major problem with his short term memory). The movie is a murder mystery told backwards, leaving us as confused yet determined as Pierce is. The film starts (or should i say ends)with Pierce killing a man in reverse, showing the audience that, yes, this story will be told a little differently.Guy Pierce plays Lenny, an insurance investigator who has lost the ability to make new memories after the rape/death of his wife, and he believes he has nothing to live for but revenge, so he tatoos and takes picutres of certain people and places to remember them as he searches for the man who killed and raped his wife. This film noir/psychological thriller has everything going for it: a great cast, witty dialogue, an ingenius narrative, and a music score that hits the nail on the head. The music sounds like an Angelo Badalamenti score, with its haunting synthesizers and sudden bursts of sound.Memento is a movie where you'll leave the theatre...thinking. Thinking alot. First you try to put things together, then you try to see behind the meaning of it all. I don't want to give to much away, but you'll walk out of that theatre with the strangest feeling in you.It leaves you confused, terrified, heartbroken, and finally enlightened. That's more emotions than an entire year of Hollywood movies can produce. I've seen this movie twice so far, and I'm ready to see it again. And again. Both times I walked out of a theatre deep in though about how much I loved this film.This movie gives me hope that there is life back in Hollywood Filmmaking. I had honestly never heard of it until my friend invited me to a viewing of it, and from the first image, I was hooked. This movies has a little bit of everything: a tragic love story, a murder mystery, black comedy and the like. Even if this movie doesn't do well in the theatres, it will pick up a major cult following, as well as several awards (I'm not talking about the Academy Awards...I gave up on them after Del Toro won for supporting actor). See this movie if you want to see one original, brilliant mystery film. 5 out of 5 in my book."

","OK, I haven't slogged through all 280 comments, so forgive me if this has been covered. I'm really getting annoyed with the people who perceive the ""plothole"" about Lenny remembering his condition. <br/><br/>Lenny presumably figured out what was wrong with him because he remembered handling Sammy's case. In other words, he had studied this condition in depth before his accident. He recognized his symptoms and remembered what he had learned about Sammy. (If Lenny had never heard of this condition, then he probably wouldn't be able to explain it.) He has a tattoo on his hand that reads ""Remember Sammy"". This is an easy way of triggering his memory. At MANY points in the film, he looks at the tattoo right after ""waking up"". Sammy WAS a real guy, even if Lenny got his story mixed up (don't want to get too far into spoiler territory here.) <br/><br/>There are so many greater mysteries in this movie (notably the last 10 seconds or so) that I'm amazed people get bogged down in this fairly straightforward plot device. I have seen the movie twice with different people. There is always much argument afterward, but none of my friends have questioned this particular point. If you don't like it, fine.

","When I walked out of the theater after viewing Memento I wasn't sure what to think. This movie kept me guessing at every turn and the final twist at the ending (or should I say beginning??) when everything came together was brilliant , moving, and refreshingly original. This whole movie gets major points in my book for being so original. From the opening sequence to the final credits, the viewer can't guess what is going to happen next. In fact, it is so hard to orient oneself in the movie that some people may be turned off by it. However, I enjoyed it thoroughly. <br/><br/>The director/writer Chris Nolan should be given a lot of credit for his great work. A must see movie that one must see several times to really understand the truth (if it can even be found). <br/><br/>There were some plot holes I noticed like how does he remember that he has a memory problem? And what exactly are the rules/time limit for how long he can keep his short term memory? These two things were never clear to me. Perhaps after repeated viewings I will find the answer to these questions?!?<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Good original screenplay, great directing, good acting, plenty of suspense, great plot twists, and high production values make this a great all around movie. <br/><br/>FINAL RATING: 9/10 Excellent original movie with few flaws that stands up to repeated viewings and breaks all genre boundaries."

","If you haven't seen the movie, you may be confused with my summary. Well, as you'll see within the first scene, the entire movie plays backwards chronologically.  I've seen many films that use the technique of mixing up the order of scenes, ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""The Sweet Hereafter,"" ""12 Monkeys,"" and of course the film that started it all, ""Citizen Kane,"" to name a few. However, never before has it been used to such perfection.  So, the first scene is the last, and the last scene is the first.  Or, is it?  As each scene begins, you learn more about the scene you just saw, and trying to figure out Leonard Shelby's (expertly played by Guy Pearce) justification behind his actions after the fact always keeps the audience guessing.  In this review, I don't want to give away all the plot lines or anything like that, I just wish to peak your interest so you will go see this excellent movie.  After seeing this film I think of the annoying song ""Closing Time,"" because the lyrics explain this perfectly.  They say, ""Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.""

In the end we know a lot more, but are left to argue with our movie going buddies about how much we do know and how much was part of a deliberate Rashomon like prism of reality set up by the screen play.<br/><br/>
It's probably a great movie to see again just to see the clues that we missed because we didn't know (yet) what to look for. <br/><br/>Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano do great supporting work, but Guy Pearce deserves an Oscar nomination for his wound up, confused but tough, desperate seeker of truth in all the wrong places."

","I don't know where to start! After coming out of the movie I was totally amazed, Memento WAS the BEST movie I had ever seen. But that wasn't why I was amazed it because... well it was told so perfectly it couldn't have been better. It was hard to follow but not too hard. The movie was told backwards. It was color and black and white the scenes in his motel room were black and white but the scenes out- side the motel room were in color. The end (not giving away any thing) which is the start is so weirdly presented and explained but after the movie you need to think about it because it is backwards. You have to think of it the other way around. But still I think there is more than one ending well not more than one ending but, you could talk to three different people who have seen Memento and they could all have different opinions of what the ending is! Ok I better tell you what this great movie is about! It's a bit hard to explain but I'll try. Leonard Shelby (Guy perice) was a successful businessman until his wife was killed, and that was when he got his short term memory he could hardly remember something that had happened three minutes ago. Now he lived in a motel room, getting up every morning thinking, where am I? Why am I here? The only things he has that can help him to remember things are his photos and tattoos. All leading him to his wife's killer that is all he tries to do, find his wife's killer! Will people take advantage of him? Go see the film and you will find out! A true master piece!

","""Memento"" featuring Guy Pearce (""L.A. Confidential"", ""Ravenous""), Carrie-Anne Moss (""The Matrix""), and Joe Pantoliano (""The Matrix"", ""The Sopranos"", ""Midnight Run"") is a superb murder mystery told in reverse. The main character (Pearce), whose wife was killed, investigates the evidence while handicapped with a condition that cripples his ability to make new memories.  As a result, he is living in a continuous flow of short-term memory that barely connects moments to each other.  To connect the evidence he collects and to trust it, he must make continuous notes which bear increasingly paranoid messages like ""DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE.""  Since we're connecting the dots backwards, we don't know any more about what's going on than he does.  This is the gambit on which the mystery hinges and it actually works beautifully.  The result is a film with continuous twists and surprises which allows you the joy and the puzzle of putting the entire story into context in your own mind.  Like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""The Sixth Sense"", it makes you want to see it again for clues you missed the first time around."

"tark-6","10","0","1","25 November 2000"," Incredible film, deep philosophy
","The technical expertise brought to bear on this film has produced one of the most awe-inspiringly skillful pieces of narrative experimentation that I have ever seen (for me, it blows The Usual Suspects out of the water, though that's a more fun and stylish film than this). It is quite exhilarating.<br/><br/>The choices of scene order and the editing were very intelligent and always hugely effective... the opening shot demonstrates this right away (I was in love with the film immediately because of it). The plot is entirely intelligible (replay it forwards in your mind afterwards and the sequence of events is surprisingly simple), which is quite a feat, and the obvious method for maintaining suspense in a film that starts with its ending - that is to lie a lot, Usual Suspects-style! - is employed in a smart and at times cheeky and humorous manner that works really well. You never feel cheated... or if you do, it's done so well that you love it!<br/><br/>Philosophy really seems to be invading mainstream cinema at the moment (which is something I and, it seems, the public in general, are enjoying a lot)... first The Matrix, now Memento. These two films share two actors (Pantoliano and Moss) and they also share a major philosophical issue - the existence (or otherwise) of a consistent objective reality. Memento, though (in my opinion), tackles a much deeper and more important point. This point, revealed at the end of the film (this is an analytical spoiler, not a plot one, but skip this paragraph if you care), is not just that we carry our worlds in our heads and that they could be made up by us or someone else, but that we *need* to believe in a world that is consistent and has purpose and meaning - and that this can make us waste our life trying to get it to make sense within the context of these abstract ideas.<br/><br/>Life is a series of moments of consciousness for all of us, whether we have a functioning memory or not. No matter what we do in the long run, it is how happy we are in each of these individual moments that counts - a life is not greater than the sum of its parts. A great, long-term achievement only makes life better by making individual moments happier (through pride, say) but such achievements do not necessarily bring a sufficient reward to balance their cost, as was the case in the extreme situation of Leonard.<br/><br/>Several people have complained about the lack of an 'emotional heart' to the film but I think that (a) it was present in Sammy's story (Harriet Harris is really, really good) and (b) this is part of the point. Leonard's choice to base his actions on belief in his 'purpose' (revenge) ensures that his life is hellish and never satisfying. An abstract purpose to life that extends beyond the individual moments of consciousness (their disconnectedness emphasised by Leonard's condition but present in all of us) is what many of us seem to follow, yet we do it without any proof that it will make our moments any happier in the long run. We can become obsessed with purpose and life 'making sense' at the expense of happiness. I know that this is true of me :(  my life is uncannily similar to Leonard's... umm, just without all the killing!"

","As soon as you leave the theatre, you'll begin to insist on knowing how on Earth a human being concocted such an enormously complex web of a story, translated it perfectly to film, and then had the gall to completely mess with the whole way time works.<br/><br/>Memento is a lot like other ""Never Saw It Coming"" twist-ending movies in that you will most definitely enjoy multiple viewings.  The odd part is that the twist should be a total give-away the whole time.  You'll feel fooled by the shock at the end and demand to know everything that you had just seen all over again.<br/><br/>This is exactly why this premise works.  Instead of telling the story sequentially, Memento takes you through the bassackwards world of Lenny, learning for the first time things that have happened already.  It leads to some great moments, like when he is being chased/chasing Dodd.  Don't know what I mean?  Go see the movie!<br/><br/>The ending is the story though, so it isn't like a gimmick, it is entirely essential.  The trick ending to the Sixth Sense could have not been and most of the entire plot would remain the same.  In Memento, the twist ending is the entire point of the movie, and all of the characters actually interact with this inevitability.<br/><br/>So out of four stars I give it ****.  A perfect film."

It is an amazing film that will leave you thinking about it for days and maybe even longer. This is the most interesting and original film to come out in years. I won't bother with telling the plot because I'm sure by now you know it thanks to all the comments on here. I will say that the ""major plot hole"" that some people talk about (referring to how he remembers that he has this condition) is easily explained by the tattoo on his hand that reads ""remember sammy jankis"". Sammy Jankis is a man who Guy Pearce checked out as an insurance investigator that claimed to have the same condition. Pearce was constantly looking at the tattoo throughout the movie therefore being reminded of the condition. But if people want to get really picky about all the details then there are plenty of questions that could be asked about this film...which is something you could do with any film. I prefer to look at it as just a movie, and a very excellent one at that."

","In a nutshell : is this a fantastic film (if you want to see an intelligent, thoughtful film, this is as good as it gets).  This film makes you think, it IS confusing at the start (and the less you know before seeing it the better), and slowly as the story unfolds (in reverse) you get to see the full picture, and that process of YOU having to work it out is what makes the film greater.  You get Lenny's perspective, you get how he sees reality, any other way of filming would not have had so much an impact.  There are many twists and turns, almost everything gets explained (but go to the official site afterwards AFTERWARDS, which should fill in the blanks - its very well done too). All the actors were great, the characters in it were real, each has their own human agendas (good and bad).  Sets / Filming / Editing / Soundtrack (bonus of a David Bowie song at credit time) / Technical stuff - faultless.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that this film did not get the full public release coverage it so rightly deserves (UK), I found out about it by accident, why was this?  Do films that make people think take a back seat to no-brainer CGI junk that we get flooded with now?  What other films have I missed because of this?<br/><br/>Now stop reading now and go see it, as I will say something that aint a real spoiler, but everyone is whining about it (which may put people off from seeing it) so : Lenny has conditioned himself (Unlike Sammy who could not) on how to behave (look in pockets for photos, read notes, make notes,tattoos, take photos which helps subsitute for his memory) (Its all in the film).  Anyway, have you seen it yet?  When is it on DVD?"

","""Memento"" is quite possibly the most amazing film experience I've had in a movie theater (I've seen ""Citizen Kane"" and ""2001"" only on video).  I daresay (though there is not much risk involved) I will not see a better movie this year, and I say this even with my excitement over the upcoming ""AI"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring.""  ""Memento"" is a remarkably complex, beautiful, blistering, masterpiece of a movie.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone everywhere in the world.  I am not even going to comment on the plot, because I think you should go in totally fresh as I did and willing to take an active interest in the movie.  This is not your typical popcorn machine movie, where the plot is easy enough that you can fall asleep through half of it and still know what's going on.  ""Memento"" transcends what going to the movies is all about: its complexity and method of storytelling make it almost some kind of a revolutionary audience participation spectacle.  It's twists and turns are not gimmicky like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Fight Club"" but gradual and calculated.  I can not possibly sing this movie's praises enough, so now I am going to give a word to its detractors: LEARN TO THINK AT THE MOVIES.  Stop watching Candycorn Crap like ""Bring it On"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" and invest in a movie that has ideas and wants to challenge you.<br/><br/>ALSO: a major complaint (read no further if you want to go into the movie fresh) is that the film's method of backwards storytelling is just a gimmick and that the movie would not be as interested if it went from start to finish in regular order.  Well, gee, thanks!  I didn't realize that watching a movie the way it's intended to be watched is more entertaining than watching it backwards.  You can also make the argument that watching ""The Bicycle Thief"" in rewind isn't as entertaining as watching it the way it was filmed.  DUH!  Of course, the backwards chronology is essential to the plot: the idea is to distort reality and confuse identity.  The movie is like looking in a mirror where everything is distorted and backwards.  You're not supposed to grasp all this in one sitting.  Just think about it a while after you leave the theater and you should understand.  For those of you who haven't seen it, though, GO SEE IT NOW!  I beg you.<br/><br/>Px"
"Numchuck","10","0","2","5 May 2001"," Definitely one to think about
","This remarkable film has drawn obvious comparisons to The Usual Suspects, not because of the content of the film, but because of the delivery.  Like The Usual Suspects, Memento revels in leading the audience down one path of apparent certainty before taking a sudden sprint down another to confuse and disorientate, but more importantly to question what has come before.  Is what you have just seen only 15 or so minutes before real? Can anybody be trusted? And what do we really know about Leonard?<br/><br/>This is the true beauty of the film, not only does it present a character who himself is an, albeit empathetic, enigma, but it forces the audience to feel exactly what this character is feeling.  The short, sharp bursts of information which is contradicted, then re-inforced, then contradicted once again to provide a list of characters whose motivations are at all times unclear puts us in exactly the same predicament that Leonard is in.  Who if anyone in this film is telling the truth, the whole story? And who can we trust?<br/><br/>This is a film which demands a second viewing to begin to come to any level of understanding, and even then you will find yourself reaching for the rewind button to try and reach a further understanding.  The key to remember is that this film is intended to be ambiguous, there is no real answer to the questions that you will find yourself asking.  Has Leonard finally found his man, has he killed before and most importantly does the man he is looking for actually exist? We simply don't know, and why? Because we learn only what Leonard learns and know only what Leonard knows which ultimately is nothing more than a few scribbled notes and images to fill in the pieces of a much larger puzzle.<br/><br/>This film demands viewing by anyone with an interest in film for the simple fact that it is an incredibly powerful example of the power of the medium. The majority of films present a story in a neat little package nicely wrapped up, if not necessarily for the protagonists, certainly for the viewer.  This film does not on either count and requires a level of concentration and involvement from the audience that will make you forget entirely that this is only a film, a piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the Memento website provides some clues in answering the mystery that are not provided in the film.  Leonard's wife is definitely killed in the attack at his home and not, as Teddy would have us believe, at a later date by Leonard.  However, the site lends much creedence to the notion that Leonard has killed several times before and then consciously or other wise, destroyed the evidence. It also informs us that Leonard has spent a great deal of time (nearly 2 years)in psychiatric care trying to recover from his condition, undergoing many of the same tests used on Sammy Jankis.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film 10/10 and would advise anybody to go and see it and experience a rare treat, a true cinematic gem."

","A buddy of mine went to see memento and commented on how utterly horrible it was. This is coming from someone who considers Quentin Tarrantino-esque movies are paramount and anything other is a fake or a bad movie. This is also coming from someone who went to the restroom during the movie one time. Let me just say that if you go to the restroom, pick up your keys, look into your box of candy, sneeze, blink, or otherwise remove your eyes from the screen for any more than 3 seconds then you have just wasted your time and money. This movie is not for the inattentive and restless. You must focus all of your attention unto the story that is jigsawed before you. This masterfully directed movie makes me wonder why hasn't this been done before? The answer is as simple as this. To make a movie of this caliber takes a director who works hand in hand with the writer. In this case Christopher Nolan is both director and writer and displays pure genius in the way that the movie is not written straight through from the beginning to end. The best way to describe the format and styling would be a backwards ""leapfrog"" approach. That's as simply as you can put a movie as complex as this one. It is a mystery and drama that makes you feel sorry for Leonard, the main character. Without saying too much he has a mental condition where he cannot create new memories and has a short term memory problem where even five minute conversations fade just as quickly as the scenes leapfrog around each other. Combine all of this with some serious twists and turns will leave you dumbfounded in the best meaning of the word. It is truly a masterful work which needs to be seen to be believed. My congratulations to Mr. Nolan for making the most unique and captivating motion picture around."

But we had no idea what we were in for.<br/><br/>This movie is possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It's not perfect, no.  It's long, involved, and forces you to think.  But, in a sea of mediocre films that seem to reflect each other more and more with less and less originality and storyline, Memento is its own little tropical island.  I honestly never would have imagined that a movie done the way this movie was done could have been pulled off as well as it was.  You see, the secret about Memento is, you see the end at the beginning, the beginning at the end, the entire movie is told backwards, and the surprise is not where you end up, but rather where you began.<br/><br/>I won't say any more other than to say I find it a shame that movies such as Memento get locked away in art house theaters, rarely getting the public attention they deserve.

Flawless acting, mesmerising narrative, stunning plot device - this film really is high concept - but with other films which simply rely on a fancy plot, all other factors usually suffer, but not with ""Memento"". Guy Pearce is a revelation (I remember him from ""Neighbours"") and both Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano erase all possibility of ""The Matrix"" being all anyone will remember them for. There are few films that the second the credits roll I've rewound the tape and watched straight through again, and even fewer that I've done out of choice.

","Fight club meets the usual suspects, well not really, comparing Memento to such excellent movies as Fight Club and the Usual Suspects, still wouldn't do it justice.  Christopher Nolan has created a cinematic materpiece, a thriller, that puts you so close to the edge of your seat that at times you have to pick yourself off the ground. It may be a bold statement, and I am willing to take some heat for it, but the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock, could get out his ball point(god rest his soul)and takes some note on Nolan's suspense filled story.<br/><br/>The story is about Lenny a man who has short term memory and uses poloroids, tattoo's and notes to remember what he is doing.  What he knows for sure is someone raped and killed his wife, and he has clues in various places of his body to help him solve the crime. Anyway, what creates the great suspense in this movie is that we too experience a short term memory, and we are given the plot backwards.  AT the beginning of the film Lenny has already found the killer, and we get to see what happens building up to the end,piece, by piece.  It is very original, and I can guarantee that it will have a couple oscar nominations attached to its name a year from now.  Well I will not bother trying to do this film any more justice by trying to explain it in this feeble review.  I will just say this movie will blow you away.  Nolan has broken many conventions with this movie most notably how to tell a good mystery something that has been lacking in hollywood since.....The Usual Suspects, oh did I mention this is better.

","Very clever, spooky thriller that is actually run backwards, so that each event that takes place on screen actually unfolded prior to what you just saw.  The director- Chris Nolan (INSOMNIA) - uses this device to unwrap a mystery: our protagonist is looking for a killer, but he is afflicted by a strange condition that prevents him from retaining information for mor ethan a few minutes at a time. He can't remember where he's been or what he's just done, so the backwards-plot angle makes the viewer oddly in sync with the protaginist - we don't what he's just done, either.  Ambiguous until the end, this is a masterful detective story - every detail is imbued with significance, though we often don't realize it until later.  The lead character is played by Guy Pearce, the fiercely honorable and intelligent cop in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL - here, he has the same kind of mission for justice thing going, but he's flying blind here, unable to remember or trust anyone and ultimately unsure even of his own motives.  Pearce didn't come across      It's a dizzying tale - fractured, repetitive, cryptic, disorienting - just the way that film noir is supposed to be."

I don't like the idea of some director filming a movie, going into the editing room and saying to himself, ""Self, I can make this movie as complicated and bas-ackwards as I can and people will love it.""  Usually the movie ends up being downright unconvincing.  This movie was none of the above.  It's got twists and turns aplenty.  Because the movie is backwards.  Driving your car backwards will end up with a twisting ride.  Same with this movie.  When a scene is tense to begin with, you know that in ten minutes the experience will be recreated the same way, to perfection.  One of the best examples of classic film-making I've witnessed to date."

I am not even going to talk about the plot because if you are seeing this you probably know what Memento is about.  The 3 lead actors give outstanding performances, especially Guy Pierce, who should be a favorite for the Oscar next year.  This is the best movie since Pulp Fiction and is now in my Top 10.

One surely 'might' know why: propaganda to sell copies of your magazine; or perhaps a way to make your limited film knowledge fans regurgitate your pointless review to their friends--to look smart of course!<br/><br/>Fortunately, this film makes up for the poor reviewers. This movie is certainly the best film I've seen since 'Amores Perros' in Guadalajara, MX. Movie makers are still on the edge of making 'cognitive' movies: Being John Malkovich, Requiem for A Dream, Memento. What about the Sixth Sense?? Well, while it's a fine film, the sixth sense makes the viewer say ""ah hah!"" or ""oh my god!"" Memento and Requiem make the viewer feel something viceral: you might say ""that sucks, I'm sure glad I'm not..."", but it makes you feel for the narrator(s). Memento, especially the opening rewind shot, gets the viewer into Pearce's point of view: you try to think as he does.<br/><br/>Hopefully, if you read this review, you'll take my advice: try to figure out the movie on your own, don't worry about reviewers, esp. me.<br/><br/>-If you haven't seen the movie, don't read below-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The movie revolves around Pearce ""conditioning"" himself to believe false ""facts.""

","If you understood my summary line, then you'll get this movie. There has been reviews for this that have painted this movie as exceptional and a must see movie, and they would be right, but i would like to point out two things. One, you will understand it, and that realisation when it comes will put a huge smile on your face, as when the movie plays, (and it does play backwards in segments that link together) you start to figure it out. The other is that it has no resemblance to The sixth sense whatsoever. When it comes to plot twists, i would compare it more to The usual suspects. What we have here is a truly unique movie, one that cannot be faulted in any department, which, due to the nature of the story, will have you on tenterhooks til its closing (or opening) frame. I simply cannot recommend this movie enough, and if you feel im not writing much on its story its because its hard to talk about the plot without giving it all away, and it IS better if you figure it out for yourself. So read no more reviews, get the movie, heat the popcorn, and enjoy...the conversations after the movie will be intense..."

","I really liked Memento the first time I saw it, but knew that the real test of a movie like this is if it holds up on a second viewing.  I'm pleased to say it does.  With the attendant hype, most everyone knows enough about the plot to forgo rehashing it here.  But I must urge those who have seen it to give it another viewing:  so many little lines and situations have such resonance when you know all the movie's secrets (which I won't spoil).  It is most interesting on second viewing to pay close attention to the characters of Natalie and Teddy, as they are the most inscrutable; while they still have great mystery and complexity, it's fun--knowing what you know the second time around--to watch their brains click along and get a better grip on their motives.  And not trying to sort out the mystery gives one a better opportunity to savor Guy Pierce's subtle, amazing performance; he is strangely pragmatic about his situation, yet infused with sadness. Not only do I HIGHLY recommend Memento, I recommend it even more as a repeat experience."

The story line is extremely luring, you're drawn into the plot in the first scene. Humour is subtle, but definitely there. This film lacks definition which is very effective.

","Some people who have commented on 'Memento' state that it is too complex for its own good. I suppose this is an understandable response from an audience that are used to nothing more than mindless spectacle and CGI dynamics.  In an era where cinema output has been notably and depressingly dumbed down, with crass comedies such as Scary Movie being flavour of the moment, it is heartening to see a film which is almost perfect in every department being made. In terms of writing, direction, editing and performance, you'll be hard pushed to find a film this good being released all year. From the atmospheric opening to the frantic and utterly satisfying climax, this film is a revelation. The experimentation with narrative structure may demand your undivided attention, but I fail to see anything that is wrong with that. As the plot builds and the details of Guy Pearce's characters dilemma are slowly revealed, the attentive viewer will fail to be anything other than fully absorbed in the story that is unfolding. This is truly inspirational film making and it is destined for classic status in years to come."

","Memento is a rare film: limited release, yet in the tradition of such modern classics as Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects.  It has everything a movie needs for success:  moderate star-power, mystery, and little advertisement save an incredible web site and word-of-mouth. However, little advertisement has not hurt this film, it has actually helped.  People will continue to flock to theaters to see this movie because its trailer is not widely shown, and, therefore, little is known of its plot.  This mystery, as well as rave reviews, is all the hype the film needs.  After seeing the film, viewers leave in awe.  Awe from the confusion they have concerning the plot, awe from their own realization of certain aspects of the plot, awe from the realization that someone has made a film the way the motion picture was first intended to be made:  innovative film shots that grab the audience's attention, and a story that never loses interest in the eyes of the audience.  Memento is ""The Godfather"" of independent film-making.  Hell, Memento is this year's best picture.....so far....."

","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>I hate it when I feel totally different about a flick than does everyone else, but I must confess that I was not that fond of Memento. Sure, the idea of structuring the film so that it runs backwards is clever. Even the premise of the effects of memory loss on the attempt at revenge is smart. However, the movie was so complicated that it totally ruined the enjoyment of the experience. It was like reading a complicated novel that requires you to re-read every line to make some sense of it...I always think the author (or in this case the screenwriter) is simply trying to show off his/her intelligence.The result is simply too tedious. I was worn out after this movie and fairly glad it was over. By the way, would someone e-mail me and tell me why, after he killed the first(last)guy he didn't simply write himself a note to remind him that his task was complete and that he didn't need to search any longer????"

Most of the time the twist can be predicted even before the director tells us the twist. This is NOT the case in Memento.  Instead of being a viewer, we experience the same problem as the main character.  The editing process does this.

It is a film about adultery that was made in 1983 and is done superbly.  The sitcom Seinfeld even did a spoof of this movie in one of its final episodes as each following scene was an event that happened previously in time.

","After viewing MEMENTO for the first time, I left the theater with the same questions as most others seem to have.

It is all there for us to see, there are no ""goofs"" and certainly no holes in the plot, just our minds' confusion. Once you actually understand the whole plot, you will indeed be able to appreciate the complexity with which Mr. Nolan takes us to it. There is so much to digest the first time around. Besides, the fun of the film is arguing about it with others ( until one person finally does understand it ).

"Croftman","Null","0","1","1 May 2001"," Lest we forget...
","There are so many attempts on this Board at unravelling the plot of this film and I think the answer lies in understanding the truth of what happens at the start of the story, -which is the end of the film.<br/><br/>Here is my interpretation of just this particular section:<br/><br/>*****WARNING: SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Leonard is an Insurance Investigator. Two drug addicts murder Leonard's wife. He manages to shoot one, but the other gets away.  In the process, Leonard ends up with brain damage causing the loss of his short-term memory.<br/><br/>Teddy, a bent Cop, eventually tracks the killer down and Leonard subsequently murders him as an act of revenge. Because he knows that Leonard will not remember any of this, Teddy takes a Polaroid of Leonard while he's still covered in the guy's blood. However, this serves no purpose, because Leonard still doesn't remember this act of revenge. Because of his impairment, the process of bereavement cannot unfold and therefore everyday that Leonard awakes, the need for enacting revenge on his wife's killer is as powerful as the last. Teddy uses Leonard's hunger for vengeance for his own ends, and Leonard ends up killing an innocent man. When he eventually finds out, he is mad at Teddy and decides to mark him down as the killer instead by giving himself cryptic clues to Teddy's pseudo-identity as the assassin. Thereby giving Leonard fuel to pour on his burning desire for retribution.<br/><br/>Frustratingly, there is also a possibility that Leonard himself killed his wife with an insulin overdose, and then used his memory loss to his advantage by transposing this deed onto another person named Sammy Jankis. (Teddy tells Leonard at the end of the film, that Jankis didn't have a wife!) So where otherwise did this memory come from?<br/><br/>The whole storyline evolves from this beginning, but because the tale is filmed in reverse, the above becomes the climax rather than the commencement. It is always refreshing to see an intelligent film. My local cinema wouldn't touch it, preferring instead to show such gems as `Dude Have You Seen My Car' Another movie which features memory loss  but mainly brain cell loss in its audience.<br/><br/>Memento: 9/10"

","A lot of the time people are given to hyperbole when they see a good film at the cinema. 'It was fantastic...brilliant...best film I've seen in ages.' The real test is if the film sticks in your head. I saw Memento three months ago, and as soon as it is available to rent on video I will be first in line for a copy.<br/><br/>The story concerns a man named Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce aka Ed Exley from LA Confidential, Mike from Neighbours), who as a consequence of witnessing his wifes rape and murder has lost his short term memory. He can only remember moments after this event in fifteen minute periods. Afterwards he forgets everything. He is trying to find his wifes killer, but the clues he gathers are not in his head. They are maps, diagrams, Polaroid photos, and tattoos of names and places which cover his body. He needs to rearrange this information to find the killer.<br/><br/>This could have been a very straightforward thriller, but in the hands of director Christopher Nolan it becomes a film which will mess with your mind for weeks after viewing. The editing and cinematography really contribute to an air of extreme paranoia, as do the peformances of the actors (including the delectable Carrie-Anne Moss).<br/><br/>In my view it was a scandal that this film was not exhibited in time for the Oscar nominations.

"Philby-3","Null","0","2","28 April 2001"," Film Noir in Reverse Gear
","`The Arabians learn Arabian with the speed of summer lightning And the Hebrews learn it backwards which is absolutely frightening'.<br/><br/>I don't know whether writer-director Christopher Nolan is Hebrew or Arabian (Arabic is also written from right to left) but he has made effective use of inverting the usual procedure of telling the story from beginning to end. You'd think it would be hard to maintain tension in a thriller when we know at the start who did what to whom, but you are kept on your toes by the necessity to work out just how each succeeding scene fits in to the previous one (which is the one later in time  got that?)<br/><br/>The other bit of artifice is Leonard Shelby's loss of short term memory. This is certainly an odd ailment since he is clearly able to concentrate on what he is doing eg taking his aide-memoire polaroids, making love or killing someone in revenge for his wife's murder, not to mention finding where he parked his Jaguar, yet he cannot remember what happens from scene to scene  we the audience, running backwards in time, have to do that for him. He conditions himself to `remember' some things and, being a well-organised fellow with his photos, notes and tattoos, copes a bit better than the unlucky Sammy Jankis he met in his previous life as an insurance investigator.<br/><br/>The actual plot is pretty mundane  innocent victim of drug-related crime, man out for revenge, shady beauty helping, bent cop using man for own ends - but is very effectively packaged and well acted out. Guy Pearce as Leonard spends a lot of the time in his underwear, but, cutely good-looking as he is, he does a brilliant job of inciting our sympathies even as we realise that a man who can't remember killing someone is a very dangerous person indeed. John Pantoliano as Teddy the bent cop is relentlessly amiable even as it becomes clear he is up to no good. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie the drug dealer's girlfriend who helps Guy for her own reasons has a careworn beauty that transcends her commonplace lines and foul language.<br/><br/>The action is not too hard to follow and the suspense is maintained until the end. The only slightly puzzling feature was the use of some sepia sequences  one scene really, running forward in time but broken up and scattered through the film. It didn't seem to add much to the action though it provided some of the explanation as to who Guy had got where he was.<br/><br/>
Altogether, an interesting variation of the film noir revenge genre. I couldn't help thinking, though it was a bit like watching someone drive their car with great facility round an obstacle course and high speed in reverse gear. Impressive, but all a bit artificial."

It's simply a terrific film with a original idea (how rare is that these days!), superb direction and acting from all three leads.  It grabs your attention from the first scene and never lets go. If you are a fan of film noir, you really owe it to yourself to see this movie.  The idea for the film itself is clever, but the stroke of genius the way the story is told - from the last scene backwards.  As if that isn't enough, there are additional scenes filmed in black and white which fill in much of the details of the story as you go along.  This is truly impressive work.  I was lucky enough to see Christopher Nolan's other film - the short but very well done Following.

It captures your attention by the way that it puts you practically in Leonard's condition by telling the story backwards.  When I saw that someone had been killed in the beginning (or the end of the story, rather), I thought to myself that it was no fun because I already knew who the bad guy was.  But that was the exact OPPOSITE of what I came to believe after the next two hours.  Although this movie does leave quite a few unanswered questions, this feeling of wonder as the movie ends is almost comforting, because you can make up your own ending to the story and what YOU think actually happened.  I recommend that anyone who has seen this movie visit the website at otnemem.com.  You will find out even more information to pique your curiosity.<br/><br/>
Now for the **SPOILERS**.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I have been thinking about this movie and what happened in it during the past 24 hours and think I understand, but maybe could use a bit of help from anyone else willing to offer it.  In my opinion, Leonard and his wife were attacked in their home and Leonard was left with his condition.  He tattooed ""remember Sammy Jankis"" as a reminder to himself to pass of his own situation as someone else's.  This is a memory that he always remembered to share with others due to this reminder.  The diabetes situation was actually his own and his wife died from an insulin overdose.  He set off to find his wife's ""murderer"" so he could erase guilt of causing her death from the insulin (I'm unsure about if he would even feel guilt because of his condition).  I believe that Teddy and Jimmy were in the drug business together and Teddy set Jimmy up to be killed by Leonard.  Natalie found out and helped Leonard onto the trail of Teddy (more than he had already helped himself).  I'm still a bit fuzzy on the whole Dodd situation. <br/><br/>
***Questions: There was one scene in the movie where they showed Sammy in the mental institution, and, maybe it was just me, but for a BRIEF SECOND I could SWEAR that they imposed Leonard sitting in the institute just where Sammy had been sitting.  From what it says on the website, Leonard was in a mental institution.  Did anyone else see this?<br/><br/>Another thing that I think I saw near the end of the movie... the polariod that Leonard received under the door of the hotel showed him smiling and pointing at a spot on his chest.  For a brief second as he was flashing back to thoughts of his wife, she was curled up on his chest and the tattoo ""I DID IT"" could be seen in that very spot.  Did anyone else see THIS? <br/><br/>
Bottom line: Great movie, very original, and way intriguing. 9/10"

","Christopher Nolan deserves points for not only building on a clever premise, but providing a great deal of drama and comedy, without ever destroying the overall tone of the movie.  The 'beginning at the end' approach really sucks you in, and it is easy to see how it could have been a disaster in the wrong hands.  <br/><br/>Nolan is aided by three terrific primary actors -- Guy Pearce brings a tricked up intensity to his role -- part Ed Exley (his L.A. CONFIDENTIAL character) and part a guy who is both frustrated by his situation, yet still sees some humor in it.  Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Panitalano (sp.?) are likewise outstanding, particularly Moss, whose character shifts tones a few times as the plot progresses backwards.<br/><br/>However, the ending of the movie is part of THE USUAL SUSPECTS school, which many people, judging by the ratings, apparently love.  For me, the ending, like that of USUAL SUSPECTS is a screenwriter cheat -- perhaps moreso here. Instead of building to a logical conclusion (or a logical beginning?), the ending is decidedly random in a manner that suggests more that Nolan didn't know how to end the story, rather than providing a true resolution.  When screenwriters get into this 'playing god' mode, I wish that maybe they'd try to pull a page out of the literary playbooks of Flann O'Brien and Alasdair Gray, and set up a confrontation between the lead character and the writer, who ultimately determines the character's fate.<br/><br/>This is essentially an terrific bunch of magic tricks.<br/><br/>

","I'm not going to say anything about the plot, except that it involves a man with short-term memory, Leonard (Guy Pearce). If you hear too much about the plot, it will ruin the experience.<br/><br/>Now, this movie is one of the most beautifully crafted films ever made, the way it is shoot, the music and especially the directing by Christopher Nolan. The performances of Guy Pearce (Leonard) and Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) are absolutely brilliant. Carrie-Ann Moss (Natalie) is also good, but not brilliant. The way this film is told is so original and new, that I can't tell you, you have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>The reason this film is so good, is that something like this has never been done before and I think movie fans such as myself, have been waiting for a movie like Memento that is so original, its finally good to see something different instead of all those stupid teen horrors, romantic comedy's and over budget action films, and so on, well you get my point.<br/><br/>Memento is now in my favourite 10 films of all-time. So go out there and see this film, you won't be disappointed I promise. The ending will shock you, just as it did in The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>10/10, 2 thumbs up, *****stars"
"RolloTomasi","10","0","1","25 April 2001"," Write yourself a note: ""See Memento""
","`Memento' is the first film of 2001 that matters. Hopefully it won't be the last. It's about a guy who loses his short-term memory after sustaining a head injury trying to prevent his wife's murder. He remembers who he is, his entire life before it happened. His lone objective is to find the man responsible for the last new memory he ever made: the death of his wife. He believes he can do this because memory is unreliable anyway. The facts are not. In order to continue knowing the facts, he writes himself notes. He writes notes on Polaroid photos. He has some of these notes made into tatoos (and you thought your mom was bad for leaving those annoying reminder notes all over the house).<br/><br/>The film's subject is memory, but it also proves to be a monumental test of the audience's memory. Mr. Nolan takes conventional film storytelling apart in a way no one has ever seen. In doing so he breathes new life into the entire film medium. `Memento' is any dedicated film-goer's Ultimate Challenge. Anyone who fully grasps everything that goes on in this thing on first viewing deserves the Handsome Reward. Don't plan on propping up your feet and relaxing if you go see this. Prepare to actually use your noggin or come away lost.<br/><br/>Beginning a film at the end is a convention that's almost over-used by directors these days, but never has a film begun at the last scene, then the next to the last scene, and on and on. The final scene is the very beginning of the story. You ask, well where's the suspense then? Just see it. Nolan isn't just trying to be clever either (but ends up being very VERY clever anyway). Telling it backwards is his way of putting us in Leonard's head. Any time a scene begins, we have no idea what's going on (again, not new to the film medium). We have to figure it out as it goes, the same way Leonard Shelby (`L.A. Confidential's Guy Pearce) has to.<br/><br/>For two hours the film gets more and more captivating, but also more and more mentally taxing. It's a real test of a person's capacity to pay attention to details and, well, to remember things. Not everyone is going to be looking for this kind of experience in the movie they bought a ticket for, which is fine. But I think anyone (except children of course) can get something out of it.<br/><br/>The story Nolan just happens to tell backwards isn't any more complex than a good thriller should be, that is, after your mind takes it apart and reconstructs it. This will be a must-own DVD when it comes out. At least then I'll have the option, just once, of starting at the end and watching it in chronological order by the miracle of the back' and next' buttons. By then I'm sure I'll have seen it a few more times. <br/><br/>Grade: A"
"b-a-h TNT-6","9","0","1","24 April 2001"," Forget the hyped sequel with brains but without any real brain - Memento is the thriller you should see!
","Memento is one of the best debuts that I'm aware of, and a remarkable achievement for a relatively low-budget film. Once again, in a film industry that too often forgets that only hype doesn't make a good movie, it's nice to see that some director has the courage to try something different, something that might not make a huge commercial success but will feel fresh when the big names will feel tiresome and dated.<br/><br/>The technique of starting the movie near the end, then flashing back, then back again was recently used in Fight Club, but Memento takes it to a whole new level. Although the film does remind of Fincher's violent satire at times, including for the use of a visual twist, it is clearly no clone. Where Fight Club is psycho-political bite, Memento is full paranoia through an extremely complicated yet gripping storyline that requires tremendous attention to the details. I won't give much of the plot away; it suffice to say that the movie explores the psychological sphere of a man looking for someone who did wrong to his family. Only problem, he suffered major damage in the event and can't make any new memories. How can he find who's looking for? Can he trust the people around him? And can he really trust his own data? Not only Memento will surprise you, confuse you, and even make you smile, but will raise questions about the true nature of our mind, about time, and about how we judge people.<br/><br/>In a year that saw Russell Crowe's name in every magazine, Guy Pearce proves he's definitely worth the same attention. His strong performance puts him in the league of young, talented actors with an already incredible career... Benicio Del Toro, Edward Norton, Guy Pearce...<br/><br/>So far I've seen the movie only once but I won't forget to see again!"

","An expertly-crafted screenplay, and another great performance by Guy Pearce. L.A. Confidential really impressed me, not only for the plot and style, but for Pearce's American accent.  Once again, I'm impressed.  Memento is one of the best films I've seen in years - a film people will be talking about for a long time.<br/><br/>Granted, it won't appeal to a lot of people because of its complexity and the fact that it leaves the viewer with several unanswered questions.  But let's forget the average viewer - they wouldn't know plot if it grabbed them by the brain and smacked them, and they can't understand the appeal of any film without a standard hollywood ending.<br/><br/>Memento is entertaining, intriguing, disturbing, and even funny at times. Unfortunately, there were several people in the audience who laughed EVERY time Leonard forgot something, whether it was funny or not.  (Probably the same people who laughed uncontrollably during Crouching Tiger every time someone jumped or flew.)<br/><br/>Anyhow, Memento is well worth seeing, and if you don't have a good theatre near you that shows independent films, I highly suggest making the drive to the nearest city to see Memento in the theatre rather than waiting to rent it."

","Guy Pearce is a showcase of paranoia and confusion in Memento, director Christopher Nolan's dizzying onscreen jigsaw puzzle that plunges the audience into a mesmerizing web of intrigue, obsession, and deceit.<br/><br/>Memento is a film noir that offers a strikingly original premise.  Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, an ex-insurance investigator whose wife was murdered while he lay unconscious from a head injury.  The injury, as it turns out, is catastrophic: he can no longer form new memories and only remembers everything before the attack.  The story makes for a bevy of confusion as the viewer frantically tries to size up each character, along with Pearce attempting to do the same.<br/><br/>To say more of the plot would be doing the film a disservice.  It's a rare cinematic experience where you actually struggle with a character and question everything that you've just seen.  Engrossing from its beginning, it never fails to stun in its complexity - not only running itself backwards (we begin the movie at the end and work backwards to a jolting, brilliant beginning) - but also including flashbacks and a separate scene in which Pearce explains his condition, both running tantamount with the main story. Nolan has crafted a unique cerebral teaser in Memento that asks the viewer to partake in the chaotic madness and continues to haunt and ask questions after its brilliant finale, not only about what has just happened onscreen but also questions the concept of memory and what we choose to believe has happened in the past even if our memory isn't totally clear.<br/><br/>Technically, the film stays true to the film noir genre: desolate, bleak, dark, and colorless.  The cinematography is handled with jagged splicing and the visual style employed is central conveying the jumbled, boggled mind of Pearce's character.  We think we see things, clues are embedded in split second frames assailed at the viewer in bursts of haze.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce gives us his best performance in Shelby, seamlessly getting lost in the profundity of his character's obsessive-compulsive pit.  His quiet, understated performance is tragic, heartfelt, entrancing, menacing, and fascinating in his calculating coldness and tender remembrances.  Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano both turn in twisted and wonderfully ambiguous performances as people involved in Pearce's quest for revenge. Surprisingly, we never see the pair onscreen even though the two supporting actors previously worked on The Matrix.<br/><br/>In a time where CGI and special effects seem to be ruling in theaters, Memento reminds us what truly makes a fantastic and truly memorable cinematic experience: innovative storytelling and interesting, sympathetic characters.  We needn't see explosions to be entertained, or cars chasing each other at ridiculous speeds, or extraneous gunplay.  Not only does the masterpiece that is  Memento manage to pull out the rug from its audience and be incredibly intelligent, it manages to raise questions where other films might simply be content to provide two hours of mindless diversion. Memento is anything but mindless and will have you guessing hours after the credits have rolled and is one of the year's best films.<br/><br/>10 out 10"
"ajax-12","Null","0","2","23 April 2001"," A Film Noir Rubic's Cube
","The cinematic equivalent of walking across a street filled with cars running red lights while carrying two bags of groceries and having someone walking beside you telling you that he is an eccentric millionaire and wishes to write you a check for a million dollars. In fact, an appropriate title for this film would have had as many words as the previous sentence, for ""Memento"" is much too simple a concept for this movie's storyline, which zigs and zags and goes backwards and forwards so much you will need a bottle of Advil and some ice. But even if you do walk away from the theater with a painful headache from all the confusion -- and I guarantee you you WILL be confused when the lights go up -- by all means try this brain teaser. There are too many movies out there that give away everything in the first ten minutes -- or even during the previews! And even if this film isn't entirely satisfying -- I think the ""My wife is dead and I must take revenge"" premise should be banned from movies for the next ten years -- it's still refreshing to be challenged and forced to work on a movie as you are watching it. Performances all around are first rate and the cinematography is excellent. But, really, all of that takes second place to the game that is this movie."
"b.schilling","10","0","1","11 November 2000"," An astonishingly original and vivid piece of cinema
","Memento is a dazzling piece of cinema, certainly one of the top three films of the year, if not Number One. It amazes, dazzles, infuriates, shocks, thrills in a virtuoso display of filmmaking craft. The premise is handled with supreme dexterity by Christopher Nolan in his sophomore effort (his debut being the little-seen Following) and the acting, particularly from a never-better Pearce is outstanding. Laced with a hint of dry, black humour, this film noir (chiefly set, ironically, in the daytime) is a brutal, mesmerising film. See it, but see it cold - the less you know before you enter the theatre the better (hence a lack of plot giveaways in this comment). With any luck, Memento will be remembered as one of the finest films of 2000, and the DVD could well be one of 2001's must-buys."

I really enjoyed the fact that you had to have your memory fine-tuned while watching it and even then, things slipped by that will require a second viewing, or a third...or a fourth...or a...  I was riveted, and not only by Guy Pearce's edgy yet charming hero.  All the performances were cohesive and a perfect complement to Pearce's obsessed Shelby. 10/10 and great arty-without-being-stiflingly-pretentious cinema (well worth the $7)"

","""May contain a spoiler""<br/><br/>Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) can't hold any new memory ever since his wife was rape and murdered before his own eyes and he is seeking revenge in order ""to get his life back"". The story is nothing new, however the way the story is told is so refreshing that the story doesn't matter any more. Instead of telling the story from a the start, the director Christopher Nolan decided to tell the story backwards and through the eyes of Leonard Shelby. In that way he manage to get our attention because we see the story as Shelby see it and as Shelby, we don't have a clue to what happened before and we have to watch the film close in order to get all the details, and yet by the end I was left with the feeling that I missed something and questioned my own memory and was doubting whether I understood the film and really saw everything.<br/><br/>So here is a film who deals with the subject of memory and truth and eventually make the audience doubt his own memory and what he perceive as the truth. The whole film is like a puzzle and the end doesn't give you the satisfaction of solving it.On the contrary. By the end you get another version to the events which seems as possible as what we saw before.<br/><br/>Technically speaking this is simply a superb film. If I understand correctly Nolan has shoot the movie the way it is been told(ie: backwards) which means that someone had to follow every detail so it will be accurate. I don't think I have seen any mistakes in the details. But technicality is not the only thing that stand out in this movie. The acting is brilliant. Guy Pearce shows that LA Confidential was not a one time achievement and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy is in good form and give the right balance to Pearce's character. I also liked the way San-Francisco is portrayed here,not as a big city with a lot of people but rather like a city in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to anyone who find himself bored from films which carry so much cliché and want to see something original. In this film they will find originality which at the same time keep us interested in what's going on.<br/><br/>Simply go and see."
"Venom-UK","10","0","1","11 November 2000"," Watch with friends, then go down the pub to discuss it
","How do I say how great this film is without giving away too much? Gladiator may be the best film out this year for sheer enjoyment, but this is the best film to watch with friends. There is so much to think about in this film that you need a few people to watch it with you so that you can all swap ideas afterwards.<br/><br/>Basically, Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man who suffered brain damage in an incident. This has left him with the inability to create new memories so everything he experiences will be forgotten within minutes unless he records it somehow. This ranges from photographs with hand-written notes on them through to tattoos on his body.<br/><br/>The style of the movie is very unusual. The story starts at the beginning and the end, and works its way to the middle from both sides. Now this may sound stupid, but trust me, it works. The first few minutes are confusing, but once you get the idea of what is happening, then you can settle back and enjoy.<br/><br/>The only film I can think of that compares to this is The Usual Suspects, but only in the way that you never know if you are being told the truth or not. This one will keep you guessing all the way through and still leave plenty to argue about with your friends.<br/><br/>I don't know about other countries, but this film appears to have got zero publicity in the UK. I knew nothing about it until a friend from work phoned me this afternoon asking if I wanted to see it. I'm glad he did as I hate to think I might have missed out on this absolute gem of a film.<br/><br/>You should definitely watch this film, but like I say in the subject line, go with some friends.

","The positives:  The way the film was cut, from end to beginning.  Definitely interesting watching this film in that manner.  Really liked the beginning of these scenes where Guy Pearce's character would ""wake up"", so to speak, and try to orient himself to the world around him.  Made me feel like I was in his shoes.  I liked the acting, for the most part.  Sort of low key, but believable.  Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Patiliano all play their parts well.  I liked the ending (or, in this film, the beginning).  It was really not what I expected.  Kind of spooky.  I liked pondering about the dilema Guy Pearce's character was in, but only for a little while, because it's really quite horrifying, I think.  <br/><br/>The negatives:  Sometimes I felt the way the film was cut, from end to beginning, got a little annoying, tiresome.  And something that really bothered me: whenever Guy Pearce's character would describe his condition to someone, he would always use the adjective ""you.""  Like, ""You wake up and you don't know where you are...""  To me, this was very disconcerting.  For a while I couldn't figure out who he was talking about, but then I realized it was himself.  ""I"" would have been a more powerful choice for these descriptions, I think.  ""I wake up and I don't know where I am..."""

Memento is a true gem. The segments are strung together seamlessly, with the right amount of overlap for you to understand what's going on. However, it doesn't lead you along by the hand, either.

"mermatt","Null","0","1","19 April 2001"," Human jig-saw puzzle
","The title of this film could be Socrates' motto, ""Know Thyself."" The main character suffers from a condition that allows him only the memories he had before a traumatic event in his life. Beyond that, he has practically no short-term memory and therefore must write notes to himself, take pictures, and mark his own body with clues.<br/><br/>But, as he is told several times in the film, he doesn't know who he really is. We are left with the questions of what the truth is, what memory is, and whether memory is merely interpretation of the truth. The film is thus a satire of the short-attention span of the modern world which makes us forget the past as well as the present.<br/><br/>To follow the story, the viewer must pay attention as the two main plotlines move toward each other from opposite directions and finally merge. The clues are deceiving and the only signals to the viewer of what is going on is the use of black & white film and color film to illustrate which plot segments are which.<br/><br/>Like the main character in the film, we too can never know anything for sure. We, like this wandering man, are caught in loops, replaying the past in the present and mistaking the present for the past. That is why we, like him, are such mixed up creatures as we try to assemble the strange pieces of our jig-saw puzzles without knowing what the finished pictures are supposed to look like.<br/><br/>The makings on the main character's body are clues, but not the clues that the viewer assumes they are. Without giving too much away, I will only say that the point is that you are the clue to yourself -- but the trick is to know who you are. Is that confusing enough? It's supposed to be because we are humans, and humans are confused beings.<br/><br/>We search for keys. We lie to ourselves. We remember only what we want to remember. We try to know who we are.

","Guy Pierce plays a character (Leonard) who's obsessed by a memory; unfortunately, that memory happens to be the last thing he remembers before suffering from a rare memory-loss condition.  In fact, this movie centers around the haunting, eerie way in which Pierce's character has woven that memory into the very fabric of his existence.<br/><br/>The masterpiece of Memento is the way in which the director literally ""sucks"" the viewer into Leonard's ""mind"". This movie truly succeeds at engulfing  the viewer into that swirling, whirling, twisting, dizzying world that constitutes Leonard's confused existence.  Moreover, the mental acrobatics demanded of us to follow this movie is what makes the ending (which is actually the beginning of the story) absolutely the most poignant climax I've experienced since ""Angel Heart"" (in which the detective played by Mickey Rourke discovers that he's been searching for himself -- or rather, the person he used to be -- all along)."

"spinin","10","0","1","19 April 2001"," I don't expect a sequel called ""Memen... two"" - my friend came up with that one!
","At the heart of ""Memento"" is the question: What can you do with your life when you have no short-term memory? You have no ability to create new memories and every few minutes you start off fresh, having absolutely no idea what just occurred. Anything important that happens in your life will be quickly forgotten and practically non-existent. How can you live the rest of your life with any meaning or motivation?<br/><br/>This is the challenge that Leonard, the hero of ""Memento,"" faces. He is played by Guy Pearce who starred in another small movie I recently discovered called ""Ravenous,"" an unbelievably surprising flick that cleverly combined several movie genres with new spins. He has picked another great role to play here. Leonard lost his short-term memory when he tried to defend his wife from an attacker that invaded their home. She was killed and he was left with a scar for life, determined to find the killer and get revenge. The two other main characters he is in contact with are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). Both played in ""The Matrix."" Teddy seems suspicious, but who knows? Natalie seems all right, but can you really trust anyone? The paranoia and confusion are evident. Leonard trusts only the facts he has discovered himself. In order to remember them, he takes Polaroids, writes brief notes, and tattoos the really important stuff all over his body. It's insane. However, he has the motivation to make this system work and that is his quest to find his wife's killer.<br/><br/>The plot is not as important as how the film is made and how it involves us. The very first shot of the movie, played in reverse as a photograph disappears, is strikingly appealing. ""Memento"" itself is told backwards, not in reverse, but rather scene followed by a scene that logically precedes it and explains what we saw a few minutes ago. At the same time, another story is being told in black and white in chronological order, giving us something else to keep track of. Telling the story in reverse is such a simple plot device, but it is the key. By doing that, we have short-term memory as well and we see everything from Leonard's point of view. We don't know where we start out and we try to make sense of everything around us. It's not exactly like we have short-term memory, but we're just as confused as the main character.<br/><br/>""Memento"" starts out at the end, and so we see the conclusion of everything that will eventually be revealed as the movie proceeds. How can this movie end in an interesting way then? Trust me it does. By telling it in reverse, the movie requires us to pay attention and makes each scene important and involving even though we get further away from the actual outcome. There are some great moments. At one point, Leonard snaps in and sees a bottle of some alcohol in his hand, but says that he doesn't feel drunk. What's going on then? Later (or earlier), he forgets what is going on in the middle of a foot-chase. He first thinks that he is chasing a guy, but when the guy turns around and starts shooting at him, he calmly corrects himself and starts running.<br/><br/>I've seen stories told backwards before in episodes of Seinfeld and the X-Files. Seinfeld was clever, but that's all that was to the story since it was not very funny. The X-Files episode was actually much better, but the only reason that was done was so that the character could go back and get a second chance to correct a wrong. Interesting, but corny. ""Memento"" is ingenious and dark; a film-noir told in reverse. My friends thanked me for dragging them out to see this movie. There's not much beyond the plot and the style and in a way, the style detracts from us becoming too emotionally involved with the characters and the story. We're too busy juggling everything else. I didn't like that, but that's the point. It's new, it's interesting, it's clever, and it's edited seamlessly for an exciting two hours. The bottom line is that Leonard knows his life is messed-up, but he's just trying to do something about it. An excellent movie. I give it a perfect 10."

","(some SPOILERS in this review). The major thing that makes this movie really interesting and exciting is the way it is presented, a reverse timeline.  Basically, the first scene in the movie (besides the black and white scenes) is the last scene if the movie were in chronological order, and the last scene would have been the first (after the black and white stuff).  It's a more extreme version of what Tarantino did for `Pulp Fiction', however that movie had a lot more going for it where this one doesn't If the movie had been shown with the correct timeline (and if they had moved the final twist scene to the end of the film, which would have been very easy to do) then I think the movie would have lost a lot of appeal.<br/><br/>First, it would have removed most of the questions in the movie.  Most of the mystery is about `what happened to that ?', or `when did that happen?'.  By showing the movie backward you see what happened to people and then you see how it happened.  This is one of the most interesting things in the film, which would have not been there if it had been shown in chronological order. Secondly, if the movie were shown with the correct timeline the plot holes in the movie would be much more apparent.  For example, Natalie supposedly first meets Leonard behind the bar.  The next time she meets him in the bar (right after she meets him behind the bar, but in the movie this scene is right before the other one) she quickly plays some pranks on him because of his mental condition (he has sort term memory loss Â– which she apparently has heard about before although I don't think she had met him before).  Then, a few minutes later (which is a few minutes earlier in the film) she invites a guy she basically just met to stay at her house for `a few days'.  If the movie were shown in chronological order this would have been somewhat confusing, just like it is if you think about it after you see all the scenes in the movie. I'm not saying that the movie has only one or two things going for it. It has some very good acting in it, some very interesting scenes which take advantage of Leonards unusual mental condition, but the best thing about it and the thing which makes the movie so mysterious, creative, and entertaining, is that fact that it's shown backwards."

","The memento has come for me to tell you that you will not see a more original film this year than  `Memento.' The film is about an insurance agent who is on a vengeance mission to find out who raped and killed his wife. However, this is definitely a challenge for him because he has short term memory loss from the time that his wife was murdered. This means he only remembers real life experiences right after they happen for only about 5 minutes (which is very similar to my situation when I go out drinking). He experienced this trauma because of a head injury he suffered when he was trying to save his wife from the killer. Star Guy Pearce delivers an unforgettable performance that academy award voters should not forget during oscar time. The remarkable thing about this film is that is presented backwards. We see the action-packed conclusion at the beginning of the film, and the beginning of the story at the end (which is very similar to how I always hope my dating nights would turn out to be like). Anyway, this makes us be in the same predicament as the main character because of his condition. Whatever you do, don't forget to see `Memento.' ***** Excellent"

When the DVD is out and I can watch the chapters in the ""correct"" order I'm sure that gaping holes will appear and the story won't seem half as curious.<br/><br/>
As we left the cinema and walked home we couldn't work the story out. Had we been given enough information after the apparently abrupt ending? Was Leonard's wife diabetic? Had he already avenged her death (having unwittingly killed her)? Had we really seen him, with tattoos, with her? Were the occasional flashes of memory (like remembering that the licence plate was fact six) down to his sometime failing or the scriptwriter's fallibility. <br/><br/>Or was that the point? That we spent time after the film trying to recreate the story proved the fallibility of our memories - a meta-level, interactive display of what we'd just seen. <br/><br/>Inventive, exhausting, provoking, gripping - a splendid film."

","Ok, I went and saw Memento last night and I liked it, but I didn't think it was great.  First the pros.... the story was awesome.  The whole ""not being able to form new memories"" thing makes for an intriguing film.  Also, the way the scenes are played in reverse chronological order works well. You're thrown into each scene not knowing what has happened just before.... just like Leonard is.  There are also some great characters in this film.  Joe Pantoliano's ""Teddy"" is excellent.<br/><br/>Now the cons.... I don't care for movies that leave questions unanswered, and this one leaves MANY questions unanswered.  Plus, it could've gone further back in time (when did he get the other tattoos? how did he get the other clues?, etc.) Also, late in the film, the reverse scene order gets a bit difficult to remember, but not too bad.  Another thing, Leonard seems too calm and at ease each time he loses his memory for someone who is basically waking up in a strange place with strange people.  Often times it seems as though he does remember the people and places and the investigation. But, maybe that's the whole deal.... maybe that's supposed to make you think. But, that brings me back to the unanswered question bit.  I want to know what's going on!<br/><br/>And one thing I kept thinking was, ""If Leonard can't remember anything after the incident, how does he know he has a condition?""<br/><br/>Oh well, I guess that's part of the intrigue of the film.

"LeJoe","Null","0","1","9 April 2001"," Confusion Reigns Supreme
","In director Christopher Nolan's Memento, cryptic filmmaking is taken to new heights as lead character Leonard Shelby (played by the talented and attractive Guy Pearce) grapples with a rare form of amnesia that causes almost instantaneous short-term memory loss on a continuous basis. The last thing he remembers is a brutal incident in which he suffered a head injury when his wife was raped and killed. Consequently, he thrives on taking revenge, desperately trying to find his assailant in a circuitous web of confusion and dead ends. Overall, critics seem to like this topsy-turvy exercise in reverse osmosis, so I expected to be impressed. One of the film's devices is the sequencing of its events, which seems to work backwards from the end to the beginning. We're not just talking about occasional flashbacks either. Instead, we're virtually watching a story in reverse...perhaps a novel, intriguing concept that made excellent fodder for shooting the breeze at Hollywood parties and brainstorming sessions, but which mostly produced confusion to the point of near exasperation when executed. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy play low-lifes with ulterior motives whom our memory-challenged character gets involved with, adding sordid characters to the overall pandemonium. But ultimately, the film comes off more than anything as an excuse for a cinematic gimmick, an exercise in pointlessness to the level that one really doesn't care about the disjointed plot or the characters any longer. I and others leaving the theater seemed glad it was over but were haunted by some mysteries of our own:  What was really happening in this movie? Should I even care? Why did I see this? Where did I park the car? Oh well, at least it was a bargain matinee. I might have gone on a vengeful rampage of my own had I paid full price."

"cho_johnny","7","0","1","6 April 2001"," Intriguing? Yes. Brilliant? Um...
","First of all, do yourself a favor and go see this film.  Not because it's necessarily the greatest film ever made, but it's certainly much more intelligent and original and interesting than, say, Gladiator or that silly jiggle-giggle flick with Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.  And then you can come back here and read everybody's comments and they will make more sense to you.<br/><br/>What follows is directed more at people who have already seen the film:<br/><br/>There is no question that Christopher Nolan is an exceptionally talented and intelligent filmmaker -- if nothing else, he sure is ambitious -- and we should all look forward to his next work.  But whether you think this is a great film or simply an impressive technical exercise depends, I think, on how you react to the ending.<br/><br/>A structure like this demands an ending that knocks your socks off, and if that ending isn't there...<br/><br/>Either the ending will convince you and you will feel as if Nolan had intended to take you there all along; or it will not convince you, and you'll feel as if he's throwing up philosophical smoke and mirrors to cover up what is a less-than-dazzling conclusion.  For me, it felt like the latter.  I didn't buy it.  It seemed like he started with the intriguing structure and the puzzle and then used some philosophical scotch tape to try to keep the whole thing together.<br/><br/>Yes, memory can be unreliable, but not quite to the extent that it is for Guy Pearce's character or anyone in real life who suffers from that kind of extreme mental condition.  Ultimately, Memento is not a film that makes you think about life; it's a film that makes you think about the film.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  In fact, it's an excellent lesson for screenwriters and filmmakers everywhere that you can move a story backwards chronologically and still keep it moving forward dramatically.<br/><br/>I applaud Nolan's ambition and much of his execution.  It's not one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but it's certainly one of the most interesting and impressive.  And given that Nolan is already starting to work with the likes of Al Pacino, it's not hard to believe that someday, he could end up making one of the greatest films I've ever seen.  Can't wait."
"maggie-9","Null","0","1","8 April 2001"," Still not sure what I think (major spoilers)
","I find that with most films I am pretty sure of my reaction on leaving or soon after.  This is the exception.  I still don't know what I think.<br/><br/>This is undoubtedly a cleverly-made and extremely well-acted piece, with Guy Pearce a standout.  It is based on an excellent idea, mostly well carried out.  So why am I not sure I have witnessed a great film?<br/><br/>For one thing I think the device of working back through the story became somewhat mechanical towards the middle.  I was rather tired and actually found myself nodding off a bit and having to force myself to concentrate.<br/><br/>Secondly, I discovered with the Usual Suspects that there is something quite unsatisfying about a movie in which nothing that has happened may have been real.  With Memento, what actually happens in the film is quite real; that is, Lenny is angry because of what Teddy tells him and he makes a conscious decision to record information about Teddy which will lead him (after he has forgotten the actual conversation) to hunt Teddy down and kill him believing that Teddy is his wife's killer.  The trouble is, we can't believe Teddy ourselves and therefore we know nothing at all at the end about Lenny, nothing about his wife, nothing about whether his memories of Sammy are real, just nothing.  I found this unsatisfying.  I don't demand that all ends get tied up but some resolution is needed.<br/><br/>I think ultimately I didn't actually believe in the validity of Lenny's condition as portrayed.  My feeling is that, if such a condition exists, it would be infinitely more disabling than shown, (more in fact like the portrayal of Sammy than of Lenny).  It might be argued that movies can set their own rules but this is a movie which invites us to think about it.  The trouble is, some movies begin to break up when you think about them too much, the inconsistencies appear and you lose the emotion you might have had when watching them.<br/><br/>Several comments have mentioned that the movie deserved more than an art house release.  Here in Australia, it is showing at my local multiplex, and has been quite extensively advertised.  But I think quite a lot of the audience will feel uncomfortable with it.  Not because they are too thick to understand it but because, ultimately, our possible concern for Lenny (generated mostly by Guy Pearce's performance) is dissipated by the self-conscious technique of the story.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure if, for me, this was a flawed masterpiece or a waste of time."

Personally, I was won over by the end of its fascinating (and ultimately symbolic) opening scene, but if you feel a little let down after your first viewing, do yourself a favor and watch it again.<br/><br/>After you've watched it at least twice, I recommend watching it a couple more times so you can catch the tiny visual clues that really solidify your understanding of the truth.  In particular, watch VERY closely during these two scenes: 1) Sammy Jankis sitting in his chair in the old folks home, 2) the final flashbacks that occur as Lenny is driving to the tattoo parlor at the end of the movie. You might also notice that some of Lenny's mannerisms and lines cleverly refer to his past habits.

I developed enormous sympathy for Leonard, a guy who is aware of his short term memory loss and has come to a point where he accepts it.  We are never sure of the other characters in the story, Leonard's notes and tattoos on his body gives us the basic clues as to who is to be trusted and significant data that are important to the script, like a former client of his who had the same condition of memory loss that Leonard has.  There is no easy resolution in this movie, if you like your movies all tied up neatly at the end this is not for you.  Rather, it lingers with you long after the movie is over, like an endless loop.

","You'll either love or hate Memento. It's that kind of movie. If you want a lot of fast action, special effects, and spoon-fed messages, pass on this one. You won't understand it, and it will probably bore you to tears. However, if you really enjoy puzzles and if you appreciate absolutely first-rate production values, acting, direction, and plot, then buy or rent this one as fast as you can. Also, bring a little intelligence. It helps.<br/><br/>Memento succeeds on many levels. It is among the greatest noir films ever made. It's got guns, cars, black humor, red herrings, and a femme fatale. It outshines Psycho in engaging the audience on a subliminal basis. Indeed, as a thriller, it ranks with Hitchcock's best. Best of all, it poses a number of profound BIG questions concerning the nature of man, his morality, and the basis for his civilizations and religions in such a subtle way that it almost seems an afterthought. Yes, this movie will really make you think. And it will make you want to talk to others about it.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the way the director, Christopher Nolan, structured the film in backward sequences to give the audience the same feelings of confusion and frustration as the protagonist, Leonard Shelby, who is played by Guy Pearce. Not so easily recognized is how the clues that Nolan gives his audience can be added up in many different ways to reach a `conclusion'. Virtually no two people will agree completely on just exactly what they saw or even what it means. This effect is extraordinary and can be compared to only a few films, such as Rashomon, where the characters give widely different interpretations of events. In Memento, we are able to construct our own reality from the facts that we are given. In truth, what seem to be facts can be interpreted to a high degree and are really decision points upon which we can diverge to build our own recollection of events and conclusions. Memento thus becomes an individually unique experience and, in a convincing way, supports Nolan's thesis that memories are not to be trusted. (After repeated viewings, it's still 10/10.)"

","...because otherwise you definitely will get a little confused watching this film for the first time. Not only is the main narration told backwards, it is also interspersed with black and white clips from a sequence which is told in correct chronological order and turns out to be the beginning of the main narration. Or its end, depending on how you wanna look at it. In short, two storylines are told simultaneously, one of them backwards, the other one not and in the end they are connected at the beginning of the one told backwards and the end of the other one. Pheew. This is what you are going to have to keep in mind if you are interested in understanding what the hell is going on, you are going to have to memorize the scenes and put them into the right order in your mind.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>
This structure alone would be sufficient to make ""Memento"" one of the most innovative and clever films of the last ten years. But Mr Nolan not only gives us an interesting puzzle (is he the killer? If not, who is the killer? Why did he kill him? And who the hell is this anyway?) that is solved in the last scene. He uses the structure to put the audience - without its knowledge - right into the head of a handicapped man who's whole mission is hopeless from the very beginning. But he does not know that, and neither does the viewer until the very last scene which makes the entire pointlessness of his actions painfully apparent: His entire life is a ballgame since ""the incident"". He is the ball. To all the people around him he is just a useful retard they can play with like a marionette. Yet he does not realize this, and Christopher Nolan's great merit is it to keep the viewer from knowing that until the very end.<br/><br/>That is why the ending comes as such a big twist. It is just on account of the outstandingly clever directing. I mean, it should be obvious the second you hear about it: a guy who can't remember a thing ten minutes after he has killed someone wants to investigate the murder of his wife, give me a break. Everyone else in the film knows this, and that is exactly why everyone is using him, including himself. And when the viewer finally gets to realize this, it is a definite jawdropper, as if oneself had been the retard the for last 100 minutes and is just waking up.<br/><br/>As for the other aspects for the film, the editing is very good and adds a lot to the atmosphere, as does a great score. Guy Pearce is even better than in LA Confidential. I liked the contrast of the color with the very beautiful black and white cinematography. Watch out for the moment when both storylines connect and color streams into the black and white picture!<br/><br/>Maybe one of the best, definitely an extremely clever movie worth watching three or more times.<br/><br/>Fact 1: You cannot believe those liars who were bored by this film.

Nor is it not a fantastic film, just because it requires you to use your brain.<br/><br/>Good points are, as mentioned, the script and Guy Pearce's acting. But I never really got ""in"" the film - it's very hard to identify with the main character - and the supporting roles weren't very in-depth.<br/><br/>Well worth watching - but not too often."

","This movie has one of the best scripts I have ever seen since the early nineties. It should have won the best screenplay academy award. There are no words to describe how great the plot is. Please note that some minor spoilers and a major one are included in this review. <br/><br/>The story is told backwards. This is because the interesting part is the conversation between the main characters in the beginning of the story and not the shooting that takes place in the end of it. <br/><br/>A man named ""Teddy"" is killed. Only in the end of the movie we find out how evil this person is and why he really deserved to die. Teddy deserved to die for reasons other than what the main character thinks throughout the entire movie. The main character played by Pearce has a false perception of reality based on notes, photos, and his limited ability to remember. On the other the reality is dark, sinister and twisted. <br/><br/>The brilliance in the movie is in the way the movie unfolds reality, i.e. what has really happened in the story and why. Events are explained backwards so that in the end we understand why the Pearce character had to execute Teddy .<br/><br/>One final comment. With this review I decided to reveal a major element of the plot so as to help the people who found this masterpiece boring understand its brilliance. The story can be interpreted in many different ways. So this is only my interpretation: Teddy in the story is evil, not because he killed the wife of the Pearce character, but because he was using the Pearce character to commit murders on his behalf. On the other hand, the Pearce character was living out of false clues that would eventually lead him to the ""real"" murderer of his wife. He was creating clues so as to have something interesting to think about after loosing his memory again and again and again..."

You may even get it half right.

Some may be tempted to find a way to watch the film backwards...resist this thought!!

There wasn't a dull moment.  Guy Pearce gives an excellent performace (that the Academy overlooked) as a man without a memory.

","The first time I saw this movie was when I previously borrowed it from a friend.  I really didn't have any interest in watching it besides the fact that Guy Pearce and Carrie Ann-Moss were in it.  Guy Pearce was excellent in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL as a rival detective to Russell Crowe and Carrie Ann-Moss struck my attention just because I think she looks good, haha.  The premise involves Leonard Shelby(Pearce), a man who has lost his short-term memory after a terrible incident.  If he has a conversation with somebody, he wont remember the conversation or the person he was talking to five minutes after.  Leonard has countless interactions with characters throughout the film and you never know what will pop up next.  If you liked MEMENTO, then you should see THE USUAL SUSPECTS with Kevin Spacey and Chazz Palminteri. MEMENTO will have an effect on you from start to finish and is one of Christopher Nolan's first movies.  I highly recommend this one."

","The confusing plot and thrilling scenes of actions are the characteristics of this great film starred by Guy Pearce and directed by Christopher Nolan. Everything is showed backwards on the movie, what makes it impossible to take the eyes off the screen during the whole film. End is actually in the first scene and the beginning is in the last one. It's an enchanting innovation that can't be missed at all. <br/><br/>Lenny (Guy Pearce) is a desperate man who wants to discover who killed his wife during his house robbery. Because of a blow he received in the head in the attack he has to use notes, pictures and tattoos on his own body to remember what he has just done and to know who people are. Many other characters enter the story what confuses Lenny who don't know if he can trust them or not. We who watch the movie also have to pay close attention to what is happening not to miss the important details that explain the plot.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce together with Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano, who play two of those mysterious characters Lenny must investigate about, have great performances in this unforgettable and highly recommended film.

If there is any kind of rule in a suspense/thriller/whatever, it is that we should get some kind of handle on what really happened. And I don't think we do.

"queitus","Null","0","1","16 April 2002"," Arty and Interesting but lacking in some areas
","It's all been said before so I won't bother with detailing how the movie plays out.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this movie, and I immediately could see why many people just get frustrated watching it. You need a LONG attention span for something like this, and it requires a constant use of short-term memory(interestingly enough)in order to understand what's going on. The more the 'backwards' scenes (colored part) play out, the more you have to keep in mind when discovering the precluding events. It becomes more difficult as the film progresses but eventually the 'past' (black and white part) fades into the 'present' and all is well in the 'conclusion' (or middle, depending on how you look at it) of the film.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't enjoy was the flatness of Natalie and Teddy. As characters, Teddy was a tad more interesting than Natalie, but neither really held my interest. It was more Leonard's perception of them that made one think; not the character itself. Then again the mere fact that Leonard only remembers them for a few minutes at a time really inhibits the possibility of him developing any sort of relationship with them.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film was very good and I believe deserving of the honors it received. You need to be looking for a psycho drama and have a very good attention span. I was in a particularly analytical mood when I saw it so that might help too :) Not for people looking for a fast-paced action thriller with good guys and bad guys clearly labeled :)"

Also notable about the movie is the unique backwards sequence of scenes, which keeps the audience guessing. Like Fight Club (also a great movie) before it, Memento's opening scene reveals the ending, but instead of reverting to the beginning of the story, Memento continues from the end. This is a refreshing and exciting style that we will probably be seeing a lot of in future movies.

"KFL","10","0","2","25 March 2002"," Superb examination of the role of memory
","Having seen this movie twice, I have come to appreciate that it is very carefully constructed, and has something important to say about both the importance of memory, and the dangers inherent in the kind of thumbnail encapsulations of others that Leonard is forced to rely upon.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow...please read no further if you haven't seen the movie.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert and others have complained that Leonard's very awareness of his own condition is a contradiction:  He should not be able to even remember that he has short-term memory loss. But Leonard is, in fact, able to gradually assimilate information over time--partly through repetition. He tells us this much himself, at one point. In fact, it is this conditioning that holds the key to understanding the central surprises of the movie. Leonard has ""conditioned"" himself to ""remember""--but this artificial ""memory"" is flawed:  he doesn't want to face the fact that he himself was responsible for his wife's death, for example, and so he misremembers the insulin episode as having happened to Sammy. (Leonard presumably would have been nonplussed had he been asked how he knew about Sammy's wife's death: Sammy certainly couldn't have told him.) We see this ""conditioning""--this propensity to remember, selectively, what he wants to remember--most forcefully (and perhaps a bit heavy-handedly) at the end, when he writes down Teddy's license plate number, effectively making him the next ""John G.""<br/><br/>Leonard's inability to remember implies an inability to forget what went before--and so highlights, by its absence, the healing power of time--which is, after all, only the memories intervening between the present and some past event. For Leonard, there are no such memories, hence time has, in a sense, stopped for him. He himself recognizes that he has no chance to heal.<br/><br/>Contrast this with the situation in the 1993 Harold Ramis Twilight Zonish-comedy ""Groundhog Day"". Here the situation is reversed:  Phil Connors is the only one with any recollection of a series of Groundhog Days. It is almost as if Phil lives in a world populated by Leonards. Just as others use Leonard for their own purposes, so Phil, with his unique ability to remember, is able to use and abuse others. More importantly, Phil is able to heal, able to remake himself into something new and better, precisely the way that Leonard cannot.<br/><br/>Despite a few minor snags in the storyline (and Leonard's awareness of his own condition is not one of them), this is a very well-crafted tale that repays repeated viewings and reflection.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Leonard (Guy Pearce) is an insurance investigator who's wife has been raped and murdered by someone. That someone also caused Leonard a strange head injury that does not allow his brain to make new memories past the incident. Leonard wants revenge on this man who's ruined his life, but he also has to get over the obstacle of his memory loss. So he takes pictures with his Polaroid camera and makes himself notes by Tattoo of who he knows, what he knows about them, who he can trust, who he can't, and what to do next. Along the way, he meets up with Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who help him.<br/><br/>The major twist through all of the movie is that Memento is shown in clips, like pieces of a puzzle and you, the viewer, figure out how the puzzle fits together. There are two different types of clips in the movie, one is in color and is the story of Leonard's thirst for revenge, while the other clips are a telephone conversation that is shown is black and white. This is one of those find-it-out-for-yourself flicks that I certainly do not want to ruin, but be patient with it. I rented the DVD and had to watch many, many parts over and over to understand what just happened. Grab a pen and some paper, because this is a great ride.<br/><br/>As for the acting, let me start with Guy Pearce, the star of the show. What a wonderful performance, excellent emotion and frustration runs rampant in this film and he does it so well. To be completely honest, I think he should have gotten at the very least an Academy Award nomination, but this is the Oscars we're talking about and, well don't get me started. Next is Carrie-Ann Moss, from The Matrix fame of playing Trinity, but she plays the bartender Natalie and befriends Leonard on his quest of avenging his wife's murder. She also is very good with the frustration of the whole matter. Teddy is probably the most over looked character performance, he's played by Joe Pantoliano, who, incidentally has also played in The Matrix as Cypher. Joe does a great job of being annoying in this film, just like he was good at being the guy-you-love-to-hate in The Matrix (is that a good thing?). And how about Mark Boone Junior? I like him, there are a couple of scenes where he just loosens up the tension and emotion that drives the film, and they're just refreshing scenes to watch.<br/><br/>Memento is a very well done movie, but in the content area it doesn't fare so well. Memento has over 75 uses of the ""f"" word and 23 ""s"" words. The movie is saturated with them and the only way to get over them is to tune them out. Other words are used too, including the Lord's name in vain a few times. So, if you're sensitive to harsh language this is a movie you might want to pass on. That's not all, when Leonard is making notes from tattoos we see it. He takes out the center of a pen and injects himself with it, and it's not a pretty sight. The main reason this movie got an 'R' rating is from the language. The violence is really PG-13 type stuff.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great great movie and I really do recommend you see it, especially if you like to be the sleuth on the case in trying to piece this whole mess together. 9 out of 10"

","This was probably one of the best suspense thrillers that I have ever seen. I found it very creative because I have never seen a movie that started at the very end and revealed the past more and more throughout the movie.  I first thought it was confusing because I didn't really get what was happening until the very end.  But even when I saw the end I still wasn't sure of what really happened!  I think this was the point of the movie. The story was about a man dealing with denial because his wife was brutally raped.  He catches the two rapists in the act and he kills one of them. But the other one escapes.  This is where I think the self denial comes in because the man will never find his wife's other rapist and doesn't really want to believe that.  The man also developes short term memory loss due to the accident, meaning that he can't make any new memories.  This is a very big problem because other people see his weakness and use it to make him do things for them.  He believes that if he writes himself notes that he can rely on them, but he really can't.  I think that the movie leaves the viewer with a mystery for him/her to make a conclusion from.  But I don't think that there is a real conclusion and that many people might be to quick to come up with one just to comfort themselves or make them feel more secure. I think that the movie is trying to teach people the power of denial and that some things in life will always remain a mystery and can never be figured out.  I think people are so afraid of this that they use denial to make themselves feel better.  This is not bad and very natural.

","I would like to begin by answering common problems some had with this.<br/><br/>""How can he remember his wife dying if he has this condition?""<br/><br/>On several occasions we are reminded that the last thing Leonard remembers is the struggle in the bathroom, getting his head slammed against a mirror, and lying sideways on the floor facing his brutalized wife.<br/><br/>
""How can he remember that he has this condition?""<br/><br/>That's a good question, and you could go two ways: suspend disbelief or assume that he had a note or tattoo somewhere reminding him of his short-term memory loss. Or maybe it was acquired through instinct, as told in the story of the accounting executive Sammy Jenkins. Make something up.<br/><br/> This is a picture that you will have to see many times despite what is revealed at the end of the film (or the opening of the story which is at the end, as this is all told backwards.) It's not how it first appears - the actions of all the characters, however brief they may be, all play an important role in what goes on.<br/><br/>I'm not going to give anything away. See it for yourself.<br/><br/>Deserved way more Oscar noms - for the directing, acting, and best picture for such slick production on a tight budget."

","****WARNING! There Are SPOILERS** In This Review***<br/><br/>
I watched <Memento> tonight and feel it it is safe to say that for a film I liked overall, it had to be the longest 113 minutes I've ever had to sit through. Usually you like a movie, you want it to be longer, or the movie sucks and it'll never end. With this I was intrigued at first (because who wouldn't be by a lead character with complete short-term memory loss?), but slowly and surely I began to feel like the dude from <Clockwork Orange>; *TORTURED.* Not because I wanted the film to end or that it was boring; on the contrary, I was glued to the screen for every little thing. I wasn't comfortable with being potentially disappointed by a bad ending, being manipulated by the gimmick of backwards storytelling, but worst of all, the dramatic irony involved with the lead.<br/><br/>  Irony...well yeah.. Because the character seems more ""with it"" and seems more determined to ""figure things out"" at the end of the film, you realize this is only the beginning, and then figure out that he *was* able to retain a bit of his memory at this time, but the more he told himself -and people-about his ""condition"", the more confusing it got. The depressing part is you vaguely remember what happened in the beginning by the film's end, but remember enough to know that the main character will be doomed with this forever. <br/><br/>
   One of the characters-was it Natalie?- asks him why he wants revenge if he won't remember having done anything 15 minutes later. His answer pretty much sums up why he ripped the photo of a murdered Dennis and why he always mentioned Sammy's name and story: The truth hurts. Ignorance may not be bliss in Lenny's world, but if the only 15 minutes he ever remembers is that he is the hero out looking for his wife's 'murderer', he won't remember what actually happened: that he felt so guilty for the rape happening that he went nuts and faked the STML thing and so was responsible for his wife's insulin overdose.<br/><br/>  Disturbing, depressing, stylishly narrated, and very thought-provoking. I should see it again, but I may not want to;)"

","Every time I praised a movie this year, someone would tell me ""but you haven't seen 'Memento'"". Well, now I've seen it. Firstly, I note this site, (but not the box), identifies this as a ""2000"" film. This would explain why it was snubbed for the 2001 Oscars. Beyond that, It is not the best film I've seen from 2001, (""In the Bedroom"" is). It's certainly an interesting film, (and I don't mean that to be the left handed compliment it normally is), as the hero has a most interesting problem. He has to find the killer of his wife despite his loss of short term memory, which he combats by making notes, taking pictures and even tattooing things he doesn't want to forget onto his body. It would be a great premise for a TV show. But it makes for an emotionally antiseptic movie, hardly comparable to ""A Beautiful Mind', ""Monster's Ball"" or ""In the Bedroom"", films that were much more emotionally involving. The hero of this doesn't know what's happened and so his personality lacks depth. And he turns out not to have been much of a hero anyway. I like a movie I'm still thinking about days later. I've forgotten this one already."

","Each time I watch this movie I like it better than I did the last time. for me, it's a really deep viewing experience. I ran across a great analysis of Memento (that I really needed) by Andy Klein entitled ""Everything you always wanted to know about Memento"" (on salon.com). If you're reading this Andy, ""Thanks"" for your much needed help. I looked for something like this because, after watching Memento a few times, I really wasn't sure what I had just seen. I think this is THE best movie from 2000 - really, extremely, wonderfully thought-provoking. And oh, BTW, I also liked the ""Backwards Seinfeld"" episode."

","A few words of warning - don't watch this movie if you just want to relax and unwind or if you're tired! I sat down to watch this, curious about it after seeing its high rating on the IMDB and noting that Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne Moss were in it. I just wanted to unwind on a Saturday night and ended up concerntrating for the entire duration of the movie. A movie that gets you thinking is great, I love that, but this one requires you to think non-stop, which is exhausting! I came away feeling very tired and very confused. After a discussion with my boyfriend we figured out what it had all meant eventually but we didn't feel entertained.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce is brilliant, I'm hoping to see him in excellent roles such as this in the future and Carrie Anne Moss plays an interesting part very well. The way the movie was put together eg. the scenes in reverse order was interesting, although I feel as if I'd have to see it again, preferrably from the end to the beginning, to see how it all fits together properly.<br/><br/>
Overall, the movie is well filmed, acted and written and definately worth seeing. There are a lot of confusing elements, parts of the movie that still don't make sense to me, and I think that there should have been some explanation either throughout or at the end of the movie. I don't know about it's ranking here on the best movies of all time, although it's better than most movies these days, I wouldn't have included it myself, but I tend to like movies to be a little more entertaining than this. It's worth it just to see Guy Pearce at work (especially if you're Australian - remember him when he was younger?). He's grown so much as an actor. I think the book would be worth a read, if there is one out there, at least you could take a break between chapters and go back and read them again.<br/><br/>Worth it, but be prepared for a long 113 minutes!"

","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, 3rd favorite of all time (right after The Usual Suspects and American Beauty). All 3 of those movies are as close to perfect as I think you can get.  Although, I only recommended Memento if you are renting the movie to sit down and really WATCH it, dont just view it.  I sat in a chair, right in front of the TV, with my DVD remote in hand, and intently watched the movie, and I still had to pause and rewind to make sure I got all the neccesary info from the last scene to keep the movie rolling.  It helps to have someone who's seen it before there with you(i'm sure they wont mind one bit) to point out the really important things and explain.  Once you've seen it once, watch it again.  And again.  And you still wounldnt have gotten everything the movie has to offer. Many movies are like jigsaw puzzles, but this is like a jigsaw that you have to put together starting from the middle, upside down and backwards, and you only have tiny bits of a faded and torn reference picture.  And the puzzle is of M.C. Escher's most mind bending work.  A true masterpiece.  Its impossible to describe the feeling you get when the credits start to roll. I suppose the best way to describe it is you are givin tiny metal pieces one at a time, and you have to put it all together, and when you finally do it and find its a gun, it shoots you in the ass. Remarkable movie."

","On leaving the theater, I was wishing that I did have short-term memory loss.  What I did have instead was a headache.<br/><br/>While it might seem that the movie is artistically cut with random sequences of plot cleverly interwoven, in fact the structure is quite formalized. Starting end to beginning, we see overlapping sequences of equal time slices of the story.  It's a gimmick and little more.  It is designed to keep the audience off balance and trying to figure out the story until the end.<br/><br/>However, even after you sort them all out, the pieces don't really fit. There are a number of events in the movie that appear to be totally unmotivated.  They don't seem to fit in with the main story or with any of the side stories either.  There are a couple of mcguffins that are never really dealt with.  <br/><br/>While it's fun to contemplate the nature of memory and reality, the fact remains that this is a mystery story which is every bit as much a mystery at the end as it was at the beginning."

","I write this commentary in March 2002, long after the nominations for the Academy Awards for this year have been announced.  My biggest feeling of disappointment was in the exclusion of Memento from just about every category save for writing and editing.  I have read reviews of the nominations, and most of them said that Memento was excluded for being ""gimmicky"".  The argument, they say, is that since the storyline runs backwards from the end to the beginning, it limits the creativity possible. Hogwash!  So what if it's a gimmick. Why not reward them if the gimmick works? It does, here, to perfection.<br/><br/>The backwards-running storyline produces many moments of ""aaaah, so THAT's how that happened!"", feeding important pieces of the plot to the viewer in a patchwork style that keeps the viewer involved.  This is not a movie for the easily distracted, as most ""gimmicky"" films are; this is one movie best viewed on DVD or VHS simply because there are many scenes so dense that you want to rewind them and watch them again. As the hero, Guy Pearce's performance fuels the entire story, expressing a full range of emotions and often juxtaposing opposite feelings from one scene to the next.  The writing, directing, and editing are top-notch, intelligent, clever, humorous, and, when needed, brutal.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano deliver excellent supporting performances, although this is becoming mere habit for Pantoliano.<br/><br/>Memento didn't find a mass audience because it is too intelligent for the average movie-goer.  But if you don't object to actually investing a bit of yourself in the process of watching a movie, see Memento.  It is far and away the best movie of 2001, and may be the best new movie I've seen in five years."
"diakonia_alpha","10","0","1","4 March 2002"," Unquestionably, the Best Film of 2001
","It's unfortunate that MEMENTO is not receiving the attention of the Academy, or other awards for that matter. In twenty or so years, I believe this movie will finally be given its due rewards. The innovation of the storytelling and the directing of this movie will reshape the art of cinema as we know it. Some movies have employed non-linear structures to tell their stories. Although MEMENTO does indeed have a linear structure (merely inverted), the unique storytelling has never been so integral to the characters and plot of the movie as this one.<br/><br/>Even though 2001 ended on a particularly strong note for movies, none surpassed this one in creativity and ambition. While the simpler movies collect all the awards this winter, MEMENTO will be the movie with the most impact upon the medium of filmmaking. I think that that speaks for itself.<br/><br/>
As far as the movie itself, even if it was played forward, it would be compelling. The fact that it doesn't stick to convention makes it riveting. Guy Pearce proves that he is a great actor, even though he doesn't appear to want stardom. Good for him. Good for us."

","This was ALMOST one of my favorite movies.  I was captivated from the very beginning with the clever filming technique, the clear, yet confusing plot line, the interesting story...  Memento lived up to everything I had heard and expected.  Right until the end. NOTE:  do not read any further if you wish to remain in suspense until the end of the movie.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
The movie created an excellent mood of suspense and curiosity as the plot points slowly fell together and everything began to make sense.  The girl, the drug dealer, the murder...  it all started to come clear, and, as I had suspected from the beginning, there would be a surprise ending, though, given the terms of the actual movie, it was hardly a ""surprise"".  The final confrontation brought Teddy and our ""hero"" together...  and then, there was no hero.  There is no one to root for here.  There is no tragic savior, there is no revelation, at least one worth being excited about.  The cop is as crooked as could be assumed, the drug dealer was a drug dealer, and our ""hero"" turns out to be nearly the worst of all.  It is a huge let-down for me to discover that there is no justice in the world of forgetfulness of Leonard, our tragic man who is used by everyone, including himself.  It's hard to even feel sorry for him anymore.  It all falls apart. Of course, that is my only qualm with the movie.  It was highly deserving of the eight it received for the ingenious cutting, dialogue and inner monologue of Lenny, and the most unusual plot.  This indeed is a great movie, but for me, it was just not quite enough.  Perhaps next time, I won't watch the end."

","This film seems to operate on three levels. The first level is the reverse order set of scenes used to present the story. The second level is the understanding which comes near the end (beginning?) of the film when all the missing facts are provided in one scene. I thought I detected a third level, but was not sure that was intended until the closing scene, when such intent was made clear by the lines: ""I have to believe in a world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning... even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there."" I think there are a couple of other underlying themes. If you like movies which make you think, you will probably like this one."
