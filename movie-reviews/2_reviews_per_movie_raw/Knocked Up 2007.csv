"RabidED990","8","250","368","22 October 2007"," Vulgar, Sure, But Certainly Not Stupid.
","I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like ""Mr. Woodcock"" and ""Good Luck Chuck,"" movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.<br/><br/>""Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!"" <br/><br/>""He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!"" <br/><br/>No. Die.<br/><br/>Knocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with. Needless to say, he's the reason the movie works."

","Although the subject matter wasn't really appealing to me, the critics and general audience reviews are right: this is a very well made movie. The acting is great, the plot fast-paced, the characters believable and the dialog witty and clever. It reminds me of Superbad - another movie that I would never normally see, but one which wins you over by it's sheer (albeit crude) brilliance.<br/><br/>The basic premise is simple: a young TV reporter celebrates a promotion by getting drunk and inadvertently pregnant. The father-to-be is a good natured, pot-head slacker who has no money. When she decides to have the baby, she's not sure what her relationship with the father should be... and the movie progresses from there.<br/><br/>It's a simple plot but the dialog is what makes this movie shine. No matter the scene, it was always fun to hear what the characters were going to say. Even though most of them were one-dimensional, the dialog made them seem human and easy to relate to. A fast-movie plot also kept the movie moving along - something was always happening and there was never a dull moment.<br/><br/>While there is a certain level of crudity throughout, the movie is generally lighthearted and innocent. It's a fun movie to see."
"se7en187","9","239","391","15 April 2007"," A simple story is made into a very entertaining comedy
","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) meets Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) at a bar, they get drunk and have a little fun afterward, then they part ways. That is, until a few weeks later, Alison discovers she's pregnant and Ben is the father. This simple story makes up the hilarious film Knocked Up. I really enjoyed this, it has a lot of great laughs and it also has a lot of heart spread throughout.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen does an excellent job, I'm glad he's been given the chance to be the lead in such a big film. And Katherine Heigl is equally entertaining. The two of them are so great together, they're just so much fun to watch on screen. The supporting actors are also wonderful. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are perfect together. And I think Kristen Wiig steals the show with her small yet hysterical role as one of the workers at E!.<br/><br/>When people go to see this they'll want to compare it with 40 Year Old Virgin. Though I'm not a big fan of comparing movies to other movies, I guess I'll have to go through with it. For me, 40 Year Old Virgin is a funnier movie, but Knocked Up is a better written film and it has more heart to it. Both films based their story on a simple premise (a nerdy 40 year old hasn't had sex, a guy has a one night stand and gets the woman pregnant), but it seems like 40 Year Old Virgin used its idea to just get laughs. Knocked Up, on the other hand, uses its set up and continues the story throughout the film, developing its characters.<br/><br/>So, Knocked Up is a very enjoyable film, it has some big laughs (I particularly love the side story with the bearded roommate) but its also very sweet at times. I'm sure people will love it. See the movie and you'll get more than just laughs."
"B_D","6","315","542","12 June 2007"," Decent, but I don't see what all of the fuss is about.
","I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, not having seen the trailer, and two hours later I felt I had seen a decent movie, quite funny at times, but I couldn't figure out what everyone was making such a big deal about. Compared to a lot of what passes for comedy in the cinema these days, Knocked Up is great, but it's hardly the ""instant classic"" that I've seen it called in many professional and IMDb reviews. It's certainly worth seeing, but maybe at a discount matinée instead of a full-price evening show.<br/><br/>Much of what is wrong with Knocked Up is simply an over-reliance on Seth Rogen to deliver the laughs. To be sure, Rogen is a funny guy - he handled the jump from second-tier supporting actor (a la 40 Year Old Virgin) to leading man surprisingly well, appearing confident and charismatic. The problem is that as the film goes on, he just doesn't get a whole lot to work with from his supporting cast. Rogen doesn't have enough in him at this point to carry an entire film on his shoulders, but often he is forced into that role, providing the only humor in many scenes (especially in the second half of the movie). At times it almost seems as if Rogen has landed in the wrong film, delivering clever quips and laughs while the barely-likable characters around him remain too serious. Paul Rudd manages to break this up, taking some of the burden off Rogen, but Katherine Heigl and Leslie Mann's unfunny and quasi-sympathetic characters drag them down.<br/><br/>To be sure, the first half of Knocked Up is great, but by the second half the script becomes mired in slow, cliché drama. Marital dissatisfaction and the loss of youth are interesting themes to explore, but in doing so, Knocked Up fails to establish a consistent tone. As the film trudges past the 90-minute mark, it is sometimes humorous, sometimes dour, often clichéd, all resulting in an awkward mix of styles.<br/><br/>Overall, Knocked Up was a good effort, but a little more editing of the script would have helped a lot. I don't mind long movies at all, but 20 minutes could have been trimmed from this film to good effect."
"hellokristen","8","181","312","23 March 2007"," Surprisingly Funny
","From the title I expected an idiot-teen comedy, but it was quite a grown-up comedy. I envision teen boys liking the first 10 minutes (a chubby slacker gets to nail a hot chick after meeting her in a bar), then fleeing when the movie gets into REAL ""adult themes"". Uh-oh. She's pregnant. Now what happens? <br/><br/>This movie kept the audience laughing throughout. Most comedies tend to fall apart part-way through, but this one kept the laughs going. It constantly surprises and never settles for the clichéd joke.<br/><br/>There's more sex and nudity in this movie than you usually see in comedies, but it just makes the comedy more real. It's real -- so it's real funny. We've all found ourselves in awkward, yet hilarious, sexual situations like this. (Well, if you're lucky!) <br/><br/>All the actors are comedy experts -- many of them from Judd Apatow's other ventures: ""Undeclared"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"". Steve Carell, star of Judd's ""40 Year Old Virgin"" has a cameo. As does Ryan Seacrest who plays himself as a total asshole. (Makes you wonder why he agreed to do this.) Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader from SNL are great in their small roles.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan at first glance seems an unlikely leading man. But as the movie goes on, you grow to like him more. We see what the girl comes to see in him: he's funny and supportive and has a loving heart.<br/><br/>She's a 10 and he's a 5, so at first you don't think they could make it as a couple, but looks can be deceiving.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan at Cirque d'Soleil in an altered state is a hilarious scene. (That's how Cirque makes me feel when I see it anyway! Like a bad trip.)"
"Phenom67","5","80","134","17 June 2007"," Decent comedy at best
","It's amazing to me how average low brow comedies like this show up in the top 250 ahead of real deserving movies such as ""The Odd Couple"", ""Plains, Trains, and Automobiles"", and ""The Naked Gun"", but I would guess thats because a lot of the teenage and college movie goers rate this one high . Anyway, I went to see this the other night and got a few laughs and a chuckle or two every once in a while. But it was hard for me to get past the notion that this beautiful, successful, career woman would want anything to do with a dopey, unemployed, bonghead who doesn't shave once in the entire movie. Just the fact that he tossed his condom away right before the moment and didn't tell her and she only gets a little upset and still wants to be with this guy? Ridiculous! Anyways if you want a few sophomoric laughs and decent acting, this is OK."
"mummy99","5","80","134","3 June 2007"," Did not live up to the previews
","My 17 year old daughter and I had been looking forward to the release of this movie for quite some time and we went on opening day. Both of us like Katherine Hiegl and we were looking forward to a witty, funny film. Instead, we both thought that there was a negative edge to all of the humor that relentlessly followed the cast of characters from scene to scene. The main male and his friends were all unkempt slackers and it was hard to find something to like about them. The drug use was annoying and excessive - are there adults out there who really behave like this? Every negative stereotype about pregnant women and women not accepting their aging gracefully had to be dragged into the plot. The one nice male seemed to love his spouse but was unable to communicate his interests or feelings toward her and seemed like such a wimp. Even the two studio executives were tired stereotypes that denigrate women. Did the characters really have to be so cynical and negative? With the exception of the two sisters, it didn't seem like any of the characters really liked each other or really wanted to be around the others. I think the excessive drug use and nasty attitude toward sex was annoying. It is interesting to see that both males and females under 45 are rating this film very closely and much higher than both males and females over 45. It's certainly not a movie that we will see again."

","What would you do if you became pregnant by an oversexed bong-snorting gross pig of a human being after one drunken night of bar-hopping debauchery? Such is the question proposed in Judd Apatow's Knocked Up (2007) a mindlessly indoctrinating and strained, weak-premised regurgitation of that 'what if' and 'day after' scenario. The film is populated by thoughtless/clueless individuals who wouldn't be able to discover their own navels with two hands and a compass. This is a movie as primary and obvious in its effects as any clap-trap about twenty-somethings who should never become parents.<br/><br/>Apatow's screenplay bombards the audience with an endless line up of 'go for the crotch' jokes with the inevitable and largely predictable 'happy ending' tacked on for good measure. The script is not only simplistic in its one theme premise, but ultimately as much in bad taste as it left a bad taste with this critic. One vagina joke can be funny. Two is 'oh, please' and move the humor above the equator. After all, we're not all five years old and just discovered what our hoo-hoos and pee shooters can be used for.<br/><br/>However, after the tenth or eleventh kick in the nuts, Apatow's pedestrian screenplay simply degenerates into an anemic backdrop used to insert the word 'fuck' into every second or third line of otherwise boring dialogue and genuinely 'bad' writing. Advice to future script writers: if you can't make an audience laugh without employing obscenities then your lines are not funny to begin with and Knocked Up is about as unfunny as movies can get.<br/><br/>The story opens with attractive Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a reporter for E!, throwing caution  and the good sense God gave a lemon  into the wind when she decides to hook up with horn-dog off his leash, Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) inside a popular L.A. night spot. Aside: there's a reason why managers of nightclubs universally ascribe a design strategy of loud music and dim strobe lighting to their establishments: both  in conjunction with liquored libations dull and numb the senses. As the audience, we witness by how much Alison gets dulled down when the plot moves from a rather censored sex romp between she and Ben to an overly long close-up on Ben's exposed bottom the morning after.<br/><br/>From here, the plot is utterly pointless and predictable  especially given the film's obvious title. Alison discovers she's pregnant, decides to tell Ben, have the baby and hope for the best. Of course, nothing proves quite as easy as the first night's indiscretion. Ben, a druggy dropout with no future and no hope of one, isn't father material. He's just a sperm donor with a potty-mouth and devil-may-care attitude about everything.<br/><br/>Yet the film cannot even be honest about his character. Anyone smoking as much pot as Ben does would hardly be able to rattle off his own name, much less provide the uninterrupted angry litany of 'crotch' humor that philosophizes procreation into pornographic terminology - as raw, unfunny and unappealing as his own butt crack.<br/><br/>Obscenity in general is not a spruce up or supplement to quality writing. Clearly, Apatow's screenplay has no other purpose than to shock and repulse its audience with angry gross out humor, and such a shame too, since in the final analysis Knocked Up does not even fulfill that basic function - having overplayed its hand in the first five minutes. Lest we forget, that funny and crude do not go hand in glove - and implied comments are always more memorable than obvious ones.<br/><br/>Therefore, Knocked Up gets an 'F' in this critic's not so humble opinion - a lettered signifier that does not stand for 'fantastic' or that other aforementioned 'F-word' popularized to death in the script. Herein, the 'F' stands for 'flat.' This movie is a Frisbee. Toss it with the trash because that's exactly where it belongs! After seeing it once I hope never to see it again. I am trying to forget it now."

","I was uncomfortable through out this film, having to watch stereotype after stereotype, mean-spirited ""jokes"" and juvenile toilet humour. Let's look at the good:<br/><br/>Leslie Mann: Her shallow, annoying character was played very well by Ms. Mann; and by the end, she was even somewhat sympathetic. Harold Ramis: His two-minute scene was the ONLY truly likable character in this entire film. I loved him. Paul Rudd: Despite his woe-begone fatalistically brow-beaten character, Rudd was genuinely good. Too bad his character was ""resigned"" to what looked like a life not worth living.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>The jab at a guy like Stephen Hawking. Yeah; this film sinks that low. The stereotype that ""pot-heads"" are all unemployed, long-haired dopes with prurient life goals; think again... Heigl with Rogen's character? No way. This is a guy who grabbed his BONG during an earthquake without a thought to her safety. I could relate to her exasperation with Ben and his friends...but ending up with him? Sure....<br/><br/>The conversations about Munich were very insensitive; but then, this entire film was, so at least it was consistent. Endorsing De Beers?? The toilet humour..really. The reference to a woman's anatomy using the C-word, more than once, is misogynistic and really dumb. The kids, played by Apatows daughters, were cute; but I felt like they were being exploited. ""I googled murder"" today? Lovely. That list with the Canadian Beavers, headed by Pamela Anderson, Lolita Davidovich, Natasha Henstridge, and another woman, wasn't funny for me.<br/><br/>Even the second bar scene, where Mann and Heigl, who had previously pushed their way to the front of the line without a thought to ""the ugly people"" waiting in line, didn't play out as sympathetic at all. We are suppose to laugh at a situation where, they are now barred from line-jumping because Heigl is pregnant and Mann is ""too old""? And the 5% quota for certain races? I felt sick.<br/><br/>This film wasn't completely unfunny. Some of the scenes with the Hollywood execs. played quite well by Kristin Wiig and Alan Tudyk, were humorous. ""This is Hollywood. We don't like liars here..."".<br/><br/>Even the title of this film is offensive to me. I went because I loved The 40-yr Old Virgin, and because it was reviewing very very well across the board. Instead, what I saw was a crass piece of work that has been done many times before, by a director who is capable of much much better. If I were ever trapped with these characters, I would smile feebly and back out of the room asap.<br/><br/>What scares me is how popular this film is. What does that say about us? Maybe, this film isn't that influential in the long run. But it definitely reflects the taste rampant in the throngs of people lining up to see this horrible film, for a SECOND time, and declaring it the funniest ""comedy"" they've ever seen.<br/><br/>I don't think so."

","I can count on one hand the number of movies that I could not watch all the way through. This is one of them. The vulgarity of the main character and all of his buddies was so over the top as to be totally unbelievable; beyond even the realm of fantasy. I think I can tolerate a fair bit of this sort of stuff, but the movie exceeded my threshold. The only way the writers could have made this gang of misfits any less appealing would have been to make them criminals. I stopped watching soon after the lead female character decided to keep the baby; a decision that was totally unrealistic given her new career as a television interviewer. The idea that a woman like her would have anything to do with a guy like that was simply ludicrous. I thought this was going to be a good comedy, but excessive vulgarity isn't funny, it's just vulgar."

","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Freaks and Geeks"" lives on through multiple tie-ins - not the least of which is writer/director and producer Judd Apatow (best known for his smash hit ""40 Year Old Virgin""). This is a sharp comedy and cutting insight thanks to a terrific script, excellent comedic timing from Seth Rogen and Apatow's feel for a scene.<br/><br/>Rogen plays Ben Stone, a slacker who spends all his time smoking pot with his friends and conceptualizing an ""informational"" web site. One evening, while hanging with his buds in a club, he stumbles onto a ridiculously beautiful and ripe for the taking Katherine Heigl (Izzie from Grey's Anatomy). One thing leads to another and the next thing we know Heigl's character, Alison, is knocked up.<br/><br/>It would be easy to classify this as a slapstick comedy in the mode of ""Wedding Crashers"", but in fact, Apatow's script offers up some insightful commentary on marriage, family and relationships of all types. Apatow's real life wife, Leslie Mann, plays Heigl's sister who dreams of the perfect marriage, but is crushed when she discovers her husband's secret (not what you think). Mann's ""cheating"" husband is played brilliantly by Paul Rudd ... who flashes a very nice DeNiro impersonation.<br/><br/>The only weaknesses of the film are the shortage of scenes between Heigl and Rogen, and the fact that the film probably lasts 15 minutes too long. The whole Las Vegas sequence could have been cut. Still, this is not your typical comedy and please be prepared for some harsh (and loud) language and some very graphic visuals ... it is rated R for more than one reason! Apatow is creating his own look and feel and shows flashes of brilliant comedy writing. He could challenge the Cohen Brothers in the near future for the throne of off-beat comedy. Don't miss the fine songs from Loudon Wainwright III - especially the one playing over the closing credits."
"freedomFrog","Null","27","43","16 July 2007"," Beauty and the beast, Judd Apatow's style
","In director Judd Apatow's follow-up to his 2005 sleeper hit ""The 40-year old virgin"", Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a young and sexy TV presenter find herself pregnant after a one night-stand with Ben Stone, a twenty-something overweight unemployed pothead and looser living without any revenue with his stone-slackers roommates. Despite their differences, they try to make the best of the situation.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock once describe a kind of movie which are pleasant to watch and leave you satisfied when you go out from the theater but then, at midnight, when you open your fridge for a snack and think a little bit more about it, you realize it didn't really make sense and was nowhere as good as you thought it was. ""Knocked up"" is this kind of movie.<br/><br/>It is entertaining, funny and well played but, on a second thought not very good. Part of the problem comes from the fact that Alison and Ben don't belong to the same movie. Alison and her family remain believable characters even though some aspects of their life and personalities are exaggerated for comedic purpose. On the other hand, Ben's entourage looks like castaways from ""Napoleon dynamite"" or some other over-the-top comedy and are totally unrealistic. This is particularly problematic for the character of Ben who interacts with both groups: hence, he sometimes appears as an outrageous caricature (as when he doesn't realize that it might not be very wise on a first date with a woman way out of your league to mention that you and your pothead friends are currently working on building a porn website. But since the porn website is how Alison later finds back Ben's trail, I suppose we can simply attribute that to lazy screen writing), other times as a more mature and reality-grounded character.<br/><br/>Another problem is that Apatow seems to run out of ideas midway through the movie. Once Alison and Ben decide to keep the baby, they start dating and things go well. But ultimately, Alison breaks up with Ben. At this point, the movie just run into free wheels, Apatow wasting his time with comedic fillers bringing nothing to the plot so that, when it's time to come back to the plot, what should have been major development in the story are rushed out: when Ben finally graduates from retarded teenager to responsible adult, it is through a montage and, when it's time for Allison to give birth, Ben and her simply goes back together as if Alison's reasons for breaking from Ben in the first place never really mattered, a simple device to keep the plot boiling.<br/><br/>Finally, this is probably the first movie where I saw product placement for another movie playing at the same time in the theater: ""Spiderman 3"", also produced by Sony and released just a few week before ""Knocked up"" in theaters, is referenced twice, the characters expressing their urgent desire to see it, and James Franco, who stars in ""Spiderman 3"", makes a cameo, appearing in Alison's TV show where he discusses, you guessed it, his role in ""Spiderman 3""!"

","As I lived part of my life in the US, both coasts. I was able to read between the lines of the dubbed-into-Italian breakthrough Judd Apatow comedy and laugh. Most people dismissed it at the movie theater in Rome where I saw it. Thought it was vulgar and old hat. Vulgar? The Italians of the Massimo Boldi comedies thought it was vulgar?! ""Knocked Up"", besides making me laugh out loud and amusing me no end taught me a really important cultural lesson. We, in Italy, ride a very high (non existent) horse. I think the time has come for us to get off the horse and start looking at ourselves for what we really are - like we used to in Dino Risi, Pietro Germi and Mario Monicelli's films. ""Knocked Up"" is ultra sophisticated and yet, it reached a vast audience in the States because the sophistication is so amazingly smart. Seth Rogen is a real find. His eyes when he realizes Katherinre Heigl is going to stay with him that first and fatal night made me fall in love with his unlikely character. Katherine Heigl is another incredible discovery.

"joe_lvn","1","35","58","29 October 2007"," Hard to figure out how any critic would give this a good review.
","Basically, this was a sophomoric and very clichéd film with revolting toilet humor passing for comedy. And there really wasn't very much of this so-called ""comedy"" in the film. This was more of a dramatic movie. It might have been better played totally straight with much more originality. (I thought marijuana jokes kind of faded out with the 1970's). These ""adults"" acted more like children than children (as the song goes). And that also includes Katharine Heigl's character and the actress who played her bitch of a sister. Even when Seth Rogen supposedly becomes a ""mature"" man as the movie goes on, it's hard to really believe he will make a one hundred eighty degree turnaround in his ways. <br/><br/>Like I said, I absolutely cannot understand how this film was so highly praised and how so many critics said how funny it was. I hardly laughed at all. If there was a funny scene in this piece of garbage, it was the scene with Ryan Seacrest. All the characters were despicable, and the actors playing them couldn't even act. One of the worst, poorly written, poorly acted and atrocious films I've seen in a long time.

","CONTAINS SPOILERS THROUGHOUT<br/><br/>When I rented this movie, I expected a great comedy-all of the reviews I read gave it four stars. Well, imagine my surprise to find that this was one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. We, as viewers with half a brain, are supposed to be convinced that a beautiful, successful girl would schtoop a fat, nerdy, slacker and then wind up keeping his ""love child"" and pursue a relationship with him, all for the sake of the baby. Now that's a laugh.<br/><br/>How schizophrenic was this movie when the word ""abortion"" couldn't be used, but ""boobs and bush"" are the catchphrase of the film, not to mention the oodles of drug scenes and references to drug use throughout? Don't get me started on Alison-was she so lonely and desperate that she had to keep Ben around-and hang out with his weirdo, freaked out stoner friends? What was with the lame storyline with his friend growing his hair and his beard, just to be subjected to the jokes about Middle Eastern terrorists? It was a one-note joke that lasted until the movie! Besides Ben, she did not have a single friend in the whole film, unless you count her vapid, bitchy sister who doesn't deserve to have the great husband and beautiful children she has. So her husband plays fantasy baseball! It's better than listening to her whine and bully him every second they are together. Her voice was so annoying, it made me want to put my head in the oven and turn the gas on high! It was anti-feminist (if a young woman on the fast track in a dream career living with her sister in a cottage on their estate can't raise a baby by herself, who can? Why choose to keep the baby at all? It's not like it would be her last chance!), misogynistic (what in the world was the deal with all of the breasts and vagina jokes-not to mention that we got treated to someone's whoozywhatsis pushing out a ""baby's head""), and had no likable characters. Alison was annoying and needy, Ben was socially retarded and completely incapable of acting like a normal person until he lost Alison, his friends were repulsive, Debbie was mean and self-centered-what was that stupid freakout scene with the doorman all about? Talk about living in a fantasy world! Pete was a dork who should have thought that Debbie did him a favor when she kicked him out of the house for (gasp-having a hobby all of his own, that didn't involve her whiny self) and he had absolutely no self respect by crawling back to her and allowing her to emasculate him completely. Even the shopping around for OB/GYNs was ridiculous and completely unfunny. The awkward sex between Ben and Alison, was the icing on the crap-cake. How many times did he say he didn't want the baby to get hit in the face with his Johnson? Aye carrumba!!! Must we be subjected to hear him explain to Alison the true meaning of the phrase ""Doggy style?"" Blech! This movie was a horrible piece of drivel, and it's a sorry state of affairs when critics say it's one of the funniest films of the year.<br/><br/>It gets one out of ten stars, and when I say that I am being generous."
"EUyeshima","8","86","158","2 June 2007"," No Pregnant Pauses in A Sharp, Often Hilarious Character-Driven Comedy with Loads of Heart
","Probably because there is something fundamentally poignant about watching people you deem hopeless stumbling toward responsibility, this movie reminds me of the old Natalie Wood/Steve McQueen dramedy, 1963's ""Love With the Proper Stranger"", about a Macy's salesgirl who gets impregnated by a ne'er-do-well jazz musician during a one-night stand and then tracks what happens afterward. However, this is the 21st century, and the girl is now an interviewer on E!, and the guy is a very non-McQueen-like slacker in this uproarious and quite humane 2007 comedy, the latest work from writer/director Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""). In both comedies, he manages an amazing balancing act between a raunchy, post-frat hilarity and a shrewdly observed social commentary. Yet, there is no discernible fluctuation in the humor or the genuinely good spirit the films generate. Blessedly free of exhausting crescendo moments, the dialogue has a nice ramshackle feel and so do the characters. You really feel you want to know what happens to them after the film ends.<br/><br/>The story looks at the outset like your standard Hollywood opposites-attract rom-com as it centers on the burgeoning relationship between Ben Stone, the perfectly named definition of a slacker, and Alison Scott, the beautiful entertainment reporter. They meet at a trendy LA bar where she is celebrating her promotion to on-air personality. Ben buys her a beer, and she is impressed enough by his unexpected chivalry to keep him company. One thing leads to another, and you can guess the rest. But what you can't guess so easily is how these characters respond to the situation and to each other. There is also a surrounding gallery of characters offering their own opinions about what is developing, in particular, Alison's acerbic older sister Debbie, who is facing a crisis of her own as the control-freak wife of passively dissatisfied husband Pete. Their story intertwines nicely with the main plot line to the point where each makes the other more resonant.<br/><br/>Familiar faces from ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" return in this movie beginning with Seth Rogen, who proves he can carry a movie as Ben. Despite outward appearances to the contrary, his shaggy-dog demeanor and sometimes piercing self-deprecation provide much of the heart in the picture. As a last-minute substitute for Anne Hathaway, Katherine Heigl proves she can translate her natural likability on ""Grey's Anatomy"" to the big screen with ease. As Alison, she shows herself to be the rare actress who can be drop-dead gorgeous, smartly aware and genuinely non-judgmental. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann, who memorably demanded French toast while driving drunkenly through LA in ""Virgin"", is terrific as Debbie, an often-irritating mass of neuroses whom you somehow like despite herself. She has a great self-revelatory scene with a bouncer outside the same bar we see at the beginning. Paul Rudd plays Pete in his deceptively casual manner with a standout scene stoned in a Vegas hotel room.<br/><br/>Harold Ramis has a nice small scene as Ben's proud dad, while Ben's friends are an assortment of slacker-types played out like a well-tuned improv troupe. My one complaint about the film is just some of the sluggish pacing toward the last third of the film, the same problem I had with ""Virgin"". A running time of 129 minutes seems a bit long for the story being told here, though the birthing scene is hilariously executed, in particular, a scene-stealing bit by Ken Jeong as the passive-aggressive gynecologist called on to deliver the baby at the last minute. One other minor irritant are the deliberate references to ""Virgin"" in some of the dialogue between Ben and Pete. Regardless, this is one smart, heartfelt character-driven farce that far exceeded my expectations."

","I really don't understand why everyone carried on about this movie like it was the best one ever made. I seriously did not laugh once during the whole film, I don't understand how you can call this crap comedy, if you ask me it was more depressing than humorous. So it's obviously about a woman who got a really good job, who was knocked up by this loser, how predictable you know what is going to happen. It's all a happy ending as they decide to put their troubles aside and become a family, instead of taking the logical step and having an abortion. Whats in-between the beginning and end though is pathetic, no in fact it's probably more entertaining to watch a blank screen for 133 minutes. The actress that played Debbie was the most annoying character I have ever seen, all she ever does is complain and bitch the whole time. Please do not waste time/money to see this crap, if you really need to know the (obvious) plot, look up the film on Wikipedia, it will be a better use of your time. By the way, if you just want to see this film for nudity, there is a bit of nipple and that's it don't bother.<br/><br/>This film is only rated 1 out of 10, because there is no 0 on this scale.

","I saw this recently and left with a stomach ache from laughing so hard. I watched 40 Year Old Virgin again to make a fair assessment, and i found this to be funnier. Don't get me wrong, I love all of Judd Apatow's work, but this to me was the best thing since Freaks & Geeks. Apatow has a brilliant way of letting the audience get to know all of the characters(anyone who has seen his stuff will know that it is a lot and usually the same people)which gives you the feeling that you are a part of what's going on, and makes you interested. By now, I am sure everyone is familiar with the plot summary. Couple meets, hooks up and surprise she's pregnant. I find it amusing that some of the previous comments mention that it it such an unbelievable concept. Well of course it is, it's a movie!!! But come on, is it not entirely true that someone would hook up on a celebratory night out with someone they normally wouldn't? Of course they would! Thus, the meeting of Alison( Ketherine Heigl) and Ben (Seth Rogen)seems so genuine and awkward. The aftermath is the best part though. Since this is a movie, trying to make the best out of a bad situation is a given. The getting to know someone AFTER they have gotten you pregnant, meeting family and friends, realizing the many differences you have, etc. All of this is explored is very realistic fashion, especially the emotion and the trying to have sex while six months along!! Of course the whole thing can't be comedy. With so many other characters to help take the focus off the main two, there will be parts of the story that are more ""serious"". True is the case towards the end with Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) having a falling out. This is a very nice, but what seems eternally long, scene about the importance of understanding in a relationship. Could that be the moral of our story Alison and Ben, understanding and acceptance? I think so. Naturally the only thing left is birth and the happily ever after. The hospital scene is definitely NOT for the squeamish. I really hope those parts are not cut from the movie, because they received some of the most reactions. I found this whole seen to be painfully realistic, more so than any other movie has dared to be. Finally, the happy ending is upon us and the closing credits are filled with family snapshots and even childhood photos of cast and crew, very cute. So to you the potential viewer I say that this is an exceptional comedy. It is definitely the funniest thing I have seen this year. I will definitely be seeing it again to see all the parts I missed while laughing. And I must say I was absolutely delighted to see both Martin Starr (do NOT leave the theater during the scenes with his girlfriend) and Loudon Wainwright. Put one more in the win column for Judd Apatow."

","This was a very comical movie. I went into the viewing with mild expectations; after all, the previews were decent and Cal from 40-Year Old Virgin was to play a lead role. These expectations were far surpassed. The film did not loose steam at all as the plot progressed, and the audience was enthralled throughout in addition to being thoroughly entertained. The movie also had aspects that appealed to the more serious issue at hand. There were an abundance of one-liners and the film was very well written and produced. All in all, this is the best comedy after a comedic drought lasting from the summer of 2005 with the departure of Wedding Crashers and 40 Year Old Virgin from screens. This is a must see and a great relief to those that enjoy a good laugh and have been neglected for two years."

","If you thought there was something off with ""40 y/o Virgin"" but couldn't quite put your finger on it, here are some words of caution for this movie.<br/><br/>This film is extremely boring. It sets for itself an extremely high bar for humor and shock that it never meets. It also strives for a level of emotionality that is never reached due to the barrage of immature and unfunny stoner/dick jokes. Moreover, just when you think a scene is going to redeem the randomness of the previous scene, another completely unrelated plot twist comes from way out of left field, towing along more juvenile jokes that I doubt 14 y/o boys would find humorous.<br/><br/>Also equally unbelievable is how a hot career woman like Allison would've given a mess like Ben the time of day. Fast-forward past the unbelievable detail Apatow tries to (unsuccessfully)force you to believe, it's never fully explained satisfactorily why she wouldn't have opted for an abortion. It's discussed in passing and lightly, and considering how her character was built, it's pretty unbelievable that she wouldn't have chosen to terminate the pregnancy instead of having a baby with someone she needs to LEARN to respect EVENTUALLY. ""Unbelievable"" is unquestionably the key word in this movie.<br/><br/>I fell into this ridiculous hype, and I hope most of you will wait until your friend pays for the DVD rental and invites you over to watch this movie. Just be prepared to be bored and disappointed."
"oldschoolfilmcritic","2","36","64","5 June 2007"," Disappointment
","There is nothing humorous about watching adults stuck in adolescence. Ben Stone has a lot of growing up to do and Judd Apatow's suggestion that his protagonist has finally achieved that finally in the last minutes is wholly unbelievable. I also find it incredulous that a smart woman like Heigl's character would EVER fall in love with a pathetic character like Ben Stone, let alone ever go home with him for a one-night stand. An implausible premise. Mr. Apatow does know how to write comedy; THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN is a much better example, although in that case he was working with much better actors: Steve Carell and the wonderful Catherine Keener. Stay home and wait for this one to come out on DVD."
"rocket26","1","18","29","10 January 2008"," Is this actually a comedy?
","To be honest, I don't understand how this got so many good reviews from critics. Have movies just gone so far downhill that this is considered good?<br/><br/>Instead of a web site that reports how soon there is nudity, perhaps somebody should create a web site about how much vulgarity there is in a movie. Something tells me that this movie would rate very high on that list. The shameless cameos from has been actors, combined with an annoying amount of product placement make this movie seem even worse than it is.<br/><br/>Having said that, its hard to imagine how a movie could be much worse. Lackluster acting, bad script, and more recycled jokes than I can count made this movie incredibly painful to watch. The jokes were so juvenile that the actors seemed to laugh at their own lines like a sitcom where the audience is in front of the camera, rather than behind.<br/><br/>I plan to warn everybody I know who hasn't seen it, not to watch this terrible excuse for a movie.

","I am (won't say 'was' yet) a huge fan of Judd Apatow and to a lesser degree Seth Rogen who has worked with him for many years now. I thought ""Freaks & Geeks"" as well as ""Undeclared"" were both amazing and showcased kids who were 14 going on 40. Unfortunately for ""Knocked Up"" the characters are 40 going on 14. Are we supposed to care or even feel empathetic toward ANY of these characters? Looking at many of the other IMDb reviews, I think Rogen and Apatow hugely missed the mark here. Throughout the movie I kept HOPING that Rogen's character would have ONE decent quality. Then SUDDENLY he does an about face and gets a job -- sorry how does an illegal alien get such a fantastic job - much less any job with no work experience?? Right - suspension of disbelief - this film requires a lot of that.<br/><br/>1 star because we know Apatow can do better - can't he?"
"jdesando","Null","64","128","30 May 2007"," It may turn out to be the best comedy of the summer.
","A girl being ""knocked up"" in the past was as bad as a girl not having a cell phone today. The big A was not an acceptable remedy, and social rejection was pretty much routine.<br/><br/>The new film Knocked Up shows how far we have come. The tension surrounding a non-condom night of drinking is less a social disaster than a question of how the two principals can mature enough to deserve the gift. Director Judd Apatow carries his talent from 40 Year Old Virgin into this light and endearing comedy.<br/><br/>Both Seth Rogen (a buddy in Virgin) as Ben Stone and Katherine Heigl (The Ringer and Grey's Anatomy) as Alison Scot have perfect comic timing while the dialogue has an old screwball comedy pace, rapid and bright, affectionate and tough. Apatow nicely plays off the slacker Seth (Rogen may be better than Jon Heder's Napoleon) against Alison, a compulsive E! Entertainment reporter. When Stone first sees Alison naked, he blurts out, ""You're prettier than I am,"" an obvious truth that brings sympathy for the underachieving, slightly pudgy protagonist. Jokes and insight are hard to put togetherApatow does it here.<br/><br/>Whether or not these two victims of the demon alcohol will find love is for you to find out. However, you can be sure along the way to laugh at such naughty riffs as Seth's worry during lovemaking about his penis hitting the baby or the scenes where he and his stoner buddies concoct a for-profit website to show the specific occurrences of stars' nudity in films. You may not laugh at the graphic birth scenes, but you will be drawn closer to the lovers because of them.<br/><br/>Although the film is long at 132 min., it may turn out to be the best comedy of the summer."

","So my friend and her boyfriend rent this movie...they invite my boyfriend and I over to the apartment to watch it. None of us knew what to really expect, so we sat down with our bowls of popcorn and waited to be entertained.<br/><br/>Out of 4 people, 0 of them were entertained in the least by this ridiculously vile piece of tripe.<br/><br/>The plot isn't too unbelievable: a pretty, successful woman imbibes a bit too much at a bar and takes home what she sees as a charming, sexy fellow. They have sex. She gets pregnant. Despite the fact that 'Ben' is a jobless, drug-addicted slob of a man, she still wants to keep the baby and raise it with it's father. That doesn't sound to bad right? Wrong.<br/><br/>The plot, while predictable, had the potential to be rather sweet and funny. However, it was so bogged down with disgusting dialogue and awkward scenes, I lost all empathy for the characters and plot. The script was offensive in every way, to every type of person. The man/woman stereotypes were completely over the top: Seriously, does the director think that every woman is a Molotov cocktail of conflicting emotions? Is it THAT necessary to say 'fuck' every other word? Vagina jokes? Stabs at other races/religions? Are we adolescent children just learning about sex who giggle every time someone says fart and penis? Apparently so! They might love this movie!<br/><br/>The acting was very good, when it wasn't oozing with said foulness. Sadly, the decent acting took up perhaps...20 minutes of the film. Perhaps the most awkward, poorly done scenes were the sex scenes between pregnant Allison and Ben. It just dragged on, and on, and on, due to Ben's reluctance to smack the baby in the face during sex, which he commented on ENTIRELY too much. <br/><br/>No...I take it back. The MOST awkward moment? The birthing scene, the camera panning between Allison's legs to show a baby starting to pop out.

"snow0r","8","44","87","20 August 2007"," fantastic
","Knocked Up is a comedy about pregnancy, love, and marriage, that has far more intelligence and emotional depth to it than somewhat its flippant title would suggest. Ben (Rogen) is a layabout bum who lives with his stoner friends, ""working"" on a celebrity porn movie website. Alison (Heigl) has just been promoted at E!, and when she heads out to celebrate, their worlds collide with disastrous and of course hilarious consequences.<br/><br/>The comedy is clever and insightful, loaded with little self-referential moments and pop culture references (the Munich one is particularly awesome), and while it occasionally veers toward the puerile, the movie's subject matter ensures that the humour remains considered and intelligent for the most part. The performances are outstanding, but not just in terms of comic timing. Rogen appears built for this sort of balanced role as he realises that he has to grow up to meet the challenges of relationships and parenthood, and Heigl is just as effective as she learns to accommodate Ben's lifestyle and releases her grip on her career. The support from Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann is also brilliant. While their conflict-ridden marriage doesn't make them the greatest of role models for Ben and Alison, it certainly provides lots of laughs, and the clashes between Mann's overly paranoid Debbie and Rudd's laid-back Pete provide an interesting projection of how Ben & Alison's relationship could turn out.<br/><br/>The Rudd & Rogen moments make for some of the movie's better lines, but their humour is finely balanced with that emotional depth that I mentioned before, making the characters far more than punchline machines, which benefits the movie immeasurably. The awkward intimacy of Ben & Alison's almost-forced relationship also provides touching and comic moments, as Apatow examines what happens ""when life doesn't care about your plan"". Even the serious, emotional scenes are laced with a sort of ironic, bittersweet humour, which again gives the characters a sense of realism but also makes the movie that bit more comfortable and reassuring.<br/><br/>A subject that could have been treated with a crass touch, Apatow remains in tune with his previous effort, The 40 Year Old Virgin, and chooses to focus on the impact the pregnancy has on the lives of the characters, allowing their actions and interactions to create the comedy as they come to terms with their new situation. His light touch makes Knocked Up touching, insightful, and very, very, funny."
"MovieAddict2016","6","38","76","9 August 2007"," I can see what people admire and praise about it - but I think some are going too far.
","""Knocked Up"" is a well-made, enjoyable comedy about the consequences of an unprotected one-night stand. It has dual lessons for its lead characters: Seth Rogen has to learn to grow up and accept responsibility and Katherine Heigl has to choose between a professional life as a television interviewer or a possibly less rewarding (as she sees it) life as a stay-at-home mom.<br/><br/>And because it's Judd Apatow, he handles the sex gags carefully and with enough maturity that it doesn't become another stale sex comedy. But I think some people jumping on the Apatow bandwagon are so eager to praise him as the ""Savior"" of the sex-comedy genre that they are overlooking some of the film's flaws.<br/><br/>First of all, if we're going to be picky, the comedy isn't very consistent. Which is OK - I'd prefer it that way - but when you see reviews touting it as ""the funniest movie of the year,"" expectations can't help but build.<br/><br/>I didn't think the acting was as good as in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" Seth Rogen is a great supporting actor - but I find him rather irritating as a lead character. His revelation at the end of the film, too, isn't very believable - they spend so much time focusing on his life as a slacker that the transition between him being a man-child and accepting responsibility is as realistic as a ""Rocky"" training montage; he has a heartfelt talk with his dad (Harold Ramis) and suddenly he's 100% willing to become committed. Okay.<br/><br/>I'm not a big Heigl fan, but she fit the role well here. Paul Rudd was the real scene-stealer, though. But he's thrown off-balance by the casting of Apatow's wife - can he PLEASE stop putting her in all his movies? She can't act.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an OK comedy - better than most of its genre - and the drama is more realistic than most sex comedies, but some people were so willing to jump on it as a ""masterpiece"" of its genre before it even came out that the hype just killed it for me."

I wish I hadn't wasted my time. But the popcorn was good, so it wasn't a total loss. There's nothing more to say, but I've got to use ten lines of text, so I'm going to ramble for a bit.

Doesn't their lexicon demand the noun F--- or the adjective F-----G in every sentence?<br/><br/>The gist of this mess is that a guy who needs a shave throughout the entire torture--a guy who doesn't work but instead hangs out with a group of potheads working on developing a raunchy website--a guy named Ben Stone played by Seth Rogen is lucky enough to have a one night stand with a most attractive TV personality called Alison Scott played by Katherine Heigl and an ACCIDENTAL pregnancy develops. Now what in the world Alison sees in Ben is beyond comprehension but too much liquor does odd things. <br/><br/>The rest of this abomination for a film centers around the pregnancy and the interaction of Ben's bum friends as well as Alison's classy gal pals.

The whole drug scene is abominable. I estimate the picture is 30 minutes too long. Newspaper columnists are giving this excuse for a movie four stars?

","'Knocked-Up' was far better than I had hoped. I was not impress with the '40 Year-Old Virgin' or 'Superbad' which were crass and uninspiring. 'Knocked-Up' in stark contrast still maintains the adolescence humor of '40 Year-Old Virgin' or 'Superbad' but is far more intelligent and witty, bordering at times on comedic brilliance. It is also able to match the comedy with a sincere thread throughout, which is hard to achieve. <br/><br/>Seth Rogen is great as the expectant father, I am unsure how much of the script was improvised but there were many moments of laugh-out-loud originality, the whole cast delivers on the acting front. At times the jokes can be a little too crude, but overall they are well managed. Special mention to the scene in the Las Vegas hotel between Rogen and Paul Rudd, high on mushrooms their interplay is spot-on and it is moments like this which make it memorable.<br/><br/>The one criticism I do have is the last 30 minutes, the gags do not seem to work as well due to the more serious tone, and the film lumbers a little. I respect that the film wanted to make an emotional punch at the end but it dallied a little too long.<br/><br/>'Knocked-Up' is an enjoyable film and I recommend that you make an effort to watch it."

There were tons of established actors in the film, who each added their own special something to the film. It is a great piece of screen writing. If you are looking for a serious drama look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a great comedy similar to Happy Gilmore, Old School or 40 year old virgin, look no further. Sure the plot line may be a little bit of a stretch, but no more than any of the movies mentioned above, and those were all classics. I highly recommend the film. If you like comedies, you'll love it!"

","This movie was more than disappointing- especially considering that I wasn't really expecting much to begin with. My biggest beef is that it was advertised as a semi-comedy when in reality it is a semi-depressing ""reality"" movie. And they don't leave much as a surprise because we've seen all the punch lines and the plot highlights in the previews.<br/><br/>So this is pretty much the story line: The pretty blond girl (Alison) and the not-so-attractive chubby guy (Ben) hook up by accident (as it often seems to be the case- at least in the movies and beer commercials) and well have sex without a condom- ooops. 8 weeks later she is pregnant and since in the end she decided to keep the baby the two of them decide to get to know each other and well- give the relationship a try and be responsible parents. But their lifestyles, attitude and personalities are somewhat different and well don't have any love sparks flying either so they go through lost of ups and downs through the movie but wait- their intentions are good and of course we have to have a happy ending so in the end they do make it after all, or so we'r led to believe as they drive in the sunset to a new sub-urban house. Awwwww...<br/><br/>Now that is all fine and well, but the movie is a) really not that funny b) not that original or complexed c) you still don't know if they will really make it because they are so different, and as we have seen through Alison's sister and her family- sometimes even with love it takes a lot to make a relationship and family function. So in the end, apart from some funny screaming and swearing moments, the movie is pretty blasé- supporting characters are OK but nothing special, there is no charming romance or memorable lines- I guess they wanted to make a 'reality movie' but in that case why spend 10$ to see it- I can just pull up a lawn chair and watch my neighbours.<br/><br/>p.s. The only person that makes this movie is definitely Miss Greys' - Katherine Heigl. Kudos to her."

","My low rating of one star (there is no opportunity to give it a lower score, unfortunately) is not because of the language, nudity, etc. I am no prude and am frequently profane and nude myself. <br/><br/>My only deal-breaker on anything is vomit. And it keeps showing up more and more. In fact, that car scene in ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" where the chick upchucks is the only thing I didn't like about ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" which I consider to be a work of genius. But if ""Knocked Up"" is any indication of what to expect from Apetow in the future, ""Virgin"" will stand alone among his work. Maybe all he had in him is the one genius fluke of ""Virgin"" -- the film-director equivalent of a one-hit wonder.<br/><br/>I was drawn to this film by ""Virgin,"" and the uniformly great reviews in the press and on TV of ""Knocked Up."" Never will I believe a review or movie hype again. (Read the IMDb reviews -- overwhelmingly negative.) Maybe I'll just watch Wes Anderson movies from now on. He reaches for the stars every time.<br/><br/>The casting of ""Knocked Up"" is the worst of my complaints, although the premise, writing and directing all compete for first place. I liked Seth Rogan in ""Virgin"" and I think Heigl is a beauty among beauties. But obviously that ""don't"" mean the woman can act. I have never watched ""Gray's Anatomy,"" so I was not familiar with her acting chops. Well, if this is an example of her best work, she is pitifully bad at what she does. I saw her bragging on herself on a TV interview about her delivery-room screaming. Even that was lame. If she had ditched the make up and appeared agonized and bathed in sweat, like in real life, it might have been a funny scene. Rogan and Heigl had no chemistry whatsoever. And, on top of that, we're supposed to believe that Heigl can't do any better than him and actually evolves into loving him. Now that's funny. <br/><br/>There was zero realism in any aspect of this movie, which certainly is NOT a comedy since there was nothing even remotely funny about it. Oh, except for Ryan Secrest, who did the best acting in the movie, and I don't even like Secrest.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was phony, lame and embarrassingly bad.

I was hoping Alison would get all hormonal on Jill and put the sourpuss in her place. Yell, scream, anything. The scenes with her bosses at E! are so boring and pointless, just like Jill.<br/><br/>But Debbie (Leslie Mann) was the worst of all. She's perpetually needy, puts down her husband every chance she gets, apparently has no life beyond her equally annoying kids and annoying sister Alison, and has a cow when her husband Pete (Paul Rudd) decides to do things without her, like join a fantasy baseball team? She dumps him for not doing things with her? WTF? That's not grounds for separation. Has it ever occurred to Debbie that maybe just maybe he wants to not be around an annoying shrew 24/7? Maybe he should've cheated on her. Having her as a wife would've been a perfect excuse to do so. And why would he want her to take him back? He should've stayed in Vegas and never looked back.

The movie was a total rip off, not funny, waste of time. The underlying premise is not believable, thus every thing that happens after the initial one night stand is pointless. I don't know what star system these characters live in, but I have been to many bars and have never seen a girl that looks like Kathryn Heigl go home with a guy who looks like Seth Rogen after just meeting him at a bar no matter how drunk or how much tic she has snorted previously that evening to have unprotected sex on a one night stand. How stupid and desperate is this girl? and on top of that we are supposed to believe she is an otherwise intelligent A-type personality who has it together who just made a mistake? For a guy who looks like Seth Rogen, knocking up that girl and having her keep the baby is the equivalent to winning countless scratch and win one dollar lotteries. On top of that, no women I know are dying to go out with fat, unemployed, pot heads, no matter how funny and how big their jew-fro is or how many stains they have on their shirts, I know this because that is what I look like. It's just a movie you may say, NO this was an insult to everyones intelligence involved in the film, watching the film or citizen of any country where this went to number one. On top of all this, we have a scene of Ryan Seacrest losing it off camera, like we are getting a glimpse into his non American Idol real personality, WHO THE $$$$ CARES ABOUT SEACREST? This was weird and not funny, edgy or smart. The scene with the bouncer was awkward and strange, I don't know what they were going for but in the world I live in you don't call someone a ""Faggot"" for doing their job and if you do you deserve to be pimp slapped. The only good thing about this film that I did enjoy was it strangely resembled watching a car wreck or trainwreck, it was mildly entertaining to see how low it would sink which too me I can go to a kindergarten class during recess and watch the kids play outside in the mud and get the same effect for free. His friends were lame and uninteresting, countless jokes about one of them having a beard, wow, lets think of how many times we can come up with different names to call a guy with a beard that is so funny! The Asian girl who was laughing at everything was unlike any stoner I ever knew, and I've know hundreds, The dialog which was supposed to pass for edgy or witty was just plain stupid and embarrassing, not embarrassing as in the Amish would blush, but embarrassing in the way that if you have more than a modula oblongata operating your bodily functions, and have conscious thought, you are sad and stunned that humans can pass this off as conversation. these are the types of people I have gone my entire life trying to avoid why would I want to watch a two hour movie with them? I'm amazed that this film made so much money, truly what passes for humor in this country is unbelievable.

The movie offers no general direction to Katherine's journey through pregnancy and continuity of the movie spirals into random scene after random scene. The only saving grace to the movie was that of Seth Green and Paul Rudd's ability to play off each other in what seemed to me to be natural chemistry, but still wasn't as good as how the tandem performed in 40 Year Old Virgin.<br/><br/>Finally, the believability of Katherine Haigl's character choosing to have the baby with such a loser as Seth Rogan's character is laughable to say the least.

","Pete: Marriage is like a tense, unfunny version of Everybody Loves Raymond, only it doesn't last 22 minutes. It lasts forever. <br/><br/>Going into 'Knocked Up' I was expecting a lot. After seeing his last film, the side-split-tingly funny '40 Year Old Virgin', I noticed I was quickly becoming a big Judd Apatow fan. If I were to say 'Knocked Up' met my expectations, I'd be lying. Honestly, I loved it, but I was expecting so much more from it than great one-liners and a good story. I was expecting one of the funniest movies I've seen, and that's not what I got. 'Knocked Up' is very funny, but there's only one or two scenes where the funny level drifts into the 'hysterical' zone, so to speak. <br/><br/>The story is kind of familiar. Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is an out-of-shape ambition-less pothead. In most cultures we'd call him a loser. He and his less classy but very entertaining friends; Jay, Jason, Jonah and Martin, run a website that tells you exactly how far into movies hot celebrities get naked. Too bad none of them ever heard of Mr. Skin.com, a revelation they have later in the movie and find disheartening. One night, Ben and his buddies are at a club getting sh__t-faced, and Ben meets Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), an extremely attractive E! news anchor, and they have a drunken hook-up. Eight weeks later, Alison finds out she's pregnant due to Ben's condom mishap. Like anyone with a brain in their head could have predicted, Alison tells Ben, and Ben decides to take on the responsibilities of being a father. The two slowly start to fall in love with each other during the ordeal.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, I was pleasantly surprised. Seth Rogen surprised the hell out of me in his capability as a leading man. His acting isn't half-bad and he's very convincing in his role consistently through-out the film. Rogen is also hilarious for the most part, in both his dialogue and screen presence. Katherine Heigl also gives a merit-able performance. She's not nearly as funny as Rogen, but she's not over-the-top like most female leads in these kinda movies (like Jennifer Aniston in 'The Break-Up' -- pbbt!) I've heard from many people Heigl is good in 'Grey's Anatomy', but I wouldn't know, I don't watch that stupid friggin' show. Leslie Mann is humorous as Alison's annoying sister, and Paul Rudd is excellent in his role as Alison's sister's husband who compares marriage to a very long and unfunny episode of 'Everybody Loves Raymond'. Rudd, whose proved himself with commendable work in 'The Shape of Things' and 'The Cider House Rules', is without question the best actor in the film and his performance adds a lot to it. 'Knocked Up' also has a number of interesting cameos from people like Ryan Seacrest, Jessica Alba, Steve Carrell, and my personal favorite, Mo Collins as a gynecologist. <br/><br/>Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen's writing is perhaps the strongest aspect of the movie in most cases. Apatow and Rogen provide some ingenious one-liners that in more ways than one are the saving grace of the movie when it gets kinda boring towards the final 20 minutes. But that's the thing -- 'Knocked Up' relies on one-liners instead of big extravagant physical comedy sequences to make it funny. This is where one of the biggest problems of the film lies. This would be fine if the one-liners were more prolific than they are here. There's just too many dull blocks of time in 'Knocked Up' to make this type of comedic approach work as successfully as it could.<br/><br/>You may think by reading my review, I hated the film, when in fact I really quite enjoyed it. I was just sorely disappointed in it. There are many parts in the film that are genuinely funny and the film isn't sappy in it's dramatic moments, it's just such a let-down from '40 Year-Old Virgin', 'Borat', or some of the other REALLY good comedies that have been released in the last two years. But there is a lot more to like about the movie, than there is to dislike about it. I recommend it to anyone looking to have a fun time at the movie theater in a year where movies just flat-out suck. In a summer where the god-awful 'Spider-Man 3' and sleep-inducing 'Pirates 3' lead the box office, 'Knocked Up' is a freakin' godsend. Grade: B+"
"zkonedog","8","2","2","5 March 2017"," Extremely Crude...But With Heart
","The best way to describe ""Knocked Up"" is this: If a movie like ""Superbad"" actually had a shred of dramatic integrity (e.g. ""a point"") to add to its crude, sometimes gross-out antics, you'd have this comedy.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Knocked Up"" sees stoner Ben (Seth Rogen) and straight-laced Allison (Katherine Heigl) hook up during a drunken one-night stand. When Allison finds out that she is pregnant, she must decide not only what to do about her ""situation"", but also try to include Ben in the process.<br/><br/>To be very frank, this is one of the crudest movies ever made, filled with gross-out images, a boatload of profanity, and sexual zingers at literally almost every turn. If these are things that you are uncomfortable with, then turn the other way and run right now!<br/><br/>At the same time, ""Knocked Up"" does have one key attribute that most of its contemporaries lack: heart. When you wade through all the stoner jokes, sexual innuendo, and the like, you actually get a story that you might just find yourself caring about. It touches on a variety of different marital/relationship themes, and the tremendous acting of Heigl/Rogen helps to add a legitimate emotional dynamic to the proceedings.<br/><br/>Basically, ""Knocked Up"" is Judd Apatow's pulling together of the traditional romantic comedy and the stoner/goofball genre, a pairing that one would think wouldn't work all that well. It does in this case, though, because the overall effort is taken seriously enough to produce a perfect mix of well-crafted jokes from all areas of life. Unless you are turned off by the crudeness, you will be both laughing at and caring about the characters in this movie."
"mahalkosimaf","8","2","2","14 May 2009"," Vulgar and Offensive but by no means dull.
","I finally had the chance to see Judd Apatow's follow-up movie to his monster hit the 40-yr old Virgin. I've read reviews about this one and after watching the movie, I can understand why so many women think this movie is sexist (and too vulgar). Even its ridiculously pretty star Katherine Heigl is on record calling this movie ""a little sexist,"" and elaborates:<br/><br/>""It paints women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as goofy, fun-loving guys. It was hard for me to love the movie.""<br/><br/>I don't think that's the case however. Heigl's comment seemed to me that she was looking at the glass half-empty instead of half-full. Yes, one female character, Debbie (Leslie Mann) was shown to be a bit of a nagger, and one of those clingy type but she was that way only because she puts premium on having a close relationship with her husband. She says she likes to have him ""around"" and wouldn't mind watching Spiderman 3 with him. I know a lot of guys who would kill for a girl like that.<br/><br/>There was a scene also wherein Debbie showed her husband a ""sexual-offenders"" map of their neighborhood, Debbie takes offense when her husband, seemingly uninterested, jests, ""So we'll skip those houses when we go trick-or-treat."" Some say this particular scene paints Debbie as ""uptight"" while the husband is cool and ""goofy"". But the flip-side is, any guy could blow off and say: ""Hey! this scene shows men as ""insensitive"" and portray women as ""concerned,""that's a little unfair"" See? easier to see it half-empty than half-full.<br/><br/>Then there's Heigl's character Alison, well on her way to a successful promotion in her job as an Entertainment News correspondent until a night of celebration with a little too much booze ends up in her getting pregnant from a one-nighter with a jobless, pot-smoking overweight dimwit named Ben. Alison here is portrayed as a career woman (rarely bad) while Ben is shown as your stereotypical man-baby, slacking and getting high in the daytime while turning into lecherous bar prowlers at night. Now if there's anyone who should be offended by this, I don't think it should be the ladies. I mean C'mon!? men are not ENTIRELY like that! (You can stop snickering now lady hehe)<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that Knocked-Up showed weaknesses in BOTH sexes and is a very funny movie because there is honesty in it-- Men, being ""men"" and women being ""women.""<br/><br/>The plot may be a bit tired (slackers finally owning up to responsibilities) but the humorous banter between the characters and the subtle commentary breathes life into an otherwise mediocre shot at comedy."

Along with realism to do with relationships as a whole, be it sexual, marriage or friendship.<br/><br/>I don't know why more people haven't said that.<br/><br/>From the part where Leslie Mann is screaming at the door man and see screams 'door man, door man'. To when Paul Rudd and Rogan are on mushrooms and their back and forward banter shows that they've definitely had psychedelics before.<br/><br/>I've read a whole bunch of reviews that complain about the unrealisticness of a guy like rogans character getting a girl Heigel's. But people, it really isn't all that unrealistic at all.<br/><br/>The movie has a whole lot of 'classic moments'. A lot of them being in the last half an hour, being one of the main strenghts of the movie, especially in terms of re-watch value.<br/><br/>Truly a bad review, sorry.

"bkwunder","1","21","44","8 July 2007"," Coarse & Crude
","Knocked Up is offensive in almost every way. The writers -- vocabulary-challenged -- resort to using the F-bomb throughout the movie, along with other language that confirms that our country's educational system has been dumbed down, severely dumbed down. It's really too bad because the basic story line would offer great potential to truly talented writers (e.g., keep the baby vs. having an abortion; physical & emotional changes caused by pregnancy; accept or run from responsibility). Funny and serious would not be mutually exclusive when handled by writers of good ability.<br/><br/>Both men and women are the subject of assault in this film. The men are drug and sex- crazed; or weak, immature or brain-fried. The women are petty, shallow and shrewish (although Miss Heigl escapes this movie without damage (other than guilt by association)). Children are not spared either. The director uses his own children in this film and even has them reciting lines about genitalia.<br/><br/>Don't think that the coarse script is the only offense. The movie is also visually offensive -- directed and filmed to give life to the crass and crude script.<br/><br/>If you want to see Miss Heigl, watch her on the small screen in Grey's Anatomy, or rent ""Love Comes Softly,"" a touching, well-written period film. As for ""Knocked Up,"" don't waste your time or your money."

","I am so disappointed in this film. Maybe I'm getting too old I guess to find humor in some of the horrible scenarios portrayed here. Typically I can go by the ratings on IMDb to tell me what will be a good movie to see, but boy was I wrong this time. There was only very few good things about this film. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann were great in it, although I think it gave a horrible name to ""marriage."" Otherwise, I think that was about it. The whole plot idea that some successful young woman would fall for a lewd foul-mouthed moron like Ben is just totally ludicrous. Whether pregnant or not, it wouldn't happen. Then there's the cussing and nudity - come on, seriously, aren't we a little bit beyond that stupid humor? And did we really have to see Allison's vagina during the birthing scene? What really was the purpose of that? We get it...she's giving birth...ha, ha....real funny. Honestly, if I could've, I would have given this movie a zero because I thought it was THAT bad."

","I saw this movie with a free movie pass the week before it was released to theaters and let's just say I am glad I did not have to pay to see it. I thought it was okay, not bad, not good, but sort of in the middle, hence the 5/10 rating. What I thought was funny is that all of the: ""This movie is Spectacular"" ""The Best Comedy in Years"" reviews were all coming from guys below the age of 30 or at least 35. While I must admit I am not a fan of the ""Crude Dude"" male humor we see in movies year after year I can usually put up with it. Is it me or is it a new trend in movies that men cannot be funny or comical unless they are making raunchy sex jokes, getting wasted and looking like complete buffoons? I can get into that kind of humor, but I am afraid this is Judd Apatows niche and sooner or later it will get old. The one thing I didn't like about this movie is that the women were made to seem like they had it together while the men were the ones with the problems. Maybe I just have a more dry sense of humor after all my favorite comedies tend to be more ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Spinal Tap""."

It goes on forever, has long stretches of dialogue that had me screaming ""CUT!"", and sticks us with some of the most strident characters I've seen in a long time. (For more than two hours, no less.) They do virtually nothing else but bicker, bitch and moan about what tough lives they have. Woe is me! I'd love a huge house in L.A. and a Lexus, or to lay around getting stoned all day, or have a great job with E!. Give me a break. At least 40 Year Old Virgin had believable characters you cared about. I couldn't give one fat turd for anyone in this movie, and I didn't believe any of the relationships anyway.

","So much good buzz over Knocked Up. Turns out all the buzzing was done by retarded bees. This was not a good movie and I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>The characters were mostly despicable and, worse, not believable as real people. Real twenty-something men, crude and disgusting though they may be, are not as crude and disgusting as the men in this movie. Real people as successful as Pete and Debbie do not behave the way they did in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was unable to convince us there was anything real between Ben and Allison. They had zero chemistry and zero physical, emotional or intellectual connection. Zero. So, it didn't make sense that they would have sex in the first place. It didn't make sense that this successful woman would EVER consider keeping that loser's baby. And it didn't make sense that Allison would fall in love with Ben. Yeah, the script can say they fell in love and the actor's can mouth the words at the right time but they sure didn't convince us.<br/><br/>The movie employed bad actors. We already knew Ryan Seacrest and James Franco can't act. But, worse, Ken Jeong as Dr. Kuni, was awful.<br/><br/>Cameo roles by Office personnel (BJ Novac, Craig Robinson, Steve Carell) took us right out of the story. ""Oh, look, there's Ryan.""<br/><br/>The movie was way too long. The editing was atrocious. If I can tell that, why couldn't the director and the film editor tell? <br/><br/>I gave it one star to counteract the mindless overpraise Knocked Up generated. It's really about a 3-star movie. It would be okay as background noise when you're cleaning your house."

I cannot fathom how any person would crown this movie as funny, buy the DVD, and sit through it without getting paid.<br/><br/>Studios need to take more pride in their humor and not take advantage of the mechanically and spiritually dead that would pay to watch this drivel."

I can hardly suggest anything to substantiate any rating higher than 6 if I am not mistaken about the rough reference I normally observe on this website. The bar of 7.8 is certainly set far too unrealistic for this movie. 4.8 maybe a fairer estimate for the general audience. Everything is on the surface and nothing much underneath throughout the movie, which is considerably too long-winded as it runs for more than 2 hours based on a story which couldn't be more expected, at times unbelievable and lacking originality. Plot is simply unconvincing. <br/><br/>If you are looking for some mindless soapy entertainment from a typical Hollywood hasty production, which has probably no correlation to what is happening in the real world (especially for a young lady working in the showbiz industry in Hollywood) and don't really have better things to do with your 130 minutes, please go and watch this."

Men and women issues come out on the screen with a great sense of frustration each sex feels for the other but KNOCKED UP delivers these issues in an amusing fashion.<br/><br/>The audience in Westwood (Los Angeles) really enjoyed the film and the laughs kept rolling along with the picture.

You'd think that would be enough to keep the movie from being a total bust.

These sidekicks are supposed to be in their early 20's but they are like a troupe of 15 year old boys who revel in fart jokes, pubic hair, put downs, drugs, and the dream of getting laid. It was a BAD version of American Pie. The sidekicks had nothing interesting or endearing to offer. They curse incessantly without consideration of who else is in their presence, as if they just learned these words and feel the need to practice, or out do one another.<br/><br/>Sure, men need space, and they need to be guys... but this movie portrays single men as absolute dimwits. While the lead male evolves along the way, none of the band of buddies do. At one point in the film I couldn't decide whether it was anger or pain that was causing me to shift constantly in my seat as I watched. The film should be reedited. Cut out about 5 minutes of the sister, cut out 5 minutes of her husband, cut out 20 minutes of the 'boys' -- and give us about 10 minutes back of Katherine M.

","Hollywood's formula for comedy today is, with few exceptions, a slap in the face to movie goers who actually have to pay to watch this drivel. It's pretty simple. The men,as always, have I.Q.'s less than 90 and operate under the belief that their behavior is appropriate for all situations, or worse yet, ""cute"" and endearing to the female of the species. The women, on the other hand, appear smart (well sort of), mature (but only in comparison to the men) and competent (but not for long!). However, this movie is an equal opportunity offender as the women quickly get dragged into the abyss and are exposed as facilitators of male behavior at best, or just ""part of the gang"" at worst. The story really doesn't matter because we'll be laughing too hard to keep up with any annoying details, plot points or nuance that could make this anywhere near an ""intelligent comedy."" And this, Hollywood informs us, makes for a great night at the movies and is, after all, what we want. And, for those who think that things are only funny when you're drunk or stoned and like their characters that way, Hollywood is right on the mark.<br/><br/>Well, this one couldn't be more formulaic and touches all the bases. Our male lead is an immature, self-centered, 23 year old slacker who spends all his time (of course he has no job, what would be the fun in that?) smoking pot and watching porn. He is supported in this mindless endeavor by his equally hilarious roommates who deliver all the stoner and toilet humor we could want. Our female lead, is a smart, beautiful career woman who is quickly rendered incredible by actually falling for this loser who gets her (yes, you guessed it!) ""knocked up."" She soon looses her job and spends her time helping her boyfriend ""review"" adult movies proving, once again, that comedy is best when everybody gets stupid.<br/><br/>And, you know what? The acting wasn't bad. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl did all they could with this stinker of a script. This movie puts to rest, once and for all, the question of which is worse: bad acting or bad writing. Unless you think there is an inherent humor in everybody ""gettin' stoopid,"" then there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie. If, in reality, men were as childish as this and women fell for it, there would be no one laughing. But, I guess that's why they call it comedy and why humor means something different for everybody. But aren't there enough humorous situations in life that we could play on without having to resort to characterizing ourselves as idiots? This one does not pass the ""What Would The Aliens Think If They Saw This"" test.<br/><br/>This movie may have made an attempt to touch on an appropriate subject: the choice to have a baby instead of an abortion. Of course, there's nothing ""funny"" about that so they glossed over it (in about 30 seconds of screen time) and concentrate instead on moronic humor and completely unbelievable human interaction that is all stupidity based. But that 30 seconds of screen time was enough to have the critics calling this mess a ""smart comedy."" <br/><br/>The movie does succeed in making one (unintended) point: if people this irresponsible bring children into the world, we're all in trouble."

It reminded me of that Seinfeld episode when George Costanza tells an attractive woman in the diner ""I'm unemployed and I live with my parents"" and she turns to him with interest and says ""Hiiii!"" or something like that.<br/><br/>In contrast, the relationship in The 40-Year-Old Virgin was sweet, quirky, enjoyable and much more realistic. All the characters were great and the jokes in that movie came thick and fast. There were a number of very funny moments in this film too, but there were also scenes that were very unrealistic or boring--i.e., the one with the bouncer outside the club, and part of the Vegas scene. I really wanted to smack the married sister and tell her to get a life. If I were Paul Rudd's character I would have been out of there pronto.<br/><br/>I did like it when the guys started to get into the back-and-forth insults that they used in TFYOV--I just wish there had been more of that. The two are both basically movies that accept and welcome nerdiness, quirkiness and difference, which is great. This one just didn't pull it off so well. I'd say, however, that if you're a teenage boy who likes to toke, you're going to love it!"

","I was disappointed with ""Knocked Up"" after all the hype. The best scenes are in the TV trailers. I won't give away any of the story in case anyone want to see for themselves to decide whether it's good or bad.<br/><br/>I didn't think was as funny as everyone says it was. Sure, it was slightly amusing in spots, almost bordering on clever, but hardly hilarious.<br/><br/>My butt started to go numb part way into the movie. Once it goes numb, too much time has gone by. The way I see it, the film ran 45 minutes too long. Two hours & seven minutes was way too much time for this story. A lot could have been left out. We all know the female lead was pregnant and about to give birth. Call me old fashioned, but the graphic shots in the delivery room were not necessary even if they were just quick edits. It was not necessary to show the baby crowning! This is NOT a documentary.<br/><br/>This film is an easy nominee for the Razzie awards."

","A ""fairly unattractive"" man. Who smokes weed. Has no life. Living off a compensation benefit. Meets a ""pretty"" woman. At a club. They both get drunk. Have sex. Woman becomes pregnant...<br/><br/>You get the drift, I could actually write this review in the same context all the way through. This is probably as close as to how the film has been constructed.<br/><br/>I can't say that I enjoyed the ""40 Year Old Virgin"" in fact, I thought it was boring, crap storyline, segments were funny, with random scenes and locations which had no relevance to the film to fill in extra minutes for your money, and so on, so forth. This is EXACTLY what happens in ""Knocked Up"".<br/><br/>What annoys me, is the fact that this film could of been so good. I wanted it to make that extra yard to make me fall out of my seat, so, so, so much. It just reminded me of crap sex, an ongoing ordeal that you think will come to something, and just when you think things are going your way, it all flops down.<br/><br/>I can't completely slag this film though, as Seth Rogan shows what a talented actor he can be in funny situations. I think he will be one to watch out for in the future for sure. He has some brilliant one liners it has to be said! Katherine Heigl also done a blinding performance, its such a shame, because the storyline and little plot-holes completely screwed them both over. They are big actors for the big comic bound occasion, its a shame they were blindfolded and given shocking scenario's to work with.<br/><br/>Of course it has its moments, but nothing that makes you go to pub with your mates and chat about it. I was very whole-heartedly disappointed with this film. So much speculation ruins a good thing ya' know? Possibly the most over-rated comedy of 2007. Yes. Down to the shoddy direction of the film.

"leifhou168","Null","15","34","2 June 2007"," An Character-Driven Joyride of Non-stop Hilarity
","Knocked Up is quite easily one of the best movies I have seen thus far this year. The story takes absolutely no time to be a drawn-out flick where you go, ""Make it stop!"" This movie is non-stop hilarity, a bit crude, but something that you can truly connect with and hits home with a heartwarming story of love and life.<br/><br/>The movie has a simple premise: two people who are seemingly ""living the dream""--Alison, an E! Channel Correspondent and Ben, a half-witted, pot-smoking celebrity nude website administrator along with his five estranged friends whom he also lives with--decide to hook up for a fateful one night stand after meeting at a night club. They do the nasty, and the two part ways after that. The story picks up once again 8 weeks later, as Allison finds herself pregnant with what she hilariously discovers to be Ben's child. At once we as the audience sympathize, even empathize with her at her situation with Ben and the pregnancy. As the movie proceeds we find ourselves riding through the radically changing lives of Ben and Alison from the moment that she breaks the news to him that he's the father to when they fall for each other to the ""irreconcilable differences"" and finally to the painful and slow phase of ""growing up"" and facing each other's, as well as their own, fears to accept and uncover the joys of giving life and becoming parents.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl do a wondrous job of being the two people that ""life came straight at, not caring about their plans"". Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann, portraying Alison's brother-in-law and sister, are fantastic supporting cast as we often find parallels between the two couples and how they are something of ""elders"" that show Ben and Alison what it's like to be parents, working both against and for them. Hell, the entire cast is incredible, the comedic timing is impeccable. And Judd Apatow, the man behind the 40 Year Old Virgin, has created yet another heart-warming laugh riot that is its own creation, not simply a rehash of the 40 Year Old Virgin as some would be led to believe.<br/><br/>GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!"

","Shallow, exploitative towards men, dull. But I have a question. Why do so many writers in sit-coms, commercials, comedy movies want to make men look so stupid and like such jerks? I think men and women everywhere are hungry to see strong, competent men (even when they are funny). Sit-coms have stopped standing for ""situation comedies"" and have instead focused all their humor towards making men look stupid and like jerks. Is it because the writers are incompetent or do they really think that men are like that? I think it's because they have been led to believe that they are, and I even think men no longer see themselves as strong and competent. Can't we have some writing that finds humor in the situation? We find ourselves in funny situations all the time. ""40-Year Old Virgin"" was in the same genre, written to make men look stupid."

"pyrocitor","9","8","16","22 September 2007"," Unexpectedly tender yet still satisfyingly rambunctious comedy
","With a title such as that, an audience is immediately given a sense of what to expect from such a film - a bawdy, vulgar examination of realistic events for the sake of comedy. Which, one must concede, is essentially what Knocked Up is... but director Judd Apatow, best known for his work on The 40 Year Old Virgin and television show Freaks and Geeks, is too cunning to coast by on such a premise. Instead, like in Virgin, surprising focus is bestowed on the touching, sentimental aspects of the story without shirking on the side-splittingly vulgar one liners, crafting an intricate balance between the tender and the raucous - the result being surprisingly credible, however quirky or profane. <br/><br/>Compared to most of Apatow's other efforts, Knocked Up boasts a far more mature tone and subject matter - while this summer's Superbad dealt with the transition from teenagehood, and 40 Year Old Virgin a juvenile man finally growing up, Knocked Up is concerned with the front of accidental adulthood and responsibility, and despite having a younger male lead, the film is all the more ""grown up"" as a result. The concept of a couple getting to know each other after having already drunkenly conceived a child is an intriguing (and frighteningly possible) one, and Apatow's script may not shy away from any of the more physical aspects of the pregnancy process (guffawing teenage viewers better get ready for lots of morning sickness vomiting, a substantial amount of gynaecologist talk, and a no punches pulled birth scene) but the film is all the more human as a result. <br/><br/>Of course, the majority of the success of a film centering in on an unexpected pregnancy would depend on the strength of its leads, and Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl prove more than up to the challenge, with tremendous chemistry, charm and wit. Rogen, a master at playing both gruffly charming and haplessly bewildered, easily merits his newfound leading man status - throughout the film, as Rogen's Ben Stone arcs from juvenile slacker to accidental future parent, he remains consistently endearing and sympathetic, as well as incredibly funny. Heigl also proves surprisingly charismatic and credible as the soon to be mother in question. Though her performance may come across as stunted at the film's beginning, we as the audience gradually realize that the character herself is fairly emotionally stunted, and not entirely clear who she is - right off the bat she is presented as an ambitious careerwoman still living in the guest room of her sister and brother-in-law's house. As the film (and the pregnancy) advances, Heigl is given more of a chance to flex her dramatic muscles, culminating in a highly satisfactory performance. <br/><br/>But despite the charm of the central couple, Apatow once again puts substantial focus on the supporting cast, extracting many a laugh from what could have been senseless archetype figures. Scene stealing Paul Rudd, and Leslie Mann (Apatow's real life wife) bicker excruciatingly as newlywed parents, and are a constant source of either laughter or justifiable disgust. Rogen's stoner buddies, including Jonah Hill and Jay Baruchel are consistently hilarious; a wonderful melange of sexual humour, pop culture banter and brilliant one liners perfectly benefiting such talented players. Character actor Alan Tudyk is also a scream as Heigl's fitness obsessed boss, and Apatow's tongue in cheek celebrity buddy cameos (including James Franco, Steve Carell and Jessica Alba) raise many a chuckle. <br/><br/>While at two hours and ten minutes, the film does feel about 10-20 minutes too long, the plot begins to repeat itself before the end and certainly doesn't shirk from unabashedly clichÃ©ed moments and an unrealistically upbeat ending, it's near impossible to imagine or even want such a film to end on a different note. But such criticisms pale in the face of such an undeniably impressive work - for the first time, Apatow has made his brand of humour accessible to a far wider demographic, contrary to whatever reacting might be evoked by the film's title. Providing both the (no pun intended) belly laughs one would expect from such a film, and brilliant human introspection, all filtered through the rambunctious and filthy comedic lens of today, Knocked Up hits all the right notes -a surprisingly touching, undeniably realistic and thoroughly entertaining take on ""growing up"" and accepting responsibility. <br/><br/>-9/10"

"jellyneckr","Null","11","24","15 June 2007"," Most overrated of the year
","It seems that I was one of the people in America who did not enjoy The 40 Year Old Virgin, popular comedy writer Judd Apatow's directorial film debut that launched the film careers of stars Steve Carell and Seth Rogen. There were some chuckles in it for sure, but I found it to be too long and meandering in tone. The best part of 'Virgin' was co-star Rogen who definitely upstaged Carell. With Rogen in the starring role this time around, I decided to give Knocked Up a shot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the results are similar to that of 'Virgin'. Rogen is hysterical, it's the rest of the picture that's the problem. From an incredibly predictable script to questionable direction, Knocked Up is surprisingly less enjoyable than Apatow's previous effort. However, it does suffer from his debut's biggest problems: tone and length. I don't know what makes Apatow think comedies should be required to be over two hours, though he needs to become more familiar with the process of editing. Every scene goes on at least 30 seconds longer than they should. Whether a scene is relevant to the plot or not, it becomes such a point of excess that I half expected credits at the bottom of the screen to appear and say ""this is a joke, laugh now"" or ""make sure you took in what this character is saying."" It doesn't help that the tone is all over the place. The switches between comedy and drama are jarring. Rogen actually handles himself quite well with the dramatic material, its love interest Katherine Heigl who isn't always convincing when she needs to be. Heigl is a good actress when given the right material, she just seems out of place here. To be fair, her character isn't very well written. Neither are the roommates in the picture. The roommates are all one-dimensional stoners that get all the best lines yet little character development. Anyone expecting well-rounded characters is advised to see something else. In fact, anyone expecting anything of actual quality is advised to see something else. Without Rogen, Knocked Up would be more painful than child birth. 2/10"

The movie had no identity.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure how to handle the characters. Was I supposed to identify with them and take them seriously? Or was I supposed to laugh at how goofy they were? There was a little bit of both, but because of that I was never really able to get into the groove of it. In this case two halves did NOT make a whole.<br/><br/>Sure, it was good for a few laughs, the acting was fine (not outstanding), the production was fine (again, not outstanding)...but I don't think it was worth seeing in the theaters. It just left me in limbo...I couldn't really get into the comedy because these were SERIOUS issues they explored, and I also couldn't take the characters and their problems as seriously as I wanted to because of the wacky 40 YOV humor. Knocked Up tried to be two things at once, and because of that it lost lots of power on both sides of the coin.<br/><br/>Maybe people like this new kind of ""half comedy""...but I couldn't really get into it. And it just seemed to drag ON AND ON. Especially because from what I heard there was supposed to be constant gut busting humor...but to be honest, I don't think this is nearly as good as 40 YOV, because it takes itself too seriously. You knew what 40 YOV was from the start, right up the goofy song ending...they kept you in that comedy mode. But Knocked Up seemed to get caught in no man's land to me...and just couldn't satisfy either my want for comedy or my want for romance/drama.<br/><br/>Overall it's not a bad film, but I'd wait for it on DVD and a lazy, rainy day :)"

Her sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann) is glad to help out, so the two of the them get dolled up and head for a trendy nightclub. Once there, Allison goes to the bar to buy some drinks but she has difficulty attracting the bartender's attention. Enter Ben (Seth Rogen). He helps Allison by arranging for her to get her beers without delay. Allsion is grateful and heads back to her table. Ben also returns to his circle of friends, where his pals chide him for not making more of a play for the obviously beautiful Allison. Bolstered by their suggestions, he approaches Allison again and they make a connection, albeit one that works better because of Allison's growing intoxication. They somehow end up spending the night together. But, in the morning, reality rears its ugly face. Allsion is a pretty lady with a great job and Ben is a consummate slacker with no ambitions or desire to change his present circumstances. Although they go their separate ways, fate throws them a curveball. Eight weeks later, Allsion learns that she is pregnant. Is there any possible future for Allison and Ben, that includes a baby? This is a very funny film, although the humor is as eyebrow-raising as it comes. The cast, quite large, is very nice, with Rogen doing a great job as the less-than-perfect suitor for Allison. Special mention should also be extended to Paul Rudd for his simply tremendous performance as Debbie's husband, a performance of humor and empathy. The whole production looks great, with well-picked costumes, scenery, and photography. Again, the script is the true champion here, as the story shines a bright, probing light on the realities of marriage, casual sex, money, and success. Although one would have to say, in the final analysis, that the film's conclusion is unrealistic, it is a very upbeat one, indeed. In essence, this is the brave new world of romantic comedy, told from the male perspective, as exhibited in such films as The 40 Year Old Virgin. As such, it is supremely funny and insightful but, if you prefer fun that is good and clean, you should pick another film, for this one treads into the limits of raunchiness."

","I give it a 3 instead of a 0 because taken out of context there were some good jokes and signs of intelligence.<br/><br/>Given the hype, I expected to laugh. I laughed like crazy thru Borat, Austin Powers movies, and other genuine comedies, but this movie was way disappointing for the following reasons, in order of importance:<br/><br/>1. Implausible plot hinge -- no way would drop-dead gorgeous and high profile Alison keep the baby given Seth and his ridiculously comical slacker profile. How did this get past everyone involved in the film, from conception (pun intended)onward? Surely this was a nagging concern through script development and through actual filming, and it is essentially a death sentence for this film in terms of longevity in artistic merit (box office I don't care). I basically just watched the film for technical reasons after this fatal mistake. People who live in LA most of all should know that her decision to keep the pregnancy is absurd. It just doesn't make sense. They could have at least made her Mormon or Catholic or whatever, thrown in something that made it ""impossible"" socially, or morally, to have an abortion, but they went ahead with her just ""wanting to keep the baby"". What universe are critics living in? <br/><br/>2. Gratuitous profanity. Unfricken believable. Ha ha. Especially where he cusses out the doctor for being at a bar mitzvah in SF when he really should be in LA (where way too many of these films are conveniently made)...and people thought that was funny? And the film-maker having his own 8 year-old-daughter say ""Everyone calls you a prick. What's a prick?"" I am politically progressive. I also have a 7 year old daughter. I cringed when I saw that, in the context of the whole movie. Does that make me an old fart? <br/><br/>3. Cypher / cartoonish / cardboard-cutout / stereotypical characters. Nobody is really like those characters that Seth hangs out with (See implausible). Don't get me wrong. A movie can be implausible, in the sense that one suspends belief for some Deus ex machina type of trick (the existence of angels or Santa Claus) -- but the movie must flow off of that plausibly...the trouble with this film, is that there was NO reason that anyone with any intelligence would believe a woman deciding, with pseudo womanly emotions, to keep a baby fathered by this Seth guy. Or that Alison's sister would find Seth ""OK"". Or a lot of other things. <br/><br/>4. It presents itself as a romantic comedy, but it's really a tween film, appealing to ""sophisticated"" 12-17 year old boys who legally aren't supposed to be seeing it, because of the R rating. Huh? Am I clueless to the hundreds of thousands of tween-mented grownups in this country?<br/><br/>I live 600 miles north of Los Angeles. Perhaps as a garden variety citizen who loves a good movie but does not ""live and breathe"" them as apparently quite a few people do, I have failed to appreciate the special quality of this tree; but I would say no, that those who think this is a good movie are failing to see the health of the forest. They're so focused on the ""laughs"" for laughs sake, or the comic timing, or the editing technique, or simply comparing the film to other films, that they forget what movies are supposed to do.<br/><br/>Finally, I really wanted to like the movie, and was looking forward to it, since romantic comedies are so hard to do well. But if this is what critics are hailing, we are in really desperate times in this country."

However, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd and the fat roommate characters with the penchant for F-bombs are gratingly annoying -- so irritating they should be beaten up for scratching the chalk board with fingernails in terms of poor acting -- their grade school acting which prove this movie feeds on lowest common denominator mentality with infantile attitude and mindless profanity. The culprit is easy: Judd Apatow, deluded to believe that the more vulgar, the funnier it is. Quite the contrary. I'm not even a prude and I found ""Very Bad Things"" & ""Smokin' Ace"" hysterically funny. <br/><br/>However, the point is, Judd Apatow writes so many throw-away jokes it gets boring, so he resorts to appallingly cruel jokes (xenophobic & sexist among other sacrileges) later in the movie. It's my deduction Judd is a depraved man with deep issues. What did Stephen Hawking do that compelled Mr. Apatow to write a shameless joke on his personal life and deriding achievement in advancing human knowledge? Mr. Apatow's mentality, like that of equally vicious & self-important comedians Sarah Silverman and Carlos Mencia ( George Carlin gets the pass because he's a genius without being needlessly malicious and cruel), may be childish, though it could be that he exhibits the characteristic trait of ""Peter Pan syndrome"" in slacker male characters, with which I might concur as I've had past roommates like that. Hollywood have proved it still deliver consistent quantity of trash for box office dollars sacrificing decency for cheap & vulgar preference. No wonder why parts of the world, particularly the Middle East outside of Israel, despise Hollywood in peddling propagandistic filth to condition North American audiences to accept the vulgar attitude and lifestyle. <br/><br/>Why did Harold Ramis, the talented co-writer/actor in Ghostbuster movies and director of Groundhog Day, agree to a cameo in this movie? And why did Bennett Miller, who directed the well-made true crime debut movie Capote, agree to visit the set and tag along with the insanely profane Judd Apatow? (I saw ""Directing the Director"" extra and wasn't sure if it's an inside joke as the ending is obvious) Mind boggles.<br/><br/>The ending credit with the photo gallery of the cast and crew members as real-life parents border on saccharinity for emotional manipulation, in light of the amazingly vulgar content of the movie. I find this hilariously ironic. Maybe exalting the distribution and production of child pornography should become an acceptable norm in future Hollywood productions to demonstrate the amoral perception of Hollywood producers.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" is so pointlessly profane, lame, unfunny and treacly it's one of the few movies I had to take two ibuprofen pills afterwards. The ending in The 40-Year-Old Virgin was horrifically lame and contrived; Knocked Up is worse throughout. Don't bothering wasting a phony 3-dollar bill renting this despicably raunchy movie, it's more like primetime Cinemax/Showtime comedy variety that emphasize excessive vulgarity over quality.<br/><br/>Simply put, Judd Apatow is a hack of comedy genre like Michael Bay is a hack of the action genre.<br/><br/>* out of four"

","this movie was way lame. LAME LAME LAME. Drugs, sex, horrible language. I felt like this movie was so unbearably vulgar and putrid that I had to go watch a children's movie after wards to cleanse myself. I know movies are not reality and go over the top but come on, is there no limit AT ALL! who the hell acts like these people? a group of stoners who sit around on the internet trying to find topless women (basically porn) non stop as their ""job"" *cough* and take hits off a bong? the word loser needs to be multiplied by ten and then whatever that word equals, are these guys. it is painful to event think of people living a life like that. How is this possibly funny? what was kathryn heigl doing there? This is societies worst nightmare to think that people are like this or can turn into this. So I believe this should have been in the ""horror"" category minoring in soft-porn. Whats with all the boobs? Honestly, are these grown male producers not able to make one single R rated comedy without the typical topless scene? go buy a playboy for gods sake and spare the females in the audience (there are women that like to watch movies too) waste of time and money. This movie is disgusting and because of this movie IMDb should offer a below 0/negative category. F-"
"jzappa","8","7","14","2 March 2008"," Plays the Consumerism Game and Releases Astute Communication
","Knocked Up did its applaudably, insightfully wise job. It lured its conventional teen target consumers into a hard-to-miss universal social commentary. It is stunningly enlightening and intelligent, not in a vernacular or high-brow sense but emboldeningly sharp in its assertion of wisdom and sensibility within the mainstream American culture of regular pop culture-driven people of today.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow is so honest and wise in his portrayal of the all-American knocked-up situation, that everything makes sense despite how stupid things are. Take for example the most obvious and necessary scene in the movie, which is when Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl get drunk and wind up at her house having sex. Rogen is battling to maintain an erection and fit a condom on while keeping the pace. Heigl gets impatient and says, ""Just do it!"" Of course, she's trying to speed up the fastening of the condom. But also of course, he interprets that as ""Forget the condom, let's go."" This clearly pivotal moment in the movie could so easily have been botched.<br/><br/>Apatow is very much above the stick figure story. See, a lot of the time when Hollywood wants to make a commercial movie with a message pertaining to an oft-confronted conflict in or because of American culture, they simply take a classic scenario and fill in the blanks, which would just be character names, place, et cetera. Knocked Up begins with its characters. It also sets the stage for hilarity at their expense. Rogen is not just a horny American Pie party animal. He's an immature Jewish Canadian who is building a website of all the great nudie film scenes with his LA pothead friends. He lives there and doesn't pay taxes, living on an injury settlement. Heigl is a competent, together, motivated woman who is promoted anchorwoman for E! TV and lives with her sister, who is married with a family. She goes to a nightclub because she is rewarding herself with a good time and he goes to the same nightclub because he and his friends spontaneously decided to go. This pairing is an extremely socially and psychologically perceptive comic manipulation. Their occupations and immediate social personalities are specifically and deeply opposing.<br/><br/>It's not just a farce, however. It takes itself seriously. Seth Rogen's character's personality is actually a good model for describing the climate of the film. It's hilarious with a whip-smart sense of timing and comeback, yet it isn't simply a breezy clown because there's so much aggression and passion behind it's sense of humor. This leaves room for the most comfortable and considerate poignancy in a Hollywood movie directed at young people in years. All of the couple's fears and mutually irritating idiosyncracies naturally threaten the delicate situation that they try so hard to take with a grain of salt, and their own friends and family become infected with the same feelings between each other. Heigl's sister, played by Leslie Mann, is in the most typical hetero marriage in the world: an unhappy one. And because of their close sibling relationship, their instabilities and uncertainties complement each other.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen are hilarious together and Jonah Hill, whose natural over- the-topness works well in the subsequent Apatow/Rogen film Superbad, here playing one of Rogen's stoner friends, whips out many a razor-sharp laugh line. The dialogue in this film is so absorbing, hilarious, smart, rhythmic and quotable that David Mamet, Quentin Tarantino, Neil Simon, and Dashiell Hammett are surely seeking to visit Apatow for inspiration. No, I wouldn't rank Knocked Up with the likes of Glengarry Glen Ross, Pulp Fiction, The Goodbye Girl or To Have and Have Not, but it's certainly the cinematic speech beat for the present American pop culture. It has its fingers vigorously pressing against its pulse.<br/><br/>I know I'm building this film up a wee bit, and I should in all fairness report that the movie struggles to begin. The first five minutes or so strike dread into one's heart because the rap blaring over the soundtrack, the shots of Rogen and his buddies partying, and Heigl's existing-condition life look like one's in for a simple coasting through Hollywood 16-to-25 age group fluff. Nevertheless it certainly overpowers its brief early expectation by a landslide."

","The point to this movie is that, no matter how disgusting and unredeeming you are, if you knock up a pretty girl, she can't help but fall in love with you. Which makes this the perfect date movie for today's youth mentality.<br/><br/>There really was no connection between Heigl's ""I find you disgusting"" to her ""I love you, too"" except for the pregnancy. If this movie had made just one bit of transition material between the two polar extremes, it might have made it almost believable.<br/><br/>There were a couple of chuckles in it, Heigl is lovely; Ben didn't know whether to be a lovable teddy bear or a junkie. It really suffers from lax editing -- were the editors smoking weed while they did it? -- trim an hour from this film and you might have something.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Too little comedy; too little relationships; too long a movie."

","This movie was a huge disappointment. Are we to believe that a beautiful, successful woman like Alison would ever give the time of day to someone like Ben? Ben was portrayed as the biggest loser of all time; fat, lazy, broke, immature, crude, perverted, and lest we forget...arrogant despite these shortcomings! Why would she be attracted to him? Why would she attempt to have a relationship with him, even if she was carrying his child? She'd be better off as a single parent! This is the problem I had with this movie. I found Ben to be such a heinous sleaze-ball and for the life of me could not understand Alison's reason for keeping him around. What happened to chivalry? I would have loved to see Ben die in a fiery car wreck. A grenade through his window, detonating right in his fat face, would have also sufficed. As long as that grenade took out his worthless friends too."

","This film was totally unfunny, crude and vulgar. It would have been half as long if the scriptwriters had taken out all the swearing. Most scenes had Seth swearing or both of the women screeching and swearing, both of which was totally unnecessary. The situation could have been handled with humour but the way it was handled in this film was gross. Why did his friends need to have pink eye, it was obviously so they could make a crude joke. I am amazed that an actor of Paul Rudd's ability signed up to be in this childish rubbish. If this is what Hollywood decides the audience wants to see then it is a shame. It aims at the lowest common denominator and I don't think that I will bother to see anything that has Seth's name on it again."

","I had just watched Knocked Up last night and it turned out to be the funniest and most original comedy I've seen since The 40 Year Old Virgin last year. Seth Rogen, was absolutely hilarious as Ben Stone a fun loving party animal who meets successful career girl Alison (Heigl) at a bar they have a drunken one night stand. Two months later she makes the discovery that she's pregnant and for the sake of the baby they try to make a relationship work. It was painfully funny watching a man go from being a party animal to a mature and reliable adult, there was a bit too much drug usage and more sex scenes than in the average comedy. Other than that the movie was pretty entertaining and sweet, seeing two people trying to be together despite the many differences each one has. This story has it's dramatic moments but turns out to be a truly heartwarming story."

","KNOCKED UP 2007 (SETH ROGEN, KATHERINE HEIGL, PAUL RUDD) DIRECTED BY: JUDD APATOW ~ THE RUNDOWN: A generally distasteful comedy; 'Knocked Up' is too long, too unsuccessfully sentimental and the jokes are usually annoying, one-dimensional smart ass jokes...minus the smart. ~ You know when you're at dinner, or at a party or somewhere where people are talking and suddenly you get that strange, annoyed feeling when a couple idiots you may or may not know start quoting unfunny movie scenes line-by-line and arrogantly laughing at jokes nobody but the two of them find hilarious? Well, whether you realize it or not, 'Knocked Up' will probably leave you with that feeling. But don't worry, you're not a jackass for not jumping on the bandwagon. Here, Apatow's 'Freaks and Geeks' crowd seems to have a lot more fun than the alienated audience most of the time in this tedious, sad excuse for the '40 year old Virgin'. It's true, Apatow has shown nothing but brilliance in the past (huge Heavyweights fan...'Virgin','Freaks and Geeks','Dick and Jane'), but there's no doubt about it - he stumbles here when his usually dead-on, slightly satiric and easy-to-relate-to humor doesn't satisfy. Also, when was porn funny? Personally, I love porn. I am pro-porn all the way. But, Apatow, you need to check yo self...comedies aren't meant for epic proportions with running lengths exceeding two hours and intricately shot sex scenes. The critics may be falling for this stylized comedy sh i t, but you're not getting any brownie points from me. As for the acting: Rogen is good and kicks ass as a leading man, although I think it's safe to say he didn't have to do too much Deniro Method Acting for the role. Heigl was also good and convincing, as well as Starr, Segel and the rest of those guys. I gotta say though, Leslie Mann's crying was awful. I'm not a stickler when it comes to acting but she sucked and made a mockery of her scenes. Paul Rudd was pretty sh**ty too. Their performances were very predictable and, for me, didn't help to communicate any of the bs sentimentality. In fact, at times I felt like I was watching portions of a bad sitcom."
"blanbrn","9","8","17","1 June 2007"," Great movie. Funny, sexy, and raunchy. Judd Apatow again scores big by pushing the limits.
","I must say ""Knocked Up"" is great! It's very funny, sexy, and just great a movie that's a current pop culture gem. Again writer,and director Judd Apatow scores big just like he did with ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", this tale just might be a little more sentimental since it involves childbirth. The script he does is very raunchy and funny with plenty of wise jokes and foul language to keep you amused while an uncommon couple grow during change. You have a loser and porn loving movie and internet slob named Ben(Seth Rogen)who does plenty of pot smoking and childish things, but finally he gets a break when he meets a young and beautiful career-girl named Alison(Katherine Heigl) who's a studio worker at E! News and she finally gets a hosting gig due to her looks and beauty. Upon getting together at the bar one night as so common a one night stand happens! Upon returning to her home which Alison shares with her sister Debbie(Leslie Mann) and her husband Pete(Paul Rudd) she finds out eventually she's knocked up! The news is delivered and both are at first unhappy, but both Ben and Alison decide that they will work together and have the baby and raise it! During the course Apatow fills it with plenty of crude and foul language and raunchy scenes of sex(the two most memorable are the dog style bed scene and the showing of the vagina before birth!) And upon seeing Ben's friends a viewer can feel that they are socially challenged losers, yet with the skin and raunchy scenes Judd did it gives great appeal to hormone driven males. Still if you as a viewer can overlook all of the foul and nagging crudeness underneath you can see this film is a nice fairy tale and storybook love story for both Ben and Alison. For one Ben learns to grow up and learn love and respect the responsibility of a new life. Alison sees life for a change and learns that people are who they are in life just like Ben is and she sees love is possible and can happen between two opposites of their kind. The lines are sharp too with a good take on current pop culture, that helps the viewer find some fresh air as it serves up the start of a new life and brings happiness to a couple of different backgrounds. Overall ""Knocked Up"" is a real winner that's blended well with elements we all like and they make us happy, it proves again that Judd Apatow knows how to reach an audience's emotions and pleasures. Final note it's clear too that Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen are rising stars to be respected look for both to be around some more."

I like to tell jokes and hear friends laugh. Once I met a man that was SO smart that he could always anticipate the ending. Being so smart the poor fellow never laughed at a joke. There must be various degrees of this smartness to laughter ratio as many, perhaps even most of the reviews for Knocked Up (KU) found this movie funny. The reviews that hated KU focused on the extreme use of language (mostly the fork word but with a u not an o).

The only saving grace was Katherine Heigl's character and her family, who made for the best scenes in the movie (though most of those were still nothing to write home about). The male lead and his friends were such despicable, immature human beings that one could not possibly sympathize with them.

My friend and I saw it yesterday and we had an absolute blast. But I have to admit, there were a few jokes that had me a little thrown off or were a little too much, but I have to say that thinking about it, it did over all work because it was realistic. I think we all know someone who is like a character in this film and that was what made it lovable.<br/><br/>Ben Stone is a pot head who is very lazy and is about to put a website up with his friends on how long celebrities are naked in their films.

They have sex and Alison gets pregnant, she tells Ben, and they now are trying to get to know each other and pushing themselves to even love each other for the sake of this child.<br/><br/>Knocked Up has great jokes that anyone I'm sure sometime in your life could relate too. Every character is sympathetic because you could relate in some way. The story worked very well, because sadly, I'm sure this situation happens more than we'd like to think it does.

The guy decides, despite what money he has, to be a father to the kid, beautiful but clichéd. Nevertheless, there was one or two decent jokes, not much to laugh at, and the birth scene sounded more like someone getting stabbed with an axe, followed by that chick-flick sentiment in the end.

Believe me, NO women gets drunk enough to sleep with Seth Rogin. Although I found a lot of laughs in the movie, I also thought the use of vulgarities to be excessive and offensive. It's sort of like when you go see a stand-up comedian live, you know right away if he's got great material by not only the laughs he receives but also the number of curse words he uses, i.e., if he has to use a lot of curse words it means he probably depends on the words to prop up an otherwise humorless routine."

","Knocked Up - A fun-loving slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) has a one night stand with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and they decide to keep the baby and strike up a relationship from there.<br/><br/>The acting in this is solid, the stand-outs being the two 40 Year Old Virgin veterans Rogen and Paul Rudd, who looked like they had a blast making this film. Katherine Heigl brings them down to earth in a part that in a lesser actress' hands would be annoying. My one real complaint would be that at times the comraderie between the Seth and his buddies felt a little forced, unlike thhe group in Virgin.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow is quickly rising through the ranks as one of my favorite comedy directors (Up there under Edgar Wright) and like The 40 Year Old Virgin, this film takes a long-shot premise (In reality, w/e your views on choice or not, this would easily end in an abortion) and runs with it in a more or less serious fashion, though there'd be less hilarity and far fewer movie references in a truly straight-forward version of this tale. If nothing good has come out of Spider-Man 3, at least this film got some good material out of it. And I don't ever recall seeing a better Robert De Nero or Arnold Schwarzennegger impression before. James Franco, Jessica Alba, Alan Tudyk and Steve Carrell (looking as uncomfortable about his Evan Almighty film as I am) all make cameo appearances.<br/><br/>Of course, movie references aside (There's one every 5 minutes or so), this movie is hilarious, and while there aren't that many laugh you to tears moments, the general feeling I had was glee. Rarely a minute goes by without something to make you at least smile, if not laugh out loud.<br/><br/>Humorous antics (and lo, there are many. From drugs to boffing to Cirque du Soleil, these guys can have fun with anything) aside, this is a coming of age story. These are some real characters that go with the funniness.<br/><br/>The main characters are very sympathetic, with the possible exception of Debbie from time to time. I felt she was rather cold sometimes. The movie makes sport several times of marital fights (emotion driven and pointless) and whether or not the women in the audience mind this or not, I don't know. Movie Mom gave this film a B- so I cannot make any claims as to whether the women like this film or not, but this film is one I'd definitely recommend to the guys.<br/><br/>Comedies are hard for me to give a final judgment on because the mark of a very good one is how many times you watch it afterward. I gave The 40 Year Old Virgin a B+ originally and it's become one of my all time favorite comedies. For now, I give Knocked Up an B+"

I like the quirky quasi-ad-libbed style; it worked in The 40 Y.O.V., e.g. the donkey in Tijuana conversation. The problem is that this entire movie is scripted (or not) this way.

","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is a slacker who represents many of the problems with society today yet somehow he's supposed to be a good, sensitive guy. He has sex with a drunk Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), impregnating her and putting the narrative proper into motion. His only means of support for the baby are a get rich quick scheme. This scheme is a website that tells its patrons what part of a movie naked women are in. Even with this disgusting idea, he bullies the aesthetics of others by putting down Steely Dan to his pal Pete (Paul Rudd). Writer and Director Judd Apatow might get male bonding between Ben and his friends as well as Pete and Ben right, but the female characters are treated less equitably. Alison's girlfriend Debbie (Leslie Mann) is portrayed as a controlling bitch and Ben tells her to get out of the room after arriving late to his baby's birth. Even Heigl criticized the film for its taut misogyny. Pete points out late in the movie that marriage is like ""a long episode of Everybody Loves Raymond, except without all the pissy dialogue."" Speak for yourself Apatow. For those of us who didn't grow up on TV, this is simplistic drivel. As is the rest of the movie."

Astonishingly, Alison decides to try and make it work with Ben despite having zilch in common, for their baby's sake.<br/><br/>Rogen plays his character well, with no insecurity and with a wicked amount of confidence playing Heigl's unlikely beau. The kids who play Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Pete's (Paul Rudd) children are Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow's (the director) real children, and they are incredibly charming and deliver their lines without any annoying trace of self-consciousness.<br/><br/>While Knocked Up is marketed as a comedy grossfest, it is surprisingly also much more.

","I've heard quite a bit of buzz about this film, and I have some affection for writer/director Apatow's previous works, so I was reasonably (though cautiously) optimistic about this heavy-handed pregnancy farce. Sadly, it's only about 2/3 of a good movie. After setting the audience up with some pretty raucous humor and a pleasingly cynical sensibility, the film eventually betrays the audience and degenerates into sugar-coated romantic comedy tripe of the foulest kind. I kept expecting or hoping for some kind of surprise, something or anything to pay off on the promise of some of the early parts of the film that were amusing.<br/><br/>I've seen the press reports hailing Seth Rogen as a ""breakout"" comedy star because of this film. But I felt no real star quality around him at all. He's still just an amusing side character, not someone who you can really accept as the focus of an entire film. His character should be likable in an obnoxious kind of way but eventually he just becomes annoying. He can make us laugh, sure -- as when he tosses toys at the kids to get them to ""fetch"" -- but it's really Katherine Heigl's reactions that make it funny for the most part. Not the stuff that stars are made of, but it wouldn't surprise me to see Heigl become sort of a new Cameron Diaz. She's got the necessary looks and she has the star presence, which in the case of this film -- coupled with Leslie Mann's solid turn as her paranoid married sister -- makes Rogen and Paul Rudd's weary ""man show"" type performances feel pretty tired.<br/><br/>Not really worth seeking out, maybe worth a laugh or two on late night cable at some point."
"annetoronto","1","5","10","24 June 2007"," Not funny
","I was disappointed, expecting comedy, not tragedy and a few funny lines. Dialogue was mostly one word ... the F word. Toilet words as a script are only humour for diaper-age boys. ""I love you"" from a man and woman both does not make a romance. Just because the ""heroine"" is beautiful, and the ""nice guy"" ""hero"" says so, does not make a plot line. One line resonated especially well, because when I was a little girl, I also got caught not knowing what a ""prick"" was, so one point for realism, and how little life has changed in half a century. Good is how minor characters are fleshed out and developed. For example, the jealous co-worker who wants dozens of pounds off gave me giggles and doesn't triumph over our naive heroine. Even though the ""happy ending"" is steady job, early to bed, adult living space (and rent?), and presumably less drugs and more taxes, marriage is tentative, the ""square"" husband even provides illegal mushrooms and so the ""laid-back"" lifestyle is idealized overall."

","Even the lowest brow films reward if you allow yourself to watch the machinery of the thing as well as the thing itself. <br/><br/>The narrative itself is unrewarding. The humor is weak, the romance ineffective. But what the thing actually is charms.<br/><br/>A standard romance has the wonderful girl, the clumsy guy who gets the girl, loses the girl by some complication, and then gets her back, usually involving some public, folded activity. These things are billed as date movies and have highly evolved values for both men and women.<br/><br/>The woman's stuff is usually handled by making the guy solidly desirable at root, and supplementing that with some truth about the internals of a woman's life. But the formula is so worn out that studios put heavy attention into innovations that tap the same energy and use the same bankable conventions, but in new ways.<br/><br/>So here we have a new twist on the woman's angle. Oh, it has something for the guys, who apparently can be appeased by a few jokes about how doofy we are. The fact that so little will carry us while other complicated narrative dynamics are spun, says more about how doofy we are than the truth of any joke.<br/><br/>Those complicated dynamics have to do with the girl-to-girl conversation about the world they have to tolerate. By that I mean the wall of incompetence they face in emotional support. So this is a romance with a loser but its okay because all men are losers.<br/><br/>Interestingly, it works. It works better than I would have expected, and that's trying to see it from both sides.<br/><br/>Its a clever experiment perhaps two steps closer to defusing the fantasy of the genre is a self-critical fashion.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

"Jonny_Numb","3","7","16","6 July 2007"," ""Knocked Up"" and out...of 2 hours I'll never get back
","I feel it is my duty as a proactive thinker and cinema fan to level some serious complaints against the unfunny, un-moving, un-touching, un-realistic farce of a farce called ""Knocked Up."" I know film does not need a basis in realism, but when critics hail a film for its sense of 'accuracy' in real-life terms, I carry a whisper of that with me into the theater, whether it is comedy, drama, horror, or avant-garde surrealism. That ""Knocked Up"" has a 92% 'fresh' rating at RottenTomatoes implies one of two things: 1) that film critics need to leave their homes/apartments once in a while and experience life outside the vicarious lens of cinema; or 2) that said critics, in their bubble of maintaining a bar by which the public sets their tastes by, are very out-of-touch with humor derived from real-life situations (a possible 3) is that the other summer comedy offerings are simply so bottom-of-the-barrel that this looks brilliant by comparison).<br/><br/>Or perhaps it's because writer/director Judd Apatow is just so ""hot"" right now--hey, he made ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (which I loved, by the way), and ""Knocked Up"" can only be as good, if not better! Right?!? Well, NO. ""Virgin"" was not a solitary Apatow effort; in the co-writer's chair was the very funny and talented Steve Carrel (who has successfully picked up the Comedy Crown once held by James Carrey), and after seeing ""Knocked Up,"" you can almost tell where the Apatow/Carrel script gradations occur (Apatow: the bar/pick-up scenes; Carrel: the whole of Andy Stitzer). ""Virgin"" had a strong anchor in Carrel, who also hit the right notes of depression, anxiety, joy, and sarcasm in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" In ""Knocked,"" Seth Rogen (a funny supporting character in ""Virgin"") shows no leading-man quality, even in the 'unlikely' way the film laboriously sets up; Katherine Heigl, the E! producer (yeah, very realistic, isn't it) to whom he does the titular deed, brings nothing exceptional out of his character, since her character is also a shallow, contrived cliché (and certainly acted as one).<br/><br/>Like an extended sitcom (Apatow worked in television before becoming a Hollywood hitmaker), ""Knocked Up"" writhes in textbook stereotypes, clichés, and generalizations. As other critics have keenly pointed out, Heigl's 'attraction' to Rogen is a Screen writing 101 contrivance, and the film ultimately gives us no satisfactory justification for this relationship (of course, the film progresses under the 'realistic' pretense that we should not care about such unimportant details). Does it even need saying that this unlikely couple will try to make things work, have some arguments, and wind up together as Better People in the end? Countless films with predictable structures have held my interest better than ""Knocked Up,"" through innovations in character, dialog, or simply plot twists.<br/><br/>I kept wondering, as the audience broke out into roars of laughter, if there was something I was missing. For the record, I am a 26-year old, single white male, and I do have a sense of humor. My mind cycled through potential audiences for ""Knocked Up"": married couples, people in long-term relationships, parents, and...potheads. While it is Apatow's clear intent to have me rolling in the aisles with every stale-in-five-years pop-culture reference (of which there are many, camouflaged as 'punchlines' to 'jokes'), I came to the conclusion that, if nothing else, I should be LOLing at Rogen's pathetic roommates. You see, they want to start a website displaying video clips of celebrity nudity (any Howard Stern listener will see this unfunny 'punchline' coming from the get-go)! They all get pink-eye! They make Taliban jokes about a roommate who's agreed to a beard-bet! And, they...smoke lots of pot! In another movie, these gags may have worked, but Apatow's method is to just have the audience gawk, expecting the sheer simple overstatement to elicit impressed guffaws. Tenacious D invoked that type of humor in a more creative and FUNNY way last year, but their movie tanked (explains a lot, doesn't it?).<br/><br/>While I sat waiting for ""Knocked Up"" to unveil some revelation about existence that I was somehow missing, I could only come to one conclusion as the credits began rolling: audiences and critics alike want their 'realistic comedy' coated in an impenetrable layer of super-sweet sitcom frosting. Oh, yeah, and for the slob hero to 'change' so he can earn the affections of a girl who looks like Barbie. LMFAO."

","The 40 year old virgin was an instant classic and easily one of the funniest movies I had ever seen.

Well he has, and he has done it quite well.<br/><br/>Knocked Up is a great follow up to his earlier success. In my opinion, it is not as solidly funny as the virgin, but it does come close. Once again, the cast is just so good together that it just seems like you are watching someone's home movie, just filming their friends running around doing goofy things. The chemistry is amazing.<br/><br/>The jokes come fast and often work. There are a few misfires, but way more work than not. The ladies in this film are hilarious. Katherine Heigl does an amazing job as a level headed but semi wild working girl turned hormonally imbalanced pregnant rage of emotions. Leslie Mann practically steals the show, especially the great scene where she gets into it with a doorman at a nightclub.<br/><br/>The support that Rogen and Heigl get is also amazing. All Rogen's roommates play off each other so well, you almost wish they had more screen time. Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen together is comedy gold, especially when they go to vegas.<br/><br/>I could say a million praises to the film, but it's probably not anything you haven't heard already. The movie is over two hours long and never feels that way. It's a great date film with superb acting, a stretched yet believable story, and just loads of fun. Highly recommended."

","The inexplicable premise here is that a pretty and successful young woman chooses to have a one-night stand with an overweight, unemployed, pot-smoking doofus. Not only that, but after becoming pregnant, she wants to spend eternity with this loser. Furthermore, rather than being thankful for having snared a babe who's clearly out of his league, the unattractive slob lashes out at her. Although marketed as a comedy, the film really strives to be a penetrating and touching drama about relationships, but fails miserably due to stereotyped characters and a clichéd plot. Apatow's idea of humor is to insert the f-word into every line of dialog. Comedy or drama, the excessive length makes it drag."

","of all the great reviews I heard about this film when it was in theaters. I thought it was OK, nothing great. I hardly laughed, but it was amusing. Alison is a reporter for the E channel and just got a promotion. So, she celebrates at a club with her sister. Her sister goes home leaving her by her drunk self. She starts chatting up Ben and takes him home. One thing leads to another and 8 weeks later discovers she's knocked up. So, she must contact Ben again. She realizes she is having a child with an overweight, non-working, pot smoking, mid-20 year old loser. But for the sake of the child she decides to get to know Ben and they date. She soon thinks they won't work out because he does drugs, doesn't have a job, etc... But, Ben wants to make it work so shows enthusiasm and wants to make changes.<br/><br/>There is subplot between Alison's sister and her husband. They seem to be a happy couple, but more or less got married because she got pregnant. Allison doesn't want to make the same mistake.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Could have been funnier. Not as good as 40 year old virgin. But check it out if you like adult comedies."
"rhinocerosfive-1","2","3","5","29 November 2007"," Get thee to an abortionist
","Judd Apatow uses a camera as if he's going to study up on the basics tomorrow. He directs actors like barking seals, satisfied if they even partly hit the mark. Every scene screams out for a second take; every other line begs a rewrite; every one of these performers has been better elsewhere. Apatow behaves as if there is no genuine comedy to be mined from the genuinely humorous premises he sets up. Instead, he lectures us that all the world's a sitcom, drowning in schmaltz, clumsiness and bad taste any sympathy I might have had for his characters. ""The Aristocrats"" has a more sophisticated central joke than this piece of crap.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the heroine, an unlikable ditz who thinks working at E! is a good thing. In the course of this film she makes exactly zero decisions that I would call socially responsible. Why, for instance, need I accept the titularly impregnated woman's inexplicable decision to have this baby? The movie offers no credible logic behind her position, like a religious upbringing or a definable philosophy. She is young, hip, sarcastic, apparently a functioning part of her generation, and somehow never once considers the possibility of not giving birth. Apatow tries to skirt the moral issues involved, like the negative social and practical implications of single parenthood, and avoids even the obvious abortion debate, which if nothing else could provide some comic relief to a tedious exercise in mawkishness. I'm not bloodthirsty. I don't have a pro-abortion agenda. But this is a story, and as such it should make some kind of sense. Instead I am given no excuse beyond her tearful statement: ""I want to keep it."" Her tears are understandable, as she just landed what she thinks is a good job, and the father is if anything a less promising parent than herself. So why have it? Nothing in her behavior suggests a particularly moral or even generous, much less maternal, instinct. So Apatow embraces this pregnancy in a void, with no counter-option, and with no real world against which to examine the empty gesture.<br/><br/>And the daddy. Hmm. Aside from the question of his suitability for human husbandry, why should I watch this loser do anything for two hours? He is shallow, sophomoric, rude, unmotivated, uncultivated, and a bore. Granted, there are a few scattered minutes of mildly inspired ""Animal House"" hijinks with his slacker housemates, but these only serve to make his transition to guy-with-pretensions-to-the-middle-class even less believable, and less welcome. I don't mind spending time with idiots, provided they're amusing. John Belushi in ""Animal House,"" Will Farrell in ""Old School,"" Jeremy Piven in ""Very Bad Things,"" are worth hanging out with because they are presented as reprehensible, and more importantly, because these actors had the script and the charisma to make watching them fun. This movie is a celebration of the kind of stupidity booed in ""Idiocracy,"" another film which failed to rise to its premise.<br/><br/>So ultimately, the performers are not the problem here. Kirsten Wiig and Leslie Mann are particularly good. But the whole movie looks like Apatow had something better to do. His plotting and organization bear the hallmarks of chronic short-term memory loss. <br/><br/>Maybe he should make a movie about Alzheimer's. He'd probably call it ""Stoned Age."""
"Soujiro","4","19","58","7 June 2007"," Insultingly ridiculous premise custom-made for the adolescent man.
","As many reviewers have already stated, this movie is based on a premise that is incredibly unbelievable, even for a comedy, even for an Apatow comedy. At least in The 40 Year Old Virgin, you could kind of barely understand the appeal of the main character. Not here. Ben is a little too realistically lame to be funny or sympathetic. The movie shares space in that uncanny valley that ""King of the Hill"" occupies, where you realize with slowly growing horror that thousands of emotionally and intellectually stunted ""men"" like these characters exist. Although the movie makes light fun of their lifestyle, it ultimately excuses and justifies it. And so we reach the crux of the problem: <br/><br/>I don't care how drunk she gets, an intelligent, attractive, successful woman is not going to sleep with Ben, ever, to say nothing of not having an abortion if she were to become impregnated with his loser-spawn. Movies like this are comfort food for teens and man-children who shirk responsibility and spout lazy profanity all day because they have nothing interesting to say. I'm sure that if I were thirteen again, I would find the constant use of the F-word, homophobic jokes, and ""stoned guys think everything is funny"" scenes to be works of comic brilliance, but it all sounds pretty trite to my ancient 29 year old ears.<br/><br/>I liked Mallrats, Austin Powers, even Dodgeball and Zoolander. I have no problems laughing at a low-brow comedy, even profanity if it is used in interesting ways, but screenwriters need to stop insulting the intelligence and judgment of their female characters. If the movie poked fun at its own stupidity with more vigor or provided some meaningful character development, it would be less of an issue, but the tone jerks violently back and forth in a half-hearted effort to shoehorn some kind of life lesson into its ludicrous plot. <br/><br/>The end result of this bipolar sitcomminess is that the target audiences leave with the suspicion that their fruitless, ignorant lives are actually not so bad. After all, a heterosexual relationship with a beautiful woman and the miracle of childbirth are all it takes to turn everything around. Why waste time maturing into a decent, intelligent, tolerant, productive member of society? That's so lame. Just let your brain idle in that adolescent sweet-spot and fantasize about having sex with every attractive woman you see without ever taking the time to actually get to know one. Your penis will work its mysterious magic, and presto! you shall become a man. This is not a helpful message for the already ignorant youth of America.<br/><br/>Even if you thought The Forty Year Old Virgin was a work of genius, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed by this one. However, if you thought Wedding Crashers was hilarious, this will be right up your alley. Of course, if you happen to be a lazy slob with a dead-end job who hangs out all day gaming and getting high with equally brainless companions, maybe this movie will bring you some misguided hope that a wonderful woman you don't deserve will decide to clean up your life for you just because you're so damn irresistible... or maybe you'll be depressed about how ridiculous and unfunny it all is and just want your money back."

","In my opinion, Judd Apatow is an insulting, offensive and demeaning director. I will probably never go see another Judd Apatow movie again. After all of the ""positive"" praise that this movie received, I made the mistake of watching it hoping for a funny and enjoyable movie. Afterwards I was in shock that this movie received any positive praise at all and feel the praise was completely undeserved. I felt so disturbed that people would rate such a degrading, offensive movie so highly, and that objectifying women would be viewed as funny. They didn't even seem to be treated human in this movie, but merely objects...a display of flesh and completely used in a negative way. There was absolutely no signs of intelligence or substance in this movie. The whole time I watched (which I wasn't even able to complete due to being so offended) I was waiting for a one liner or punch line that would make me laugh....nada....nothing....not even a chuckle. I was just thinking, are you serious? this is what people think is funny? Being a woman especially, I was so shocked at the numerous incredibly raw scenes that were supposedly ""humorous"" and just did a jaw drop in disbelief. I was baffled and saddened by this movie. Taking women, making them seem like nothing more than whiney, annoying, pains in the rear, then on top of that making a spectacle of their body was humiliating for me to watch. The directors obviously have no respect for women what so ever, or their bodies. The strip club scene which so many movies seem to have nowadays (so original) was about all I could take before shutting off the movie. A married man who happens to have young daughters rubbing his face in the butt cheeks of a stripper while his buddy gets a motor boat by another stripper who couldn't have possibly had a bigger set of ""jugs"" so they could ""blow off steam"" is hardly funny....its disrespectful and pathetic behavior. If my husband acted like a neandrathal like these guys, he sure as hell wouldn't be married to me. I have a bit more dignity than that and this movie is a perfect example of allowing men to behave in this immature, repulsive, and unacceptable behavior. I mean seriously....the characters are grown men. This movie basically said to me, raunch, disrespect, sexism, insulting, offensive, and any other word similar to those.....and also the message that men never grow up, or learn how to respect females....sad...pathetic movie....horrible horrible horrible....F- I didn't even want to give it a 1, but that was the lowest score possible."

","I had heard so much about this movie that it was nearly impossibly for i to live up the the expectations I had. Some people even called it the funniest movie of all time. It was number 1 at the box office for weeks. It made nearly 150 million dollars. I finally got it from netflix last night and sat down for a viewing. My opinion is that it's a fine movie, but certainly not the funniest movie ever made.<br/><br/>The plot sees simple enough. Slacker goes to a bar and has a one night stand with a stranger. Stranger gets pregnant and they struggle to cope with the situation they're in. The slacker realizes that his partying ways are about to come to an end, and she is terrified that she'll lose her job as an on-air E network personality. The film follows them through the course of her 9 month pregnancy, and introduces us to a zany cast of characters along the way.<br/><br/>For those who have seen the film, perhaps the funniest moment was the cameo of ""Stephen Hawking"" or their constant harassment over a roommate who decided to go a full year without cutting his hair or shaving. A lot of what makes this film work on a personal level is the ability of the audience to identify with the characters. Most people know a slacker, a demanding wife, a husband who will do anything to get out of the house, etc. Watching this film was almost equivalent to going back in time when I was in college (sans the drugs).<br/><br/>Overall, I give this a 7/10. Definitely worth renting, but not as good as the 40 Year Old Virgin."

Without wishing to go into too detailed an analysis as to why this film is simply abhorrent, I would list the three main failings as these<br/><br/>1) the premise is simply not believable; that a woman like this would attempt to form a relationship with such an obvious loser simply because she mistakenly became pregnant with his child.. this isn't stretching credulity, this is akin to asking people to believe the moon is made of cheese..<br/><br/>2) it is impossible to empathise with ANY of the characters (even the children are odious)<br/><br/>3) is this extreme level of profanity truly necessary?

","Any thoughts of Apatow becoming the 2000's version of John Hughes -- several top-flight projects over a short period -- is pretty much officially dead. Sure, the prolific stream of scripts cranked out is there, but the quality? Hoo, man, not even remotely close.<br/><br/>In what seems like his umpteenth telling of a group of one-track minded slacker idiots, we're treated to yet another underdeveloped hero who we'd never associate with in real life. This time it's the candidate for worst new leading man of cinema Rogan and the results of an utterly unlikely one night stand. He spins his wheels, trying to cope with his new predicament, all the while immersing himself as yet another failure to the ""just say no"" program. But let's get to the real issues here...<br/><br/>1. An absolute lack of chemistry between the leads. Heigl is totally unlikable as a one-note, demanding career woman, who garners zero sympathy for her moodswings....and that's before the hormones kick in! And Rogen, if I have to listen to that stoned-out, grating cackle of his one more time, I'll beg for my death.<br/><br/>2. The supporting couple who annoy even more, Mann as an unbearable whine-machine, and Rudd in another one his sleep-walking roles as a hapless guru of life (who sneaks off to fantasy baseball meetings?? What in the living hell???).<br/><br/>3. People complimenting Apatow's ability to touch on ""those sensitive and telling true-to-life comments about marriage and children"". Uhhh, when a majority of the characters are portrayed as not even slightly lovable, the pithy ruminations on their lives come off as false and unaffecting. Are these people you'd really want to spend one hour with??<br/><br/>3. A tired, tired, TIRED screenplay approach where F-bombs and female anatomy discussions that seem so painfully forced, not containing a shred of reality to them.<br/><br/>4. And the frigging ENDLESS pop culture references that just magnify that absence of creativity at the screenplay level. I watch movies to live through the lives of the characters, NOT to listen, and listen, and listen ad naseum to their ridiculously stupid amount of movie and music mentions. The infamous comparisons to the bearded buddy character alone were enough to elicit groans and a swirling head from me.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what made Freaks and Geeks so good to Apatow, is what's killing his film work: the freedom and ability to rely *strictly* on near NC-17, bodily and gross-out humor. The restraints of television actually caused him to -- gasp! -- write competently and engagingly. But after the ""Anchormans"" and ""Virgins"" and now this slop (plus the fact those and this were hits) sadly signals a trend he'll probably leave on his tombstone."

I think one of the problems I had was the fact I could not relate myself to the characters. The burn-out, perverted stoner who seems to have no real connection with the rest of the world. The characters to me are over the top creepy most of the time. The movie gets a little slow at times also, and sometimes it feels like they tried to drag it out so it would seem longer. However, it is a funny movie and a lot of the jokes are good. It is about as funny as 40 Year Old Virgin, but 40 Year Old Virgin is a much better film on the whole. I expect Seth Rogan to be a star for a long time, because he is very good at looking stupid and quirky, which makes the movie better. His blank facial expressions are just great in many scenes. Its not just a horrible film, but its not exactly great. Average is the best word I can use here."

There were some very funny parts and all together I'd say it was a fairly enjoyable film, however after reading all the amazing reviews and hearing all the hype I was expecting a much better movie.<br/><br/>First; I had a lot of trouble buying the story. Two drunk people meet in a bar and hook up I can understand, although those two? Um, not so much. She's a supermodel and he's an overweight stoner loser type. While it MAY happen in the real world; I've never witnessed it. The next morning they're having breakfast and the look on her face when he's talking about bong hits and his lifestyle is enough to send her running to the ""shmashorshin clinic"" immediately. Instead for some undisclosed reason she decides, in spite of the fact that she just got a huge promotion at work that she should have the love child of this guy. I can't imagine her motivation for wanting to go through with this, but be that as it may...So she then meets with him to discuss things and shortly after falls for him and now they're both ""in love"". Again, makes no sense. While I'm sure the prospect of this guy being with a woman like this never occurred to him in his wildest fantasies I don't see him embracing fatherhood as quickly as he did and abandoning his slacker friends and lifestyle. I also felt that a girl like this would have either her glamorous mom or rich sister be appaulled at her being with this guy and having his kid.<br/><br/>That being said; I really liked Seth Rogan. Katherine Heigel is very beautiful, but I found her character boring. Despite the fact that the story as a whole was very hard to believe I did laugh a lot and thought there were some really good moments. One of my favorites was when he called the doctor and threatened to kill him. That was hilarious. I thought it actually quite endearing the way he began to become more supportive as time went on and very protective of her as well."

","This is the second of the Judd Apatow movie's I've seen, the first being ""40 Year Old Virgin""; of the two, this was the more depressing and gut-wrenching of the two. Above all, this movie symbolizes the loss of individuality and freedom for the conformity of married life. The movie was full of too many dramatic, serious moments, and not nearly goofy enough. The raunchy toilet humor was totally out of place in what was an otherwise tragic story.<br/><br/>This movie presents a very grim view of married life and interpersonal relationships between men and women. One feels very sorry for the brother-in-law of the pregnant woman, who only desires some alone time from his nagging, unbearable shrew of a wife; and yet, we're supposed to buy the fact that he's going to crawl back to her as a devoted husband? What's more, Heigl's character is willing to go through with pregnancy with Rogen's irresponsible shlub? The pairing in the movie is one of a cycle of bickering and forgiveness, with no end in sight. The bickering isn't even funny, like the kind you see in ""Married With Children"" or ""War of the Roses""; it's rather creepy, especially with the fact that Rogen's character takes it all in stride and responds with fawning affection. One can smell the train wreck of a relationship that's coming, and it won't be funny in the least.<br/><br/>One can criticize this movie for its theme of a libertine man trading in his life for responsibility and domestic bliss. He is forced into a politically correct mold which gives this film a flavor of the generic and mainstream. Apatow does not seem interested in going against the grain; he is content to please mainstream America with a happily-ever-after of a sappy love story of a fawning husband and his demanding wife. This is not a goofy parody or tongue-in-cheek approach: Apatow is content to shove the idea of Rogen being a ""changed man"" down our gullets, until we see him as following the straight-and-narrow path to pleasing his rather demanding girlfriend.<br/><br/>This movie follows the formula of using toilet humor paradoxically interspliced with mainstream morality. Sure, we may chuckle at stoners giving each other ""pink eye"", or playing murderball in wheelchairs; but that's a given in any mainstream comedy nowadays. This movie dares not even mention the word ""abortion"" by name; even if one is morally opposed to the idea of an abortion, and sees it as evil, the word can at least be mentioned. This seems like an act of cowardice in the scriptwriter's part.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is not goofy or silly enough to warrant a recommendation. It takes its message far too seriously, and presents a view of life between men and women which will make one pine for a bachelor's life forever."

","Ugh...I absolutely detest movies that give the message - ""It's okay to be a slacker as long as you're a nice person ultimately things will be all fine and dandy"". Most romcoms cater to the female fantasy where a man with the killer combination of looks, smarts and riches falls for the girl next door damsel in distress and sweeps her off her feet. This is a romcom catering to men, where a hot, successful woman falls for an ugly, good-for-nothing slacker. Not only am I not in the target audience (I am a woman), but the realization that the movie attempts to manipulate the viewer into liking it (through aforementioned pandering to base male fantasies) makes me hate the movie even more. The jokes are terrible (and I am saying this as someone who can handle crude humor pretty well), acting lame and the plot absolutely unbelievable, except that this movie isn't pitched as a fantasy.

","First of all, it should be noted that the Heigl-Rogen hardly works and there is little chemistry between their characters, which is pretty bad in the first place.<br/><br/>But the most annoying thing is that, like always with Judd Apatow, Knocked Up lasts more than two hours, when clearly there wasn't enough material to do so. Just by reducing the film to a 1h45 cut for example, it would have gained consistency and interest, because the good lines, the interesting passages and the funny scenes are embedded in the mass.<br/><br/>And it's a shame because the potential was there, whether dramatic or comic, but one can't stop wondering why the director persists in not doing more restrictive cuts that would hugely improve his movies."

"ExpendableMan","8","2","3","29 January 2008"," Judd Apatow's crowning glory
","Cinema in the summer of 2007 belonged to Judd Apatow. While audiences everywhere were becoming excited and disappointed in equal measure to the high-profile likes of Spider Man 3 and The Simpsons Movie, Apatow was bringing truly rewarding films to the table in the shape of Knocked Up and Superbad. Of the two, it seems that Knocked Up had the highest expectations surrounding it as early reports of a never-ending laugh-riot began to circulate amidst some ugly controversy regarding the abortion debate. Now the dust has settled, it's still clear that this funny little pregnancy adventure is an excellent film. Crude, foul mouthed and brimming over with pop culture references, it doesn't provide as many big belly laughs as you'd hope but instead provides a warm and intelligent debate on heterosexual relationships that find themselves having to deal with an unexpected third party.<br/><br/>In some respects, Apatow is becoming Kevin Smith's successor - he writes movies that are true to his own experiences which a lot of people will be able to relate to, not to mention returning to the same cast and crew several times over. Stepping up to the plate here is Seth Rogen, best known for scene stealing supporting turns in You, Me and Dupree and Apatow's own 40 Year Old Virgin. He plays 23 year old man child Ben Stone, an unemployed, pot smoking layabout who manages through a combination of alcohol, charm and sheer luck to cop off with TV career girl Alison Scott (Katherine Hiegl) in a nightclub. His intoxicated mix of joy and ""oh thank god it's been a while"" relief however results in a miscommunication regarding birth control and two months later, she contacts him again to let him know she's carrying his child.<br/><br/>From here, the film charts the giddying highs and terrifying lows of pregnancy remarkably well and it is to Apatow's eternal credit that he manages to voice both sex's anxiety in a convincing way. Ben is distraught that his days of booze, pot and porn may be over but simultaneously determined to stand by Alison and be a good father. Alison meanwhile frets about her looks, career and the fact that she might have to end up with a hairy overweight slob for the rest of her life. This is reflected in the form of Pete and Debbie (Paul Rudd and Leslie ""Mrs Apatow"" Mann), a slightly older married couple who provide a snapshot of how Ben and Alison may turn out. This results not only in some revealing insights about modern relationships but also some very funny and touching scenes. Ben and Pete's trip to Las Vegas for instance is terrific, the pair going on a hallucinogen fuelled wander before a freak out in a hotel room that ends in Pete's revelation of his marriage's big picture.<br/><br/>That isn't to say Knocked Up is all sensible observations and witty dialogue though and there are still some big laughs to be had, most of them provided by Ben's stoner flatmates. A lot of the jokes are very smutty, but they support the story rather than drag it down and they are never puerile simply for the point of being puerile. Apatow isn't above shocking audiences though and some of the camera angles in the climactic birth scene are likely to elicit howls of ""I can't believe they filmed that,"" especially from the women among you.<br/><br/>It's a shame then that Knocked Up's reputation was tarnished somewhat by the media as this is neither a pro-life propaganda piece nor a riotous comedy that'll leave you crying with laughter. Just because a film is about pregnancy doesn't mean it has to have an agenda and when it's as sweet, touching and true to life as this one, it's a very pedantic complaint to make. If you want to laugh so much it hurts, go and rent Superbad (trust me, it's awesome) but if you want a romantic comedy that's so good you don't even realise it is one, this is the film to get."

","Wasn't looking forward to this film anyway as I know from the description it's not my kind of thing at all. However, after first 15 minutes was pleasantly surprised and to my horror was quite enjoying it. The main protagonists had a good chemistry in the fact that they're at opposite ends of the spectrum and was funny to see Ben's comments. However, all starts to turn sour with this film once we hit 40-45 minutes. What was once a decent light comedy with a serious side... turns into a dull , predictable rom/com without the com or the rom in fact hahaha... it's literally a dreary hour that somehow just turns into a meadrama and loses ALL interest. Ben and Alison are now just going through the motions and there's no light relief...<br/><br/>In fact I can say I've never been so bored with a film ever, which was a shame as upto 45 minutes, it was certainly a decent 6/10 simply because of some great one liners from Ben... however, it's like the makers have got to the half way point and thought, lets make a serious film? Doesn't work and even though it goes into what I class as simply a ""girly film"" I defy any women to actually find it interesting?"""

","It's every man's worst nightmare: after a one-night stand with a pretty girl you meet at a nightclub, she calls you up six weeks later and tells you she's pregnant and is going to keep the baby. I would imagine that if Knocked Up sent any lesson to its male audience, it would be to give out a fake phone number next time. Just kidding.<br/><br/>This is one of those comedies that was hilarious at the time, but no one has any idea how funny it will be as the years pass. Who knows how funny it will be to laugh at a guy completely unprepared for fatherhood suddenly reading baby books and going shopping for bassinets? Years from now, audiences might wonder why Katherine Heigl wanted Seth Rogen to be an active father figure in her child's life if he was so irresponsible and ill equipped. For now, it's still funny when drunk people think they're good dancers, when doctors have less tact than you'd like, and when bedroom scenes don't go as planned. If you missed this one when it came out, gather up a group of your friends and have a steady stream of cocktails ready. Just don't do what I did: no matter how cool and modern your parents want to prove they are, don't watch this movie with them.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

","'Knocked Up (2007)' is not always particularity funny, though it certainly has its moments, and sometimes crudity or brashness comes from nowhere to an almost deafening effect. Luckily, the feature finds a way to be entertaining and even compelling without needing the audience to be in stitches, thanks mainly to a likeable set of leads and a central situation that is inherently interesting. The plot beats are all hit just when they predictably should be, including a falling out that is a little overwrought and unbelievable, but as conventional as it may be, it's also somewhat endearing and it helps that it never seems overly sentimental thanks to the injections of real humour throughout. 7/10"

"Okonh0wp","7","1","1","29 December 2015"," Modern romance isn't pretty
","I think there's been a general notion recently that, at least among the mainstream demographic, the Romantic comedy is dead. So with that in mind, there's some good news and bad news. The good news is that the genre has been saved by a gifted young writer named Judd Apatow. The bad news: It isn't very pretty.<br/><br/>It's sad but true. His film is crude and does very little to restore confidence to the institution of fatherhood. The PTA in this child's future school district is rightfully going to be frightened to death.<br/><br/>At the same time, ""Knocked Up"" probably comes closer to portraying modern romance more than any attempt at romantic comedy in recent years. As sad as it is to admit, romance these days is more about drunken hook-ups than it is about screwball-comedy-type courting and today's standard of chivalry might be a guy like Rogen's character, willing to commit to a girl he knocked up instead of Cary Grant."

","One of my main problems with this movie is that the cast thinks that they're so effing funny. Half of the film consists of the guys laughing at their own jokes, and they are kinda funny, but I don't need to be prompted to laugh every three minutes. Moving past that, it's a really funny movie. I don't usually like Katherine Heigl, but she's good in this role, and she works well with Seth Rogen. All of the minor characters, from Ken Jeong to Bill Hader to Kristen Wiig are wonderful. (And Craig Robinson just breaks my heart.) Another issue I have is that the movie's synopsis completely ignores Heigl's character and instead makes the movie about Seth Rogen. This is wrong, because the movie is about the two of them equally (well, maybe 60% Rogen / 40% Heigl). I don't think I'd call it ""sexist"" like Katherine Heigl has, but it's incorrectly marketed, and that's just as bad to me."

","Knocked Up is all about Seth Rogen. He is clearly a fresh voice in Hollywood for the X- Generation and below. His comedy instincts and his timing are reminiscent of the great Albert Brooks (see Modern Romance). This is about Rogen's third or forth time out playing virtually the same character. But it worked for Albert Brooks for 40 years so I guess Rogen has some more time to perfect the character which he already does a brilliant job with. What happens here is Ben Stone, played by Rogen, has a one-night stand with Alison Scott (the ever hot Katherine Heigl). She is an assistant on the E! cable show who rises to reporter just as she discovers she is pregnant so she chooses to hide that fact. The secret isn't easy and isn't helped much by Rogen's character whose out of control life and lack of maturity provide us with consistent laughter. Heigl plays this character to perfection and easily holds he own against Rogen's nuttiness. This is a warm, sweet and very funny film that definitely has its share of comedy moments but there just isn't enough of those moments nor is there enough here that we haven't seen before from the same guys. Â• Posters for the movie consist of the two main characters in the same mood. We see them sitting and we see close up face shots. Again, nothing new here."

"zetes","8","7","18","3 June 2007"," Very funny, as well as touching. But it has some problems.
","Sweet-natured romantic comedy about a one-night stand that results in pregnancy. The two reluctant parents are Ben (Seth Rogan), an unemployed stoner, and Alison (Katherine Heigl), a newly hired reporter for the E! cable network. The film follows their experiences and their rocky relationship. We also spend a lot of time with Alison's sister and brother-in-law (Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd), as well as Ben's roommates (too many to mention, but is Jonah Hill Chris Penn's love child or what?). The film runs a tad over two hours long, and with all these characters, it feels rushed. I liked the characters, but wanted to know them better. I think Alison especially gets short-changed. Writer/director Apatow's experience surely lies with Ben, and it feels like we spend a lot more time with him. I didn't feel like I understood Alison's choices. A career-minded 20-something Los Angelina gets knocked up by a chubby, pot-smoking under-construction porn site running loser. Yeah. I honestly never believed that this character would have a baby. The film addresses the abortion issue, but in a flippant manner. Joanna Kerns pops up in one scene as Alison's mother, and advises her to get an abortion. It's clearly just there so a conservative audience can hiss at her. Sorry, folks, but people like Alison have abortions every day of the week and twice on Sundays. Without a little more background, I don't buy it. I'm also left perplexed at the absolute plethora of pop culture references. What purpose do they serve other than to date the film immediately? They talk about going to see Spider-Man 3, for Christ's sake! Despite those grumbles, the film is quite enjoyable. I liked Apatow's previous film, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, but felt it could have been funnier. Knocked Up succeeds a lot better in its comedy. It does rely a bit too much on the stoner roommates, and a scene where Rogan and Rudd take mushrooms during Cirque de Soleil is not nearly as funny as Apatow seems to think it is. But, heck, I laughed a lot during the film. And I was touched to a certain extent. Very worthwhile, though I'd definitely recommend Waitress over this."

I would grant that men--and I use that term loosely--between the ages of 13 and 30 who were real losers would like this movie because they would think it might be possible for them to live a life of bongs and bangs forever with no responsibility because the main character seems to have managed to do it. I can't imagine any female liking this--it is offensive and makes marriage and having children seem like some kind of life-in-death from the mind of Samuel Taylor Coleridge--only without his actual writing skills. I think generally that the reliance on the f--- word for comedy is inversely proportional to the writer's actual skill. A loser movie only losers and the truly juvenile would like."

The themes shown in this film are well executed (love,ageism,pregnancy etc). I think the main reason what makes this the best comedy flick of 2007 is the fact that while watching this you can actually relate to the subjects which are going on in the film. At the end of the film it left me wanting more, i wanted to actually see them in a few years time or something like that, thats why i feel that they could quite easily squeeze a sequel out of this, that could get them just as much money at the box office."

However, with Katherine Heigl leading the cast, I was taken in. Always a fan of the young lady, I was sadly disappointed. My advice for those wondering if they should see this movie -- If you're over 40, it probably isn't going to be what you're looking for. 13-30 and immature, go for it. The writer is on your level.

That would be fine, but it just ain't that funny (for the most part). As likable an actor as Seth Rogan is, it was pretty hard for me to like him in this, despite that plot contortions to elicit the audience's sympathy.<br/><br/>What saves this film from failure is the provocative, original dialog in the more serious moments that explores relationship issues and gender differences.

Steve Carrell was like that at one time, but his success has boomed lately, and there is no doubt. Well, they call it Entry-level for a reason.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen consider themselves pledges into the Frat Pack, and after seeing this, I can understand why they haven't been inducted yet. This movie, although not very original, was cute, and had about 9 big laughs. Other than that, it was very drawn out and goofy.<br/><br/>Despite some shots of birth and a heart to heart with some elderly ones in once scene, there is not a serious bone in this movie's body. It's not the writing, and it is not the directing, both were pretty well done, except I saw the boom Mic in one scene(it was an advanced screening so it will surely be edited out) but it's the star of the movie. Seth Rogen is a genius, don't get me wrong, but his looks should have been a cue that he wasn't made for the lead role. This part would have been great for Jonah, instead he looked like a glasses-less freak with one liners.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie, but only because it exhibits an occurrence that only occurs once in a great while, and that is ""jumping the shark"". This movie stopped being funny, and got a little cheesy towards the end, and trust me, the ending leaves me at ""So, are they happy?"" Go and see it for yourselves, many people will like this movie.

Men are adolescent jackasses, women are snotty bitches: that's the extent of its perception. I've always been a fan of Katherine Heigl's, but in this role, every time she tried to show a liking for anyone or anything, she came across to me as cold and false.

","Judd Apatow delivers again in what is easily his most poignant comedy while still staying true to the antics of his usual band of characters. ""Knocked Up"" is able to still deliver a lot of the laughs while being honest and meaningful: in other words, something for both guys and girls to enjoy equally. While some might argue that both kind of cheat the other of realizing their full potential (it's not meaningful enough or funny enough), I say the strategy works perfectly.<br/><br/>The true quality of this film emerges in the simple contrast between its main characters: Ben, a 23-year-old jobless stoner played by Rogen and Alison, an up-and-coming talent for TV network E! The fact that they have irresponsible sex and Alison gets pregnant forces their different lives together, which allows for a lot of humor in addition to serious relationship drama. With some great writing, Apatow really finds a way to make this a movie everyone can see, enjoy, laugh at and take something away from--a guaranteed success.<br/><br/>If you're a girl, you will love Heigl if you for some reason you don't already which means you're one of no people who doesn't watch ""Grey's Anatomy"" and falls into the target demographic for this film. I would go as far as to say she's so talented that she's rather above this film and doesn't fit. Both she and Leslie Mann, who plays her sister, have a great rep on screen and turn this into a film that can be almost as much for girls as it is for guys. For the guys, Rogen is great in his first leading role and his posse of friends including Jason Segel and Jonah Hill keep the comic relief coming quickly if you feel there isn't enough of it. Their humor doesn't dominate the film, but there's a healthy dose--I didn't find it shortchanged although it was not exactly side-splitting. Rogen is most skilled at being able to do both the romantic comedy and the stoner comedy and not seeming unnatural.<br/><br/>Of all the films he produces, the ones Apatow directs (this film and ""40-Year-Old Virgin"") seem to be the most meaningful ones. His style is very natural and allows for focus on the situations, dialogue and characters, portraying them in a way that is truest to real life. In this sense, ""Knocked Up"" trounces ""Virgin."" If you've been in a serious relationship, you've heard all these lines before and of course unplanned pregnancy is a very real occurrence in this world with a set of consequences and predictable actions. The fact that he found a way to do this while still including his trademarks is a testament to his grip on the film industry and will guarantee him a lot more success until someone can match his comedic prowess. Until then, any films with the Apatow tag on them will be the most anticipated comedies each year."
"onelegobuilder","2","3","6","9 May 2008"," over-rated, overdone, and overly profane
","-Lots of spoilers-<br/><br/>Have you ever seen such a tacky, vulgar, and mind-numbing comedy? I swear this could have been made 20 years ago and for a fraction of the budget. ""Knocked Up"" is about as lame as ""Porky's"" and ""Teen Wolf"" (Both 80's comedies) that trade Sex for film-making skills. <br/><br/>I watched this movie on DVD expecting to laugh myself to death. Others also recommended it to me. Honestly I only got two chuckles out of this film. Which is also why I award this film only two stars. First gag was when Seth Rogen defined the word ""Prick"" to a young girl. I can't even say the one-word definition for it. The second gag was during the birth scene when one of Seth's friends enters the delivery room and Katharine Heigel screams ""Get Out!!""<br/><br/>Not only is this film too long, but its also too profane. The basic story is that Rogen and Heigel can't seem to act like reasonable, intelligent adults. If they both were mature enough, the conflict would be resolved in minutes and there wouldn't be a movie. I can't even stress enough on how many times I've heard every curse word in the book. Try putting that movie on TBS. Everyone curses so much its as if they all have tourette's syndrome and have no control of what they say. Heigel who plays a Hollywood reporter on ""E"" interviews some celebrities. There is briefly Ryan Secreast who swears the moment the cameras stop rolling. Absolutely no reaction from me. Plus she interviews Steve Carrell on the red carpet. Why she would accidentally call him an a@#hole on camera is not well explained. Even in the most public places where swearing would be inappropriate and a civil disturbance, the characters still curse just to test the audience. The language did at least work for Superbad because Rogen was being sincere about high school dialogue. In his youth he did swear on a regular basis. <br/><br/>The story in a nutshell is about two people who get drunk in a bar, and then go home for sex. After Heigel gets impatient with Rogen trying to tear open a rubber, they do it anyway without a condom. Big mistake. Several weeks later Heigel finds out she's pregnant and meets up with Rogen, so the two can make plans for the next 7-8 months. Obviously Heigel has never heard of the morning after pill. If she did she would not even worry about the absence of a condom. Silly Heigel, male condoms aren't even that effective, they can break. For the remainder of it's 2 hours 10 minutes it's uninterrupted swearing, gross out humor, and pot smoking with Rogen and all his stoner room-mates. What's worse than having a long running time is too many characters. There are dumb stoners living with Rogen, especially Jonah Hill basically being himself, an uninvolving subplot with Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann who are a not-so-happily wedded couple, and Heigel's coworkers at her job who only get a little screen time. Comedic actor Harold Ramis highlights the film while also cursing a lot, sadly though he is underused as Rogen's father. Take out all those characters and the film would be a smooth 97 minutes.<br/><br/>If this movie was meant to be a romantic comedy, it failed. With curse words, toilet humor, and a blah blah ending with no surprises, it is neither funny, nor heartwarming. Avoid it!"

","I remember all the hype surrounding this movie, and how it was supposed to be the funniest movie of 2007, or the summer. Umm, okay, sure...whatever you say. The problems I had: 1. The fact of the matter is, this movie ran way too long. It ran a little over two hours, which is unheard of for a comedy. They drew way too much out to make this movie.<br/><br/>2. The characters were all inconsiderate jerks, but no one wanted to realize it, mainly the women. The men were forced to realize how ""wrong"" they were, but we don't get a full resolution of the women's bitterness.<br/><br/>2a. It played on the idea of men being irresponsible loser idiot, and women are ball-busting b***hes who can say or do anything they want because they're women. For example, the Debbie character was a completely selfish example, who gave husband Pete a hard time over anything he did, even though she completely overreacted (i.e. his reaction to a possible sexual offender in his neighborhood). When he explains the ""band concerts"" he's attended (really a fantasy baseball league"") he explains that he lied because he knew she would harass him over it. I'll admit the lying on his part was wrong, but her reaction showed just how she didn't care about anyone other than herself. Apparently this anti-male sentiment spills over to Alison's character, as she throws Ben out of her car in the middle of the street, following a bitter argument.<br/><br/>3. The ad-libbing was just horrible. They tried too hard in way too many scenes.<br/><br/>4. Some people got tired of the foul language.

It raised a smile occasionally, initially, but descended to a pervasive negativity that just soured a great day.<br/><br/>It's based on the extreme improbability of a successful and gorgeous young woman falling for the very worst of maleness.

A depressing and insulting generalisation. <br/><br/>And all the bickering, yelling and negativity...""Humor""?? How is a father being unfaithful to his family in an extreme strip club scene ""funny""? Who's laughing - his seven year-old? His wife? Female roles were dreadful and debased, except Heigl's - only two women had roles which did not involve displaying their breasts. <br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Some reviewers must have seen locally censored versions. I've seen comments here such as, ""nice and clean"", ""sweet"" and ""Apatow includes little or no sex at all in this film."" However, the version that I saw had a great deal of crude sexual content - in fact more full-on female pornography than I have seen in a mainstream movie in a very long time.

The leads had no chemistry, and no lines which gave them half a chance to be funny. The lead male's group of stoner friends were as generic and useless as they come, and their attempts at comedy were the worst in the movie. The guy who played Mike in Friends wasn't even funny in this, which shows how bad the writing was, as he did OK in Friends. Overall, it seemed like Knocked Up was knocked up in a couple of hours by pulling together the stories from a couple of other bad teen pregnancy movies and imitating their comic styles.

But it doesn't stop there, it gets even more far-fetched: After you find out that this guy impregnated you, and after you see that this guy is a stoner and a total loser, and a 2nd look shows you that he's still chubby and slobby, you commit to this guy and to building a relationship, and to having/raising his baby. Well, this movie wouldn't exist without this completely improbable plot. It would be fine if the whole tone of the movie was just as absurd, but the movie seeks to explore relationships, watch characters make meaningful changes, and teach lessons. This pablum continues as the movie closes with the stereotypical, feel-good ending about the happy future for this couple. More improbability: Joanna Kerns has a cameo as Katharine Heigl's mother - this actress is 60 years old(?) but her excellent lighting and plastic surgery makes her look like she's 25 - and we're supposed to believe that this is what a person's mother normally looks like.

Only when I had an itch. I didn't think anything could be more overrated, over-hyped and completely meaningless and forgetful than the gosh-awful ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" but I was wrong. ""Knocked up"" blows that away for ""why would anyone pay money for this?"" I did not find one character likable, believable or interesting. I was totally annoyed at the whining, the over glamorization of ""E! Entertainment Network"", the over acting and over simplification of these actors AND their characters and situations.<br/><br/>Be honest: This feature film WAS an ABC after-school special you paid $12-$15 to see. And I shouldn't compare ABC Aftershool specials to this mess because many of them were light-years in interest, emotion and entertainment than this one.<br/><br/>Knocked up starts out well meaning enough - a career woman gets a promotion, goes out to celebrate and gets totally bombed, has one night casual sex with the ugliest guy in the bar, and later finds herself ""knocked up.""

"GrigoryGirl","2","3","7","18 April 2008"," Quite possibly the most overrated movie in film history....
","When I heard about this film, I really had no desire to see it. Then seeing that it was one of the best reviewed films ever on Rotten Tomatoes, I decided to see why many of the nation's critics were proclaiming this film to be a major masterpiece, on line with some of the greatest comedies ever committed to celluloid. Normally, when a film has a 90 percent approval on Rotten Tomatoes, I am suspicious. The vulgarity of the film doesn't bother me. The childishness of most of the main characters doesn't bother me. What deeply offends me is the preposterousness of the main story. These 2 characters would never get together in real life, only in a contrived, forced feel good movie such as this. This is another variation on stoner slob ""regular"" guy meets impossibly beautiful woman, and they get it on. Hollywood is probably to blame for bad relationships across the board in this country because of films like this. In reality, if a woman got pregnant by a guy like this, she would either have the baby on her own, or more likely, procure an abortion (probably the latter). It feels like that cliché that the ""couple should stay together for the kids"", which in the long run hurts the children. In reality, the woman would have woken up the next morning, realised she made a mistake, and would have taken care of it.<br/><br/>The film does have some funny moments. I especially like Ryan Seacrest, who is actually the funniest thing in the film. There's a scene where Seth tokes on a bong with a gas mask on, which I found to be cool. And some of Seth's friends repartee is amusing, though not incredible sweet, touching, and hilarious as the critics are trying to make us believe. It boggles the mind that the critics would make this film sound like a masterpiece. Maybe Judd Apatow is a really cool guy and treats critics well. Or maybe our standards are pretty abysmal right now, so a mediocre film like this gets raised to the level of Duck Soup and Lawrence of Arabia.<br/><br/>Overall, there's a few funny bits here and there, but the main story is so preposterous it's insulting.

"cafesmitty","5","3","7","25 February 2008"," So This is what passes for Comedy?
","This isn't the worst film nor the best film, but after hearing so much about it, it was the most disappointing comedy of 2007. The humor is flat, the relationship is totally unbelievable. The plot surrounds a hot blonde (Kate) out celebrating her promotion to on screen on E!, she has a one night stand with ultimate slacker dude (Seth). They go their separate ways and weeks later she calls him up and tells him she is pregnant. He is a guy who lives with other guys and their main goal in life is weed and porn and yet, she starts falling for the guy because (and sarcasm is coming up), they have so much in common! So the humor is suppose to be how surprisingly shock she is when she finds his humor crude,oafish, and that of a highschool senior. Unfortunately, for me, this become boring after 10 minutes and it goes on throughout the movie. He says the inappropriate things, always, seemingly at the wrong time. It's the typical, and I do mean, by-the-books, typical star-cross romantic comedy, where, at the end, he decided to clean up his act and change his ways and she learns to accept his friends. Give us something different. It's like we keep getting spinoffs from The Wedding Crashers and Bruce Almighty. You know, Bruce Almighty & Wedding Crashers begot 40 Year old Virgin, 40 Year Old Virgin begot, Knocked Up and now Knocked UP begets Superbad. I am sure that the guy who played McLovin will have his own film. Knocked Up is a spin off of a spin off of a spin off and each one gets less funnier. There are only a couple of really funny moments in the movie but overall this film is in the middle of the road. Humorous, yes, but outrageously funny, not even close."

How can a viewer identify with characters who pretend to being gentle, caring people, then behave so aggressively, so badly to each other?

"steverino171","6","3","7","13 June 2007"," Funny Bits, But No Classic
","The most interesting lesson learned from Judd Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" is one about the statistics of a tomatometer. The film has scored 91% ripe tomatoes on Rotten Tomatoes, usually an indication that a movie is truly excellent. Films like ""The Godfather"" or ""Casablanca"" score 90% or more ripe tomatoes. However, the assumption that a high score guarantees a moving, enlightening cinematic experience is unfounded. What the 90% rating means is that most critics thought the movie was worth seeing, not necessarily that it was a superior film. This seems to be the case for ""Knocked Up""a decidedly mediocre yet watchable movie with the good fortune of being wedged between releases of ""Spiderman 3"" and ""The Transformers"" and its ilk so that it can cash in on whatever genre elements that separate it from those tiresome actioners. In short, despite its high ratings, critics thought the film was decent (probably because they're tired of watching action movies based on children's' cartoons) but not excellent.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" is exactly this. This highly formulaic frat-boy romantic comedy has some well drawn moments, but ultimately it's an all quite forgettable tale of boy meets girl, loses girl, grows up, gets girl back. Although, one thing that is not entirely forgettable is the tenuous credibility of the film's premise, which involves a coupling of the most unlikely pair of people, a peculiar glossing over of character motivations (why no abortion?), and an affirmation of traditional family structures and value of conformity worthy of a TV sitcom.<br/><br/>Also, with the exception of a few truly inspired moments, the comedy of ""Knocked Up"" relies on crude, sophomoric potty humor that has found broad acceptance thanks to films and TV shows such as ""American Pie"" and ""South Park."" Although it should be noted that gross-out comedies were just as prominent in the 1980s (""Porky's,"" ""Caddyshack""), which makes their popularity now a bit confounding considering how stale the jokes have become by now. Granted the gags of ""Knocked Up"" are mostly verbal not graphic and a predicated on the embarrassment of social awkwardness rather than grossness for its own sake. In Apatow's film the characters refer to their antics with frankness, as when they describe how they've managed to pass on pink eye to nearly everyone in the household via flatulence. Fortunately, Apatow spares us an explicit depiction. Unfortunately, either way (verbal or graphic) the gag isn't funny. Certainly some audience members will get a chuckle out of their repartee because they can identify with the characters, situation, and/or the obsession with bodily functions from their own childhood. But the humor in farting on someone's pillow is for 10 year olds. And a movie about a couple dealing with an unwanted pregnancy is for adults. So, although it's not very upsetting that some guys in the audience might see this joke on the screen and reminisce about a more carefree time in their lives, it is disturbing that professional filmmakers, screenwriters, and actors see fit to include such banality in their movies rather than demanding higher standards of wit and insight from each other and themselves. It's troubling to consider how much money these people spent (and how much they've made) making this movie when you they felt the need to include fart jokes in it. I for one could do better. I guess a lot of other people could too.<br/><br/>But perhaps most confounding of all is the few moments of wit and satire that make the film worth seeing: why didn't the makers insist on being clever throughout the movie. For example, in an interview with her boss Katherine Heigl's character is promoted to on-camera interviewer to the consternation of one of her female colleague. Her pointed off-hand mumblings (""Yeah, I was so surprised too."") are precious, as are her boss's gentle but persistent suggestions about ""tightening up."" Scenes like these, which are too few and far between in a two hour plus comedy, make this a decent, watchable movie. But, don't be fooled by all those shiny red tomatoes. It's no ""Casablanca."""

","Don't believe the hype about this movie. If it is the funniest movie of the year it is only because there wasn't very many to pick from. It has been compared to ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", but it is only half as funny (probably due to Steve Carell not being one of the writers). Some of the jokes have already been done in other movies about women who suddenly get pregnant and don't know what to do. That alone really isn't very funny, and it's hard to make that situation into a comedy.<br/><br/>It's also not very romantic. Although there are a couple a sweet moments between the main characters, they seem to lack an on screen chemistry between each other. I have a hard time believing the two would be anything more than friends.<br/><br/>All the way through I kept thinking something was missing, like a main actor. Seth Rogen (Ben Stone), and Katherine Heigl (Alison Scott) make great supporting actors but they don't have enough shine and charisma to carry main roles.<br/><br/>If you're looking for rip roaring, teary eyed, laugh until your stomach hurts, this movie is not it.

","Knocked Up sounded just like The 40 Year Old Virgin did when I first heard about it. Raunchy, disrespectful, vulgar, and stupid. I was wrong about The 40 Year Old Virgin, and I was wrong about Knocked Up. What you've got is by far the best comedy of the year, because it's clever, romantic, sweet, and most of all, absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is the typical loser. He smokes pot, watches nude scenes in movies, and sits on his rear all day doing nothing. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl looking absolutely gorgeous) has everything going for her. She just got promoted at the E! Network, and she is finally ready to make a life of her own. When Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) takes her out to celebrate, Ben and Alison meet and there is an instant connection. Many drinks and hours later, the unlikely pair head back to her house for some fun. Fast forward 8 weeks. Alison finds out she's pregnant by the loser Ben, but the two vow to try and make a relationship work between them for the sake of their child.<br/><br/>Now, first off, this story could actually be written as a dramatic movie/coming of age story. How Judd Apatow got so much comedy out of this is proof of his comedic genius. He is the King of Comedy. There are religion jokes (great all the way through), sex jokes, fart jokes, pot jokes, relationship jokes, and everything else you can think of. They are nonstop and vary between witty and just plain stupid, and that's the brilliance of it. The cameos of Ryan Seacrest and James Franco are unforgettable. Not a scene goes by without a laugh, even serious ones. Apatow's direction and the timing of actors like Rogen, Mann, and Paul Rudd allow for those humorous moments to weave seamlessly with the drama, not taking anything away from it. It really is brilliant directing and writing on the part of Judd Apatow. Wonderful job.<br/><br/>The actors are equally as brilliant, especially Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd. Rogen does a great job of building a character. When we meet Ben, he's a lazy, sleazy slacker, but Rogen evolves him as the film goes on into a sweet and good man. He's good, but he still has problems. The film will also delve into the things men don't understand about women and vice versa. At first, you'll like only Alison, but by the end you'll love both of them. Katherine Heigl has a knack for inserting drama into stupid comedies and making them better. She really knows how to take a director's advice and make the best out of it. She is extremely likable as Alison, and yes, her looks definitely help her, even though she spends a majority of the movie pregnant. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are absolutely hysterical as the reluctantly married couple. Rudd gives one of the strongest supporting performances in a comedy I've ever seen. Every scene between Rudd and Rogen is unmissable. Rudd has some of the best comedic timing in the business, and it's on display at its best here. Harold Ramis is also great as Ben's father, as are Jonah Hill and Jason Segel (a Craig Bierko look-a-like) in roles as Ben's friends. His 4 friends account for some of the best jokes in the movie.<br/><br/>The only faults I find with Knocked Up are its runtime (just about 2hrs 10mins) and the fact that it is eerily similar to The 40 Year Old Virgin. The male characters in each movie are each thrown into a situation they don't want to be in, each male character has 4 friends supporting him all the way, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, and Jonah Hill are in both movies, and even some of the jokes are recycled. The fact of the matter is, if you liked The 40 Year Old Virgin, you'll like Knocked Up. It really is a great comedy that shouldn't be missed. It's also an excellent date movie...if you're old enough. This is a very R rated movie, not for anyone under 17 or 18. Go see it while there's lots of people in the theater, trust me.<br/><br/>9/10 --spy"

","I wouldn't say that Judd Apatow is reinventing comedy but he definitely adds substance that most comedies do not have. Most comedies are bad because they do not have to be good to make money. Clichéd jokes make money. So when a comedy comes along that takes the service to actually be funny (or disservice if you are brain dead member of the general public that helped make NORBIT and WILD HOGS international hits) it is enormously refreshing. And when that movie can make a hundred million dollars in the process, well, that makes one think that maybe there is hope for this country.<br/><br/>Well that movie was called 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN which was able to achieve such a rare combination. And director Apatow and a chunk of the cast are back for the not-quite-as-funny-but-still-pretty-damn-good follow-up, KNOCKED UP.<br/><br/>KNOCKED UP has the same brilliant interaction between the main characters, highlighted by the brilliant conversation about how MUNICH was the first movie where Jews were able to kick ass and take names. Main star Ben, played by rising star Seth Rogen, claims one night at a bar that if any of them get laid to night it is ""because of Eric Bana."" Well unfortunately for Ben Mr. Bana's ass kicking charm worked a little too well and he ends up going home with a recently promoted E! Entertainment Channel reporter named Allsion (GREY'S ANATOMY'S Katherine Heigl). Allison finds out she is pregnant five months later and must approach Ben, whom she is increasingly disgusted with, to tell her she is, well, knocked up. He decides he wants to help any way possible. He enters her life permanently followed by romance and a possible family.<br/><br/>Why this film works, along with the hilarious jokes, is because it takes a very real approach to life. It doesn't rely on lazy relationship stereotypes. Ben is a jobless slacker who is trying to create a website with his buddies helping men know at what time their favorite actresses are naked in films. But where most films would show the male as a loner and slacker who slowly needs to realize that love is in front of him he just needs to grow up this film shows that Ben, though definitely a slacker and immature, likes Allison the while time. He WANTS to grow up, just doesn't know how. And where most films would have Allison begging to be with Ben and have a family, in real life most men would kill to be with a girl like Allison. So she is the one in charge of the relationship and having the issues, not Ben.<br/><br/>The truth is in life men can be just as eager and zealous to be with woman and this movie takes no shortcuts and shows you a world where serious situations can happen to real peopletough hilariously.<br/><br/>And if nothing else see the film Ben's roommate Jason claiming that he can't wait till its time to look up Felicity Huffman's nude scenes because he's had a thing for her since TRANSMERICA. Earning the most rousing, yet delayed, laughs of the movie. Highly recommend."

","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is a weed smoking party animal and leader of his pack of friends.

Then after one drunken night at the bar, they end up in an one-night stand.<br/><br/>Writer/director Judd Apatow is bringing the mj smoking, gross out, inappropriate comedy to a new frontier.

","I only watched this because my wife is pregnant and wanted to see it. A few of my friends had went to see it as their ""chick-flick"" night out and had told me it wasn't any good so my expectations weren't high.<br/><br/>Thankfully, they were wrong.<br/><br/>I thought this was a witty and well written film, aided on my part by the stunningly good looking Heigl playing the female lead, and with a plethora of funny supporting roles, played notably by the three J's, Jason, Jonah and Jay.<br/><br/>They provide a witty aside and some cringe worthy moments (the pink eye scene just gets worse in the explaining!) but even the straight comedy moments of the awkward interaction between Heigl (Alison) and Seth Rogen (aptly named as Ben Stone) are well acted. The scene in the diner on the morning after the night before shows how well the 2 main characters combine and displays a familiar awkwardness to which I'm sure most of us can relate from some relationship or another.<br/><br/>Overall, some of the parts of the plot are a bit telegraphed and it follows the generic ""will-they won't-they"" script that fits all rom-coms but this one passes the test of being funny to me and suiting my ""missus"".<br/><br/>*Worth a visit to rental store and will keep your other half quiet 'til its your turn to choose again*."
"Funnyman1235","8","2","4","21 February 2008"," Knocked Out of the Ball Park?
","Forgive the rather redundant pun. The end of the day what I should try and summarise quickly is that this comedy is actually funny. Considering that my view of romantic comedies is that they tend to play for the safe laughs and an expected happy ending. Knocked Up does not do that.<br/><br/>The premise itself is rather risqué when painted as a romantic comedy (which this film is over the gross out comedy more often associated American Pie or Apatow's other work The 40 Year Old Virgin) as essentially a slacker impregnates a beautiful, though equally clueless, woman.<br/><br/>Overlooked completely are the leads in this movie. While Rogen gets most of the laughs (and deservedly so) it is Heigl who gives the best performance. Her breakdown in the clinic is completely believable and brings a tear to even the most unemotional human being. Equal applause should go to Leslie Mann (Apatow's real life wife) who despite being essentially the nemesis of the piece gives just as important a performance as a woman trapped in a souring marriage. Paul Rudd is the only of the four leads who isn't given enough to really shine. Hilarious in Anchorman and Apatow's earlier piece here he feels like an add-on to the main cast.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the film is brilliantly written and superbly performed by everyone. The highlights are undoubtedly the beard jokes ('your face looks like Robin Williams' knuckles) and Harold Ramis' Alzheimers skit. All the while remember that the two leads are actually have a lot of the same neuroses and fears as anyone in a relationship and that is perhaps the film's strongest point that despite the aesthetic differences between the pair. Ben actually makes Alison happy after initial teething's and that perhaps is the strongest suit of the film that the pair are completely believable despite the inevitable smutty jokes. It is well observed and masterfully executed.<br/><br/>See this film!"

","What really struck me was how a lot of what goes on in ""Knocked Up"" seems to come from real life. It's one of those movies I like to call ""real life, only funnier"".<br/><br/>Okay, first you have to be able to suspend your disbelief long enough to buy into Alison Scott, a young, ambitious and gorgeous entertainment interviewer, having a one night stand with and eventually falling for a slovenly, poorly dressed slacker.<br/><br/>Once you make this leap, however, the film takes you to a lot of very real and funny places. The emotionally charged scenes seem to be pulled right out of real life.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong--this is not a sappy romantic comedy. Remember, this is the guy (Judd Apatow) who gave us The 40 Year Old Virgin, among many others. Don't worry, guys, there's lots of silliness and toilet humour, but there's stuff for your girlfriend, too.<br/><br/>Kudos to Leslie Mann, who plays a character that is often very unlikeable (from a man's perspective, anyway), but important to driving the conflict in the story. She's the grounding force in this ensemble cast.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd always seems to fit in well with any ensemble and brings a lot of his comedy chops with him. Excellent casting.<br/><br/>Of course, the scenes with Paul and Seth are just damn funny, as are the scenes with his room mates. Seth Rogen was a great choice to play the lead. I found myself routing for Ben to transform himself into a man that Alison would want to be with, and was there with him through the highs and lows.<br/><br/>There's a sweetness between Ben and Alison that really helps you get past the vast difference in their stations in life. You would think that it would be easy to find a pretty girl to play Alison, but it seems that not many pretty girls are great at comedy. Even though Katherine Heigl has to play the ""straight man"" in most scenes, she does get to flex her acting and comedic muscles as the hormonal pregnant lady. I was especially fond of the labour scene. If this were a scene from ""Scary Movie"", she would have turned into Regan from ""The Exorcist"".<br/><br/>Of course, the room mates are also awesome, all very funny actors, and comedy seems to come very easily and naturally in their scenes.<br/><br/>Though the premise may seem like a bit of a stretch, much stranger things happen in real life. I also like that two of the characters are Canadian ;-)."
"Rapsicle","9","2","4","30 December 2007"," Funny, yes, but somehow weirdly beautiful. One to watch!
","I started watching this film with a scepticism, i expected it to be funny, and vulgar, with witty jokes, and that is exactly what i got. However, when the film centred in on the love of Alison (Katherine Heigl) and Ben (Seth Rogen) and the birth, it was actually a weirdly beautiful thing. I'm not one to enjoy any films to do with love and all that rubbish (hence why i chose to watch this film) but towards the end, i started to enjoy the lovely-dovey stuff that came to light and enjoyed it even more with the jokes that tended to deter away from the sad/love things. There were many jokes surrounding the life of the group of pot smokers, but, i didn't expect a lot of the jokes to be well thought up and to be honest, quite smart. Obviously with a film like this you get the basic jokes that were in-your-face but i feel there was just the right amount of it for it still to work.<br/><br/>Also, there was the gorgeous Katherine Heigl as a lead which made it more aesthetically pleasing but also the character of Ben performed brilliantly by Seth Rogen which tended to make it more accessible to the viewers as, lets be honest, he is physically blessed but he acting was top knock and he was very funny.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to you as it is a must-see. If you are only into romance-type films, then i would steer clear, but only if you cannot appreciate some toilet humour, if you can, there is still an element of love and it should be seen. Don't BE DETERRED if you do enjoy the films about weed and silly jokes, because that is predominantly what this film is about and the jokes are very funny."

One day, after taking care of a Ryan Seacrest (playing himself) seriously angry with self-important 'celebrities' such as the incredibly talentless Jessica Simpson (who ironically appears later very briefly as herself in a silent cameo role) she is summoned to her boss (Alan Tudyk)'s office and is told that she's been promoted to on-screen reporter.<br/><br/>She goes out with her control-obsessed (during the 'pedophiles in our neighborhood' scene I wanted her husband to close the laptop on her hands) sister Debbie (Leslie Mann).<br/><br/>Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is the quintessential loser; he has no work but checking out movies to find out when and where the stars (female... I'm guessing they were going to open a male section after the launch) get naked (from which stems one of the funniest quotes: 'When Harry Met Sally's... ahem, happy place'), is tubby, unshaved, loves to play retarded games and smoke pot with his friends.<br/><br/>He happens to be in the same club Alison is, they meet, flirt with each other and before they know it it's off to the bedroom.<br/><br/>Eight weeks later... Ben's phone rings. It's Alison and she's pregnant. A terrified Ben decides to face his responsibilities and be there for the girl, in the meanwhile he becomes friends with his 'brother-in-law' Pete (Paul Rudd), who feels so suffocated by his wife he feels the need to hide his need to have some 'me time', and later confesses to not feel worthy of his wife, and helps him and Alison's sister to work out the kinks in their marriage, faces the truth about the patheticness of his life and attitude and basically decides to start a new chapter in his life, especially after his behavior during an earthquake while Alison was sleeping at his.<br/><br/>And as the due date nears, Alison and Ben begin to seriously fall in love...<br/><br/>This is one of the cases where the hype is actually well deserved; the directing and the writing work on all levels with a surprising ability to go from the laugh-until-I-die to the moving and back again, and the cast is absolutely up to par, from the charismatic Heigl and endearing Rogen, to the more experienced Rudd and Mann, to the actors playing the circle of Ben's friends (one of which played one of the main characters in 'Superbad', or did he?).<br/><br/>Definitely a movie to get on DVD.<br/><br/>Knocked Up (Italian Title: Molto Incinta (Very Pregnant)): 9/10."

","I couldn't help grinning from ear to ear upon reading the review of Knocked Up by a columnist in the paper. Instead of reviewing much of the movie, he played 'spot the obvious' and went complaining about the censorship board in Malaysia. Among one of the points raised by him was the fact that even though the film was labeled 18PL, the film was still butchered anyway by the censorship board. So why have censorship? It explains why the DVD black market is still up and running.<br/><br/>The best I could say right now is that we acknowledge the fact that the censorship board is redundant and we are just tired of complaining anyway so we opt out by watching films elsewhere. But in any case, I could only imagine how the censored version of Knocked Up would end up like which is why I am ever so grateful that I could watch the film in its entirety this morning and boy, was it a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Ben Stone (played by Seth Rogen) and his stoned friends dream of making a fortune with a website that reveals where and when movie stars get naked in movies while Alison Scott (played by Katherine Heigl) who just got promoted to become a presenter on E! Having been told to 'tighten' (become thinner la) for the sake of the job, it would be a nightmare if she were to get pregnant, right? Well her worst nightmare comes true after chance brings them together in a bar and that one-night stand that they would have would end up as something that would change their lives forever. After all the moral dilemma facing them both, Alison decides to keep the baby with both Alison and Ben deciding to give each other a chance for the sake of the baby. As the nine months pass these two by, tolerance turns to accommodation which turns to true love for the two.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, I love Katherine Heigl. I really do. She looks classy, beautiful and at the same time, she looks a tad vulnerable which makes her even more appealing. But anyhow, the best thing about this movie is that both Heigl and Rogen make the movie believable with a sense of chemistry that matches the biological magnitude fazed by them. The ups and downs of their post-pregnancy relationship constantly tugs at your heart leaving you with warmth and fuzziness that only a Disney family flick would have but the obscenity (which also happens to make most of the movie funny) makes it ""Thou shalt not pass"" for kids under 21.<br/><br/>Parallel to the Alison-Ben relationship issues is the strained marriage between Alison's sister Debbie and her husband Pete who feels the pressure of being married and cannot believe how Debbie could love him so much. All guys face that, don't they? Not believing how a girl that hot could be with a us. Well, when these guys are at home,they complain at the fact that they can't hang out and live free anymore but when on the road, they FINALLY realize how much they miss their ladies and with tails between their legs, they come home to their women. My only qualms was the fact that the movie never really delved into the issue of abortion, but then, if she went for abortion, the movie would end by the half-hour mark, wouldn't it? But all is not doom and gloom as though there may only be a few laughs out there, but when the jokes come, they come at you fast and furious. Some of the best jokes were concerning Alison and Ben having sex with Ben being worried that his penis may poke the unborn child's head and Alison visiting the many gynecologists with one looking at her vagina and exclaiming ""So you do look like your sister!"" Watch out for Dr Kuni though. He steals the show whenever he appears. It's also too bad that two of the funniest scenes (one involving an alternate take with Dr Kuni) were not in the final cut but fortunately, they are on YouTube though.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, we'll constantly find ourselves having our fingers crossed hoping that everything will end up rosy for Debbie and Pete, and more importantly Alison and Ben and we do get the happy ending but even then, there is always a doubt in my mind that either couples could just break-up anytime. We hope that love conquers all but then, the cynic in us will just creep out eventually and ask if love is actually enough to hold these two together."

While I really did enjoy this, I liked it in a different way. It's actually easier to relate to this situation and (some of) these characters than the ones in writer/director Judd Appatow's last film. The plot of this is pretty simple. After a night of partying and drinking, strangers Ben Stone (Rogen) and Allison Scott (Heigl) have sex, she gets pregnant. Allison is a hard worker and Ben doesn't work and is interested only in smoking pot with his friends and watching films where women undress. ""Knocked Up"" managed to have some really hilarious comedy, and the next moment it seamlessly went to drama that was actually sad. The only problem I had with this was it occasionally went too much into comedy and too often relied on Ben's friends for cheap laughs, but usually it was fine and hilarious.

The focus here is on a party all nighter, who gets his girlfriend pregnant intentionally, and at a very high cost....now he's going to be a daddy, since she wants to keep the baby! Now, he's pretty much got nine months to discard his immature ways, before he becomes a father figure for life. Knocked Up handles everything very well, considering this is a Judd Apatow comedy, and it knows how to be a sexy comedy without being too raunchy. Hell, most of the time, I thought it was more serious then a comedy. The underlining message is serious, the movie is hilarious, don't misunderstand me. Altogether, this is a wonderful mix of fun, laughter, sex talk, and eventually, a beautiful baby daughter! 8 out of 10 stars....I'm rewarding this with an extra star for the parental love the film manages to capture, but didn't have to."

","A funny film by Judd Apatow Knocked Up will keep your funny bones tingling. Knocked Up includes plenty of laugh-aloud moments and many more that generate subdued chuckles. Apatow understands what audiences find funny and, more importantly, knows the criticality of comic timing. A lot of his jokes work because they are delivered perfectly. The dialogue is sharp, the characters are developed as more than props for gags and pratfalls, and there's a respect for the audience's intelligence that is often not evident in summer movies. However, what makes Knocked Up special is that it also has a heart. Deep down, Knocked Up is as much a romance as it is a comedy. The film is surprisingly touching, especially as it chronicles the attempts of the leads to find common ground. If you like raunchy humor Knocked Up is one of the best films in its genre- you won't go wrong here."

Seth Rogan is terrific, but so is Catherine Heigel, Paul Rudd, and everyone in the big supporting cast.<br/><br/>On second viewing I experienced it as having more heart but fewer laughs than I remembered - an OK trade off. Also, a couple of plot jumps bugged me a bit more - the fact that abortion is never even really considered or even discussed feels like a dodge, and the transition of this unlikely twosome into a couple, even an awkward one feels a bit quickly skipped over for a film that runs over 2 hours.

","One thing that I did not like about this movie is that it portraits men as the weaker partner in a relationship. Why do they have to obey their wives all the time? Why do they have to be the ones that have to change? They are not valued and that does not drive them away instead it makes them want these women even more. For example, the scene when Debbie accuses Pete for not caring about the offenders in the neighbour. She treats him quite bad and he just takes it. Or when she does not respect Pete's need for alone time. I do understand that the men were maybe in the wrong and were acting irresponsible but my point is why are men portrait as irresponsible and woman as the know-all and always in the rights in the first place? It's like men were the kids and woman the parents. And because of that men needed to change and beg the woman to take them back. <br/><br/>I just think that real life relationships are not like this. Woman are not always the more mature partner and therefore should not always get their way because sometimes they are wrong. But because people see movies like this, they create this idea that men should always be the ones to change or beg to get back together. Just not real life."

","Knocked-up, The movie I was so excited about when I first met the previews. It contains all the big glorifying names which I'm particularly a huge fan of, namely as; Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jason, Jonah, Leslie, Bill Hader and Katherine. They all are the comedy heroes and deliver it with utter perfection every time but unfortunately this is not happening here besides of Seth..<br/><br/>Although the movie started with an interesting plot and background, thus enabling viewers getting involved and laugh often but that managed to sustain only till the mid half of the movie. From there on, things started to get boring , full of clichés and predictable story. I literally lost interest in the second half; 65 minutes onwards to be specific. There were too many unwanted and irrelevant scenes dragging the entire fun to evaporate rapidly. Personally I feel that the movie could have been a 30mins shorter, I really had to suffer passing my time in the latter hour.<br/><br/>Coming on the caste now, as just said in the beginning, perhaps I was expecting a bit more from them, given the excitement that my favorites are gathered under a single title. But only to my disappointment, they weren't supportive enough. Neither Jason nor Jonah was impressive. SSeemed like entire responsibility was upto Seth, who in turn did a great job maintaining the standard.<br/><br/>To conclude, though my review might imprint a negative perception over the readers but it ain't that bad, trust me! ;D but yea, just be careful about the second half. Take it a friendly warning. ;p"

A romantic comedy with dramatic overtones. The only way to accept Heigl sleeping with Rogen is that she is dead drunk at the time, of course. Solid supporting cast keeps this clichéd plot moving along. Otherwise, I guarantee you've seen the story many times before.

","Knocked Up is a story of a lazy and an unemployed man Ben Stone (Rogen) and a career minded TV presenter Alison Scott (Heigl). Ben is a kind of guy who lives with his folks (played by Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel & Martin Starr). All the friends have something in common - they're all unemployed & lazy and spend most of their time fooling around, partying or watching movies or working on a website project which doesn't show much promise. Alison Scott works with E! Entertainment Television. She gets promoted to work as an on the camera presenter. To celebrate her promotion, she goes partying in a club with her elder sister (Leslie Mann) and there she meets Ben who is partying out with his friends. Ben & Alison gel together in the party and under the influence of alcohol end up sleeping together. Next morning at the breakfast table, Alison finds out that she doesn't have anything in common with Ben. The two go their respective ways only to come together again after 8 weeks when Alison finds out that she is pregnant with Ben's child. What happens next? Do the two get together or end it all with a break up? Watch it to find out!<br/><br/>The story is quite a simple one. However, what happens around the story is what makes this film a great watch. The film is laced with crude sex related humor throughout. This is what is expected when you have Seth Rogen in the movie. It also features the likes of Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel & Jonah Hill all of whom are known for crude comedy films and present their side roles in the movie as the buddies of Rogen. These characters party their heart out, tease each other, work on a p*rn website, and are lazy as shoot. All the roles have been out played flawlessly. These guys are natural at the buddy stuff and their chemistry with each other is flawless. Katherine Heigl does a fantastic job in the film. She portrays the character with finesse.<br/><br/>The film portrays the nuisances of one night stands and the resultant issues that crop up. If you go by the story itself, it feels a little stretched. However, the fantastic performances delivered by the characters and the comic events that surround the central idea of the film makes it a hilarious watch. The plot focuses on responsibility and commitment and also the way the lives of people change by the events that take place after an unwed couple gets pregnant which they hadn't planned.<br/><br/>Watch it for the excellent performances especially by Heigl & Rogen in the lead roles and also by the supporting characters who does a great job together to pull off a laugh riot film.<br/><br/>Review Link: http://confusonomics.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/movie-review- knocked-up/"
"Pycs","6","0","0","27 July 2011"," Disappointed. . .
","<ul><li>MINOR SPOILERS (Nothing that will ruin the film!!!) - </li></ul><br/><br/>I had high anticipations for this film, seeing as how it scored a 90% approval rating on RottenTomatoes and a 7.4 here. Judd Apatow's first directing effort turned out to be a delightful sex comedy in 2005's 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin.' Seth Rogen has proved to be funny (in moderations) during his early efforts, could this be the staring vehicle that launches his career? <br/><br/>The story: It follows a slacker (played by Rogen) who's one night stand with Katherine Heigl's character leads to her pregnancy. Simple plot that could of really provided big time laughs. But the narrative is so clichéd in the way it evolves. After she gets pregnant, he's shocked. Then he enters Heigl's character's life, in an aim to father the child. They (inevitably in these sort of situations) get in a fight and break up, only to reunite at the end. It's basically the formula for any Will Ferell film, just with different actors.<br/><br/>Is it funny? Ehhhhhh. Sort of. I give the film credit for not relying heavily on crude humor, as so many comedies are these days. There were genuinely funny moments in the film. I chuckled a few times throughout. But a chuckle here and there isn't enough for me to recommend the movie.<br/><br/>How'd the actors do? The acting was surprisingly good for a movie of this nature. Seth Rogen, while I didn't think he was excellent. proved to be just enough to carry the film. And Katherine Heigl, well, this is probably her best performance she's given (which doesn't say much when looking at her body of work.) Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann give great supporting help, even if they're a little overused. Some small cameos provide the funniest moments, such as Kirsten Wiig's tiny part.<br/><br/>The final verdict? 6/10. A slight above average film that's forgettable but a good way to kill some time."
"Electrified_Voltage","7","0","0","22 November 2010"," Not as funny as I could have possibly hoped for, but still a mostly enjoyable Judd Apatow comedy
","The last film I saw which Judd Apatow was involved in was ""Superbad"", and my review of that hit 2007 comedy will tell you how puzzled I was by its massive appeal! However, I had seen several Apatow movies before that one and found several of them funny. He was a producer for all these films, and wrote and/or directed SOME of them. He wrote, directed, and co-produced ""Knocked Up"", another successful R-rated comedy released the same year as ""Superbad"". I was expecting this one to be a lot funnier than the last Apatow production I saw, and in my opinion, it definitely is that. Maybe most people who have seen the two films think they're both great comedies, and I don't think either of them is, but at least I still think this one is good.<br/><br/>Alison Scott has been working behind-the-scenes at E! Television Network, but she gets promoted to an on-air position. She is single, but her older sister, Debbie has a husband named Pete, and the couple has kids. To celebrate Alison's promotion, the two sisters go to a night club. Debbie has to leave early when she hears that her daughter has chicken pox, but when this happens, Alison decides to stay behind with Ben Stone, a guy she has just met. Alison and Ben both leave drunk that night and end up having sex. However, after this one-night stand, she begins to learn about this young man and how little they have in common! Ben is an irresponsible stoner who is working on a website with his friends which tells people the exact moments when famous actresses appear naked in movies! Eight weeks later, Alison finds herself throwing up at work, and it is soon discovered that she is pregnant after her one session with Ben! <br/><br/>This Judd Apatow effort certainly doesn't start out hilarious, but there are some funny scenes near the beginning, such as the first conversation we see between Debbie and Pete. It gets really funny starting with Alison waking Ben up the morning after their night of drunken sex, which is followed by a scene showing the two of them learning about each other while out for breakfast. These are both big laughs! I even laughed when I saw Alison throwing up on the air, as wrong as that scene may be! After a while, the film goes downhill a little. There were parts which I found somewhat funny, but not as many REALLY funny moments as before. I sometimes found myself kind of struggling to stay into it, but this certainly didn't last for the rest of the viewing, and I found lots of comic highlights at different points, as the movie shows Debbie and Pete's marriage in trouble, and Alison and Ben also having problems with their relationship. The dialogue is a major part of the humour. Whether I was laughing hard or not, I did find that the story can certainly be intriguing at times, especially towards the end, and there are some touching moments which can also add to the film's quality.<br/><br/>If you're at all familiar with Judd Apatow's work, it really shouldn't surprise you that this particular film of his is very raunchy and juvenile, and obviously many people don't find this kind of humour the least bit amusing. However, while I found that this type of humour did not work in ""Superbad"" for the most part, I would say it mostly does work in this film, just like it does in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", another comedy which Apatow was a major part of. While ""Knocked Up"" isn't as consistently funny as that 2005 comedy blockbuster, which I first saw a few years ago, it succeeded in making me laugh many times, and also gave me an overall engaging story with memorable characters. These elements were enough to leave me in a good mood, and I have to give the film credit for that. If you're an adult who is into sex jokes, this could be a comedy for you, even if it doesn't COMPLETELY live up to its reputation."

","I thought this might be ""watchable"" if I had nothing else to do so I recorded it. But right from the start, I found myself intrigued because the actors are all so good. It's not a case of ""Wow, aren't they gorgeous guys and girls,"" but ""What an intelligent story this is."" Idler Hero and responsible-job heroine have a drunken one-night stand much of which they don't remember and heroine ends up pregnant. But the tables turn when the idler decides he must be a proper dad. The story comes and goes quite a bit as we go through the pregnancy and the couple are sometimes together, sometimes apart, as each is insecure with the other and the heroine isn't at all sure a future with this guy is the right answer. The hero gradually becomes more and more responsible, taking charge. The heroine learns to ask for help and support. Problems of pregnancy aren't glossed over and hero proves he is going to be a great husband and a great dad from a rather unpromising start. The final part of the movie is really delightful as hero and heroine, currently living apart, are both preparing for the birth in their separate premises now that the hero has bought his own place after years of squatting with friends. All you need to know after the birth is which home will they live in! I never went, Oh this is amazing, it isn't the kind of movie I'd rave about, but I couldn't stop watching and enjoying seeing two people become mature and learn to love each other. A child may be divisive but not in this case, it makes these two people grow up."

","I had been meaning to watch ""Knocked Up"" for a while so I was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I thought that ""The 40 year old Virgin"", made by the same Judd Apatow team, was hilarious in parts. They are plenty of funny moments in ""Knocked Up"" but not as many laugh out loud moments as the script takes an at-times reflective look at modern relationships. <br/><br/>The story is simple. Overweight slacker Ben (Seth Rogen) meets stunning career girl Alison (Katherine Heigl) in a club when both are on drunken nights out. They have sex but she decides in the morning that one night was plenty. When she later discovers she's pregnant she decides to keep the baby and contacts him to tell him the news. They decide to try to make their relationship succeed for the sake of the baby. <br/><br/>The film has a lot of thoughtful moments, as the new couple work out whether the relationship has a chance. However there are plenty of moments of gross out humour to lighten the mood, mostly involving Ben's dissolute housemates. <br/><br/>There is a secondary storyline involving Alison's sister. She is having marriage trouble and this gives the younger couple food for thought as they decide on what they want to do. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are good as the wife and husband. The supporting performances are also good with plenty of familiar faces such as Jonah Hill, Jason Siegl and Jay Baruchel"
"Bravesfan17","9","0","0","22 May 2010"," Apatow makes a funny movie with a good message
","Writer-director Judd Apatow has shown some brilliant work with his directing debut in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. His sophomoric work in Knocked Up trumps that as he shows how much he has progressed as a writer and director. He has shown some great directing in setting up the scene and have us get to know who these characters are and how they change.<br/><br/>We start out with Seth Rogen as Ben Stone, a guy who likes to hang out with his buddies, drink beer, and smoke crack. Apatow then shows us Katherine Heigl as Allison Scott, a high achieving E! employee who is moving up in the ranks and is asked to become a reporter. Both of our leads in Rogen and Heigl show us how brilliant they are at playing these polar opposite people. Rogen gives a breakthrough performance that made him famous. Heigl shows that she can do a leading comedic role and I find it hard to believe this role went through dozens of actresses before it landed on Heigl.<br/><br/>Ben's friends are a lot like him. They also like to get drunk, stoned, and are a fun-loving bunch. Allison's relatives are a lot like her in the sense that they are responsible.<br/><br/>Things come unglued when Ben and his friends are at a club the same night that Allison and her sister Debbie are there. Ben and Allison meet and hit it off. They enjoy a one night stand together and don't see each other for eight weeks. At this time we find out that Allison is pregnant with Ben's child.<br/><br/>This causes Ben to take an even greater interest in Allison and make him act more mature. He starts to make a crossover from being a stoner to being a responsible guy. Later, we find out that Ben hasn't been as responsible as we thought when we find out that Ben stashed away the books about going through life when expecting a baby. After a crazy weekend in Vegas, Ben decides to actually be responsible with his life and try to win back Allison. Ben moves out of the house from his buddies, gets a legitimate job, and reads the books so he knows what to expect with Allison. Allison takes him back, gives birth to a baby girl, and moves in with Ben.<br/><br/>Writer-director Judd Apatow knows how to make good heartfelt comedies with characters who we as an audience can relate to. I also like that despite the raunchiness and content of his movies, he can send out a good message. With Knocked Up, Apatow shows that any ordinary guy can get a hot girl."
"Squave","8","0","0","14 May 2010"," Entertaining and rewarding adult Rom-com
","Hilarious tale of the misadventures of an average Joe after a one night stand culminates in pregnancy, this is a major step forward from Apatow's directorial debut 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' in my opinion. More so than his closely related peers' the Farrelly brothers and Kevin Smith, Apatow walks the line between sentimentality and crudeness so easily he practically dances across it. It's about time films as R rated as this could be commercial successes. Although future performances have shown him to be slightly one-dimensional Seth Rogen stands out here as someone so average and lazy that he has been living off an insurance claim for five years. In a film where every support character steals most of the scenes they're in - Jason Segel being overly sleazy towards Leslie Mann, Jonah Hill getting pink eye, Craig Robinson declaring that Mann is 'Old as f**k' and Heigl is 'pregnant as f**k', as excuses for them being denied entry into a nightclub - it speaks volumes that we still remember Heigl and Rogen afterwards; Heigl propelling herself to the top of the Hollywood female Rom-com list. After the initial dent in the narrative equilibrium Apatow eases into what he does best in creating a very satisfying 'bromance' between Rogen and a superb Paul Rudd, the latter seemingly improving with each new role. This somewhat subtracts slightly from the central romance but nevertheless where the plot seems to stutter the laughs never do and ultimately most will be won over straight away or converted at some stage as the it heaves its way towards an amiable, if slightly predictable denouement."
"gsic_batou","8","0","0","5 April 2010"," The way comedies are
","In the land of Hollywood, good and worthwhile comedies seem hard to produce, but watching Appatow's serial comedy hits after resisting watching them for a long time makes me wonder why that is.<br/><br/>Appatow does comedies that have two things that seem simple enough to get: an working concept and character driven comedy. Not mindless gags of fart and sex(even tough they're also included), but instead a free for all tale of people that slide over a very earthly subject-in this case, unplanned pregnancy-with a light treatment where depression and pessimist will not have their way. Where the mood should be serious, Appatow takes it maturely in an amusing way. Where the mood should be goofy, he shocks us by making us realize there's more than just funny under the hood of his films. <br/><br/>Seth Rogen may look fat and hopeless in this movie, but Appatow will never let him be shrug of as a nuisance to be done with. Ever since ""Freaks and Geeks"" he shows us that everyone has problems, but no one has unique problems; he wants to tell us that we all swim in the same pool, even if at different depths in different times. For that alone, his movies will always be gold in my book."

","Knocked Up is a comedic film about two completely different people, one who has a promising future and the other with no future. Allison and Ben meet at a night club while Allison celebrates her promotion at one of the entertainment news reporters on E! After having a little too many drinks, they head back to Allison's sister's guest house and engage in sexual activities. Two months later, Allison found out that she is pregnant. After a visit at the doctors with Ben, the rest of the film shows over the next seven months of her pregnancy. The film also shows the relationship Allison and Ben build during her pregnancy.<br/><br/>The central idea of this film is to give anyone a chance. Allison never thought that she would ever date a guy like Ben. Ben didn't ever think that he could ever have a chance with her as well. This movie shows we must not judge people because they can change. <br/><br/>In Knocked Up, director Judd Apatow shows kids and babies' horrible side as well as their good side. The movie shows Allison's sister's daughters fighting and crying. Apatow shows how much of a pain kids can really be. I like how Ben changes his style more into the movie. He starts off looking like a bum and starts dressing cleaner. In the beginning, the movie shows the life of Ben and Allison. Ben sits around his house, smoking marijuana and partying, while Allison wakes up early and works all day. In the end, Ben changes his way of style. He gets a job, stops partying all the time, gets his own place, and he also dresses nicer. Ben realizes that he needs to grow up if he wants to be a good father."

Of course one can say that some well-off families have a couple of more children than average, but they are able to provide.<br/><br/>I'm from poor poor poor poor China.

"ptb-8","6","0","0","18 June 2009"," Knocked up in the edit suite
","Whilst watching this film I became increasingly aware of the bizarre editing. There seemed to be two different versions of the same film made and both edited together to make this one film. One version was a harder more verbally cruel one with anger-humor frat boy slacker (Sandler style) as a weapon and the other almost as a Drew Barrymore style comedy romance. It is as if both were filmed and then spliced together. I can see how neither tone or story angle worked so both were edited together to get this very uneven result. See the film again and then watch the out-takes and deleted scenes... there is material there that is both absurd and repulsive... and also explanatory (where Ben tells his flatmates he cannot live with them anymore, which is not in the final edited movie). Odd things just happen all through KNOCKED UP: There are whole scenes missing, linking scenes that explain why and how they are in the next scene. Ben just goes and rents an apartment; She has his picture on her work desk, as if he is some boyfriend when in the previous scenes she is exasperated with his sloppiness and person; suddenly they go spying on Paul Rudd and walk into a house somewhere... the intros of so many scenes have been chopped off and the viewer is abruptly halfway into another setting or tone or conversation without a smooth or logical segue-way into how or why they are there. Where is the scene where her mother actually meets him? The whole tone swings between vulgarity then really sooky romance then screaming rudeness, then shrewish selfishness, then everyone makes drag-queen style cracks at each other like some screwball comedy throwback (the Asian doctor for example) .. all inconsistent tone, direction editing and dialog. The gratuitous vulgarity and the extreme physical medical crudeness...the screaming subplot about the sister and her husband, the silly little girl rudeness etc... the argument in the car, it is all a jumble of different ideas and directing styles and writing. KNOCKED UP is a jigsaw puzzle edit of these films: ANIMAL HOUSE, MAYBE BABY, LOOK WHO'S TALKING, MONSTER IN LAW, BIG DADDY, American PIE, ROAD TRIP and any other US made crassness where humiliation and abuse is deemed funny. Howvere there is one genuinely inspired and hilarious scene in Las Vegas where Paul Rudd tries to explain why there are 5 different styles of chair in their room. It is as if someone else wrote and directed and edited in that scene too. Maybe KNOCKED UP was made by a committee. It looks and sounds as if it was."

","i have to say how much i enjoyed this film. i didn't expect to like it as much as i did. The title of the film suggests the type of over-the-top brainless, sexist film which conforms to all the clichéd ""porkys"" elements that came before it. But it's not. The film has a real subtle warmth about it. The leading performers all have a under-stated likability about them. I liked the improvised dialogue that Ben and his stoner friends used during their scenes, it gave each of their characters their own individuality, each being able to hold his/her own screen presence. I friend of mine said the film was completely sexist because if the the roles were reversed and it was a hot, successful guy who got a over-weight slacker girl pregnant the the film would be more like Fatal Attraction than an easy going comedy. I suppose there is a point to be made there but sometimes you should appreciate something for what it is. This is obviously no Citizen Kane and i don't think it's ever attempting to be, but likewise when you go to Burger King you don't expect french fries and caviar. To finish, this is not a laugh out loud comedy, however, if you've got a couple of hours to kill and you feel like watching something that makes you smile and forget that you live in rainy England for a while this picture is for you."

Having just attained a promotion, she decided to take her sister out to a night club to party the night out while having been both deranged and derailed in her thoughts out of drunkenness; she met a happy go lucky slacker  Ben Stone whose life achieving ambition is to create a website to advertise nude scenes of actors and actresses. He call that the Flesh of the Star, just so for your knowledge.<br/><br/>Having been high on alcohol, the both of them ended up on a casual one night stand without protection out of a misunderstanding (she actually meant, hurry up wearing the condom; rather than hurry up without the condom, but the phrase of hurrying up when tied alone is insufficient for a guy to interpret further at such an intensifying moment). And so it happens, and so the tadpole met its home and thenceforth we get a worrying Allison with the positive urine pregnancy test kits all over her room.<br/><br/>That was weeks after the one night stand and having discovered such through the embarrassing moments of nausea, vomiting and early morning sickness whilst at her job; she has no way out other than to call up the guy who is responsible for the baby creation. The news weren't that easy, and for slacker Ben, it's never casual to receive such a shocker. But he did! And the confirmation is true when he accompanied her to the obstetrician and gynaecologist for a detailed transvaginal ultrasonography. Ooh wala boom! There's the intrauterine gestational sac! Then there begins the responsibility, the heavy communication and the inter-relationship communication and conversation. The beginning of life full of need to dos, don'ts and quarrelling towards two differences takes on an interesting journey. As each individual from two totally different life prospects, professionalism and career meet at the crossroads, there are bound to be sacrifices, give and takes and as well as understanding. Allison lost her job, take on the prospect of being barred from the local entertainment pub, suffering from the upheavals of responsibilities of being a mother-to-be and having a rather irresponsible and selfish husband. Whilst Ben, out of all the new and sudden changes tries his best to adapt to a life that he never knew he would be drafted in, he could never, no matter what, seem to satisfy Allison.<br/><br/>The argument brought about so much attention towards the possibility of raising up the child by one parent's on and on the verge of divorce; but Ben is not without a heart. In showing that he really cared and want to take up the responsibility after being proved by Allison's sister on how big a loser he is, he took up all the baby books  read them, got ready for the much anticipated labor, argued constructively with her doctors who can be rather harsh and getting things organized when Allison progress into her final days of reaching labor. All of this sacrifices were of much value to Allison, to which she finally put on a smile and patted herself out of comfort and a sigh of relief  to which she believes that Stone is the guy, the rightful husband and the responsible father to share with for the rest of her life.<br/><br/>The outstanding comedy in both this immensely funny individuals can be very realistic and rather interesting. The story goes with the flow and the expected can be rather out of the blues. Out of all the commendation for the movies, it deserves its best remarks for it's another classical follower of its former 40-Year-Old Virgin."

","After getting a promotion at the TV station where she works, Alison (Heigl) celebrates and goes home with jobless Ben (Rogan) and is impregnated by him. Will she keep the baby, will she dump Ben, inquiring minds ask?<br/><br/>There are a lot of explicit sexual content, and F-bombs exploding all over the place and yet, the funny lines and actions do not come from any of that. I found them all to be offensive, embarrassing and annoying and the story would not have suffered if all of that were left out. No, the funny stuff comes from everything other than that. There are some good lines, good acting, and timely facial expressions that are the funny stuff. Okay, okay, when she is in the process of delivering the baby and having a hard time of it, there is a lot of anger, rudeness, crudeness and uninhibited language spewing forth from Alison and the scene was laugh-out-loud funny I have to admit. <br/><br/>This movie showcases Katherine Heigl's acting ranges as she goes through a myriad of emotions and all are quite believable and you care for her. If you didn't care for her then there is no point in watching the rest of the movie. Both Ben and Alison take the pregnancy seriously, but it is Alison that you care for and hope all turns out well for her. Ms Heigl is so beautiful that you are vaguely aware there are others in the scene as you cannot take your eyes off of her. And, this woman can act. Make no mistake about that. Yes, to some she is eye-candy. But eye-candy with a lot of acting talent. Oh, and she has a nice laugh too. <br/><br/>Now, why was this movie made? To let us see Ms Heigl in something other than Grey's Anatomy TV show, of course. Silly question.<br/><br/>Bad language and misguided sexual content aside, the performances of the rest of the cast were excellent. <br/><br/>Violence: No, Sex: Yes, Nudity: No, Language: Tons of it."

","I'm not a fan of most comedies. I love to laugh and I have a good subversive sense of humor, but most American comedies leave me especially cold. So I decided to read up on what the critics had to say about ""Knocked up."" They all loved it  overwhelmingly so! I was very disappointed! Not just in the movie but in the critics! Usually I can go to Rotten Tomatoes and agree with the average rating given by the dozens of America's critics. Maybe it's just a generational issue. I'm geriatric; old but not yet ancient. Maybe if I'd seen this when I was twenty or thirty I would have found it hilarious. Maybe most of the critics are young too; actually I'm sure they are. I really don't want to have to read AARP's movie reviews, because I know lots of old fogies who wouldn't be seen dead in movies I like. <br/><br/>What I discovered  too late  was that people over 45 gave this movie thumbs down. So I was right, it is a generational thing. Young people like to watch themselves and humanity portrayed as shallow; feckless; and amoral. Us older farts are bored to death by it. <br/><br/>Watching a movie about men permanently stuck in adolescence leaves me cold. It's the same with watching movies about drunks or drug addicts. What's funny about emotional retards? There's no pathos about pathetic people! The one organ that can get us to evolve is the Brain! Watching people abuse theirs sobers me right up, and that makes laughing hard! Watching a movie about a vibrant, gorgeous woman apparently not intelligent enough to know what her zillion other options were, other than to have sex with a Neanderthal  even when she's not seriously sh*t faced  and then to try and make it work with the moron set my teeth on edge! What's funny about stupidity?<br/><br/>But then this is the woman who plays ""Izzy"" on Greys anatomy, the one who fell in love with a terminally ill patient of hers, killed him off while trying to save him, and is now in the arms of the only married friend of hers! Not the sharpest morality wise!<br/><br/>Watching Kathy Heigl diminish her star quality in this way saddens me. It reminded me of Jane Seymour's embarrassing fling in ""Wedding Crashers."" She's young and she'll go on to better things  I hope."

","If this be nepotism, bring it on!

Alison is gorgeous, successful, with the relentless sheen Heigl has been radiating with unvaried artificiality in 61 episodes (so far) of ""Grey's Anatomy"" as Izzie Stevens.<br/><br/>So what do Ben and Alison have in common? The pregnancy referred to in the movie's indelicate title. The unhappy embryo brings together not only the two unlikely lovers, but also their respective, far-distant tribes. Ben's grossly juvenile would-be webmaster playmates and Alison's should-be proper family (Debbie & Co.) are squeezed together in a variety of ways. Yes, it's a non-starter basic plot, and the surprise is that the movie actually goes to some distance in search of some coherence.<br/><br/>Invariably linked with Apatow's ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" ""Knocked Up"" has mercifully less exaggerated physical comedy than the former, but the same sense of delight in the absurd, even if Apatow goes a long way at times to find it truthiness in the ludicrous. A big plus: mostly appealing (but realistic) characters, easy to care about, with their faults and warts and all.<br/><br/>The result is rather pleasant: a mostly funny, occasionally charming, steadily foul-mouthed, frequently well-written, otherwise downright stupid comedy, enjoyable in spite of its unaccountably overblown length of over two hours. It would have made a real good hour-long TV sitcom. Also, ""Knocked Up"" has a first-class score by Joe Henry and Loudon Wainwright III."

"barberoux","3","12","58","8 June 2007"," Distasteful
","""Knocked up"" had some funny moments and I laughed occasionally but I left the movie feeling very disenchanted. This is another California movie. It is all about this materialistic, drug ridden, shallow, selfish, youth obsessed, crude, rude and distasteful California lifestyle. I would not want to meet any of the people portrayed in this movie in real life. In fact I have to deal with this type in real life, the self-obsessed, cell phone gabbing, SUV driving bores. I think we are bombarded with this stereotype so often in the media that we start to believe that that is the way to be. I found the so-called adults in this movie to be immature and obsessed with instant gratification. If they didn't get what they want immediately then they had grounds to act crude and childish. Leslie Mann's character was distasteful. She was a foul mouthed child. Her husband, played by Paul Rudd, griped about not being able to do what he wanted so he was forced to lie to get some free time. Of course his free time meant dumping his kids on his wife. They lived in a sumptuous house and he drove a Mercedes sports car. Of course because of a spat he had to take off to Las Vegas with Ben to cavort with strippers and indulge in psychedelic mushrooms. Did they have any appreciation for their lifestyle? No. I saw them being angry at not being instantly gratified and entertained. Really how many of the audience would have the time or money to indulge in this behavior. My neighbor works two jobs and struggles to send his children to State Colleges. I don't see him portrayed in California movies. Katherine Heigl played her role well but her character's success was based not on talent or hard work but on her good looks. How Californian. Seth Rogen's character was crude, crude, crude. He played it well. I could almost smell his character's acrid body odor. This movie will be a hit with the lucrative 18 to 25 crowd. That is a scary thought that this portrayal of boorish, self-involvement would resonate with a group of people. I noted that more drug related killings happened in Philadelphia recently. Drugs and the violence they breed are a problem because there is a ready market for the product and lots of money can be made from it. This movie glorified drug use. Is there no social consciousness? Do we rate social consciousness by how much the box office pulls in this weekend? I wasn't alone in my dislike. People got up and walked out on this movie. I go to see movies often and it is rare to see people disgusted enough to walk out. This was a morally objectionable movie."

","As with ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" I thought ""Knocked Up"" was funny and a I had a good time with it, but it didn't warrant the rapturous response it has received from critics, or the inexplicably high rating it has received here at IMDb.<br/><br/>Frankly, the joke about adult men refusing to grow up has worn thin, and not much more comic mileage can be squeezed from it. Also, it's a shame that a movie people are congratulating for its frankness and candidness doesn't have the balls to treat pregnancy the way it really is. It would have been nice in a movie about the beautiful act of bringing a child into the world for the filmmakers to extend that idea of beauty to the woman's body in pregnancy, but instead we have a gorgeous actress who never once convincingly looks, moves or acts like a pregnant woman, and who even looks gorgeous while she's in the middle of delivery no less.<br/><br/>But, when you consider the typical Hollywood comedy being churned out these days, many of which I saw previews for when I went to see this film, you can understand why a movie like this, that has sharp acting and writing, and whose laughs come from well-delivered lines and good timing rather than juvenile pratfalls and fart jokes, is blowing like a fresh breeze through our summer movie theatres.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"Quinoa1984","9","3","9","6 June 2007"," a guide to having a baby, with stoners, and E! news
","My first reaction at the end of the film was probably too simplistic a comparison: Harold and Kumar meets Nine Months (yes, the Hugh Grant/Julianne Moore pregnancy comedy from 95). But the film actually carries off how so few romantic comedies know how- to actually give us a man and a woman to actually give a damn about. More than that, Apatow has matched extraordinarily well the shlubby but funny and down-to-earth skills of Seth Rogan with the vibrant, uncertain but ultimately believably conflicted personality in Katherine Heigl. It's a tough sell with it's premise, to be sure, that a very attractive E! news reporter like Allison (Heigl) and a total stoner almost-bum like Ben (Rogan) could hook up over less than 12 hours and suddenly procreate, but there you have it. It's a premise that actually had me avoiding the film, even with the immense hype from critics as well as friends and family, because the footage shown in the trailer didn't seem to be that much to write home about.<br/><br/>The actual finished product, however, is certainly the funniest American movie out so far in 2007, pointed at the age variant of around 18 to, um, 37 maybe, with all of the supporting characters, as well as Rogan and co-star Paul Rudd as Heigel's brother-in-law via sister played by Leslie Mann, very sharp with levels of sarcastic wit and pop-culture references. At the same time Apatow gets some really amazing one-liners regarding Ben's friends joking on each other (the bearded guy provides the most fodder, but the general attitude is 'hey, f*** it, lets get stoned""), but doesn't lose track of what he's trying to do, successfully. He's out to criticize as well as embrace a culture where responsibility for one's self has to do with how the other in the relationship is comfortable or dissatisfied with the other. And Apatow makes the Rudd/Mann relationship a kind of bittersweet (much more bitter really) counterpoint to the rocky start to Ben and Allison's 'shot-gun' romance.<br/><br/>There's silly one liners (""I live in your phone!""), goofy caricatures (the gynecologists), smart aleck kids who know a lot of ""bad"" words that provides for some wicked laughs, and the usual mayhem in the delivery room an actual winner in terms of making it partly true and partly farce (albeit Judd doesn't seem to understand, despite having three kids, what a woman is like *throughout* the labor process, as reconciliations don't usually happen aside from script contrivances). Yet all the while, it's a sincere film, with the relationships shown not as cardboard cut-outs but where the people actually have to deal, if eventually, with the lots in life they've got themselves into. What is it to balance love and commitment, Apatow is asking. There's even one shot that provides a note of discomfort with the characters of Ben and Allison as they have a bad argument in the car, the view being outside of the car in traffic, a distance kept because, and it's a credit to Apatow as a storyteller, we do care about what will happen in this situation.<br/><br/>In fact, that's probably one of the best things to say about Knocked Up. Too often in movies, especially of the cineplex fare, the situation is more-so told than an actual story. This is one of those rare cases where the situation, a tricky one to surpass as it's been done (the 'situation' of pregnancy, not so much the one-nite-stand part), unfolds more as a story, and by the time the 'happy' ending comes, it's not a cop-out or cheat. And this goes without saying that the actors, as well as the filmmaker, are totally assured with their comic skills, be they subtle (the dazed look of the bearded ""Martin Scorsese on cocaine"" friend, even Rudd to a degree can be staggeringly subtle), or big (the ""second"" sex scene between the main couple). Quite simply, it's THE rom-com sleeper of the past few years."

It almost seemed like 2007 would be THE best year for movies and that those three would be the perfect evidence. Instead, most people walked away from those movies sour and found more entertainment in Disturbia, a less-than 2 hour somewhat corny thriller.<br/><br/>Now enter Knocked Up, the next movie by the guys that brought you The 40-Year Old Virgin. The story behind the movie isn't anything new, a stoner gets a hard-working hottie pregnant and they need to work things out. But don't let that (or the disappointments this year for that matter) fool you, because Knocked Up is unquestionably the first indefinitely ""good"" movie so far this year.<br/><br/>Why does Knocked Up actually work? Well, part of it has to do with how easily accessible it is. If you're a guy that loves the outrageous comedies and has a girl that's all over the ""chick flicks"" or vice versa, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this movie. The style of the movie is like a mix between Liar Liar's lesson of responsibility and The 40-Year Old Virgin's outrageous and totally irresistible comedy. In other words, it's an insane comedy with a great heart.<br/><br/>Knocked Up is a movie that you don't need to speak much about to really emphasize how great it is. All that one really needs to know is that it's a comedy mixed with some romance that works quite well. About the only thing the movie doesn't do well is the length, it's running time is noticeably longer than other comedies. But you know what? What's wrong with a few more laughs, honestly? If the first batch of movies have been 2007's disappointments, then Knocked Up is 2007's redemption."

There should be an icon on the bottom right of the screen telling you when to laugh. American comedies are poorly written, usually abandoning what little comedy they do have for a sentimental ending.

Knocked up is no exception- is it funny? no. original? no. well written? no sir! another dull American film that relies heavily on toilet humour (which anyone with no talent could write).

However two months later and Alison is throwing up much more than she used to and finding she is pregnant decides it only right to get in touch with the man totally unprepared for the news that he is to be a father.<br/><br/>Hearing about this at the time of release you would have thought that it was the second coming of the Messiah. I was in New York during its run in theatres there and could not avoid posters hailing it the film of the year and the hype continued when it arrived in the UK. Not really being into teen comedies, I sort of dismissed it and moved on. When it hit DVD I decided to give it a try and found something that is not totally worthy of the hype it received but certainly better than the crude teen sex comedy that I had the image of it being. What it actually is is a pretty natural and engaging comedy based around people who are, if not ""real"" then at least recognisable. The dialogue is quite snappy and the comedy mostly avoids being broad or crude and on the contrary manages to be really well observed at times (the rather bitter woman in Alison's manager's office being a favourite of me and my partner).<br/><br/>The characters do help and for some will be really recognisable. I don't really know people like any of them but the feelings and actions mostly feel genuine and real to me and I did care about them to sufficient extent that my interest was maintained even when laughs were not to be had for a bit. Speaking of genuine actions though, the one thing I would say that struck a sour note was the rather strange moral decisions taken where two people stumble into this relationship due to the child. I appreciate that it is not a subject for this film so much as a plot device to set up the story but it still didn't ring true to me and wasn't helped by seeing the topic being handled much better in Juno (where it was also not a big political message either). That said Apatow's script does bring out valid themes and it is these that see the film be convincing and feel quite real. Dissatisfaction in long-term relationships, fears, worries, the passing of youth etc are all there to be seen within the characters and, while not a searing comment, the film is smart and natural with it.<br/><br/>The cast mostly respond well to this although it is clear that the vast majority work best with the comedy material. Rogen is not totally up to the task of leading a film, but he is funny if nothing else. In the more demanding aspects of the role? Well, I'm not totally sure. Heigl is charming and beautiful but almost to the point where the central relationship is made less convincing. I would have preferred a less stunning actress in the role as it would have covered for the lack of doubt in her character and also been more interesting in regards Ben's choices. Anyway, she is quite amusing and she is more comfortable in the more dramatic moments in the film. Mann is OK but Rudd is better. The support cast of stoners etc are mostly funny but my favourite turn is from Wiig who is wonderfully bad at concealing her tired bitterness while also going along with the bosses to keep her job.<br/><br/>Overall then, Knocked Up is an enjoyable and fresh comedy that is funny while also having natural characters that I either cared about or recognised enough to be interested in. Not totally convinced by the fudged morality of the film or the way the central relationship goes but Apatow's script is funny and interesting enough to cover up for the weaknesses he has also created. Don't believe the hype but it is still fun."
"khemass","9","2","5","1 February 2008"," Entertaining and not too far from reality
","I want to comment on two things. First about the film and then about what it makes me think.<br/><br/>OK,this film is fun. It makes me laugh and smile. The performances of the lead actor and actress are enjoyable to watch. I think they cast just the right people, especially the guy who plays Ben. I think overall he really looks like bum but his eyes reflect kindness, just perfect for the role. The film may have been flawed and irritating a few times, but overall this is something of a good work. The story may sound a bit unbelievable, but if you're a little positive on people and believe that among those whose life are crap like Ben can be someone who has a heart, love his own child, and want to learn to be a better person, then it works. Anothing that makes me feel this movie is not too far from reality is that they never present Ben and Alison as easy relationship. They have a lot to work on and probably a lot more ahead after their baby was born. This is true for all couples.<br/><br/>This film makes me think. At first when Alison realized she was pregnant and she decided to call Ben, I was thinking to myself that if I was her, I wouldn't even think about that. How can you expect someone who looks like a total failure,jobless, pervert,and doesn't seem to take any responsibility in his life to be a father of your child? But then as the story moves on, I came to think, what if he's not all that bad. What if deep down inside that someone you think it's a total flop, there lies a boy who wants to grow up and be a better person. It's maybe worth the risk to give him a chance. At least your baby can be with the real father. Another thing I learn was, maybe guys really have to be told what to do. Maybe there're things that we women can't expect them to just know it and do it without asking.<br/><br/>Well, but I'm not sure if I'm being too positive about guys or not, hehe! Anyway, this film is a delight. I wasn't disappointed at all."

While they start an relationship, which they try to make it work before the baby is born.<br/><br/>Written and Directed by Judd Apatow (The 40 Year Old Virgin) made an enjoyable, tasteless comedy but with a heart and soul. Rogen gives an excellent comedic lead performance in this film. Which he also one of the two executive producers of this movie. Which it was one of the most popular comedies of this summer. Heigl is quite good as well, which Anna Hathaway was originally cast as Alison until she backed up in the last minute. Originally this film was supposed to be an followed up to ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" with following the supporting characters from the picture. Since that didn't work, Apatow manages to make this movie original in its storytelling.<br/><br/>The Single Disc DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an funny commentary track by writer/director Apatow, actor/executive producer Rogan and actor Bill Hader. DVD also Deleted Scenes, Extended Scenes, Outtakes and more. The cast is first rate in the film, every character do have comedic moments as well. Mann (Who's married to the director and as well her two real-life kids are in the picture) steals the show as the supportive, over-worried older sister. Apatow's script is original, fresh, funny and even vulgar but it's works surprisingly well for an adult comedy. Rogen is going to be an big comedic star soon, i would love to see him more in lead characters as well. Many celebrities appears in unbilled cameos. Harold Ramis has good funny moments in his cameo as Ben's father. Also available in a Two-Disc Collector's Edition. (****/*****)."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","5","26 August 2007"," Hailed by the English-speaking world on both sides of the Atlantic, this movie could be the best romance-comedy of 2007
","A story about childbirth is almost a guaranteed hit, unless it is hopelessly bungled up. No matter how many time you have seen it, the wonders and warmth of a childbirth scene never fails to bring a lump to your throat. Judd Apatow, who penned and directed the immensely successful hit ""The 40 year old virgin"", is too good a screenwriter and director to bungle up this one. ""Knocked up"", following the footsteps of ""virgin"", becomes the sleeper romance-comedy hit of this summer, receiving overwhelming applause from the English speaking world on both sides of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Despite its crude title and raunchy opening, ""Knocked up"" touches and amuses at the right moments. The storyline is simplicity itself: a one-night stand giving rise to an unexpected pregnancy leads towards a relationship that survives trails and blossoms into a happy ending, brought about by a surefire childbirth scene. End of story.<br/><br/>The relatively unknown cast (to the big screen, at least), drawn mainly from popular TV stars as well as ""The 40 year old virgin"", ranges from likable to lovable. While theirs may not be household names in an average moviegoer's household (if they don't watch much TV), these actor perform. Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen play the unlikely couple Alison and Ben, she an up-and-rising young TV professional just promoted to host celebrity interviews (including Steve Carell, star of ""40 year old virgin"" in a cameo appearance), and he a good-for-nothing dud stuck with a bunch of losers and half-freaks in a stupid Internet project they've dreamed up. The usual sidekick couple Debbie (Alison's sister) and her husband Pete are played by Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd who are so good (particularly Mann) that they carry their own story of an outwardly model couple who nevertheless have their own problems. Ben's bunch provides the expected smutty humour. There is also a huge cast of excellent supporting actors. Harold Ramis plays Ben's father, with the ""wise old man"" persona. Real-life daughters of Apatow and Mann, Iris and Maude Apatow, play the little daughters of Pete and Debbie in the movie. The older one (Iris Apatow, I presume) steals a few scenes, particularly the one with her reaction when informed that prick means penis. Contributing to the grand finale scene in the delivery room is the portrayal of the delivery doctor by Ken Jeong who is an MD in real life, as well as a comedy actor, both stage and screen.<br/><br/>One critic sums this movie up best, by saying that this movie made him laugh, almost cry and, above all, made him happy."
"oneloveall","7","2","5","1 June 2007"," Judd Apatow continues to improve his distinct style with the most consistent comedy of the season
","From the hilarious writer-director-oddball Judd Apatow, Knocked Up one-ups even his extremely well received 40 Year Old Virgin. And just like last year's funniest surprise hit, his latest release seems destined to repeat the same critically and commercially successful process. Apatow continues to triumph, like few working American filmmakers today, by merging vulgarity with sincerity into equally hilarious and heartfelt results. In detailing the warped and awkwardly circumstantial paining of Seth Rogen's quintessential slacker and Katherine Heigl's ambitious businesswoman (both casted well), Apatow's trademark bittersweet dynamics get to shine brighter even then anything we have previously seen.<br/><br/>What works so well for the film, besides it's constant and perceptive humor, is how well both sexes are covered in this gross-out comedy with heart. If The 40 Year Old Virgin was a great comedy with romantic intentions, Knocked Up is a romantic movie with comedic intentions. Despite his preoccupation with bodily gags and stereotypical stoners, Apatow has truly been refining the emotional content of his characters, coming up with two people who are a pleasure to invest into the relationship despite a plethora of disgusting toilet humor emanating from much of the dialog.<br/><br/>What results is a movie that functions nearly as well as an offbeat chick flick or the masterful comedy that it is. The screenplay may push a little too hard with crude sexual references at times, though it often compliments the heavier romantic qualities splendidly. Of course the plot will have it's fair share of unrealistic qualities (even if Apatow does vividly capture some very real qualities from the demographic he writes about he still struggles with the female psyche), and some may resent Apatow's continuous decision to load his last act up with a heavier dosage of drama then the overall tone would suggest, but line for line Knocked Up is surely the funniest script to emerge on the big screen this year, and this year's champion of the one-liner zing."

First it was unnecessary to show Heigel's fake vagina with a baby coming out. Second, I see that nepotism is alive and well with him putting his two little girls in the movie. Third, there's an interesting (yet totally irrelevant) scene of Heigel and Mann trying to get into a club by ignoring the line and getting put down for it. In the end the director wimps out and apologizes for the snub. Naturally at the end of the movie a baby gets born and everything is all right with the world. Give me a break!

","(My Synopsis) Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) has just been promoted to an on-camera interviewer job for E! (Entertainment Channel). That night, she goes out with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) to celebrate and party at a trendy nightclub. At the bar, Allison meets Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) who buys her some drinks. Allison and Ben with the addition of a lot of drinks make a connection at the nightclub. They end up spending the night together. The next morning reality hits; Allison is an up-and-coming entertainment journalist, and Ben is an overweight immature unemployed pot-head slacker. They part their separate ways never to meet again; however, circumstances bring them together eight weeks later. Allison must tell Ben that she is pregnant and that he is the father. Ben's first thought is to hit the road and go back home to Canada, but instead he becomes supportive and wants to help Allison. Little do they know what they are getting into! <br/><br/>(My Comment) This is a very funny movie, although the humor is crude and rough, and definitely not for children. The movie has an abundance of one-liners that kept the audience and me laughing throughout the whole movie. I haven't laughed out loud so much at a movie in a long time. This is a simple story of what can happen by accident one night that can change your life permanently. The script has a lot of great laughs by exploring the realities of casual sex, marriage, commitment, money, a job, and drugs. The film's conclusion may be a little unrealistic, but it does show that accidents do happen, and people try to do their best to make their new life connection manageable, especially, when a child is involved. Stay and see the closing credits, because they are filled with childhood photos of the cast and crew. I want to repeat that this is not a movie for children, because there is a lot of cursing and some nude scenes. (Universal Pictures, Run time 2:09, Rated R)(8/10)"

","Because of this movie's connection with the 40 Year Old Virgin, I guess I was expecting more. Leaving the 40YOV, my stomach hurt from laughing so hard. This movie produced a few chuckles and that was about it. It was a disappointment. When a movie is billed a s a comedy, I think that it should be able to produce more than a few chuckles throughout its length. The premise was quite good and was fertile, pardon the pun, ground that was not plowed to perfection, thereby producing a weak crop. The movie was cute, and not a total loss by any means, and I did not feel as if I had been ripped off but it just did not produce what it should have. A great opportunity for a great comedy was there but the catch was not made."

","Is this the latest strategy for movie makers to squeeze money out of their vulnerable viewers: write a screenplay that is so funny that as you're laughing, you miss the next joke, forcing you to see the movie twice? Do the makers of this movie realize that movie admission is now beyond $9? That means, in order to catch all the jokes, I have to see Knocked Up a second time. And what happens if I again laugh at the A jokes, missing the B jokes? I could end up spending not $18, but $27 to enjoy just one film. Maybe I should bring a damp towel to the theater and press it tightly against my mouth so I don't make that horsey sound that I call a laugh. Will theater owners allow me to bring in ""outside"" towels? What a conundrum this movie has left me...in."

","I enjoyed this movie. But I found the story much grittier, more graphic in language and in visual effects, than I had anticipated. There is very little foul language in the film, not enough to notice. But the pranks the roommates play, the way the pregnancy and delivery are depicted and described, go beyond the polite or even descriptive language I am used to, and detracted a bit from a good story. I found Ben's transformation to a good father prospect, and the sudden acceptance of Ben and Allison setting up a home to be abrupt and poorly motivated. There is no secret what the plot for the movie is. The storyline is predictable with the predictable plot complications in the expected places. The beauty and value of the story is in the telling. And that is done pretty well. I laughed a lot more after leaving the theater than I did during the movie. The story is pretty kind, has a lot of good moments, and the making of the movie has some interesting quirks. I enjoyed the movie a lot, but it wasn't comfortable for me."

The story, so simple, and yet so complex, is well put together, the characters are all believable and lovable even if they're far from Hollywood perfect (thank God!)<br/><br/>The script sounds real, and the characters actually have something relevant to say every time they open their mouths. Which brings me to the much debated ""vulgarity"" of the movie, which, in my opinion, had a point. And its point was to give shape to a bunch of characters who were, well, far from English aristocrats. Hence the language.<br/><br/>But the best part of the movie for me was how all the characters evolved, how they all changed, each in their own distinctive way, how they responded to the challenges they met.

Katherine Heigl plays Alison Scott, a seemingly successful news reporter who has everything - Attention, beauty and brains. A perfect life it seems, but all of it came crashing down after having a one night stand with goof ball Ben Stone played by real life funny man Seth Rogen. Knocked Up will take you through the ups and the downs of Alison's pregnancy and how two vastly different people who are 'thrust' together by circumstance can actually turn out to be the one for one another.<br/><br/>A common misconception people have for the movie is that its just crude comedy. Which is probably why many people may be disappointed or taken aback by what this movie brings forth instead. However, I for one am pleasantly surprised. The movie actually encompasses realism in its storyline along with its crude but funny humor. It shocked me with the strength of the plot.

","So, I'll start by saying it was no 40-Year-Old Virgin. I had truly high hopes for this movie because the aforementioned movie was hysterical (I now own it) and I love Paul Rudd with a firey passion. This movie disappointed me for a couple of reasons: One, I think the editors could have removed 45 minutes of running time without depriving the audience of one significant joke or plot detail.<br/><br/>Two, unlike ""Virgin,"" there was not a lot of comfortable humor. The majority of my laughs were the product of being so immensely uncomfortable with the on screen conversations or images that I knew not what else to do but emit a nervous, God-make-it-stop giggle that barely functioned to ease my pain. I think I laughed mostly because I *wanted* it to be a comedy, but in fact it's really more serious than the trailers make it out to be. I remember getting a similar feeling while watching The Break Up (Vince Vaughan and Jennifer Aniston)--that some of the ""jokes"" were just a little too-close-to-home to take as light-heartedly as the filmmakers seemed to insinuate they should be taken. Like: Here's the worst possible situation that could ever happen to you--isn't that FUNNY?! And you're sitting in the theatre thinking, ""Um, not really--but I'll laugh so I don't feel like I just wasted ten bucks."" I'm not saying that the movie has nothing to recommend it--I'm just saying that it is at times fairly painful to watch. Enjoy :D"

","This is a great comedy film from the Apatow camp. Knocked up is silly, offensive and yet romantic. For Knocked Up, writer/director Judd Apatow's sophomore feature, the filmmaker has elected to follow pretty much the same formula that made his debut, The 40 Year Old Virgin, such a success. Considering how winning the formula is, it's a safe approach. The often ribald humor is genuinely funny. The characters are endearing and very well played by Seth Rogen(Who is right at home here in this material) and Katherine Heigl. And there's something warm and sweet about the underlying storyline. Apatow is clearly a romantic, even if there's a profane edge to his ""love conquers all"" worldview. Other filmmakers embarking into the comedy minefield could learn a thing or two from him."

","Knocked Up (2007): Dir: Judd Apatow / Cast: Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, Harold Ramis: Few directors can strike gold twice but Judd Apatow is one of few. He previously made the hilarious The 40 Year Old Virgin, an observant comedy about sex introduction. Now here he is with the aftermath of sex and another comic masterpiece. Katherine Heigl stars as a young woman promoted to on camera at a news facility but upon celebrating at a nightclub she meets an irresponsible pot smoking party animal played by Seth Rogen. A night of passion leads to pregnancy and the totally altering of lifestyles. Director Judd Apatow is observant in themes of change and adaptation. Heigl is strong as a woman growing too fast yet accepting the challenge of motherhood. Rogen plays off someone torn between responsibility and carefree. Leslie Mann plays Heigl's older sister who struggles in her marriage to Paul Rudd. She gives Heigl advice that is met with scorn in the face of Rogen's lifestyle and whether or not he is fit for fatherhood. Rudd is reclusive in that Mann makes the decisions and he basically tells Rogen about his routine. Harold Ramis is perfect casting as Rogen's father who offers advice during a crucial heart to heart scene. Hilarious view of unplanned pregnancies resulting in a comedy that gets knocked up to the best films of the year. Score: 10 / 10"

","""Knocked Up"" is a movie which has to dot with a man who is a party animal and he goes from party to party. The only thing that he never thought is a baby and a woman who got pregnant by him. In this movie we watch this party animal trying to survive by this woman who after eight weeks showed up in his doorstep to tell him that she was pregnant by him in a party in which he went.<br/><br/>I did not like this movie as much as I expected but I have to admit that the whole plot and storyline was nice. The direction of Judd Apatow for one more time was not enough to make this movie a little better but the interpretations of Seth Rogen's who plays as Ben Stone the party animal was outstanding and Katherine Heigl's who plays as Alison Scott the pregnant woman was equally nice.<br/><br/>Although I have to tell you that ""Knocked Up"" is a funny movie to watch and spare your time but nothing more than this."

","This film is about a successful TV presenter who gets pregnant after a drunken one night stand.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" tells a story that a lot of people fear, and a lot of people can relate to. The two individuals in the spotlight are very incompatible with each other, and yet they try to be in a relationship for the sake of the unborn baby. The film s funny at times, but most of the time the five pot heads are far too annoying to be entertaining. Watching them acting irresponsibly like spoiled teenagers is not my idea of comedy.<br/><br/>I cannot help compare ""Knocked Up"" with ""This Is 40"", which is the sequel of this. I found ""This Is 40"" funny but fragmented; ""Knocked Up"" is cohesive but not so funny. I think it is over-hyped. If it wasn't for Katherine Heigl's charm and Leslie Mann's attitude, ""Knocked Up"" would have been a bore."

","That's it. I don't mind the vulgarity. The vulgar words are not the problem, it's the rest of the words in the script that suck. The acting was as good as it could have been with such unnatural dialogue. I'm a fan if Seth and the rest of the cast, I think they're some of the funniest people in Hollywood, but there's only so much you can do with a good cast. If the director had some balls he would have let them improvise at least a little bit. The story is OK as a whole, but if you look into the characters they feel plastic and unrealistic, from the stoner stereotypes, to the weird attraction between two characters that really didn't express any sort of connection. It all felt like an alien of some kind saw a bunch of romcoms and thought ""I could do that"". The worst part of it is the humour, or rather lack there of. I laughed maybe 3 times and not that hard either. The jokes sound like third rate stand up. What the f$#k was with the Stephen Hawking joke!? It's not a comedy, it just isn't and it's very far from a stoner comedy too."

","I had real high hopes for Knocked up and I was little disappointed in the result. The movie is pretty good but its not all that. I thought it could have been much more funnier and entertaining. It was very boring at certain points. It was more focused on real life and drama then a straight up comedy. The title of the film suggests the type of over-the-top brainless, sexist film which conforms to all the clichéd elements that came before it. But it's not. The film has a real subtle warmth about it. The leading performers all have a under-stated likability about them. I liked the improvised dialogue that Ben and his stoner friends used during their scenes, it gave each of their characters their own individuality, each being able to hold his/her own screen presence. I suppose there is a point to be made there but sometimes you should appreciate something for what it is. To finish, this is not a laugh out loud comedy, however, if you've got a couple of hours to kill and you feel like watching something that makes you smile and forget that you live in rainy England for a while this picture is for you. There were many funny scenes and also boring scenes<br/><br/>==================================================================== ====================================================================<br/><br/>As a rewatch 08/05/17' Knocked Up is quite a much better film on another viewing. This film has lived up and has aged well. The jokes are more well thought and clever, and the performance by Seth Rogen was arguably his star turning moment. Although the leading women were unlikable, the rest of the cast make up for it. great comedy that has all the effects of a proper Apatow production. Rating changed from 6 to 8."
"cannonclubonline","7","1","2","28 June 2010"," Apatow Takes Realism To The Limits & Brings It Back
","Let's just say for all intents and practical purposes you are totally bored with real stupid comedy and you've watched up all your soap operas. Where do you soon turn? Of course, where else will most agreeably turn when everything else fails? The DVD Comedy Section! Judd Apatow takes his views on life, love, and comedy very seriously. So seriously that he continues to pour out film after film of hilarious uncharted territory we all can not seem to get enough of.<br/><br/>Like most films Apatow produces, we learn to expect a different kind of experience. Apatow normally, if not mostly, likes to push the envelope as far as possible on what the audience perceives as either plain stupid, ignorant, gross, profane, incoherent, embarrassing, in your face, or unacceptable when it comes to embracing the current common societal views on decency. Apatow somehow is able to walk this thin line in his films without totally alienating most people. The common thread in most all of his films seems to revolve around characters that we somehow would love to hate, however, can't seem to ever get to that point. We always conditionally forgive these people regardless of how they act. Most of the characters tend to always redeem themselves with us before the film ends.<br/><br/>The common fallacy we might make when trying to explain a film to someone who hasn't seen it before is saying something like, ""Hey man! Have you seen that film called Knocked Up? That was totally awesome!"". Of course when the person, that doesn't really understand that you are a film expert film buff, goes home and watches it, then they might never listen to another one of your opinions again. Mostly, the film as with any film, either has a shelf life (i.e. A life of its own or it doesn't).<br/><br/>My opinion is meaningless when it comes to judging a comedy. We just have to see if it's going to be a long-term forgettable film like ""Flashdance"", or something else. I'm certainly not knocking the directing talent of Adrian Lyne or Don Simpson as a producer, but there is so far a film can carry you after 30 years. For instance, I can only remember the gal (Jennifer Beals), I thought I would never see again in another film, and the Michael Simbelo ""Maniac"" song. I'm certainly glad the Jennifer Beals didn't just disappear from the scene, but she has hardly starred in another major role in her acting career. Jennifer is definitely still holding her own and looking better than ever, which is a miracle. She is only about 6 months younger than me, and my body looks like it's been trampled by a herd of hippos. I'm just saying, in trying to pinpoint a single formula that makes Apatow's films so very memorable, you'll just have to go back and watch it 20 years later. That's the most important litmus test for the next generation of comedy analyzers.<br/><br/>Some say that the inner sanctum of loving a film is loving the main character. Seth Rogen is definitely fun and delivers us the most astonishing silliness one could ever imagine. Ben Stone is a likable guy who could just as well be your best friend or cousin. Bad behavior is expected along the way and Rogen as Stone delivers it up as best he knows how. Simply put, you actually feel sorrow for this green and pitiful idiot who has no clue how he has screwed his life up. Instead of taking us down an even more pitiful story-line, Apatow shows us that even this guy can make good decisions and turn his life around. Cheers to everyone who made Knocked Up!!!"

","Disclaimer: Since this is a romantic comedy, I am probably not part of its intended audience. In fact, this is a movie I would not have picked to watch, except that I heard Loudon Wainwright III did the music and I wanted to know what kind of music the ""Dead Skunk"" guy would do for a movie.<br/><br/>Having said that, I feel that the makers of this movie should have thought more about what their intended audience would and wouldn't want. This definitely follows the formula for a romantic comedy, which would mean it was aimed at women, right? But there is a lot of extremely crude humor and extremely heavyweight profanity here, and at the risk of sounding sexist, I'm guessing a lot of women would be put of by this. So maybe this isn't supposed to be a chick flick after all?<br/><br/>BTW, in addition to doing the music, Wainwright also has a cameo role."
"Quebec_Dragon","7","1","2","11 June 2009"," Didn't knock it out of the park but was amusing enough
","Say what you will about writer/director Judd Apatow but beyond the raunchy, crude and drug humor usually seen in his comedies, there's usually also a lot of heart and honesty. That guy might even be a closet romantic for all we know. I didn't like ""Knocked up"" as much as his other efforts (40 year-old virgin, Superbad, etc) but I did have a good time watching it. I found it often amusing but rarely hilarious. The premise of a poor overweight average-looking slacker impregnating the hot ambitious successful blonde could be material for lots of dumb easy jokes but it does manage to make the average guy (Seth Rogen) likable in an earnest childish way and we do see how the blonde (Katherine Heigl) in question might not dismiss him right out the bat. This being an American comedy, I kind of expected abortion not to be brought up at all but I was pleasantly surprised at how tastefully it was talked about. The humor does rely on clever dialog and the differences between this ill-assorted pair, more specifically on how unsophisticated and irresponsible Seth Rogen seems to be. In one of the funniest scenes, he explains what he does for a living in a totally honest non self-conscious way while the audience and the blonde roll their eyes.<br/><br/>Seth's character also has a bunch of slacker roommates who do help raise the raunchy pop-culture humor level. However, as much as I liked the running joke with the beard, I thought 2 of the friends in question (the bearded guy and the mustache guy) lacked on-screen presence and charisma (although I know they're not supposed to be charismatic). Heigl in the leading female role was natural and charming playing as the straight (wo)man role to Rogen's funny man. The chemistry between them was good and I did enjoy their character development. The women (thinking specifically of Heigl's sister here) might seem like prudish snobbish killjoys but I think it contrasts well with the immature fun-loving boys and does add a certain dramatic element and insight on modern men-women relationships. There were some complaints that the film was sexist towards women but really I would argue it's the guys who are not portrayed flatteringly. Weirdly, this movie is a paradox: a somewhat moral honest modern ""romantic"" comedy hidden under a raunchy immature slacker comedy.<br/><br/>Rating: 6.5 out of 10"
"mdickson001","Null","1","2","27 April 2009"," The film shows that love is capable of crossing all boundaries.
","The central theme of the film is that opposites attract. Even though two people can be different in so many ways, love has way of making ones partners annoying habits their own. Ben and Allison are as different as night and day, but they still manage to fall in love. Debbie, the older sister of Allison is not necessarily compatible with her husband Pete because he always finds ways to escape their home life. Allison meets Ben in a club after her and her sister Debbie decides to have a night on the town. Allison, overly drunk decides to invite Ben back to her home for a night cap. In the scenes at the bar the director uses a subjective point of view as the alcohol that Allison and Ben have consumed begins to<br/><br/>affect them. A casual meeting between Allison and Ben at the bar turns into a lust filled evening rather quickly.<br/><br/>After Ben and Allison awake in the morning after the club ordeal, Allison realizes the error of her ways and decides that she made a terrible mistake sleeping with Ben. Weeks later, Allison discovers that she is pregnant with Ben's baby. In the scenes leading up to Allison's discovery that she is pregnant the director uses a flash forward to jump ahead in time a few weeks. The primary plot of the movie is that<br/><br/>two total opposites unintentionally make a child and fall in love in the process. Another plot of the movie was watching Ben grow up in front of his friends. In the beginning of the film, Ben and his friends were all alcoholics and pot smokers. The scene in the hospital where Ben's friends appeared concerned about Ben and the baby's well being, the director uses an objective point of view. The hospital scene<br/><br/>signaled a turning point in the way Ben's friends viewed life. The movie ""Baby Mama"" is similar to the film ""Knocked Up"" because its storyline is about pregnancy, falling in love and growing up in the process. An excellent motif in the film would be the fact that both Ben and Martin (Debbie's) husband were both womanizers in the scenes they were in together. This motif was relevant to the theme because even though Ben and Martin were both Womanizers in the beginning, in the end realized how much they loved their women. The setting for Ben and Martins womanizing ways was always around the dinner table. This film is a laugh out loud romantic comedy that is sure to have audiences falling out of their seats. The film shows that love is capable of crossing all boundaries. If a successful business woman and a drug addict can make love work then surely anything is possible."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","1","2","3 April 2009"," Knocked Up
","When ""Knocked Up"" came out in summer 2007 it became, shockingly, one of the most critically acclaimed movies of the decade. It was also a box office hit and when I saw it for the first time theatrically I thought it was very good, but was a little surprised at the overwhelming praise it received from critics and audiences. I gave the film another shot today after finally getting around to seeing Apatow's directorial debut ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" last night and found my feelings to be almost exactly the same as the first time I watched it. I've noticed a backlash build up against the film recently, and while I wish to distance myself from that as I still enjoyed the film quite a bit, I do have to admit that, well, it's a little, here comes the dreaded word: overrated.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" is far more focused on drama than ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is, in fact the relationship drama seems to me the real center of the film instead of the comedy. I have no problems with this at all, but now that I've seen it twice I know that my personal feelings on the dramatic aspects of this screenplay are that it's not anything really special. It's a good, solid story with well-written characters, but I really don't think it's worthy of the sort of praise heaped on it. Do Heigl's Alison or Rogen's Ben really hold a candle to Andy as characters, or really any of the supporting characters in this live up to those from ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""? I don't think so.<br/><br/>The movie is less focused on sex than ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and Apatow proves himself capable of handling comic conversations with emotional relevance to the story yet again. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" was great thanks to superb comedic timing from the entire cast and Apatow as a director, as well as whoever edited the film. It was a phenomenal example of its craft. ""Knocked Up"" is a very good example of its craft. I don't care for Heigl though she's okay here and in all honesty I think I prefer Rogen as a supporting actor and writer than in a leading role. He was great on ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared"" and in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", but I think there was a little too much of his shtick here and in ""Pineapple Express"". ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is problematic for several reasons but it has a lot of plus points, Rogen's toned-down and efficient performance (mostly, I gather, due to Kevin Smith limiting his improv) and Elizabeth Banks' brilliant turn as Miri perhaps the strongest aspects of the film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Knocked Up"", I really did, and I hope I haven't sounded too negative about the film because I still thought it was very good. I much preferred ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" from Apatow as a writer as far as his movie career goes and the better Apatow-produced film from 2007 in my estimation was ""Superbad"". I actually think Rogen is a better writer than actor, and while Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd made up somewhat for Heigl and Rogen's occasional mediocrity and lack of great comic timing, it didn't keep it from affecting my enjoyment of the film. Glad I gave this a rewatch but I think the one I'll keep going back to is Apatow's debut."
"royals794","9","1","2","23 October 2008"," The Apatow Team does it again
","The 40 Year Old Virgin was one of my favorite comedies of all time, so naturally I had high hopes for Seth Rogen's debut as a leading actor. I walked out of the theater highly satisfied the first time I saw Knocked Up and went a second time in theaters, only to find that I enjoyed it even more. Much like The 40 Year Old Virgin, I found the movie very funny the first time I saw it, but it has only gotten funnier each time I have seen it. The first time I saw The 40 Year Old Virgin, I thought it hilarious, but not the funniest movie I'd ever seen. About 20 viewings later, I now think it might be. A similar thing happened to Knocked Up. When it made its run on HBO, I started watching pieces of it every time it came on and have probably seen the majority of it about eight or nine times by now. It now holds a special place in my heart next to The 40 Year Old Virgin as a rare comedy that manages to combine outrageously hilarious situations with real life characters.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a stoner slacker whose idea of a good time is smoking out of his bong and playing ping pong with his roommates. He is unemployed; his only money source is from a lawsuit over a guy who ran over his foot years ago, and his only ""job"" is preparing a website which tells you when your favorite actresses appear nude in movies. He is happy just drifting about in life until a one night stand with a beautiful stranger named Alison (Katherine Heigl) throws a wrench into his life. Alison is a rising employee for E!, but her life is thrown off track when her drunken night with Ben results in a pregnancy. The ensuing romance between the two consists of the bulk of the movie. The romance between the two is both believable and hilarious; the movie never gets mushy, as many romantic comedies do, and manages to find the same balance as in The 40 Year Old Virgin between vulgarity and hilarity.<br/><br/>I would rank Knocked Up just slightly below The 40 Year Old Virgin on the Apatow scale of greatness. Both movies have the rare quality of standing up after multiple viewings; in fact, both films only seem to get funnier the more times you watch them. This is due to a great script and great comedic timing by the actors, which enables you to quote the movie endlessly to your friends long after its over. Rarely has a day gone by in the last few years in which I have not quoted either Knocked Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin, or Superbad. Unlike most R rated comedies of recent years, Knocked Up isn't only appealing to teenage boys. This movie is funny to everybody, regardless of age or gender. While the humor is somewhat vulgar at times, it is there for a purpose besides simply being a series of sight gags. You really grow to care about the characters of Ben and Alison and their developing relationship. You'll also laugh along with them a whole lot."

","For a long time now, I've heard a lot of hoopla about Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen being the new kings of comedy. But frustratingly, I hadn't seen any of their movies. Until now. I can say that Rogen and Apatow are very funny men and that they've crafted a hilarious, outrageous yet surprisingly sweet tale but I can also say, in my honest opinion that they aren't the new kings of comedy. Once I see more of their movies I can judge better but for now I can say that they know how to make very funny movies and that they well on their way to bump off the likes of Stiller, Wilson (Owen), and Ferrell from the top of the laugh pyramid.<br/><br/>This has to be one of the more amusing films I've seen in a long time. Lately the comedy level has been raised by future classics (Tropic Thunder, Juno) and then lowered dramatically (American Pie Beta House, and all that spoof nonsense), but luckily Knocked Up is in the first category. Believe the hype, Seth Rogen is bloody hilarious, Judd Apatow is a great director, Katherine Heigel is a good comedic actress and this deserves to be in the Top 07 Movie to Watch list of everyone."
"brando647","8","1","2","7 September 2008"," A Profane, Entertaining ""Romantic"" Comedy from Apatow & Crew
","Judd Apatow's second feature film doesn't have nearly as much raunchy humor as his first, but injects it with more heartfelt moments to balance it all out. In the film, slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) gets career-minded Alison Scott pregnant after a drunken one-night-stand and the two come together in an attempt to create a relationship out of their situation. I didn't find the film as ""laugh-out-loud"" funny as Apatow's first movie, but this was still a great movie in it's own regard. There were points were I felt the length of the movie (the unrated version runs 2 hrs. 13 min.) but I never got bored and I never stopped laughing.<br/><br/>One thing you'll find when watching an Apatow film is that he uses a lot of same cast for each film, and I'm glad he does because he's managed to network with some of the funniest performers in modern film. I continue to believe that Seth Rogen is one of the funniest men in entertainment and this movie only strengthens that belief. He's hilarious at all the right times here and gives a sincere performance that helps you like the character, even when he does something stupid (and he does, multiple times). Katherine Heigl is enjoyable and seems like she had a great time in her role, but I couldn't help but lose a bit of respect for her after she complained about the movie following it's release. For me, the best parts of the film involved Ben's friends (Jonah, Jay, Jason, and Martin) or Paul Rudd (who's got great chemistry with Rogen). Whenever these guys were on screen, it cracked me up.<br/><br/>As I'd mentioned, this film doesn't come with as much raunchy humor as Apatow's other film, though it still has some. People should not jump into this film expecting the usual romantic comedy because they will be disappointed (and probably shocked). At it's core, the film has a warm-hearted story about a slacker rising to the challenge to become a father-figure for his arriving child. Filling it out are plenty of sexual humor, drug use, and the usual profanity. So, if you think about it, it'd be pretty easy for this film to appeal to both men and women."
"super_dale","7","1","2","30 July 2008"," more laughs than your average romcom
","The romantic comedy is big business in Hollywood. Like the action movie staple, it is designed to appeal to a wide audience. But we've all seen so many of these films that they have totally lost any ability to surprise us. Boy meets girl, boy and girl like each other, an obstacle is placed in their way, boy loses girl, the obstacle is overcome... the audience won't stand an unhappy ending, so the destination is always the same; everyone lives happily ever after. What matters, then, is what happens along the way.<br/><br/>No one will be surprised to learn that Knocked Up does not deviate from this formula- but starting from an unusual premise (a one night stand between Ben and Alison, two mismatched types) and developing a new genre, the gross-out romantic comedy (I know! Romance for the girls and sick gags for the boys, it's a sure-fire winner) it remains consistently entertaining along the way.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film is that I had no sympathy at all with Ben and his slacker friends. A few genuinely funny gags aside, they remained impressively irritating throughout the movie. Much better is director Judd Apatow's sly dig at the conventions of the form, an interesting subplot centred around the marital troubles of Alison's sister and her husband, a few years down the marriage road. Convincingly played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann, the couple's problems are not fully resolved; look, Apatow is saying to us, Ben and Alison may be happy at the end of the movie, but in a few years' time this is where they may well end up.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays Ben well, a big bear of a man scared to grow up. I was less convinced by Alison, played by Katherine Heigl; maybe it's the way the role is written, but she never creates a realistic personality for the character. One minute she is revolted by the lifestyle of Ben and his friends, and seemingly within no time she is enthusiastically joining in. Still, there are enough laughs for a strong supporting cast to keep the entertainment rolling along to the inevitable conclusion. Like many romantic comedies, I am not sure Knocked Up will live long in the memory. It's too long for a comedy (really, two hours? Ninety minutes is always enough). However, it offers more genuine laughs than most in the genre, and confirms Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen as talents to watch."

Also although the characters are well sketched out, the relationship between the two protagonists is highly unlikely leading to some moments that just don't work.

","For Ben (Seth Rogen) and Alison (Katherine Heigl) a drunken roll in the hay leads to an unexpected pregnancy. Alison decides to keep the baby but can the prospective parents forge an 'opposites attract' romance?<br/><br/>I can't put my finger on it but there's something about this film that doesn't quite measure up to Apatow's previous effort, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". The film reunites a few cast members from that film and picks up a few new faces along the way. Seth Rogen is consistently funny and has good chemistry with Katherine Heigl but I wouldn't say that he's as talented as Steve Carrell. Ben's circle of loser friends is an entertaining bunch as well. Actually, the only performance that isn't up to snuff is Harold Ramis (as Ben's dad), who illustrates why he should stick to writing/directing.<br/><br/>The drop in quality may be due to a script that isn't as funny as ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". The film tries to strike an emotional chord as well but is only successful some of the time as it treads the fine line between maudlin and sincere. The story also feels a little padded with the marital trials and tribulations of Alison's sister, which add little to the story.<br/><br/>The directing & music are unobtrusive and otherwise not worth remarking upon.<br/><br/>It was apparently the unrated version that I saw but really there was nothing in it to differentiate it from the usual R-rated fare.

"jimjo1216","Null","1","2","27 February 2008"," An Entertaining and Touching Comedy (So Don't Expect a Rip-Roarious Laugh Fest)
","Not the joke parade that ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" was, but this film's got a lot of heart. I'd say the main focus is on the serious subject matter: a young couple struggling to make the best out of an unexpected pregnancy.<br/><br/>It seems like a more real-life, touching kind of story than in ""Virgin"" (where the focus was the ridiculous situation of a man who'd never had sex). This movie is something that could happen to anyone. There's still some comedy (mostly in the form of improvised comebacks). The film also gives an entertaining look at the differences in male and female perspectives.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Virgin"" and read rave reviews of this movie, but I found many one-star reviews online and wasn't sure what to expect. Personally, I really liked the film. Not so much as an uproarious comedy as a heartfelt look at real-world issues, seen through a not-too-serious lens. (There are cast and crew baby photos during the end credits.) It's not too off-the-wall and it's not too melodramatic. It's just serious enough, and there's some humor to go with it.<br/><br/>I think most of the criticisms I read were about vulgarity. This film is rated R (or above), so vulgarity shouldn't catch you off-guard. There is a lot of swearing, but not to the extent that people were complaining about. I didn't notice it as a problem. (Maybe I'm desensitized.) It's used in conversations the way I'd hear out with friends. Not for the overly sensitive and not for small children. There is also some nudity (including a few shots of authentic childbirth action), so keep that in mind if that's an issue.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays Ben, who becomes the father of Alison's (Katherine Heigl) unborn child. Alison lives with her sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd), whose marriage is work. The two sisters stick by each other's side while the two men bond. The supporting cast includes many Apatow Productions alums (including Jason Segel and Martin Starr from ""Freaks and Geeks"" and Jonah Hill, who'd later star in ""Superbad""). Paul Rudd has some of the best lines.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" has its raunchy moments, but it's not a mindless, raunchy, fratboy comedy. Don't expect comedic genius or two hours of gags, because this movie is more about heart. This is a very entertaining film if you go into it with the right mindset. I'd bet it would be a good pick to watch with your girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, or husband. 7.5/10 stars.<br/><br/>(NOTE: I've only seen the R-rated theatrical version, so I don't know what's different on the unrated DVD.)"

","I would say that this is a very funny movie, but nothing super special. People are really starting to love Judd Apatow and I think he makes some quality movies that are very enjoyable. I think the scenes with Seth's friends were the best. They acted in a very real way and much how a bunch of random guys would act. I unfortunately did not feel for the characters as much as I could have. Heigel's character was a little flat and nothing special. Seth's character was not fully explored and I thought he had a lot of potential, but he changed out of nowhere. You can see it coming, but there was no real evident change in character except he did basic things that were not surprising. I really loved the scene with the dad. That was heart felt and that showed character growth through a very basic conversation. That relationship felt real, but I was kind of curious why the dad followed his deadbeat son to California from Canada or if it was the other way around. It was a very funny movie and I would enjoy watching it again, but it was not a great movie."

","The characters are like able enough and .............. errr...... That's it! The characters are like able enough but it just isn't funny. Don't just take my word for it - I watched it with my girlfriend on DVD and after 40 minutes without so much as a single snicker between us we both decided that we would couldn't be bothered to finish it. Which puts it into a category with only three or four other movies that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Breakdown: The slobbish guys: Not funny. They are not nearly bad enough. Compared to any other High School/Varsity comedy movie they are just not gross enough. If you had a daughter you'd be thinking that they're nice boys who just need a woman to lay down the law a bit to make them into respectable adults.<br/><br/>The baby thing: I presume this is for the girls since I've never yet met a guy (even one with kids) who thinks gynecology is funny and I think most girls would see it as a no-brainer to just get it terminated at 8 weeks. Unfortunately my girlfriend ddin't find it funny either.<br/><br/>I've given it 2 stars only because it isn't actually bad as such so I can imagine that some women (who I don't know) might like it a bit."
"native_girl333","7","1","2","18 January 2008"," Always use projection to avoid the serious consequences
","The film title suggested that ""Knocked Up"" would be full of rude and vulgar language and humor but the movie was more meaningful than I had thought.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Katherine Heigl because of her wonderful performance as Isobel ""Izzie"" Stevens in the drama series ""Grey's Anatomy"". That was a reason big enough to watch ""Knocked Up"". If a star which is on the top of her career and she has decided to make this comedy is worth of watching, I thought.<br/><br/>In ""Knocked Up"" Alison (Heigl) and Ben (Seth Rogen) end up having sex after meeting at a local bar. The thing would not be anything peculiar but because of their backgrounds and current situation they stood on a very different grounds. Alison is making it big working for E! Entertainment as a host of the show. Instead of having a job Ben spends his days smoking pod and hang out with his as equal roommates. After having sex Alison discovers that she is pregnant with Ben's child. That is a tough thing to bite...<br/><br/>The director/writer Judd Apatow (""40 Year-Old and Virgin"") has chosen the subjects what might be very hilarious and funny but Apatow has a message buried deep in. Sometimes when we end up doing things that may have a catastrophic features those might be the just what we are looking for we just don't know it at first. That philosophy applies with the theme of ""Knocked Up"". The movie had it's moments and it was quite touching and conversational. It might not have been a top-notch comedy but it was sure entertaining. At intervals the movie did got stuck with the rhythm and it felt a bit long. Still I liked the general thought of the movie."
"johneberhardt","8","1","2","24 November 2007"," More of a drama with many stereotypes
","I went (was dragged) to this without seeing or hearing anything about it. It's been a long time since I've seen it but I still vividly remember the haunting scene of Pete walking out the door with the cake in his hands at his kid's birthday party (this was a killer scene for me). For the most part, I agree with the comments of some other reviewers- not funny enough to be called a comedy, stereotype (cliché) of pothead-losers with no direction and using too much vulgarity for no particular reason. I can accept an unusual amount when using it for dramatic effect or to highlight an issue (see the Randall character in Clerks I and II for an example of ignorance versus stupidity and the combination of both). I think, however, that if any actor wanted to portray a believable, real world slob (even an idiot usually possesses some sort of internal feedback loop) could have done better. The only difference here (for me anyway) is that I actually identified with the Pete character a little more than I was comfortable with. More reality than I was prepared for or ever really wanted to think about. Having kids doomed my first marriage and (for me) even the thought that the act of having children could create a relationship between two totally different people or stabilize a strained relationship is absurd-pure fantasy (I'll admit there is a slim possibility but this is mostly nonsense). Pete's relationship, as portrayed by Paul Rudd, was the bright spot in this dimly lit comedy. Pete's marriage was all too typical and all too real, while rest of the film was and is pure fantasy- more in common with a science fiction film or a vampire movie than actual real life."
"fwomp","8","1","2","15 November 2007"," Unrealistic But Damn Funny
","KNOCKED UP has some of the funniest dialog and delivery you've probably ever seen in the past year. Although the plot is a bit contrived and unrealistic (the stoner dude with no ties would probably tuck tail and run when he found out about the pregnancy!), the acting is quite good with a cast that reflects the moral ambiguity of our times.<br/><br/>This is the story of a one-night-stand that never should have happened. The girl, Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is sexy, funny, and successful. The boy, Ben Stone (Seth Rogen, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN) is a pot-smoking and frumpy loser with nearly pornographic ambitions.<br/><br/>The two unawares meet up at a hoppin' club and bump into one another at the bar. Alison has already had too much to drink and Ben is also well on his way. The two dance, chat, and eventually end up in bed, much to the chagrin of Alison come coyote morning. The two happily separate from one another and both think that is that. But a few weeks later, Alison's morning sickness kicks in. She and her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann, BOTTLE ROCKET) rush to the drug store and buy up every brand of pregnancy test they can find and, yep, that little red line shows up every time.<br/><br/>Alison and Ben are thrust back together in the name of impending parenthood. Alison quickly decides that abortion is out of the question; she wants a kid and is already getting ""older."" Forced to either accept the pregnancy or leave Alison and her unborn child to circumstances, Ben tries to form a bond with Alison, only to have multiple obstacles thrown in his path. First is his lifestyle. He lives with a bunch of stoners who's only wish is to create a website that focuses on female nudity. Ben's father (Harold Ramis, THE ICE HARVEST, director) can't give much fatherly advice since he's a washed-up stoner, too. And Alison's sister Debbie doesn't really want him around.<br/><br/>Alison and Ben's on-again off-again relationship seems doomed. The two have nothing in common except the pregnancy and the audience is left (for a while) to wonder if Alison wouldn't be better off raising her child away from Ben anyway.<br/><br/>Eventually the fateful delivery day looms and Ben has set himself onto the path of fatherhood, moving himself away from his pot-smokin' days and buddies. Although Alison has shunned him, the two are forced back together again once Alison's labor begins and she has no way to get to the hospital. Rushing her through traffic, Ben gets her to the delivery suite and Alison and he are eventually united via the bonds of babydom.<br/><br/>The funniest parts of the film are surprisingly not between Heigl and Rogen, but instead between Rogen and Paul Rudd (NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM), who plays Pete, Debbie's husband and Alison's brother-in-law, as they head to Vegas on a roadtrip after Debbie boots him out of the house and he finds solace with Ben. Their 'shroom experience is absolutely fantastic and will probably have you wetting yourself (""There are five different kinds of chairs in this room."") This is, without a doubt, director Judd Apatow's best film to date; it's even above THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN and ANCHORMAN. But it is unrealistic. People as varied as Ben and Alison DO NOT get together. And even if they initially did, they certainly wouldn't stay so. That said, I will say that it was refreshing to not see two hunky actors in the prime roles. Although Katherine Heigl is a damn fine looking lady, there are other actresses that certainly look better. And Seth Rogen appears as a sloth, which was an interesting dichotomy within the sexual portions of the film."

","I just finished viewing this from a rental..<br/><br/>I found it entertaining, but a lot of things seem to be left out of the film as far as character background etc..such as<br/><br/>1.Why did Ben come here from Canada?. 2.How did 14,000 he got in a settlement last living in California? It should have been about a month, and that is if he had the full amount, and was that $14k in Canadian or US dollars? Which would be less here. 3.And if none of these guys had a job how did they pay rent, and other bills? 4.When he got responsible how did he land a job here in the US if he was here illegally? Did he have fake papers, social security number? None of that was explained.<br/><br/>5.Did Alison ever have a boyfriend recently that went bad? Bad Experiences with guys before overall? Just to busy with a career to date? and really would she have just went with a guy she had zero in common with just for the baby?<br/><br/>A lot seemed to be left out of the film as far as the characters and why they were what they were, I know this was a comedy, but it had to be somewhat believable, even if you go past how two people such exact opposites would get together or even sleep together, even way drunk, also if he remembered nothing, as he stated before in the film, how did he remember later not getting the condom on, and what she said? How did he know it just didn't break? OK enough with the huhs.<br/><br/>It had it's funny moments, but even for a comedy it just seemed to go along without any substance or explanation as if the movie said, here is what you have, believe it, don't look for reason, just go with it..I for one like a little bit of plot development then just people thrown into a situation and here it is, a little character background would have went a long way in explaining how they would have wound up loving each other at the end."
"writers_reign","8","2","7","25 August 2007"," Foetal Attraction
","I'm not sure if the best joke in this movie was intentional but irrespective of whether Judd Apatov is familiar with the musical Follies or not it was classy to see the leading man playing a character called Ben Stone, a name shared by one of the four leads in Follies, whose own title is, of course, multi-layered. Knocked Up has just opened in England to mostly rave reviews and though it's not the kind of movie I would gravitate toward naturally I decided to see what all the fuss was about and on the whole I'm glad I did. On one level there is a high content of juvenalia in the attitude of the group of four male friends one of whom, Seth Rogen, lucks in, against what must be astronomical odds, to a seriously beautiful and intelligent girl, Kathy Heigl who unnacountably takes him home for unprotected sex after a casual meeting in a bar/disco. It's how the film handles the aftermath - Heigl becomes pregnant - that is its strength; for one thing Rogen matures to the stage where he shows serious signs of maturing and accepting the role of father and despite the evidence of a less than stable marriage between Heigl's sister and her husband, the two seem prepared to give relationships a shot. In short what we have here is the classic mixture of laughter and tears but, like several similar films it's something to be enjoyed once but not necessarily revisited."

","Upon watching this movie recently,I was(among many thoughts)reminded of another ""Pregnancy changes everything"" comedy: Nine Months from 1995. That film,directed by Chris Columbus and starring Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore,also featured an unplanned pregnancy that was forcing an otherwise relaxed,responsibility-free(relatively)bachelor to commit to the child he's helped create AND the relationship he was in. The differences,however,are loud and clear: where ""Months"" was played for slap-sticky,almost cruel laughs and shameless manipulation(and hence the reason I've practically sworn off ANYTHING Mr.Columbus writes or directs),""Knocked"" is actually done with a sense of wit,savvy,solid character study and very deliberate,studied injections of sentiment.<br/><br/>Schlubby,beefy slacker Ben Stone(Seth Rogen,who looks about five to ten years OLDER than his actual age)lives with his buddies with the intent that breaks down to two(make it three)elements:movies(and the knowledge of all things related),music and getting stoned. The collective ambition of he and his buddies(JOnah Hill,Jason Segel,Martin Starr and Jay Baruchel)is to start a website that is able to document any and all actresses who are naked in movies down to the minutes and frames. <br/><br/>Meanwhile,pretty,well-adjusted and responsible Allison Scott(Katherine Heigl,a hybrid of the girl-next-door and a human Barbie doll)is seeing her career rise as she's promoted from behind-the-camera staff for E! Television to on-air personality. She and some girlfriends go to celebrate the promotion at a local nightclub.<br/><br/>At said nightclub,the two opposites meet,charm and attract. Of course,it doesn't take anyone of great genius or intuitive skill to figure,from the title of the film,that their dalliance--a sweaty,sloppy fête accompli at her(?) place--will yield something more than merely sex tales of conquest for him and a possible ""I did that?"" recollection from her.<br/><br/>As both Ben and Allison agree to work through the pregnancy together(A decision that takes remarkably little angst from both parties),their winding,twisting road toward love is,of course,not lacking bumps and potholes,many of them inadvertently supplied by each others' supports: his buddies and her sister and best friend Debbie(Leslie Mann,getting a seemingly rare chance to expand on a role) and her husband Pete(Paul Rudd,more comfortable than ever as a down-to-earth ""Guy's guy"" in film). Of course,the obstacles that Ben and Allison themselves have to overcome prove to be the most important to the story.<br/><br/>Director/writer Judd Apatow doesn't miss a beat from 2005's 40 Year Old Virgin, making what could be arch-type characters and comedic situations actually have sympathy to cut the sharp edges of pathos and profanity. He is also able to make even some of the more secondary or tertiary characters(i.e. the slough of OBGYNs that work on Allison,Pete and Debbie's daughters, Allison's co-workers,her mom,Ben's dad,the girlfriend of one of Ben's friends)funny and interesting,which seems to be asking a lot of a lot of directors and/or screenwriters. Last but not least,the warm,scuzzy charm of Rogen and the soft,oh-so-human Heigl give very fitting and grounded performances. It may not be quite as daft a movie as ""Virgin',but it's made with such intelligence that it EASILY runs circles around just about any movie(genre alike or no)this summer. Pregnancy movies can be played for easy laughs or hard. The more difficult laughs are more rewards,thus so is this film."

It's a rare movie experience, because on one level it's clever and funny, but what really carries this movie are the beautifully written characters. Each is believable, likable and enjoyable to watch as they grow, form relationships and struggle with their imperfections.<br/><br/>The premise is pretty obvious, and the aptly fitting title will flag immediately, this isn't your parent's comedy. That said, it will appeal to a very broad audience of open minded movie goers. While it is in part a stoner movie and a buddy movie, at the core of it is a heartfelt story that will touch everyone's hearts.<br/><br/>Apatow is a consistent man: he writes about what he knows, he reuses his favorite actors, and he carefully crafts brilliant comedies. There are so many scenes I'd love to mention to sell you on this movie if you're on the fence about seeing it. So many times I'm watching, laughing, saying to myself ""God, I know what that feels like"". Then there are other times where beside me my girlfriend is laughing, thinking ""I've been there before"". Without giving anything away, all I can really hope is that you will take my word for it and thank me later when you love this movie as much as I did.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" is an excellent movie if you're looking for a laugh, but it gives you so much more.

","I think Knocked Up was funny. I do think it was too long and could've spent more time in an editing bay. There were a lot of scenes that were in the final cut that did not progress the character development or the story. Also, the set-up is far-fetched. I'm from LA, there's no way in hell a girl that hot at a club would even talk to, let alone dance with a guy that fugly, unless he was dripping in diamonds. LA is a material place, that set-up should've been stronger. The story spent way too much time with the secondary characters, it's Ben's story. People are freaking over this movie in my opinion because of the dearth of good movies out there. It's not classic, nor will be a classic like Dumb and Dumber or Something About Mary. And I wonder if it got the Guiness World Record for the most F words in a movie...<br/><br/>Once again, fun but not great.<br/><br/>Watch The Hospital by Paddy Chafevsky or Being There by Hal Ashby...Those are great comedies."

Its just not. That's not to say its awful because its not, its just not what I would label a hysterically funny movie. Its funny but hardly consistently so. There are many lapses in the comedy. Its too long - if it were edited better, the movie would have benefited.<br/><br/>I could also complain about the believability of the characters. I did not believe for a moment that Alison really liked Ben all that much, even after she said she did. Maybe that was the script, maybe that was Heigl, but I didn't buy it.<br/><br/>A lot of the enjoyment I got from the movie came from Leslie Mann, who played Alison's sister Debbie. I liked her a lot in ""Orange County"" even though she didn't have that big a role in that movie. She's very easy going, very likable. I like Paul Rudd, too, and he's very good.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed Kristen Wiig as Alison's co-worker Jill. She has only two scenes but she makes the most of them.<br/><br/>The actors that have cameos are also fun, notably Ryan Seacrest and James Franco.<br/><br/>I have to confess that I find it a very beautiful thing to see a woman give birth, and that scene was very well done and very touching for me.<br/><br/>Again, it was a good time, but I can't go quite overboard as some of the other users and critics seem to be able to do. 7/10."
"jaredmobarak","7","2","7","1 June 2007"," I need to change chairsKnocked Up
","Can Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow strike gold twice in as many tries? Well I guess you can say they had success together with TV shows ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared,"" but then, despite what seemed to be universal love, both got cancelled. It wasn't until The 40 Year Old Virgin hit that they started becoming household names. With Apatow's follow-up, Knocked Up, he has brought his old friend out from the shadows and into the spotlight. Rogen definitely has the talent to hit it out of the park, but as far as the film itself striking gold as its predecessor did for me, I have to say it comes up a bit short. Let's just say it strikes silver.<br/><br/>Our story is one that occurs probably too often in the real world, a one-night stand which produces offspring. We are of course privy to the obligatory abortion sequence, although short and never mentioned in lieu of ""smushmortion,"" but the real impetus to the movie is these two finding each other and common ground to raise a child. Right from the get go, both leads want the baby and work hard in order to achieve their goal, slowly finding out that they may have real feelings for the other. After recently checking out the fantastic hijinks from the previous Steve Carell film, I expected to be laughing non-stop here. The plot is laced with seriousness, but ripe for satire and hilarity. What ends up happening, however, is that the jokes are merely window dressing for the tale of love conquering all. All the serious issues at play are very much in the forefront and Knocked Up ends up being an entertaining date movie first, uproarious comedy second. This is by no means a bad thing, it just wasn't exactly what I was anticipating going in. In the end it works to balance the two directions, although somewhat precariously because when the laughs arrive they are huge, only making the serious parts that much more sobering and ultimately a tad boring.<br/><br/>Apatow again succeeds with flying colors as far as scripting a story with heart and realism. He pulls no punches at all and never goes into the realm of schtick or surrealism. You have to applaud the man for going so far as to showing the baby crowning during birth as well as actually giving the mother a slimy child rather than a cleaned off ""prop"" instead. We are witnessing the relationship between two strangers as they are thrust into each other's lives. It is absolutely paramount that we see the reality of the situation and understand where each is coming from throughout all their activities and actions. Maybe the lack of Carell co-writing led to the somewhat more subdued end result, but even so, this film is very funny.<br/><br/>Let's just say that I would pay to watch two hours of Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd in a room riffing with one another alone. Every time these two share screen time is the best moment of the film. Their film quote referencing, Back to the Future and Swingers being some of the best, are classic and the rapport they share is genuine, most is surely ad-libbed. As for the casting of Rogen's friends, what better way to do so than with his real friends? The foursome all play characters sharing their own first names and the comradery and insults are so spot- on it once again must be mostly improvised. Every sly jab at the one for being in a bet not allowing him to shave is priceless. For him to be the one they are grateful is not a Jew to eventually being thought of as one because of the facial hair is a great evolutionMatisyahu anyone?<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, Katherine Heigl truly shines as the woman at the center of it all. Her life is flipped upside down and her emotions run high. I have not seen her in anything elseno I have not watched ""Grey's Anatomy"" as of yetbut I have to say I was impressed by her performance. While talking of acting range I will also mention the phenomenal job Rogen did himself. Always being the funny guy coming into scenes, he really needed to step up here and carry the film. His character undergoes a huge transformation during the course of the movie and Rogen makes every moment of it believable. Other credit goes to the entire Apatow family. His wife Leslie Mann is finally given a role she can run with besides the usual ten-minute butt of the joke scenes I'm used to seeing her partake in. Also, their children, playing her children in the film, are immensely funny. Their interactions together in the car and the eldest's story of where babies come from are quite memorable. Oh and one needs to congratulate Ryan Seacrest with a wonderful bit of self-parody and the other friends popping up like Carell and James Franco.<br/><br/>So, in the end, Apatow delivers a heartfelt tale of love mixed with a good amount of humor, both sweet and broad. While definitely an R-rated feature with many moments of hilarity due to graphic language and or actions, I would still say this is more for the date crowd than the group of friends going out for a Friday night. The laughs are there, and big in most instances, however, the end result is really a romantic comedy when you look closely. It may be the crudest rom-com you'll see, but it also is one of the more effective ones."
"pjreiter","3","2","8","17 September 2007"," Broke the world record for curse words
","There were so many things wrong with this film that I am completely bewildered by the majority of positive reviews for this vile flick. First of all, the huge amount of cursing in this film was completely unnecessary and at no point did I even laugh at this cheap attempt to win me over. Let's just the ""f bomb"" was way overused. Second, the movie is at least 30 minutes too long. There were tons of scenes that should've been cut out of this film. Third, the whole premise of the film was completely ridiculous. It is completely implausible that a smart and good looking woman would even consider giving it a ""good go"" with such a complete and utter loser. Hey, I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a couple hours, but even I have my limits. The racial and offensive jokes throughout the film are so bad that it borders on criminal.<br/><br/>Despite all the above shortcomings, what really bothered me most about this film was the lack of moral character throughout the entire film. Could you imagine being a child raised by these two people that have absolutely no moral character? The movie might have save a little face if she had decided to put it up for adoption. As it is, the kid will probably be smoking dope by age five."

","Previews can be amazing if done right, when they don't misrepresent the product or try to tell you the story in less than 4 minutes. ""Knocked Up"" revealed just enough not to spoil the surprisingly effective comedy that is bound to earn people's respect and make a few fans of its strong and engaging lead actors. Both of these players give outstanding performances as the very different people who must now deal with more mature issues than they are accustomed to.<br/><br/>Hegel is lovely as the professional woman who wants security and love in her life and now has to deal with a less than responsible and immature boyfriend. She recalls the sweetness and insecurity that made people like Lombard and Monroe so successful at playing this type of characters: human and vulnerable. Seth Rogan has an even more difficult task because he is the likable yet irresponsible man that somehow must be likable, still remaining true to his rather irresponsible nature. Will he ever grow up and learn to deal with his responsibilities? Is that possible? The film provides you with some interesting answers.<br/><br/>The film somehow manages to balance emotions ranging from absolutely vulgarity to some refreshing sweetness, the latter sorely missing from Apatow's previous efforts. In the end, the true surprises are the solid direction and terrific, consistent script that keeps us interested and caring for a good couple of hours. The writing is meaty, insightful, even precious for it knows the materials, the weakness and strengths in all of us, and it puts them all together in a very satisfying piece of film-making.<br/><br/>A new classic has been born... and a few stars along the way."

","We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that. Wow. Fantastic funny movie in the vain of Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller etc. The entire cast is excellent Seth Roden, Paul Rudd and every one of the boys and girls in the cast. An absolute scream of a movie.<br/><br/>Best of the year for sure."

"cultfilmfan","10","2","8","2 June 2007"," Knocked Up
","Knocked Up is about a young man named Ben Stone who doesn't work and just sits around and hangs out with his friends hoping they can get a celebrity nudity site off the ground. One night at a bar Ben meets Alison Scott and one thing leads to another and after not seeing each other for awhile she finds out that she is pregnant with his child. Alison gets back in touch with Ben and the two of them try to work things out and accept that they have a few things to change and accept while making way for a baby in their lives. The film is a comedy, but with some heartfelt and dramatic moments as well. Knocked Up is by the co-writer and director of The 40 Year Old Virgin which is one of my favourite comedies of the last few years and one of my favourite films of 2005. Once again writer/director Judd Apatow blends together crude comedy, drama and a lot of life situations that are actually very well thought out and written. Someone going by the trailer of this film might dismiss it as being a stoner comedy or just another crudely done sexual movie. Well the film does have those moments and when it does it is often very funny and some of the jokes referencing things from pop culture to just plain buddy talk is also well written with sharp dialogue and works because of the great writing and from the great performances by the main stars and it's strong supporting cast as well. The film works also as a film about dealing with the future and issues that like it or not, may happen to a lot of people out there, but instead of condoning what they do the film shows the good times and bad and also how Ben and Alison start to grow on each other and how willing they are to work with each other for their upcoming child. The dramatic scenes are also played out with humour and work well with it's more gentle and softer side that works well also because of good character chemistry and the fact that we are able to believe these characters and what are happening to them and because of the sharp writing, performances and humour that go along with it. In a month where we are bombarded with unnecessary Hollywood sequels and just bad popcorn films, I hope that people will go see Knocked Up because of how well it works on so many levels and because of the talent and skill behind it. It will appeal to those looking for a date movie or a comedy and this film will appeal to both men and women. Knocked Up is certainly one of the most entertaining films of the year so far and also one of the most thought provoking and genuinely sincere and funny films of the year as well. This will be one of my most favourite films of 2007 and after two great films in a row I look forward to seeing what Judd Apatow brings us next because for a modern day comedy when most of what we see is unoriginal and just isn't very good, this is the exception and it is a comedic masterwork."

","Forget about the controversy. Forget about the crap that people post on this movie's page. This is one of the funniest, most uplifting movies that has come out in a while. Little Miss Sunshine set the bar in the past year for comedies and movies in general. Offbeat characters, great scriptwriting and a plot that some may find either too much or not enough. Seth Rogen proves his worthiness as a Hollywood star(even though he did that in Freaks and Geeks). As a strung out, jobless pothead, Rogen plays Ben, a man in his early twenties whose only ambition in life is to have as much fun as possible. When he has a drunk encounter with Katherine Heigel, they end up with facing one of the most traumatizing(at first) experiences any human being can find themselves in: A one night stand that leads to pregnancy.<br/><br/>Despite the controversial title, this movie doesn't set out to gross the audience out with raunchiness or lewdness. Although, a couple of scenes may make some squeamish. What this film does is shed light on the beauty of building a relationship, or rebuilding one(as is the case with Paul Rudd and Leslie Man as Heigl's sister and brother in law). It may sound cliché, but love is definitely not something that just happens. It takes time to build.Whether it's due to unforeseen circumstances or whathaveyou, love and relationships take time and work and the end result can be a very rewarding one.<br/><br/>Knocked Up has one of the best scripts in cinema in probably the past ten years. Funny, touching and witty, it displays real emotion(especially through improved scenes). Every character, from Rogen's lazy buddies, to the higher-ups at Heigl's job at E! Entertainment, is well built and extremely fun to watch. Every scene in this movie deserves attention. This is a must see for anyone with a good sense of humor and wit to match."

The movie in so many ways is great, whether it is the acting or the lessons or the jokes, there was something in this movie that was just pure magic. This movie is really a must-see and it will have you cracking up. The real surprise of the movie though, and the thing that really makes it stand out is the surprise morals that you learn from this movie. It is really a brilliant piece of film history and it real is an era defining comedy. It is a movie that is not only funny but also smart and clever. The jokes aren't all dirty jokes, while many of them are.<br/><br/>I also must say that this is flat-out the best acting that I have ever seen from Katherine Heigl, who is one of my favorite actresses. She really makes the whole movie believable, and just adds to the greatness that is this movie. It is possibly one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and also just one of the best movies I have ever seen. The jokes are very fresh and the movie in no way copies of any movie. The whole movie experience is like something that I have never seen before. That is why Knocked Up is really a must-see movie event."
"kykyryzzzka","4","1","3","17 August 2019"," Even comedies should try to be a little logical
","Do you know this meme of Tony Stark rolling his eyes in Iron Man? Well, that's exactly my face when I watched Knocked Up. I don't remember what kind of time it was in 2007, perhaps standards of comedy were lower, otherwise how else do you explain ratings on metacritics?<br/><br/>Jude Apatow can do better. I watched ""This is 40"" two times, the conversations are funny and smart and story is reasonable. Seth Rogen can do better, I watched ""Pineapple Express"", it's super funny, although maybe because I was a bit high. Katherine Heigl? I don't think there is even one good movie with her.<br/><br/>I'll get to the point - the very idea of a good-looking successful young woman getting pregnant from a bum-like pot-smoking dude who has nothing in common with her and then deciding to keep the baby and moreover build relationship with junkie is a complete nonsense! We will never know why she rejected the most logical idea of an abortion. Is she a republican?<br/><br/>Aside from this we have an egotistic character of Paul Rudd's a bit hysterical wife who believes her husband's life should be fully dedicated to the family. This movie also explores the depth of self-eating that often happens with women also thanks to the movie industry. Alison, once pregnant, feels fat and ugly and calls herself a big whale, Debbie is crying all the time because she feels old and guard at the club confirms that. Both wear make up all the time and have perfect hairstyles 24/7. It makes sense because if you are so self-insecure about your looks, don't you dare sleeping without lipstick otherwise your partner will leave you. 2007 is all about objectifying women.<br/><br/>And this whole story lasts for two hours. You hope it will unfold sometime and you will die laughing, but instead you can't help but check your phone hundred times during the movie. I'm not trying to preach here on how this movie sends a bad message, I'm not trying to be a feminist, I just like honest movies, which are believable and make sense."

The movie DEPENDS on you believing in their coincidental romance and rooting for it against the back drop of the worst married couple ever. I can dark some dark stuff, Family Guy does that impeccably. But they make it into a joke, this is just humour with a lot of darkness inserted.<br/><br/>It's not intelligently made, I don't care to see care free people have their lives disrupted by an inconvenient pregnancy, there aren't jokes so much as banter and the attempt to left itself with sentimentality makes me nauseated.<br/><br/>Pick one; be dark or be sentimental.

","If you've seen any of Seth Rogen's movies, then you should know that he always plays a laid-back goof-off whose life revolves around getting high. Judd Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" is no exception. I thought that the funniest scenes were the ones where Katherine Heigl's go-getter meets Seth Rogen's slacker friends. This story of an unexpected pregnancy makes no pretense about being completely silly.<br/><br/>As to Heigl's claims that the movie was sexist, I can see where she's coming from. According to the movie, men are degenerate morons who want to sit around getting stoned, while women are sexy, ambitious types who snap easily. There's no shortage of movies that depict that, and I wouldn't say that ""Knocked Up"" casts aspersions on anyone.<br/><br/>The main point to take is that Seth Rogen revels in low culture. You can bet money that his next movie will cast him as a stoner who talks about sexual organs and bodily functions all day. As for the widespread dislike of Katherine Heigl, it seems misplaced. She strikes me as an obnoxious individual, but is she really a worse person than, say, the Koch brothers? <br/><br/>I liked ""Knocked Up"", but it won't be for everyone."

Although, You may need to be careful who you bring to see this movie I got to say I have really fallen in love with this new emerging comedy circle that centralizes around Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Jonah Hill and all the others that have appearances in this film.

I really enjoyed ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" and after watching this, I can safely say that it's just as good if not better than his previous film. This is one of those quirky comedies that balances out the romance and drama elements within its two hours. The plot is easy to figure out. Seth Rogen plays Ben, a goofy slacker who is the life of the party. He meets a happy-go-lucky woman named Allison (played by Katherine Heigl). They have a one night stand and weeks later, she finds out that she's pregnant.<br/><br/>There is so much to love about this film. The characters are great, especially Ben's friends who are hilarious. The writing is superb and the jokes hit nearly every time. I know some people are going to be disappointed by it, but I had a fun time watching and enjoyed every minute of it. Judd Apatow should be proud of this accomplishment of a movie, this was a comeback project that worked from start to finish. If you enjoy raunchy comedies with a lot of heart to it, this movie is definitely for you!"

The men act liked doped up adolescents with an interest in building a website that points out when the actors get naked in movies yet in the film Heigl always has sex with her bra on.<br/><br/>However as a comedy the film is less successful, it failed to even make me chuckle slightly, its also overlong when it should had been snappier and I never really bought the relationship between Heigl and Rogen as a couple who would ever get together for a one night stand, never mind be with each other whilst she is expecting."
"Riemmann","3","1","3","4 February 2014"," Did the Mormons subside this movie?
","In this poorly written piece of sexist propaganda, we are asked to believe that a hot 20-sthg woman on a rising career would end up forming a happy family with the immature loser who unfortunately got her pregnant on a drunken night. <br/><br/>The first 10 minutes are mildly amusing. Partying in a club with her married sister in order to celebrate her recent promotion, Alison meets Ben, a somewhat overweight and unattractive guy whose main occupation in life consists in building a soft-porn website. One drunken mistake later, she finds herself pregnant. <br/><br/>After this point, Utah Entertainment Ltd seems to have taken the lead in script writing, and all of the characters' actions become unexplainable and increasingly ridiculous. The decision concerning the baby is rapidly pondered without using once the taboo word ""abortion"", and Alison chooses to keep it (without any satisfactory explanation provided to the viewer), to the joy of Ben who suddenly seems to think that fatherhood would be a pleasant hobby besides smoking pot.<br/><br/>Unconvincingly, the plot goes on with Alison deciding to give the ""relationship"" a try (for the baby? out of loneliness? we are not sure but apparently scenarists have not heard of the concept of raising a baby as a single woman). The evident mismatch is not sufficiently redressed in the following scenes, where we assist in rising disbelief to holding hands and three words declarations from both sides. The end is incoherent but rather standard suspense and happy ending (breaking up, but then Ben quits his slacker lifestyle and they drive happily together to a new house once the baby is born). Isn't family a bliss?<br/><br/>So, aside from a plot requiring frequent willing suspensions of disbelief and a rather retarded vision of society, what are we left with? Two hours of toilet-level humor, failed attempts at romanticism, whiny unsympathetic characters (but especially women), and -ah!- a close-up on a baby coming out which we would rather never have seen.

Of course the whole thing can't be comedy. With so many other characters to help take the focus off the main two, there will be parts of the story that are more ""serious"". True is the case towards the end with Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) having a falling out. This is a very nice, but what seems eternally long, scene about the importance of understanding in a relationship. Could that be the moral of our story Alison and Ben, understanding and acceptance? I think so. Naturally the only thing left is birth and the happily ever after. The hospital scene is definitely NOT for the squeamish. I really hope those parts are not cut from the movie, because they received some of the most reactions. I found this whole seen to be painfully realistic, more so than any other movie has dared to be. Finally, the happy ending is upon us and the closing credits are filled with family snapshots and even childhood photos of cast and crew, very cute. So to you the potential viewer I say that this is an exceptional comedy. It is definitely the funniest thing I have seen this year.

"John_Truby","Null","1","3","7 January 2010"," Great comedy through a painful reality
","For years Hollywood has been looking for the ""high concept"" story. That's a story with a big (and highly marketable) plot twist. Now, because of Judd Apatow, that's starting to change, at least in comedy. Apatow is the father of the ""low concept"" story, and every studio in town is looking for one.<br/><br/>Low concept is a story based on an experience that anyone in the audience could have. Like an accidental pregnancy. The potential audience for a low concept story is huge, because everyone can identify with it. It also has a built-in emotional resonance, and comedy is funnier and more successful when the audience makes an emotional recognition in their own lives.<br/><br/>Sitcoms have known this for years. That's what the form is based on. Until Apatow, nobody thought you could pull the audience out of the house by using that approach in movies. And the conventional wisdom has some merit in this case. Because even though low concept gives you a potentially massive audience that can identify with the story, it puts tremendous pressure on the writer to come up with a new take on an everyday experience the audience knows so well.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly for a low concept story, there isn't much plot in Knocked Up. Love stories are already plot challenged, so when you add low concept to it, you have a story with a big hole in the middle. By the time the boys visit Las Vegas, I felt like we were in another movie.<br/><br/>So how does Apatow overcome the lack of plot and fulfill the requirement that a low concept story put a fresh face on a familiar experience? It's all in the character set up. In the Comedy Class and the Love Story Class, I talk about how these two genres depend heavily on how you set up the character oppositions. In many romantic comedies, the male and female leads are set up as opposites in some way. Then each has a friend who gives them advice, usually wrong, having to do with the stereotypical flaws of the other sex.<br/><br/>Knocked Up starts with the classic opposition of man and woman. In fact, these two are such an odd couple that Apatow has to finesse the fact that Alison, played by Katherine Heigl, would never sleep with Neanderthal Ben, played by Seth Rogen, even if she were blindingly drunk. But this opposition-the mature woman and the man-child-provides the basic line on which the story hangs. It also gives Apatow the essential comic opposition from which he can create a lot of the jokes. True, these jokes play off the commonly perceived differences between men and women. But Apatow is so good at comic dialogue, and his story is so grounded in the emotion of the conflict, that these lines stand out from the usual and are very funny.<br/><br/>But the really brilliant move in the character opposition-indeed what makes the movie-is how Apatow sets up the allies. Ben's ally is not a lone bachelor but a group of adolescent boys in men's bodies. Alison's ally is not a single woman bitter about love and men, but a couple whose marriage is worn to the breaking point.<br/><br/>This character opposition takes the story beyond men and women having trouble dating to the much broader and deeper set of issues about how men and women live the length of their lives. On one extreme is the permanently adolescent man who has complete freedom but no love and no children. On the other extreme is permanent life as a couple, with love and children but no freedom, no sense of self, and the constant realization that one is growing old. By placing pregnancy within this much larger opposition, the emotional and comical resonances ricochet and build to a breaking point within every person in the audience.<br/><br/>The lack of story means the strengths of the character oppositions play out primarily within the individual scenes. But these scenes are often very strong and well worth study. In one remarkable scene, the sister, played by Leslie Mann, and an obviously pregnant Alison try to get into an exclusive club. When the gatekeeper refuses them entry, the sister lays into him, attacking him at his weakest point, which is his pathetic job. It's so real it's painful. He calmly takes her aside and calls her on her true weakness, the reality that has driven her to embarrass herself while trying to embarrass him. She's a stunning beauty but she's getting older, and she and her pregnant sister aren't going through that door.<br/><br/>Great comedy isn't about being funny all the time. Do that and you won't be funny at all. Great comedy is about creating a painful emotional reality, a charged atmosphere where the jokes become lightning bolts, showing you the truth, making you laugh and cutting your heart out all at the same time.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"

","Writer-director Judd Apatow easily tapped into a vastly-commercial comedic market with this film (and 2005's ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") which even the popular TV sitcoms hadn't discovered: a way to bring loutish 'guy' behavior into the embraceable mainstream and mix it in cheerfully with the responsible working class. Unemployed, feckless Canadian living in Los Angeles, into bong blasts and movies with naked chicks, unintentionally gets an attractive television newswoman pregnant and forces himself into rethinking his life. Apatow surrounds central couple Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl with colorful support, from Leslie Mann's Debbie, a tightly-wound sister and suspicious wife to Paul Rudd, to Harold Ramis as Seth Rogen's ""go with the flow"" cool dad. The picture does run long, however it doesn't necessarily overstay its welcome; Apatow rushes through a few meandering excursions, always with something surprising and funny waiting in the wings. He's also careful not to push the film's nicer, more sentimental moments too far--this is definitely a rude, foul-mouthed modern comedy, yet one with a big heart. *** from ****"
"PersianPlaya408","3","1","3","3 August 2008"," A great comedy
","A hilarious film from the makers of 40 year old virgin about a immature party animal who has his one night stand show up on his doorstep informing she is pregnant 8 weeks after they hooked up. Rogen and Heigl play their roles well and have good chemistry. I also liked Paul Rudd in this, i thought like 40 year old virgin, Apatow succeeded again in creating an originally funny movie that also manages to convey a decent message to the audience. I like the use of actors and the great one-liners in this flick, i could definitely watch this over and over again. Not as good as superbad, but pretty darn good IMDb Rating: 7.6. MY Rating: 9/10"
"DarkAngeloX","7","1","3","22 July 2008"," Good, yes! $100 million? HOW?
","I enjoyed this movie. I got past the vulgar language, I found many of the jokes truly funny and there was some chemistry between the two characters. Nearly every day we see couples where we think, ""Why is SHE with him?"" or ""How did he get HER?"" Thus the relationship is somewhat plausible. I guess I'm wondering how this movie reached a ""common denominators"" lowest or otherwise, that allowed it to surpass a box office of $100 million. Obviously there is an audience for this type of ""joe-blow"" humor, F-bombs, drug use and such because similar films have been successful in the past. Comedies and Romantic comedies are judged by box office and word of mouth. I'm wondering how word of mouth spread to widely to affect not only a national but international box office sleeper hit"
"Deveousdevil","8","1","3","24 April 2008"," Surprisingly very good, no regrets watching this.
","For starters, I am a staunch opposer of Judd Apatow movies simply because he does almost the same thing in all of his movies. Nudity, obscene amount of cursing, random disgusting sexual references, the whole works. And in Apatow's very famous film, ""40 year old virgin"", that was simply horrible. However, this movie sort of deviated from his prior usual techniques and actually had a very good storyline, some pretty good acting, (mostly on Heigl's part), some good non-sex related jokes, and a few heartfelt scenes.<br/><br/>The script was very good. There was some interesting dialogue with some good points and overall, actually taught you something about pregnancy from both a male and female perspective. However, Apatow couldn't resist adding his own kind of humor with random incoherent swearing and pointless nudity and/or sexuality. The movie was pretty funny at times and Rogen did a pretty good job in terms of his acting and impovs.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was pretty good. It is not a classic, but it is something worth watching because you can learn something if you take the topic seriously. It is worth a watch."

","I had such high expectations, given Rogen and Apatow's ground-breaking work in ""40-year-old Virgin"".<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" tells the story of a slacker, Ben Stone (Rogen) who gets really lucky one night at a club and finds himself doing the horizontal mambo with blonde bombshell career girl Alison Scott (Heigl). 2 mins later, the course of both their lives is altered irrevocably.<br/><br/>The movie explores how they adapt to each other, and to the people in their respective lives, in light of circumstances that force them together, even though they'd really rather not be.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that Rogen's character, while acute and incisive in a supporting context, can't carry a main role - certainly not in the way Steve Carrell's did in ""40-year-old Virgin"".<br/><br/>It's like the smoke without the fire, or the bang without the cracker. The one is nothing without the other, even though the reverse isn't necessarily true. Rogen, to his credit, does very well in crafting a likable loser here. And so full credit to him for that achievement.<br/><br/>Heigl, for her part, is really delightful in this role, but she too suffers in this movie from Apatow's unfortunate ability to create his most interesting characters in a cameo roles. Cases in point are: Paul Rudd character, his wife played by Leslie Mann, the bouncer at the club where all the trouble originally started, and Heigl's sterile plastic bosses at the TV station.<br/><br/>What you end up with is a patchwork quilt of very funny characters. On the whole, though, it ends up as somewhat less than the sum of its parts."
"Klickberg","3","1","3","16 November 2007"," Frankly, found it boring and tired
","I finally saw KNOCKED UP yesterday, and as with a few of the other reviewers, I don't really see what all of the fuss is about. I'd like to think of myself as a ""fan"" of Judd Apatow; I never saw 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, but I like his work from THE CRITIC and the LARRY SANDERS SHOW (and, hey, who CAN'T like HEAVY WEIGHTS?). <br/><br/>Simply put, I thought this movie would be a dull and hackneyed rehash of the usual frat fare, and it was. Yes, the fellows in it aren't the best looking guys, and they're presumably ""literate"" when it comes to movies and whatnot (though, I do despise the level of pop culture references in this one: felt like more of a commercial at times, both because I could care less about the whole American IDOL/LOST set, and because I didn't think guys like that would necessarily watch that nonsense either). But, in the end, they're still just frat guys/ jocks living inside the bodies of fat slacker losers (who somehow are able to pass through without having jobs). <br/><br/>The most difficult thing for me to reconcile about the film is the fact that the script was so unbelievably rigid in its fascism of the characters. People were just simply MARRIED; but you never had a feeling that they truly cared for each other. People suddenly CHANGE at a key moment, but you never really see even the most subtle development beforehand. And no one ever seems to respond to one another, especially when telling (or trying to tell) a joke. There were a number of times in which someone (namely Rogen) says something that makes you cringe and say, ""No. Not even a fat slacker loser like that would think to say something so vulgar at a time like this. He may be a stoner, but he's not mentally challenged, and he certainly knows a thing or two about being a nice guy. He wouldn't say that. He knows better.""<br/><br/>The other stories at play were hardly developed and really meandered throughout. This fact, plus the mindbogglingly poorly developed wooden characters led me to feel that the best I could say is that, in the end, this film is pretty decent television.<br/><br/>Admitedly, I sat through the entire film, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. Yes, it was very popular, but McDonald's is the best-selling restaurant in the world and they don't necessarily serve the best food..."
"rddj05","6","1","3","14 November 2007"," Good Film....eventually
","Knocked Up winds up being a funny and honest movie...eventually. It has a running time of 2 hours and 15 min. My advice to anyone watching would be to skip the first hour and 15 min. Nothing really happens in this time except the setup to the film (which is not even remotely plausible), and a LOT of penis and fart jokes. A lot. The first few are mildly amusing, the 20th one, not so much. There are no spoilers involved in the following setup. Katerine Heigl plays Allison, an absolute knockout, who is intelligent, funny, and who's career has just taken a big leap forward with her recent promotion at a popular entertainment network (that's the believable part). She suddenly decides to go to a club one night (apparently the only date she can get is her sister) and for some reason, no one hits on her. No one. So, obviously desperate (and a bit drunk), she decides to pick up the biggest loser in the club (Ben Stone), invites him back to her place, and has wild sex with him (apparently because he helped her get a drink at the bar. Guys, if you want a really hot girl to have sex with you, this may be your plan).<br/><br/>Despite being disgusted at the sight of him the next morning, and despite the fact that she realizes that this man has no income, no ambition, lives in a post-college frat house with 4 other man-children (insert penis joke here), and can't seem to say anything remotely intelligent or tactful, she improbably decides...""let me stick it out with this guy"", since she's been, yup, you guessed it, insert movie title here.<br/><br/>However, it is a broad comedy, so I suppose some leeway should be given (and this setup involves a LOT of leeway). But after it settles down in the 2nd hour, it becomes a really honest (and funny) portrait of adult responsibility and the headaches and joys that come with it. And this almost makes the first half worth sitting through for."
"javaman-7","Null","1","3","18 September 2007"," A sexy, vulgar, R-rated . . . family values film.
","Java Man Reviews ""Knocked Up"" (2007, R). Written and directed by Judd Apatow. Starring Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, Tim Bagley, Kristen Wiig & Loudon Wainwright III. Running Time: 129 minutes. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>Ben Stone (Rogan) is a 20-something slacker who, like his similarly unmotivated roommates, lives the life of a college kid without actually attending classes. Their big goal in life is to develop a website that will inform its users as to the exact location of nudity in any given movie. Alison Scott (Heigl) is an unsuccessful but ambitious 20-something broadcast staffer who lives with her bitchy older sister Debbie (Mann) and Debbie's weirdly wayward husband Pete (Rudd). When Alison gets her big break by being offered an on-camera gig with the E! Network, she decides to go out on the town to celebrate. After having too much to drink she meets Ben, accompanies him to his apartment, and unsafe sex ensues.<br/><br/>In the morning, seeing Ben in the full light of his dorkiness, she bids him farewell and is about to begin her new life as a minor media personality . . . until several weeks later when she discovers that Ben has left her with more than just memories. Do I have to spell it out? The movie's inelegant title says it all. The balance of the movie follows the mismatched couple's attempts to work out their newly altered lives.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS <br/><br/>Though I don't like this movie as much as most other reviewers seem to, I must admit that it has grown on me. When I first walked out of the theater, it bothered me that the film seems to say that it is okay for guys in their 20s to do nothing but drink beer and take hits on a bong, and that it's also okay for a 20-something couple to meet at a bar and have a one-night stand. But, thanks to a mix-up in a conversation about condoms, there are consequences; and when I look at this film in retrospect, it seems to be a sexy, vulgar, R-rated . . . family values film. Yet it doesn't come off as an anti-abortion polemic: she knows she has a choice and she chooses to have the baby.<br/><br/>But I'm getting way too serious here. The real reason to see this movie is because it's well-written and funny. Many of the scenes have a Borat-like quality of becoming even more humorous when you think about them later. Two examples are the conversation Ben has with his dad, and Ben's refusal to have sex with a frustrated Alison for fear of crushing the baby.<br/><br/>While Rogen may be an acquired taste, Heigl and the rest of the cast are right on the mark with Apatow's insightful material. Especially good are Mann as the judgmental sister and Wiig as Alison's subtly jealous rival.<br/><br/>As the story progresses into more conventional here-comes-the-baby territory, the editor might have considered performing some surgical snips well in advance of the cutting of the umbilical chord."
"film_riot","8","1","3","18 September 2007"," Knocked Up
","It's been a long time since I've last seen a really good romantic comedy. When you look at Hollywood's mainstream output in this genre recently you will discover oscitant boredom. One part of the key to Judd Apatow's success with ""Knocked Up"" is that it's rated R. Many rom-coms are just too harmless and children-friendly to find a way into the heart of the audience. Apatow also writes real characters, not only templates. This is obvious in the female main character Alison. She is elaborated very well, unusually well in a genre where the female lead often only has the task to look well. And the character is also acted very well by Katherine Heigl, who proves her movie qualities here. But also the male characters are very interesting, led by Seth Rogan's Ben. They are portrayed a bit hyperbolized, also for fun reasons, but the emotions are pretty real still. The result is a movie that's very funny with great characters, a good soundtrack and a few really true insights about relationships. That's pretty steep!"
"sambarb","9","1","3","10 September 2007"," Saw Knocked Up Twice!
","Seth, Catherine and supporting cast were great. Some comedies are spoofs that follow a boring formula. Knocked Up, had many original ideas.<br/><br/>Yes, men rise to the occasion, when an under employed guy meets a highly successful woman. The character of the woman is shown when she recognizes the guy to be a good guy and worth spending time with. At first she isn't sure of this, but is willing to give it a chance. Good men are hard to find, as are good women.<br/><br/>The character of the man is spurred to improve when he realizes that a bright and personable attractive woman is actually interested in him. And although sex is important to both, he grows up when he realizes there is much more to this than sex.<br/><br/>Kind of like a movie version of 'According to Jim', who recognizes that he married up!"
"colonel_green","9","1","3","4 September 2007"," Apatow is the king of crude but kind comedy
","Judd Apatow's movies have gained a reputation for being extremely vulgar and uncouth in their humour, while at the same time containing a core of genuine emotional weight and sympathy, and this has proved to be a winning combination with audiences, who have made three Apatow-backed, R-rated productions into 100+ million dollar hits in the last two years (although the third, ""Superbad"", has somewhat less involvement from Apatow himself, instead being a production made by his reliable company of actors, including Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill).<br/><br/>This, the second of the three Apatow films, takes Rogen, a supporting character from ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", and makes him the leading man, rather implausibly (on purpose) paired up with the beautiful and winning Katherine Heigl (""Grey's Anatomy""), who plays a beautiful up-and-coming reporter who is quite clearly out of Rogen's league (a similar situation was faced by the Seth character in ""Superbad"", incidentally). This sort of mismatched, accidental relationship has been done a thousand times before, but rarely this winningly. Rogen demonstrates promise as a real romantic lead, not just as a brilliant frat comedian, while Heigl makes her character's interest in Ben (Rogen's character) seem reasonable. Also notable in the supporting cast is the always-charming Paul Rudd, who plays Heigl's character's brother-in-law, whose marriage is a sort of worst-case-scenario for the movie's main couple.<br/><br/>Bonus points for Rogen playing an actual Canadian character on film, which one rarely sees when my country's great comics head south of the 49th Parallel."
"refresh_daemon","8","1","3","23 August 2007"," Could use more polish, but still very funny
","Judd Apatow did it again. Even better this time with this film. The story is pretty simple, girl and boy get wasted, have sex and girl gets pregnant. She decides to keep it and they start giving parenthood a shot, even though they are strangers to each other.<br/><br/>The conflicts are pretty obvious from the start: not knowing each other and being opposite each other as well. Of course the story is about these two people learning to fall in love (or very slowly learning what love is), with a baby bringing them together. And it has a large number of very funny moments, some working better than others.<br/><br/>There's a lot that carries over from The 40 Year Old Virgin and not all of it is good. Many of the players cross over from one film to this film, whether in major supporting roles or bit parts. The gross-out stoner comedy makes it into this one as well as the moments of real-to-life banter. And there's a surprising amount of heart stuck into this piece as well, which is all very good. I don't laugh when watching most comedies, so getting me laughing is a good sign for a comedy.<br/><br/>But some of the weaknesses from 40 Year Old Virgin also return for this film, including several scenes, which might be funny, but seem a little forced or unnecessary. These include many of the banter scenes which do seem a little artificial because, although they might have happened in the real life, these are not the scenes that we would remember in real life. Consequently, since they do not carry any dramatic thrust, it creates a sense of ""why am I watching this?"" Or at least it did in me. But it is far more natural and flows much better than 40, so I give it credit for improvement.<br/><br/>I think the movie could've been a little shorter with some of those scenes clipped and held a better pace. But nonetheless, the cast performs well, the story hits its marks, the direction overall is a little unspectacular, but it does what it needs to do. And it's funny. And I found Katherine Heigl surprising watchable in this film (surprising to me because I have a hard time believing her character (and most characters) in ""Grey's Anatomy"".<br/><br/>I do wish we had a stronger understanding of why Alison decides to keep the baby or got to see a little bit more of her perspective, since we primarily stick with Ben's side of the story. But mostly, I just wished that it was tighter. But that doesn't prevent this film from being highly enjoyable and a bit more than the usual mindless comedy fare in the genre it belongs to. So I recommend it. It's funny, it's got heart and I look forward to the next Apatow film to see where he goes from here. 8/10."

","Bawdy, foulmouthed, but very entertaining comedy that makes good use of the credible one-night stand scenario.

From the crew that brought audiences The 40-Year-Old Virgin this sex comedy has a foregone conclusion, with flip, vulgar dialogue that borders on excessive, but it still maintains its charm with a believable setup, engaging characters, and a likable cast. Not always on target, and maybe not for all tastes, but like its distant cousin The 40-Year-Old Virgin good-natured and very funny. ***"

","I had no idea who Judd Apatow was until this movie came out (shut...UP). Then I read the review for Knocked Up in Entertainment Weekly and People. Both gave the movie a great review and mentioned its constant, in-your-face realistic humor, which is a rare element in most comedies nowadays (the Chuck and Larry movie does NOT count). Intrigued, I went and saw Katherine Heigl shag Seth Rogen's stifler without protection (boo protection, yay beer!) and witnessed their physical (former) and mental (latter) transformations in the subsequent nine months. Saying the movie wasn't great would be criminal, but as I was laughing I had this slightly disturbing feeling in my gut. What hinders this movie from becoming a classic is the way it treats such a realistic, life-changing topic. Kramer vs. Kramer treated divorce with delicacy and poignance, but Knocked Up treated, well, being knocked up as if it's something that should be shrugged off and laughed about at a dinner party. ***"
"DeathByTelevision","7","1","3","17 June 2007"," Pretty good, far from great.
","Are we all so fed up with how bad comedies usually are that we're instantly calling this one of the greatest movies of all time? I like Judd Apatow's style, but Knocked Up mined a lot of the same territory as The 40 Year Old Virgin, and in a less original way. That movie's endearing exploration of freaks, geeks, and immature man/boys was tighter and funnier. Knocked Up was a bit too schmaltzy and meandering during it's 129 minutes. Many scenes and situations come straight from the generic pregnancy movie guidebook. Buying all the pregnancy tests in a store was funny 15 years ago in Singles, and if a filmmaker wanted to cop from John Hughes, She's Having a Baby isn't the greatest place to start. This was indeed an enjoyable movie, but it doesn't quite reach greatness."

","Knocked up ended up being a better movie then I thought it was going to be. But when I compare it to the best comedies, it would be middle of the road. I'm surprised the average movie critic grade is an A-. To me it is more of a B and nothing better than that.<br/><br/>I think a lot of critics liked it because of the cast, and they were quite good. Katherine Heigl, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann give very good performances, and the supporting cast is just as well, including the Seth Rogen character's loser buddies. They were all interesting in their own right.<br/><br/>The gags and gross out jokes, along with the cast, manage to keep the movie interesting for a comedy that is over two hours long. Yes I'll admit I was never bored with the movie, but I did not crack up in guffaws of laughter like some of the better comedies use to make me do.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, a guy and girl meet, get drunk, have sex without a condom, and a few months later girl discover's she's pregnant. She wants to raise the baby and loser boy dad decides that he's on board with her. The story goes from there, and you can fill in the usual plot details.<br/><br/>I liked the movie. Like I said it was entertaining and the cast was incredible, but the story was nothing new. I also liked the dialoque and some of the inside jokes, but an average grade of A- by critics, and 8.4 out of 10 on IMDb? No, that's a little too high. 7 out of 10."

","I see a lot of movies that come out, even the ones that sound stupid, immature, and full of slapstick, inappropriate humor. ""Kocked Up"" is all of the above.<br/><br/>But it makes for one heck of a hilarious movie! When I first heard of this movie, I never thought it would have as much swearing, drug use, and sex that it does. The rating it received (R for mild language, sexual content, and drug references) sounded like a PG-13 rating. So, obviously I would go see it. It turns out, though that it was rated R for several very good reasons not mentioned. If I had to make a personal comment, a proper rating would have been R for ""heavy language, sexual content, nudity, drug references, drug use, and crude humor"". I still would've gone to see it, though.<br/><br/>This was a hilarious movie with good okay plot lines, stupidity, and a few moments of sense. This contained many hilarious jokes and things that people might actually say. One of my personal favourites was ""Are you the lady who doesn't know she's pregnant until she's sitting on the toilet and the baby pops out?"" Anyone who can come up with that can come up with a hilarious movie. The movie ""Knocked Up"" is hilarious with ""Grey's Anatomy"" Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Seth Rogan, and Jason Segel. All of these actors had spectacular performances, portraying their characters as if they were actually them. <br/><br/>Although, there is something that many people have not realized. In this movie, the people are portrayed like ""bitches"" and the way that they are always portrayed in California movies. The thing is, there are many people who actually act like this! It makes for a realistic movie, too! In conclusion and overall, I really enjoyed the movie ""Knocked Up"" and I think a lot of other people might. It really depends on you view of things. Although, as a side note, I really do think that younger children should NOT see this movie. It has many inappropriate scenes and happenings and words... and lets be honest, no one wants to drag any kid between the ages of 0-14 (at least) into that. I guess that depends on you, though.<br/><br/>Happy movie-going. *Magic Jar Of Dirt*"

"finding-something","8","1","3","4 June 2007"," Vulgar Romantic Comedy? Perfection.
","Bringing out the ugly! What really makes this film great and uncomfortable and funny is how it lets us see ourselves. In only a few moments Ben Stone is transformed from sweetly funny stoner into a shouting, mean-spirited, insensitive child. Pete retreats selfishly from a wife, Debbie who suffocates him with insane, but strangely familiar, expectations. All the players at some point become irrational, and this is where Alison (Hiegl's character) escapes criticism. Because she is pregnant, any outburst, any unmotivated action is easily excused, and ironically, she may have the fewest anyway. She's still Izzy from Grey's Anatomy, but without the self-righteousness. She's the ideal, a little vanilla, and a little hard to identify with, but in a good way.<br/><br/>Despite Rogen's and Hiegl's competence, it's the little characters that really make this film shine. Leslie Mann, Alison's older sister, somehow seems like both a potentially wonderful mother and potential basket case. She teeters on greatness and disaster and I love and identify with her for it. Jason Segel, whose turn on CBS's How I Met Your Mother is nothing short of phenomenal, shines here as a slacker friend, unfoundedly cocky, and somehow endearing. He effortlessly controls the screen.<br/><br/>Most wonderful, though, is Paul Rudd's Pete. I've never seen a character like him animated on the screen. After attempting just now several times, it's impossible to describe what's with this character. I guess there's a kind of absent, off-hand responsibility to him that just makes for compelling screen time. An Oscar worthy performance that, sadly, will never manifest in a nomination because of the kind of movie this is.<br/><br/>The film is undeniably funny on all levels. There are jokes ranging from the sophisticated pokes at pop culture, to the almost mandatory fart joke. I will say, that even the fart\poop references manage to be original and hilarious. Is the humor crude? Yes, and somehow not quite inappropriate either. We're eavesdropping on funny people with their most intimate friends. Thank you Mr. Apataw for letting us listen in."
"diac228","8","1","3","2 June 2007"," The cast behind recent ""frat pack"" adult comedies deliver yet again with another vulgar yet charming comedy
","Anti-PG-13 folks rejoice; there is yet another enjoyable R-rated romantic comedy that is both vulgar and sweet at the same time, while embracing the restricted rating rather than try too hard to receive it. From the writer and director of the awesome sleeper hit The 40-Year Old Virgin comes another film about relationships and the fickle business surrounding it. While this isn't as charming or as funny as the 2005 hit that helped revive the genre of adult comedies, it still contains a heavy dosage of laughs, plenty of insightful commentary about society, and its little bit of bittersweet moments that lightens the mood of the film.<br/><br/>Knocked Up is about two very different people that meet at a bar and engage in a one-night stand. Their moment together was supposed to be the first and only time they would see each other, but upon pregnancy tests it is revealed that Ben Stone (Seth Rogan) and Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) are going to become parents. They now have several months to get to know each other, attempt to be in a relationship for the baby; despite the circumstances and less-than-helpful insight from another couple related to Allison (Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd). Can a carefree jobless druggie and a hard-working yet unsure interviewer bond together for the child they have decided to introduce to the world? The plot, while very believable, doesn't always tread down a path of predictability.<br/><br/>The bittersweet symphony that is Knocked Up can be traced to the excellent acting staff that can portray emotions as well as deliver improvised one-liners. The main couple in this movie, Rogan and Heigl were perfectly cast and despite their obvious differences were able to have plenty of chemistry together. However, Seth Rogan and all his roommates (Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, and Martin Starr) provide almost all the jokes and laughs throughout this movie. The gags and one-liners from the roomies range from chuckles to uncontrollable laughter. Last but not least portraying the troubled couple, Mann and Rudd did a superb job on their own being everything the character Allison did not want in her life.<br/><br/>While the casting is what excels best here, the writing and directing of rising powerhouse Judd Apatow (Virgin, Fun With Dick and Jane, Anchorman, Talladega Nights, even Heavyweights) is a big help as well. Being able to combine crude jokes, sex jokes, with commentary and light drama isn't easy, but like his previous work, Apatow succeeds. While his directing isn't groundbreaking, he knows how to maintain the pace and knows how to handle shots when the actors are in their improvising moods. He doesn't dazzle with any amazing-looking shots and angles, but maintains the humor throughout the picture, which not everyone in Hollywood can do nowadays.<br/><br/>Where this film loses points is in the editing. Surely there are great moments throughout, but there are many moments that were not necessary, that could have been cut without damaging the quality of the movie. The jokes stop flying once the third act begins, which is around the same time then the movie begins to drag. Fortunately though, it doesn't last too long as we see the funny cast together again for the climax, and then the charming ending that doesn't overstay its welcome.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Fans of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and other works from this new unnamed frat pack that consists of Rogan, Rudd, Mann, Apatow will be pleased with Knocked Up. It is a superbly written comedy with great dialogue, many funny gags, a good chunk of improvisation, and a bit of heart. The acting, writing and directing is great, but unfortunately is marred by rather weak editing. Don't let that bring you down, because the cast makes up for the shortcomings in the cutting process and the running time allowed (over 2 hours for a romantic comedy is rather long). Apatow is beginning to leave a mark on Hollywood, and his cast of actors and actresses are breathing fresh life into a genre that faded into obscurity in the 1990s. These movies are becoming this generation's Caddyshack, National Lampoon's Vacation, Stripes, and Animal House. For anyone giving up hope on Hollywood, this is the silver lining that you should see so you can see the light to the end of the mediocrity tunnel."
"StevePulaski","10","1","4","11 June 2013"," One big, laundry list of ethics-questions with enormous sprinklings of humor
","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is the definition of a guy who ""means well,"" but is also the definition of a total geek. He's sweet and sincere, but hopelessly unromantic in his many episodes of pot-smoking, dirty jokes, and vulgarity. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is an employee for the E! TV network, who is extremely career-minded, especially after she finally gets the job interviewing celebrities on air. Only at a club after too many drinks would these people ever meet and have sex, and fate says that they do, and fate includes that they wake up the next morning with almost no memory of what happened the night before.<br/><br/>Ben and Alison proceed to get breakfast, before hesitantly exchanging numbers and going about their ways. Ben clearly wants Alison to like him, but she seems passively repulsed by, what she sees, as vacuous immaturity. Regardless, eight weeks later, Alison begins throwing up at work, unpredictably, and rushes home to take a pregnancy test. Well, dozens of pregnancy tests, aided by her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd). She is in fact pregnant and then tracks down Ben through his homemade, film-nudity-tracking website to inform of this occurrence. Now, both lives are enormously affected by one small mistake and the two of them must try and survive the labors (no pun intended) of pregnancy and the stress that comes with it.<br/><br/>This doesn't sound like the makings of a four-star comedy, but I assure you, reader, it is. Judd Apatow's Knocked Up is one of the most fun comedies I've seen in a while, perfectly amplifying, while simultaneously furthering the genre of raunch-with-heart. This isn't the nihilistic, hopelessly cynical comedy one would anticipate, but rather a sweet comedy, with strong sprinklings of raunchiness, all encapsulated with a shell of poignancy and life-revelations.<br/><br/>Only in a great comedy are the supporting characters just as good as the lead characters and there are a plethora of talents in Knocked Up. From Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Jason Segel, and Martin Starr all doing a terrific job at playing Ben's sardonic best friends, there are Debbie and Paul, the only real married couple in the film. Debbie and Paul - who got their own feature film five years after Knocked Up - deal with marital issues that are likely normative in the married life of couples today. Debbie believes in a very controlled, disciplined way of governing her husband and their two children, while Paul believes in a more relaxed, laidback way of parenting. This causes, as expected, an uproar in their marriage, and also causes a pleasant ethics debate for the audience. Is Debbie's disciplining helping or hurting the family? Is Pete in the right position to be sort of ""taking nights off from the family?"" Come to think of it, Knocked Up, as a whole, is one big ethics question. A ""what would you do?"" question appears every few minutes for the audience to answer, and thankfully, the presence of the questions doesn't overshadow the humor or vice-versa. Aside from being just another comedy that provides roughly two hours of pleasant escapism, Knocked Up, in retrospect, provides roughly two hours of marital questions and situations, while combining in the humor to seem more like a presentable package.<br/><br/>The winning ingredient for Knocked Up is definitely its heart and its smart focus on the poignancy of pregnancy, especially that of a one-night stand. While this in particular is a rare case, it is nonetheless a realistic one, provided by strong instances of comedy and, yet, strong instances of sadness and sorrow. The scene when Ben and Alison find out their reckless night of debauchery results in a pregnancy is downright soul-crushing, even though you know it's coming. In the blink of an eye, both lives are changed and they're changed so much that the only response is to cry.<br/><br/>And yet, there are scenes of pure hilarity and fun. Take for example the scene when Alison first meets Ben's goofball friends, or when an unexpected earthquake hits, or even the subplot involving a bet that Martin Starr's character can't shave his beard for the entire year. While Knocked Up tackles some brutally honest notions and occurrences in the lives of pregnant couples and married people, it nevertheless shows the fun side of life. What some of this all boils down to is nerds having fun being nerds.<br/><br/>Knocked Up is more-or-less a roller-coaster, as the real world often is. There are ups, there are downs, there is unconditional happiness, there is unconditional sadness. The humanity the film evokes is nearly nonexistent in the mainstream comedies today, but writer/director/co-producer Apatow knows married life, knows the quirks and hilarity in certain situations, and also knows the time when to be downright realistic and, well, sad. His material from this point looked as if he could only evolve and he certainly did. He is one of the strongest comedy-writers and directors working today.<br/><br/>Starring: Seth Rogen. Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Jason Segel, and Martin Starr. Directed by: Judd Apatow."
"zardoz-13","8","1","4","1 January 2013"," Funny As Hell
","Writer-director Judd Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" qualifies as a hilarious comedy about heterosexual relationships. Moreover, it is about taking responsibility for one's actions. Polar opposites meet, and the woman winds up pregnant. They struggle together to commit to their future child, but life is no picnic for them. A female television production assistant celebrates her promotion by taking the guy who bought her a beer home to indulge into the dirty deed. He misunderstands her in a drunken hormonal frenzy and shirks a condom. Eight weeks later, the truth clobbers them like a sledgehammer. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are cast as products from two wholly different cultures. As Ben Stone, Rogen plays a twenty-three year old Canadian-born stoner living illegally in Los Angeles off the loot he won from a court settlement over an accident. When he hooks up with Allison, Ben has $900 left in the bank. He is living with five other guys and collaborating on an Internet website called Flesh of the Stars. The last thing that Ben thought possible was having sex with a cute babe chick. Allison Scott works on the staff of E!, the Entertainment Show. The last thing Allison was prepared for is conceiving a child by a guy who she has never seen before she met him in a bar trying to get a brew from the bartender. They are drawn together by the circumstances of the pregnancy. Allison refuses to use her sister's gynecologist and searches for her own. Meanwhile, when Apatow isn't focusing on the stormy relationship between Allison and Ben, he is dealing with the trials and tribulations of Pete and Debbie Scott. Paul Rudd and Mrs. Judd Apatow Leslie Mann fill those roles with panache. Debbie is a possessive wife and Pete has problems with her dominance. The cast is absolutely perfect, and Kristen Wigg steals every scene in which she appears."
"Jackpollins","10","1","4","11 August 2009"," Extremely funny and also greatly touching
","I saw The 40-Year Old Virgin, and when I saw Seth Rogen, I thought he was funny, but did not see him as one of the funniest people out there. Now, Knocked Up came around, and I saw just how funny Rogen is. Here he plays slacker Ben, who has a one-night stand with innocent hard worker Allison (Katherine Heigl). Soon, Allison figures out she's pregnant. Ben has to then unexpectedly step in and take charge knowing he is soon going to be a father. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd generate a ton of laughs as couple Debbie and Pete. They are Allison's sister and her husband. Both Allison & Ben, and Debbie & Pete generate some very funny and also sweet moments as they struggle through couple hood. People like Jason Segel, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Mike Starr, and Charlyne Yi are hilarious as Ben's slacker friends. It's great to see a raunchy comedy that's not aggressive but indeed very sweet. This really is a great film, mixing very funny jokes and touching drama to make a film that could of been a complete failure, and instead is a very sweet and extremely funny film."
"hedin_88","6","1","4","25 August 2008"," pretty realistic... not much of a comedy
","This is one of those movies you just don't know where to put it or what to think of it. Was it really good, or bad...? Well, the thing is here that the movie has a good idea seen many times before. you know- two people have sex and the girl ends up being pregnant. I've seen like 3 or 4 movies like this but its ""Knocked up"" that will be the first one on that list. (""Juno"" being second) A good touch is not just the clash of two people that barely know each other but she clash of worlds. You also might be pulled away form the main two characters and by the end of the movie you wont be able to know the difference between the main and the supporting cast. The humor is also something that must be spoken about. Its Seth Rogen who you laugh at and none else. Maybe its because the movie tries (and manages) to keep a serious impression and not end up being just another stupid comedy. If so, its good but still, Ben Stone (thats Seth Rogen in case you didn't know) holds all the funny lines along with his roommates while on the other hand all you get from the rest of the characters is seriosity. Now, YES, its a comedy but not just that. Its pretty good with a storyline hat you know how it will end but still, it has those little turns that make the road to the end of the movie unpredictable. So if you're in for a couple of laughs- go ahead, if you're in for a serious story- go ahead. If you're in for the action- nope... wait! Its a nice and balanced movie. Go see it, if nothing- you'll remember to put a condom on next time."
"matrix29","10","1","4","27 June 2008"," Great movie, hits all the targets brilliantly
","Normal guys are not constantly serious. Men have hopes, dreams, fears, the need to relax, and lots of illusions of how things might be. Watching ""Knocked Up"" really makes me see the Judd Apatow was not the cause of ""Don't Mess With the Zohan"" being an unfunny unentertaining bore-fest. Judd Apatow's writing and direction in this movie keeps the scene pacing clean and the movie flows smoothly to each plot point. Judd makes each character believable with interesting complexities. Judd Apatow has a highly introspective mind which can detail the personalities of a person so that the viewer relates to the unspoken thoughts reflected in the faces of the brilliant actors & actresses.<br/><br/>The characters were a bit generic in design, but perfectly fit this movie pitched to an audience of men deciding whether to commit to a marriage and raising an unexpected child.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays the non-serious guy wanting a life of easy pleasure and no responsibility. Katherine Heigl plays the funny sexy idealized wonderful girlfriend (bizarrely ignorant of popular entertainment) who is okay with the non-serious guy, but starts needing a guy who can be reliable and trustworthy when the baby is due. Paul Rudd plays the pussy-whipped husband who is highly reliable and has a good-paying job, but is slowly dying inside from his over-bearing snippy constantly judgmental nightmare wife. Leslie Mann has the hardest role here as ""The Nightmare Wife"" in that she plays the shrew wife which unforgivably picks at constant irrelevant flaws because she is scared and bored and unhappy and unable to deny she is getting older as well as slightly less attractive. However, Leslie Mann's character is also highly supportive of her sister and she is serious and focused about dealing with life's difficulties and is thusly a highly desirable woman of character to have around even if she is an unreasonable highly demanding witch for 90% of her life. Leslie Mann has the hardest character to play because she will be the one that everyone is programmed to hate (note that she is ACTING and this character should not be considered to be the real life Leslie Mann in the same way that Ron Perlman is not a superhero demon or an alien or a circus strongman).<br/><br/>The only flaw I can find with the movie is the problem of people doing whatever they desire and then dealing with the consequences haphazardly afterward (as this was the punchline to the movie ""Idiocracy""). However, life happens that way and this movie sells the idea that even though the circumstances are not ideal, they are tolerable and common and workable no matter how much they do not mesh with your dreams and plans.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie for viewing even though it is a sales pitch."
"Sabalon","6","1","4","12 April 2008"," Not hilarious, but good movie
","I went into this expecting something like Superbad - a bunch of vulgar humor I'd enjoy in high school. While I did laugh here and there, the style of the movie was more of a story of someone who got knocked up after one night and how things progressed.<br/><br/>Yes, the trivia mentions certain words being used over 120+ times. However, the dialog sounded very natural for the type of people involved. I could imagine having some of the dialog in the situations with some of my friends.<br/><br/>I'm not that sure what I think of Seth Rogan as an actor. There are some good moments, but overall it just seemed to feel too improvised. Katherine Heigl does a wonderful job as a stressed out mom-to-be.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good movie. I can see where people going in expecting a laugh out loud comedy based on the ads would be upset. But if you want what is basically a natural flowing love story with some comedy and overzealous F word usage, you'll love it."

","With a film going by the title of Knocked Up, from the makers of The 40 Year Old Virgin, I was expecting a unsophisticated-but-fun laugh-a-minute film packed with hilariously crude jokes. What I got, however, was an unsophisticated, occasionally funny, romantic comedyShe's Having a Baby for the new millennium.<br/><br/>And whilst it was okay for what it was, I felt rather cheated. All I wanted was a vulgar comedy about sex. I had been tricked into seeing a vulgar comedy about sex that also explored emotions, fears and the uncertainty of life.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a 23 year old waster whose 'job' is to record nudity in movies for a website (that isn't even online yet). On a drunken night out, he somehow hooks up with gorgeous TV presenter Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl). After a single night of passion, the two go their separate ways. That is until Alison discovers that she is up the duff! At over two hours long, Knocked Up soon gets tiresome, with not enough genuine laughs to help the time fly. And although Rogen and Heigl make a likable couple, endless scenes of arguing followed by reconciliation followed by more arguing really gets tedious.<br/><br/>And, for the record, Katherine Heigl displays no boobs and definitely no bush, despite several sex scenes.

"teh_mode","7","1","4","13 September 2007"," The comedy of the year
","Inside every great dumb gross-out comedy is a smarter film just waiting burst out of that film's womb. In the case of Knocked Up, we have a movie that presents itself in the American Pie tradition of fart gags and sex jokes, but that has aspirations to higher levels of cinematic purity. LEvels where it isn't just teenage boys who are given permission to laugh at the screen. Or indeed teenagers at all. Judd Apatow, the film's director, is more Woody Allen than Porky's revenge. His movie's are filled with observational humour, cultural and societal situations and questions of morality when pregnancy is concerned. How should a man finally ""man up"" when it is time to play the role of daddy-to-be, especially when his whole existence seems so peripheral, his claim to fame is a working part-time on a website that allows to find which movies your favourite actresses have been nude in?<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays Ben, a podgy, unemployed stoner-slob who lives in an apartment with four other similar friends. When at a club one night, he meets Alison, a recently-promoted TV presenter, who is initially charmed by the lovable oaf. Several empty beer bottles later, they end up spending the night together, only to discover their real personalities the morning after. During breakfast, Alison soon becomes repulsed by Ben's oafish opinions and demeanour, and soon decides it is best to leave the situation as a one night stand. Several weeks later Alison discovers she is pregnant, and decides to keep the baby. Without much thought into how she might achieve such a feet, she decides to give Ben another chance, for the sake of the baby, to make a relationship work between them.<br/><br/>The great achievement of Knocked Up is that it is a comedy for adults, that has not been dumbed down for kids. Yes there are many crude jokes, similar to the filmmaker's previous effort - The 40 year Old Virgin. But the crudeness is shown up for what it is, and Ben's slacker routine is not glorified over Alison's sensibility. This is a movie where, like American Pie, the women have someone to look up to just like the men do. And a year in which American comedies have sunk so low that Will Ferrell is considered high-end, it is refreshing to see a new breed of smart filmmakers come out to give rebirth to the dumb comedy genre."

"stefanbe","9","1","4","26 July 2007"," Very funny and very sweet as well!
","Judd Apatow's first film took the simple idea of a 40 year old virgin and expanded it into a sweet and funny tale that was more than just a one-joke movie. His second film Knocked Up takes a more realistic route by showing what would happen if a one-night stand actually made somebody pregnant. Yet, like The 40 Year Old Virgin, Apatow knocks it out of the park, proving that he could rival Mel Brooks as the best living comedic filmmaker in North America. What pushes this film above the typical R-rated sex comedy is the fact that Apatow spends just as much time creating a believable script as he does bringing the audience to uncontrollable laughter. He also fills the screen with likable actors, who bring plenty of charisma to Knocked Up. Without them, it certainly wouldn't have been the same film.<br/><br/>Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is an unemployed slacker, who just enjoys smoking marijuana and developing a website on film pornography. Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) has just been promoted by E! News to be an on-air anchorwoman and to celebrate, she goes to a night club with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). There, she gets drunk and meets Ben and they both go home and sleep together. After parting ways the following morning, Allison calls Ben a couple of weeks later to announce that she is pregnant with his child. Deciding against having an abortion, the two bachelors try to get to know each other and sure enough (as this is a Hollywood film), the two grow very close. Meanwhile, there is a subplot involving Debbie and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd), who is beginning to get bored of his marriage and soon forms a bond with Ben. As mentioned before, this is a Hollywood film, but doesn't completely follow the typical format of an American romantic comedy and that is where the film succeeds above similar films.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow, much like he did with The 40 Year Old Virgin, pushes the limits of his ""R"" rating and goes all the way, showing absolutely everything. Not only are there the usual breast shots and profanity-laced rants heard in R-rated sex comedies, but also hundreds of uses of drugs (smoked in ways I have never seen before), vomiting and ""doggie-style."" There is even a pregnancy scene that shows that you don't need $250 million to create realistic special effects. Yet, among the crude scenes, there are also those sweet moments which Apatow manages to keep from getting over-long and sappy. The scenes between Rogen and Heigl certainly display Apatow's ability to write great romantic dialogue, but this is surprisingly proved even more so in the parts where Rogen and Rudd converse. The more time that Ben spends with Pete, the more it dawns on him what the future will be like for him when he and Allison have a family. Even though it is not shown on screen, we can tell through all of the subtle gestures that Ben thinks he will be as boring and lifeless as Pete has become.<br/><br/>This, of course, leads to why the film is such a major success: the performances. Apatow does not cast any devilishly handsome fellows in the roles and the actors he chooses are natural and manage to slide in their parts easily. Seth Rogen is not a De Niro or a Nicholson and nor does he need to be. He gives Ben a likable persona and even after two hours, we're still not tired of him. Ben is thrust into a situation that many people go through and Rogen doesn't play the part as over the top. He is crude and vulgar when he needs to be and he is sweet and charming when necessary. Katherine Heigl is a good match-up with Rogen, as she allows us to believe she actually is pregnant and not an actress in a fat suit. The character changes throughout the film, due to hormones and cravings, and Heigl plays it very well. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd give ample support as the film's only married couple and they're both hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time.<br/><br/>For me, the comic delights of the film are the four actors playing Ben's best friends. All of them most likely playing themselves, Apatow doesn't overdo them and they don't enter the scene when un-needed. They are the tasty side dish to Rogen and Heigl's steak. Harold Ramis, Steve Carell, Ryan Seacrest and James Franco drop in as well for some very funny cameo appearances. Their scenes are short so they don't overstay their welcomes. Apatow gives them a rant and they're on their way. Knocked Up is one of those rare modern American comedies that manages to be both side-splitting and heart-breaking and without using the aide of humongous visual effects and is certainly worth the price of admission."

","Knocked Up exceeded my expectations. Horrible memories of my own pregnancy and delivery resurfaced as I watched Alison and Ben struggle through their experience together. It made me laugh to think that other women must have the same awful experiences with pregnancy that I did, and it made the movie that much better for me.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd, Katherine Heigl, and Seth Rogen have a surprisingly appropriate chemistry together, and the film was cast perfectly. <br/><br/>This film was a must-see for all pregnant couples, or anyone who has a sick sense of humor.

","Knocked Up was somewhat of a pleasant surprise for me. I came to see the movie because of Seth Rogen's awesome performance in 40 Year Old Virgin, and I expected him to do even better. Rogen did live up to my expectations. Seeing some guys from freaks & geeks was a pleasant surprise, but of course that is the genius of Judd Apatow. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann provided for a lot of humor. Their characters hate/love relationship added some good, substantial, humor. The leading lady (Katherine Heigl) was alright too. <br/><br/>Overall this film really helped provide for some long lasting laughs.Initially when you see the movie you might laugh a little at some of the less appreciated lines, but some time later you find yourself saying things like,""Luke I am your stoner,"" or,""I won't say it, but it rhymes with shmashmortion,"" and my favorite,""No I'm just really hiiigh.""

When Ben gives Alison his beer to give to her sister, a simple act of desperate charity turns into a friendly meeting, which turns into a crazy night of drunken dancing and partying, which turns into what was supposed to be a one-night stand. Eight weeks later, however, after getting sick on air, Alison discovers the horrifying truth: she's pregnant. The challenge of hiding the pregnancy from her workplace is nothing compared to the challenge of transforming Ben from a ""self-employed"" couch potato into a responsible father, and both parties learn a lot from the trials they go through.<br/><br/>This movie succeeds on so many levels, which is what makes it one of the best film of the year. The comedy is just as sharp, without being as flat-out crude, as the ""40-Year Old Virgin""; it almost seems smarter. Most of the funniest elements of the movie come from what is being said quickly and in the background, forcing you to pay attention to everything that is being said out of fear that you'll miss a joke. It works, though, in making people laugh more and more as they gradually comprehend what they just heard, and these jokes are the funniest.<br/><br/>Where it truly succeeds, however, is the underlying reality of the situation. You can truly believe that two people would go through a situation like this, and it would happen exactly the same way as in the movie. The issue with Debbie and Pete is also very real, and is a perfect scenario to freak Alison and Ben out about their relationship together. Nothing in this movie seems unnecessary, nothing seems over-the-top, and as weird as it gets towards the end it all still fits together. The culmination of nearly two hours of stress, fights, and pregnant sex is the birth of the child, the only part of the movie that I felt was a little, how should I say it... shocking. However, with the birth of the child relieving all of the negative feelings from the entire movie, so comes the birth of a classic romantic comedy, sure to be loved for years. 10/10"

","Yeah, I can see what other people are saying. Judd Apatow definitely does have a sense for honest-to-life dialog, especially where his male characters are concerned. ""Knocked Up"" is a generally funny, worthy two hour film about a common mistake and how it manages to bring two people together despite their differences.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan and Katherine Heigl both do their jobs admirably, and for once a comedy of this type actually has supporting acts relatively worth something. This is a very open type of comedy, there's a little bit of humor for a lot of different dispositions. Never does the druggy humor or the whole point of Rogan as unattractive slob ever degenerate to simple stupid ""Mook"" humor, and never do their worries fall into simple hysterics--the obvious approaches to this film. Instead, it's a much more natural, straightforward form of situation comedy that is relatable to a huge demographic of people.<br/><br/>Now the question remains, is this a film with any lasting power? As it were, the movie itself is a finely crafted piece of work that is also so quiet and honest that it might not really stick out in people's memories at all. ""Knocked Up"" is definitely an at-the-moment type of movie, indicated by such things as its contemporary technology humor (""I Google'd 'murder'"") and the whole Internet-start-up subplot (""Like Mr. Skin?"" was what I was thinking too). I ended up paying 9 bucks to see it... it was probably worth more around 6.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","The latest film in the resurrection of R-rated comedies does what it should, but doesn't do much else. There were many instances that I could identify with what the characters were going through. But in the end, the heart that was present in 40-year old Virgin was in short supply here.<br/><br/>All the leads and supporting characters do a very good job, but it is the same thing we have seen from this group previously. I would have liked to seen a little more exploration outside the world of slacker pot smokers. But this seems to be a comfort zone, but one that is running the course quickly. Seth Rogen is very believable as the lumpy pot head slacker who ultimately grows up.....just enough to win the girl. Katherine Heigl is very good as the hottie who makes a mistake, but instead of running the other direction gives our shlump a chance to be a dad and be her mate for life.<br/><br/>Apatow seems to have this genre down, I just hope we don't continue to see the same thing being recycled over and over."

The finish product was clean, though somewhat method, a little familiar, but the overall material was totally fresh; giving us a deeper glimpse into the American relationship experience. I'm sure his next film will deal with marriage or when the children finally leave the nest; I'm sure I'll be waiting in line and buying tickets. Seth Rogen can not act. The premise behind this film was easy to execute but Rogen seemed challenged and overwhelmed; it's as if he has the same expressions for all his emotions, extremely 1 dimensional. Katherine Heigl delivered an awesome performance; she was so hot in this movie. I would definitely rob banks for her devotion and if she had my child....that would be cool. Her emotional depth comes across with beautiful intensity in her acting, penetrating, directly to the heart; I was excited and stimulated all at once. Jonah Hall was definitely the MVP of this film in my opinion; it's a shame he didn't get the lead part but I'm sure that's the politics of Hollywood. He is so assessable, mutating into that kid you grew up with and knew your whole life. Overall this movie will definitely take your mind off of whatever is bothering you and have you cheering for the underdog. A very bankable comedy. I would've heavily invested in this smash hit."

And, then I found a woman, who had a real job and was not content to live on cheap thrills and silly male self-indulgence.<br/><br/>This is the lifestyle, also, of Seth Rogen in this film, when he encounters Katherine Heigl as a young woman, who is celebrating a new job at a bar. Seth, even though he is overweight and not exactly mature, comes on to her. They wind up in bed. Eight weeks later, she calls him with the news that she is pregnant.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Seth has to grow up fast and lose the marijuana habit, so that he can support his woman and his fast-arriving little baby. Like Sleeping Beauty, Seth's maturation, as a potential husband and father, suddenly has to quicken from its long slumber. And, Seth is as amazed as the viewers are, when all these mature feelings suddenly spring to life, like a flower that reaches its time to bloom.<br/><br/>Another touching part of this film is the realistic depiction of pregnancy and childbirth. So soon after another pregnancy film, Waitress, this film focuses, this time, more on the male side of the mating dance, just in time for Father's Day.

I could see the evolution of Ben Stone into an ""adult"" male. He begins as an immature guy who is only interested in sex, alcohol, smoking pot, and hanging out with his roommates making vulgar jokes. When faced with the unexpected pregnancy, he still doesn't get it. He thinks he can continue as he has before and doesn't expect anything to change. Eventually, when one might almost give up hope, he finally grows up. It does give you a sense of hope that some of the most immature males might become responsible adults."

"gregsrants","7","1","4","6 June 2007"," One of the funnier films of the year
","There's nothing funny about getting someone pregnant after a one night stand.<br/><br/>Or is there? Knocked Up, the new comedy from the creative mind of Judd Apatow who brought us the very funny The 40-Year-Old Virgin just over a year ago, is funny, touching, hilarious and in one scene  gross, all culminating in what is the funniest movie since.well, since The 40-Year-Old Virgin.<br/><br/>The premise is summed up in the two word title, but let me try and expand on it just a little bit. It all starts when the beautiful Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) meets the Shrek-ish Ben Stone (Seth Rogan) at a bar where she is out with sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) looking for nothing more than a good time and a few laughs. The good time and good laughs come alright, but so does copious amounts of alcohol that eventually lead the two opposites back at Alison's house and where a miscommunication regarding the usage of a condom leads in a revelation some eight weeks later.<br/><br/>The movie drifts between high emotional drama and belly laughs as the beauty and beast try and get to know each other while friend and family influences on both sides of the argument voice opinions and trade quips leading to the eventual birthing scene in the films final reel.<br/><br/>There is so much to like about Knocked Up that it is hard to know where to start. Like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Apatow is able to make the audience genuinely care for the characters and their plights while surrounding them with a supporting cast that adds to much of the humor quotient of the film.<br/><br/>What I liked best about the film was the dialogue between the characters. There is joy, confusion, anger and happiness all scattered in and around situations that every day folk like ourselves can relate to (as opposed to say, Ocean's 13). For instance, the sheer shock of hearing that Alison is pregnant, Ben retorts, ""With a baby?"" Sure, it may sound stupid, but think of what the first unsuspecting words might be coming out of your mouth if slapped in the face with a life changing occurrence.<br/><br/>And if I liked the dialogue I really really appreciated the supporting team, in particular Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd who play sister-in-law-to-Alison Debbie and her husband Pete. Mann is a quick witted, sharp, tongue spearing pessimist that thinks her husband is cheating on her. Her biting words remind me of a young Elizabeth Perkins and Paul Rudd does a fantastic job of giving us a character that is vulnerable and trapped in a family of children and responsibility.<br/><br/>For all my praise, there are a few drawbacks which keep the film from accepting a 4+ star review rating. A sequence including magic mushrooms at a performance of Cirque in Vegas could have fell to the cutting room floor without much impact and at two hours and twenty nine minutes, it is hard for the comedic punches to maintain their open wounds.<br/><br/>But, if you get through the roller-coaster ride and find yourself still invested in interest by the time the crowning scene rolls along, you will undoubtedly have enjoyed yourself and in the mix of explosions and car chases this summer, that is a definite good thing.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"

Most of us have been there, but this is an interesting view on how someone else might get there.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great way to spend a couple of hours with the one you love.

","I was quite disappointed. I guess I didn't especially like Virgin when I first saw it, but it's grown on me, and I like it a lot more now. So I had high hopes for this one. And it didn't reach them. It was funny, sure, but not nearly as much as I thought it would be. There were a lot of awkward moments, where I wasn't sure if I should laugh or not; it seemed really mean-spirited at times. It was also far too long. A big chunk of it could have been shaved off and it would have helped greatly. There are a fair share of laugh-out-loud moments, and certainly some memorable characters, but there's far too much going on in this movie at once. There's the main pregnancy, but then there's Ben's stoner friends, Alison's job, the other married couple and their problems, Ben and Pete's friendship, etc. A lot of it just distracted from the main story. And the crowning scene - what the hell? Totally out of nowhere. I laughed a lot, but also felt uneasy a lot of the time. The acting is good, and it's competently made, but it's all over the place a lot of the time. Pretty disappointing."

Breakout performances from Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogan, and an excellent supporting cast featuring Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann. Very Sandler-esquire in its charm and appeal. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud so many times during a movie. Special credit is due Heigl and Rogan for making the geek-gets-the-girl storyline believable."
"DICK STEEL","10","2","13","21 July 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Knocked Up
","Writer-director Judd Apatow is probably best known for last year's sleeper hit comedy The 40 Year Old Virgin, where Steve Carrell played the titular character whose friends tried to get him laid. In Knocked Up, most of the familiar faces in Virgin returns for Apatow's latest offering, this time with Seth Rogen cast as one of the protagonists who has his hands full when he learns that he's going to be a father. But here's the catch - the pregnancy is totally unplanned, and was a result of a drunken one-night stand.<br/><br/>Knocked Up is fertile (pardon the pun) ground for comedy, and Apatow's script, while it doesn't have much slapstick, turns it on by having plenty of winning dialogue, as the film chronicles the entire 9 months of the pregnancy period. And at its core, it's a true blue romance movie, with some seriousness at the side as it takes a long hard look at modern relationships, and the challenges faced by the modern family. It's expectations versus sacrifice, and Apatow really nails it all in with aplomb. The entire film is witty and so spot on, it sometimes hurts when you see things happening on screen, happen so close to home.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen stars as Ben Stone, an unemployed man living off his insurance benefits for having been hit by a truck. He spends the day idling with his geek friends, who together, are setting up an Internet website which documents the exact moments when actresses appear nude in movies. Simply put, he's your undesirable plumb nerd who girls wouldn't want to go near. But opposites attract, and in a moment of brilliance, he manages to snog Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a beautiful executive for E! Entertainment, the It-girl with a bright future ahead of her, until their unprotected tryst.<br/><br/>So it's a tussle between the two who are poles apart, to try and learn more about each other, to see if they like each other enough to want to try and do something serious about their situation. To Alison, she's keeping the baby, and to Ben, he's in for the ride, if he can prove that he's serious about it. What I liked about the movie is the subtle reminder never to judge a book by its cover, that hey, geeks (rule) are just as fun to be with, despite their encyclopedic knowledge about totally random bits of trivia, and that they don't have model good looks.<br/><br/>But more importantly, as I mentioned, it takes a good hard look at modern relationships, and contrasts this perfectly by having Alison's married sister Debbie (Leslie Mann), sharing the spotlight as well, with Paul Rudd as Pete her husband. They seem like the perfect all-American family, but if you chip deeper into the psyche, you can see that all is not so well, and that is contributing to the fear factor our new couple are trying to grapple with.<br/><br/>Like The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up has its fair share of geek jokes, tons of movie references that movie fans can cheer about, and a number of uncredited cameos who just are a hoot to watch. And Ben's posse of geek buddies just about steal almost every scene they're in, despite being a little too predictable with their weed-smoking, free-loving, frequent-cursing ways.<br/><br/>Very rarely do comedies come with a lot of heart. Knocked Up balances fun and seriousness all too well, and as a result, with its feel good ending offering plenty of hope, makes this movie one of the best this year. Highly recommended!"
"Barbouzes","Null","1","5","7 March 2018"," Was this movie made in 1875?
","My main beef with this unfunny movie is its plot: a storyline where the heroine (Heigl) chooses to marry a complete stranger- numbskull Seth Rogen- from whom she got pregnant while drunk one night out-this as she knows nothing about him except he lives and thinks like a frat boy and has no visible means of supporting himself - is hardly comedy material: it is a tragedy. Let me rephrase that plot indeed: Heigl's character chooses to marry pot-smoking infantile loser Rogen just because she is pregnant from him and -who knows!- he might turn into a prince and a fabulous father once married! Oh d'ya think, really?? And in this script, the possibility of abortion as a (more than reasonable) exit from this life-crippling bump in the road is quickly brushed under the rug as...unthinkable, for some reason! What is this: 1875? Who really thinks in 2007 that a career girl is better off marrying a feckless dope-fiend rather than having an abortion? Methinks the director/writer of this irresponsible script (targeting a young audience), is either on the payroll of a Conservative church group, or a garden variety male chauvinist cretin."

","Knocked Up is a romantic comedy drama film that stars Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, and Leslie Mann.It follows the repercussions of a drunken one-night stand between a slacker character and a just- promoted media personality that results in an unintended pregnancy.It was co-produced, written, and directed by Judd Apatow.<br/><br/>When a one-night stand that should have stayed that way has unexpected consequences, the reluctant odd couple attempts to transform their tentative relationship into a lasting love in this conception comedy. Twenty-four-year-old entertainment journalist Alison Scott (Heigl) is on the fast track to the big time, but an alcohol-fueled hookup with responsibility-shirking slacker Ben Stone (Rogen) finds her professional priorities taking a back seat to having a baby. Now, as overgrown kid Ben attempts to assume the responsibilities of fatherhood, he makes the brave decision to stand by Alison. In order to make things work between the pair, however, there's going to have to be some compromise, and when Alison and Ben decide to take a shot at love, they quickly find that building a relationship from scratch isn't nearly as easy as making a baby.<br/><br/>It is one of the best comedy I have ever seen just like The 40 Year Old Virgin,who also was directed by the film's director Judd Apatow for it was funny,goofy,smart and dirty.Aside from the laughs,it also explores the world of relationships with the next logical step -- pregnancy and how people change with this development.Also,the performances of the cast also makes the movie works as Heigl and Rogen presents character - Allison and Ben - as likable people that a viewer would really care for them with respect to what they are undergoing and what's in store for them in the future with a baby coming.This is a highly recommended film especially for people in relationship and pregnant women."

","A good critic once said that at minimum a comedy has to have 5 laughs in the whole film. I probably laughed 5 times so I guess it barely passes as a comedy, so why have I even given this as high as 6 despite a slightly contemptuous opening statement? The first reason is that I don't really feel like it was even trying to be that funny.<br/><br/>The second is that I enjoy a tale of the average Joe getting to get with an attractive successful women, and grows up in the process, makes me feel hopeful...<br/><br/>I am of course well aware of the zany housemates doing funny things is meant to be funny and at also to be a reflective visualisation of his own maturity.

I went into this film being told it's the funniest film of 2007. And I ended up seeing a drama or romance with some funny scenes thrown in, but hardly the funniest film of the year. (Those who promoted it have reneged on their claim after giving it a second viewing.) So, I was mislead... but it was still a good film.<br/><br/>I just wanted to say that -- if you came for a comedy, you might be disappointed. The scenes with Paul Rudd are pretty funny, and the running gag of making beard jokes kept me laughing, but more often than not it is two people trying to make a hopeless situation workable. And that was confusing for me -- was this a comedy or a drama? Like ""Click"", the comedy seemed overshadowed by the seriousness, but the seriousness was weakened by the comedy. maybe it was just me.<br/><br/>I still think this is a good film and worth seeing. Especially if you enjoyed ""40-Year Old Virgin"". We have Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Paul Rudd and a little bit of Steve Carrell, so it's the usual suspects here. I think I found ""40 Year"" more satisfying as a whole, but the beard parts of this one were funnier than anything in the previous film. So, they each have redeemable qualities.

But after the two so different lives of the protagonists are thrown together, the result is rather surprising and it turns out that there is a story which is truly entertaining and funny. Of course it is a movie and most probably in real life this will never happen, but we shall not always search for reality like stories. What I found very nice is the fact that we are away from the cliché of the successful man, who finds a girl who is socially not at the same level, like for example in Pretty Woman, but that this time it is a woman who plays the role of being the successful one. Very convincing and politically correct is also the situation at her workplace, were she gets her chance no matter if she is pregnant or not. She is good in her job and that is rewarded.

I mean, can you imagine that the sexy yet insanely neurotic blonde from Grey's Anatomy would make a great comedy where she gets pregnant? I expected two thirds of the film to be screams of anger and screeches of estrogen. But no! This film was so funny and smart that I thought it must be Canadian!<br/><br/>Short story long: a night stand causes the emergence of a baby. There are issues since the mother is a career woman and the father is a higher-than-life chubby bonger.<br/><br/>What I liked most of the film is that the moments of frustration are resolved in mature, intelligent ways, not by bitching and punching. Also people are not really judged. You don't get to see a lousy bum elevated to ""civilisation"" just because he gets to slave around for 10 hours a day.<br/><br/>Bottom line: great comedy. Appealing both women and males. It does touch a sensitive subject, having children (I very much prefer murder and cataclysm to it), but it is worth it for a rom com."

","First, I'll say I'm a woman.<br/><br/>Second, I'll say I loved 40YOV.<br/><br/>Third, I'll just get into it: Knocked Up's portrayal of women was reprehensible. Women do not speak that way. They do not whine. They do not get angry for no reason. They don't have sex with disgusting fat losers just because said loser may be funny at times. The absolutely do not yell at people for no reason.<br/><br/>Women, are flowers and should be treated so. Pluck them gently and they will tell you a story, or fly you a kite, they may even caress your coccyx.<br/><br/>So, you ask, why did it punch me in the pussycat? Well, I'll tell you.<br/><br/>The main reason is, I don't think that's how babies come out. That didn't seem real at all. She screamed a little then suddenly there's a slightly balding person forcing its way out of her you-know-where.<br/><br/>I don't buy it. Babies never have hair. Babies aren't all bloody. They are clean and smell like baby powder and giggle when you show them a set of keys.<br/><br/>I also really didn't like that the mom from Family Ties was in this. That didn't make any sense. She reared Alex P. Keaton, Mallory and Jennifer like over forty years ago. How could she also have made this slut who gets knocked up? Those kids didn't even look like real kids. They looked like stunt midgets.<br/><br/>The only thing I did like about this movie was Ryan Seacrest's cameo. I really believed in his character from start to finish. I once had a, shall we say, tryst with Ryan and he's exactly like that when he's naked and drunk and hopped up on Mountain Dew.<br/><br/>In conclusion I'd say this movie didn't make me want to have sex, give birth, smoke pot, watch TV, eat onions, make Tang, or even laugh.<br/><br/>That's why it punched me in the pussycat."

"Agita","7","1","5","13 June 2007"," Knocked Up knocks it out of the park.
","KNOCKED UP is the latest in a line of comedies that has surfaced in the past few years that I hope lasts a long time, films that don't treat their characters as the butt of jokes or grist for the mill, but instead the film seems to love it's characters and so...we do too. The humor comes to the audience through pure honesty - it's funny...because it's so true, which is the best place for comedy to come from. <br/><br/>When a swinging single young bachelor scores big time while out on the town, he not only spikes the ball...he plants the seed. There are so many directions one can go with a set up like this, but the idea that the couple will go through with the pregnancy...and learn to sincerely love each other, is such a breath of fresh air and optimism in a time when we so need it. <br/><br/>Seth Rogen is the heir apparent to Ben Stiller's thrown of funny regular Jewish guy, and like any good heir should, Rogen kicks things up a notch. His warmth and good humor are all so natural and work so well together that he seems to be a movie star unlike any other. Hollywood spends millions trying to hoist the next matinée idol on us, and here Rogen just sort of slips in and I have to tell you - hand him the trophy, because he's the real deal.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl too is nothing short of breathtaking...not only is she easy on the eyes, and a wonderful actress, but she's gifted with the comedy too. <br/><br/>The truth is that the film is so breezy and charming that you can't help but to be pulling for it. Judd Apatow is a gifted writer and director, with not only an ear for what's funny, but the balls to put it out there and trust the audience won't pass a negative judgment on the characters. Lines like: ""Don't let the door hit your pu**y on the way out."" I mean...ya gotta love it. He also made The 40 year Old Virgin, if you haven't seen that already - rent it. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Jonah Hill, and the rest of the cast seem to be having so much fun here it's infectious. Can you tell I liked the film? I will say there were parts of it that really reminded me of an old indie film called COURTING COURTNEY that I picked up ages ago, it's not exactly a remake...but there seemed to be slight organ transplants which were all just a loving nod to this little seen no budget indie gem.<br/><br/>Biggest laugh was Leslie Mann trying to get into a bar and being told she couldn't because she was too old. The doorman, whom I believe was played by an actor named Craig Robinson, was PITCH PERFECT with lines like: <br/><br/>""You old, she pregnant. Can't have a bunch of old pregnant bi****s running around. That's crazy, I'm only allowed to let in five percent black people. He said that, that means if there's 25 people here I get to let in one and a quarter black people. So I gotta hope there's a midget in the crowd."" <br/><br/>For that kind of dialog alone...KNOCKED UP is worth the admission, and in this day and age of admission prices, that's saying something."

","So I saw ""Knocked Up"" this weekend and I loved it and everyone should see it. I haven't seen a movie that had me laughing all the way through in a while. The writer/director also wrote ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and if you thought Seth Rogen's character helped make that movie you will LOVE this one...SO GO SEE IT, I'm going again tonight...be prepared for lots of the use of the f word (made 109 on the list of movies that use a lot of the f word) and lots of awkward graphic sex scenes and the gross crowning of a head during labor. but all of that just made the movie more realistic...which is something that writer does really well - make realistic scenes and dialogue and characters...OK, just go see it!"

","Judd Apatow brings another classic comedy home with 'Knocked Up'. I saw a screening of this film last night and can't stop thinking about all the hilarious scenes. It is an unforgettable movie that really makes you laugh endlessly. There was only a few minutes in the entire film where the audience was not laughing hysterically.<br/><br/>The characters are relatable and you find yourself caring for all of the problems that Ben (Rogen) encounters. All of the roommates really add to the movie and are un-forgettable.<br/><br/>This movie is the funniest film in years, if not ever!

","This movie was very good. I have to say it is my favorite for 2007. So far all the movies I've seen for this year where good/OK. But this one was great. Great comedy, good acting, and you can understand what is going on and how everyone relates to each other and what not. If you want to see this movie but haven't yet I suggest you do. The only thing I have to say is that if you are easily offended, don't see the movie. But if you like jokes, and not much bothers you, see it. It was a great movie and a excellent comedy. I saw it yesterday with a group of friends and we all agree it was a good movie. Great choice. And for me the jokes didn't get old. It wasn't a comedy ware two things are funny and the rest was dull. No that it wasn't. It was funny for most of it. Go, Go, Go, Go see it."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","5","10 June 2007"," Knocked Up is Knock Out
","In an unexpectedly introspective scene in ""Knocked Up"", Pete (Paul Rudd) with Ben (Seth Rogen) watch Pete's daughters play with soap bubbles. Pete says,"" They (the girls) remind you that you will never be that happy again."" Later in a heartbreaking moment Pete's wife Debbie (Leslie Mann) cries to Pete, ""That is so mean! "" Not to give anything way, it is not an indiscretion, but to Debbie it may as well have been a crippling betrayal. Even with the hysterical sexual humor and clever four letter rifts, ""Knocked Up"" has the striking background story of a marriage enduring and working out. Writer and Director Judd Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" is raucous and smart R-rated fun that is amazingly sweet and sentimental. ""Knocked Up"" is refreshingly entertaining, and a great movie. I guess this is not very surprising coming from Apatow, who also did ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"".<br/><br/>A week ago I read a curious review by Carina Chocano of the L.A. Times. She contended that a failing of ""Knocked Up"" is that we never get to ""wonder if maybe she (Katherine Heigl's Alison) might have done a little better."" She makes a valid point. Katherine Heigl's Alison is drop dead gorgeous, smart, has a career, and she ends up having a costly one night stand with Seth Rogen's Ben. Charming as Rogen is, he is no Brad Pitteven if you are stone cold drunk. More on that later. Though a valid observation, ""Knocked Up"" is merely a movie, and a comedy at that. Whether a slacker, apparent loser guy with a big heart would really end up with the smart and stunningly gorgeous woman like Alison would really happen, seems beside the point. After all, this is a movie. So Seth Rogen plays Ben, a smart, funny slacker dude, who along with his roommates is starting up a ""skin"" website on the Internet. Yes, theirs is a noble ambition. Ben is basically an over grown adolescent living with a bunch of well intentioned, but lovable losers. On the other hand, Alison (Heigl) works as a production assistant for the ""E!"" channel. She lives with her sister Debbie (Mann), husband Pete (Rudd), and their two daughters to save money. Alison lives in the guest-house and helps out with the kids when she can. Alison is brilliant and ambitious career woman. The producers at ""E!"" promote Alison to on-camera interviewer. To celebrate Alison and Debbie have girls' night at a club. There Debbie meets Ben and his crew. Ben recovers from an out of body charming moment with Alison. When Debbie is called away on family emergency, Alison chooses to stay with Ben. They proceed to get drunk, but also seem to have a natural chemistry. Ben ends up back at Alison's guest-house. Ben even says to Alison, ""You are a lot prettier than I am"" However, before the throes of passion, Ben does not 'snap on' his protection. Consequently, 8 weeks later Alison is pregnant. So aside from learning to be parents, Ben and Alison must get to know each other, as well as something about themselves.<br/><br/>Here Apatow brilliantly contexts Debbie (Mann) and Pete's (Rudd) marriage. There is a lot of broadly leveled marital humor throughout, but the performances by Mann and Rudd are amazing and anchor the movie. Debbie lends insight on marriage and parenthood to Alison. Pete does the same with Ben. Debbie authentically anguishes over fears of being too old to be hot, as she comically lashes out at a night club doorman. When she feels betrayed by Pete, that is heart retching. Rudd is hilarious as he parties in Las Vegas with Ben. And he displays touching humility when Ben points out to him that Debbie loves him so much that she wants to spend all her time with him. ""Knocked Up"" is amazing in that it is completely funny throughout in poking fun at the stupid and selfish things we do. However, it also balances this with an appreciation for what is best and noble in people. Seth Rogen is completely charming and hilarious. He inhabits Ben with a gentle and caring soul. You clearly root for slacker Ben, to grow up and be the man he so avoids being. Katherine Heigl (""Grey's Anatomy) is going to be a big star. Stunningly beautiful she is so bold and vulnerable in playing Alison, the together gal suddenly facing single parenthood and raging hormones. There is a hysterical rant where she screams to Ben, ""My vagina will never be the same"" This serves as a reminder; ""Knocked Up"" is not for kids. However, for adults ""Knocked Up"" is hysterical comedy that is surprisingly sweet and poignant. Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" is awesome."
"desirea_keeler","10","1","5","9 June 2007"," Best movie in a LONG time!!!
","Oh my god! This was by far the funniest movie I have seen in a very, very long time. It kept you laughing from the very beginning to the very end. Everyone in the theaters was busting up with laughter, The acting was awesome and the jokes were not forced! It wasn't actors doing forced stupid comedy in order to get a few cheap laughs from the audience. It was also very real...in that everything that occurred could definitely happen in ""real life"" and not just ""movie life"". This is the first movie in a VERY long time that is worth the $10 ticket price. Very much looking forward to the DVD release so that I can watch it over and over!"

","Based on the ratings, I thought I'd find this movie hilarious. My husband and I went hoping for the best and were sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie had maybe 5 funny parts. I guess if you enjoy watching people 1)smoke pot (with all kinds of instruments), 2)watch movies with nudity, 3)simulate sex fully clothed and 4)fake laughter you will love this movie.<br/><br/>My husband & I both thought it dragged, was mostly stupid and implausible. For example, a character supposedly has -0- recollection of the night before but then recounts something specific that happened later in the movie. The main woman character has this successful career but ends up helping her clueless boyfriend keep track of the nudity in movies. Silly, stupid.<br/><br/>The acting was decent except for the main guy character - I hate his laugh and it's constant throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The only redeeming scene for me was the birth which was moving. Other than that, this was a waste of 2 hours."
"mrband99","10","1","5","8 June 2007"," Just as good as 40 Yr Old Virgin
","Remember the movie ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""? Well, they've remade it and called it Knocked Up. Well, not completely - there's a totally new story. But the same writer, director, and half the cast are back (no Steve Carrell, alas). And this movie has everything that the other one had: outrageously raunchy comedy, guys being disgusting, and truly touching moments. This is a very good thing.<br/><br/>I loved the 40 Year Old Virgin; it's one of my favorite movies. I did not think Judd Apatow could strike gold twice, but he has. Knocked Up once again delivers on every level. If anything, the plot and sensitive moments have even gotten stronger. The comedy certainly hasn't let up - I haven't laughed that hard in quite a while. In fact, I missed a lot of the dialogue because everyone was laughing so hard for so long.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl (Gray's Anatomy) stars as Alison, a very pretty girl with a successful TV job at the E! channel. Seth Rogen plays Ben, reprising his likable lug character from 40 yr old, and if anything he's a little more of a slob and loser. But he's still very witty and honest, which is what makes his character so likable. The two meet up at a bar where they are both drunk, and they end up having a one night stand. Of course, she ends up pregnant, and decides to keep the baby just to spite her mom. So they try to make a relationship work together.<br/><br/>Now, from here the movie could get very predictable, but it doesn't. Sure, we know where it's eventually headed, but it sure doesn't get there the normal way. The two would-be parents fight almost nonstop, as their personalities are very different. But there's a realism to their fights that hits home. The audience is left thinking, ""this sounds like two actual people arguing, not a scripted fight."" Their frustrations come out, and the typical differences between men and women's thoughts are showcased. Just when their fights are getting really bitter, just when we've had enough, just when it seems to be heading in the direction of ""The Break Up"" (a supposed comedy that was just really uncomfortable and bitter fighting), the mood is broken up by more outstanding comedy.<br/><br/>One sidestory involves Alison's sister and brother-in-law. Paul Rudd from 40 Yr Old plays the husband, and he and Ben instantly bond over their manly feelings. The wife is played by the actress who was the drunk that puked on Steve Carrell in 40 Yr Old. She plays a very angry, controlling, and insecure lady who ends up alienating her husband with her attitude. It is interesting to watch Alison and Ben spend time with the other family, who have 2 kids of their own already. Every little problem or argument that the family has is painfully apparent to the new couple, and they fear that their own relationship will be headed in this direction.<br/><br/>There are many great scenes in this movie that really help it relate to the audience. In one scene, a major earthquake strikes in the middle of the night. In the aftermath, Alison realizes that when it was an emergency, Ben was not there to help her. Can she really rely on him, or is he doomed to be a slacker forever? Upon sifting through their scattered things, she realizes some other truths about him. In another couple scenes, Ben is having a conversation with his dad (the great Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame), asking for advice. His dad is kind and honest, and says nice things that any dad would, but he does not and cannot seem to really give his son any advice. It becomes clear that his dad really is just an older and more mature version of himself: he's a likable guy and has good intentions, but isn't necessarily wise and doesn't really know what to do either.<br/><br/>If you took out all the over-the-top jokes and raunch in this film, it would stand alone quite well as its own sweet romantic comedy. But of course the jokes are awesome, and fans of Farrelly Brothers-type humor will not be disappointed. This movie has something for everyone, and unless you're easily offended by a dirty joke, should have most people rolling in the aisles. This is exactly the kind of movie I love, and I highly recommend it. If there's anything wrong with it, I didn't notice."

And I was not disappointed at all, I went with my best bud and I'm pretty sure we laughed the whole time, the joke style in this movie is similar to 40 Year Old Virgin and it's nothing less of comedic genius.<br/><br/>All in all, not much to say about this movie besides the fact that you NEED to see this movie, and if you leave the theater disappointed, well, I don't know what the hell is wrong with you. This movie is definitely the hit of the summer and I'm definitely going to see this movie again and I'm waiting for the DVD because I'm buying it the day it comes out!!!

"iKramerica-1","7","1","5","6 June 2007"," Good, somewhat crude, but doesn't try to be something else...
","People who expect this to be a romantic comedy are missing the point I think. It's NOT about romance. It's about a drunken fling that ends in pregnancy, and examining what a woman who won't consider abortion an option is going to do about it. She has to try and see if this man she slept with is worth anything, since it will be her baby's father. Who knows, she might discover he's worth keeping around all the time? Is there going to be romance? Who knows. Maybe, maybe not. Will they try to force the issue like so many other people do, or let themselves get time to know each other, even though they skipped a few steps by screwing on the first date and making a baby.<br/><br/>Obviously she's better than he is. Obviously his life sucks and her's is going to be changed forever by the pregnancy. And he has to learn that, and make himself a better person. There, it's a bit formulaic. But there is a lot of truth to the situation, despite the silliness of the humor.<br/><br/>I really could have done without the whole ""I work in Hollywood"" angle of the film. That's so boring to people who don't work there, and boring to those who do as well. Does Ryan Seacrest need to be in a movie? Really? Or does Andy Dick need any more validation for his screwed up life?<br/><br/>That part really took me out of the story, but other than that, it was the ""stoners"" perspective on love, life and growing up, and not being a stoner, it seemed real to me. And I'm sure for the stoners out there, the colors were pretty enough to keep them occupied... ;)"

As it was, when I saw it there were people aged 60-80 in the theater and it was very awkward. But the whole theater was laughing throughout the entire movie. I was expecting an amateur teen movie but it really wasn't. And another thing I liked was that the funny lines you saw in the trailer weren't the only funny lines. It's so rare now a days.

"worldofjohnboy","6","1","5","4 June 2007"," Outstanding Dramity
","I had read most of the reviews of ""hatred"" for this film before seeing it opening night. Not one of the people whom disliked the film seemed to give it a bad film because of the plot, poor acting, bad jokes, etc. The only flaw people seemed to bring up was that there was no way that the main characters would ever get together in real life. This ""criticism"" not only didn't hold water to me (I have bore witness to many a one-night-stands of odd proportions in my lifetime), but I found it to be a very small critique of what appeared to be a much better film than that.<br/><br/>After watching the film, I have to say that this not only had me laughing me almost out of my seat at times, but also had me really knotted up into the love story and coming of age of the characters. Judd Apatow has the Midas touch when it comes to appealing to both the childish man comedy and the classic chick-flick flare. My wife even commented that Seth Rogen even had her pulling for him and that he has a really sneaky attractiveness to him in this movie. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd both completely lived up to the billing and improved an already talented cast. This movie was well worth every penny I spent at the theater and then some. I may go see it again just to make sure that I catch all the ""other"" things that I know I missed the first time."

","""Knocked Up"" / 2006 / Released: June 1, 2007 / Viewed: June 3, 2007 / Comedy<br/><br/>***.5 (Very Good)<br/><br/>Written and Directed by: Jude Apatow / Running time: 129 minutes<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" is a surprisingly well written, acted and directed film from Jude Apatow ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", 2005. I have not seen ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", nor any other films from this director-writer. I was impressed by the honesty, humor and sweetness of the film. This film has a title I took a quick liking to. The title promised an honest film, and the film delivers in that respect among others. <br/><br/>A young, attractive and ambitious female E! television host meets a young lazy, immature and unambitious young man at a bar while she is celebrating a promotion at work. They drink together and quickly become friendly. This leads to an unexpected sexual encounter. The problem is, that 8 weeks later, she learns she is pregnant from their one night stand sex encounter.<br/><br/>Director-writer Jude Apatow shows a lot of insight into anxieties about relationships and pregnancy. With an unusually long running time for a comedy (2 hours and 9 minutes), this film takes time to really develop it's two main characters and follow their story over the next 7 months with humor, honesty and sensitivity. Considering the long running time, and this is a comedy film, the film never feels stretched out or too long. With a cast of largely unknown actors and the insightful screenplay, the main and supporting characters come across as convincingly real and ordinary.<br/><br/>The few weaknesses are some occasional moments of humor and character types typically found in crude adolescent comedy films. What really makes this film a winner is it's screenplay, directing and acting, in that order. The film initially appears to be a man's film, however it spends a generous amount of time with some strong female characters, that convincingly speak with honesty and sensitivity.<br/><br/>Director-writer Apatow is a former television comedy writer. With this film, he shows he is very keen on finding and exploring the anxieties, humor and warm feelings found in romantic relationships. And he is being honest and straightforward with his characters and how they express themselves. The story involves some male and female bonding, to help cope with and make it through difficult personal situations. The lead man and woman each pair off with a same sex friend, bond and travel off to have some fun together. It's here that they really learn about themselves and realize they need to return home and bravely face their difficult and awkward personal circumstances in life.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the better written, directed and acted comedies of recent years!"
"bobzby","10","1","5","2 June 2007"," Laughing Riot
","Running Riot. That's the term in Unreal Tournament used to describe when a player is on a roll and killing everything in sight. If I had to describe Knocked Up in one phrase, it'd be Running Riot.<br/><br/>Knocked Up is a nonstop rampage. It's such a barrage of laughter that at times you might forget that the scene is suppose to be serious.<br/><br/>The movie has its share of crude moments, which will definitely define the movie for some people. For example, it's cruder than Judd Apatow's last film, 40 Year Old Virgin. Personally I'm a fan of such humor, but I know there will be some shocked moviegoers because the trailers don't prepare you. If you aren't a fan of the crude, don't be deterred by those who will pen this as just a series of sex jokes. It's more than that and you won't be sorry for taking my advice.<br/><br/>I don't exaggerate when I say I couldn't stop laughing for the majority of the movie. Serious moments almost became like timeouts where I could dry my eyes from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>The cast is almost like an ensemble cast with the focus being on Rogan and Heigl. The supporting cast features a vast array of memorable characters similar to the formula in The Office. Speaking of The Office and SNL fans: expect to see many familiar faces.<br/><br/>I think the average viewer may not laugh as much as I did. Admittedly I'm an easy laugher but at the same times I think there were a lot of pop culture jokes in Knocked Up and some people just didn't get them. There was a hilarious scene involving fantasy baseball that absolutely no one in theater except myself laughed at. Then there was a genius joke about Everybody Loves Raymond that again no one laughed at except a few people.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed 40 Year Old Virgin, there's no doubt you'll die laughing in this movie. If you are really offended by sex and toilet jokes, I feel sorry for you because you'll be missing out on an excellent movie that offers much more than those forms of humor. Or at least I think it did. I was too drunk on laughter.<br/><br/>Just go watch it. Get Knocked Up."
"Buddy-51","8","1","5","2 June 2007"," perceptive romantic comedy
","Like many romantic comedies these days, ""Knocked Up"" can seem a bit schizophrenic at times, straddling a fine line between salty language, sexual innuendo and crude sight gags on the one hand, and a foursquare endorsement of monogamy and marriage on the other. The standard formula for such films is that the characters are allowed to be as promiscuous as they want to be in the early stages of the drama provided they see the error of their ways and settle into responsible domestic conformity by the time the closing credits come rolling by.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" goes a step further than most films in this genre by turning this theme - which is usually more implied than stated - into the very cornerstone of the movie itself. Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is a socially backward, unemployed, loser stoner who has a drunken one-night-stand with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a beautiful, up-and-coming reporter for the E Channel. When, in the stone-cold sober light of early morning, Alison sees who exactly it was she had sex with the night before, she essentially brushes Ben off, never expecting to really have to deal with him ever again. Fate, however, has other plans, as she soon discovers that she is pregnant with Ben's baby. Will Ben do the right thing by giving up his nerdish bachelor ways to marry Alison and be a true father to his child? Will Alison overcome her initial repulsion to discover the true Ben and start a family with him? Even though the answers to those questions are never much in doubt given the nature of the genre, the movie has a great deal of fun getting to those answers..<br/><br/>This is writer/director Judd Apatow's highly anticipated follow-up to the wildly popular ""The 40 Year Old Virgin,"" a film that most people seemed to enjoy more than I did. For despite some fine performances and some very funny moments, ""Virgin"" often seemed weighed down by both the implausibility of its premise and its dogmatic adherence to the overused ""Pygmalion"" formula. Luckily, ""Knocked Up"" starts right off the bat with a more believable and compelling premise, which allows the audience to more clearly identify with the characters and their situations. What separates ""Knocked Up"" from so many other generic romantic comedies is that Apatow has a sharp ear for the way people in the real world actually speak. The lines are not only incisive, witty and sophisticated, but they are also what we would expect to hear coming out of the mouths of individuals caught in their particular situations. He makes us laugh at all the foolishness, foibles and insecurities we ourselves are prone to as we cope with the often maddening complexities of human relationships. Apatow also has a rare gift for making even the secondary characters compelling and interesting. Thus, even though Ben and Alison are the primary focus of the movie, Alison's uptight sister, Debbie, and her beaten-down husband, Pete, are fully fleshed-out figures as well. And even though Ben's loser roommates come across as fairly stereotypical zonked-out geeks and nerds, at least they are given some very funny one-liners to deliver as commentary on the main action.<br/><br/>However, all is not mere fun-and-games in this film. Some of the fight scenes, for instance, are surprisingly raw and cutting in their no-holds-barred brutality and frankness, and many in the audience may find themselves squirming uncomfortably in recognition of things that they themselves have said or done in the heat of anger. On a more upbeat note, Apatow also has a knack for inserting up-to-the-minute pop culture and movie references into the dialogue without making it feel desperate or forced. This gives the movie an enjoyably contemporary, ""with-it"" quality - although one wonders how far that may go towards limiting the shelf life of the movie in the long run, and how dated it may appear to audiences catching it on some cable station a decade or two from now.<br/><br/>Apatow is also to be commended for building his romantic comedy around a less-than-hunky male lead (although he doesn't have the nerve to go for a Plain Jane equivalent for the distaff side of the equation). It also helps that Rogen and Heigl are so utterly endearing in the roles of Ben and Alison, and that they receive such fine support from the likes of Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and many others, including a handful of recognizable celebrities who make cameo appearances playing themselves.<br/><br/>It's true that the movie runs out of steam a bit along the way and overstays its welcome by about a half hour or so, but given its broad canvas, ""Knocked Up"" feels more expansive, comprehensive and fully baked than your average cookie-cutter romantic comedy. It's also a great deal more fun."
"elem_hunter","5","1","6","13 October 2007"," Decent, but not that great
","I am surprised to see that people ""laughed so hard"" at this movie and consider it way better than ""40 years old virgin"". From my point of view, this is not even close as good as that one. Basically you are dealing with a classical romance comedy, with an original plot, but it's not that funny, really. Don't expect a lot of laughs from this one, unless you are one of those who get easily amused. The movie is not bad and it can be an ideal weekend movie or leisure time movie. You know, just hanging there, with your wife/girlfriend or by yourself and watching it. But, as I was saying, don't expect to watch a comedy better than ""40 years old virgin""."

","Having been a fan of Judd Apatow since ""Freaks and Geeks"", I wanted to see Knocked Up since I saw the preview a few weeks ago. Boy, am I glad I did! Seth Rogen, one of Apatow's stock actors from nearly all his projects, does nicely in the leading role of a slacker who meets a beautiful woman (Katherine Heigl) at a dance club one night which leads to a one-night-stand which leads to...Anyway, most of the familiar cast from ""F & G"" and ""Undeclared"" lend fine support here along with Harold Ramis as Rogen's dad, Joanna Kerns as Heigl's mom, and Leslie Mann (Apatow's wife) as Heigl's sister. There's also a hilarious cameo of the host of the Most Popular Television Show Right Now. I think you know what I'm talking about. And for SNL fans, there's Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig. There may be some uncomfortable scenes in between but that just makes this more satisfying when the happy ending inevitably occurs. In fact, I'd say Knocked Up is one of the few adult comedies out that is worth seeing right now. So what are you waiting for? Just watch!"
"VoodooChicken","5","1","7","2 July 2007"," Very blah
","This movie pulls in too many directions and tries to say too many things, I'm not sure what exactly Judd Apatow was trying to say. Most of the jokes were good for a light chuckle, but I don't think they got any guffaws from me. Leslie Mann was great, as was Katherine Heigel. The main problem was I just didn't care much for any of the characters. It was also distracting the sheer number of current and former Apatow/NBCUniversal performers they crammed into this (40-Year-Old Virgin, Freaks & Geeks, SNL, the Office, etc.). I love, LOVE Kristen Wiig ever since her Joe Schmo days, but I just wasn't feeling it with her role. I really didn't need to see Seth Rogen's butt, or Jason Segel's butt. At least 30 minutes needed to be cut from the final product. Just go watch There's Something About Mary for the umpteenth time instead."

It approaches the subject well, and Aptow does a great job keeping it fresh and never boring. (He gets in one shot I was horrified at twice!) See it, bring a date, you'll love it. So I liked the movie is the basic theme I'm trying to get out here. OK...I've said everything I needed to say here. I'm only typing because I needed 10 lines of text. Does anyone have any questions?

I applaud the writer, director, and cast for not trying too hard. Should they attempt to follow up this movie (if anyone recalls the tragedy of the American Pie series, please take note) I can only hope that it will be with a similar balance of maturity and HILARIOUS cussing Ryan Seacrest filled scenes that would entail raising a daughter around a bunch of potheads.<br/><br/>And thank GOD that t*** Lindsay Lohan was not chosen for the lead role."

","I like my fair share of comedies like Wedding Crashers, 40-Year-Old Virgin, Zoolander, etc. What defines a movie to be funny for me is that no matter how many times you see a movie, it remains funny. This is also why I despise Will Ferrel. This movie does have a lot of low brow humor and jokes that rely on cursing or drug use, but it also has that genius touch that only Judd Apatow can deliver. If Seth Rogen doesn't become a huge star after all is said and done, then I will have lost all hope for Hollywood. Most comedies are defined by one scene, or a couple of lines; but not this one. The movie is thoroughly funny from beginning to end. This movie was by far the funniest movie I have seen in a long time; if not ever."

Filmmaker Judd Apatow mixes the right amount of hilarity with heart, sweetness with raunch  a formula he perfected with '05's smash hit comic blockbuster THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN  and proves to be the smart, go-to-guy for high-concept comedies in Hollywood. Kudos to the fine supporting ensemble including the always dependable, adroit comic genius of Rudd and Mann  real-life Mrs. Apatow  also brilliant as Heigl's brother-in-law and older sister who serve as the template for her situation and the Greek chorus quartet of Rogen's roomie buds Segel, Baruchel, Hill and Starr providing so many off-shooting one-liner guffaws, repeated viewings are a must.

","It doesn't sound too promising. Seth Rogen picks up Katherine Heigl in a dance hall, both of them drunk. A night of passion and she turns up preggers. Abortion being out of the question (this is a romantic comedy) the two of them must struggle through he condition for the following nine months. The pregnancy threatens her job at a TV studio and his way of life as a profound wastrel. It not only sound unpromising, it sounds familiar. Two mismatched people fall in love, give up their selfish ways, and have a cute baby.<br/><br/>Yet the edgy comedy is deftly handled by the director and the performers, even down to supporting roles. It doesn't get truly sickening until the last five minutes or so -- after the excruciating birth scene -- and during the credits, at which time we see home movies and still photos of all those cute cooing tykes that we'd so far been spared.<br/><br/>It's raunchy as hell with F bombs galore and some of the funniest scenes depend on that vulgarity but it's not adolescent. It's fully blown and mature.<br/><br/>As much impressive as anything else is the picture it presents of life in Northridge, California. Oh, how the mores have changed since I was their age. The talk among men in my youth was always industrial strength -- but WOMEN or ""girls"" didn't use it, nor did young men use it when women were present. And even without women around, the curses were colorful but decorative. The swearing in this film is equal to that I'd only found in the military, mere punctuation with no semantic baggage. And the women use equally foul language. There's dope all over the place. And everybody hops right into the sack with whoever they pick up at a bar! Where was this life style when I NEEDED it? Oh, I'm -- I'm choking up. (Sob.) Seth Rogen is nobody's idea of a handsome man. At least I don't think so. He's chubby, has a halo of curly locks, needs a shave, and has a voice that suggests gargling. But he's a good actor and brings exactly the right characteristics to the role.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away the jokes but I guess I can mention two, both involving small parts.<br/><br/>(1) A desperately worried Rogen consults his Dad, the late Harold Ramis, and asks his advice. The advice? Stop worrying. Marriage is a wonderful state and children are a living miracle. Later, when Rogen's life is going to hell in a hand basket, he calls Ramis and shouts that the advice was all wrong. Reply: ""I've been divorced three times -- how could you have listened to somebody like me?"" (2) The pregnant Heigl consults a Chinese obstetrician who quizzes her about bad habits the way an aggressive district attorney attacks a defendant. ""And how many cigarettes have you smoked? Hmm? How MANY?"" You'll probably get a lift out of it. It's a knowing sort of comedy built around bits of reality that everyone will find recognizable."

","Very typical current day romantic comedy ; unattractive, unworthy fat guy knocks up fairly cute (at least for him) out of his league , together gal, with predictable results. <br/><br/>Since Hollywood doesn't give us suspense anymore, we all know how this will unfold. The ""better than thou"" girl at first doesn't like the guy, then his goofy antics and persistence eventually win her over. It has not changed for 50 years, except in the old days they would not have had sex until after they committed, where as today they have sex first, then figure it out later.<br/><br/>I am not passing judgment on the hook up culture of today. I am passing judgment about every film being always the same. Apatow is no different- the male character is ugly, dumb, incompetent and needy, the woman is attractive, smart , independent and gets to make all the choices. Too bad in the real world even the fat guys are unavailable, since they just stay the the basement playing video games. Probably seen guys portrayal in films like this played a role.<br/><br/>Some of the messages the movie sends could be negative for young people. Not the ""knocked up"" part , that is nothing new, but they portray the doctor as an annoying A-hole , even though he has brains and training beyond anybody who is in or made the film. No wonder the guy in it who plays the doctor (yes he is a real one) left being a real doctor (I'm not kidding) for a film career. Hey Judd-OB-GYNs work an average 90 hours per week, you wanna deliver your own kids? Show some respect.<br/><br/>The acting is good , and some of the players like Hill are very talented comics. But I am worried about what a childhood and adolescence of seeing these films will do to a male. They always see themselves as negative, and if they have a male friend, they suffocate in self conscious ""does this look gay, does that seem gay"" gags. Makes you wonder what some of these filmmakers childhoods were like; Did they see any competent, worthy men?"

","Knocked Up is a straight-out comedy with a hilarious screenplay that is filled with cultural references. The premise of the story is that two people hook up one night and it leads to an unwanted pregnancy. Due to the unwillingness of the mother to part with her baby, the two of them decide to give a shot at having an actual relationship which is what we see in the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Ben (Seth Rogen) is a slacker with no job who hangs around with a bunch of like-minded friends whose only ambition in life is to get high. Alison (Katherine Heigl) is the complete opposite of Ben with a settled life as an entertainment news reporter. Even though both of them cannot have more distinct personalities, they somehow manage to make things work.<br/><br/>There is a wonderful support cast featuring Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and Jason Segel. All of the characters are well developed with Paul Rudd being exceptionally good. <br/><br/>The minor hiccup in the movie is the development of Alison who is a contradiction. The story does take a lot of liberties when characters make some terrible judgments. However, as this is a comedy movie, we can cut the filmmakers some slack.<br/><br/>Knocked Up manages to deal with the subject amiably without getting too preachy.

(Also I'm majoring in filmmaking, so am very into the art of it.) If you are the church-going, one track mind type, and you live your life being offended by every sex reference you hear, this is not the movie for you. I was raised in a very intelligent, loving family of doctors and credential college and high school teachers. I have been taught, PEACE, love, and human nature by some very smart people that I guarantee you are far from anything close to the devil. Being written by Utah Entertainment, I'm sure many Mormons have seen this movie and are the ones giving it bad reviews, because of it's raunchiness. DO NOT GET THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT THESE LOW REVIEWS, unless of course you are one of those people. If you understand why South Park is so genius, as my family does, you will love this movie. (I do happen to also know some people who don't care for South Park who loved this film.) I would say this film would be loved by ages 15-75 (yes my Grandma liked this movie, a lot.) You would pretty much have to be someone who is totally freaked out about the world and think you were going to hell if you like a movie with premarital sex, drugs, and vulgar language in order to be turned off by this film. I AM TELLING YOU I could list two dozen very intelligent people that loved this movie. These are people who have very good paying jobs, who are happy, peaceful, and high on life; not burnouts or delinquent teenagers. The people who do not understand this film are strictly those who are afraid of the world, which I'm sure you've come across plenty of them. They are the types of people who are 'happy' but when you get to know them, they're not really happy, they're terrified. This is a very well written, intelligent piece of art. I promise it will bring you many laughs, and a warmed heart. This is a beautiful portrait of life, love, laughter, friendship, and everything in between. Don't even pay attention to the low ratings/reviews, watch the movie; it's very raunchy so of course there's those people who will be offended. If you are one of those people, then don't watch it. But we don't need your one star reviews just because you don't have a complete life. This movie is praised by many who understand the beauty of life in a whole."

","From the mind of Judd Apatow came Knocked Up, a formulaic romantic comedy that provides some sporadic laughs thanks to the film's unconventional leading man.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a party animal and all-around bum who meets a tightly wound television reporter for E named Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) who he meets one night in a bar. Though the meeting doesn't exactly set off fireworks, the two do go home together and have sex. Ben is thrown for a loop a couple of months later when Allison gets in touch with him to inform Ben that she is pregnant with his child.<br/><br/>The rest of this 2007 film pretty much follows the formula you would expect from such a tired plot line except for the fact that Ben Stone is completely clueless regarding pregnancy and fatherhood and all that it entails and watching Ben navigate these very choppy waters provides the majority of the entertainment this film offers.<br/><br/>Rogen is very funny as Stone but has no chemistry with Heigl, whose character is pretty unappealing and swallowing Stone's attraction to her is a bit difficult. Apatow's nutty rep company provide solid support, especially his wife, Leslie Mann as Allison's sister, Paul Rudd as her husband, and Jason Segel, Jonah Hill, and Jay Baruchel as Ben's burn-out frineds. There is also a lovely cameo by the late Harold Ramis as Ben's father. Like most of Apatow's work, the screenplay is overly complex and the film is a little too long, but Rogen and company still manage to make it a relatively entertaining ride."

"garza-alex-611-392438","8","0","1","17 February 2013"," Sometimes Pregnancy is Funny
","""Knocked Up"" is more than just a synonym for pregnant. Judd Apatow's 2007 film, starring Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl, follows the story of how one drunken stupor can lead to a nine-month journey to parenthood. ""Knocked Up"" pushes the boundaries of what comedy is by introducing real life situations and an emotion filled story, all the while keeping the audience laughing. The film follows the plot line of Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) and Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a mismatched couple, who are together as the result of an unplanned pregnancy. The major comedy of the story comes from the acting on behalf of Seth Rogen. He plays a slightly overweight, curly-fro haired man who finds himself at a crossroads in his life. In essence, his character can best be described as a loser; he is unemployed, smokes marijuana regularly, and lives in a house full of male ""entrepreneurs."" The movie's cover features a humorous photo of Rogen, posing the rhetorical question: ""What if this guy got you pregnant?"" The character of Ben Stone makes for many comedic situations when his lifestyle clashes with that of Alison Scott's, a strait laced, professional woman working for the E television network. Primarily, Apatow's humor takes advantage of uncomfortable situations by finding the absurdity within them. For instance, Stone relies heavily on a dance move called ""rolling the dice"" while dancing for the first time with Scott at an L.A. nightclub. Apatow explores the real life situations of unplanned pregnancy and marriage through the relationships of his characters. He forces the audience to ask themselves, what would you do in that situation? In the case of Ben Stone, he commits to being a father. In turn, this leads to Apatow's further development of Ben Stone. At first glance, the audience sees a quirky but good-natured man who has little going for him. By the end of the film, the growth of Stone allows the audience to view him as a better-suited, potential father. For example, in the major climax of the movie, Heigl's character goes into labor and Stone is cool under pressure. He knows exactly how to handle the situation, because he has read the baby books the couple purchased. The originality of Apatow's work is what makes it so great. This new form of comedy is relationship driven and finds humor in the struggle of peoples' day-to-day lives. In fact, Apatow brings his own life into ""Knocked Up"" by casting his family in the film. In the movie, Apatow's wife, Leslie Mann, plays Alison Scott's sister, while his two daughters are also cast. Apatow's brand of comedy is one that has a real story behind it; unlike other comedies, it is not simply one joke after another. The story in ""Knocked Up"" is seen through the different romantic relationships in the movie. On one hand, Rogen and Heigl are just beginning a relationship that started off on a rather unexpected note. On the other hand, Paul Rudd and Mann have been married for years and are looking to rekindle the love in their relationship. The humor in ""Knocked Up"" can at times be seen as juvenile, but the movie is truly more than a raunchy comedy; it's an unorthodox love story. Along the way, the comedy exposes the humorous side of unusual situations. ""Knocked Up"" allows a person to see the absurdities in everyday life, whether it is at the hottest nightclub in L.A. or at the family breakfast table."

And you have to be crazy to be in an institution."" -- Gene Simmons.<br/><br/>One could say KNOCKED UP is writer-director Judd Apatow's baby - and as malformed as the rest of his hobgoblin brood.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen is Ben, a shiftless layabout (rooming with a menagerie of oafs: Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Martin Starr) who somehow manages to knock up porn-sexy career woman, Alison (Katherine Heigl), on a girls' night out and must then deal with the consequences.<br/><br/>And consequences there are. KNOCKED UP separates itself from the Chick Flick pack - like an embryo detaching itself from a uterine wall - by showing us what happens *after* the doughy guy gets the hot girl. Not just the Credits mundanity, discomfort, stagnation Still, Seth Rogen makes the drudgery surprisingly bearable (""Do you want to do it doggie style?"" ""You're not going to f*** me like a dog."" ""It's doggie *style.* It's just the style. We don't have to go outside or anything"").<br/><br/>KNOCKED UP is not your average ""romantic comedy"" with the mandatory maudlin marriage message. It is laser focused on the comedy - let's face it, the ""romance"" is pretty much over and done once she gets ""knocked up"" - with unexpected laughs at every turn, great galloping guffaws from stupid situations (heralding Eric Bana as the resurrector of Jewish Pride in MUNICH; The Boys pretending to blow each other while Ben is on the phone to Alison; the worried summation of Ben's dancing skills, ""He's doing the dice thing too much!""); lovably disheveled characters, snappy dialog and earthly woes (middle age, kids, sex becoming stale...).<br/><br/>And though the immaturity of Ben and his roomies is quite apparent (from their asinine, amorphous get-rich-quick scheme of launching a naked celebrity website - until they discover Mr. Skin), the movie itself becomes very responsible with its exploration of pregnancy from every angle: abortion, forced marriage, a relationship based on an accident, etc. It rationalizes too hard on why this situation cannot be resolved with a quick ""I won't say it but it rhymes with shmashmortion."" And that may be a stretch (er – pun intended?), but at least KNOCKED UP brushes aside that hideous chick flick fantasy that marriage is some sanctimonious institution that everyone should aim towards, where all happiness begins and all loneliness ends.<br/><br/>Here, it's a pretty horrible state of duplicity, with uber-ad-libber Paul Rudd sneaking out on wife Leslie Mann so much, she thinks he is cheating on her, only to find he is sneaking out to play fantasy baseball. As Bill Maher says, ""The sexiest woman in the world – somebody's sick of f***ing her!"" <br/><br/>As for how a smokin' tamale like Alison could ever fall for a jobless, unambitious slob like Ben - no matter how much they hang together for support, or how deeply he cares for her or how hard he makes her laugh over the course of their pregnancy-courtship - well, that's the real fantasy..."

But than again some audiences my find her hot, I just never really liked her screen presence in movies all that much. But she fit her role in this really well and made it work. Seth Rogen is entertaining to watch in this and isn't much of a shock that this movie was his big break. Besides the part about the characters having sex without a condom after getting drunk. The movie goes in a direction where it sort of sends a message that if you want a girl to be with you, just get her pregnant cause then the chance of her just dumping you is pretty slim. The movie has some clever dialogue and the interactions between the characters is funny and entertaining. This movie isn't super funny or anything like that and although the humor probably won't make you burst out laughing like crazy it still has what it takes to catch the audiences attention with it's character interactions even if a lot of it is them screwing around.<br/><br/>7.6/10"

","I watched this movie having heard it was one of the better comedies of the 2000s. And so it was. As a modern comedy, this film absolutely lives up to the expectations. Though Seth Rogen gets most of the laughs, I think the cast all in all did a decent job. And except for some rather slow parts, you are never bored for very long. Since this is an honest review, I have to point out that the story drags on, it is all a bit too clichéd and you sort of see what is coming. However, it has heart, funny actors and good characters and, most importantly, genuinely funny moments. It even delivers heart beating climax. It is not a very deep movie, nor is it in any way mind-blowing or shocking, but if you are looking for a couple of hours of good laughs and a warm story, I would definitely recommend it."

","I decided to see this one after seeing several films lately that referenced Knocked Up & The 40 Year Old Virgin as other films this Director/Writer has made. After watching it, this is a good movie as it actually is funny & an even handed treatment of what can happen in real life.<br/><br/>Katherine Hiegl is very attractive & quite believable as the TV reporter who gets a promotion at works, goes out to celebrate, gets drunk, then has sex with Ben Stone (Seth Rogan), and then winds up pregnant after the one night stand. While Seth Rogan kind of holds this one together, Heigl, Leslie Mann (Debbie) & Paul Rudd (Pete), Alisons sister & her husband make major contributions to the film as well.<br/><br/>This is not only comedy, but for once it has the consequences. It doesn't mean too, but it does try to teach responsibility though the ending is really left open as far as will Ben & Alison actually wind up together or not. They do make it through the child birth together.<br/><br/>The humor in the movie does not seemed forced. There is even a section where Alison acts a lot like her sister, Debbie, though they are drawn as different sisters."

","I must admit, the premise of the movie was one thing that kept me away from watching this film. The idea of a one-night stand, and dealing with a pregnancy didn't seem to me good comedy, especially romantic comedy material. But I was wrong. The film is hilarious.. All the characters are likable, in their own way, smart, in their own way, funny, in their own way. Although I'm a guy, Heigl's character is probably the one I most identify with. The normal person in the land of misfits. The story is predictable,... they fall in love and raise a baby together...but surprisingly, the character development is strong between the four major characters, the minor characters are have some dimension to them. And there are some really funny moments... one of the funniest is the scene where Alison (very pregnant) and her sister try to get into the club and the doorman won't let them in...the speech the doorman gives to Alison as he pulls her aside is both touching and downright hilarious. It had me pushing the rewind button a few times."

","It's true, I said it. I think this movie is a fine piece of work and should (and probably will) go down as one of the best and funniest movies of the decade (if not our generation).<br/><br/>What makes this movie work so well is the writing and characters. You have Ben Stone, who is played wonderfully by Seth Rogen, who sits on his ass all day smoking weed and designing a website that shows you what time in a movie the female star shows some boobage. You also have Allison (Katherine Heigl) who is a successful 20 something that is more mature than Ben and just wants to try to make the relationship work out for the both of them and for the baby. Debbie and Pete (Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd, respectively) make up the ""main"" supporting cast. Debbie is Allison's sister who is a real bitch and who can't stand Allison to be with Ben. Pete is Debbie's husband, and he quickly forms a bond with Ben and they come to relate to each others' difficulties in kids and marriage. Every character is developed well, and most of them come out of this experience a new person.<br/><br/>It is Ben's duty to mature throughout the film, and that is exactly what he does. It is great to see Ben become more adult as the film goes on, and for Allison to learn to appreciate him for what he is. It's a true and down to earth movie that doesn't give up on the laughs, either.<br/><br/>The movie is quite crude and inappropriate, but by the end of the movie, some of the women in the crowd might have tears in their eyes and the film becomes more heartfelt. The genius of the movie is how Apatow can make you laugh so hard in one scene, but also have genuine feelings in the characters.<br/><br/>It is Apatow's more mature work, because the film deals with the realities of marriage and friendships, and it plays it realistically. People change and grow, and in the film, the characters have real problems. That's what makes it so good. It is a hilarious and crude comedy, but underneath the characters have problems and it deals with real world difficulties.<br/><br/>Unlike Virgin and Funny People, I didn't find the movie too long at all. Every scene was nicely timed, and I felt every scene deserved its place in the movie. The direction is great, as it is paced nicely and Apatow gives his performers enough room to go about their thing. He lets them party, but when he needs to them to act, he is able to get it out of them in a believable way.<br/><br/>Knocked Up, which I think deep down is Apatow's most mature work, is also his best."
"bobsgrock","8","0","2","5 August 2009"," An interesting blend of comedy and sincerity.
","It has been about four years since Judd Apatow burst onto the mainstream scene as a comedic director with funnier and more touching things to say than practically anyone else out there. He made his mark with The 40-Year Old Virgin, but this is a more ambitious and sensitive film that is really unlike any other comedy. Apatow's discovery, Seth Rogen, is given free reign here to show off all his comedic chops as Ben Stone, a lazy slacker whose life consists of partying with his roommates and working on a nude alert website for movies. Katherine Heigel, in her break-out role, is very sweet and likable as Allison, a career girl focused on going nowhere but to the top.<br/><br/>However, despite all that these two don't have in common, Apatow focuses more on what they do, and here they meet up at a club and realize that they both love to have a good time which is not limited to a one-night stand. Still, eight weeks later, Ben is shocked to hear from Allison and even more so when she tells him that she is pregnant and he is the father. From here on in, this is no longer you're typical comedy. Every scene with a funny line or situation is leveled with dialog that is serious and smart in nature. Watching this, it can be hard to understand why these people make some of the choices they do, but then you realize they are just like you.<br/><br/>This is not as funny as The 40-Year Old Virgin, which itself was more straightforward in its crude and tasteless comedy. Here, Apatow shows his growth as a writer and director. He still has the ability to cast flawlessly with Heigel perfect as Allison, Paul Rudd sensational as Pete and his own wife, Leslie Mann, as Pete's wife Debbie. The real surprise, though, is Seth Rogen. He has such great timing, but his acting chops come alive here and he is given the ability to show that he is not just an actor for comedy but that he can take on any role and put his personal twist on it. I watched this in preparation for Apatow's third film, Funny People, and I only hope that it is as funny and sincere as his previous two films have been."

","Judd Appatow's second film, Knocked up, was better than The $0 year old virgin. Though I loved that film also. Knocked up is a great film for many reasons. I like the entire cast, it's funny throughout, and it is sweet. Seth Rogen is a lovable character. Though he is a smoker, a drinker, and a dirty person, he is still a good guy. I mean you don't have to be bad to be all of those things. I love Kathrine Heigl also. Like with Jim Carrey, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Grant, i'm always willing to see her films. I Liked her in My Father the Hero, which was her first film. Well, at least I think it is at least. The film stars many funny people. Like Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Paul Rudd, and Leslie Mann(Who is actually Judd Appatow's wife. She has been in all three of his films. The 40 year old virgin, Funny People, and this). Knocked up's mind is sometime dirty. But it's heart is pure and the film itself is sweet."

","Knocked Up won me over by it's sheer brilliance. The screenplay is really funny. The dialogue is hilarious, and the characters believable and three-dimensional. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are fantastic. They play their characters with comedic timing, and with flawed, but ultimately likable tone. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann are also brilliant, their characters you totally invest with and play a real-life issue in their marriage. The rest of the cast, from Jonah Hill to Jason Segal to the rest, are also brilliant and hilarious. It has crude humor, and the film really made me laugh out loud to plain smile at it's brilliance. Ultimately, what I think grabbed me more was it's heart. This is not one of those R-rated comedies where it is just about the humor. You care for these characters and their problems, and you relate to them. It also provoked some discussion about both unwanted pregnancy and marriage status. I think that is the reason why this might just be my favorite comedy of the last ten years. It is perfect film-making, and Judd Apatow's finest film of course. An instant comedy classic for sure"

","I was quite skeptical about this movie because I 'm not much of a fan of Apatow's work. To my surprise, 'Knocked Up' wasn't as bad. It was quite funny for the most parts. I enjoyed the numerous references to other movies. The jokes are very American, thus one can expect plenty of toilet humour some of which is plain repulsive, but otherwise can draw a few chuckles.<br/><br/>I also thought it was interesting how the men and women were portrayed. The guys are more relaxed and chilled-out while the women (there are only two who play the main characters) are whiny and demanding. Debbie seems to be the ultimate desperate whiny housewife and she rubs part of that on to Alison who, in effect, responds negatively towards Ben. Even though it is a comedy, I thought this was an interesting take on a modern married couple. While Pete is trying to find some quality time for himself in order to avoid a nervous breakdown, Debbie wants all his free time to be spent with her.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl is superb as knocked up Alison. I especially enjoyed her reactions to Ben and his friends. Seth Rogan, for the most parts, is a lot less annoying than he usually is. Paul Rudd is great and Leslie Mann isn't bad in playing the bitchy wife and unintentionally manipulative sister. Of the supporting cast, Jason Segel and Jay Baruchel are good while Jonah Hill is painfully annoying.<br/><br/>'Knocked Up' isn't a bad watch. It's fun enough to watch with friends and have a few laughs."
"GodsPrototype","4","0","1","13 April 2009"," Tries to be too clever for its own good!
","This is not the funniest comedy of all time but some people will tell you it is. The humour and the script are very well written but it's not laugh-out-loud comedy such as 'There's something about Mary' or 'Airplane'. There are a few moments that'll make you laugh loud like the time when he's having sex with his pregnant girlfriend and the mushroom trip in Las Vegas but that really is it.<br/><br/>You wanna see a funny movie about drugs go and see 'Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas' a far superior film. 'Knocked up' tries really hard to impress its peers and in doing so is too clever for it's own good. The constant references to other films and in-film jokes have been overused before and this goes over the top.<br/><br/>The writers try and impress you with their knowledge of the film industry and nude scenes in Hollywood films but it's just not really that funny and kind of embarrassing at times. The birth scene with the close up of a certain female part is well done but only used to make people remember the film, in a film where there is not really that much to remember.<br/><br/>I was disappointed when seeing this film but maybe I had been misled by reviews of this movie stating that the vulgar, sometimes sick comedy is hilariously good fun. It is a different film to what I was expecting and runs like a semi serious romantic comedy about the effects of pregnancy. If the film was marketed a little better for what it actually encapsulates then it could have been a very different story.<br/><br/>But there are some good points, if you take the film on face value rather than the 'funniest comedy of 2007' that it clearly is not then you will have a good film to watch. The constant cameos by varied stars are a welcome input into the film but again, trying too hard to be loved as a film.<br/><br/>Instead of laughing out loud most of the time you'll find yourself nodding a few moments later and smirking to yourself thinking'yeah, that was kind of funny'and that is it! It's well written humour and intelligent humour and if this is what you like then this may be the greatest comedy of all time but in my opinion it's just an alright film and is not full of constant hilarious gags as we had been misled to expect. 5/10"

Here's my IMDb.com review.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" starts Seth Rogen (in his best work since a guest appearance in ""Dawson's Creek"") and Katherine Heigl (in her finest role since she played Sarah in ""Under Siege 2) as Ben and Alsion, two people who hook up in a night club and have a one night stand. Ben is a loser stoner, Sarah an up and coming entertainment reporter. The next morning Sarah realises what a loser Ben is and quickly tries to end it quickly....until she discovers she's pregnant. Sarah then decides to track Ben down and get him to be a part of this unexpected surprise. She soon learns although he's a complete loser who spends his time hitting the pipe and watching movies with ladies with no clothes on, he's sweet too. Sarah has to work out though if she wants to shack up with him and become a family or to have the child and try to continue on her career path and hopefully meet someone fancier.<br/><br/>It's pretty rude and crude, with lots of sweet ""ohhhhhh"" moments to balance it out.... sorta. Some potential jokes were left hanging, while others where done to death. Ben's housemates provided plenty of laughs and really stole most of the great scenes. Jason Segel as Jason was probably my favourite character in the movie. Pretty funny overall, but plenty of awkward, uncomfortable moments."

For Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) everything should have been just party and more party yet without any girl just with his cool friends (Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Jason Segel and Martin Starr), , all together having the usual routine. They had fun together but what's the only way to watch these two making love? Well you know, it was a crazy night for both so in the next morning we have again these two as the two total different persons that they are from each other; obviously Alison is the ""affected"" one and the one who is going to be cruel. So what's the only way to make that Alison needs to see Ben again? The title of the movie says everything. <br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" was for me the last movie to watch of the Apatow ""family""releases from 2007. And yes they are like a family so here everybody is quite known so in that way basically everybody is kind of making a role that they had already made, basically is like they were not even acting, specially Jonah Hill. Again Seth Rogen and his ""brother"" Jonah Hill ""command"" the gang that will deliver hilarious stuff, those are a bunch of cool friends from Canada, stoners and hard-workers. The main problem is that basically their work doesn't give them any money since their website is cumming soon but soon the other problem will be related with the fact that their cummming soon website is nothing new. On the other side we have a family that have it all but is full of distrust. I understand why Katherine Heigl is pointed this film as sexist, she said that the film ""paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys"". Sure but it is just a movie and not because the sister of Alison (played by Leslie Mann) is not a very likable character (yes she is a bitch!) every woman is like her obviously. Here you will be a hundred percent on the side of Pete (Paul Rudd) -he was out just to play fantasy baseball!- who will be basically Ben's friend to turn this at a point in the men vs. women kind of stuff (going to Cirque du Soleil with mushrooms is not a good idea!). Anyway, this is a funny movie; it makes that our Big Lebowski-like character changes from being a simple lazy stoner to be a productive guy. After all he was a f****** lucky guy, yes he was very lucky! <br/><br/>For me happens with this movie the same that with ""Superbad"", both are not the masterpieces of comedy that many were and are claiming but both are very enjoyable movies that I do recommend and that I do liked a lot. With ""Knocked Up"" happens also that it has been pointed for having pro-life themes just like ""Juno"". If you are wondering I'm pro-choice and these are just movies and both have their characters in a situation and with specific circumstances. Obviously that doesn't need and are not to be seen as if they were true. Anyway, I think that between ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Superbad"", ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" and ""Knocked Up"" my least favourite is this one but obviously that doesn't mean that it was a sort of disappointment, finally it is as entertaining, enjoyable and funny as I was expecting. These movies are those kind of movies that, with the ""pretext"" of showing them to your girlfriend, family, etc., are very easy to enjoy more than just a single time. That's very nice. Oh and if you were wondering, for an odd reason, about my title, well that's a line of a Kings of Leon song that shares title with this movie."

","The only value in this project is that it is such an obvious lesson in how advanced the study of demographics really has become.<br/><br/>The two largest groups film-makers (at least studio-subservient film-makers) aim for are men, and women. It's a risky and delicate practice to try to appeal to both within the same film, and there are various approaches to doing so, and the most common is to find some common ground between the sexes and exploit it. For instance, Spielberg's wild success came from appealing to the child in each viewer, a common ground shared across gender lines.<br/><br/>This is different, in what seems a modern fashion, revealing its highly-engineered skeleton. Here there is no common ground. Instead these guys have attempted to merge two genres: the romantic drama (for the ladies,) and the stoner comedy (men enjoy a good laugh at themselves, you see.) To pull this off, a delicate interweaving of elements is required to tie the two genres together seamlessly, a requisite which fails here. Th result is jarring in that the two characters (from different genres) seem wholly incompatible. It's just too unrealistic.<br/><br/>I personally thought the chick-flick half was done more competently. Great comedy is born of pain, but when that pain is emphasized the comedy saddens. And this is sad comedy to begin with.<br/><br/>I also disliked ""Superbad"" but feel it's a notch better than this one, given the fact that it doesn't make this same mistake of taking itself seriously."

","After watching Superbad, I watched this movie expecting something totally different. I ended up enjoying it. I can agree with other posts, Ben's supporting cast members were lacking throughout the movie. The really didn't offer much outside of their views on abortion. I would have liked to see Ben's friends offer more than just crude-predictable ""jackass"" worthy humor even if they were potheads. (Some of our greatest musicians have been potheads. Their work still counts!!)<br/><br/>I didn't really care for the women in this movie though. They were very annoying and bratty at best. I am a woman and ended up sympathizing with Debbie's husband. She was like an adult toddler in their terrible twos! I get the humor behind men surrendering to women in relationships. But I wish we could get past this and show more depth to relationships--even in comedies. Nothing puts brakes on comedy faster than a whiny woman going off on her mate over something stupid and justifying the tantrum being she's female. UGH! (Remember, Meet the Parents and the cat? Oh come on!). Or the way Heigl's character treats Ben in the doctor's office. Granted his response is no better. And flares up again at Debbie later---in a way that's disrespectful towards women. I understand the need to poke fun at this but this is just cheap, lazy humor. The women in the movie always want their cake and ice cream at their mate's expense. They can be bratty but they should rely on the excuse, it's because we are women and men just don't understand, etc. <br/><br/>The one element I loved about this movie was Harold Ramis' speech on babies. I felt this was tastefully done and expressed what the movie was trying to convey. My abortion views aside, it was heartwarming to hear a man express his joyous views on fatherhood. He looked at his son with optimism and gave him courage and support. To me, even though Ben's life was not going according to plan and most of society would deem him a loser, his father still had a great deal of faith in him. Ben downplays it, his father's words stick with him later in the movie.<br/><br/>People will always have sex. But I like where this movie goes with its message. Yes, on the surface, people can focus in on Ben's appearance and say this is boring. But underneath, the ""crowning"" scene, the F words, and drugged, porn-obsessed junkies, there is a subtle message that anyone can take responsibility and we shouldn't write off anyone based on what we see but look at their actions. Yes, this message is not original and it's overdone but it's not nearly as irritating as the women in this movie!"

I am not a big film of the Frat Pack type comedies but there were good reviews for Knocked Up at the time.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is as the title suggests, a woman getting pregnant after a one night stand. The main character of the film is Allison (Katherine Heigl), a woman working for E! and was given the chance to become a presenter. At the same time Ben (Seth Rogen) is a lazy, unemployed young man who lived with his friends and was working on a website that tells people when a nude scene was in a movie. Allison and her sister decide to celebrate her promotion by going for the night and in a bar Allison meets Ben. The two of them get drunk and go back the Allison's. Whilst getting ready for the act of love Ben struggles to put protection on. Allison tell him to hurry up and he misunderstands and goes on unprotected. The obvious result was that she gets pregnant and the film focuses on Allison and Ben's relationship afterwards.<br/><br/>The film was advised as a comedy in the mould of Frat Pack comedy. However this film did not have the slapstick or silliness you would expect from those sort of films and Knocked Up was must more serious movie. I put it down to the subject matter that the film matter. There were issues of relationships and parenthood in this movie. There was also a sub-plot between Allison's sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her relationship with her husband. There was also the issue about Ben having to grow up and face his responsibilities. The film did make me smile and chuckle, but was belly arching laugher. It was an okay movie, but nothing special. Okay to watch if it was on TV."

","When this movie came out in theaters I thought it was going to be a boring romance movie. That was before I knew that it was from the guys who made Anchorman, 40 year old virgin and Talledega night, all movies that I adore. So when it came out on DVD I was first in line to rent it. It was amazing. There was stuff for the girls and guys. It managed to pack in sex, lots of cursing crude disgusting jokes( which was my favorite parts, made me laugh my ass off) and nudity and still managed too put in a healthy amount of drama and heart. But the heart wasn't forced in like any other comedy, it was real. And the sisters side story is a good add on for the girls. Seth Rogen, who is and always will be my favorite actor, rocked the hell out of this. All and All if you like comedies but find they have gotten a little silly, this is the movie for you."

I at least expected something tat would cheer me up, but this was just too infuriating for that. I'm used to suspending disbelief in order to enjoy science fantasy films, but I find it very hard to suspend disbelief when it comes to films that are supposedly situated in real life.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl's character would never, NEVER, **NEVER** sleep with this guy - even if she was drunk. Having done the impossible deed, it is even more unlikely that she would actually grow to like the idiot afterwards - let alone love him.<br/><br/>I think I got 4 or 5 vague laughs out of it, so it wasn't all bad, but the basic premise that this gorgeous, successful woman would hook up with a sad, tubby loser with even worse loser friends is just too hard to accept."

"dfle3","6","0","1","20 March 2008"," When Slacker met Yuppie
","Being facetious, one could say that the premise of the movie is pure science fiction fantasy: a somewhat overweight dope-smoking slacker somehow meets an absolutely beautiful woman who has been promoted to an on-air role on an entertainment TV programme.<br/><br/>The beautiful woman in question is Katherine Heigl, who plays Alison Scott. She has a terrific dead-pan persona when dealing with the slacker's ways & attitudes (the slacker is Ben Stone, played by Seth Rogen)...a real poker-face. I'm not sure if Heigl's teeth have been done by Industrial Light & Magic, but they are hard to look at without sunglasses.<br/><br/>Anyway, as a result of Scott & Stone's union, Scott gets pregnant. This serves as the premise for which this odd couple spend more time with each other than one would ordinarily expect.<br/><br/>Much of the humour arises from Stone's slacker ways (along with his friends too...each of which is horrifyingly interesting...like a car-crash). The way Scott doesn't give anything away in dealing with Stone is also funny.<br/><br/>The good thing about this movie is the way that the comedic load is shared amongst the cast...from the main players to people with minor roles. E.g. the scenes with Scott's superiors are very funny...especially her female superior, who is a bit of a seething mass of resentment towards Alison.<br/><br/>Or the married couple Scott and Stone hang out with (the wife is Scott's sister). Both married characters get to steal a few scenes with their face pulling or outrageous opinions.<br/><br/>I especially like the scene where Alison's sister just has a melt-down when a black bouncer refuses to let her and Alison into a night club. What is even better is when the black bouncer gets to say some good lines in response.<br/><br/>For me, the movie tends to fall a bit towards the end.i.e.when Ben and the husband take magic mushrooms before seeing Cirque de Soleil. It isn't quite as funny as it sounds.<br/><br/>Things pick up for the funny birth scene."

","From the writer/director of The 40-Year-Old Virgin, this is a pretty good ""romantic"" comedy, which I preferred much more than the following film from the same makers, Superbad. Basically slob/slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is in the process of establishing flesh of the stars.com, a website listing nudity times for famous actresses nude scenes in films (he later finds out Mr. Skin has already done this). Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is a responsible young woman who works behind the scenes on the E! Television Network. They meet each other at a club where they are celebrating the promotion of Alison's sister. Anyway, they get drunk together, and get into bed together, and when he gets the condom out, and she says ""Just get on with it"", he mistakes her and throws it away. Next morning, they realise they have nothing in common and go their separate ways. Eight weeks pass, Alison begins feeling sick a lot, and after countless pregnancy tests, she is positive on all of them. She gets in contact with Ben, and he is at first shocked and also angry that she has decided to keep it (oh, they confirmed it with a scan). After this, they start spending more time together, and do actually start to have laughs and slowly fall for each other. Obviously there is a big argument as she gets nearer to giving birth, and Ben obviously thinks it's Alison's hormones, but don't worry, they get back together at the birth and there is a happy ending with their new baby girl. Also starring Paul Rudd as Pete, George of the Jungle's Leslie Mann as Debbie, Jason Segel as Jason, Jay Baruchel as Jay, Superbad's Jonah Hill as Jonah, Martin Starr as Martin, Ghostbusters' Harold Ramis as Ben's Dad, A Knight's Tale's Alan Tudyk as Jack and Bill Hader as Brent, with cameos (for the E! Network segments) including Jessica Alba, The 40-Year-Old Virgin's Steve Carell, Andy Dick, Spider-Man's James Franco, Eva Mendes, E!'s Ryan Seacrest and Punk'd actor Dax Shepard. With some good gags, a realistic plot and a good old fashioned love-hate relationship, a really good film. Very good!"

","Well see, I'm a huge fan of Katie Heigl. She's just such a great actress, she's so talented and gorgeous. She acted well in this movie too. All the actors/actresses acted well.<br/><br/>The beginning of 'Knocked Up' really disappointed me. I was so looking forward to see this movie but I think the beginning is just a bit ordinary. It was a little boring. But there's one dialog I laughed so much about, this is probably one of the bests: Jack: We decided that, we want you to be on camera. Alison Scott: Oh my god,really? Jill: I know, I was so surprised too. I love what Jill says. What I really loved to was the unshown scene in which Alison interviews Eva Mendez, it's very funny what they're talking about and how Alison reacts on what Eva says. Great scene! Why wasn't it shown in the movie?<br/><br/>The part of the movie where Alison and Ben try to live together, is very funny and I started to enjoy watching the movie. It became very funny. All in all this movie shows how fast it could happen to lose his single life because of a one One-Night-Stand. I think this movie shows good the risk but it's not like a documentary it's a comedy which shows it and I think this is great. Seth Rogen and Katie Heigl were such a great screen couple and I could imagine to see them in another movie too. There was such a great chemistry between them. But I really want to mention Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann too because they really did a great job too, even I think that Paul's acting wasn't as good as I know it from 'Friends'. Well, this was a nice entertainment but it's not the best comedy I've ever seen. It's average. But watch it yourself to see if you think other!"

Sure, there are some funny moment, but they do not make up for the rest of the movie. Katherine Heigl was one of my favorites in Grey's Anatomy, but here, unfortunately, she was below average. Seth Rogen was alright. The ""guy"" jokes are extremely immature and unfunny, and probably only enjoyed by frat boys after several beers and then some. And this is coming from someone who liked American Pie and Borat. From now on, I am going to find a few frequent IMDb reviewers whose opinions I agree with and read their reviews before renting anything! My only consolation is that I didn't see it in a theater."

","To begin, this movie is not extremely funny. It has it's clever moments, but all in all it is nothing special. The storyline is slightly boring, and gets worse as the movie progresses. The worst thing about Knocked Up is that it is very long, too long, to be a good comedy. It is about 2 hours and roughly 10 minutes of, well, honestly, nothing special. In my opinion, a good thriller/horror/action movie can easily be 2 hours or more and it is still great. Hey, even a good comedy can pull off two hours. But this movie cannot. Had it not been so long and drug out, say 1 hour and 30 minutes, it could possibly earn 5 stars out of 10 from me. If you watch this movie and don't find yourself thinking 'will this ever end?', consider yourself lucky. Therefore, don't rent this movie. It's not worth it, there are many much better movies out there. If your going to watch Knocked Up, then don't start the movie thinking it's going to be great. In the end, it's just a middle of the pack, slow moving comedy that really can't make you laugh."

This was a great movie i enjoyed it thoroughly, it was a very clever drama dealing with very strong issues and real life problems this is now one of my favourite movies. it is a sweet yet so very real film, you can almost imagine fully what Alison is going thru and you can feel her suffering. i could imagine that someone going thru this situation would find this movie very helpful and motivating.

"viss1","8","0","1","13 December 2007"," Decent, but doesn't live up to the hype
","I fail to see why critics gushed over this flick. So much was made of the plot concept, Seth Rogen's charm, and certain ""shocking"" birthing scenes (which were actually only risqué if you consider simulations of the birthing process shocking) that the movie's flaws seem to have been overlooked.<br/><br/>The most major flaw was the failed realization of the Pete & Debbie relationship. Their marriage was supposed to be the vehicle through which Ben & Alison could see themselves in 10 years, and also to provide examples of issues faced in a mature marriage. The concept failed completely due to miscasting the Debbie role and writing her as an irrational and whiny control freak. Rather than providing a balanced and stimulating study of a mature marriage, the Debbie character came across as so annoying that I had absolutely no sympathy for her. In fact, I literally almost turned off the movie during one of her more irritating diatribes.<br/><br/>Second, Rogen's roommates were moderately amusing at best. I applaud the use of relative unknowns in these roles, but none of them exuded quite enough personality to make their individual character stand out. I realize Apatow was going more for realism than cartoonish characterizations, but seeing as how the roommates were the main source of comic relief, a little more ""Animal House"" here would have been welcome.<br/><br/>I didn't have a real problem with other aspects of the film. Rogen was indeed the standout of the movie, and Heigl also delivered an excellent performance. Paul Rudd was sympathetic and amusing.<br/><br/>Was it the ""comedy event of the year?"" No. Were there enough chuckles to make it worthwhile? Yes. Does Apatow deserve his ""young genius"" reputation? Not based solely on this flick."
"johnleemk","9","0","1","13 December 2007"," Realistic drama with some humour thrown in
","The premise of Knocked Up is pretty simple: unattractive slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) meets successful journalist Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and gets her pregnant. They struggle trying to get along romantically, while at the same time dealing with Alison's sister and brother-in-law, whose own problems affect their relationship.<br/><br/>What struck me about the movie is despite its irreverent tone, and its obvious intention to be a comedy, it is really a realistic dramatic portrayal of two things: having a child after a one-night stand, and the tension of a romantic relationship between two people whose characters just don't fit.<br/><br/>When I first saw the posters for the movie, I was not willing to give it a chance - I wasn't sure how they could pull off the concept without coming off as some stupid teenage boy-centric fantasy, and although 40-Year Old Virgin was funny, it did not really tackle any important issues.<br/><br/>Knocked Up pleasantly surprised me by dealing with the issues it raises in a realistic way - to a point. I can't speak to dealing with sex during pregnancy, or parenting, but I know what it's like to have parents who do not get along but were thrown together by happenstance, and I have to say Knocked Up presents things pretty well. I could very well see my parents voicing a lot of the frustrations of Pete and Debbie, the hapless in-laws of Alison.<br/><br/>It is this serious willingness to grapple with such difficult issues, in what is essential a comedic drama, that makes me give Knocked Up so high marks. Its brand of humour for me was really the sideshow to the more interesting story of how the characters deal with the situations life has handed them.<br/><br/>One thing I had trouble grasping, though, was how easily the movie brushes aside the subject of abortion. I personally believe abortion is wrong, but I understand why people would want it as an option, and the movie simply does not deal with the subject adequately - Alison never has a good reason not to abort - in fact she has all the reasons to terminate the pregnancy - but yet she decides to keep the baby. This is obviously necessary for the plot, but the lack of explanation makes it a bit of a startling loose end.<br/><br/>If you want sex and humour, without a serious message or theme, Knocked Up won't be your cup of tea. But if you can handle the movie's irreverence and want a movie that positively addresses real problems, Knocked Up is a movie you should see."

","Judd Apatow, director of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", has finally achieved something many modern comedic filmmakers attempt, and fail at fully attaining... He has crafted a silly, fun, touching and heartwarming movie that manages to deliver the goods ten-fold, with a tale that is relevant and astonishingly well-made.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" tells the story of rising career-woman Alison (played by the very charming Katherine Heigl), whom has just been informed by her superiors that she is ready to do on-camera work. (She currently works as an assistant at the E! channel) With her sister Debbie (played by Leslie Mann, in a cute but feisty performance) by her side, she celebrates by going clubbing and having a fun time, as many would. However, on this fateful night, she meets the goof-ball Ben (played with perfection by Seth Rogan), an obnoxious but good-hearted slacker with no job, who lives with four stoner friends.<br/><br/>Despite being polar opposites, the booze gets the better of them, and they end up in a one night stand. After having something of a falling out the next morning (Alison is slightly bothered by Ben's blunt, anything-goes attitude) they part ways.<br/><br/>Some weeks later, Alison realizes she is pregnant, and the movie is off. After finding out, Ben goes through the round of emotions... He is angry... He is nervous... He worries... But he decides that it is his responsibility to help Alison, and support her decision to keep the baby.<br/><br/>From there on in, it is a tale of companionship, romance and emotion... Ben and Alison slowly begin to fall in love with one another, but their circumstances (and misunderstandings) threaten to tear them apart. Interstingly, we also get a somewhat-similar parallel story happening, in which Debbie and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd), whom are married with children, go through a slew of emotions... the tolls of marriage looming over them.<br/><br/>What makes the film work for me, and so many others who love it, is the fact that it all feels real to a degree. Unlike other comedies, which will exaggerate situations and jokes, everything feels natural in this film. I could honestly see this very story happening in real life... (Which it did, in part... As portions of the film were based on the pregnancy of Leslie Mann, whom is married to writer/director Apatow.) And the superb acting doesn't hurt, either. Rogan is charming as Ben, and you can clearly see he is struggling with his decisions... He obviously has a fairly good life, living with his best friends, his only work being the current construction of a pseudo-pornographic website... But he has to grow up.<br/><br/>Heigle is also spectacular... She makes us feel for her in ways that many actresses cannot, and I suspect she is going to become one of the greatest young actresses of this time.<br/><br/>Mann and Rudd are both a wonderful addition to the story, giving an interesting perspective on the situation by people who have ""been there, done that"" with kids and pregnancy, and the Debbie/Alison relationship fits right in, not feeling forced.<br/><br/>And the comedy, though vulgar, is very funny, and never subtracts from the story.<br/><br/>Finally, before I wrap up, let me just say that the small, cameo-esquire rolls by a number of pop-culture icons (including Ryan Seacrest in a hilarious rant) and the addition of Harold Ramis as Ben's father were nice touches.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" is one of those rare films that will have you doubled-over from laughter consistently, while at the same time (and I'm sorry, I know I sound stupid saying this) tugging at you inside. It is a sweet portrayal of responsibility and love, and a rare treat.<br/><br/>Plus, the hilarious gross-out and insult humor, and some brief instances of celebrity nudity (as seen on the guys' TV) doesn't hurt either.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","Picture a passionate sceneA guy and a girl are about to have sex and he's having troubles with his condom; he can't seem to be able to put it on. The girl says: ""Just do it already"". Maybe a normal guy would interpret the phrase as what it means, but not Ben Stone (Seth Rogen): he throws the condom to the floorAnd he gets Alison (Katherine Heigl) pregnant.<br/><br/>I haven't laughed so hard with a movie since I don't know when. ""Knocked Up"" is a romantic comedy unlike any romantic comedy and better than the average romantic comedy. The reason? I would have to say Judd Apatow: the guy who gave ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" its few laughs, the writer/director of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and the mastermind behind this. Apatow really knows how to have fun. Characters the same names as the actors who play them, freshness in each scene, unexpected comedic resolutions during typical moments; that is all Apatow.<br/><br/>Take this for example, continuing with what I wrote in the first paragraph. Alison and Ben wake up after having sex and leave the house for breakfast. They encounter Alison's sister Debbie (a brilliant Leslie Mann) and his husband Pete (a brilliant Paul Rudd) with their two little kids. ""Don't ever do what they just did"", Pete tells his four-year-old daughter. ""I'm gonna do it"", she answers. Or another scene where Debbie thinks Pete is cheating on her; finds an address and goes there with Ben and Alison to check it out. She's angry, and as soon as she leaves the car, Ben asks Alison: ""Is she carrying a gun?"".<br/><br/>The audience doesn't expect these lines and the laughs flow naturally. If they are improvised or not is unimportant; what matters is that Apatow is directing them and allows their inclusion in the film. If there's one problem with ""Knocked Up"" is that it runs a little bit long, but it doesn't make it worse than the wonder it is.<br/><br/>It is a wonder because in its long duration, it manages to combine comedy, drama and romance in an enviable way. It's not always the most active movie, but it doesn't have to be; it's not always funny and sometimes it is when it's not supposed to; it's romantic in the most classic way and it's helped by a classic plot line with zero surprises. However, in all this predictable plot line, ""Knocked Up"" has a quality that only few comedies achieve: it knows its time(s).<br/><br/>Besides, it creates its own language and it makes us part of it very quickly; it takes the chance to be critical about the Hollywood Business with intelligent humor. But most importantly (and this was also palpable in ""The 40 Yea Old Virgin""), and as another rare characteristic, it truly cares for its characters who are interesting, flawed and real human beings.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen constructs a lovable creature, like one of those big bears you want to hug, surpassing the promise he showed in 'Virgin'; while Katherine Heigl looks more beautiful than in ""Grey's Anatomy"" and creates a completely different and believable character from her Izzie Stevens. When I wrote about 'Virgin' I said Apatow was more a planner than a directorHe still is, if we consider Eric Edward's cinematography, with very little creativity.<br/><br/>But the directing side of Apatow comes to light from another side: from the double sense of names (Ben Stone; you'll see once you're inside the movie), from little posters in rooms and books in bookstores and photographs and references that seem to declare his inspirations. Then, we can see him through these things. We can see the man behind the camera, and let me tell you it's a good place the one where he comes from."

""Knocked Up"" is a funny movie, and I suppose the younger generation expects comedies to be filled with foul language and very crude sexual references, but this movie would actually have been much better if it had been toned down.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen is Ben Stone, a slacker and part of a larger slacker group of 20-something guys who spend most of every day thinking and talking about sex, while smoking pot, and never realistically expecting to get any. At least not from any decent young lady. They seem to be developing a website that will allow a viewer to find movies that their favorite actors have appeared nude in, and at what exact times in the movie.

Elated, she and her married sister go out to celebrate. At a night spot, quite by accident because the bar tender was so slow, Alison and Ben meet. He isn't really the kind of guy she would be attracted to, she isn't the kind of lady he really would expect to get very far with, but aided by the personality lubricant we call alcohol, they end up at her place, in bed. Via a very badly missed communication they end up having sex without protection and, 8 weeks later ... you guessed it, pregnant.<br/><br/>The script and story truly are bright and entertaining, but the crude language really detracts from it.

He and his not-all-there buds (ha! check out the double meaning) are in the process of launching a website dedicated to finding nudity in mainstream movies.

So she heads out to a club with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and winds up hooking up with Ben. Of course, she was drunk at the time - Heigl is a pinup model and Rogen is a fat slob. So you know it's sort of true to life in that sense.<br/><br/>Fast forward eight weeks later, and Alison's preggers. Whoopsie daisy. Now how will these two lustbirds reconcile the fact that they don't really know each other with this impending birth? Or, for that matter, the fact that while sober neither has anything in common with the other? As I said, scenes that are supposed to be funny usually work, because Rogen is just doofy enough to pull it off; the film works when it pokes fun at Ben's slacker proclivities or the idiosyncrasies of his friends. It doesn't work so much in the way the women are portrayed, however. Look, we've all enjoyed movies in which women are mere objects, right? Porky's, I'm looking at you! Done right, that sort of approach can be raucously entertaining. But in this movie, the womenfolk alternately come off as wildly bitchy or just humorless. Alison was never really shown to have much of a sense of humor (although there's one scene in which she helps the boys spot nude scenes in films for their website).<br/><br/>That's all well and good regardless, because some movies can manage to have ""bad"" female characters off of which the males can play. But that's where the schizophrenia of this movie comes into play; is it a low-brow, misogynistic comedy or a relationship movie? Too often, it opted for the latter, and if you're trying to show the trials and tribulations of two crazy kids who aren't even in love with each other, you shouldn't make one of them unlikable and irrational. Even if, you know, that's how it'd be in real life.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow, who brought us similarly flawed The 40 Year Old Virgin, compares the burgeoning Ben-Alison relationship to the marriage of Debbie and Pete. Oops, looks like Pete's an inconsiderate jerk! Looks like Debbie's an overreacting, hyperactive nitwit! Of course, Apatow's not saying theirs is the ideal relationship for which Ben and Alison should strive, but he makes it seem as if just having an relationship is a bad idea.<br/><br/>And I know I might be in the minority here, but I've never liked humor that serves only to humiliate someone. So when Ben or Alison launches a profanity-laced attack on the other, that's not funny. It's not even entertaining. It's annoying.<br/><br/>(Another recurring theme was that Debbie feels unappreciated. Check out the scene in which she and Alison are turned away from a club - Alison because she's pregnant and Debbie because she's, um, old. Leslie Mann is two years younger than me, it should be noted; anyway, the scene is presumably supposed to show the sisters bonding over their respective rejections, but all it did was show Debbie as whiny.) One plus, though - good to see Alan Tudyk (Wash from Firefly) getting some work; here, he's Alison's boss. His rotten-bitch-sycophant assisant has to go, though. She, like some of the other secondary and tertiary characters, was just thoroughly obnoxious and useless - not funny in the biting, sarcastic way, just caustic and off-putting."

","Knocked Up is an interesting film that could involve a very serious subject. What if you became pregnant from someone who does little but smoke, give movie references, has nothing but junk (eg. ninja knives?) and has no real job. Heck, he's even in the country illegally! Would he even read up on pregnancy? Would you be like Allison and give the relationship a shot? Or would you eventually just try to make things work with your family in regards to bringing the baby into this world? I felt like the sentimentality dominated the film more than the issue of time. Even after seeing a heartbeat, the baby growing, the hormones, that Ben didn't try harder until Allison kicked him out.<br/><br/>Ben Stone and his buddies go out for a night on the town. He runs into a successful woman in the entertainment industry who just recently won a promotion. After a drunken, hurried one night stand, she ends up pregnant.<br/><br/>I found Knocked Up to be a little harsh in its views, as Ben threw any integrity out the window for the sake of his blunt and unethical honesty. In the end, everybody seems to do what's right at the last second, only in the face of a crisis mind you, but Knocked Up is a happy ending. I thought Katherine Heigl did an excellent job as Allison, as her character grew more adjusted to Ben and his buddies. Leslie Mann also pulled out a great performance too. Judd Apatow probably has pulled out his best work here to date. Many questions I ask, mainly what was Pete thinking about when him and Ben went to the strip club in Vegas? Would Allison have called Ben if their doctor wasn't available? What was really up with that Pete guy anyway? Lastly, did anybody really think of this as a romance comedy, cause aside from Ben's slacker friends picking up the one who couldn't shave, I couldn't find myself laughing at anything!"

","Writer and director Judd Apatow's follow-up to 2005's ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" is, while not reaching the high earnestness of the film that basically launched Steve Carrell's leading man career, still a funny and affectionate movie.<br/><br/>Here, Katherine Heigl plays Alison Scott, a producer for E! who just got a promotion when the unexpected happens. He meets with Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), an indolent would-be internet businessman, in a bar. They get drunk, have sex, and before long she discovers she's pregnant.<br/><br/>Lead stars Rogen and Heigl play their roles with spot-on effectiveness and aplomb. Rogen doesn't have the charisma of Carrell, nor is his character as lovable as the latter's Andy, but he provides enough likability and immaturity to his Ben that it's not a chore at all to invest on his character emotionally at the point the film requires the audience to do so. Heigl exudes the class and professionalism required of her character, and she shares a genuine chemistry with Rogen.<br/><br/>All the while, Apatow's script and direction fill the film with plenty of raunchiness and wit. The comedy never fully resorts to mindless slapstick. The film does run a bit too long, but you might as well be amused you won't feel it. Besides, the movie overall feels sincere in addressing the issues it tackles it's easy not to feel dirty about it afterward."
"skexis64","7","0","1","15 October 2007"," A Charming Look at Sexual Politics and Genre Bending
","Striking while the iron was hot, Judd Apatow ended up filming two more movies in quick succession to his big success, 40 Year Old Virgin. We of course know them as ""Knocked Up,"" and ""Superbad."" Compared to the other movies, however, Knocked Up quickly stands out as something of an oddity. It doesn't seem to have as many jokes per capita that the other two do. And with good reason, because it's not a straight up comedy.<br/><br/>The movie walks the line between what's become known as the ""gross out"" comedy, which is usually a bunch of guys who get in crazy predicaments, and the wacky dialogue they give to each other that supplements the action, and the romantic comedy, where the guy and the gal, despite some unforeseen problem, manage to find true love.<br/><br/>When you step back from the movie and look at how the narrative flows, you find that what it really does is try to work both ends against each other. In essence the movie is asking its viewers of both sexes to meet each other half way. I found it fascinating to watch the change that sprang up from both main characters even as the movie asked the audience to do the same. (My favorite and most unexpected part of the movie was watching Alison looking for tits and bush in films to further Ben's website) With a movie that gambles like this, it's easy to see why so many users might want to rate it poorly. But this isn't really a conventional movie, despite how it was marketed, so it doesn't work trying to hold it to ""gross out"" comedy standards, and it doesn't really work to hold it up to romantic comedy standards either, because, obviously, it's trying to do both in a meager 2 hours.<br/><br/>Here's an example. A scene with Ben shows him tearing into Debbie because she wants to run his daughter's birthing. This is typical of a romantic comedy, where the jokes are about the characters bumping heads and the results are often emotionally driven. (This is also true of similar types of movies referred to as ""comedies of manners"") Ben's speech and Debbie's reaction *is* the joke. The very next scene, however, is Ben's friends fooling around with wheelchairs, doing physical and low-brow comedy, even mentioning Steven Hawking in a joke that is typical of a ""gross out"" comedy, that often goes for the lowest common denominator or the shock value of a joke.<br/><br/>This kind of back and forth leads me to believe that many of the jokes were placed strategically to try to encourage the couples in the audience to laugh at the same things, if only for a moment. Or, perhaps even to highlight the kind of gender differences that caused ""gross out"" and romantic comedies to be 2 different genres in the first place.<br/><br/>As a movie that tries to split the difference, though, it still doesn't work perfectly. It does seem weighted more towards the male point of view, and in many cases, the ""gross out"" part of the spectrum, which could leave female viewers feeling like they got cheated (Or like the movie never understood them in the first place, which could be a valid claim.) At the very least, however, this functions well as a romantic comedy that's made more appealing for guys. While it's not high on ""gross out"" humor, it manages to walk the line between the crude and the genuinely heartwarming.<br/><br/>Not perfect by any means, this movie tries to provide some common ground for couples and those in relationships, and succeeds, to some degree.<br/><br/>7/10 stars"

And in Nine Months Hugh Grant's character freaks out like no one has ever freaked out before.<br/><br/>Knocked Up tells a story of a different reaction. A one-night stand of a TV reporter and a less-than-careless guy who says the F-word more often than he says ""thank you"" turns this movie into anything but predictable flick.<br/><br/>A male viewer who has kids will probably want to grab a shotgun and kill the insensitive male who can't seem to help himself cursing in every dialog that involves the issue of responsibility. And a guy who wants to settle down and have babies will feel the urge to pull Katherine Heigl's character from the screen and propose to her. And you as a viewer ask yourself: Why is she losing her time with him, when she can find a normal guy who would want her with the baby? And what kind of a woman would fight to save the relationship like that? The movie serves the answer in small batches, one after another.

The film then charts the unexpected relationship as the pair decide to keep the baby and come together. There were plenty of jokes in the first half, many in poor taste, but that suits the genre. However, the later stages really dragged, with an endless birth scene and too much schmaltz. There was no need for a film of this type to attempt a serious element. Some of the scenes are funny, especially the sex scene where the baby is duly made. But by the end of the film, any laughs have worn off and I was relieved that it was all over!"

On top of that, the movie simply wasn't very funny.

For the most part a lot of the stoner jokes could be found in your average Cheech and Chong film.<br/><br/>The movie's too intelligent to be funny but not intelligent enough to be a black comedy. Knocked Up doesn't know what it wants to be in the long run. This lack of direction is what makes me give the film a negative view.

We feel for him more than we probably should in a comedy like this. I see a lot of dramatic potential in him too.

I had to laugh when I saw the trailers and tag lines.

","""Knocked Up"" is a manipulative comedy by writer-director Judd Apatow whose previous work has included the fabulous, short-lived television series ""Freaks & Geeks"" and the Steve Carrell vehicle ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"". Here again many attempts are made to interweave humor and heart, but unfortunately it fails to overcome its Monday night NBC feel.<br/><br/>The basic premise has ""Grey's Anatomy"" star Katherine Heigl and ""Freaks""-alum Seth Rogan having a one-time drunken hook-up that leads to an unplanned pregnancy. Unfortunately, as in many a sit-com she's a stunning, responsible, professional woman and he's a chubby, teddy bear of an immature loser with a deep indention in his couch. What's a girl to do? Well, in the world of Hollywood the answer lies in skimming the leaves off the ""Pygmalion"" pool one more time.<br/><br/>""Knocked Up"" isn't a bad movie, exactly. It's got plenty of laughs and a bit of the predictable third act sap, but part of the charm of ""Freaks & Geeks"" and ""Virgin"" was in Apatow's ability to create unique, believable characters that lived in what felt like the real world. This film doesn't really have that, but instead has caricatures playing out predictable gender stereotypes in an overly convenient storyline. This is standard comedy, and it's clear from previous viewing experience that Apatow is just better than this."

""Knocked Up"" is a miracle, a rare comedy with intelligence, written with respect for the characters by writer/director Judd Apatow (who was also behind the camera for ""Virgin"" two years ago). Apatow takes the time to let these characters grow on you, and to let them do a little growing themselves. Ben Stone (""Virgin"" alumni Seth Rogen) is a pot-smoking 20-something slacker who shares a hip bachelor pad with four other 20-something slackers who are hoping to begin raking in the dough with an Internet website that details your favorite actresses in their best movie nude scenes. Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is a career-driven celebrity newswoman who gets a promotion and is next seen interviewing big stars such as Steve Carell, James Franco, and Jessica Simpson with chatty ""Entertainment Tonight""-style patter. To celebrate, she goes with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) to a club where Ben and his buddies happen to be getting their grooves on. One thing leads to another and in a drunken romp back at her pad, the two hit it off in the sack. Eight weeks later, after Allison has put the somewhat boorish Ben behind her, she is shocked to discover she's pregnant - with Ben's child. Needless to say, neither takes the news lightly. Well, Ben and Allison decide they're going to try to make it work, for the baby's sake. ""Knocked Up"" is an intelligent comedy; I know I already said that but I'm going to say it again. What I found most appealing about this movie is that the two leads are real people, treated with dignity and respect by Apatow's writing, who in their own separate ways are really forced to grow up, fast, within a nine-month time-frame. And that's what this comedy is about - growing up. Before Allison came into his life, Ben was likely to remain an aimless slacker living with his best buds, smoking weed, boozing, and living off an insurance settlement from a few years earlier. Now with a baby on the way, he now knows that he has to take some responsibility and be a man. It's a transformation that is difficult for him but guaranteed that because ""Knocked Up"" is a Hollywood romantic comedy, he, Allison, and their new bundle of joy will turn out okay. The only problem I have (which I think is more personal than anything else) is that I would have liked to see a little bit of Ben and Allison in their new life together with their baby, married, and in a brand-new house.<br/><br/>10/10"

Seth Rogan does an excellent job of making a potentially obnoxious character appear sympathetic and attractive. The film would have failed spectacularly if we couldn't believe that Katherine Heigl's character would consider making a go of things with the lead actor.

While taking a sort of high-concept, gimmicky idea in order to set up the situation comedy, 40-Year-Old Virgin does succeed admirably in featuring honest, convincing and just totally real characters that you always believe in. With Knocked Up, Apatow and crew go even one step further by creating a movie so unbelievably rooted in reality, it may has well just have been a documentary about a bunch of naturally funny people and how they deal with a simple, small-scale domestic occurrence: A one night stand-turned-pregnancy.<br/><br/>The film is surprisingly poignant and intelligent, featuring a fantastically real-world story of learning to grow up and accept responsibility. ""Life doesn't care about your own life plans,"" the movie says, and within this lies the crux of just why Knocked Up is as sweet and poignant as it is. Rogen's Ben, while essentially being a personification of Rogen himself, does learn valuable life lessons and it is simply fantastic to see with what skill Apatow integrates this fictional character arc onto a non-fictional character (in a way).<br/><br/>That said, it is also, of course, total comic brilliance. Seth Rogen has really made a name for himself for one of the most naturally funniest performers working today - nothing he does ever feels forced, and judging by his character Ben's characteristics and history, one can easily see that Rogen is pretty much just playing himself in the movie. And he's got great taste too - t-shirts and movie discussions aside, the man has an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind poster hanging in the baby room. Brilliant! Paul Rudd also proves once again that he is comic genius.<br/><br/>In all, Knocked Up, along with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, just prove that there are some people in the word that are almost unfairly naturally funny. You see a ""comedy"" like Dude Where's My Car?, and you can just crystal-clearly see the massive difference between the forced, un-funny, cheap-shot comedy in the latter film as opposed to the real, intelligent and natural comedy of Apatow's ventures. I hope to see much more from these performers and filmmakers in the future. Because while Apatow's productions are funny enough (Anchorman, Talladega Nights, etc), it is his in his directorial ventures where he truly showcases an unprecedented knack of naturalistic, intelligent comedy. And it works fantastically well."
"uberprez","6","0","2","31 August 2007"," pretty disappointed to be honest, expecting more.
","i was pretty disappointed with this movie given the hype and high praise associated with it. maybe its because i went to see this with high expectations, but this is no excuse for a genre confused movie. is it comedy, romantic comedy, drama - i mean the last fifteen minutes contains such a serious undertone you almost feel guilty for laughing at any other jokes in it.<br/><br/>the story is pretty unlikely sure, but that for me isn't overly important in movies associated with people like Judd Apatow. the key for me is that i want to fall off my chair laughing and this simply did not happen. i was of the impression i was going to witness comedy in the vain of 40 year old virgin or anchorman, and it certainly started this way, but all of sudden became some Jennifer Anniston style chick flick about feeling and emotion. now I'm not criticising chick flicks, each to there own, but if your gonna drag this much emotion in a film, then its probably not appropriate to throw on so much crude humour. the most uncomfortable scene is the birth scene where the good person inside of you is happy for the couple that are about to have this baby against all odds and then we are subjected to a dilated vagina. i did not laugh at this. i did not laugh at this at all. normally i would but because this movie doesn't know what it is supposed to be, it was just cringe worthy.<br/><br/>i was irritated by the subplot of Debbie and Pete and their marriage which is as far as I'm concerned was an excuse to put Mr apatow's wife and kids in the movie. the always excellent Paul Rudd tried his best with what he had but was totally wasted as Pete.<br/><br/>i will admit it is definitely funny is some respects ,but didn't deliver enough for me. hell a few bloopers or deleted scenes in the final credits would have at least had me walking out of the cinema with a smile on my face. I'm probably being generous with six stars."

","I believed that Hot Fuzz could not be topped this year, how completely wrong I turned out to be. Now my views on seeing Knocked Up were very mixed at times, despite the brilliant trailer and the great premise one thing still haunted me, and that thing is The 40 Year Old Virgin. Now for saying this I realise I am going to get quite a few peoples backs up, and I admit I am in the very small minority here, but the truth is that I didn't find 40 Year Old Virgin that great. I know shock horror! It was funny, I will give it that, and it helped launch Steve Carrel's career, a fact I am very grateful for, well until I saw Evan Almighty. But I just didn't find it as funny as I hoped and I found it very overrated by a lot of people. As a result of this I was praying that Knocked Up would be a bit different from 40 Year Old Virgin, or at least that I'd find it as good as the critics had made it out to be. Thankfully I did! I spent two hours last night in absolute hysterics because of how funny this movie turned out to be, and it was so funny that I am seeing it yet again tonight! The movie is funny and sweet blended together perfectly, the sentimentality factor does kick in eventually, but I didn't have a problem with it because it was executed so well. The cast is pitch perfect and hopefully this will launch Seth Rogen's career as 40 Year Old Virgin did for Steve Carrel.<br/><br/>As I just said the cast of Knocked Up are absolutely perfect. Seth Rogen proves to be a great comedian in this movie and he's actually playing a believable character. Things he does and says are actually very believable, sure he comes across as a bumbling idiot at times, but in truth all he wants is fun out of life. Katherine Heigl does an equally as brilliant job as the lady who is Knocked Up, her character does seem a bit bitchy as the hormones kick in, but it was interesting for me to watch this as I went with another boy and two girls. Us two guys sat there and related completely to Ben, the girls on the other hand seemed to be more on the side of Alison. It was interesting as it obviously worked just as well for them as it did for us. The performances just seem very honest, and both characters, no matter how messed up their lives seem to become, both seem likable. When it comes to the sentimental scenes the performances make them work because the scenes seem sweeter than your average movie like this. But despite all my praise for these two the movie in my eyes belonged to one man, Paul Rudd. He gets all the best lines, well not all most of them. He features in most of the best scenes, most namely a magic mushroom sequences in Vegas that had me crying with laughter and a later one involving chairs that had me crying once again. His character once again is believable and his relationship with his slightly scary psychotic wife, played brilliantly by Leslie Mann, once again believable. All the supporting cast work well as well. I have to give a special mention to Jonah Hill who is hilarious in a later hospital sequence in the movie, and we will next be seeing in the brilliant looking Superbad, brought to us from the people who made Knocked Up!<br/><br/>The comedy side of the movie is what makes this quite possibly the most brilliant movie of the year. Now 40 Year Old Virgin in my eyes relied for the most part on sex gags and Steve Carrel, which is understandable given the nature of its plot. However, after a while I found it all a little bit boring. Here while we get a hell of a lot of sex gags, all of which are superb, there are also a lot more of the smaller kind of jokes that are hilarious as well. This nice balance, as well as the balance with the more dramatic side, make this movie as great as it is. The Vegas sequence has to be my favourite scene from a movie this year, and there are a large variety of jokes to be found. One of my personal favourites involves the mis-spelling of coming which once again had me crying with laughter. The sequence where the couple meet and ""do the deed"" is also very well done and hilarious. The movie is just full of so many jokes that its impossible to pick up on them all in just one sitting, I guarantee you will laugh for the majority of this movie.<br/><br/>So any faults? Some might question the length, hell I know I did when I saw it was a two hour running time before I went in. But surprisingly, for two hours this went very quick. This is unusual as in my eyes a two hour running time for a comedy is pretty much the death sentence for it. Fortunately the storyline works and the characters work so well that you don't care how long this is. This is the perfect date movie to be honest, it has the gags and humour for the guys, but the nice smaller romance stuff for the girls. It blends perfectly for a movie that is aimed at both sexes. In a year that I thought Bourne Ultimatum could not be topped as King of 2007, a small American comedy comes along and knocks it off its perch. This is a superb comedy here and I cannot wait to see it many times in the future."

"hunk-of-monk","8","0","2","29 August 2007"," the world is waiting for Apatow and co. to fail, but they will have to wait a little longer.
","Knocked Up, the new movie from 40 Year Old Virgin co writer Judd Apatow and first time leading male Seth Rogen has received many plaudits in recent months, and therefore, many will be cynical upon entering. But they needn't be, because Knocked Up is a hilarious, emotive and sharply written romantic comedy that manages to avoid all the overwrought clichÃ©s of the genre by introducing the spanner in the works of an unexpected pregnancy to the newly acquainted couples lives. Firstly, Knocked Up is hysterical. Apatow's willingness to let his actors improvise gives the dialogue a sense of realism, the punch lines are numerous, unrelenting, and the sub plots of Ben's house mates and Pete and Debbie's marriage ensure the laughs are ever present. However, what justifies the hyperbole surrounding this seemingly average comedy is the storyline. During Knocked Up, the viewer is never left with the feeling that, (unlike Dodgeball, Wedding Crashers or Talladega Knights) the story is superfluous to the jokes, simply a platform for a group of predetermined one liners. Put simply, if you removed the jokes from Knocked Up, there would still be a worthwhile movie, one with themes of accepting the ones we love for who they are, maturing to provide a role model for our children, loss of youth, how random and insignificant events can change our life ""plans"", and the ugliness women feel during pregnancy. This is not to say Knocked Up is a perfect film, occasionally characters or sub plots are introduced too quickly, so that jokes don't have the full impact, or characters actions seem irrational (for example Pete's sneaking out on Debbie, we knew they were arguing but not really why, a simple scene showing them arguing would have been helpful). But this is understandable, seeing as though Knocked Up is a long film for a comedy, which is not a criticism, there is never a moment in the film that the viewer is bored, but at 124 minutes, it is easy to see how Apatow would have been stretched to find time to fit in these scenes. This, though, is simply nit picking in a film that successfully manages to bridge the gap between gross out teen flick and mature, bitter sweet romantic comedy. A film, which contains more laughs, a better storyline, and a sweeter relationship between its lead couple than the more anticipated comedy of the summer, the Simpsons Movie."
"agmoldham","6","0","2","28 August 2007"," An intelligent rom com
","Ben is an unemployed guy living off a windfall he received some years earlier. He hangs around with other guys that have a similar outlook in life and enjoy watching porn, drinking beer and smoking pot. Alison is employed by a cable TV company and is just about to make her big break in front of the camera. The chances of these two guys hitting it off are equivalent to the chances of me hitting it off with Liv Tyler. Once the beer goggles are on though anything is possible and a one night stand turns out to have far greater consequences than it should do. The normal flow of a relationship is turned on it's head as the couple have a baby on the way before they know anything about one another. The film follows the development of this unusual relationship.<br/><br/>Before seeing the film I expected it to be a bit in the mould of a Farrelly brothers production, but I've got to say the humour is considerably more subtle. Rogan and Heigl are excellent in the lead roles and I think the film is in the same league as ""When Harry Met Sally"". It is certainly nice to see a Rom Com with something new to say. It probably wouldn't lose a lot on the small screen, so if you miss it on the cinema check it out at home."
"houndtang75","7","0","3","28 August 2007"," A bit disappointing...
","Having loved 'Anchorman' and 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' I was really looking forward to 'Knocked Up', but it didn't deliver in the same way those two did. That's not to say it's a bad film, just nothing exceptional. It has some good laughs and funny performances but could have done with a bit of script-editing. There was also no chemistry between Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl which made their decision to stay together seem a bit implausible, unlike the well-played relationship between Steve Carell and Catherine Keener in '40 Year Old Virgin'. Ben's instant transformation from slobby flatmate to job and spacious apartment was all a bit unlikely also. All in all a nice enough movie but don't expect a classic."
"barrys82","9","0","1","26 August 2007"," Entertaining, enjoyable, Intelligent
","Before the beginning of the movie I thought that this was going to be another meaningless, corny chick flick. But I was wrong, first of all its not the typical romantic comedy, also although it has tons of sexual and scatological humor, it isn't entirely based by this. Its in fact a very intelligent and original comedy movie with a very decent and convincing plot and a story with a very strong message. The film is about a woman that wants to be a E! Entertainment Television hostess, but her dream gets derailed when in a drunken one-night she gets pregnant from a guy with no future and her life changes drastically, additionally we have a secondary story where Allison's sister and his husband are trying to save their marriage. It has some very funny moments, like the scene where Ben goes to Las Vegas, eats some mushrooms, went to see the Cirque Du Soleil show and began to hallucinate. It also has some very good drama scenes. A very good acting from everyone from the cast, Katherine Heigl besides looking beautiful, delivers us a great performance, Seth Rogen is so hilarious in his role as Ben Stone, he is a really good comedian. The secondary roles of Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd gives the necessary support to Heigl and Rogen. To conclude, this is a entertaining and enjoyable movie with the purpose of making conscience of how important is to have safe sex for not to have unwanted pregnancies and with the message that you can find love where you least expect it"

"MaxBorg89","8","0","2","17 August 2007"," A surprisingly effective mix of sweetness and crudity
","On paper, Knocked Up didn't sound like a great project. The finished product, on the other hand, manages, similarly to director Judd Apatow's previous film, The 40-Year Old Virgin, to transcend its puerile concept and become a comedy that entertains and moves in equal measure.<br/><br/>The leading role is played by Seth Rogen, who famously said to Steve Carell (who appears as himself in a very irreverent, amusing scene) in Virgin: ""I am ugly as f*ck by traditional standards, but, I get with women."". His character in Knocked Up, Ben Stone, might agree with the first part of the statement, but certainly not with the second: in fact, he's been so obsessed with fulfilling his dream (he and his pals are working on a website which can tell you exactly at what point and for how long a famous actor or actress is naked in a movie) he hasn't even seen a woman in ages. Imagine his surprise, then, when he goes out for a drink and runs into Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a TV camerawoman who is about to get a promotion, and she accepts to spend the night with him. Only problem is, Ben's excessive eagerness leads him to misinterpret his partner's instructions about a condom, meaning that eight weeks later he gets a phone call from Alison who is in the titular condition and forces him to face his responsibilities.<br/><br/>So far, so typical. But just like Kevin Smith, Apatow has a rare gift: he can alternate moments of pure crudity and reflections on deeper subjects without making the picture seem uneven. For every scene where Ben and his friends discuss things using extremely colorful expressions, there is a touching glimpse of the crisis that is going on between Alison's sister, played by the director's real-life wife Leslie Mann, and brother-in-law (Paul Rudd), whose bleak description of his feelings is worthy of Woody Allen: ""Marriage is like a tense, unfunny version of Everybody Loves Raymond, only it doesn't last 22 minutes. It lasts forever."". Beyond the American Pie-style premise (albeit a more realistic one than that of Virgin) lies a daring, but also very funny, analysis of love, commitment, aging and the fear of remaining alone. Not bad for a filmmaker whose breakthrough feature had a tag-line that said ""The longer you wait, the harder it gets"" (Knocked Up's is even cheekier: ""A one-night stand to end all others"").<br/><br/>As with The 40-Year Old Virgin, much of the fun derives from the cast: though it is unlikely he will be cast in more serious or mature roles, as was the case with Carell (Little Miss Sunshine), Rogen is a valuable addition to the new wave of emerging American comedians; Rudd develops the darker side he started showing in Virgin, confirming his status as a reliable dramatic counterpoint to the slapstick in Apatow's films, and his chemistry with Mann adds to their scenes' poignancy; and Heigl, best known for Grey's Anatomy, could easily become the new Cameron Diaz, using her looks but not depending on them (something that was actually discussed in an episode of Grey's) and proving, much more effectively than Reese Witherspoon, that not all blondes necessarily have to be stupid on camera, her performance being one of the smartest ever given by a female lead in a mainstream comedy.<br/><br/>Ironically, the movie's only weakness is also shared with its predecessor: the running time. The film is never actually boring, but 129 minutes is a little too much even for something as funny as this, and there are a few scenes (the Vegas bit and the celebrity cameo montage most of all) that would have been better had they been shortened a bit. Overall, though, Knocked Up is the year's best US comedy so far, and further confirmation of the fact that Judd Apatow is a name that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Mel Brooks or Kevin Smith."

"tnrcooper","10","0","7","16 July 2007"," Deserves Oscar for best movie...or at least most enjoyable
","This is a very very very funny film. I really can't say how funny it was. I'd have to include about 18 ""very""s which, as Ace Ventura said about three poisoned arrows, is ""too many"". Director and writer Judd Apatow has a unique and welcome take on comedy. He does not attempt to hew out its coarseness. All the sometimes gratuitous profanity which one might typically encounter in the course of a day is included in the movie and Apatow does not shy away from supposedly taboo or off-color topics. In so doing, Apatow and his talented cast have again struck a chord with people who appreciate the everyday nature of his movies.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is quite simple. An unlikely couple, after a little too much fun out, has sex and the woman becomes pregnant and the couple, the charming and beautiful Katherine Heigl as up-and-coming TV producer/host Alison Scott and the beefy and very funny writer/director Seth Rogen as laid-back stoner Ben Stone have to decide how they will proceed. First of all, will the child be aborted? Will Stone be involved in the child's upbringing? Will the couple marry? Will they stay together? This classic challenge makes for a rich vein of humor which Apatow mines very well. Apatow does not sugarcoat or mislead about the very real challenges facing this unlikely couple. But his characters seem so plausible and have such airs of reality about them that the challenges they encounter do not seem unreasonable. As said, his two co-stars are very talented. <br/><br/>The one reservation I had about the plausibility of the film was the difference in their appearances. To be quite blunt, Alison is gorgeous and Ben is quite pedestrian looking. Of course, the reasons for which they were together tend to minimize the importance of that difference, but still and all, if couples who look so unconventional do exist, I have not seen them. That said, Heigl is very likable and one roots for her and Rogen delivers in spades on the promise of his one-liners and throwaway digs as one of Steve Carell's co-workers in The ""40 Year Old Virgin"". He improvises much of his work here, as do many of the actors. Rogen has an inventive comic mind which he used to help Sascha Baron Cohen work on ""Da Ali G Show"" and his quick mind is quite evident in this movie. Some of the best scenes are loosely written frameworks of scenes in which Ben and his goofy friends sit around and riff, in addition to scenes including both Rogen and Paul Rudd who is also clearly in his element improvising comedy. There are some other excellent performances, most notably Leslie Mann (Apatow's wife), as Alison's somewhat neurotic and insecure but protective older sister Debbie In particular, Jason Segel as perhaps the slickest of Ben's friends, Jason, a guy who is very smooth with the ladies in spite of his pedestrian looks. As mentioned, Rudd, as Debbie's music scout husband is also very, very good and seems to have developed a good collaborative relationship with Apatow, having worked with him on his last two movies.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see the success of future Apatow projects given his obvious abilities and accomplishments thus far and it will be an enjoyable anticipation."

Judd Apatow, knows how to deliver on the hard core laughs and the hear touching moments from beginning to end. Seth Rogen's Ben is every 20 year olds coolest friend. You laugh at his demeanor, his jokes, his all out goofiness, even if it is a little immature at times, but who hasn't been immature? Judd did such a fantastic job crafting and molding these characters that you sit back in amazement and awww while taking the 2 hour journey.<br/><br/>The true star of this flick is definitely Seth, although Katherine had me rooting for her through the whole film. When her emotions kicked in and her hormones went crazy you felt her pain, you felt her feelings and when Seth realized he might be going down the wrong path you are right there on that journey.<br/><br/>The best comedic timing is definitely between Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen, but a shining star is also well placed in this film. Jonah Hill is given one of the best comedic lines and he handles it with pure ease. Seeing him do his thing has me excited for his upcoming ""Super Bad"" film which is going to be released this fall.<br/><br/>One great thing I have to say is Judd's knack for assembling terrific actors for his films. His rag tag crew in 40 year old virgin was fantastic and here again he struts his stuff putting together a great cast who get to work with grade A material.<br/><br/>Knocked Up is a fantastic Romantic Coming of Age comedy that delivers on all levels from beginning to end.

","I went to see an advanced screening of 'Knocked Up' about a week before it opened across all of the cinemas. I must say that I was quite impressed with the film overall. WIth my new system of rating movies, I wish to rate this movie:<br/><br/>Plot: 8/10 = Pregnancy is not a topic that is frequently featured in films in this day and age, either as the main plot device or just in a sub story, and I was impressed to see that such a subjective and life changing subject was present on the screen. The scenario of that fateful night between Ben (Seth Rogen) and that chick from 'Gray's Anatomy' (sorry I forgot her name :P) was very well written and should be commended.<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10 = I rate this element very highly. All of the characters contributed greatly and the acting did not flounder once throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>Dialogue: 10/10 = Pure genius. Whoever came up with the lines is a pure genius. The script flowed surprisingly well with the plot. The pop culture references in addition to various perks, including Paul Rudd's hilarious facial expression of Robert De Niro was totally classy. <br/><br/>Cinematography: 7 = Not bad. The main settings were just the houses that they lived in, but it showed the varying lifestyles of the two main characters.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: 7 = I enjoyed most of the songs during the film. Although it would have been nice to have a very loud track during the labour scene :(<br/><br/>Mean Score - 8.2 Overall Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>An impressive movie which exceeded my expectations. It is definitely worth a look. My girlfriend and I were in hysterics."
"shiftyeyeddog","8","0","2","5 July 2007"," A dream cast of the new generation of comedy
","Comedy has basically fallen into three categories these days. There's the family friendly light comedies such as any of the crap Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy have done in the past 10 years, there's the moronic comedies with people like Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider, and there's the gross-out comedies. That's why it's so refreshing when a comedy comes along that is geared for adults. 40 Year-Old Virgin was a great recent example, and now the same team has returned with another success, Knocked Up.<br/><br/>Based on the subject matter, language, and content, it's definitely for adults, but it doesn't need to resort to gross-outs for cheap laughs. The film has some real laugh-out-loud moments and is consistently entertaining for all of its two-hour-plus running time. While the second hour doesn't quite live up to the first, as it started to remind me more of Nine Months than 40 year-Old Virgin - not just the subject, but its tone and plot as well - it was still thoroughly entertaining. It manages to be be funny in all the right (and wrong) ways, but still ends up being a sweet film with real heart.<br/><br/>The one thing that really makes the film work is the cast. Heck, even Ryan Seacrest made me laugh in his one scene. The group assembled here is like a dream team of the new generation of comedy - all very new up-and-coming talents (with the exception of Paul Rudd, who is only recently getting the attention and acclaim he deserves): Seth Rogen, Rudd, Jason Segal, Jonah Hill, Alan Tudyk, Kristen Wiig & Bill Hader (the only actually talented members of SNL these days), and several others from director Apatow's Freaks & Geeks and Undeclared. As a matter of fact, you could pretty much play the ""One Degree of Judd Apatow"" game with the whole cast. Practically everyone from the two fore-mentioned shows makes an appearance, as well as people from 40 Year-Old Virgin, and even the director's own wife and kids play substantial supporting roles in the film.<br/><br/>I really hope this group continues to churn out more films, as they are far superior to the ""frat pack"" that seems to be considered the top of comedy right now - Ben Stiller, the Wilson brothers, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn (though I like some of his stuff)... I know I'll be waiting to see whatever they choose to do next."
"ingres77","7","0","3","4 July 2007"," Proof that a movie can both be good and formulaic.
","We've all seen this movie before. Poor schlub meets beautiful woman, they fall in love and live happily ever after. This story is the inevitable fantasy for normal guys, duplicated countless times in other, less interesting films. It fails more often than it succeeds, but when it does succeed, it virtually guarantees that people will pay to see the film. <br/><br/>Movies work best as a mirror. We all want to see ourselves reflected back off that screen. Whether that be a world we recognize, or characters we identify with. We need to see ourselves up there on the screen. That's what these kinds of stories do. They tell us, the normal looking guys who make up the percentage of the male population, that we can get a girl that looks like this. Granted, we wouldn't like to do it under these circumstances, but still. The point is there.<br/><br/>So it's no surprise that movies keep getting made with this premise. But it doesn't explain why this particular movie is good.<br/><br/>This movie has all the familiar parts. The four act story: boy meets girl, boy and girl get together, boy and girl fight, boy and girl reunite. It has the pretty girl (Katherine Heigl) and the ""average guy"" (Seth Rogan). And the two do work it out in the end.<br/><br/>Therein lies probably the biggest complaint. Why would a girl like Heigl be interested in a guy like Rogan? Other than the baby, that would never happen in real life. Or so they want us to believe. In all probability, it wouldn't happen in real life. But that's not the point. The point, here, is to create the fantasy that it could happen. You can dissect the fantasy of any movie and poke holes in the premise. But, in so doing, you are destroying the very point the film is trying to make. <br/><br/>Regardless, as in Apatow's previous film, Knocked Up rises above it's peers because of the great casting and intelligent script. For what it lacks in originality, it more than makes up for with it's honest depiction of it's characters and good ear for dialogue. The easy camaraderie of Ben (Seth Rogan) and his friends give this film a relaxed and familiar quality that most films of this kind don't have.<br/><br/>Instead of being boring and forced, this movie is fun and light. It realizes that it's just a comedy, and doesn't strive for anything more than that. The dramatic parts don't try too hard to be dramatic, and the funny parts don't try too hard to be funny. The laughs are plenty, and you generally feel something for the characters, but there's nothing exploitive or generic here.<br/><br/>In spite of all that, I don't know if this movie is for everyone. The humor is crude, because the main characters (Ben Stone and his friends) are crude. They spend their time smoking pot and perusing movies for nudity. Their friendship is decidedly juvenile, but in an affectionate way. I think any young man can identify with their interaction, and the average young woman will roll her eyes at the puerile nature of these guys, and how they remind her of men she's known in her life.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is the story of a young, immature man who's forced to grow up. This point isn't driven home too hard, but it is allowed to exist within the framework of the overall film. While the end result of this movie is to make you laugh, there is more than enough character development and intelligence to make this film standout from typical, similar, Hollywood fare.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth a look."
"puffball97","8","0","2","3 July 2007"," A Knockout! One of the Summer's Best
","Director Judd Apatow knows how to get the audience's attention with sexual titles such as ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and this movie, ""Knocked Up!"" He specializes in raunchy, foul-mouthed comedies that don't resort to external gross-out humor a la ""There's Something About Mary"" or ""Wedding Crashers"" with talented frat packers like Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson. Right now on my mind, speaking of such, how about a movie getting back Stiller with Cameron Diaz and she gets to work with Wilson, someone she never worked with yet. These two guys could play men in love with her, fighting over her, with uproarious results. Wouldn't that be a riot?<br/><br/>But getting back to Apatow and his own style of comedy, he has a wonderful troupe of sarcastic actors - Seth Rogen, his real-life wife, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, to name a few - lending a hand to the leading lady, Katherine Heigl of ""Grey's Anatomy"" fame. And like ""Virgin,"" the themes are love, sex, family, and laughing with groups of good friends, something we can all relate to.<br/><br/>The title tells all - Two yuppies - Rogen, an internet nerd accompanied by his buddies, and Heigl, a promoted TV network reporter accompanied with her older married sister Mann, meet in a bar, and without thinking about it, have a one-night stand. Both agree to keep the baby and become devoted parents. They are confused about how to maintain the relationship, and in some parts, are not so sure whether they want to stay together. But all works out, and baby is born. Watch for hilarious cameos by Joanna Kerns as Heigl's Mom and legendary funnyman Harold Ramis as Rogen's Dad. <br/><br/>This is a fresh summer movie where the audience laughs themselves silly. You can laugh so hard you won't be able to hear the lines. This is my blurb - Get Knocked Out at Knocked Up!"

"sullibrandon","8","0","2","28 June 2007"," A Heartwarming Film
","Judd Apatow is unequivocally a genius. While traditionally R-rated comedies mean something demeaning, raunchy, and lacking any real redeeming value, such as American Pie, Eurotrip, and Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, Apatow has managed to elevate the genre to something approaching art. I haven't actually seen the TV show ""Freaks and Geeks"", but it is universally critically acclaimed and everyone bemoans that it was cancelled, another great show lost in the annals of screwed up TV bureaucracy (Firefly, anyone?). But I did see The 40-Year-Old Virgin, a movie from which I was not expecting much (I had never heard of Apatow before), but which I came out of marveling at how incredibly smart it was and what wonderful performances the cast gave. Here was an R-rated comedy that was plenty raunchy but still managed to have something smart and true to say. Knocked Up is no different - Apatow is two for two now with this wonderful story that celebrates and embraces the differences between men and women while giving us true-to-life view on adult relationships.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a practically broke pothead who is trying to make money through a website that catalogues films that contain nude scenes of actors and actress. Katherine Heigl is Alison Scott, an up and coming TV reporter who works at E! and gets promoted. On one side, a loser pothead. On the other, a successful drop-dead gorgeous young woman. On the day of her promotion Scott decides to go out and party with Debbie, played by the director's wife Leslie Mann, who is married to a Pete, played by Paul Rudd. The two women are having fun until of course they meet Stone and his pothead buddies. Stone and Scott hook up for a night of a wild sex, but unfortunately they don't use a condom. Eight weeks later, Scott finds out she is pregnant, and together the two decide to work things out.<br/><br/>In a scenario as unlikely as a gorgeous blonde hooking up with a rather unattractive and unemployed stoner, the story would suck if the characters were anything but lovable and believable, and fortunately ever single one of them is both. Ben's pothead roommates border on the simply conventional and unrealistic, but I think it's okay that they're just there for comic relief, and they serve to show the kind of lifestyle that Ben leads and how important his pals are to him. Ben himself is true to life and he is played perfectly by Seth Rogen. Katherine Heigl isn't as good, but she still shares some great chemistry with Rogen. Two characters that almost steal the show, though, are Pete and Debbie, who serve as an example to both Ben and Alison about what marriage is like in real life. True, the characters are caricatured a bit, but this is the case in any movie, and I thought both Rudd and Mann had perfect marriage chemistry together and the struggles within their marriage showed admirably well the difference between men and women, which brings me to the best thing about Knocked Up.<br/><br/>The mature view of adult relationships, the celebration of the difference between men and women, and the importance of taking responsibility and growing up are all themes that are well and competently explored in Knocked Up. Alison and Ben's relationship works because this is how it would look if it happened in real life. The two are deathly afraid of how Pete and Debbie's marriage looks like from the outside because of how much they fight, and the observations that they each have about the marriage are surprisingly accurate to what a given man or a given woman may observe in those situations. Many people complained about how unrealistic the two's love is, but this is a movie people, and it's not meant to portray real life. Besides, I easily understood what Alison sees in Ben - he's a sweet guy deep inside, and I could tell that he really cared for Alison. Like I said before, the chemistry between the two is wonderful, heartwarming, and endearing.<br/><br/>On the whole Knocked Up is a great film. The characters are excellent, the humor uses real life situations and real people for laughs, the raunchiness is not excessive, but perfectly fits the film. Every single one of the cameos is excellent, from Steve Carell all the way to Kristen Wiig, with whom I was particularly impressed. She's only in two scenes, but her comedic timing and delivery in both of those scenes was so perfectly executed that she effortlessly stole both of them. I did not enjoy Knocked Up as much as I did 40-Year-Old Virgin, partly because 40 had the amazing Steve Carell, partly because it bothered me that one of the final revelations of the film comes about because of mind-altering substances (not pot, but something else). I almost felt cheated, but I was quickly carried away from that feeling when I got sucked back into the story. If it weren't for the R rating, this would almost be a wonderful family film - it's that good. Sweet, excellent, heartwarming, and charming, Knocked Up has me looking forward to Judd Apatow's next project all the more."

","Obviously inspired at least in part by the hit Indian comedy Salaam Namaste, but taken to the limits of bad taste that only an American comedy can. This is better-acted and has a better portrayal of the dynamics of a married couple in crisis and some genuinely funny moments. Rather than just focus on the challenges faced in the relationship between Alison and Ben, it also gives a well-written insight into the interplay between individuals in a relationship that has matured, but the individuals within it are not fulfilled. A couple of the dialogues between Debbie and Pete are absolutely classic. Ben's friends provided some additional comic relief and its good to see that the likes of James Franco haven't forgotten their roots. However, I'm not so sure that it merits being listed in the top 250 movies of all time though."

","It's a beautiful moment when a 14 year old can sit can watch a movie like this with his 51 year old mother and have the two of us laughing our asses off. These twenty year old's show the kind of behavior seen in my school, but it shows that boys can be men too. Suddenly Alice Cooper's ""I'm Eighteen"" makes sense. I myself didn't care for the 40 Year Old Virgin. I thought it was just kind of bland and didn't have the charm that was expected. But ""Knocked Up"" struck gold with me. I was cracking up constantly for the first half of it, and though the laughs died down a bit in the middle, I was still entranced by it and stayed that for the remainder of the film. What's interesting is how Apatow took such an unoriginal plot line and just made it shine (hey that rhymed). This is a movie that will truly lift your spirits regardless of whether you buy your ticket as a student or a senior. This is one of the best comedies to come out in a long time. A fable of modern immaturity."

","I liked the movie, but I had to take two naproxen and two tylenol tabs after--it gave me such a headache. Some scenes were a bit much, e.g. the woman OB/GYN comment about mistaking the vagina for an asshole. Simply not needed. I think the movie would have been much better with a little more humor, and less bickering and dumb comments like the one above. It was a little hard to suspend judgment about a cute girl getting involved with someone outside her ""cutegory."" I also thought that the Jill character was initially developed as a little too mean to be redeemed later. Cut 30 minutes and the unneeded lines from the movie, add a little more humor, and you've got a 10."
"bgordon1234","8","0","2","25 June 2007"," A funny film based primarily on poignant conversations (no sex)
","I went and saw this film with my girlfriend and we both laughed out loud at various moments. It's the writing that makes this film as funny as it is. Apatow has a real knack for understanding the trials and tribulations couples go through and brings it out of his characters. This film is not really a sex comedy. You'd think in a sex comedy there would be ""sex"" but Apatow includes little or no sex at all in this film. The one moment of sex between the two main characters and we see them essentially clothed. I'm sorry but if I were drunk, the clothes would come off no matter WHAT! Apatow is clever because he makes this film an R rated film primarily due to the use of the ubiquitous F word which is uttered in almost every scene. One would assume that a sex comedy would actually have as much sex as it would language. But not here. And I'm somewhat irked by that to tell you the truth. I like having sex and I like watching sex on screen. In a sex comedy I want there to be SEX! But Apatow won't have it mainly because Heigl refused to go nude at any point in the film. Here's this blond knockout of an actress with gorgeous tits and she won't show them. Now that's tragic for a sex comedy! There was more nudity in American Pie (and we got to see the tits of Shannon Elizabeth!!)In the end, this film is cute and consists of poignant conversations about the difficulties of marriage and the challenges monogomy poses to any couple. A few weak spots: - How is it that Seth Rogen suddenly becomes hired at a Web company?? Never really explained or hinted at since previously he's hanging around nothing but stones who have no skill sets imaginable other than smoking pot.<br/><br/><ul><li>Heigl is in LA and hosting E Network. Don't tell me she wouldn't have considered having an abortion!! The fact that Apatow doesn't once force Heigl's character to seriously consider having one was not realistic at all! Not while living and working in plastic Los Angeles! - When drunk, the clothes come off! I don't believe this BS about women who will keep their brazier on while having sex. Plenty of pretty, blond Hollywood actresses that would have shown their T-ts who could have replaced Heigl in a heartbeat.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Finally, I actually do not believe it to be credible that both characters would choose to remain together at the end of this film. Not in plastic LA. The real ending of this story would have been Heigl getting an abortion and that's it. But then you wouldn't have Apatow's movie which did have some good laughs in it.</li></ul>"

They didn't have to make him quite so stupid AND mean; I wanted to like him more than I did, but by the time we neared the end of the movie, the character had burned too many bridges in my book. His character did not consider any information sacred or off-limits and used anything in his arsenal that he wanted to use when he felt like he needed it. Kudos to Ms. Heigl's acting and her character, Allison. I think she was much more tolerant, patient, and forgiving that the average person.

Ben (Seth Rogen, a breakout), a jobless slob, gets Allison (Katharine Heigl), a corporate ladder-climber, preggy. Hilarity ensues, as does thought, heart, and beauty. If you look through the maze of sex scenes and F-bombs, there are actually lessons to be learned from this film.

","Unlike the 40 year old virgin Steve Carell wasn't here to carry this movie however Seth Rogen proved he was up to the task. After seeing Seth lay it down as his role as Cal in the 40 year old virgin I knew he was going to be the next comedy icon, Knocked up is his next step closer. The same genre, style and cast as the 40 year old virgin but just a touch more romance. Barely a 'Blockbuster' but definitely a night at home with the mates and a couple of beers to wash down the popcorn. This crew and team of actors are really raising the bar when it comes to American comedy. It was great to see the slapstick comedy of Will Ferrell falling over for the 12th time in a film for a cheap laugh back in 2001 but I say 'Out with the old in with the new' new being Seth Rogen.

Not to mention the little scenes where the guys are playing American Gladiator Games near a nasty,moldy pool and the scenes where they are pretty baked talking about stupid stuff. The girls obviously had something to relate to because I am sure there has been many a time where they think about a certain guy and whether or not they would stick it out with him , while getting unhelpful comments from their girlfriends or family.

","Knocked Up is very much like it's predecessors 40 Year Old Virgin and Anchor Man, it is a new comedy with a unique style in sense of humor and plot development. A very important part of this movie being satisfying and above all VERY funny, is that it is not your classic ""girl gets hit in the face"" ""rob Schneider falls everywhere"" ""Eddie Murphy gets put in bad situation"" etc, it's NEW and it's unique in it's style. While being such a clever comedy with numerous pop culture references and intelligent humor, Knocked Up also boasts a fantastic storyline and pacing, with GOOD actors. Each and every character in Knocked Up is very believable, some of the best acting I have seen this year for sure.<br/><br/>Not to mention, the soundtrack is clean as well. The vast amount of stoner humor is definitely a plus all in it's own just because if you smoke weed, you will automatically extremely relate to Ben's roommates in the movie. The settings and costumes are very realistic and nice to the eyes as well. The clothing and styles of the characters definitely caught my attention as being very thought out and smooth. But, my favorite theme of this movie was probably the fact that the ""hero"" of the story, Ben, is not your typical good-looking, I-can-handle-anything persona, he is just like you and I: a complete underdog and a complete nerd.<br/><br/>Cheers for Knocked Up breaking the slapstick comedy trend that has plagued modern cinema. I hope to see more movies from this wonderful director. This is a very realistic movie which I think made it so appealing to me, I feel like I have met many of the characters in real life - thats how good they are! GO see this NOW! If you smoke weed, I suggest blazing beforehand. NOW GO!"

It wasn't as much of a laugh-fest as his previous shows, and I've been told its cause I'm not a young man. If you are just after laughs I would point you in the direction of 'The 40-year old Virgin' before this.<br/><br/>But I did appreciate it. I don't think its as implausible as some people here think that a smart, gorgeous career oriented woman could fall for a 'chubby loser'. Yes, the character of Ben is a complete pot-head, porno obsessed idiot at times, but his heart is in the right place and he assumes responsibility when its needed. And Seth, being a great comedy actor, makes that work - he's a real talent.<br/><br/>So, close - but no cigar."

Rudd's performance was impressive as the wuss of a husband and totally real from an mature adult that had been married for 10 or more years. Very implausible that a single woman would have a baby given her career circumstances. Little foundation given for her decision.

"EtheGreat","9","0","3","17 June 2007"," Funny vulgarity at its best
","This was a really funny movie. First of all let me preface this review by saying that my life and that of the character played by Paul Rudd could be interchangeable. My wife and I went to see it, and we both laughed out loud through the whole thing. Is it hard to believe that this tubby loser could score a squared away hottie like this? Sure it is, but I don't always watch movies for realism. The friends were beyond hilarious, and every scene that they were in was hysterical. It reminded me of what it was like when I was 21 and things were much more simple in the world. Having the ability to be able to lay all responsibilities on the side and enjoy the moment you are in is not such a bad thing in moderation, and the buddy characters really pulled it off. Paul Rudd was so funny that I started wishing that I had a friend just like him about half way through the movie. I knew before I went into this movie how it was going to end. Loser lands babe, then loses her, then transforms his life and gets her back. It is one of the oldest plot lines in the book. Movies do not have to be about the plot. Sometimes they can rely on dialog and characters, which this movie does spectacularly. This is not Casablanca, but I don't think that any of us will mistakenly watch it thinking that it is. My wife and I almost never agree on what is funny, and even in this movie we found that we were often laughing when the other wasn't, but we both laughed....a lot. Sometimes we even laughed at the same parts, which was a nice change of pace. If people in this world are still capable of being honest with themselves, I think that they will agree that this movie is great for what it is: low brow romantic comedy, light on the romance, heavy on the low brow. I highly recommend it, and might even consider watching it again myself in the theaters, which would be the first repeat movie viewing I have had since the first Lord of the Rings movie."

But he didn't sing it the way Kevin did. The movie 'French Kiss' was very sweet and I love Meg Ryan, she is always great, my ex almost ran her down in Manhattan with some piping, and she laughed. My main contribution to this, is the talent and the variation on the song mentioned above. Please rent it if only to hear Kevin sing Cynthia"

","This is the funniest movie I have ever seen! At first, when I saw the previews, I thought it was a dumb concept for a movie and figured I might as well see it. I came out of that theater with tears from all the laughs in it, I definitely recommend this movie! Every aspect of this movie was funny especially the character Jodi. She was awkward, but hilarious all at the same time. And Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are the best on screen pair I have seen in a long time. They worked great together and made the movie much more enjoyable. And the pairing of Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd, and how they become best friends, is so funny since they contrast one another."
"lmitrani","7","0","2","15 June 2007"," Remarkably entertaining despite Stretching Credibility
","Although the film was enjoyable and lived up to the critical praise it received, there was one major premise that rang false. <br/><br/>The story in a nutshell is that Alison (Katherine Heigl), a TV reporter, meets unemployed Ben (Seth Rogen) in a local bar, becomes pregnant from him that same night, and spends the rest of the movie coping with her predicament and the relationship. There are several funny incidents involving her gynecologists, her sister, and their adventures trying to enter an exclusive club. <br/><br/>What was not at all credible was that Alison would have pursued any kind of ongoing relationship with Ben in the real world. Alison was a very attractive woman who probably could have dated anyone, and could hardly go anywhere without being hit upon. Ben was just the opposite: unattractive, overweight, with no money, no job, no career prospects, and friends who were a bunch of losers. When she learned she was pregnant, I couldn't believe she would call him about it, since she otherwise had little interest in him. She certainly did not need him for his breadwinner's role, and she showed little chemistry for him other than their impending parenthood. However, I might concede that the one-night stand itself may have been plausible because they were drunk.<br/><br/>This was one of the very few movie couples I rooted against and hoped that their relationship would collapse; I won't spoil the outcome for you. The other couple in the film -- Alison's sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) Â– was very likable, credible and worthy of my support.<br/><br/>There were also incidents in the movie like the trip to a Vegas strip club and dinner at expensive restaurants that I did not see how Ben paid for with his meager bank balance.<br/><br/>If you can overlook what I consider these major stumbling blocks of credibility, then the film was fine. I, however, could not ignore them. The other characters in the movie like Alison's sister and brother-in-law, the club bouncer and Ben's buddies were sharply drawn and highly believable. The pacing and music were good compliments to the story."

","Considering that I have watched 40 Year Old Virgin 20+ times, I had great expectations for this movie. Well, I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it was funny. The story line was good...and is definitely relevant to a lot of people. The humor was hit or miss, but the good one-liners and expressions were well above average. The problem...language. A good f-bomb or two can be dropped into a dialogue and prove to be funny. However, the excessive language was over the top and took away from the story line. I wasn't impressed, and I think it just proves that some producers and directors don't have the ability to deliver a movie that's gut-wrenching funny from beginning to end. I would have been just fine if the language was replaced with some more dramatic dialogue to make it a bit more chick-flickish. I'm not a chick flick kinda guy, but I'll take it if it will add to the story."

I highly recommend this film to all viewers and movie lovers, for a very good time at the movies ""KnockedUp"" delivers it all with a hysterically laughter. Great humor and well written, with the dispute from the characters and the comments toward each, with the characteristics of a stoner/internet geek and a highly classed/career woman who ends up pregnant after having a one night stand with the geek. A great plot. This is a must see film, trust me you want be disappointed."

","Knocked Up is one of the better comedies in the last couple of years. It has humor all throughout the movie and anyone with a good sense of humor will love this movie and maybe even going back to see it again. It's not only a movie you see with the boys one night, but you can take the wife or girlfriend out to see it or maybe even your grandma??. Seth Rogan did a great job throughout the movie and his friends were very funny. I'm a guy, so I loved many of the perverted comical jokes all through the movie which most females that don't have the sense of humor would laugh on. The only negative part of the movie was when they were at the hospital at the end of the movie. Go see it to find out and if you have, you will know what im talking about. Maybe that part was for the shock laugh(the laugh where you say,wtf?haha)Overall great movie and looking forward to buying it when it comes out on DVD."
"raysond","Null","0","7","8 June 2007"," The laugh track of a generation with the most refreshing film of 2007
","Looking at the big names in comedy,its clear that those who do the best work oftentimes serve as the voice of there generations. In the 1960's and 1970's,it was Woody Allen that defined his epoch. And during the 60's and 70's you have also on that same roster great comedical directors like Robert Altman,Blake Edwards,and Mel Brooks. In the 1980's,John Hughes best represented what it meant to be young and dissatisfied in suburban America. During that same decade you have also Amy Heckerling who represented the teenage youth of that time. Also for boarder perspective,you have John Landis and David Zucker. The 90's is a little tougher to pin,but let's go with Nora Ephron the writer/director responsible for three of the most influential comedies of the last 20 years: ""When Harry Met Sally"",""Sleepless In Seattle"",and ""You've Got Mail"". Not to mention others who made their mark in the 90's as well. In this decade of the 2000's we found someone as a voice of our own:Judd Apatow. There's little evidence to suggest he isn't the one man in America that can make everyone laugh.<br/><br/>As a director,he gave us ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"",and some of the best TV shows ever to get the axe(the short-lived TV shows ""Undeclared"",and ""Freaks and Geeks""),and its with that pedigree in mind that one approaches Apatow's latest endeavor ""Knocked Up"" with sky-high expectations as one of the funniest movies ever to come out of 2007. Rest assured because this film is every bit as hilarious as you'd expect. And while it doesn't top ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""-honestly,what could?-it's indicative of maturation in Apatow's style of comedy that is repulsive funny at ever turn. While ""Knocked Up"" is an adult comedy with a youthful spirit and that what's keeps the film,only Apatow's second directorial effect is raw,and persistingly funny. A perfect retreat from the summer norm of tiredless sequels and silly kiddie films. ""Knocked Up"" is a combination of ""When Harry Met Sally"" for a generation raised by the Trojan man mixed in with ever cliché of films dealing with losers trying to score with the town hottie while intoxicated on substances. Apatow has crafted a enjoyable film made with adults in mind because he knows how to relay a love story without overwhelming his audience with sentimentality and this is what makes this film a bonafide winner."
"Robert_duder","9","0","6","5 June 2007"," Knocked Up is an absolute blast!! So slapstick funny and yet one of the most interesting and real human stories
","Knocked Up looked 'funny' right out of the gate. The trailers were hilarious and the fact that the director, writer and producer Judd Apatow surprised the heck out of my last year with ""The Forty Year Old Virgin"" I was really looking forward to this film. I am not a fan of gross out comedy or even gratuitous so called 'adult' comedies, I usually find them childish and annoying but, much like The Forty Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up blew me away!! It's not the fact that it turned out to be roll in the aisles hilarious with an amazingly funny cast, a hilarious script, and moments that just had me busting up but it was the fact that Knocked Up might be one of the most real, and important looks at adult relationships, and men and women that is out there today. This film candidly looks at both sides and completely explores the Men are From Venus, Women are from Mars theory and doesn't offend either side but rather speaks to both sides. Women can sit in this film and nod and say...that is so true and meanwhile their men who were dragged to see Knocked Up (I went more than willingly) are sitting there thinking...that's exactly right...from the guy's perspective. It's a real, important, downright hilarious, touching, cute, funny, dirty, ""F"" bomb dropping drama-fast making it quite possibly one of the greatest films of 2007.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen is a genius. The guy...well he's a guy. I mean that's not to say we're all stoners with no future or job but ultimately he's the every day guy. He plays Ben Stone, an adult who hasn't quite had any reason to leave his immaturity behind. He does what he wants, when he wants with who he wants and he thinks his life is perfect. Rogen is so good because he's just the every day guy. He's almost a loser and yet I think any guy can see something of themselves in him. Plus he's not chiseled, good looking, made up to look like some fake hunk of man. He's a dude. Bravo to him because his rants are hilarious, his romantic moments are well played. His one night stand and sudden romantic partner is played by Katherine Heigl. I love Heigl from Grey's Anatomy and was excited to see her in a big screen role and she does a good job. Unfortunately I don't she does as good a job as some of the other cast members. She comes across as a little plastic at times despite her numerous emotional moments and while she still get some truly funny lines they often come across a little plain and underperformed. Still she does well and her and Rogan have great chemistry which is awesome for this movie. I think I might love Paul Rudd despite his attention to the annoying Will Ferrell comedy troupe as I call them. Rudd's performance as Heigl's brother in law is hilarious, perhaps one of the funniest and most unique performances in the film. His droll, calm demeanor makes every line he has hilarious. Rudd I think is ready for his own film now because he can hold his own. Leslie Mann plays Heigl's sister Debbie. Debbie is long time married, getting older, very sarcastic and bitter about much of her life and that makes her hilarious and serious all in the same breath. She is the perfect balance to Heigl and also to Rudd's performance. The two of them together are the perfect balance to Heigl and Rogan's new relationship. The supporting cast of friends are kind of typical, very crude but insanely funny at the same time and include Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Martin Starr, and Charlyne Yi. They are the crazy friends you might expect for this type of film but times ten.<br/><br/>The fact that Apatow was able to make a film this incredibly funny and still have this very real male vs female battle the likes I haven't seen since When Harry Met Sally is pretty impressive. I think Knocked Up will become a new generations When Harry Met Sally because it truly deserves it. This film shows a lot of very funny parts in the trailer but unlike some unfortunate comedies when those parts come up they are still funny and even more hilarious because of the story and script around it. There were moments where I was still laughing from the previous joke when a new one comes about. Go see this one immediately, take the one you love and discuss it after because it turns in an incredible film. It runs a little long, clocks in at well over 2 hours but doesn't apologize for that because there is plenty to the story. Check it out!! 9/10"
"bdavidson10","10","0","7","4 June 2007"," Best American comedy since Something About Mary
","This movie is absolutely hilarious, and sustains the comedy throughout, instead of getting sagged down in maudlin sappery as others in this genre are likely to do. The script is smart, with up-to-the-minute pop-culture references, and despite the somewhat amoral one-night-stand-cum-pregnancy premise and raunchy dialog, is surprisingly old-fashioned in its treatment of the romance between the main characters. There are also a number of other three-dimensional characters in the movie, each of whom is interesting in his or her own right, and comedic as well (especially Paul Judd's character), rather than dead weight or mere props. I hope this movie beats out Spiderman, Shrek, Pirates, et al as the box office king of the summer."

"IfYouSeekChandler","9","0","3","3 June 2007"," Disgusting, full of unnecessary vulgarity, inappropriate.... and yet unbelievably hilarious!
","This movie was over-the-top, disgusting, filled with unnecessary sexual and drug references, crude humor, and countless swearwords. It goes against all morals and usually I would loathe something so disgusting. But it just turns out that I loved this film.<br/><br/>It was unique, even with a very cliché plot. It was nothing like what I expected walking into the theater, but I was rolling on the floor in tears for the majority of the movie. My favorite scenes were by far the ones between Debbie and Pete. The acting was very good.<br/><br/>The only thing I had a problem with was the excessive nudity. There was a lot of breasts that I felt could have been cut out. The rest, however, attributed to one hell of a comedy.<br/><br/>The thing that concerned me was the number of children in the theater. Because of the very mature content, I'd recommend anyone under 17 to steer clear of this until your 17th birthday. Parents, please don't assume that it is not too vulgar for your child. I assure you, you'll regret it. This is coming from a fourteen-year-old that is admitting TO HERSELF that this movie was far too mature for a teenager. Your teenager would probably love this movie, but I guarantee you that there is a lot of content in the film that you would not want your child to see for a long time."
"moutonbear25","8","0","2","3 June 2007"," Settling is funny
","Judd Apatow is something of a contemporary creative hero. He is a man who works within a rigid system and delivers consistently hilarious fare that manages to remain oddly honest and revealing. The director of THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN returns this summer with KNOCKED UP, a comedy about dealing with the unexpected that lives up to all its expectations. After one night of drunken, messy sex, Alison and Ben (Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen) find themselves in a situation many have found themselves in before, pregnant. Alison is fresh from a promotion while Ben is busy doing nothing at all. Neither expected to see the other ever again, much less raise a child together. This is horrible timing for both of them but both must learn that nothing makes two people grow up faster than having a baby. And what do two grown-ups do when faced with a less than ideal scenario like this one? Why they give up on looking for love and force a relationship to form between each other for the sake of their child and in the interest of being responsible human beings. The idea that they could actually be successful is hilarious enough in itself.<br/><br/>Apatow sets us up from the start. We meet Ben in the middle of a stoned back yard boxing match of enormous proportions. Moments later, we meet Alison waking to her alarm so that she can prepare for her responsible day as a functional member of society. They meet each other in a bar later that day. Alison is there to celebrate her promotion and Ben is there to drink. Alison is young and vibrant; Ben is a pudgy stoner. He is not without charm but social hierarchies would keep him way out of her league. And so KNOCKED UP begins its journey into the male fantasy. In this fantasy, a male nobody can get with a female somebody with absolutely no explanation that would give it any sort of rational sense. Without it though, there would be no premise to develop. Further to this, Alison decides that she and Ben should do their best to be together. This successful woman who already has a supportive family that could help her through her pregnancy and raise the child suddenly sees no chance of finding her own happiness and learns to settle. <br/><br/>Are you laughing yet? C'mon, this is funny stuff. The funniest thing about KNOCKED UP is that it actually is funny. Heigl and Rogen both turn in fantastic performances that will certainly leave audiences wanting even more of them. They are also surrounded by a number of supporting players who may be one-sided but make the most of their limited depth. On Alison's side, Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd play Alison's sister and her husband. They too found themselves unexpectedly pregnant when they were younger and decided to take a shot at happiness together. Only, all these years later, he makes excuses to be out of the house to clear his head and she doesn't trust that he's being faithful. On Ben's side, he's got a pack of stoner buddies (Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill and Martin Starr) who help him keep it real. They also stop him from becoming the man he needs to be if he's going to be a good father. Where Apatow's talent steps in is in making all of this symbolism apparent without being the least bit obvious or overwrought. The entire cast is clearly having a blast with their characters and with each other, making it impossible not to laugh along with them. There are also more pop culture references than you can shake a ""Gilmore Girls"" series finale at.<br/><br/>Despite all their chemistry though, Heigl and Rogen never fully convince me that they have actually fallen in love. Sure they each learn a thing or two about themselves and how to be better to each other but in the end, Apatow does more damage than good. One walks away from KNOCKED UP thinking that a baby can bring people together or save a relationship. One also walks away thinking that to grow up means to leave your dreams and frivolity behind you, to settle in to a potential life of boredom and disappointment. Finally, and fortunately for all involved, one also walks away from KNOCKED UP laughing one's ass off and not caring one bit about convention and the dangers that stem from it."

","I actually didn't expect much out of this one but was hysterically surprised. I went with my 17 year old sister. She enjoyed the movie but stated some parts were quite shocking for her. So I would definitely recommend this one for maturer audiences. Other than that I thought it was a great script, cast, and acting. The dialogue is hilarious. Even more so because it hits closer to home on the female-male relationship dynamic. Go see it! Screw Pirates III. This one is a must-see. Funniest movie I've seen since Wedding Crashers.

"fairchildm","7","0","2","3 June 2007"," A surprisingly meaningful film well-beyond typical expectations
","Going in to this movie, most viewers are expecting the all too typical formula of sex, drug and male incompetence jokes and one-liners that tends to abound in the summer comedy movie season. Make no mistake, all of those elements remain largely intact, but this film still boasts an unexpected maturity as it unfolds. Despite the moral shortcomings of one, if not both, of the main characters, this film finds them both to be surprisingly real characters that gradually rise to the challenge of impending parenthood with a humanity that subtly engages the sympathies of the audience. Although it possesses many memorable comedic moments, and the film certainly can be enjoyed as a comedy alone, its dramatic tones are perhaps the most meaningful. This film often displays the fear, uncertainty and awkwardness of the characters so strongly and accurately, though, that the comedy is more required as a needed emotional break for the audience then as an integral component of the plot or movement. In many respects, this most was reminiscent of the often under-rated 'Parenthood', which similarly balanced strikingly real family drama with thoroughly enjoyable comedic interludes. While several scenes of sexual content and drug use make this film unfortunately inappropriate for younger viewers, its positive message of mismatched expecting parents growing together through their shared commitment to the child about to enter their lives is quaint, honest and meaningful beyond the outward appearances of this film."
"redviola41","7","0","2","2 June 2007"," Great foundation, but could use some work
","Based on the trailers I had seen for this movie, I went in pretty excited to see it. Everything beforehand, including trailers and reviews, had pretty much indicated that I'd be in for a ""laugh-a-minute."" And for the most part, I was.<br/><br/>I was a big fan of the whole main plot of the story: boy and girl meet, hit it off (albeit with the help of alcohol), and have a one-night-stand, only to meet up again 8 weeks later for Allison to tell Ben that she is pregnant. So goes their story of how they need to try to make a relationship work, for the baby's sake. Great! I was totally in the mood for this, and really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The pitfalls of the movie were few, but enough. Mainly, they were just aspects of the film that I personally did not find necessary. The subplot of the Debbie-and-Pete-and-their-bad-marriage was interesting at first, but wore thin when both characters started acting so completely ridiculous and unbelievable. Debbie did seem slightly neurotic, but not so neurotic that she would follow Pete to a stranger's house oh a whim that he was cheating, and then ask him to not come home after she found out that he was, in fact going to fantasy baseball meetings behind her back. By the same token, why was it necessary for Pete and Ben to venture all the way to Las Vegas and get high on mushrooms to realize the problems in their relationships, and how they should fix them? These two instances seemed to me like drawn out examples of what was wrong in Debbie and Pete's relationship, an issue that, in terms of the movie, could have been shortened by a lot.<br/><br/>Likewise, the frequent scenes with Ben and his (very high) friends grew old, and while there were some very funny lines, these scenes just stopped serving a purpose after a while. Though I have to admit, the scene with all of them in the waiting room at the end was hysterical.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish that Ben had decided to get his act together sooner. I really liked the person he had grown into by the end of the movie, and would have loved to see that progress little by little throughout the movie, instead of in the last 25 minutes or so.<br/><br/>While the last three paragraphs have indicated a sort of dislike for the movie, it isn't that way at all. I enjoyed this film a LOT, and there were some moments that had me laughing so hard, I thought I'd pass out. When all is said and done, you really will leave the theater with a happy feeling!"
