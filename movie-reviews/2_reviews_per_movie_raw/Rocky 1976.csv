","It's hard to explain what this movie means to me. Words could never. I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle's and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone's vision. The realization that only the original would ever really matter.<br/><br/>Rocky to me is so many things. I had to beg my girlfriend to see it. She said she doesn't like boxing. I almost dumped her right there. If she wasn't so hot, I probably would have. I was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. To me it was never that. It's about a guy, much like you or me, who's down on his luck and everyday feels like Sunday. He's pushing 30, single and broke. I'm sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. Every minute more another reason. <br/><br/>It's hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. I love the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian (Shire). When he's talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. It's a thing of beauty. Or when Mickey (Meredith) goes over to Stallones apartment. Rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall, then goes to hide in the bathroom. The look on Stallone's face when he comes out to find Mickey still there is priceless. I heard it wasn't in the script or directed, just happened. But the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. He turns on his record player and goes for a beer, but it's empty, like everything else in his life. Talks to the turtles and his fish, why because the Rock is lonely. Goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. Looks at a picture of himself and realizes he's wasting his life. It's more than beautiful or real.<br/><br/>It's safe to say that I have seen the original more than 100 times. I still feel all the emotion. I love this movie more than any other film. I hope one day, with God's help, to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. I think if I ever got the chance to meet Stallone, I'd want to thank him. Tell him how he changed my life. But in reality, he probably wouldn't care. Because, ""I'm at least half a bum."""
"TheSixthChild","10","177","207","28 December 2003"," His whole life was a million-to-one shot...
","When I was a kid there were only three major things in my life: food, wrestling and `Rocky'. My brother and I followed the numerous Rocky Balboa struggles religiously, and even today, there is no exception. Although the latest efforts of Stallone have been pitiful, the movie that made his career is the 1977 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, `Rocky'. On top of that, `Rocky' also earned two more Academy Awards for Best Film-Editing and Best Director (John G. Avildsen).<br/><br/>This movie is unlike any other ever put on film. It's films like this that remind us of the beauty that is going to the cinema, and if only I was around during that year when such films as `Close Encounters of the Third Kind', `Jaws', `Saturday Night Fever' and `Network' were all playing in cinemas. The storyline takes place in Philadelphia, where Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) struggles to make a living as both a small-time boxer, and the brawn of a loan shark. Until one day, a sudden opportunity is handed to Rocky to compete for the World Heavy-Weight Title against the champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), a charismatic and flamboyant fighter labelled as `The King of Sting' and `The Master Of Disaster'. Attracted to Rocky's reputation as ""The Italian Stallion"", a match between Creed and the unknown boxer is set, which is subsequently advertised as a fight where a ""nobody"" can become a ""somebody"". Mickey (Burgess Meredith), is the owner of the gym where Rocky trains and later becomes Rocky's manager. Mickey is passionate about the world of boxing, and believes that Rocky has the potential to go the distance, instead of being `a cheap second rate loan-shark'. However, the central character in Rocky's life is Adrian (Talia Shire), a shy pet-store clerk, who acts awkwardly when Rocky even breathes in her direction. However, these almost completely distant outcasts are strangely drawn to each other. While one `didn't have much of a brain', the other `didn't have much of a body', so they worked on their opposites, only to end up together. The legend of this film when it was first released in the mid-70's was: `His whole life was a-million-to-one shot', but what Stallone did was prove to the world that `Rocky' is one-in-a-million.<br/><br/>Seeing `Rocky' is both a cinematic experience and a religious experience. When first released, the film appealed to the widest audience, and all felt the emotion and intense passion which passed from the film, to them. The film's possession of realistic acting, superb dialogue and the most phenomenal music score by Bill Conti to date, indeed transformed the face of cinema. Stallone's wholesome performance of his own screenplay is electrifying as the film celebrates of the underdog battling to beat the odds. Fans of cinema aren't manipulated into thinking that the inevitable will happen as it does in every other tedious hero drama.<br/><br/>Over 25 years on, `Rocky' still manages to let the audience's emotions explode; Rocky's blossoming relationship with Adrian, the seedy worlds of Mickey and Adrian's alcoholic brother, Paulie (Burt Young), and the affirmation of Rocky's inability to overcome Creed. And who could forget the excruciatingly compelling Balboa / Creed confrontation? Rocky's determination overturns the boxing fraternity, and supplies cinemaphiles with one of the greatest moments in cinematic history, as a body of spectators both on-screen and off applaud and chant for Rocky in unison. The following four Rocky sequels attempted to deliver the same magic as the original, however failed to convey it's message. `Rocky' illustrates how life itself is stifling and perplexing, but sometimes when you lose your way as well as your original intentions, you may just find something better.<br/><br/>Simply put, if anyone has a free Friday / Saturday night, this is the film to go out and borrow from the local video store. It's unbelievable that this film was only voted in at #78 on the AFI Top 100 films of all time, and worse yet, was voted in at the SECOND best sports film of all time (the first went to `Hoosiers', starring Gene Hackman). C'mon people, be you black or white or brown or any other skin colour we have yet to discover, get out there and be inspired by Stallone's masterpiece, `Rocky'."
"Obi-Wan Wilson","10","245","291","26 February 2003"," One of the greatest movies of all time.
","I don't remember exactly when I first saw this film, but for a long time I thought that the second of the series was my favorite.  Well, I recently bought the DVD box-set and after I watched the first movie again I knew that it was definitely the best in the series, and also one of the best movies ever made.  Rocky is very much more than just a boxing movie.  It's a movie about the unbreakable human spirit, determination, and the will to ""go the distance.""  Rocky(Sylvester Stallone) is a second rate club-fighter and a debt collector for a loan shark(Joe Spinnell).  He becomes involved with a shy girl working in a petshop named Adrian(Talia Shire), and also becomes friends with her brother Paulie(Burt Young).  Rocky's life really isn't anything of interest - until the World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) gives him an unexpected shot at the title.  An old boxer-turned-trainer named Mick(Burgess Meredith) offers to be Rocky's manager.  Although the whole film is outstanding, what follows are some of the greatest and most memorable movie moments of all time.  Rocky striving to go the distance in the training scene, the final fight, and the closing moments of the film are so emotional and inspiring that they perfectly demonstrate the human spirit and can bring out the will to win in anybody. Add to this an excellent music score and you have  a classic and unforgettable movie.  Without a doubt deserved the Best Picture award in 1976.   Exceptional performances by all the cast members, notably Burgess Meredith and Sylvester Stallone.  **** out of ****"

","""Your gonna eat lightning and your gonna crap thunder"" <br/><br/>Rocky is about a poor boxer living his life in Philadalphia. His life changes when an invitation from the heavyweight champ Apollo Creed is given to him.<br/><br/>Romance, Drama, Fight.<br/><br/>Story- With minimum resources and low money, this movie was an underdog itself. Stallone wrote it and fought to play Rocky. When they were low on resources, they changed the story all together and made it even better. The story is flawless and keeps you on the edge of your seat. 9/10 <br/><br/>Music- The best thing about the movie itself. The music in this movie is guaranteed to give you goosebumps every time you watch it. Bill Conti gives you an excellent score throughout the movie, including the famous ""gonna fly now"". 10/10 <br/><br/>Acting- 4 nominated performances in this movie. The acting is very good as well, especially Burgess Meredith who offers one of the greatest acts I have ever seen. Stallone plays Rocky Balboa and changes his voice very well to be Rocky. He did a very good job. Talia Shire plays Adrian, a shy pet store owner who has never had a BF before. She did a good job as well. Burt Young plays the drunkard Paulie. Burgess Merideth plays the boxing trainer Mickey. I have never seen a better performance. 9.5/10 <br/><br/>Stallone fought for this triumphant movie that made me want to go the distance (sounds corny but its true). It made me strive to work harder and not give up. If you haven't seen this, buy it and watch it. I'll guarantee it will change you too. A classic.<br/><br/>I give it a perfect 10/10"
"forsaken999","10","71","82","14 May 2000"," NOT A BOXING MOVIE!
","The first common misconception about Rocky, and something that's almost inevitable when you put a half-naked Stallone with boxing gloves on the cover is that it's a fighting movie.  In that time it would fall into a category including Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jackie Chan.  Now don't get me wrong, I like both of these actors a lot, they're among my favorites, but Rocky is not just another cheap movie about a man who like to win a fight or tournament because he deserves it (Bloodsport, Quest).  Instead of a fighting movie we should say that it is a movie about a fighter.  That changes the context altogether, it means that sure he has fighting on his mind but has other personal issues that are demonstrated throughout the movie.  In fact in the whole movie there are two fight scenes (at the beginning and at the end) which together add up to about 15 minutes.<br/><br/>
The rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart.  That is to say that he keeps his moral and ethics, just keeps on trying no matter the hardships.  A MAN WITH A DREAM... an un-realizable dream to be frank.  But in the end, a lot, even most, of our dreams are un-realizable... but we try anyway.  The difference here is that this man is given a shot at his dream, a ""one-in-a-million shot"". It's something that we all would like so we can relate and CAN'T HELP but cheer for him at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The largest portion, in minutes, of the movie is actually devoted to the love theme between Rocky and Adrien.  So that should maybe make this a ""love story"" movie instead of fighting movie.  Adrien is another of his dreams, slightly more attainable which is why he devotes more of his time everyday to trying to attain it (her).  She won't open up to anybody but in the end, with a certain amount of tenacity on the part of Stallone, she can't help but fall for the heart deep inside the rough exterior.<br/><br/>Another theme here is that of fraternity between Rocky and Mickey, his trainer/manager.  In fact THE MOST TOUCHING SCENE in the whole movie in my opinion is one of about 15 to 20 seconds long and without any words.  It's when Mickey goes to see Rocky at his home the first time to see if he can manage him.  Rocky gets angry with him but keeps it to himself until Mickey leaves, at which point Rocky takes it out on the door jam and yells at Mickey who can still hear him outside.  Rocky's life is being turned upside down by this whole ""fighting Creed"" business and although it is his dream, he doesn't know how to deal with it and is scared to get mangled in the ring, knowing he's not of the same caliber as the champ.  The touching scene is when he realizes that he has yelled at an old man.  His heart takes him out into the street after Mickey, he joins him and shakes his hand.  The beginning of an enduring friendship which will ultimately lead to tears in a later film (Rocky 3 and 5).<br/><br/>This movie simply seeps with ""classic"", and by the end you know you have just seen a movie of courage, of the portrayal of ""the indominable spirit of man"" (Rocky 3).  No matter the difficulties, Rocky's heart takes him through it all.  It doesn't fit the mold of today's classics (like Private Ryan) with melodrama and grandiose scenery, just a simple movie, with simple qualities but very large meaning intricately woven into the fabric of the film itself by Stallone and the director John G. Avildson, with the musical overtones of Bill Conti.  A classic from a different age, and the mold of a lot of movies to follow."
"MovieAddict2016","10","213","266","5 May 2003"," The Raging Bull Named Rocky...
","""Rocky"" is about a man. It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, ""You have to be a moron to want to box.""<br/><br/>Rocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before ""Rocky"" was ""Weekend at Kitty and Stud's,"" and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in ""Rocky."" Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.<br/><br/>Stallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.<br/><br/>He lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.<br/><br/>After he returns from his ""job"" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>But things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. ""An Italian found America,"" Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.<br/><br/>But Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music ""Gonna Fly Now"" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.<br/><br/>The most entertaining thing about ""Rocky"" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, ""Are you sure she knows I'm coming?"" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.<br/><br/>And the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, ""This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!"" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.<br/><br/>Things like that are what make ""Rocky"" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.<br/><br/>But the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, ""Rocky"" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with ""Rocky"" all the more."
"marcrice","10","11","11","26 March 2016"," Great movie, great soundtrack a classic
","What can you say about a this movie that has not been said already? It is my all time favorite movie series ever and I could watch every movies back to back time and time again. I have owned this movie series on Video, DVD, Blu-ray and owned just about every version going.<br/><br/>The main story is about one mans struggles to overcome the odds life has stacked against him but it is also a love story. There are real touches of greatness such as Burgess Meredith as Mickey as veteran boxer who does not want to train Rocky as he sees him as a washed out bum until he is offered a shot at the big time. Then seeing his relationship with Rocky grow. The acting is superb and the music still pumps my blood to this day. This may have been the movie to invent the training montage which is now a must in any movie about sports or fighting. Stallone's performance is phenomenal as the film celebrates the underdog battling to beat the odds and it is still amazing almost 40 years after release."
"crumpler","9","122","155","14 November 2004"," What it is to be and ""underdog""
","One of Stallone's first and finest feature film performances is as Rocky Balboa, a lonely, small-time boxer who gets by doing muscle work for a neighborhood loan shark. Everything about his life spells ""underdog""-- he's even left-handed. He lives alone in a shabby apartment, and when he's not slowly being swept aside at the local gym, where even the trainer calls him a bum, he fauns over an introverted pet store clerk named Adrian.<br/><br/>He gets his first break when he's chosen at random by heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, to take a shot at his title. No one thinks he can beat Creed-- not even Rocky. All Rocky wants is to be able to go all ten rounds with the champ, because no one else has. And in the final ten minutes of the film, Rocky finds out just how far he can go.<br/><br/>What's terrific about this movie is that it's about Rocky. It's not about winning; it's not even about fighting. It's about Rocky and his desire to get by in the world without being a bum. The sequels to this widely popular film have focused more heavily on the upcoming fight, whereas this story focuses on Rocky's life. He doesn't want to win; he just wants to survive and feel good about himself. That's what most of us want, and that's why this film is a classic."
"rbverhoef","9","86","116","18 February 2005"," A great Sylvester Stallone film
","If you think Sylvester Stallone has made nothing but stinkers you just have to see 'Rocky'. This is a brilliant film, based on Stallone's own screenplay, where he plays a complex character in such a terrific way it is not strange people thought this was going to be a great actor. Compare it to another great film about a boxer, 'Raging Bull', and 'Rocky' will be better at some points. It goes without saying that it's quite an achievement.<br/><br/>The story is about Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a boxer who once had a glorious future, but now fights for little money in gyms. Then, out of the blue, he gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champ Apollo (Carl Weathers), a stunt from his side. Although Rocky seems to have no chance he starts his training to make the best of it, although at first he is too proud to accept any help. The scene where he finally accepts the help from his old trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is one of the best scenes in the film. Rocky also starts dating the very shy girl Adrian (Talia Shire), sister of his friend Paulie (Burt Young).<br/><br/>'Rocky' is a terrific film in every aspect. The acting is what amazed me the most. Stallone gives such an impressive performance it is very hard to believe he is also the star of films like 'Over the Top', 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot' and 'Judge Dredd', and from the other 'Rocky'-films for that matter. Not only Stallone is impressive, Shire, Young and Meredith find perfect notes for their characters as well. Every little thing that happens seems natural through their acting and of course Stallone's screenplay does a great job here. Director John G. Avildsen serves this material the way he should. Of course he is no Martin Scorsese, 'Raging Bull' stays the better directed film, but he knows how to tell this story.<br/><br/>I do not like boxing very much, so a boxing-film is not something I would enjoy. But this is not a boxing-film, it is a film about a boxer. It tells about a character who happens to be a boxer running for a title. This is probably one of the points where the other four 'Rocky'-films fail and where films like this one and 'Raging Bull' and Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' succeed."
"b_u_n_44","10","18","21","4 March 2002"," The fact that Rocky isn't on the top 250 is kinda sad.
","Rocky is one of two great boxing movies. Only Raging Bull challenges Rocky as the greatest boxing movie of all time.

There is no doubt in my mind it should be at least in the top 25."

","As much as the media mocks Stallone, he won best picture for this film. He will never top this film, which made him a icon.  It's a story about a down on his luck loan collector/ boxers who gets a one time shot at the heavy weight championship, because of a late pull out by a contender, and the champ does not want to lose his money on the deal.  There is romance between Rocky and his new girl friend who lives just as hard of a life as Rocky, and together they make life livable. The rest of the cast is other down and outers who give the viewer a feeling of hopelessness until Rocky gets his chance.  This film is touching, and unforgettable."

The movie is an absolute masterpiece and can be enjoyed time and time again. I've seen it countless times myself. I hold this film close to my heart. Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay in 2 days, but you would never guess that judging by the depth of the film. It's an emotional roller-coaster that keeps you coming back for more. Rocky Balboa is up there as one of Hollywood's greatest ever creations. <br/><br/>It's a very basic movie, but that's what we all love about it. The best films are usually like that. Very rare a big-budget blockbuster will take home an Oscar. Not only is it a love story, but it's also a boxing tale as we go on an unforgettable journey with The Itallian Stallion. <br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is my favorite actor, and for good reason. During the Creed movie he stole the show and should have won as Oscar for his latest portrayal as Balboa. Stallone is not only a great actor, but also a director and writer too. He can do it all. Some say Rambo is his greatest creation, but for my money nothing comes close to Rocky Balboa."
"colm-hearne365","8","5","5","28 July 2016"," Rocky through the ages
","For this review, I'd like to go through all the Rocky movies (including the most recent Creed) and talk about their good points and their bad points. <br/><br/>Rocky - The first one is obviously a classic and the best out of the series and made people like Sylvester Stallone a superstar. It takes a simple but touching story of the underdog boxer and rise to have a chance to be a champion. <br/><br/>Rocky II - I felt was kind of the same story and was a little cheesy but it still carried the spirit of the original.<br/><br/>Rocky III - Like the second one, was cheesy but it was entertaining. But I like how Rocky was doing more boxing and had more drama and Mr. T was a good villain even though he talked too much. Also it featured a great song, ""Eye of the Tiger"".<br/><br/>Rocky IV - Again like the two other sequels, cheesy but still entertaining and it had another great song ""No Easy Way Out"". <br/><br/>Rocky V - I know this one disappointed a lot of fans but I thought it was okay but I can understand why people didn't like it but I don't think it deserves to be hated.<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa - Was redeeming and I like how it has a lot of references to the first Rocky. <br/><br/>Creed - Finally, this one was another great comeback for Stallone as Rocky and gave Michael B. Jordan his big break as well. <br/><br/>But you can't beat the original because it's the first and a classic, like I said before. But I'm still looking forward to the sequel to Creed next year."

","Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a struggling Italian/American boxer who also earns cash collecting debts for shady Philadelphian 'businessman' Gazzo (Joe Spinell). When heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) finds himself without an opponent for his upcoming match, he offers the unknown fighter a chance at the title as a gimmick, but doesn't count on Rocky's determination to go the distance.<br/><br/>I watched Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull not that long ago, an excellent film, but something of a downer—a gritty study of a not very nice character whose horrible personality and poor choices see him winding up losing everything. Rocky, on the other hand, is a real feel-good film about a guy on the skids who is given a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to make something of himself. It's an uplifting Cinderella story, a classic underdog tale that leaves the viewer with a big smile on their face, which is why I prefer it slightly over Scorsese's film.<br/><br/>Rocky also has a great story behind the making of the film which mirrors that of its main character: star Stallone went from an almost broke struggling actor to Hollywood mega-star by not only writing the script for Rocky, but also insisting that he play the title role. The rest, as they say, is history.<br/><br/>Those only familiar with Stallone's later action hero work will be surprised at how good an actor he is in his breakthrough role, tackling the drama just as well as the boxing: Rocky's burgeoning romance with shy pet store clerk Adrian (Talia Shire), his friendship with her brother Paulie (Burt Young), and his strained relationship with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) are all handled superbly.<br/><br/>Director John G. Avildsen also manages all aspects of his film with aplomb, with the final fight between Rocky and Apollo being the absolute showstopper, a gruelling battle of wills, both combatants pushed to their limits. Add a rousing score from Bill Conti and what you have is an unmissable, uplifting classic of the '70s.<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10, rounded up to 10 for IMDb."
"khodan","10","8","9","9 July 2011"," American Masterpiece
","Over the Fourth of July, I was channel surfing and caught Rocky on AMC....and as usual, after watching about 20 seconds, it sucked me in again to watch it for the 124th time or so. Since it's been about 35 years since Rocky premiered, I was waxing nostalgic about the film.<br/><br/>It's so impressive now to remember that Stallone wrote the film, then went up against the Hollywood movie industry and got it made even though he had only been in a few previous movies prior to this. AND, he wouldn't sell it unless he was cast to play the title character, turning down offers even though he was broke and hungry at the time. He believed...and wouldn't compromise.<br/><br/>So basically, as a kid, a novice in Hollywood, Sylvester Stallone created one of the true all- time classic American movies....a masterpiece that has grown even stronger over time....with an Academy Award, necessary or not, to add its official stamp of approval.<br/><br/>Over the years of his career since them he has had many ups and downs. He's been the butt of jokes, always type-cast, let his celebrity status overshadow his movie roles. He's been grouped in with Schwarzenegger, Seagal, Van-Damme...just another cookie-cutter action- hero...and hey, he's chosen the roles that put him there. Nobody's ever compared him to Pacino, Spielberg, or any of the upper echelon of the Hollywood elite.<br/><br/>But then there's Rocky. It'll probably never place higher than The Godfather on the all-time lists....never compare to Citizen Kane or Casablanca in film school discussions...or mentioned in conversations discussing Pulp Fiction or Schindler's List. <br/><br/>But Rocky is the cinema equivalent of Tom Sawyer, The Grapes of Wrath, The Old Man and the Sea....a true American classic. <br/><br/>His portrayal of the title character (which was probably more just being himself than acting) embodied what all us guys want to be. He was a guy who knew where he came from, he didn't have much, but what he had was yours if you needed it, he tried to guide those in his neighborhood down the right path, he remembered to always feed and care for his pet turtles, Cuff and Link...he was a street-tough that was sweet, kind and gentle. He was a friend to a guy, Paulie, who didn't deserve his friendship, and he fell in love with a woman and treated her as if she were a Queen. He knew he couldn't offer her much in the way of the material trappings of life, so he gave her what he could...himself, his heart and his unconditional love....He was humble in attitude, and gave respect to everyone, regardless of their position in life. Stallone wrote and portrayed the character that all us American guys hope and try to be. And when offered the chance to make a dream come true, Rocky Balboa accepted the challenge. The South Philly lunk put his American work ethic into achieving his goal...something all of us are...or want to believe we are...doing in our own lives.<br/><br/>The hero doesn't win in the end, at least not on the scorecard...but his victory comes from knowing that he gave it his all...he didn't give up. <br/><br/>So this is a movie that grabs your heart and shows you that if you believe that good things can happen...and if you just be true to yourself...that the journey is itself the victory, and the people we love and who love us are the real treasures in our lives. If you're not cheering at this movie, than you may not have a pulse...and you're definitely lacking a soul.<br/><br/>When you're in one of those ruts where nothing seems to be going your way, when bad luck is your constant companion, and you're asking yourself, what's the use? Rocky will give you an encouraging pat on the shoulder, a firm kick in the butt, and let you know that you're not alone in your struggles.<br/><br/>That a kid outta Hells Kitchen wrote the script, and nailed the lead role, is an underdog story in itself. No matter what Stallone has done since...or will do in the future....he created Rocky, one of the greatest American movies..and characters... .ever made. No one can ever take that from him. <br/><br/>So thank you Sylvester Stallone. I'm grateful for the gift of your movie."

","The first installment of the ROCKY franchise,ok I know people are split on these movies and thats fine but I am a fan and these movies get me every time,you are not suppose to care about the reality of the situation you are not suppose to care about the possibilities you are just suppose the get on board like any other movie be it sci-fi or fantasy or whatever,it is a movie about a guy who dreams of grandeur but hasn't got a hope in hell and when an opportunity knocks on his door he answers it.this film has a love story and it is essentially this love that drives him.ROCKY is not to mental but is all physical and so his mind tells him he must use this because it is all he has.the movie has a good story line but obviously the title bout is the endgame and sought after in the movie it does not disappoint for 1976 in my opinion....this movie is MARMITE hate it or love it"

","What makes a great film? Engaging characters, immersive story-line, brilliant editing, fantastic music, an experience you can revisit again and again. Rocky has all of this and more.<br/><br/>When it comes to performance I honestly do not know where Rocky starts and Sylvester Stallone ends. Stallone did not just play this character he conceived, created and crafted it. This is not method acting this goes way beyond that.<br/><br/>What is this film about? Loneliness, love, self-respect, poverty, heartache, shyness, chance, pride, friendship, boxing? It is about life!<br/><br/>Rocky is a downtrodden character, in the words of Mickey (Burgess Meredith) Rocky is a bum, a loser, he had talent but never applied it. Rocky does not see this, he lives his life, he has some boxing skills which he puts to use in the occasional low-key cash fights and working as a money collector for the local crime lord (Joe Spinell). Rocky has the physical attributes for the debt collecting job but deep down he has a soft heart. He is not the smartest guy but ultimately he is a good guy.<br/><br/>Rocky is friends with Paulie (Burt Young) who is a deeply flawed character. Unlike Rocky he has a chip on his shoulder at life and the cards he has been dealt. Paulie has a sister Adrian (Talia Shire) that has not had an easy life either. She is painfully shy and introverted. Adrian works at the local pet shop which Rocky visits often. Rocky tries to make conversation and get to know her. The courtship between Adrian and Rocky is awkward at times but has a reality and sweetness that is undeniable. Rocky and Adrian eventually date.<br/><br/>Rocky's life is on a nowhere trajectory until out the blue his name is selected by Apollo Creed (Carl weathers) the heavy weight champion of the world as a publicity stunt. Apollo Creed wants to stage a boxing event where a lowly ranked amateur boxer gets a chance to fight for the title, ""The American dream"". Initially stunned and unwilling to take on this challenge, Rocky does not feel he is worthy or capable of this. Mickey eventually persuades Rocky to take this once in a lifetime chance. And so begins the rest of the film. Cue training montage.<br/><br/>Rocky works on many levels, that is why it is such a fantastic film. The characters have a human naivety and poignancy that resonates. The editing and music are sublime in parts. It is a film I will watch again and again and appreciate more each time 10 out of 10."
"skyluke1985","8","4","4","5 August 2016"," A story about real life winners
","First of all this movie is not about the boxing. This movie is about a fighter (Rocky) who struggles with his life without losing his courage to continue pursuing his dreams. It is movie about courage, about love, about unfulfilled dreams. It is a movie that shows with which the real life winners are made from. In the first scenes we meet Rocky. The man who tries to make some cash by participating in low level boxing games, but he doesn't want to. He knows that his life and his potential is far above. Then he comes back home where he reveals to us his loneliness and his unhappiness for himself. He is so lonely that he is talking to his turtles, sharing his news with them and feeding them. After he looks himself in the mirror, where there are hanging photos of his childhood and early life and next to the mirror is a poster of his idol, the boxer Rocky Marciano. His is unhappy about his life and thinking that his life turned to be different than it should be. The important thing is that behind his loneliness and his disappointment is a smile that never fades away and a positive attitude for life. Although life has treated him bad, he is not a give up guy and continue to pursue his dreams. <br/><br/>The movie has exceptional character interactions. The first one is between Rocky and his dream girl, Adrian. She works at the pet store of the neighborhood where Rocky bought his turtles. She is a lonely and shy girl. She doesn't have any friends, same as Rocky. Rocky trying to flirt her but she is too shy to give in. She like him too but she's afraid because she doesn't want to get hurt because she doesn't trust him. In the end she gave up and Rocky seems more relaxed. His face is more calm and feels stronger to pursuit his other dreams. <br/><br/>The other interaction is between Rocky and his coach Mickey. Mickey is an old and difficult to handle man but with a heart of gold. He always knew where Rocky potential is but he was disappointed that Rocky ruined his life with his choices. A great scene is when Mickey visit Rocky at his home. Rocky is angry at him because he feels that Mickey doesn't help him when he was in need. He almost doesn't speak at him. On the other hand Mickey, has come to offer his help. The reasons are two in my opinion. Firstly he is feeling guilty for his behavior towards Rocky the past years and secondly to help someone else succeed in order to calm his ghost of past failures as a boxer. When Mickey leaves the house, Rocky blasts at him. All his pain comes out fiercely. Mickey can still hear him and Rocky knows it. Mickey leaves even more disappointed. At some point Rocky understands that he was yelling at an old man, a man who believes in him and a man he could help him reach his goals. He runs out of the house catching him and made peace at last. <br/><br/>The turning point in Rocky's life is the sunshine of luck after a bad strike of luck. He was chosen to confront in the ring the champion Apollo Creed for the title of the World Champion of the World. He isn't ready to deal with it. He is scared because he knows that Creed is out of his league. He is champion for god's sake and Rocky is just a low level boxer but with extreme potential. Adrian helps him to deal the fight mentally while Mickey trains him for the match of his life. An important point in the movie, which shows us the character of Rocky, is the night before the match when he talks to Adrien. As expressing his fears to her at some point says that he doesn't care if he win. The only thing that matters to him is not to fall because he knows that this have never happened before in Apollo matches. If he achieve it then he would know that he is not just a bump but someone who has really achieved something in his life. <br/><br/>The important background of this movie is the story of Stallone himself. A man like Rocky who can't find the way to succeed in life, writes the script of this film and run to producers to sell it, but with one condition, Stallone to play Rocky. Almost everyone turned him down. Fortunately almost everyone. Stallone got his chance as his character does and both fight the battle of their life at the exact same time."

","It's always important to be aware of what you are about to watch whenever you are going to watch a Sylvester Stallone movie. There are multiple movies on his resumé that could have easily been thrown out of the window. ""Rocky"" is definitely not that movie! This is a movie that he wrote and starred in and showed his talent on both sides of the camera. It is a classic, but beautiful story about the hero who fails but still gets the girl in the end. Stallone plays the main character of Rocky Balboa and he shows all of his talents this time around. He proves that he is someone who is to be taken serious by the audience. The supporting cast, which includes stars like Talia Shire, Carl Weathers and Burgess Meredith helps the story forward and helps give our main guy a good sense of accomplishment in the end. Oh, and a lot of challenges! The twist to the classic love-rival story, ended up being one of the most successful accomplishments of all time. Who would have known...??"
"yxcool","8","67","115","16 February 2005"," Serious comments about the movie.
","If there is a chance for you which can turn you from nobody to somebody, how would you treat it? Would you let it go pass because it is almost impossible to achieve or you want to use all you have to give it a great shot? This is what the movie about, how a struggling underdog became hero, legend or more. This is the one of my favorite movies. Because it has a simplest storyline but it successfully gave expression to it's theme-if you want to be on the top, you have to pay the price which means hardworking and determination A good movie must require an understandable storyline which clearly tells its theme. That is why I think rocky is a great movie. The movie is about the sudden life change of a struggling underdog boxer-Rocky, the world champion set up a fight between himself and Rocky, but he decided to give it the greatest shot just to prove that he is not a bum for a entertainment show. So basically, whole movie is about how Rocky trying so hard to achieve his goal: go the distance with the champion.<br/><br/>The acting of the film is another shinning point; it has many great actors in it. Especially the main actor Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) he made a great impression in my mind by his excellent pyrotechnic acting skill. In the famous fighting scene, Stallone performed an emotion of a boxer who is suffering from pain, frustration and exhaustion, but he is not giving up. The scene became so real because Stallone's incredible performance. Also, other actors like Burt Young (Pauline), Tailia Shire (Adrian) Burgess (Mickey) acted perfectly in the movie.<br/><br/>If there is anything else can highlight the movie that is the fantastic music used in the movie. Because the music played in the movie perfectly contributed to the atmosphere of each individual scene. E.g. when Rocky started his morning run, pumping up style music plays simultaneously while he is running, that generated a memorable scene. Also again in the fighting scene, a part of passionate and stirring background music played when rocky is trying so hard to stand on his feet, it has successfully reinforced the mood of the scene.<br/><br/>This movie is simple but well made. Fantastic music, excellent action sequences and incredible acting crew lined with a nice storyline to express its theme: a man can be anyone he wants to be but is requires great determination and stamina to achieve that. The movie is appealed to audiences who are 15 or above, and strongly recommended to every boxing fan! PG Rating: 8/10"

","Initial outing dealing with a small-time boxer named Rocky (he took the nickname from real-life boxer Rocky Marciano) , he is panned as a down-and-out fighter , being nicknamed as the Chicken Stallion . But he gets a supremely rare chance to fight the heavy-weight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers , real life boxer Ken Norton was offered the role , but because he was 230 pounds, it was felt he would dwarf Stallone too much, and a smaller man was sought) in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect . Rocky attempts to prove himself and his girlfriend (Talia Shire , Carrie Snodgress was originally offered the role o but dropped out due to a disagreement about money , Susan Sarandon also auditioned) , friend (Burt Young , Stallone had originally wanted Harvey Keitel for the role) and trainer (Burguess Meredith who steals the show as an old coach , though the character was initially offered to Lee Strasberg) . <br/><br/>This enjoyable predictable entertainment displays splendidly various elements as drama , emotion and spectacular boxing . This soaper on the ring is developed in gentleness , dignity and feel-good style . Magnificent Stallone as a tough boxer , prior to shooting, Sylvester trained for six months with legendary fight-trainer Jimmy Gambina, who was also the film's technical adviser ; during this period, Stallone also studied every available piece of footage of boxers Rocky Marciano and Ezzard Charles. Great training montage and spectacular and climatic final bout . Writer-actor Stallone first entry is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling . Although Stallone famously wrote the first draft of the script in 3 days, it went through nine sizable rewrites before it was purchased by Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartof ; originally, Stallone's much darker script depicted Mickey/Burgess Meredith as a bitter old racist, and the film ended with Rocky throwing the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the professional boxing world . Originally the filmmakers wanted several former heavyweight champions to appear at the beginning of the fight between Rocky and Apollo ; they put out a call for all former champions to show, but on the day of the shoot only Joe Frazier turned up ; the filmmakers thought it worked well however, because Frasier is a resident of Philadelphia, which was where the movie was shot and took place . Some immortal scenes include the iconic shot of Rocky running up the steps of Philadelphia Art Museum came about because of Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown was from Philadelphia . Most of the scenes of Rocky jogging through Philadelphia were shot guerrilla-style, with no permits, no equipment and no extras . Good production design , though for the championship fight, the filmmakers had trouble getting extras to fill the arena because it was a low-budget film that was not yet known to anyone . Stock footage of crowds was used to help this problem, but empty seats are still visible in some shots . Emotive as well as unforgettable musical score by Bill Conti and atmospheric cinematography by James Crabe . The motion picture was rightly financed by the producers of complete saga , Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and compellingly directed by John G Avildsen , being shot in 28 days. The picture achieved big success as critical as public and in 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #57 Greatest Movie of All Time and ranked #2 on the list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Sports"" in June 2008. <br/><br/>Followed by various sequels that work at usual manner, fitting appropriately to franchise , even though we know the plot the films work, continuing the 'formula Rocky'¨, such as ¨Rocky II¨ was co-starred by Carl Weathers , in which Balboa returns to take on Apollo Creed ; ¨Rocky III¨ after being dethroned by obnoxious , corpulent Mr T from A Team ; ¨Rocky IV¨ against a massive Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren ; ¨Rocky 5¨with Tommy Morrison and Sage Stallone , real-life son plays Rocky Jr. and finally ¨Rocky Balboa¨ proving his estranged young son Milo Ventiglimia who still can fight ."

","After not seeing this film since it had come out in the theaters in 1976, I was almost shocked at how little action this movie had compared to what you see today....or in the Rocky sequels, for that matter. It's okay. It was needed to give us character studies of the main players: Rocky, his wife, his brother, his manager, etc., people we would see in subsequent films. Also, the fight scenes in those sequels went on too long, anyway. Frankly, I've enjoyed all the Rocky movies, beginning with this one.<br/><br/>In this film, the romance between ""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) and ""Adrian"" (Talia Shire) was a major subplot to the boxing saga. It reminded me a bit of the '50s film with Paul Newman, ""Somebody Up There Likes Me.""

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","3","3","30 September 2019"," Rocky and Sly is the underdog in a sport boxing cinema masterpiece that started all
","Rocky is a high quality movie it won the best picture at the oscars and it deserve it. It is a sport cinema masterpiece and Sylvester Stallone and Rocky is the underdog of the underdog story's. Sly was always poor and almost homeless in the 70's, he didn't had anything to eat. This is the best sport boxing drama of all time, I have ever seen. I would say ""Rocky"" and ""First Blood"" are the best movies in the franchise that Stallone filmed them. They started all. I am a huge Stallone fan I love him to death and the first original Rocky movie is the best one in the franchise. I love this film to death and it is Sylvester Stallone's best, best, best acting performance of all time.<br/><br/>""His whole life was a million to one shot.""<br/><br/>Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is a down on his luck Philadephia southpaw fighting at local club. When the world heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) choooses him as an unlikely opponent in his championship bicetennial fight, he's given the chance of a liftime. What wa soriginally planned as a publicitystunt becomes a chance for Rocky to prove himself as a prizefighter. While training with his cantnkerous maneger (Burgess Meredith). He also struggles to win a heart of his best friend's shy sister Adrian (Talia Shire). With the love of Adrian on his side, Rocky tries to overcome the odds, fighting with all his heart in the glorious and brutal finale.<br/><br/>Rocky was writen by Sylvester Stallone himself, when he saw the boxing match against Chuck Wepner vs Muhammad Ali who went all 15 rounds to distance and he pretty much had no chance. The inspiration for Rocky was boxer Chuck Wepner and Sly wrote his own story based on that boxer. He knocked on all doors asking studios if they interested in a boxing drama most of the studios rejected Sly. Until United Artists was interested in to making the film with Sly in the lead. Directed was beautiful by John G. Avildsen who directed beautiful this masterpiece sports boxing movie. John G. Avildsen 8 years later directed The Karate Kid (1984) another competition's sports drama movie and actor Rob Garrison who played Tommy from Cobra Kai just died this friday and it is sad. John G. Avildsen also past away two years ago both director and actor from The Karate Kid (1984) rest in peace they are both missed.<br/><br/>Butkus Stallone was a real dog in this movie that Sly used to own a dog. In the early 1970's. Sly was poor and almost homeless. He had no money for him and his dog Butkus so he sold his dog for $40 so that he could buy a food. Just like his character Rocky. He does the best he can to get buy. He fights in the boxing club with Spider Rico (Pedro Lovell) wins the fight but get's paid only $40. He is a collector for Tony Gazzo (Joe Spinell). That's what Rocky did in this movie for the living to get buy, he was a good heart man. He grab a homeless poor men and he walked him in to the bar. After studio payed Sly for the script for Rocky movie, Sly tracked down the owner of that dog and he bought his Butkus dog back for $15,000. So Butkus the dog was in this movie Stallone's real dog.<br/><br/>It is a beautiful story, I love how they shot the mean streets of Philadephia how they showed people at night walking the streets. I love the beautiful shots. How people on the street were that time and not today. I love the training seqquence how Rocky was runing trough a junkyard towards Columbus Blvd) I love the song Gonna Fly Now by Bill Conti. I love the dialouges Mickey: OK, I'm gonna tell ya! You had the talent to become a good fighter, but instead of that, you become a legbreaker to some cheap, second rate loanshark! Rocky: It's a living. Mickey: IT'S A WASTE OF LIFE! The final fight on the finale between Rocky and Apollo was realistic it was real and the fight was for real. in 2014 when I was by my dentist for my tooth problems and I saw all that blood all that hurt I told my dentist this is like Rocky I bloody match and he smiled and he said you said that well see you next round. I love this movie to death, It is a beautiful sports drama.<br/><br/>Burgess Meredith as Mickey, Rocky's tranior and menager did a great job he was the second heart of the film. The acting from everyone was realistic. Carl Weathers was great as Apollo Creed, he was excellent. Burt Young as Paulie was still great and funny in this movie. I don't like Creed (2015) spin off movie because it was remake of Rocky this movie and Adonis Creed was just a rich kid who had a daddy isuess and he quit his job to become a boxer for no reason. Rocky is the underdog, he is a poor and good heart. In my opinion Rocky is MILES way better movie than Creed movies nowdays and Raging Bull (1980) I never saw that film and I don't care.<br/><br/>Rocky is Sylvester Stallone's best movie her ever did, it is the underdog story in a sport cinema boxing masterpiece. Rocky IV, Rocky III, Rocky Balboa (2006) and Rocky II are my top four best Rocky movies of all time."

","Rocky was written and starred by then unknown actor but present Hollywood superstar Sylvester Stallone.<br/><br/>This 1976 Oscar Best Picture winner tells the story of a boxer that was given a once-in-a-lifetime shot at the world heavyweight title by the world boxing champion Apollo Creed,whose character is based on boxing legend Muhammad Ali.John Avildsen directed the film about an uneducated but kind-hearted debt collector who is a boxer in small-time fights at Philadelphia,Pennsylvania and how the opportunity that was given to him changed his life.In addition,we are also told of his love story with the shy and pet shop employee Adrian,who provides him tons of inspiration to face his challenges in life.<br/><br/>No question that this was the highest grossing movie on the year it was released.It continues to provide inspiration to millions of people not only when it was released in the United States when Americans were facing a lot of difficulties like unemployment due to a economic recession but to people around the world at present. Many got a lot of inspiration from Rocky especially when he managed to go the distance on his boxing match with Apollo. Added to that,it ushered six sequels from Rocky II to Rocky Balboa until a spin-off franchise entitled ""Creed"" was released that continues to provide inspiration to people to remain optimistic and hopeful in life.No question that it is the ultimate film that one will surely remember especially for people who gave strength and courage to face the challenges of life amidst pain and suffering.With that in mind,Rocky Balboa has remained one of the most endearing character in cinema for the last 50 years whether he faces a challenger as an underdog or whenever he acts as a trainer to Apollo's illegitimate son,Adonis Johnson a.k.a Adonis Creed."

","I've probably seen this movie a hundred times. It almost defies review at this point. But I'll do it anyway.<br/><br/>Rocky is a small time fighter who gets a one in a million shot at the heavyweight title. On the way, he falls in love with the girl from the pet shop, and wins the heart of the city of Philadelphia as he seizes his one shot at proving that he is not just another bum from the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Rocky is a product of its time. Its series of events literally occur about 6 days after I was born. In many ways, one can point to the courtship of Rocky and Adrian as a quasi-creepy encounter, one that would not fly in 2016. One could look at Paulie and Mickey and wonder what the hell is wrong with them. And one could wonder why Rocky beat out Taxi Driver for Best Picture. But every time I watch this, I just love it. So many iconic scenes, so many moments that just make your heart race and make you love it so much more. It is inspiring, it is timeless, it is a film for anyone who ever needed to just hang in there and still be standing at the end. Rocky fights for anyone who has ever been down but not out, Rocky is anyone who ever made the most of a one in a million chance. And anyone who can say the last scene did not put a tear in his eye is either flat out lying, or not even human.<br/><br/>Rocky is so much a part of my childhood that I probably can never be completely objective about this movie, and maybe my 10 star review will not persuade anyone to watch this. But it is what it is. If it affects you the way it affects me, then maybe you have the power to hang in no matter what life throws at you."

","A first-rate film that's about as close to perfect as any movie about boxing (or any other sport) that I've ever seen. The plot is very simple -- small-time boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is given a chance to fight the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). It sounds no different than a ton of old movies about the sport. But this film proves that it's not always how fresh or unique the story is but how well it's crafted. Rocky is a masterpiece of filmmaking with dynamite acting from Sylvester Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers. Many classic scenes, lines, characters. Bill Conti's score is one of the all-time greats. It was nominated for nine Oscars, winning three including Best Picture. It was director John G. Avildsen's best film and many would argue it is Stallone's best as well. Certainly his best screenplay. The fight choreography is terrific. Followed by a string of enjoyable sequels but they were just solid entertainment. This one is very entertaining but it is also something much more than that. It's one of those movies that becomes part of culture in a big way where everybody recognizes something from the film even if they've never seen it."

","Stallone is just perfect as Rocky, a ""bum"" who gets a shot at the Heavyweight title in Boxing. <br/><br/>What works perfectly here is the era in which this film was made. I seriously doubt that had this movie been made a decade later it would be half as charming. It's got that glorious 70's trashy style film-making and setting which made films like Midnight Cowboy or even Five Easy Pieces so appealing to begin with. The characters here feel real and authentic, and most of all, completely human. Nothing spectacular about them, more or less lowlifes who wouldn't arouse any interest in other people than social workers perhaps. <br/><br/>The script by Stallone is exceptionally good and completely deserved the Oscar. Rocky is a treasure of a character and Stallone plays him to perfection, really should have picked up an Oscar for that as well. This is basically a fairytale story in a different setting and almost feels very real."
"AlsExGal","6","10","16","29 April 2017"," The tortoise and the hare coupled with Georgie Girl
","Yes, this film is cute, upbeat, and likable. But the plot is so obvious and clichéd. Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed needs a boxing partner for his next fight and it is decided to give an average joe boxer the chance to win the title on January 1, 1976, the 200th anniversary of the United States declaring independence. Well actually that would be July 4, but I won't quibble. That average joe is 3rd rate boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) who makes ends meet by collecting for a mobster.<br/><br/>Rocky only has eyes for cripplingly shy plain Adrian (Talia Shire) who works in the pet store. Adrian lives with her alcoholic bully of a brother, Paulie, who is a butcher and friends with Rocky. It would be easy to scratch your head and ask why Rocky never gave up pursuing Adrian who, if she wasn't disinterested, was so shy she might never come out of her shell. But Rocky saw himself as a diamond in the rough, regardless of other people's opinions, and I think he took the time to realize this young woman was a diamond in the rough too if only she would come out of that shell.<br/><br/>Now everybody who can disrespects Rocky - the driver of the mobster he works for is always insulting him, a neighborhood girl who is hanging out with the bad kids is given an endearing lecture by Rocky about girls who have bad ""reps"" only to have her make an obscene gesture as they part after walking home, and most of all Mick (Burgess Meredith), who runs the local gym, is always yelling at Rocky about what a loser he is.<br/><br/>When it becomes known that Rocky has been given a shot at the title, suddenly people want a piece of him. Mick comes to him and wants to be his manager. Rocky is not stupid. He realizes the difference in treatment is because of the opportunity he has been given, and if not for that people would still be walking on him. The scene between him and Mick where Rocky explodes with resentment is really good acting by Stallone.<br/><br/>So Rocky does ultimately let Mick train him, and the scene of Rocky running after Mick after Rocky at first threw him out of his apartment is shot from a distance, so we never know what was said, and that again is good filmmaking. Rocky takes the whole thing seriously while Creed is too busy with public appearances to train.<br/><br/>In parallel with Rocky's training is his romance with Adrian who transforms from a plain looking girl into a stylish pretty girl. This is one of those obvious things because Talia Shire was not an unknown. She was in the Godfather for Pete's sake, so the audience knows she is not ugly. Just don't style her hair, dress her drably, no makeup and some geeky looking glasses and voila - the ugly duckling. Rocky's unconditional love gives her confidence to dress well and present herself attractively.<br/><br/>So the big day comes, Rocky has done his homework, Creed hasn't really prepared, expecting this to be a three round publicity stunt. Adrian has changed so much that nobody who knew her three months ago could recognize her in a lineup. How does all of this end up? Watch and find out.<br/><br/>I don't think this was the Best Picture of 1976, but it was probably the most upbeat of the A pictures that came out that year. Look at its competition - ""All The President's Men"" which was about Watergate, ""Network"" about a bloodless television executive who will do anything for ratings, ""Taxi Driver"" about a psychologically troubled ex-marine, and ""Bound For Glory"" about a folk singer of the Depression era who died of just about the worst disease on earth. Maybe the Academy just wanted to pick a feel good film, and Rocky was the only one that fit that bill."

","It seems that those movie productions that had to fight the big fight with the expectations, somehow, turned out to be timeless, not only for the fans of the genre but for the general audiences as well. That is, undeniably, the case with ROCKY not yet directed by Sylvester Stallone but by late John G Avildsen (who comes back with the direction of ROCKY V in 1990). ROCKY, after all these years and a lot of sequels made after, including the recent CREED films, proves to be one of the very best films about sport, a sportsman and, most importantly, a personality - formerly 'nobody' rising to the top-notch fame and popularity.<br/><br/>Not being a particular fan of boxing, I am not trying to review this film as an expert relating to some details about it. Indeed, there have been plenty of such reviews before me who praise the way the fight is being filmed here. When I recently re-watched it with my wife, I rather wanted to see it in a fresh way, without all this background knowledge and unnecessary facts what happened later. Just see Rocky as a young man, seemingly 'nobody' an underdog with no perspectives, who lives in a poor district of Philadelphia, in an almost obscure flat (he says that 'his whole place stinks') and yet, is offered a chance of a lifetime - possibility to fight the big fight with the heavy weight champion, Apollo Creed. ROCKY is unique in that determination and the strength he finds within himself because...<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone portrays a man with whom he somehow identifies (that was also the moment in his career - taking a chance that appears once in a lifetime). He has true, genuine motives. His personal motives are powerfully depicted in several scenes, particularly the unforgettable relation with Mickey (played by legendary Burgess Meredith). In the scene of Mick's first visit to Rocky's stinking place, the young boxer opens up his inner self and amidst the rage of his soul, the pain of his mind, he meets a true friend who does not turn his back to him but helps him out and motivates. Mickey understands because he was a boxer himself, he did have his prime and he knows what it is to 'eat lightin' and crap thunder.' Rocky and Mick's relationship is the essence of a tutor and a student, the essence of a good coach who knows the tough rules that are inspiring, astounding, demanding - yet never imposed. This is the power that Rocky finds in himself thanks to Mick who is there to fan the flame of the desire to face the challenge. And he does that truly effectively proving that he 'ain't no bum.' Sometimes, when you watch their scenes, you just seem to forget it is played. It seems so real. Both actors feel their roles tremendously.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone, apart from the tough world of boxing, apart from being the ""Italian Stallion"" he called himself, portrays a truly gentle guy. That is, in a way, something we like about Rocky most. It is not a typical 'macho' pretending to have no feelings. But where can you find this truth about the man if not when facing a woman. ROCKY combines this subtlety with timidness in the scenes with Adrian (played by Talia Shire already known at the time for her supporting role in GODFATHER). Thanks to Paulie (Burt Young) who supplies Rocky with the meat for the boxing sack and the woman for loving, they go for the first date. I loved the scene he takes her to the ice rink. Mind you that this scene somehow forgets about the tough world that is in the background and is a true depiction of some genuine, pure male-female fascination. The two alone on the ice rink resemble a couple alone in the world, just for themselves. Each of their movement, each of the word they say to each other (Rocky appears to be far more talkative) is here to stay in your memory. The moment he takes her glasses off and their first kiss (which was, for Stallone pretty challenging because Talia Shire was having a flu when she was playing the scene), her visit to his flat (at first so shy and hesitating, yet she made up her mind and entered the flat giving him the credit...as he later remembers in ROCKY BALBOA), these are the moments that you really feel as a viewer. As a matter of fact, her style, her clothes indicate this inexperience and that aspect of her personality is something that Rocky is taken with. Their love grows in the following parts, indeed, but it is here when their scenes are unforgettable. Two people outside of the world that imposes certain manners and conventions: ""But it's Thanksgiving. Yeah to you, but to me it's Thursday.""<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone, though he is not the director of this film, proves to know the psychological mechanisms that are behind the wings of the boxing rink. Imagine that Apollo Creed (played by Carl Weathers who, recently in an interview, still remembers this role as one of his key roles of the career) the master is to fight with some 'underdog' who trains on meat and dares say: ""I will fight the big fight"" This is the pride of a champion that is put to test, this is the situation when truly much is at stake. It is good to remember one scene here when Creed talks on TV and says to sportsmen seemingly discouraging simple people from sport: ""be a thinker not a stinker."" This fear of losing wide acclaim is even more visible in ROCKY II but here, the idea behind it all is not merely a sort of 'rematch' but a guy - a 'nobody' daring fight with the widely acclaimed master that Apollo is. Very well played by Mr Weathers and their fight at the end of the movie is something that you can watch in slow motion even admiring every camera shot, every emotion evoked, dwelling in the spirit of competition, yes, but foremost courage.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to review ROCKY and not to mention a word about the very location of the story, the city of Philadelphia. It is no coincidence that Stallone chose this place as the setting of the story: those streets where he is running, those steps that he climbs while training early in the morning, the very background of rising from the bottom. The train that he hears in his small flat, the singing and street parties that he passes (Frank Stallone among the people), the character of Marie whom Rocky discourages from smoking and the kids that leave school and run with Rocky (yes, that is the second part but Philadelphia plays its role in all parts, in particular ROCKY BALBOA where sentiment is combined with the change and new reality).<br/><br/>ROCKY is a lovely film with lovely music. The soundtrack is something that can be listened to for hours all over again being a source of inspiration for training, a source of finding this 'power of spirit' from within yourself, it is relaxing and extremely memorable by itself but also fits best to the scenes. Bill Conti did a terrific job here. The theme song ""Gonna Fly Now"" and ""You Take My Heart Away"" simply have a tremendous impact on the emotions of viewers.<br/><br/>ROCKY is a rather simple story about a simple guy who trains in a simple way and falls in love with a simple woman. Yet, perhaps that is why it is so extraordinary that may prove to stand aside the masterpieces of cinema and dare equal them."
"drqshadow-reviews","10","2","2","22 November 2019"," A Bare, Honest Look at Self-Doubt, Desire and Motivation
","An extremely impressive screenwriting debut for Sylvester Stallone, not to mention a breakthrough acting performance, in this transcendent boxing saga that's more about the path to the ring and the tumultuous effects of both participants' personal lives than the outcome of the fight itself.<br/><br/>Stallone is raw and nuanced as Rocky Balboa, the punchy palooka who wears his heart on the sleeve of his leather jacket and tumbles through life in a barely-contained tailspin. He's awkward but approachable, blunt but genuine. When flanked by an equally flawed supporting cast, we catch Rocky's personality from a number of different angles. Finally granted the long-sought opportunity to date a friend's sister, he's clumsy and oafish. They both are. The climactic moment of their embrace isn't a Hollywood crescendo, met with a romantic orchestral swell, it's a quiet fumble on the cold floor of his ratty, single-bedroom apartment. That's real; that's personal. As a trusted corner man's alcoholism spirals into an incoherent fury, we don't find any easy resolutions. Just added color to an already-bright fabric, portraying life in an American downtown during the mid-'70s.<br/><br/>The film's simple, seat-of-pants production further reinforces that theme. There's no gloss here, no smoothed edges. It's heartfelt and meaningful, bare and earnest, from the quiet moments of self-doubt to the irrelevance of the judges' scorecards at the end of the big match. Great stuff."

","Rocky has become a part of popular culture for so many years its hard to look at the first film as a standalone low budget entry in the boxing genre. This is a great film and put the writer and main lead Sylvester Stallone into the stratosphere of Hollywood. Considering what the Rocky series became - popcorn action films with little heart, less intelligence, and a lot of testosterone - it's a somewhat refreshing experience to go back and re-connect with the original, which offers a lot more substance than the sequels. Rocky is not a flawless motion picture, but it is a feel-good classic, and well worth another look. The basic storyline has been done to death over the years; this is still one of the most effective and successful applications of the formula."

","""Rocky"" (1976) is a professionally produced drama about a struggling boxer, Rocky played by Sylvester Stallone, who gets a ""once in a lifetime"" shot to fight Heavyweight Champion of the World, Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers. This film, even with the occasional technical issues and bad punches, is a wonderous underdog story that brings me joy every time I watch it. I wish this original story would have been made in this era with more attention on the little details as to keep those little pesky nuances from detracting from the story itself. This film is still very much a classic, especially with the need of an uplifting story during that time.<br/><br/>I believe the writer, Stallone, and director, John G. Avildsen, did an immaculate job intertwining both the sport story and the love story between Rocky and Adrian, played by Talia Shire. The editing had moments where it felt a little like it was dragging on, even though it was purposeful, but the ability to effectively display the slow love in contrast to the fast-paced boxing was spot on. This film has a decent number of things that can be criticized which I believe has a lot to do with when it was produced, but overall this film, particularly the story, is a stand alone classic to my whole family."

Rocky is the story of a million to one shot underdog given a chance of lifetime and a shot at something more, and an opportunity to find worth and respect. <br/><br/>The films beautifully unfolds the arc of a man who ultimately finds his worth and finds someone worthy to fight for, love for and live for.

","Rocky was a hugely pleasant surprise for me, as I'm not into boxing at all and often fail to understand people's passion for sport. What I thought would be a standard sports movie ended up being an incredibly well told and wonderfully acted underdog story that has strongly inspired and uplifted me during the hardest times of my life. Sylvester Stallone has appeared in more bad movies than good, but Rocky is up there with his best. Rocky is a surprisingly endearing character, he's tough, not too well-spoken and a little dumb, but he's kind-hearted, loves animals and doesn't demand for much outside of not being seen as a bum. The other characters are excellent too: Adrian, Paulie, Mickey and Apollo Creed are blissfully cast and compliment Rocky well, they all have an important place in the story and the movie simply wouldn't work without them. Many think of Stallone as another generic action movie star, but to me, he's not John Rambo, Barney Ross, Judge Dredd or The Toymaker. He's the guy who inadvertently might've saved my life with this excellent film. He is Rocky."

The whole cast crew gives their most to make you believe it, and you do that. <br/><br/>The steps Sly takes on the way to the final confrontation is very heartful and moving, which of course was the attention.<br/><br/>Fellow actors Burt Young and Talia Shire is excellent all the way.<br/><br/>Accused for stealing a concept from a real heavy-weight fight in 1975, Stallone always denies the Ali-Wepner comparison. (The difference of Rocky almost punch movie champion to the floor; the latter being saved by the bell and then pronounced as the winner by judge decision.)<br/><br/>Real boxer Chuck Wepner gave Ali a real deal to handle, referee didn't blow the whistle until a few seconds left of the 14th.(?)

What I know is you must see it.<br/><br/>Forget the sequels, entertaining though they are, they never recaptured the honesty of the first, they never inspired like the original and they will never be loved like the first.<br/><br/>Rocky is the story of a boxer but boxing isn't what this movie is about. This is depressing and uplifting in equal measure. Rocky Balboa is a bum in every sense of the word. No money, no intellect, no real friends, no love interest, no talent for his beloved boxing (and even then he'll lose if it makes more money) and he has no joy in his job as a loan-sharks's muscle. He has almost nothing.<br/><br/>Almost....but not quite. He has a dream, he has hope and (in addition to all the other things his poorly educated mind doesn't know) he doesn't know what giving up is.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, on the reverse side of the coin is Apollo Creed, the undefeated Heavyweight Champion of the world. He's rich, he's slick, he's blessed with talent and speed, he is surrounded by an admiring entourage and a loving family. Hell, he's never even been take the distance. Apollo Creed has everything, literally everything Rocky dreams of.<br/><br/>Fortune smiles on our eponymous hero and he gets an unlikely shot at the Champ.<br/><br/>Now we see it...Rocky has no head movement to speak of, no jab, no foot movement and he blocks with his face. He's not very good, really and the world can see it. Creed is the antithesis of Balboa...short night's work and an easy payday surely. Balboa, just wants one thing no else has had from Creed. A judges' decision. The final bell, to be standing at the end. To show he isn't just another bum from the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>What we are treated to is a fight not even Micky Ward and Arturo Gatti could have given us.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it I shall leave you to find out how it goes for yourself.<br/><br/>This movie is an all time classic. The ultimate underdog story. Stallone both wrote and starred in the movie he didn't sell until somebody was willing to give him his shot (sound familiar).<br/><br/>Talia Shire is brilliantly timid as Adrian, Burt Young is excellent as Adrian's ne'er do well brother, Paulie and Stallone is superb as Rocky. However, my favourite performances are those of Burgess Meredith & Carl Weathers.<br/><br/>Weathers as Creed is convincingly confident, boorishly braggadocious and looks every inch the pro-boxer. Weathers provides us with an easily a champ who is easily disliked yet grudgingly admired.<br/><br/>Meredith as Mickey is the star of the show for me though. An ageing terrier of a man, rough of voice and harsh of word but kind of meaning. As knowledgeable about boxing as he is old school in his methods. He provides inspiration, perspiration and frustration in equal measure and is a marvel in this role.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic movie with the message that it if brains and education, natural talent and quick wits have failed to bless you you have two choices. Fight or Succumb.<br/><br/>What Rocky teaches us is that while you are alive, you can fight, if you can fight you can land punches and if you land the right one incredible things can happen. If you are prepared to take the hits and keep coming then anything is possible.<br/><br/>Failing? That's OK, it means you're trying."

Each actor perfectly adopts the mindset of each desirous character searching for their own American dream.

Then one day he gets a call from a man who wants to schedule a fight between him and the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World who goes by the name ""Apollo Creed"" (Carl Weathers). At first Rocky refuses because he doesn't believe he is in the same class as the World Champion and doesn't deserve the honor. However, he eventually comes around and gets more serious about his training. But even then he has grave doubts about his chances. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very good movie which really highlights the importance of never giving up and always trying to do your best in spite of the odds. Admittedly, the first hour or so is quite slow but during this time it provides the character development necessary for the intense action and drama in the second hour. This is especially true for Talia Shire (as Rocky's girlfriend ""Adrian"") and the aforementioned Sylvester Stallone. At any rate, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to those who might be interested in a movie of this type."

The first true underdog boxing story with iconic lines scenes and characters has anyone who watches it wanting to run a mile and become the heavyweight champ of the world. The story of nobody to somebody might as well have been invented by this movie. There is nothing that gives me more goose bumps in all of cinema than this movie. From the incredible training scene, capped off by arguably the most famous shot in all of film of Rocky's arms in the air after climbing the steps of the church, to the ending of the fight as when Apollo sees rocky down and thinks he has the fight one only to see rocky get back up and taunt Apollo to fight some more. The incredible writing acting and cinematography in this movie makes it a classic every time you put it on. Ending it with Rocky losing on paper but truly winning in the hearts of the fans and viewers at home was something so original at the time that it was the perfect ending to the most transcendent sports movie ever made."
"tay-sedai","8","2","2","11 December 2015"," A good surprise
","I only saw Rocky for the first time recently, after getting access to Netflix. I know it's been on TV recently and that's partly why I wanted to watch the full movie when I saw it on Netflix. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.<br/><br/>I know since watching this movie that I had been missing at least one important 'cultural reference' that you wouldn't get until you've seen Rocky - that is, him yelling out ""AAaadriaaan!"" which is also a quote in the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (which I also love ;) ).<br/><br/>Stallone's character was surprisingly interesting to me and I thought he was a real sweetie. I found the story compelling too. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's much more than just a boxing movie. I really enjoyed the fact that he went after a girl who was, let's face it, quite dowdy and not your typical love interest in any Hollywood movie. I thought their love story was really sweet, though I could relate to Adrian not wanting to watch him get beaten up in the fight!<br/><br/>One other thing to love about this movie is the classic theme song, too. And I finally got to see what that guy was talking about when I visited Philadelphia as a teenager - the steps Rocky ran up. That was back in 1997 that I saw those steps - I'm glad I finally know what that reference was about!<br/><br/>I haven't seen any of the others as yet, but I know they're available on Netflix. I have a feeling they won't be quite as good as the first, just like I prefer the first Lethal Weapon movie to all the others I've seen."

","This old school movie ended up being a start of an amazing franchise. It's been almost a 40 years and it is still alive and kicking and all thanks to the amazing Sylvester Stallone who fought and bled to star in this movie for which he banged up the script in matter of days. Rocky is an amazing movie which kind of reflects on the life of Sylvester Stallone back in the days. Also for any younger generations as myself who didn't get the chance to watch it back in the 70s I would absolutely recommend it. It's a beginning of a franchise you don't really get to see today. This is 2 hours of your life you will never want back because it's worth every single second of watching it."

","Adolescense. This is a potentially magical time in someone's life. A youth is taught that adulthood will be a time in which all your hard work will pay off. That a successful life is one in which you marry, start a family, find a steady productive job and in doing all of these things a person will find happiness. Many people go down this road with optimism and enthusiasm. At the onset of this journey some elements go well and then reality hits and it hits hard. It becomes more difficult to relate to people around you, professional life is discovered to be a frustrating process and life in general hands a person setback after setback.<br/><br/>It is easy to allow the people around us to affect us on such an intimate emotional level that it is possible to never recover from it. A person may have a strong support group early on though at some point, things in life get taken away and at some point a person may realize that life is not what they thought it would be. It can be very difficult for a person to find the courage to continue on their chosen path.<br/><br/>These messages are the heart, body and soul of the film Rocky. Not only does the titular character have to reach deep inside himself in order to pull himself out of the life of shame and minimization in order to face life's challenges but he also find his own self worth and confidence in order to set his life back on track. In fact all the supporting characters have experienced disappointment or emotional damages in their life that has led them to having a lesser quality of life.<br/><br/>Rocky's girlfriend had been dominated by her older brother all of her life and was just naturally shy. She avoids contact with everybody around her and lives a very isolated life until her brother Paulie forces her to go on a date with Rocky. They find that they are kindred spirits and are then inseparable. She begins to change emotionally when she begins to realize that she can be loved and be loved by someone who will not mistreat her in any way. Her brother Paulie, who spends most of his time between fits of anger or drunken has allowed his life to become absolutely stagnant by settling into a dead end job and forgetting how to take care of himself without Adrian's help and in the end Rocky's.<br/><br/>Finally, Rocky's trainer Mick who has already lived through the prime of his life is aware of his mortality and wants to know that he is still useful.<br/><br/>It is only when a person is stretched to their limit that they have to look within their self and rediscover their self worth. It is the power of self worth and confidence that allows anybody to accomplish anything that brings about positive change. It is positive change that can bring about happiness as a direction in life brings meaning and importance."
"anthony-inhorn","10","2","2","14 November 2014"," The Greatest Film of All Time
","Rocky is my favorite movie of all time, and I consider it to be one of the best ever made, if not the best. This might be a controversial statement, but it's my opinion. There might be movie that are more well made or that got better reviews, but considering what Rocky did on the budget that it had, it shoots past all of them. Rocky tells the story of a down and out boxer named Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone. When the Heavyweight Champion of the world, Apollo Creed, , played by Carl Weathers, gives Rocky the chance to fight him in an exhibition fight, he must prove to the world that he isn't a bum, and win the love of Adrian, played by Talia Shire. This is an incredibly inspiring movie, and if you know what Stallone went through to get this made, it makes the movie even better. Watching this today, almost forty years later, it does look a little dated, But so does any old movie. That doesn't make it worse than movies made today. The acting in this film is extraordinary. Stallone gives an emotional and winning performance. Shire is great as an extremely introverted character. Burt Young is good in the movie, even though his character is unlikeable. Carl Weathers is charismatic. And Burgess Meredith gives an amazing performance as Rocky's grizzled trainer. The script is beautiful, one of the best of all time, and the direction is good, but not earth-shattering. Rocky is required viewing for anyone who loves movies, or really anyone."
"samurott74","10","2","2","10 September 2014"," Why Rocky is the Movie of all time
","Why is Rocky the best movie ever made? I know why, Rocky is a underdog who gets a shot at the big league by fighting the cocky Apollo Creed in a boxing match through the whole movie you grow attached to Rocky as he goes from being some decent south paw boxer to the man who blew everyone away. I love every character in this movie especially Rocky and his trainer Mickey, Mickey is Rocky's coach who is the classic broken down mentor character who even though is old is also very wise he has a lot of wisdom to share with Rocky as he helps him get stronger and readies him to fight Apollo. Then There's Rocky's love interest Adrian who at first is shy and socially awkward opens up to Rocky as we the audience does to, and then there's Adrian's brother Paulie who is a friend of Rocky who always puts Adrian down and later he gets what he has coming to him and although you may see Apollo Creed as the antagonist he's not really a bad guy he's the one who gives Rocky the shot. This entire movie is amazing there's never a boring scene your always on the edge of your seat waiting for the final fight and when it happens your just like what he doesn't win but doesn't lose he just went through all 15 rounds with Apollo but I like this ending most people would be all like OK cliché he's going to win but he doesn't win or lose. That's why I love this movie so much all I can say is go watch your in for a treat."
"Mister_Marklin","10","2","2","27 February 2010"," Rocky - Best boxing movie of all time
","In my opinion, Stallone stars in the greatest boxing movie of all time. Raging Bull, arguably the 2nd, does not even touch it. Stallone is an Italian hack boxer, in the underbelly of Philadelphia's rough boxing scene, fighting over the hill has been's, never-will-be's, and never have been's until his name is almost drawn from a hat, so to speak, by Apollo Creed's (The current world heavy weight champion) management at a time when the boxing world lacks solid contenders and Apollo figures that it will make him more popular with the fans if he gives a nobody a shot, but his manager thinks he might be barking up the wrong tree by picking a south paw that he knows nothing about. Apollo, being a business man, selects Rocky based on his ring name ""The Italian Stallion."" Rocky is in an inner city friend to the Italian Catholic community who stands behind him as he trains on the streets of the bicentennial city, in underground boxing gyms and in a meat locker, where he works for his future brother in law, by punching large slabs of meat into submission, in cold freezers. It's also a story about a simple man, in love with his city, culture, church and a simple girl, Adrien, who is the clerk at a pet shop below his apartment where he shops for turtle food, that he does not need, in order to have conversations with his future wife, who I might add, he never cheats on through 5 Rocky's (Refreshing). It's a blue collar story about the American dream. If you have not seen it, I insist. If you wonder how Sylvestor became a star. Stop wondering. Rent the movie and you will get the answers to your question."
"classicsoncall","10","2","2","2 January 2010"," ""He doesn't know it's a show. He thinks it's a damn fight!""
","One gains a certain degree of perspective with the passage of time, and one of the things I like to do is watch a movie that I saw upon it's original release and compare my feelings for it now to those I experienced back in the day. I thought ""Rocky"" was a great and inspiring movie back in 1976, and with only the slightest bit of hesitation, I think it delivers the same feelings today. I throw in that slight hesitation part because over the years, the sports underdog theme has been worked to death in cinema. But the thing about ""Rocky"" is that it's not so much a film about boxing as it is a film about life in general. A direction-less man with no goals suddenly finds the gold ring handed to him on a platter. Not that there isn't a whole lot of work involved to make that dream come true, but one has to recognize opportunity in the first place. I read with some amusement the negative reviews of the picture on this board and have to wonder how many of the nay-sayers consider themselves so intellectually superior that they trash the film for that simple lack of recognition. Because criticizing Rocky Balboa for talking like he had a mouth full of marbles is missing the point. He talked like that because he was a street punk working as an enforcer for a local mob boss, and the people he dealt with on a daily basis weren't exactly magna cum laude types. Nor was he going up against members of mensa whenever he climbed through the ring ropes at a local boxing joint.<br/><br/>To prove he's not just another bum from the neighborhood, all Rocky wants to do, as he confesses to Adrian (Talia Shire) in that touching apartment scene, is go the distance with the champ. He doesn't have to knock him out, doesn't even have to win, just go the distance. You know, I still have to remind myself at times as I reflect on the picture that Rocky really didn't win the match. But he comes out a winner in the truest sense of the word, and that message blurs out the ring announcer's call of a split decision in favor of Apollo Creed. If there was no ""Rocky II"", (or III or IV or V), I wonder how many of the movie's fans would have been settled with the idea that Rocky Balboa actually became the world champion that day."
"dimp","10","2","2","14 January 1999"," An amazing masterpiece that will never be forgotten
","Probably one of the most amazing movies ever written and directed, Rocky is both a touching and dramatic movie about an up and coming fighter who finally found his will to win and his love for people. An amazing masterpiece of art that everyone should take the time to see."
"Don-102","10","2","2","28 June 1999"," Just Going the Distance is Enough to Make You Somebody...
","Rocky Balboa has become a cultural icon. Stories like ROCKY have been told and re-told time and time again. Rags-to-riches, hero gets the girl, etc., right? Yes, but the way ROCKY is told puts one of my all time favorites many Art Museum steps above the rest. Sylvester Stallone was actually an actor back in the seventies and quite a writer. His raw emotion and presence on-screen makes ""Rocky Balboa"" real and original. The film ironically parallels Stallone's now legendary struggle to get it made his way. Could you imagine Burt Reynolds as ""Rocky""? Me neither. Stallone turned down a lot of money to just take a writing credit but he fought his way to the top and revolutionized the actor-screenwriter dimension of film-making.<br/><br/>ROCKY is as predictable as tic-tac-toe. Who cares? The music, the setting, the characters, and the fight make it the American classic it is. ""Philadelphia's favorite son"" goes through what no fighter in professional boxing could ever possibly imagine. (What world champ would pick a challenger out of a book because of his name?) Director John G. Avildsen puts the exclamation point on Sly's screenplay by isolating the characters and showing their depressingly small world on the dank streets of South Philly. Each performance, especially Burt Young's, is unique. Stallone's yelling match with ""Mickey""(Burgess Meredith), his long-time, ""broken-down pug"" trainer is as powerful as anything Brando did in ON THE WATERFRONT. The movie draws from its cinematic ancestors well. The likes of BODY AND SOUL and SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME are oh so present throughout.<br/><br/>Notice the similarity between Carl Weathers as ""Apollo Creed"" and Muhammad Ali. Pretty close aren't they? This is not accidental. Stallone supposedly saw a fight between Ali and the latest great white hope of the 70's named Chuck Wepner. The two went the distance in 1974 and Stallone immediately had an idea. Several typewriters and notebooks later, he had a story no one wanted to produce. This is the essence of the parallel between art and reality. Stallone became a name and a superstar because of his spirit and fight. He reflects it all rather well in ROCKY.<br/><br/>Boxing is a great sport to make a film about and the most important aspect may be the fight scenes. Of the 5 ROCKY films, the original has the most realistic fight. Stallone, who even choreographed the boxing scenes, has a great feel for the sport and its inner workings, all very essential. The training sequence provides enough motivation for any couch potato watching to get off his or her butt and get in shape. Turn your tube up and hold back the tears as ROCKY fights for his girl, his city, and his name.<br/><br/>RATING: 10 OF 10"
"jamestheklein","2","24","54","20 January 2013"," World's biggest let down? Yes.
","After many years of hearing that this film is great, millions and millions of references made to it in other films and TV shows, and seeing it in multiple ""100 best films ever"" lists, I decided to watch it.<br/><br/>I needn't have bothered. There are some ""classic, must see"" films that are worth seeing, just to be able to claim that you have seen them, such as ""Airplane."" But Rocky is not one such film. It tells the story of a low-level enforcer for a small time loan shark. He makes his money shaking people down and boxing on weekends for a few dollars per fight. He then forces himself on his best friend's sister, punches animal carcasses, and tries to win a fight against the world champion.<br/><br/>For a film about boxing, there is basically none. A few seconds at the beginning, that show that Rocky is a boxer. Then there is nothing until the final few minutes. The film is 116 minutes long. What a joke. <br/><br/>The dialogue? It is dreadful. Rocky's best friend just randomly shouts and goes into massive rage tantrums for basically no reason, Rocky is barely intelligible, and his girlfriend basically says nothing. Apollo Creed is meant to come across as some massive ass hole who only cares about the big show, but whenever he is on screen you barely even pay attention to him enough to notice.<br/><br/>The whole scene where Rocky practically begs Adrienne do come in, then corners her against the wall and forces her to kiss him is one of the most rapey things I have ever seen. They have zero chemistry. <br/><br/>I am just upset that I wasted the time to watch it. The only reason it doesn't get 1/10 is because the day may come when I have to review the sequels, so I need to save that spot."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","7","12","5 June 2005"," Way more than just a sport movie.
","This is easily the best sport movie ever made but the movie is way more than a boxing movie. It's also one of the best drama-movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Reason why ""Rocky"" is a classic is of Sylvester Stallone. Believe it or not, he really deserved that Oscar nomination for best actor. Why? Because he simply IS Rocky. He plays the character so well with so much passion that he can be regarded as one of the best and most memorable movie characters in movie history. The movie is filled with strong solid character, I especially love how the unusual friendship between Rocky and Paulie is portrayed. Talia Shire is also very impressive as shy young woman. The love-story between her and Rocky is done very well and in a believable way.<br/><br/>The movie its main focus is on the drama and only the last 30 minutes of the movie really focuses on the boxing. So really, you don't have to be a boxing fan to like this movie, this movie should be enjoyable and unforgettable for everybody. The story is told in a good slow pace and it pays attention to the character's emotions and struggles. The story of 'underdog' has been much copied ever since in many movies and in many different variations but nothing has ever came close to ""Rocky""'s level.<br/><br/>The music by Bill Conti is also of course unforgettable and is also something that brings the movie to the next level.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is mainly a drama, the best scene's are still the boxing sequence's. They are filmed very well and are very spectacular to watch time after time. You'll simply never get tired of those scene's!<br/><br/>In my opinion a real classic!<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

That's why lots of people find something from theirselves in this movie and in this character. Sylvester Stallone plays his role amazingly. He acts like a loser and boxer. He fits Rocky Balboa character. Also he has made a good job as a writer too. He created a few great supporting characters like Creed and Adrian. Apollo Creed reminds me Muhammed Ali. Also I really liked the way Rocky and Adrian have met and started to dating. Other great things about this movie are its music and low budget. It is not even 1M dollars.
Just admirable."
"ironhorse_iv","9","3","4","19 July 2017"," What a knockout! This underdog boxing film was amazing! It went the distance!
","Opening with a black screen, following by giant white letters, the word, 'Rocky' scrolls across from right to left, accompanied by the iconic theme song 'Gonna Fly Now' from composer, Bill Conti ; this Bi-Centennial sport film, tells the story of a down on his luck, boxer, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) on his quest to achieve success in the boxing world, by accepting, the role of replacement opponent for world champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in an exhibition match in Philadelphia, PA. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while many of film historians & critics, labelled this, as the 'greatest boxing movie of all time'; in truth, this film directed by John G. Avildsen has little fighting in it. When it did, the punches look a bit fake and hokey, despite Stallone and Weathers suffered injuries during the shooting of the final fight; with Stallone suffered bruised ribs and Weathers suffered a damaged nose. Nevertheless, the fight scenes are not really, the heart of the movie. Instead, this film written by Sylvester Stallone works best, when focuses mostly on the titular character, trying to seek the love of a mousy pet store employee, Adrian Pennino (Talia Shire), by proving his own self-worth. If anything, this movie should be label as 'one of the greatest love stories of all time'. Because of this, I wouldn't say, this is action-packed film. The love story takes a big part of the movie, making the fight with Apollo, somewhat secondary. I know, that some people might find this choice in direction, a bit slow paced and somewhat boring, but if you can push through that, you would find yourself, loving the dramatic, more, because how awkward, and real, the love scenes, seemed, between the simple-minded, Rocky and the somewhat recluse, Adrian, even if Rocky is a bit, too dumb to taken serious, while Talia Shire's character, can be a bit off-putting, with her close-minded introvert attitude. It's worth it. You get, a lot of iconic unforgettable scenes like the ice skating sequence & the climatic 'Yo Adrian!' call-out. However, the best scenes in the film, had to be, the training montage. The sequence in Rocky uses meat carcasses as punching bags, and jogs through Philadelphia is very memorable. Yet, the best, out of these training sequences is the scene, where Rocky run up the Philadelphia Museum of Art's flight of stairs. It got so famous, that tourists, around the world, often mimic Rocky's famous climb, as a metaphor for an underdog or an everyman rising to a challenge. The site also got Rocky statue, situated just northeast of the steps as a memorial. Nevertheless, one of the most common misconceptions about this movie, is that, Rocky's trainer, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) help Rocky, train for his fight. In truth, most of that training, including the infamous 'catch the chicken' scene was, in 1979's 'Rocky II"". In this film, Mickey barely does anything, but make Rocky's life, a living hell. So, don't bring up, your hope, in, seeing them, connect with each other. As for other supporting characters, like Paulie (Burt Young). He was alright, but his character hasn't yet, became the famous comic relief, that he would become, in later movies. In this, he just a big fat jerk, most of the time, who doesn't know, if he wants to hook up Rocky with his sister or not. It's a bit confusing. As for Apollo Creed, Weathers really has the charisma to pull this role, off. I really don't think, the movie's original choice, real-life boxer, Ken Norton, could do this. As for the main character, Rocky, I really couldn't see, anybody else, playing the role besides Stallone, because how much Rocky mirrors his real-life. However, I do have to say, the original choice, James Caan does look the part of a fighter when, parodying himself, in 1976's 'Silent Movie'. He was very close, in becoming the title character, before the studio took a chance with Stallone in the lead role. Nevertheless, I still think, every actor in this movie, played their roles to the fullest, despite how mean-spirited, their characters, were, even the cameos from real-life, boxer, Joe Frazier. However, I do have to say, some supporting characters were a bit, pointless. A good example is little Marie (Jodi Letizia) who pretty much, disappears for the rest of the life, after Rocky's life talk. Her character doesn't really come back, until, much later, in the sequels. So, what was the point of having her!? It's filler. It's weird, that this movie won, Best Editing & Best Screen writing at the Oscars, that year, but they kept scenes like that. They really could had cut her from the movie. Anyways, I still kinda glad, the film script was somewhat influence by a real-life fight, between journeyman boxer, Chuck Wepner against controversial, charismatic, and overconfident champion Muhammad Ali. I just kinda wish, Wepner didn't take it, so personal. There wasn't no need to file a lawsuit with Stallone for an undisclosed amount. Rocky acts and looks nothing like him. Anyways, with its Cinderella 'feel-good' crowd-pleasing story, 'Rocky' was the highest-grossing film of 1976. The film was nominated for ten Oscars and won three, including best picture; which 'Rocky' became the first sport film to do. The film also spawned six sequels: Rocky II (1979), Rocky III (1982), Rocky IV (1985), Rocky V (1990), Rocky Balboa (2006), and Creed (2015), the latter a Spin-Off about Apollo Creed's son, with hit and misses results. Nevertheless, overall: Despite some goofs in production, this low-budget movie was indeed, a huge hit for me. It's a movie, I will watch, time and time, again. I highly recommended seeing it. It's worth going to the distance for."

","Sure, there have been worse films than ""Rocky."" But probably none that has become such a cultural icon, that consistently makes ""Best of"" lists, and that so many people are on record as calling ""one of the greatest movies ever made."" Flabbergasting!!<br/><br/>Everything about this film makes me gag. Start with Stallone, a man who has (to quote the gang at Mystery Science Theater in a different context) ""the acting skills of a seriously injured box turtle."" (I could add ""with a speech impediment."") The characters are of the thinnest grade of cardboard, leaving even decent actors such as Talia Shire floundering helplessly in an effort to bring some realism and conviction to a role where none is possible. The best actor in the film, Burgess Meredith, ends up playing Burgess Meredith. <br/><br/>The plot is the kind of cliché worthy of a couple of 7-year-olds playing boxing in their backyards. (""Let's pretend you're the champion boxer and I'm some guy nobody's heard of who gets to fight you!"") The only plot ""twist"" is having the bout end in a split decision instead of a knockout for the underdog. I'd have been a lot more impressed with the film had Rocky gotten the snot beaten out of him in the first round---more realistic, more thoughtful, and shorter.<br/><br/>The theme music is perfect for this film: a bunch of musical clichés strung together over a pounding rhythm track.<br/><br/>Have I left anything out? Nothing worthwhile, certainly, because there's nothing worthwhile in this movie to begin with. Not the worst film ever made, but by far the most overrated."

A two-bit boxer from Philadelphia (Sylvester Stallone in an Oscar-nominated role) gets a chance at the heavyweight title and just wants to go the distance with the champion (Carl Weathers) to prove to everyone and himself that is not the loser that he appears to be.  Rocky is motivated by only one thing: a local shy girl named Adrian (Talia Shire, also Oscar-nominated) who he has fixations on.  Her brother, Pauly (Burt Young, Oscar-nominated), is one of the few real friends that Rocky has.  For Rocky to do his best he is going to need a trainer.  Enter Mickey, (Burgess Meredith, in yet another Oscar-nominated role), who is a man who sees a bit of himself in the young fighter and realizes that this is his last chance at achieving the dreams of his youth.  Overall ""Rocky"" is one of those films which is near impossible to say anything negative about.  It is far from a perfect film, but its parts together make it an unbelievable motion picture.

"Robert_duder","10","4","7","26 December 2006"," Unmatched, brilliant, an absolute masterpiece of cinema history
","Many wonder how Sylvester Stallone got his film career but anyone who has truly seen and loved ""Rocky"" knows exactly how. Stallone created and wrote the entire story and character of Rocky Balboa, who turns out to be one of the great cinema characters of all time and even though as a kid I always loved the sequels even more than the original...looking back nothing compares to this original classic where Stallone completely embodies this 'underdog' character. Rocky is so incredible lovable and relate-able and you just can't get enough and you become so completely fascinated with his life and his romance and everything he has done to fight his way to the top that by the time the match comes about you are practically on your feet rooting for him. Add to that the gritty, and melancholy setting of Philladelphia projects that begin to feel just like home as it is for Rocky. Stallone has always said that 'Rocky' was more than anything else a love story between him and Adrien and it really is now that I watch it for the purpose of reviewing it. Everything that happens in his life is for her and he adores her and his simple minded, laid back manner mixed with his brute strength and determination is unparalleled in films.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone not only wrote the screenplay but takes the infamous lead as Rocky Balboa. It might be one of the greatest performance I have ever seen because Stallone IS Balboa, no one could EVER replace him in this role. He has the personality, and the little things that make Rocky so real and so incredibly likable. He is the most unlikely hero and yet at the same time one the greatest heroes. I don't know how he wasn't awarded the Oscars who was nominated for (Two one in acting and one in writing that year) but it was sheer robbery because he was amazing!! But don't count out this incredible ensemble cast including Talia Shire as the shy and constantly changing Adrian Pennino, who goes through an incredible metamorphosis in personality and life style as she falls in love with this rough around the edges fighter who never gives up...especially on her. Shire never quite captured the original spirit she put into her performance as Adrien. Burt Young also never did such an amazing job as he did with his original performance as brash, violent, outspoken and alcoholic brother of Adrien, Paulie. He is one of the most memorable supporting characters and his performance is brilliant. Burgess Meredith is a classic performer in his role as angry, tough as nails trainer Mickey Goldmill who treats Rocky like crap but only in the end to show it's for his own good. Meredith complements Stallone's soft spoken and non-confrontational Rocky. And Carl Weathers is amazing as Rocky's ultimate foe, the best of the best in professional boxing and basically the polar opposite of Balboa's personality Apollo Creed. Creed is loud, and flamboyant and fast and conceited and on top of that all he really has the skill. Weathers looks like a true pro in the ring and makes it all look like a real fight.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about that fight. Every Rocky film builds up to ""THE FIGHT"" but nothing compares to the build up for that original fight against Creed and when it finally breaks it's like everything else stops. You move to the edge of your seat, you yell at the screen, you cheer and cringe and every move is brilliantly choreographed. No real life boxing fight could ever be as intense as Creed and Balboa bashing it out like two men with desire like no other fighters. The fight is what brings tears to my eyes every single time this film makes me cry!! If the rest of the film is a 7 the fight alone rages it up to a 10/10. But the rest of the film is not a 7, it's such a vital part of the entire story and understanding everyone and it does unfold a little slowly but every piece is so meticulously and brilliantly created. And I can't conclude without mentioning the score. The music is something Rocky is also famous for and that Academy Award nominated song is enough to bring tears to your eyes just listening to it. This entire film is brilliant and classic and if you're reading this and have never seen it you have no idea what you're missing. It's one of the most subtly brilliant and entertaining films of all time, hands down. 10/10"
"austininsonoma","10","4","7","22 December 2006"," In all honesty, one of the best movies of all time.
","I'm not going to attempt to explain how much i love this film. I may honestly be the biggest Rocky fan there is. I don't have a room filled with posters and Rocky coffee mugs. I don't know Stallone's shoe size or any stuff like that. But that's not what a true fan is. A true fan is someone who appreciates the movie more than most do. Every time i watch this film i'm reminded of just how much it means to me. By far, it's my favorite movie.<br/><br/>What people have to say about Rocky have become clichéd statements. Not because they are, but because when dealing with a movie like this, that's really the only way you can sound. And to me, that makes it all the more impressive. When all you can say about a movie is who inspirational it is. Or how it truly grasps the human spirit, that shows how great of a film it is. <br/><br/>Rocky is so much more than a fighting movie. It doesn't do justice to it to even call it that. It's a movie that so beautifully defines the human spirit, that it's overwhelming to watch. It does what so many B movies tried to do and it does it without being corny or over preachy. It's an unfathomable movie which really should be recognized as a statute in film history.<br/><br/>A lot of people poke fun at Stallone's acting carrier, but in this movie it's unlike anything i've ever seen. And i've seen a lot. Stallone was nominated for best actor and best screenplay and there's no doubt in my mind he was cheated out of a much deserved Oscar. His performance is so real and indescribably touching that it's hard to imagine there's a camera in front of him. The rest of the cast is also great. More than great. Burt Young, Tila Shire, and Burgess Merideth were all nominated for Oscars and in my opinion they all clearly deserved to win. Well, between Merideth and Young, i'd have to give it to Merideth, but it's very close. <br/><br/>I'm fully aware of how cliché it sounds, but Rocky is a movie which captures the human spirit. It inspires you to keep moving ahead. Against all odds, in your darkest moments of despair you have to pull yourself together and keep going. We all have a chance in this life to do what we aspire to and no matter how large or small that chance may be, it exists. And it's worth fighting for. <br/><br/>That's what Rocky embodies, and it does so beyond all expectations."

","Rocky is the best movie ever made. I first heard of this movie in 1999 when I was at a friends house but did not watch Rocky as I disliked boxing. In December 2004, I saw this movie at cable TV because there was not any other show on TV. At the end of the movie, when Rocky lost to Apollo Creed, I was emotionally touched. Then I realized Rocky was the best movie in the world. Soon after, I checked about Rocky over the Internet and found out about other Rocky series. I bought them all in a DVD set. I began liking boxing and started to train to be a mid-weight boxer. Today I am a mid-weight boxer. The Rocky series touched my heart and inspired me to work harder if a lose any fight. My life has changed ever since I watched Rocky. All my friend are influenced by me and they are a Rocky fanatic just like me. I am looking forward for the making of Rocky 6 if anyone ever makes that movie. I sure hope there will be a Rocky 6. For anyone out there who wishes to be a good boxer or have lost will and spirit in any aspect, please watch ROCKY, it will change your life forever. God bless everyone and I hope the movie Rocky will inspire others to a better life.<br/><br/>ROCKY Rocks!!!"

","""Rocky"" both starts and ends in the boxing ring. We first see Rocky, Sylvester Stallone,in the ring fighting journeyman boxer Spider Rico, Pedro Lovell. After getting illegally butted by the Spider a mad and outraged Rocky pounds him into the ring and into defeat. <br/><br/>Pushing 30 and with his best fighting days behind him Rocky works on the Phillie docks as a collector for local mob boss Gazzo, Joe Spinelli, to make ends meet. Even as that, collecting mob debts, Rocky is too kind and good natured, a real softy, to break peoples arms legs and thumbs who are late in paying up. With his life set as a low level hood, thats just what Rocky is a mob enforcer, and washed up as a professional boxer he had nothing to look forward to in the future. Meanwhile the World Heavyweight Champ Appolo Creed, Carl Weathers, is out of opponents to defend his title against and needs a new act to attract a big crowd for his next payday in the ring. Appolo and the top promoter in the world of boxing Jergens, Thayer David, come up with this great idea that to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the United States, in 1976. Why not defend his championship against one of the descendent's of the man who discovered America Italian navigator Christopher Columbus. <br/><br/>All at once the bleak future that was staring wash-up broken down club fighter Rocco Balboa became the once in a lifetime chance for proud Italian-America Rocky Balboa to show the world that he's not the bum or has been. Which everybody in the local boxing circles in Philidelpia thinks of him With the exception of his trainer Micky, Burgess Meredith. Rocky goes on the prove in the movie that he's a champ today as the champ that he always was of days past but never knew it. <br/><br/>Stirring boxing film about the rags to riches story of a nobody, Rocky, who became a somebody in the ring against the heavyweight champ with nothing more then the guts and determination and those who stood behind him throughout the entire ordeal. Rocky trains and works himself into a championship caliber boxer to fight the fight of his life. Even in the end when he lost a close fifteen round decision to Appolo Creed he won not only the hearts but the respect of the whole boxing world as well as the world itself.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone has never been able to top himself since he stared in ""Rocky"" and I doubt that he ever will. ""Rocky"" is a truly once in a lifetime movie and Stallone had just one once in a lifetime movie and he already used up his ""Rocky"". As good as the fight scenes are the movie is even more heart lifting and touching with Rocky's actions out of the ring. Micky who at first humiliated Rocky in public when he threw him out of the locker room and later wanted to train and manage Rocky for the big fight with Appolo and get the chance, like Rocky, to be a champ. Rocky after telling the old sick man off and practically throwing him out of his apartment runs out to apologizes for what he did and then accepts his offer and lets bygones be bygones between him and Micky. This was so effectively done with no duologue at all but you'd have to be dead or blind not to see and understand it. <br/><br/>Rocky's feelings for Adrian, Talia Shire, was even more effective then any of Rocky's fight sequence in the movie. The shy Adrian who was considered by everyone including her drunk and bitter brother Paulie, Burt Young, a loser like Rocky. With Rocky's kind and sweet attention towards Adrian showed that she was as beautiful when she got over her insecurities as he was, when he got his confidence back, brave and courageous in the ring against the worlds undefeated Heavyweight Champ Appolo Creed. <br/><br/>Working himself into shape with a tremendous uplifting sequence, to the movies theme song ""Gonna Fly Now"", of Rocky hitting the speed and heavy bag doing one-handed push-ups and running his heart out along the docks crowded streets and railway yards of Phillie. Rocky finally at the end of his long run makes it to and climbed up the steps, two at a time, of the massive Philidelphia Museum of Art. Which earlier in the movie he after doing his morning roadwork almost collapsed on. Rocky was now ready for his place in movie history in his battle with World Heavyweight Champ Creed in the city of Philadelphia.<br/><br/>Everyone involved in the film ""Rocky"", Stallone Weathers Shire Young Meridith Spinlli etc. etc., their lives and their worlds would never ever be the same again."

","I went to see this movie when it came out. I had never heard of Sylvester Stallone and had no expectations or preconceptions other than it was supposed to be a good depiction of boxing. I hated it when I walked out of the theater in 1976, and I hate it even more now. The film is one of sappiest pieces of melodramatic tripe I've ever seen. Every character is a stereotype, and every turn of its derivative, amateurish plot can be anticipated from 50 miles away. Now for the boxing -- a Popeye cartoon has more realistic action. It rivaled the most ludicrous exhibitions staged in professional wrestling matches, and any combatant who endured two minutes of the kind of pummeling depicted in the title fight would be brain dead. My contempt for this trash reached even greater depths when I watched it beat out three outstanding movies -- Network, Taxi Driver, and All the President's Men -- for the best picture Oscar (I've never seen Bound for Glory, but I have no doubt it was also a far better movie than this drivel). I can somewhat understand that a portion of the public would enjoy Rocky, but I can find no excuse for the voting of the Academy members. Shame on them for elevating this sorry excuse for a movie above such worthy contenders. It makes about as much sense as a punch-drunk bar-fighting buffoon landing a title fight with Muhammad Ali."

","OK, let's get the basic review out of the way: a pretty good movie, not great, not worthy of all the hype or awards, but not bad. I just want to focus on one point: the use of my least favorite cliché in all of moviedom.<br/><br/>It's about the girlfriend, Adrian. The ugly duckling ""loser"" woman who nobody wants (but Rocky). Except that, she's actually a cute woman. How is she unattractive? The dumbest, most over-used cliché ever: she wears an absolutely hideous pair of glasses. Then, at just the right moment, the hero makes her take them off, and, voilà! She's instantly nice looking! What makes it particularly egregiously dumb in this movie is, after that point, SHE NEVER WEARS THE GLASSES AGAIN. Apparently, her vision problems magically disappear or something. Or her eyes were always 20/20, but she just liked wearing hideous glasses? (and don't tell me she got contacts, in that day and age, in that socio-economic class, with that obnoxious brother). It's just insulting to our intelligence."

","***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br/><br/>This is probably one of the best movies ever done and considering the low budget it is even more wonderful what a talented scriptwriter like Sylvester Stallone can do.<br/><br/>Although the movie starts with a fight, the whole story is about sacrifice, desperation and hope of a new life for a Philadelphia local guy of Italian-American ancestry called ""Rocky"" Balboa.<br/><br/>His struggle through life will inspire millions of people not only now but also in the next centuries. I learned when I saw this movie that freedom is the most important thing. Freedom brings opportunities for everyone and freedom allows anyone to take the opportunity and success.<br/><br/>Like Apollo Creed a smart American patriot says, America is the land of opportunity, so he decides to give a chance to an unknown boxer to fight for World Championship. <br/><br/>Rocky Balboa is a kind guy that when he falls in love with a shy woman he is able to be very sweet and gentle. He gives advice to any kid there is in the street and helps whenever it's necessary.<br/><br/>The characters of Paulie and Mickey are terrific. As well as Mr Gazzo, that makes one of the best performance in cinema history. And Talia Shire, what can I say, she does excellent. All four of them deserve the biggest congratulations for their important role in making this movie so great.<br/><br/>This is my favorite scenes' list: <br/><br/>1- When Rocky gets up a at 4:00 am and goes jogging through the frozen streets of Philadelphia. I can feel that terrible cold even when I watch the movie in summer.<br/><br/>2- When Mickey goes to Rocky's shabby apartment and offer him to be his manager and coach. That conversation they have between each other is one of the best things ever done in cinema history.<br/><br/>3- When Rocky starts walking alone in the street after he shouted: I assure you I'll break your thumbs!!!! when he was called ""meat bag"" by Mr Gazzo's driver.<br/><br/>4- When Rocky goes running through the alley where there is a crowd of people looking at him and someone throws an orange to him and Rocky takes it.<br/><br/>5- When after knocked down by Apollo he gets up with unbelievable stamina just because of his pride, his indomitable attitude, his strength, his determination to ""GO FOR IT"". And Adrian stares at him with a lovely glance. <br/><br/>All in all the soundtrack, the original music, is a masterpiece of modern art. Bill Conti, from USA, will be honored for ever by this phenomenal and brilliant music, during the training, the combat and the ending credits.<br/><br/>The smart patriotism of Apollo Creed, Rocky hitting the meat on TV, the shabby restroom with just a small piece of mirror... There're plenty of unforgettable details in this movie.<br/><br/>Finally I only can say that the best thing you can do is watch this movie.<br/><br/>Fernanda Monteiro, Lisboa, Portugal"

"robb_772","8","3","5","4 May 2006"," The original still packs a mean punch
","I cannot tell you how many people make fun of me for loving this movie. Never mind the fact that it was the top grossing film of 1976, and won a whole slew of industry awards, including the highly coveted Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. Perhaps it is the eventual deterioration of Sylvester Stallone's career (I still sympathize with the mental anguish that anyone who saw 1995's JUDGE DREAD in it's entirety suffered), or maybe it's the endless series of glitzy sequels and imitations that the film inspired (which did become numbing), but, for whatever reason, the reputation of this film seemed to get permanently soiled along the way. This is a shame, because ROCKY remains possibly the best underdog romance ever.<br/><br/>After years of glossy sequels, it's a bit amazing in retrospect how grim and downtrodden much of the film feels. There is a moving aura of sadness and desperation that hangs over the majority of the film's characters, as if they all realize that they have wasted much of lives and are running out of time. Though he has (perhaps deservedly) become the butt of hundreds of jokes over the years, Sylvester Stallone (who also penned the film's screenplay) has undeniable charisma and displays mega-watt star power in this picture. Many people may forget this now, but many respected film critics actually compared Stallone to a young Marlon Brando when the film originally opened, and that high form of praise is rarely dispensed if undeserved.<br/><br/>The remainder of the cast is similarly winning, particularly the quiet strength of Talia Shire, long before she became a punch-line on the sitcom ""Friends."" So many film romances have used the tired plot device of the ugly ducking who becomes beautiful by the film's finale, but Shire truly does make the transition from a put-on wallflower to a beauty right in front of our very eyes. Her transformation is so truly convincing that it makes the cliché seem fresh. The sister of director Francis Ford Coppola, Shire still acts today (most in bit and supporting parts) with considerable regularity, but I would love to see her tackle another lead role again in the future.<br/><br/>Inspired by Mohamad Ali, Carl Weather's Apollo Creed is appropriately energetic and arrogant, while Burt Young's despicable leach of a brother is so unsympathetic that you actually start to like him about halfway through the film. Best of all is Burgess Meredith, whose short-tempered trainer could have ventured into unbearable campiness, but Meredith's fiery hostility is interlaced with considerable nuance. All these individuals seem less like film characters and more like real people, a feeling that is enhanced by the pseudo-docudrama style in which John G. Avildsen directs. And that, in and of it's self, is a far cry from all the glossy sequels that followed."

","This is truly an all American excellent movie! To know that this production was not only in on film, but also in real life, a ""win or lose"" project for the then unknown Sylvester Stallone only makes this film more lovable. It tells the story of a unknown prize fighter who doesn't really have a life worth envying. Suddenly he gets his big chance when the world champion seeks a new challenger, as the challenger he had has to bail out, due to an injury. Rocky goes for it, but in the end he knows he's not in the same league as the champ. The true victory is Rocky's new gains self respect and love for his girlfriend Adrian. This film has a really cool 70's vibe and for me the locations use (Philadelphia) fit the film perfect. It was filmed during winter 1976 and that's something you can actually see. The true realism and great acting performances (plus the unforgettable soundtrack) makes this a film worthwhile. A must see definitely!! My favourite scene is still the one where Rocky goes out for his first morning run. He gets up at 4 A.M. and sets out into the cold, frozen streets of morning hour Philadelphia. The mood, music and the winterish landscape of a city frozen up are brought to the screen with such a transparant touch.. It still chi lls my skin everytime I watch it! If you haven't seen this one, shame, shame shame!!! Go out and rent or (even better) buy the DVD! One of the best American films of the 1970's (and that's something no one can deny)!"

","Now that I've seen it again, I gotta wonder how in the world did this movie beat Taxi Driver, All the President's Men, Network, and Bound for Glory, or most other films released that year. True, I haven't seen any of those movies, but I'm sure they're better than this cheeseball flick.<br/><br/>To begin, the movie is dull for the most part. It follows around Balboa through his plainly ordinary life with plainly ordinary shots, and painfully bad dialogue. The acting ain't much better either. Every character in the movie is a caricature, and none of the actors do anything to raise them above that status. Sylvester Stallone's Rocky is the mindless thug with a heart of gold. Despite the fact that he part times as hired muscle for a loan shark, he practically walks around with a halo and choir throughout the rough streets of Philly. Adrian (Talia Shire) is a mousey shut-in, pure and chaste, who does nothing to show why Rocky would be so into her. Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is a cocky, disinterested imitation of Muhammed Ali, Burgess Meredith's Mickey is practically a cartoon character, and there is no scene that Burt Young can't ruin with his ham-handed, oafish, stereotypical portrayal of Adrian's brother Paulie.<br/><br/>The movie tries hard, reeeeeally hard to get us to care about the underdog Rocky and his lady-love Adrian. Their made for each other, you know? Nevermind that they're first kiss gives off creepy date rape vibes, they're sweet, especially since she seems mildly retarded. That this film has achieved full-on Spike TV guy movie status is kinda baffling, giving how slow and sentimental it is. You figure that it must be the boxing scenes that redeem it and stand out in the collective guy mind, but then the climactic boxing match between the Italian Stallion and Apollo Creed begins, and you realise that it kinda blows.<br/><br/>First off, there are waaaaaaaay too many punches thrown for the early rounds of a heavyweight fight. These things are dances, not slugfests. But, hey, that's okay since this is the action sequence, bring on the violence! Except... that after the brief flurry at the beginning, the movie just skips through most of the fight, a few seconds of round eight, a spit-take from round 11, then the obligatory cut scene to begin round 14 (where the cutman cuts Rocky, not a scene that didn't make the movie). It's ridiculous really, since all of Apollo's pre-fight hype involved him knocking out Rocky in three rounds, and then they skip past the third round. WHO IN THE HECK SETS UP A MOVIE LIKE THAT? And, better yet, who in the heck awards such a movie Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Film Editing? But, the entire movie wasn't a loss for me. Eventually, the big thug won me over (or wore me down), and I looked past how one dimensional he was. I've always been a big fan of his monologue scene before the big fight, where he admits to Adrian that he's nothing more than a bum, but if he could just go the distance with Creed, not beat him, but go the distance, than maybe he'd be something more than a bum. It's still a great scene (albeit cheapened by the sequels where the unpolished fighter beats a better prepared Creed and goes on to be unstoppable). And, when Rocky was training, pounding the beef, drinking the raw eggs, and running the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, I got chills. He's Gonna Fly Now, darnit! But, all in all, not a good movie. I'll give some of the weaker visual sequences a bit of a pass, since it was made for only about $1.1 million dollars, which also explains why some of the performances aren't up to snuff, since they didn't have that many takes (my favourite scene, the aforementioned monologue, was done in one take). But the budget doesn't account for the overall cheesiness of the flick, or the film's treatment of the final climactic battle as an afterthought."

","Rocky is the consummate boxing movie. But it's also the story of a man who had pretty much wasted his life. Sylvester Stallone's boxer has thick head and a good heart. He depends on other to kind of look out for him. Unfortunately, he has worked with crooks because it's the only living he knows. He does hard manual labor. He likes to box and because he is intense, he catches the eye of the world champion. He gets a gig as a sparring partner and eventually a fight with the champ, Apollo Creed. Of course, it's a circus. Because Rocky is not bright, Creed is able to abuse him emotionally. Rocky is a bruiser, taking as many hits as he gives. Not a good way to have a future. There are subplots, involving MIck (Burgess Meredith) and Pauley (who is disrespectful of his sister Adrian) and then there is the romance developing between Rocky and Adrian. What happens is that Creed thinks Rocky is a joke while Rocky begins to train seriously for the first time in his life. What eventually happens is one of the best choreographed fights in all of cinematic history. A masterful movie."

","Seeing this again for the first time since it was in theaters 35 years ago, I realized this is a very odd film. A strange blend of low budget 1970s street grittiness and realism, and low-brow Hollywood fantasy and cliché. <br/><br/>I appreciate the bittersweet ending, much of the writing, and some of the acting (Burgess Meredith), as well as the very well done fight choreography. <br/><br/>But other moments come off as amateurish improvisation, over the top performances, and old- fashioned hokum (e.g. Talia Shire's absurd physical transformation from over-the-top uber- nerdette, to sexy young love interest). <br/><br/>Still, enjoyable and fun, if not quite the great film I remember it as."
"jzappa","7","2","3","6 May 2011"," An Involving Movie In the Face of Its Otherwise Hackneyed Substance
","American cinema in the 1970s was marked by the new generation of filmmakers' bombshell of originality, liveliness, sexuality and a fervor for the artistic importance of film itself, with a pervading emphasis on realism, subversive political themes and sexual candor. But what won Best Picture in the year of Taxi Driver, Network and All the President's Men---the legendary arguable masterpieces of three of contemporary cinema's finest directors---is this paint-by-numbers inspirational sports flick. Stallone's screenplay is the most wholesome 1930s Hollywood fantasy. It's the tale of Rocky and his girl Adrian, when he, because of conditions too irrational to go into, is given the chance to fight the world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, fashioned after Muhammad Ali so sketchily as to be a practically senseless misuse of character. It's not sufficient enough to even be defamation, but by making the Ali-like fighter such a garish fool, the film treads regions of undeveloped racism that might not be all that undeveloped.<br/><br/>There are intermittent twinklings that the film may be condescending to the subordinate end of the proletarian attitude, as much if not more than the characters who continue putting Rocky down, like Gazzo's bodyguard and the (black) boxer who taunts Rocky after usurping his locker. Then again, Avildsen is known for creating such indistinctness with films he made before such as Joe---which dealt with what mainstream film hadn't yet dared about the neutral depiction of overt racists, junkies and gritty urban living---and the great Save the Tiger, which punctured stereotypes and sought longingly and urgently for answers to the seeming moral predicaments of modern times. Rocky is a devolution of that thread.<br/><br/>However, there are some extremely fine actors in other supporting parts. Burt Young is convincing as Rocky's best friend, a drunk jerk, as is a both deservedly Oscar-nominated and very underused Burgess Meredith as Rocky's antiquated trainer. It's actually Shire who comes off the best, Coppola's sister and Connie in his Godfather saga. She's a genuine actress, truly moving and also droll as a budding bachelorette who comes behind schedule to sexual life. She's so effective, actually, that she almost adds credence to Stallone's performance, which is frankly way too goofy. (I keep getting the impulse to mock him out loud in that mongoloid exaggeration of Italian-American brute brogue.) So Rocky, by day, is a petty debt collector for a neighborhood loan shark played by Joe Spinell. Rocky's the kind of character who evinces his genuine compassion by thinking twice about breaking a stakeholder's thumb. At night, as we all by now very well know, chases a substandard boxing career in rundown sporting rings. But consider when Shire sits, crying and furrowed, in a corner of her small bedroom. Her brother has wrecked the living room with a baseball bat. Rocky, the guy she has become smitten by, enters. She timidly asks him if he wants a roommate. ""Absolutely,"" he says, which is precisely what he should say, and how he should say it, and why Rocky is such an involving movie despite its otherwise ultimately stale framework."
"abooboo-2","9","2","3","4 January 2011"," Stallone's Rocky revisited
","I first saw Rocky in the theater when I was a little kid back in the 1976 and remember liking it, though being a bit bored during the whole Adrian romantic subplot. If it inspired me to want to be a boxer, which it no doubt did for many young boys of that era, it soon got swamped in my imagination by more kid-friendly fodder like Star Wars, War Games, and Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>Like all classic movies it's easy to take Rocky for granted. But watching it again this weekend I was reminded that it is an extraordinary film. Never mind that Stallone has not come close to repeating its success (artistically) since then and his name has long ago become a punch line. His screenplay for Rocky is exquisite, and his performance unforgettable. It's no wonder that critics compared him to a young Marlon Brando. And in fact, Rocky has much in common with Brando's similarly iconic Terry Malloy in On The Waterfront. A couple of boxing bums wrestling with redemption.<br/><br/>It's funny how unreliable memory can be. For the last, oh, 30 years or so, I've been operating on the assumption that, of course, Rocky won his first epic fight with Apollo Creed by knocking him out in the last round. So I was shocked to discover that it actually ends in a split decision. I was also amazed that Rocky is in reality a gritty, soulful, kitchen-sink drama bookended by two boxing bouts which has more in common with Paddy Chayevsky's Marty, for instance, than other underdog sports films such as director John Avildsen's later The Karate Kid.<br/><br/>There are so many smart, pitch-perfect, gutsy little choices in Stallone's screenplay where he pours honest emotion and breathes real life into scenes instead of following some stale formula. The long take of him staring slack-jawed at the picture in the mirror of himself as a boy. No words, just the soul-searching look on his face and the silent eloquence of his sorry apartment all around him. Another long take of him dragging himself out of bed before dawn, cracking precisely six raw eggs into a glass and gulping it down. (Is that really healthy? Doesn't matter. You buy it because it's sold so well.) Then willing his tired bones out the door and lumbering around Philadelphia in what passes for a morning jog. The pet-shop scenes where he babbles like a lovestruck schoolboy at the virtually unresponsive Adrian. Huffing after ice-skating Adrian in the otherwise empty rink in his loafers, the ill-tempered owner counting down the lousy 10 minutes he grants them off-screen as Rocky desperately attempts to make a connection with her. (It would have been so easy to have Rocky lusting after some beautiful blonde, or perhaps trying to reform a sexy stripper or hooker, but, no, he chooses mousy, introverted Adrian. I didn't get it when I was a kid, but I get it now. They match. They ""fill each other's gaps."") Another long, quiet take of Rocky alone in the giant empty arena the night before the fight. (Note to screenwriters everywhere: don't be afraid of strategically placed long takes, even wordless ones – they can accomplish just as much as dialogue, often more).<br/><br/>But the most extraordinary scene is between Rocky and grizzled, miserable old trainer Mick in Rocky's apartment. Mick finds out Rocky is getting the chance to fight Apollo, knows he's been a bastard to Rocky all these years, but pathetically tries to make nice so he can share a bit of the limelight as Rocky's trainer. Rocky resents the hell out of the two-faced little front runner for it, but grudgingly hears the old man out. He bites his tongue, tries to hold his emotions in check, until Mick gets the message that he's not wanted and exits. And then Rocky erupts in an electrifying tirade, unleashing all the hurt feelings and blows to his pride he's kept inside for years in the now empty apartment while Mick listens meekly at the bottom of the stairs. But it doesn't end there, lamely and predictably, with the underdog more determined than ever to go it alone. If Rocky is going to have a shot, any shot at all, with Creed, he knows he NEEDS Mick. Pride be damned. He races after Mick and catches up to him at the end of the street in a beautiful, silent, unbroken long shot. An arm around the shoulder. A handshake. I've done my venting. All is forgiven. Let's roll.<br/><br/>Rocky also boasts perhaps the second most memorable film theme music by Bill Conti, right behind John Williams' score for Jaws, and fine supporting performances from Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Joe Spinnell, not to mention inspired direction from Avildsen. So Stallone didn't quite become the next Brando. How's the old saying go? Better to have been compared to Brando once than to have never been compared to Brando at all. Rocky remains Stallone's shining hour."
"enzoferrari218","9","2","3","29 November 2009"," Better the second time around, by miles!!
","I never for one second appreciated the first time i watched the first Rocky movie. Being about 8, i actually didn't even know who won the first fight between creed and balboa, i'd paid that little attention to it. being told of course over and over that ""the first is always the best"", ""huh, yeh right"" i thought. I'd expected it to be like rocky 3 or 4, but better. They were the films id grown up watching first off as a kid and loved them! The all action blow outs, with big hitting rounds of straight to the point boxing. At the time i felt it to be just too long, too boring and just so action less in comparison, and lets be honest, action as a kid is what we all wanted! I then eventually got to wait up late one evening and watch number 2, so basically i watched them all over the place in terms of order.<br/><br/>However, much further down the line in my life, i watched Rocky for the first time in about 16 years, nothing els on, i had nothing to do, so i just sat and watched it. By the end of the film, having wiped a tear i might add too, being much older, and much more appreciative of life in general, of course having now gone through some of the difficult riggors of growing up and seeing first hand what life can throw at us, i was completely touched and blown away by the overall relevance of this film, i no longer found it boring, old school, too long or action less, but was actually taken in and enchanted by the whole story, not to mention you get the first true glimpse of that famous music and feel good factor that the whole rocky saga brought to us all. The fact i understood what was actually going on this time made an over riding contribution to me loving and really appreciating the story of the film.<br/><br/>I guess one of the biggest regrets i have thus far was watching this saga half way through first off, missing the first films out and watching them all in stupid order. I look back now and so wish i'd never watched the 3rd and 4th instalments first, but i guess for one reason or another that cant be helped as a kid, i mean mum and dad do what ever it takes to keep us happy as kids right? haha! So Having carried the opinion that the first rocky wasn't all that good kinda makes me sad i thought that now.<br/><br/>All in all i rate this film as one of the all time greats, deserving of its classic status and subsequent Oscar nominations and actual winning of Oscar awards, along with many other awards down the years, and of course the citical acclaim it received. As an 8 year old, i never knew i was watching something that never actually set out to be ""all action blow-outs"" but in fact inspirational, something that changed millions of lives, a hope giving and eye opening movie, something that was about to set millions of people on a jurney through life to get what they always dreamed of, and in fact sending that message across the globe that if u do want something, if u want to achieve, grab that life changing dream with both hands and is do-able, of course you can do it. Of course, it is only a film, but what this film did was inspire. A way to sum it up? a story of the unknown bum given a 1 in a million shot at the WBC belt, living the life of a small time club fighter, to eventual 2 time and multi defending WBC heavyweight champion of the world, a dream nearly every little boy had, I know i did."

","Rocky is a modern Cinderella story about a down on his luck leg breaker / Boxer who is given a shot at the world heavywieght title by pure chance, Appollo doesn't pick him because he is a good boxer he picks him mainly because of his nick-name ""The Italian Stallion"". Rocky is written and stars Sylvester Stallone (Four of the sequels are also Directed by him) Stallone gives a very good performance as Rocky as is easily is best role, he has done many silly action films some work (Demolition Man) and some don't (Cobra) but who can blame him surely going on a film set using big guns, driving fast cars and yelling is the most fun job in the world, unfortunately those sort of roles don't get you much respect in Hollywood and Stallone is ridiculed often. The truth is Stallone is a good actor and rocky is a brilliant film, not many films can get an audience so emotional and Rocky does it without making an audience sad and make them cry but makes everybody in an audience jump up out of there seats and cheer, also not many other films use music so well, well done Bill Conti this has to be one of the best film scores in film history. I can't believe that this film isn't in the top 250 when it easily better than a lot of films in the top rated, quick everybody go out watch this and then vote 10 on IMDb i am on a mission to get this in the top 250."
"joepublic","10","2","3","8 July 2005"," There ain't gonna be no re-match
","Rocky seems to be a movie that has suffered in reputation from the legacy of the series as a whole. It is fair to say the series went on to become unrealistic in the extreme and while I have a fondness for parts 2-4 (5 is not good)I honestly believe that the first Rocky movie would be far better thought of without the sequels and the career path that Stallone took.<br/><br/>While the films that followed became event movies, sports action movies the first is a character portrait. Stallone will never better his first performance as Rocky Balboa (although his turn in Copland does come close). Rocky is bitter and has a real dark side. He is unable to relate or communicate with most people and he seems to lead a very insular life. He is at the bottom, a bone breaker for a loan shark with no future. As a boxer he is told early in the movie by Mickey that he had the tools but wasted them. He is a two-bit club fighter and a bum.<br/><br/>Luck (or the American dream) knock on his door when the World heavyweight boxing champion picks him at random, because of his nickname (The Italian Stallion) for a shot at the world title. Unlike the films that follow the chance is dealt with in the most realistic fashion. Rocky is scared. He fears for his safety but most important is his pride. If he can go the distance with Apollo Creed he can finally hold his head high, he will have achieved something.<br/><br/>One of the very best things about this movie is the fantastic supporting cast. Carl Weather's portrayal of Apollo Creed is flawless. The Ali inspired champ is totally convincing not only in but out of the ring. Without this cocky, arrogant foil then Rocky's accomplishments would not mean as much.<br/><br/>Talia Shire is excellent as the meek Adrian and the late Joe Spinel is as watchable as ever as Tony. But the special mentions should go to Burgess Meridith who plays the physically weak but emotionally tough Mickey with brilliant fragility and Burt Young who plays the unhinged Paulie with a disturbing ease. The scene in which Mickey goes to Rocky to offer his management for the fight after the way he has treated him with utter disdain is heartbreaking and brilliantly acted on both sides. Mickey realises it is his last chance and despite Rocky's anger he knows that he needs his help more than anything. The conclusion of the sequence, where Rocky runs onto the street after Mickey, having chastised him, and accepts his offer is one of my favorite movie moments ever, played in long shot with no dialogue.<br/><br/>The locations are superb, the streets of working class Philidephia, the city of brotherly love, are the perfect place for Rocky's grubby life to be played out. This is the factor that Rocky 5 tried to recapture but couldn't years later. The city is almost a character in the film, one of the many factors that holds back Balboa.<br/><br/>The crux of the matter, the element of the film that makes every other element work is the fact that Rocky doesn't win the fight. If he had the efforts at realism and character details would have been for nothing. Rocky's triumphs are personal not physical, he succeeds but doesn't win and that makes the film all the more impressive"

","In the last few weeks,I've been thinking about all the incredible films family friend Guy Morgan introduced to me,before he suddenly passed away at age 46 on March 11, 2019 of a brain aneurysm. One running joke we used to have was Guy saying ""Oh you watch all those French films,but you've not seen Rocky!"" On the first anniversary,I marked it by finally stepping into the ring.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Never having seen a boxing match or boxing film before entering a ring he would return to for the later underdog Sports title The Karate Kid (1984), director John G. Avildsen & his regular cinematographer James Crabe land killer combos, from the left hand long takes hitting a gritty indie atmosphere strike, by the wide-shots being held on Rocky building mutual respect between himself and trainer Mickey,and rolling to the cute awkward romance with Adrian.<br/><br/>
Backed by a hero pose score from Bill Conti, Avildsen pairs the indie left hits with killer knockout right hand thrills, rolling with the punches in early use of Stedicam breathing in the Philadelphia air, and handing out body blows in tightly held panning hits across the in-ring action.<br/><br/>Famously writing the first draft in 3 days whilst penniless, the screenplay by Sylvester Stallone strongly leans towards the autobiographical, but refreshingly avoids tipping into indulgence, thanks to the working class sincerity Sly holds Rocky in, capturing a warm roughness in his clashes with trainer Mickey and the slow-burn romance of Adrian. Working up from his roots, Sly punches up with delightful wish fulfillment of local hero Rocky grabbing the chance to enter the spotlight against mega-star Creed.<br/><br/>Having the flu whilst filming,Talia Shire wonderfully works this into her performance as Adrian,with Shire concerned she might give Sly her flu, leading to sweet nervous excitement over falling in love with Rocky. On one side having Burgess Meredith barking orders as Mickey,and on the other having Carl Weathers's slick cool Creed, Sly gives a excellent performance, pulling at the determined underdog heart of Rocky."

Watching Rocky now that I'm older I see that it is so much more than a boxing movie about a guy who talks kind of funny. It is a movie with heart. It is a movie about determination and strength. Strength of spirt more than of body, although Rocky can really throw a punch (and take one as well) and that training montage will forever be awesome. Rocky is one of the most endearing characters ever in my opinion. He is someone who you just can't help but root for (just watch Rocky IV). But he isn't without his flaws either, he is a real person and that just adds to the likeabillity of the character. He seems like someone you would know.

","""Rocky 1"", a film that even after 40 years still manages to express its purity on the highest sentimental scale. A simple movie that still charms the story of the fifth-rate boxer who has never achieved anything relevant in life and one day has the opportunity to prove his worth. Rocky is to be just one more in the millions, but he had the chance, and he grabbed it, it's easy to identify, it's easy to cheer, it's easy to fall completely in love with the movie, which his big top was supposed to be the final fight , which is nothing more than a fight, because its result is irrelevant, Rocky has never been about winning or losing, but about overcoming your limits and achieving your dreams, and this is for every anthology. ""Rocky 1"" has a powerful moral that stirs the American dream, it's not the movie that takes place in the bicentennial year of American independence and its location, the sad, cold and depressing Philadelphia masterfully recorded by director of photography James Crab that manages to incorporate these characteristics that are fundamental to the film. His screenplay is simple but well built, the rocky, heartbroken, silly rocker, Balboa, who can not say no to anyone and is full of lessons and annoyances, and at the same time excites the viewer, his characterization is great and Rocky , as all the characters in the film are trying to prove something, Paulie, Adrian and Mickey, everyone has something to say and everyone develops along with Rocky, his script carries a development and individualities of impeccable characters that gives a unique three-dimensionality to each character . The good direction also helps the great script and the excellent performances, with one of the most vibrant, iconic, unique and exciting soundtrack of the history of the cinema, composed by Bill Conti, it is impossible not to mention its exquisite fit the work, that later would come to being an anthem not only of the franchise, but practically everything that involves boxing, other highlights are the excellent montages and compositions of scenes, costumes and the wonderful makeup, mainly in the final fight that is ahead of its time in terms of makeup and effects . Rocky is pure feeling, Stallone shines in this film as nobody, with script written by him in three days and a beautiful performance, the brucuto that years later would be seen as bad movie signal shows his talent, or not, because Rocky is a mirror of Stallone's life, he does not act, he only lives the character he created himself in the truest way I've ever seen in the movies, ""Rocky I"" was an absolute success, such as Stallone, born along with the powerful franchise which would be created in the future. This film goes beyond many technical or aritic aspects, it is a lesson, a feeling, a more complete demonstration of clarity of ideas, with problems is true, especially in its rhythm and in the narrowing of the third act but even so Rocky enchants the world more than 40 years for its genuinely true and touching simplicity."
"CubsandCulture","10","1","1","10 January 2019"," Mythical. Honest. American.
","This film uses boxing, and a bum's life to provide a engaging look into the American dream. What the dream is. Why it is unattainable for so many people. And what happens to those lucky few who do make it. Rocky only gets his shot because of the sheer luck of his nickname; America loves an underdog, but they also love a cynical entertainer. Stallone's script is really good at capturing this dual quality. So much of this film is just easy naturalism. The central love story is the most ordinary love story in the whole world. Paulie and Micky are just a couple of guys who missed their shot and resent Rocky for it.<br/><br/>And yet for all that easy naturalism the film has a grand quality to it. The fights are quite good, especially for the time. The film is filled with symbolism, some of it quite overtly religious. Creed riding in as Washington is a mythical image about American mythology. It is not surprising that this film spawned so many sequels. Americans love sagas too."

","SUMMARY: This films shows perseverance, hard work, and finally, it shows how it pays off in the long run. ""Rocky"" is a celluloid masterpiece that captures the life of a broke fighter who makes his own way in life by entering the professional boxing world. Meanwhile, he lives in the backstreets of Philadelphia, and is quoted as ""a cheap, second-rate loan shark."" which in Rocky's eyes, he sees as a career, a living. He is an average person of his time, until a bicentennial fight is proposed, To give an underdog a chance. Because of Rocky's nickname, ""The Italian Stallion"" a professional boxer who goes by the name of Apollo Creed chooses Rocky to fight him. At this time, Rocky has a crush on Adrian Pennino, the sister of Paulie Pennino, one of Rocky's friends. Eventually, Rocky and Adrian get together and both live in Rocky's broken apartment. He has to train for this fight, in which he goes under an intense, electrifying training regimen that inspires the viewer. While still picking up loans from Gazzo, to pay for his gym membership. A while later, the fight starts. Apollo Creed vs The Italian Stallion. Creed is knocked down in the first round, to the crowd's astonishment. 14 rounds pass, and an uplifting fight montage starts. Rocky goes the 15 miles, but Creed wins by points decision.<br/><br/>My opinion on Rocky. It's a wonderful film that shows it wasn't just about reckless fighting and violence, but it was about romance, drama, it captures the emotions of a lonely man whose life is a million-to-one shot. There is a real story to the film, and it is based on Stallone around that time. He was broke, he had to sell his dog just to feed himself, and sold his pregnant wife's jewellery, just to get by. Rocky was a fighter, but that is not the whole point of the film. It's about love, perseverance, which makes it known for it's character strengths. Ever since I was 5-6 years old, I have been watching Rocky. Now I am a teenager, and Rocky has inspired me to become a boxer myself. It is a truly inspiring film, that is definitely worth watching."

","A lot of us movie-goers are either working class heroes or middle-class warriors. Barely any of us will truly understand what it is like to be a superhero or a millionaire. Most of us just live in a rat race full of others just like us; Blue collared laborers trying to make it to tommorow.<br/><br/>Rocky is just like a lot of us - he's a 30 year old high school dropout who lives on simple things, but his perk is that he likes fighting as a hobby. However, despite the fact he is good at it, He never pursues it into a profession, much to the disdain of his trainer, Mickey. However, one day, the World Heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed realizes all the contenders for his title are either injured, out of shape, or scared of him. However, he has put so much energy into promoting a fight for the american bicentennial birthday, he becomes desperate for a challenger, and hoping for a safe bet, reads Rocky's moniker, the Italian Stallion and wants him to fight, insuring himself an easy victory. However, Rocky sees this as his chance to prove that he's ""Not just another bum from the neighborhood.""<br/><br/>Rocky has actually held up very well in the 40+ years since it's release. It's tough for a movie to age well but Rocky does just fine. The gritty, mean, dirty feel of downtown philadelphia still holds up today, as many of us have seen those types of gritty, broken down neighborhoods in our time.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Sylvester Stallone knew exactly what he wanted in the Rocky character and he was right to argue for the right to play the role. His co-stars Burt Young, who plays Paulie, Rocky's drunk, lazy, lethargic but loyal friend, is also very spot on in attitude and in looks. Talia Shire, who stars as Rocky's love interest Adrian, plays the fragile, shy virgin girl who over the next few movies, grows stronger, almost as if Rocky's positive attitude rubs off on her over time. Burgess Meredith plays Mickey, a bitter old trainer who feels that Rocky is a waste of time, but thinks he might change his attitude after being given a world title shot. And the World Champion Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, is an almost exact duplicate of the legendary fighter, Muhammad Ali. To put it bluntly, EVERYONE in this film knows exactly who they're trying to be, and they do it flawlessly.<br/><br/>Bill Conti's score will forever be timeless in this film. Everyone at some point has to have heard the Rocky theme song, which will forever stand out as a masterpiece. Every song and musical piece conveys emotions extremely well, from the somber & unsure ""Philadelphia morning"" to the powerful, emotional, and motivational ""Going the Distance.""<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film before, you are truly missing out. There's a reason this movie is in the top 250 on the IMDb and odds are it's going to stay there for a very, very long time."
"josephellis","7","1","1","8 December 2018"," More than a boxing movie
","This film is very different than the sequels. It's more of a Drama that explains Balboa's early life. It's cool to revisit, seeing him before his success. For those who just want boxing, you won't get too much of it. It focuses on the drama and character buildups more than action. You still have to watch this before you watch the others."

","Rocky is a film that just works on so many levels. Yes, it was low budget, even for 1976, but it's one of the aspects of the film that actually works to it's advantage. Rocky is a man from the humble streets of Philadelphia, poor and seemingly going nowhere in life. The movie, much like it's sequels paralleled the struggles that Stallone faced making it as an actor. The cinematography and the way it's shot really sympathizes with the way Rocky saw his life. Stallone with his charm and wit took a lot of the limitations and budget restrictions of the movie and just made it work. It is unquestionably the best of the series. As time goes by it's more clear that this film carries an inspiration that resonates. I recently visited the city of Philadelphia, and saw the Rocky statue, and felt the movie has a lasting legacy, not just for Philadelphia but for all humanity. The scene just before the fight where Rocky reveals to Adrian his doubts and fears about fighting Apollo was shot at the last minute but is one of the key scenes to the movie. Truly, one of the most inspiring movies ever made!!"

"mmallon4","10","1","1","24 March 2018"," The Philadelphia Story
","I may sound like a bit of a fanboy when I talk about the Rocky franchise but I just legitimately love all these movies so much. This is a series which always inspires me and has aided me during my darkest days. Rocky was one of the first movies to have such a profound impact on me, making me appreciate cinema on a deeper level. I first saw Rocky on TV and week after week came back to watch the sequels; such joy I had and memories I never forget.<br/><br/>I don't think there is a fictional character whom I've been more emotionally invested in than Rocky Balboa. Could there be a character who is more honest or down to Earth? A man who has next to nothing yet has such a positive outlook on life (""Naw I ain't got no phone, I had to pull it you know because people calling me all the time, and who needs the aggravation, right?"" - such profound wisdom). The character is also a mystery and an enigma; who are his parents and what about his early years? Apart from a few brief snippets of information, it's up to the viewer's imagination instead of giving us a pointless origin story which Hollywood is so keen on nowadays. The character is biographical of his creator Sylvester Stallone throughout the whole series; his fictional alter ego. Just like Rocky, Stallone had next to nothing before making it as a star. Just like how the character rises to the challenge against impossible odds, the movie also beat impossible odds by becoming one of the biggest sleeper hits of all time. Likewise what movie or character is more identified with a city or has such reverence for the location it was filmed.<br/><br/>All the films in the series reflect the periods in which they were made. It's 1976, America's Bicentennial year. Perhaps the country didn't know it needed an injection of optimism after years of cynical and pessimistic film as well as political upheaval. Don't get me wrong, there will always be a place for cynicism in movies but with such movies dominating the mainstream at the time it was clear that enough was enough. It seems like happy endings where against the law in the first half of the 70's, but Rocky brought them back for better or worse, and film snobs will look down on it for that. But yes, I do blubber away at this ending and Adrian's uttering of ""I love you!"" is the greatest ""I love you!"" in cinema history. The ending has that same feeling of joy and happiness as seen in the ending of many Frank Capra movies. Speaking of Capra, Rocky's response to being asked if he wants to fight Apollo Creed for the world heavyweight championship is like Gary Cooper in Mr Deeds Goes to Town when he is told of the vast sum of money he has inherited.<br/><br/>As the filmmakers didn't get permission to shot for many of the on locations, guerilla filmmaking techniques where employed in the making of Rocky; capturing the streets of Philadelphia in all their glory with that distinctive that gritty look of 70's films while aided with the use of the then-new technology in the form of the steady cam. You'd be hard pressed to find a movie which is more naturalistic and unmanufactured as Rocky.<br/><br/>It's astounding that such a low budget film could have had such a great soundtrack and score. Bill Conti's score to Rocky always makes me feel melancholic; the Rocky soundtracks have given me hours upon hours of listening pleasure. I even watch the end credits of all the films for the music (well except the first one as the end credit music here is quite dreary). The Rocky movies are also responsible for my love of montages. I'll never forget the feeling of exuberance I felt watching the film's training montage for the first time and hearing Gonna Fly Now; we're talking the goosiest of goosebumps.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert compared Stallone to Marlon Brando in his original review, and in 1976 no one could have seen this man being a future action movie star, but I maintain the man is more intelligent than people make him out to be. He's made a respectable career out of what he is capable of doing. How many people can claim to have been able to write installments in a film series which has lasted four decades and still manage to keep the long-running story interesting? During the filming of Rocky, he had to do script rewrites on the spot such as upon discovering the ice rink for Rocky and Adrian's was completely empty or the shorts on the giant poster of Rocky in the stadium where the wrong colour.<br/><br/>When I watched this film at a younger age, I never fully appreciated the romantic angle, yet watching it from a more mature perspective. Rocky and Adrian are like two misfits who don't fully fit in with the rest of society. There is a goddess with Adrian, and only Rocky can see it. The scene in which Rocky invites Adrian to his apartment after their first date took my breath away like few other love scenes have ever done. The sexuality on display is immense with Stallone in a vest and the gradual build-up to their first kiss, and I'm sure they did it.<br/><br/>The world of Rocky is populated with such unforgettable characters. Rocky's trainer Mickey Goldmill is one of the greatest mentors in film history (either him or Obi-Wan Kenobi in my book) with his grouchy and curmudgeon manner. I feel Burgess Meredith is an actor who got better with age, so no surprise his most famous role came to him at the age of 68. Paulie (Burt Young) is one pathetic hateful loser, abuses his sister, is violent and yet you can't help but feel sorry for him. Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) on the other hand, dam! What a showman with his charisma, confidence, cockiness, and ego; the archetype of a leading man from a blacksploitation film. Yet despite being a black man, he is surely one of the most patriotic characters ever put on screen who shuns any left wing mentality of victimhood; sounds like a dam monster movie!<br/><br/>One more recent viewings of Rocky I've also come to appreciate Tony Gazzo (Joe Spinell) more as a character. A charismatic loan shark who employs Rocky and has a real liking for him, giving him money for his date, attends his fight with Apollo and doesn't try to take over his boxing career whereas many other mobsters would. Yet Rocky's lenient collecting style by refusing to break the thumbs of clients who don't pay up causes problems for Gazzo yet he treats Rocky almost like a brother. It shouldn't come as a surprise then that in the original script for the film, Rocky and Gazzo where brothers.<br/><br/>When Rocky visits the empty arena before the fight you can feel the pressure and weight that bestows him. By the time the final fight comes around I'm so emotionally invested in this character that I'm rooting for him like it's a real fight. During the fight itself, the punches look real and there's no sped up footage like boxing films of the past; while Bill Conti's score ups the intensity and suspense for some serious emotional impact."

","Rocky Movie Review
 I chose do do a movie about a movie series starting off with the first movie, Rocky. I personally selected this movie because it not only portrays a exquisite storyline, but also portrays numerous themes of perseverance and character development. The movie Rocky is about a regular guy named Rocky Balboa, and he does boxing as a hobby to make a little cash. He likes a woman named Adrian who is his friend's sister. However, he knows this trainer named Micky and he's mad at him because Rocky has the potential to be a great boxer but he doesn't use his talent to make himself better. Apollo creed, the heavy weight champion of the world, offered Rocky a shot for the title to prove to the world that anyone can have an opportunity to be great. Rocky took this opportunity and trained with Micky. At the end of the movie, which is the fight between Rocky and Apollo, it was supposed to be one sided for Creed. However, Rocky fights his heart out, knocking down Apollo Creed, giving him a very tough match. At the end, however, Rocky loses and the second movie is the rematch. This movie series has a total of 5 movies highlighting Rocky's boxing career and is still continued to this very day when Rocky is old and training Apollo Creed's son, Adonis Creed. 
 To me, this movie is worth watching because it is knows for being one of the most inspiring movies of all time. It motivated me to start working harder and to believe that anything can be done if you truly put your heart and soul into it. Because of watching Rocky's hard training, it pushed me to start working out harder and even pushing me to be a better person and a stronger student in school. It teaches you how to build yourself up from nothing and no never give up. Rocky once said, ""It's not about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now if you know what you're worth, than go out and get what you're worth but you gotta be willing to take this hits and stop pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody, cowards do that."" I remember his exact words because I was deeply inspired by what he said and I probably will never forget what he said. Overall, I highly recommend this movie for anyone of all ages. 
 There were many reviews all of them ranging from 2-10 stars. The majority of the reviews for Rocky was 10/10 with a few 9/10 and 8/10. However, I did see a review that rated the movie a 2/10 and it said, ""World's biggest let down? Yes"" I believe the reason for that is because Rocky was defeated at the end of the first movie, but I am positive that if that user were to watch the rest of the movie series, he or she would be incredibly happy to see that Rocky was victorious at the end. This demonstrates the many individuals who treasure the original movie and it's artistry to portray self development and determination.
 Although there may be a few people out there who do not like the movie a Rocky, starring Sylvester Stallone, I truly do believe that this is the greatest movie to ever exist. Like my mother said, Rocky isn't just a boxer, he is an inspiration and a great role model to all. Encouraging individuals to never give up and to chase their dreams proves to be a great way to inspire others. Not only that, Rocky is a clean person as well. He treats Adrian and his friends so well that it makes me want to be like that to other people. The way he never gives up in his fight makes me a stronger person, wanting to be just like him and never give up when life seems to be getting too hard. Rocky had a broken nose, broken ribs, one eye swollen shut, out of breath and border line dying but yet he still found the will power to push through all that adversity. Overall, I highly recommend this movie as is has won numerous rewards and nominees and is still known till this very day as one of the greatest movies to ever exist."

","Rocky (1976) is a film directed by John G. Avildsen (1935-2017). The flim was written and stars Sylvester Stallone. The film co-stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith. Thayer David (1927-1978) and Jimmy Gambina also co-star.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone wrote the script for ""Rocky"" in 3 and a half days. United Artists loved Stallone's script and were planning to use it as a vehicle for an already famous star, such as Burt Reynolds or James Caan. Sylvester Stallone wanted to star in the film. The producers agreed. Sylvester Stallone later stated ""If the film became a huge success without me in it, I would have never forgiven myself."" <br/><br/>The film was mostly shot in Philadelphia. The film used Garret Brown's Steadicam for the training scenes and some of the fighting scenes. 
The most famous scene of the film is where after Rocky trains for the fight he runs up the Philadelphia Museum of Art (AKA ""Rocky Steps"") and raises his arms in the air. <br/><br/>Rocky is a film about the rags-to-riches story of a small-time boxer named Rocky ""The Italian Stallion"" Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), who is uneducated but kind-hearted. He is an Italian-American boxer who also works a debt collector for Tony Gazzo (Joe Spinell) in the streets of Philadelphia. Rocky starts out a club-fighter. However, World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) finds out 5 weeks before his Bicentennial Super Fight that his opponent has severely injured his hand. With all the other ranked contenders either scheduled or busy doing something else, Creed decides to choose an unknown to have a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship. He chooses Rocky. Rocky now has a shot to become a World Heavyweight Champion. He has a best friend Paulie (Burt Young), who is an abusive drunk. Paulie's sister, Adrian, Rocky meets at the pet shop that she works at. Rocky goes every day and night to tell her a joke. Eventually, they go out on a date and kiss. Adrian is timid and shy and Rocky is strong but uneducated. They have great chemistry together and provide a great bond throughout the film. Rocky meets Miles Jergens (Thayer David) who offers him the title shot. Rocky reluctantly agrees, with his pay being $150,000. He tells Adrian about this. After a few weeks of training, Rocky agrees for Mickey ""Mighty Mick"" Goldmill, a highly respected trainer/manager and a former Bantamweight boxer from the 1920's, who earlier in the film, criticizes Rocky for not showing all his potential. Paulie becomes very jealous of Rocky's success and Rocky weakens his anger by letting his company Shamrock Meats be advertised for Rocky, paying Paulie $3,000. The night before the fight, Rocky begins to doubt himself after walking around the arena. He talks to Adrian, stating that he doesn't expect to win, he just wants to go the distance with Creed so that he can prove to himself that he was no bum from the neighborhood. The next day on New Year's Day (January 1, 1976), Rocky Balboa takes on Apollo Creed for the World Heavyweight Championship. Creed is very cocky at first and Rocky knocks him down to the ground - the first time Creed has ever been knocked down. Creed then takes Rocky more seriously but still never loses his cocky ego. Rocky goes the distance with Creed after 15 rounds of intense boxing. The bell rings and the fight is over. Both fighters get off of each over. The result of the fight is a split decision (8:7, 7:8, 9:6). Apollo Creed retains the title. In the end, Rocky and Adrian profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.<br/><br/>""Rocky"" was a sleeper hit made off of a small $1,000,000 budget. The film grossed $225,000,000 worldwide. It is the highest grossing film of 1976. Rocky has a worldwide percentage return of over 11,000 percent. The film, if converted into 2015 prices, would have grossed $460,000,000. <br/><br/>""Rocky"" is critically acclaimed and is considered one of the greatest films of all time. The film won 3 Academy Awards:
1. Best Picture - ""Rocky"" (1976) - Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff (Producers)
2. Best Director - John G. Avildsen 
3: Best Film Editing - Richard Halsey and Scott Conrad 
The film was also nominated for 7.
In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"". <br/><br/>In my opinion, ""Rocky"" (1976) is THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL-TIME. It is truly the ultimate underdog story. 10/10. A film you must see before you die."
"doranbriscoe","10","1","1","31 October 2017"," ""All I wanna do is go the distance""
","I find Rocky to be one of my very favorite films because of how complete it is, from the writing of the screenplay to the acting to the soundtrack to how the whole thing comes together so effectively with such originality. It's the quintessential underdog story of life and love and fighting for one's dreams, a work of art straight from the heart of Sylvester Stallone. <br/><br/>I think what I find so endearing about Rocky is how much I can connect to it individually. Rocky is the every-man that so many of us can relate to, and I haven't found a film that so perfectly encapsulates the struggles of life that I also find myself facing. I think that way more than being a boxing film, Rocky is a fighting film- it's the fight that we all have to face to varying degrees.<br/><br/>Rocky comes from the bottom. Notwithstanding his heart and honesty, he wasn't blessed with the same talents and abilities that others may have; he's clumsy in speech and perhaps not the brightest of the lot. Like Adrian, he's surrounded by people (ahem, Mickey) who tell him he's not good enough, to ""stay down."" And like I feel in many circumstances, he feels inadequate. But he approaches those struggles head on. Whatever blows he's dealt, he comes back with persistence that he can overcome those obstacles. His simple hope is to become more than just an average bum; he uses his frustration to fuel himself towards rising above the mediocre misery that plagues so many.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when he lies down in bed the night before the big fight and confides in Adrian how he doesn't really feel the need to win, he just wants ""to go the distance."" Likewise, I don't need to be the best, but if I can just match up against the struggles I face, stand toe to toe with them, refuse to let them knock me out- endureÂ… Well, that's a victory worth celebrating. In the end, what the movie focuses on is not the outcome of the match, but on the love between Rocky and Adrian. Because in a world full of turmoil, underdogs like Rocky and Adrian can find each other, and rise together- and that's what matters."

","Here is a good trivia question to ask. That question is, ""What was the first sports movie to ever win Best Picture at the Oscars?"" The movie with that special honor is 1976's Rocky. This movie is an American classic and it's widely known to be one of the most influential sports movies of all time. This movie spawned many sequels and a spin-off movie. The character of Rocky Balboa remains to this day a heavy cultural presence. In fact, if you travel to the Philadelphia Art Museum, you'll be able to see a statue of Rocky at those famed steps. There is nothing special about the story itself. It's a by-the-numbers underdog story, but it's the underlying themes that make this movie so special. The themes of heroism and being the underdog really elevated this movie.<br/><br/>The making of this movie is part of that underdog theme, and it took a very long time for this movie to make it to the big screen. Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay and it was widely acclaimed in the movie industry. The studios felt it could have been a star vehicles for the likes of Robert Redford. But Stallone only wanted the movie to happen if he can act in the movie as the lead role. The studio executives thought that wouldn't work because of his lack of acting experience. But with a very low budget, MGM/United Artists was able to get the movie made with Stallone in the lead role. This is an example of those classic underdog stories that I love to see.<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) nicknamed ""The Italian Stallion"" is a boxer who is struggling to make the big-time. He earns some money by collecting debts for a debt collector. He gets his lucky break when heavyweight boxing star Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) arrives in Philadelphia to set up a match for show. In order for ""nobody"" to become a ""somebody."" Apollo Creed chooses Rocky Balboa because of his nickname. Of course, Apollo believes he will win. But with the help of his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and his oft-quiet girlfriend Adrian (Talia Shire), Rocky seizes this opportunity to leave his struggles and bring a name to himself.<br/><br/>The film is an American classic in part due to its iconic performances. Sylvester Stallone wasn't a name before this movie, so that makes it even more amazing the success of this movie. I previously seen him in 1971's Bananas as one of the hoodlums on the subway. But here, with his heavy physical presence and his instant recognizable voice, he brings himself into the public spotlight and forever, Stallone will be known as Rocky Balboa. Stallone drew inspiration from the likes of Joe Frazier and Mohammad Ali. He created such a tender performance in my eyes. He may act tough in the ring, but he had such a good heart otherwise. A classic example is where he would visit the very shy Adrian in her pet store job just to visit her. Speaking of Adrian, Talia Shire delivered a good performance as Adrian. Her character is vastly different than her Connie Corleone character from The Godfather and I appreciate that. Carl Weathers does a great job as Apollo Creed. The look on his face when he realized Rocky was trying to beat him was just a priceless look. Burt Young, who portrays Adrian's brother Paulie, also does a solid job. He was a very abusive brother and the scene where he destroys the house with a baseball bat because he was not pleased with Adrian, added more drama to the movie and it showed the kind of man Paulie is. Last but not least, I must mention Burgess Meredith in his incredibly powerful performance as Mickey. Meredith was cast against type and despite being an old man, he helped Rocky get into the ring against Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>The movie has many iconic scenes to it. There is the training scene where Rocky is punching the meat carcasses. I loved that scene, but here's another trivia. That scene was actually influenced by the training of Joe Frazier. Then who can forget about the iconic scene of running up the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum and punching the air to the tune of Bill Conti's ""Gonna Fly Now."" I loved that scene and I loved that music-both which remain cultural influences to this day. It's just worth watching Rocky just to see these awesome training scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed watching Rocky very much. Admittedly, I am not much of a boxing fan. However, I was able to get engaged in the movie because it's not just a story about boxing. It's story about being a underdog, a true American hero. The story itself is a simple story and nothing that hasn't been seen before, but it does draw you in and it keeps you engaged. I enjoyed the underdog aspect of the film. To see Sly from collecting money to facing the heavyweight champion, a feat that most people can only dream of. If you watch this movie, you can see why this film remains such an inspiration for many-especially athletes. Keep an eye on the performance by Stallone. A very incredible performance. One that was so good, that Roger Ebert compared him to Marlon Brando. The film lacks originality, but it makes up for it in everything else. John G. Avildsen directed a wonderful engaging sports film and one that will live on and on.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"
"TopDawgCritic","9","1","1","12 July 2017"," The greatest boxing movie franchise
","The Rocky franchise, starting with this one, is what propelled Sylvester Stallone to stardom. Written and staring Sylvester Stallone, this is by far the greatest boxing movie franchise in history. Excellent story, and very inspirational. If you have not seen this franchise, then do so in chronological order, and finish it off with Creed. It's a 9/10 from me!"
"jamesbamesy","9","1","1","24 June 2017"," A sports classic that would spawn the career of a legendary movie icon.
","Ah, Rocky. What else is there to talk about that hasn't already been said? The movie that put Sylvester Stallone on the map and won the Oscar for Best Picture back in '77. As a movie goer, I wanted to explore the Rocky films, as I got the Blu-ray collection of the original 6 movies. It was a truly great experience watching these films and made me a fan of the series. But with that being said, how does the original hold up compared to the sequels? Well, the answer may be obvious, but let's just start anyway, shall we?<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a broken boxer, who is looked upon as a ""bum"" because of his habits in the streets of Philadelphia. He is later seen being competed against Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), giving Rock a one to million shot on New Year's Eve 1975. He decides to accept the fight, as well as dealing with his relationship to his friend Paulie's (Burt Young) sister Adrian (Talia Shire), and having his old trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) come to help him prepare for the battle.<br/><br/>One strong aspect of this movie is how believable the characters are due to its solid casting. Take the title character himself for example; he may seem like some bad cause to the locals, but all he is is just a lonely guy who's hoping something good will happen to him. And even though Stallone may have been repeating words over in his sentences (""You know"" being a prime example of this), it was in his early times, so it's understandable.<br/><br/>Another thing this movie has to offer is the score done by Bill Conti and the cinematography (most notably the training scene and the final fight between Balboa and Creed). The music just gets you invested and the camera shots are excellent, like the iconic ""running up the steps"" scene with the amazing ""Gonna Fly Now"" tune. It just makes you so excited it gives you goosebumps each time you see it.<br/><br/>However, if there is one thing to criticize here is that it can get rather slow at times. The first act is just Rocky trying to live his normal life. This is even worse when sequels like Rocky III and IV would come along and make the series more enjoyable to watch because of their nonstop action sequences. But that's not to say it ruins the whole movie, in fact by doing so, it makes it feel a lot more subtle in addition to the grainy atmosphere that makes the movie feel so realistic and down-to-earth.<br/><br/>To many people, Rocky is a film that teaches us that it isn't necessarily winning that matters, but how much you try that counts. Thus, it doesn't feel like your typical sports drama, where the protagonist has to win the game to succeed their goal. Unfortunately, many of the sequels do rely on the goal of winning, which in a way, kills the original's meaning. But if you can get past that, this message is motivational enough to become a timeless piece of advice whenever you're feeling negative about yourself.<br/><br/>With believable acting, a fantastic soundtrack, memorable characters, well-structured plot, and a great message, the first Rocky movie is really a 1970's classic you wouldn't wanna miss out on. Chances are, though, you've already seen it, but if not, do give it a watch. It is essentially the film a lot of people should see for its realistic morals and how we tend to fail plenty in life and need to learn to get better. The best of the Rocky franchise, and probably Sly Stallone's best next to First Blood, I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10, closer to a 9."
"KingBrian1","9","1","1","26 April 2017"," A Powerful Story
","This is Sylvester Stallone's greatest work of art. 70's period piece set in Philadelphia about the strugglers of a down on his luck amateur boxer. One day the Champion of the World Apollo Creed enters his world and gives him an opportunity of his life. Rocky must rise to the occasion, overcome life obstacles fight in the biggest contest in the world against the greatest Boxer of them all. The drab setting of Rocky is somewhat hard to get into at first but as the movie progresses you come to admire Rocky more and more until finally you see him as a cut above the rest with his love Adrian and determination to prove he is a champion. Never quit, never lay down and always aim for the stars is the Rocky story. The fact that it so happens to be a boxing movie and the violent nature of the sport just goes to show how good drama is that people who would normally dislike such a sport can get invested in it."
"nakians","8","1","1","5 February 2017"," Rocky, Definitely the American Dream!
","Rocky is a film telling the story of an amateur boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) who worked as a debt collector for a loan shark in 1970s Philadelphia. This is a good depiction of the typical American rags to riches story. Rocky develops feelings and pursues a pet shop worker by the name of Adrian (Talia Shire) and we watch their relationship grow as the movie progresses. Rocky is given a shot at the title of world heavyweight champion when the reigning heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) challenges him to a fight. The purpose of the fight was to give an unknown boxer a shot against the champion. Rocky accepts the challenge and begins his famous training regime leading up to the legendary running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The much anticipated boxing match takes place on New Year's Day in an arena full of spectators. The fight is long and very intense lasting the entire 15 rounds, and both boxers are pretty badly beaten up. Once the fight ends, everyone pretty much goes wild as this was one of the most entertaining fights in history. The winner is finally announced with Creed named the winner by virtue of a split decision. <br/><br/>As stated earlier, the theme for Rocky is the typical American Dream story of rags to riches or maybe even just a well told success story. Rocky also can be seen as a love story in a way. We get to watch the relationship between Rocky and Adrian blossom and grow throughout the movie. Rocky set the benchmark for similar movies later on that used the same theme and even plot. A good movie that comes to mind with a similar theme to Rocky is Cinderella Man (2005). Russell Crowe's character in that movie (James Braddock) is struggling to make ends meet and is eventually given a shot at the title in fight against Max Baer. <br/><br/>There are several film techniques that are used throughout Rocky that truly make the movie unforgettable. I was use the last few scenes of the boxing match against Apollo Creed as an example. The angles are very close to show the intensity of strength of the punches thrown between the two fighters. There are also very quick transitions between frames to capture the action of the fight and emotion. The sound effects were amazing as well. There is the visible sounds of the punches being thrown and the grunts and moans of the fighters. While at the same time, we also hear the invisible sounds of the crowd cheering and the bell ringing in the background. The great use of sound effects really made it seem as if you were actually at the boxing match.<br/><br/>Overall I think this was a very good movie and was definitely worthy the Academy Award it received. This movie truly had me rooting for the main character (and also Adrian). I was disappointed when he didn't win the fight."
"xenazues","9","1","1","10 January 2017"," Back when people had great Original Ideas
","I must say this idea isn't new but its original to filming. I guess I'm a little bias. All new movies involve comic book characters or some cartoon. This was back when star wars, jaws, and the godfather were around. Great movies which seem written by people, not the production company ripping off someone else's idea. Yeah rocky was based on a fight ali had. And its a lot of stereo types clearly all over the place. And yes most of what is in this movie will at the very least get you slapped and probably honestly arrested (loan sharking big no no). <br/><br/>But you can feel the realism in this movie. The pictures on the wall he shows adrian in the movie. Yeap some of those are of him. The orange that the person on the sidewalk throws as hes running, yeap that is real. They didn't even want to do the movie with him but he refused to sell it even with only a 100 dollars in his bank account at the time. Which probably more than I have in mine right now, no joke. <br/><br/>But he had passion and he had a dream. And you can see it in this movie. I guess I'm bias too on the Italian accent. The actors all the way down to the mobsters played their parts well. Carl Weathers was a great pick as well. Without him the film probably wouldn't have made it. His acted was really great. And of course they played into the white street guy making it big beating up a known unliked hyped up guy. It was easy not to like apollo creeds character. <br/><br/>I know I hit telia shire hard in a lot of her movies including the godfather. But her acting was great in this. They couldn't have picked a better female. And we have to remember carrie fisher was around as well many other females actresses. Cher was thought of for the role? That would have been a huge mistake. I was very unhappy with her character (talia shire)in the godfather as sonny's sister. Always getting beat up. And this almost played into that. But when she decided to speak up it was different than other films. Other films take it way too far. You seem to get they are targeting a female audience (which nothing is wrong with that) by giving it the ""you go girl"" kind of feeling. Something I instantly take a point away when reviewing movies. The movies need to just let it rip and let the audience watch a good film. Don't try to muck it up by throwing in something to please a certain group. Whom ever it maybe. Her brother paulie fights she sticks up for herself and says ""you need a roommate"". And it sounded so real, realistic, true. Nothing forced.<br/><br/>Paulie played a great part as well. Its not as easy playing the part of an alcoholic. And unlike other films he kind of made you like him. He wasn't beating up on his wife or sister. He lived with his sister. Hard times which hits at the heart too. Sometimes family members move in together. I recently took over my friends brothers half of the rent cause he moved out. And this that was 2016 and families still live like that. Although we live in pleasantville compared to philly but still.<br/><br/>Last but not least it left you wanting more. Too many movies want to tie and finish everything up and be done with it. Too many fans want to know everything. Sometimes its great to ask questions when you get done.<br/><br/>Once again sly wrote the script and I think I read the filming took a short period of time. Highest grossing film of that year. And people doubted him and said they even didn't want to act with him. Carl weathers was hired instantly after he acted with sly and said he wanted to act with real actors. He didn't know that sly was the real actor then after finding out he says ""well he will get better"" That is how the whole movie is. The promise that you can do something and eventually step up to the next level. Never hold your own thoughts about yourself back. How could this film be anymore than the American dream? If people doubt you, keep living your dreams. The man even had his own dog in the movie. How crazy is that. This is a must see movie. I just bought the series on blue ray in disc set. I don't review a movie unless I recently seen it. Just so I can give a good review."

Rocky also netted 3 well deserved Academy Awards but unfortunately nothing for Sylvester Stallone who was not only the main star of the movie, but also wrote the screenplay. Rocky was also the movie that catapulted Sylvester Stallone into stardom.<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a small time boxer in Philadelphia struggling to make ends meet in the ring and outside the ring where he earns a meagre wage as a debt collector for local crime boss Gazzo (Joe Spinell). To make matters worse Rocky finds himself on the outer with his trainer Mick (Burgess Meredith), with Mick dismissing Rocky as someone that has needlessly wasted his talent as a boxer.

Apollo Creed picks Rocky on the basis of his nickname ""The Italian Stallion"". Rocky also finds love after hooking up with the shy and timid Adrian (Talia Shire), sister of Rocky's good friend Paulie (Burt Young). Mick also mends fences with Rocky and agrees to train Rocky. Rocky trains harder for his million-to-one shot at the title to earn his own self-respect and vows that no matter if he wins or loses, he wants to go the distance with Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is a delight to see light up the screen as his now iconic character Rocky Balboa.

","What to say about this movie? This is one of the best pictures ever made. Stallone (who also wrote film's screenplay) stars as Rocky Balboa, small time boxer who is living in a small apartment infested with roaches and almost always doesn't have money for that same apartment. He doesn't like his job (working for loan sharks) and (like all of us) dreams of something better. He boxes every night because that is the only constant thing in his life. Also, every single day he tries to impress 'the girl' Adrian (played by Talia Shire), but all his attempts ends unsuccessfully. But, everything will change when heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (played by Carl Weathers) pick him for his next opponent. Apollo is doing that because he knows that Rocky does not have what it takes to beat him. He believes that will easily defend the champion's belt, but he doesn't know that Rocky isn't just some guy, some loser... Oh, no... He is a fighter, he never backs down. This is his only chance to do something with his life, to do something great... And, how many punches he must receive to do this, he will endure till the end. This movie is a 'must-watch' because it tells the story of an outsider who is nothing most of his life and who is never getting a chance to do anything right. But, when he does... Will he use it? Also, you must watch this movie because Stallone give's us one of the best performances in a lifetime, before he went to do some really, really bad action and comedy movies.

","The quintessential underdog tale whose success emulated its very own story, Rocky didn't just became the highest grossing film of its year despite being made on a mere budget of a million dollars but also went on to win three Academy Awards including Best Picture, and is also responsible for launching the career of many, most notably Sylvester Stallone.<br/><br/>Set in Philadelphia, Rocky tells the story of Rocky Balboa, a small time boxer working as a debt collector for a loan shark who later gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship when the reigning champion, Apollo Creed, decides to give a local contender a chance of a lifetime. The plot then follows Rocky's training for the big night for he prepares to go all the distance against Creed.<br/><br/>Written by Sylvester Stallone & directed by John G. Avildsen, Rocky is crafted with a clear vision of what it's supposed to be and is totally devoted to its script & the characters who inhabit it. The screenplay is brilliantly penned down for each character plays a relevant role in the story's outcome but the focus is always on its titular character, who is fleshed out by Stallone amazingly well, both on paper & on the film canvas.<br/><br/>Shot on a shoestring budget which seems pretty evident from the set pieces its production design team puts up on the screen, the technical aspects here may lack the more polished, refined look when compared to other examples of its genre but its raw photography doesn't bother much for the film's heart is very much at the right place and it somehow manages to make each one of its shortcomings work in the story's favour.<br/><br/>The camera-work & lighting is crude but is expected, given its low budget. Editing is a mixed bag for few moments end up overstaying its welcome while it's absolutely perfect on other instances. But the biggest contributor of them all, in my opinion, is Bill Conti's magnificent score that elevates the experience to a whole different level with its pulsating, passionate & inspiration-inducing tracks and is single-handedly responsible for turning many sequences into instant classic moments.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Rocky features an interesting cast in Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers & Burgess Meredith, with all of them doing a terrific job in their given roles but it's Stallone who impresses the most and while he may seem off on few occasions, it's his performance only that made his character a cultural icon. Shire & Young have their moments, Weather does well as Apollo Creed while everything about Meredith is spot-on for the veteran actor steals every moment he's in.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Rocky is the greatest sports film ever made that remains unsurpassed in the reach of its influence on its genre, pop culture & cinema as a whole. Catapulting the careers of many, turning Stallone into an overnight sensation and spawning a franchise that went on for 30 more years, Rocky isn't without its complaints but the plethora of positives, passion & motivation that oozes from every frame of this classic easily brushes aside those little nitpicks. Packing a heavy dose of adrenaline & providing a huge shot of inspiration, Rocky comes strongly recommended."

His friend, Paulie, (Burt Young), work for a meat processing place and even he has to deal with his problems. One of those problems is Adrian, (Talia Shire), a shy woman who can't stand living with him because of his drunkenness. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed, (Carl Weathers), is looking for a competitor to fight for the nation's biggest birthday. His ultimate choice is, of course, Rocky. Creed thinks that Balboa is the perfect fighter. In order for Rocky to fight against Creed, he seeks the help of his gym manager, Mickey, (Burgess Meredith), an angry and tough man who is willing to train Rocky for the big fight.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with a lot of great screen performances. The one aspect that strike me the most was Sylvester Stallone. This is a great performance from him and the first of many. One thing that I like about Stallone is the way that he writes Rocky and all of the other characters' dialogue. He tries to create a likable person out of himself and with that writing, we can actually see ourselves being with these people. Rocky Balboa is a wonderful character. He has a heart of gold. In addition, there is a very nice and sweet love story between Rocky and Adrian that adds flavor to the movie. Burt Young and Burgess Meredith also make the movie work because their characters to me, were one of the reasons why Rocky's world is so upset and angry. It's not the characters' fault. It's the way their world is affected by America's problems. These characters are not happy living in this competitive world of fighting over what they want or what they can get. Rocky isn't about the central character. It is more about people rather than the main character.<br/><br/>The famous scene in which Rocky runs up the stairs while ""Gonna Fly Now"" plays in the background is perhaps the most powerful and most inspirational scenes in movie history. In my opinion, whenever I see a sports movie, I think of them as being inspirational. I always find that the main character is always pushing his way through tough times. The final fight scene in the movie between Rocky and Apollo is the second best scene in the movie because by the end, you feel as though your emotions are drained. By that time, the audience who seen this movie in the movie theater were probably cheering with joy and crying with emotion. Inside, I was cheering and devastated with joy. <br/><br/>It's a shame that Rocky is the only great movie that Stallone has written and starred in. Because of that, Stallone fell into a losing streak with very bad films and sometimes embarrassing. This movie proves that Stallone is perfect for the role. He knows what comes out of Rocky Balboa. He knows that people will like this character and always stick to him because he is friendly and also, lonely. But above all, this is the movie that made Stallone a star in the first place. It's great to see him land a juicy role in a major motion picture. ★★★★ 4 stars."
"mrrockey","8","1","1","28 March 2014"," One of My Favorite Sports Dramas
","Sports dramas, what can you say about them? Well, I'm not the biggest of them. For me, the majority of sports dramas are boring, overly- schmultzy, and extremely cliché. I won't say that sports dramas is a sub-genre that I really DESPISE as there are films that I DO like in there but for me, if Hollywood just unexpectedly stopped producing sports dramas in general, it wouldn't be that big of a loss for me. However, there is ONE film in the genre that I happen to really love, and that's Rocky.<br/><br/>If you are one of the five people who haven't seen this film, here's a basic rundown of the plot. Rocky Balboa is a small-time boxer and part- time collector for a loan shark living in Philadelphia. His friends include Paulie, a meat-packing plant worker with alcohol problems and violent mood swings, and Adrian, a shy pet shop clerk who's also Paulie's sister. Rocky seems to be going nowhere in life as he's constantly in need for money, winning fights by the skin of his teeth, and nobody seems to see him as anything but a bum. But when World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed's opponent Mac Lee Green drops out due to an injured hand, Creed decides to pick an unknown local as his opponent and he chooses Rocky because of his nickname, the Itallion Stallion. Will Rocky go the distance and prove to the world he's not a bum? Or will Creed decimate him in the ring?<br/><br/>I think the reason I like Rocky so much is because of hopeful and optimistic it is while still feeling like a real story about real people. A lot of sports dramas feel too sanguine and schmultzy for me to believe that this could happen in real-life but this movie perfectly balances out being optimistic while still having a sense of grit and realism to it that helps us believe in the story. The first half of the film feels very SLOW, and very urban. We get some really LONG takes of Rocky roaming around the streets of Philadelphia that makes the film feel sorta like a documentary in a way and the overall cinematography is very simple and static. This helps ground the film in a realistic style as opposed to it if it was very stylized and creative. They also do a very good job of making you FEEL Rocky's current place in life by having him interact with various people in scenes that don't always have a point in the PLOT, but make you feel just as directionless as Rocky is in his life. When Rocky's preparing for his fight with Apollo, the movie feels a lot more focused in its structure, just like how Rocky now has a purpose in life. The way the film is <br/><br/>But what made this film CONNECT with so many people and become a classic was the characters. Rocky is a very real and relatable character because he's not portrayed as an action hero he later would or even a particularly smart guy, he's just an oaf with a good heart. Stallone could've played him really emotional and whiny the whole time but instead, he keeps most of his pain inside which makes for a much more subtle and nuanced performance. Paulie is many ways, what Rocky could have been if he unleashed his frustrations in violent mood swings. He's often angry and moody because of how frustrated he is with his life's shortcomings and he feels his sister owes him because he's the only person she can communicate with and feels unappreciated by her but deep down, has a heart of gold. This character could've just came off as a huge douche but the way Burt Young plays him, makes him likable despite some major flaws in his character. Adrian is kinda like Rocky in a way as he's often unsure of himself and has self-esteem issues but when pushed by someone like Mickey and loved by Adrian, becomes unstoppable. Just like how she's shy and quiet at FIRST, but once given some love, becomes a very strong and in-control woman and Talia Shire plays her part BEAUTIFULLY. She came off very nerdy at first but she changes believably to a very strong woman by the end of the film. Rocky's trainer, Mickey, is very gruff and blunt about his thoughts and feelings a lot of the times but he's also the father figure to Rocky as he's the one who motivates him the most when he needs it outside of Adrian and his gruffness can be interpreted as ""tough love"". All these characters were very likable and compelling in their own right.<br/><br/>And then, there's the score by Bill Conti, which has now become a part of any gym trainer's MP3 playlist and for good reason too. The music in the film is very powerful, it starts out being very subdued and sad when Rocky's aimlessly wandering through Philly but then it becomes bombastic and triumphant when Rocky's getting ready for the big fight. It has this sorta brass fanfare sound to it that fits boxing very well and the softer piano pieces perfectly compliments Rocky's downbeat lifestyle.<br/><br/>Lastly, I want to touch upon the final fight. Whereas most movies would try to make this scene as exciting as possible. Here, Rocky just ENDURES the entire fight and doesn't do much damage to Apollo until the very end where he manages to bruise his ribs. He doesn't even win the fight in the end, Apollo won due to a split decision. I love that Rocky doesn't win at the end because he doesn't HAVE to, he already proved that he's not a bum and that's what the whole movie's about. The script's very consistent in this sense.<br/><br/>Overall, Rocky is well-directed, well-written, has great characters, and has a great score. It definitely deserves its status as a classic. 8/10"

","When i first saw rocky about an year ago, i was touched. I was motivated. This movie depicts the life of an underdog who just wanted to achieve success in his life. He wanted to show everybody that he had the potential to become the greatest fighter and wasn't just another bum from the neighbourhood. This movie truly inspires me and millions of other people around the world. ""Never give up"". This movie boosted my confidence and encouraged me to follow my dreams. The other rocky sequels are awesome as well. I think if someone is about to give up something and he watches this movie, he would definitely stand up and follow his dreams.

","What can i say about Rocky.....Simply the greatest movie ever committed to celluloid. Writer & star Sylvester Stallones own life mirrored the movie itself so closely that you can feel every emotion & heartbeat as if it were his own & you get the feeling that the movie in essence wrote itself. To me the movie is pure poetry & one of the most beautiful love stories of all time. Filled with outstanding performances by a stellar cast Talia Shire,Burt Young,Carl Weathers & Burgess Meredith are all magnificent. As for Sylvester Stallone himself he produces a performance of such heart & soul it brings a tear to the eye..He is magnificent & in my opinion should have walked away with an academy award for best actor.The gritty urban streets of 1970s Philadelphia offer the perfect backdrop to the characters plights & the now iconic Mighty Micks gym & Rocky steps stand out in the midst of the drama.The music by Bill Conti is a classic score filled with sadness & triumph. The movie has everything....Heart,soul,pain,fear,love & laughter..A masterwork of cinema. Hats off to Sylvester Stallone & thanks for giving us Rocky."
"KnightsofNi11","8","1","1","27 December 2010"," Great film
","I never thought I could take Sylvester Stallone seriously, but I was wrong. Rocky seems to be his most sincere and dedicated role. It's also a role with much more depth than what Stallone usually subjects himself to, which isn't saying a whole lot considering the mindless tripe we see macho-man Stallone in, but I regained a lot of respect for the guy after seeing Rocky. It's one of the greatest underdog stories you'll ever see, following the story of Rocky Balboa, a small time boxer who is given the chance to make it big when all-star boxer Apollo Creed challenges him for a publicity stunt. Rocky takes this chance to become somebody and trains his heart out to beat Creed. It is a story of triumph and solid determination to overcome personal tribulations. It is an inspiring and well made film.<br/><br/>Not only was I impressed with Stallone's ability to act but also write. Rocky has a fantastic script which drives the film and gives it its very natural flow. There is a specific cadence to the dialouge which flows in a very consistent manner and never gets tiresome or dull. On the surface there isn't a whole lot to the story, but the script carries it in a very unique and compelling manner. There are some very memorable lines as well as very memorable scenes that have been ripped off, given homage, and parodied so many times since 1976. Probably the most memorable aspect of the film would be its main theme. The robust trumpeting theme gives the film its powerful and inspiring edge. We've all heard it before, and in the context of the film it is even better to listen to, and has even more of an emotional influence on the listener. Because of this great theme, Rocky amazingly makes the montage work. Montage scenes can be a cheap and easy way out of actually developing characters, but Rocky utilizes its montage scene in the best way possible. It makes for probably the most memorable scene of the film.<br/><br/>The script in Rocky is magnificent, but it's the characters where the film falls a little short. The character of Rocky Balboa is a very fleshed out and fully realized character. He develops very well and is written with the most care. Unfortunately, the supporting cast can't hold a candle to our protagonist. They aren't nearly as well developed and don't seem to serve nearly as significant of a purpose as Rocky does. The actors themselves do a fine job, but the characters are left a little shallow and slightly two-dimensional. By the end of the film it was safe for me to say that Rocky was the only truly compelling character in the film. This would have been a much bigger issue of Rocky wasn't the main focus of the film. Obviously he is, seeing as the film itself is called Rocky. The characters weren't so underdeveloped that it took away from the film, it was just an unfortunate circumstance that they couldn't be as compelling as the protagonist. It's really not something to complain endlessly about.<br/><br/>Rocky is a great film. What it lacks in supporting characters it makes up for in its fantastically deep and compelling protagonist, Rocky Balboa. The script is great and it gives a lot to a story that is relatively simple. The whole film stays exciting and kept my attention from start to finish. It also has an abruptly appropriate ending. It was one of those films where I was surprised when the credits began to role, but in no way disappointed. This is a true gem of the 1970's."
"moorepiper","8","1","1","13 December 2010"," Determination shows victorious.
","Sylvester Stallone plays the main character, ""Rocky"". Rocky is a local boxer only known to neighborhood residents and boxers at the local gym. He is an amateur with strong determination. Rocky was given the opportunity to fight heavyweight champ Apollo Creed, played by Actor Carl Weathers, known to be the best of the best. In accepting the challenge the underdog became the champ. Rocky believed in himself and conquered his dream. He stayed the course, stayed focused and never gave up. Unrealized to Rocky, the reason that he was not moving forward in accomplishing his dream prior to the Apollo challenge, was that he had no strategy and no proper training. He was never properly managed, just a man with a passion and a dream. When the manager from the gym Rocky attended learned of his opportunity to fight Apollo he asked Rocky if he could manage him. He knew Rocky had the potential to be a great boxer. He also knew that Rocky did not understand how to improve on the talent he already had. This task was now Mickey's (Burgess Meredith) responsibility. Through the course of the movie Rocky falls in love with Adrian Pennino (Actress Talia Shire) after pursuing her for a very long time, she eventually became his roommate. Paulie Pennino, played by Burt Young is Rocky's best friend and Adrian's brother. Paulie was very adamant about Andrian getting out of the house and enjoying life before she ""dried up"". After successfully forcing Adrian to go out with Rocky, Paulie's actions caused the two to become roommates. Everything Paulie did to and for Adrian was out of love and concern. The music in the movie is the greatest technique used. Sylvester Stallone became Rocky in this 1976 movie. To this day, there are certain songs that can be played and the first thing that comes to my mind is ""Rocky"". Throughout the movie the music and sound placed strong emphasis on Rocky's emotions and where he was at that point in his career. The music drew me emotionally into the characters and the movie as a whole. The lighting and angles were very impactful and worked together throughout the movie.The lighting created a sense of poverty in Rocky's neighborhood and within his home. The angles contributed to the effects of the lighting even as we watched Adrian's body language as she was a lady of very few words. Rocky is definitely a movie that shows that love will conquer fear, determination will conquer adversities and dreams do come true."
"kwaross247","10","1","1","17 November 2010"," Why such a low rating?
","The movie Rocky is an all time classic and the 4th greatest movie ever made in my opinion. The plot of the movie is simple, but it's really about the character, Rocky Balboa on his inside which is what makes it so good. It's also a love story, If a=Adrian weren't a character it would have been pointless. ""Rocky"" is a man's movie which you would think is a movie full of explosions and guns and people constantly using the F-bomb over and over...or something like that (ie: Die Hard, The Expendables, Rambo, Robo Cop, The Terminator) but there's just something about Stallone that makes every one of his movies at least feel like your watching a film like that. Maybe it's because of the boxing scenes. The writing, the directing and the action is top notch. Rocky is fun has a heart and has cool fight scenes. Rocky gets the ""one of the greatest movies of all time!"" award. If you haven't seen it rent it. If you have buy the most special DVD you can find.<br/><br/>10/10"
"khanbaliq2","10","1","1","8 July 2010"," An unashamed feel-good movie.
","The film tells the rags to riches American Dream story of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), an uneducated but kind-hearted debt collector for a loan shark in Philadelphia. Rocky starts out as a club fighter who gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship when the scheduled contender breaks his hand.<br/><br/>Rocky is an uplifting, likable underdog film that came after a traumatic decade for America, with an apparently average Ordinary Joe for a hero, a character who might have been a minor sidekick in an urban pre-war film. Stallone wrote himself a part with grit, wit and a little self-deprecation, and showed an indomitability in getting it made that recalled Rocky's unlikely rise through the ranks."

","""Rocky"" is one of those movies where you identify with the protagonist in some way. Everyone wishes for a chance to change their lives, but how often does that happen? Well, it happens to Rocky.<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa is a boxer who fights in local bouts in Philadelphia. To supplement his income, he takes a job collecting for a loan shark named Gazzo. Despite being involved in such a brutal sport and seedy occupation, Rocky is a decent human being. He trains at a gym owned by Mickey, who was a fighter in the 1920s. Mickey cares about Rocky, but sees him as a fighter not living up to his potential.<br/><br/>Across the street from the gym is a pet store where a girl named Adrian works. Rocky takes a liking to Adrian, but she does not reciprocate those feelings. It's not that she dislikes Rocky, she is just very shy. Eventually, a relationship blossoms between the two.<br/><br/>Rocky is friends with Adrian's brother Paulie, who works at a meat company. Paulie is one of those people who are just rude, and he is mean to Adrian in several scenes in the picture.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to Rocky, Apollo Creed, the Heavyweight Champion of the World, is looking for an opponent to fight after the original challenger pulls out of the contest due to a hand injury. The fight itself is to take place in Philadelphia on New Year's Day 1976, which signals the beginning of America's Bicentennial. After Apollo finds Rocky's name in a book of local fighters, he sees the possibilities. As a result, Rocky becomes the challenger.<br/><br/>After accepting the offer, Rocky is paid a visit by Mickey. He explains to Rocky that this chance is a once-in-a-lifetime scenario, and he offers to become Rocky's manager. Rocky does not believe that Mickey is being sincere, since he needed Mickey's help once before and did not get it. Mickey leaves, and Rocky starts yelling at him in a rage. He catches up with Mickey moments later and the two work out their differences. After a handshake, Mickey becomes Rocky's trainer, and the two begin to prepare for the big fight.<br/><br/>The cast deserves praise. Stallone pulls double duty as actor and writer, and succeeds on both counts. Talia Shire is good as Adrian. Carl Weathers gives a fine performance as Apollo Creed. Burt Young is well cast as Paulie, and Burgess Meredith is terrific as Mickey.<br/><br/>John G. Avildsen, who directed ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Lean on Me,"" does a good job here. Rocky's running to the Art Museum with ""Gonna Fly Now"" playing is a scene that stays in your memory. That can be said about several lines in the film as well.<br/><br/>I cannot say anything negative about this movie. It is well done and you should see it."
"pimprp","10","1","1","11 April 2010"," An 8.0 is way too low for this film!
","Despite horrid sequels, ""Rocky"" is one of the most influential films of all time and should be, without a doubt, on the top 50 greatest films list. Putting it below 200 is just ridiculous. It has superb acting, a great story, and a phenomenal iconic following. Also, it can relate to anybody because everybody has been the underdog at one point. Maybe not the greatest sports movie of all time (I'd give that one to ""Raging Bull"") but it is the film that everybody references and spoofs. Featuring so many classic moments (eating the raw eggs, pounding the meat, etc.), its the typical underdog story that was made before it was typical. Every other story or film made nowadays involving somebody being the underdog is just a child of this film and how powerful and moving it is. In my opinion, the silly sequels (mainly 3, 4 and 5) have given this film a bad name and a bad reputation. Definitely a pure cinematic masterpiece, Rocky also won 3 Oscars, including Best Picture, which many of the films that are ahead of it on this list haven't even came close to. One reason why this film is great is because it came from Sly's heart (he had a struggling life and this film was his million to one shot, quite possibly one of the reasons why this is one of the few films he acts well in). The rest of the films in this series are made for money, which is the only thing they have going for them."

","A crowning achievement that, amongst other accolades, earned the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1976, ""Rocky"" tells the story of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), a washed-up boxer who serves as a strong-arm for a loan shark by day and fights for cash in dingy clubs by night. When flashy heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) challenges him to fight, Rocky finally has a chance to prove to himself and the world that he is still worthy. With the aid of an aging trainer (Burgess Meredith), a hot-headed but loyal friend (Burt Young) and a mousy pet-store clerk, Adrian (Talia Shire) Rocky goes the distance in a bid at self-redemption.<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa's rags-to-riches story echoes that of Sylvester Stallone's professional career. A virtually unknown at the time, Stallone was propelled to superstardom following the film's success at the box office, and got his foot in the door not only as an iconic action hero, but also as a prolific writer/director (he would later go on to direct four out of five ""Rocky"" sequels while writing and starring in all of them). His portrayal of the titular character earned him an Oscar nod, and it's easy to see why. Charismatic and ultimately human as the underdog hero, this is the stuff screen legends are made of.<br/><br/>The script, written by Stallone himself, is focused more on the everyday life of Balboa and less on the sport itself. A boxing film with very little boxing, ""Rocky"" is more of a character piece where we spend the bulk of the film getting to know and sympathize with our lead so that when the third act kicks in with a rousing montage and a whopper of a fight, you're cheering him on every step of the way. The film is aided by a nostalgic soundtrack and a slight-of-hand by director John G. Avildsen. Avildsen could very well milk the sappiness at hand, but instead, keeps the film feeling raw and real, yet inspiring at the same time.<br/><br/>""Rocky"" is, in a nutshell, a classic for the ages. It's easily Stallone's finest film and certainly had an immense impact on pop culture. Even if you don't particularly appreciate boxing or any sport for that matter, you'll find it to be a worthy, involving and inspiring underdog tale. ""Rocky"" is a true knock-out, time and time again."

It's about the world we live in, a world in which today you are notorious and tomorrow nobody knows who you are.

Rocky did just that, he had nothing to lose and everything to gain. It may seem like an easy decision, but I guess there's no pleasure in meeting the heavyweight champion in a 15 round of boxing, match.<br/><br/>I will always respect Sylvester Stallon for giving life to this amazing film. He was the first one to say: Hey what if we do this? and for that we deserves all the praise.

","As a teen, ""Rocky"" was my favorite movie. It was, in fact, the first movie I saw without my parents. In college, I ran up the Philadelphia Museum of Art's stairs a la Rocky.<br/><br/>The David vs. Goliath theme is so appealing to a student that I thought over the years that I probably overrated the movie and ignored many of its flaws. That judgment was reinforced by my knowing that endless sequels had made Rocky a caricature and Sylvester Stallone did not become a quality actor. In retrospect, I thought the characters were too broad and stereotypical.<br/><br/>A few days ago, I analyzed the movie for the first time. I was stunned. I completely forgot how good the beginning of the movie was!! Director John Avildsen did a superb job of conveying the grittiness of Rocky's Philadelphia neighborhood and the sadness and despair of his life. I was interested in the character from the start as he fights for a $50 prize, roams the neighborhood alone, and is thrown out of his locker because he failed to fulfill his potential.<br/><br/>Stallone is outstanding portraying Rocky as tough and dumb, but likable. He refuses to break the thumbs of a man who could not pay his loan shark boss and tries to help a man lying in the street and a troubled girl. Frankly, I did not recall the depth of Rocky's kind-hearted tough guy character.<br/><br/>I didn't forget the excellent conflicts and dialogues between the major characters  Rocky, girlfriend Adrian, her brother, manager Mickey, and boxing champ Apollo Creed. However, the scenes depicting Rocky and Adrian's first date were even better than I recalled because Talia Shire is very convincing portraying a woman afraid to be with a man and Stallone's pangs of loneliness on Thanksgiving and awkwardness around women are very endearing.<br/><br/>I must admit, though, that I recalled Rocky's rejection of Mickey's offer to manage him as a dialogue. In fact, it was two monologues  and the movie's best scene. Each monologue brilliantly captured the talker's frustration that no one had ever helped him achieve his goals. Mickey spoke first, begging Rocky for a chance at age 76. Rocky responded by essentially kicking him out of his apartment and venting at a door. The scene meant more to me in middle age than it did as a teen.<br/><br/>But, ""Rocky"" is definitely flawed. I found Adrian's post-first date transformation from a near mute afraid to enjoy life to a vibrant, articulate woman now that she no longer wears glasses as absurd as I did in 1976. And how did her vision improve? Contact lenses were costly then.<br/><br/>There are two boxing-related flaws that I didn't notice in 1976. One is that I've always thought the match was on July 4 and Rocky trained like a maniac for seven months. Since the match was on Jan. 1, his transformation into a freakishly-conditioned Superman is less plausible.<br/><br/>I've also always thought that Creed won easily because the announcers were astonished that Rocky stayed on his feet. I never noticed that the result was actually a 2-1 decision. The focus at the end of the movie was rightly Rocky lasting 15 rounds and then looking for Adrian rather than listening to the result. The fact that the match was actually close detracts from the excellent ending.<br/><br/>""Rocky II"" was pointless. ""Rocky III"" was better than ""II,"" but essentially about a celebrity that I didn't care much about. I never watched the others, but it's refreshing to know that the first ""Rocky"" was as good as I remembered it. I gave it a 9.<br/><br/>ZWrite"

","Certainly the best boxing film i have ever witnessed, pouring out a very good heart warming story, nice and interesting characters that you can never get bored of and a strong emotional flow as the film progresses.<br/><br/>This is a true and visual 20th century Gladiator movie, fighting for what is right. It's the quite sleeper of 1976, but created masses of critical attraction, which well deservingly paid off for a bold and emotional drama about one mans rise to stardom, i.e. Sylvester Stallone and the character he plays in the film - ROCKY.<br/><br/>It is certainly true, that Rocky was born and bred in three and a half days, with Stallone pending the script and his then wife typing it up. Which reverses the phrase ""slow and steady wins the race"" Despite being written and typed in the 3 and a half days, Rocky has become a movie experience not wanting to forget. Leaving you feeling ""wow, what an achievement"""
"johno-21","9","1","1","25 July 2007"," The little story that could
","I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and I've seen it several times over the years as well as just recently for the first time in along time. It holds up well and is a remarkable film in many ways. It's creation and success is as improbable as it's story. An unknown struggling actor with tough guy looks writes a screenplay about a struggling boxing club fighter who is somehow given a chance to make the most improbable leap imaginable; a shot at the heavyweight championship of the world. Syvester Stallone wrote the story after seeing a fight between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner. Wepner was a club boxer known as ""The Bayonne Bleeder"" who worked as a liquor salesman to make a living. In a boxing stunt to give an unknown a chance with a champion, a fight was arranged between he an Ali. The fight was expected to be a brief one with Ali hardly working up a sweat but Wepner went the full 15 round distance and even knocked Ali down once in the fight. In Rocky Stallone plays the title role of a club fighter who works as a collection enforcer for a loan shark to make a living. He's a sensitive guy behind his tough exterior and has a crush on the mousy pet shop sales girl Adrian played by Talia Shire. Burt Young is Paulie, her brother. Burgess Meredeth is Mickey, the owner of the gym where Rocky fights. Carl Weathers is Apollo Creed the Champ who wants to give an unknown from the streets a chance to fight him. Rocky gets selected for the chance and Mickey trains him for the match. Meredeth was the best known of the cast at the time of the film. Shire was known for her recent supporting roles in The Godfather I and II but only for those roles and here is an opportunity to break from the Godfather. Stallone, Young, Weathers and the rest of the cast were relative unknowns. Shot on a small budget and in a 30 day shoot schedule it would make 50 times what it cost to make it during it's initial North American theatrical release and go on to be nominated for an incredible 10 Academy Awards, winning two of the biggest in Best Picture and Best Director and a third for Best Film Editing. John Alvidson who had some critical success with Joe and Save the tiger get an Oscar for his direction. Scott Conrad and Richard Halsey early in their careers get an Oscar for their editing. James Crabbe is the cinematographer. Among the Academy Award nominations Rocky beat out a strong field that included Network, Taxi Driver and All the President's Men for Best Picutre. Stallone in his two nominations for Best Actor and Original Screenplay lost out to film veterans Peter Finch in Network and Paddy Chayefsky's Network screenplay. Young and Meredith may have canceled each other out with two of the five nominations for Best Supporting Actor and Jason Robards won the Oscar for All the President's Men in a strong field of nominees that also included Luarence Olivier and Ned Beatty. Meredith should have won the Oscar for his memorable performance. Shire lost out to Faye Dunaway in Network for Best Actress. This film of course went on to launch a franchise of Rocky films for Stallone but I would have preferred no sequels to this story. Just let it stand as it is as the little story that could. This is a very likable film filled with memorable scenes and duologue and shot on location in Philadelphia with a gritty look. It's worth a look if you've never seen it and worth a revisit if it's been awhile since you've seen it last. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10."
"redryan64","10","1","1","25 July 2007"," Stallone goes the distance in Life as ROCKY did the same on the Big Screen!
","The Boxing Film has long been a favored genre of the Hollywood output. Dating back to the earliest days, there has been a fascination with the fictionalized accounts of the 'Sweet Science. Hence, we have been treated to the likes GENTLEMAN JIM (Errol Flynn), THE GOLDEN BOY(William Holden), THE CHAMP & its Remake(Wallace Beery/Jon Voigt). We have also seen the Darker Side of Life in CHAMPION (Kirk Douglas), THE HARDER THEY FALL (Humphrey Bogart,Rod Steiger, Jan Sterling) and REQUIAM FOR A HEAVYWEIGT (Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason & Mickey Rooney). <br/><br/>Boxing has long been a metaphor for life itself and so this screenplay represented the status of Mr. Stallone's own life and Acting Career. At 30 years of age himself, he held out to giving an okay to Producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler to do the film. The producers wanted Robert Dinero for the role, but old Sly was banking on this project's being his own long shot,to put his own career into the Success column.<br/><br/>This is not supposed to be much of a film, this ROCKY, it is not a Blockbuster or any ""critically acclaimed"" High Brow slice of Cinematic Art. But, lo and behold, the story holds onto the audience like a Pit Bull! All can watch it together as a Family Unit.And though it contains some very graphic and violent scenes in the Prize Ring, all is acceptable. Great care was taken here (as it was in the following Rocky Movies) to present a long, drawn-out Championship Bout, which would be somewhat fanciful, yet remain faithful to the realism that was a hallmark of the film.<br/><br/>The film is shot mainly on location in Philly. The cityscapes selected gives the viewer a look of beauty.We all have those bumps in the road of our daily lives.<br/><br/>Sly was right, for he was the guy for his own Script*. He did not have to 'get into this character's head, because this character originated in the fertile Stallone imagination. In one sense, Rocky was Sly. <br/><br/>Some in the Boxing Fraternity were critical of the film's portrayal of the physical training and the lack of emphasis on sparring. With this one criticism considered and dismissed as minor, we can fully appreciate the scenes of roadwork, resistance exercise, speed and heavy bag work. The running scene done on the waterfront is of particular note, as Stallone really went all-out, hitting high gear in sprinting, with the water and the docked ships providing a most picturesque back drop.** <br/><br/>Tallia Shire played Adrian, a shy girl, who has grown up in a very quiet manner. She has not had much, if any, social life. She yearns for fulfillment in a drab existence of caring for self and working in a pet store, as a sort of female roustabout/cage cleaner/animal keeper. She lives in the same old family house with her older brother, Paulie.<br/><br/>Paulie (Burt Young) is a heavy set, apparently powerhouse of a guy, who is employed in a meat rendering plant. He is greatly dissatisfied with things as they are and constantly shows these feelings. For example, he wants to better himself by getting a job like Rocky's as a collector for the 'Juice Man', Gazzo, powerfully portrayed by the very talented, the Late Mr. Joe Spinnell.*** Carl Weathers brings the Heavyweight Champion of the World to life. His portrayal is as right on the mark as his muscular physique and obvious athleticism is obvious. (He was a College Footballer as well as having done a stint in the NFL with the Oakland Raiders. He was a linebacker.) Carl's ""Appolo Creed"" is at once cunning, serious, and flamboyant. He is at once a dedicated, Spartanesque athlete, but also a business man. He is the one who makes the Match, even insists on his opponent be Rocky Balboa,""The Italian Stallion."" Other cast members include: Thayer David appeared as, the splendidly dressed Promoter Miles Jergens. Tony Burton is Apollo's trainer. We also have a great number of other well traveled supporting players in the cast. Two of our personal favourites are,Billy Sands (veteran of TV's SGT. BILKO and McHALE's NAVY) is cast as a Ring Announcer and George O'Hanlon (for years he was Joe McDoakes in all of those Warner Brothers Comedy Shorts as well as the voice of Hanna-Barbara's George Jetson on THE JETSONS, both on TV as well as the Feature Film.) Sylvester Stallone is certainly a loyal guy, as he has several friends and family in the film . His brother Frank Stallone, Jr. has his vocal group in it as the street singers(""You guys get better every year!"") and Frank Stallone, Sr., their father appears as a time keeper. Why even Rocky's Dog, Butkus was the real life pet of Mr.Sly's.<br/><br/>ROCKY has been called an old fashioned ""B"" Picture.**** Well, maybe so, but if it is true, let Hollywood give us more, and more and more and more..........................., en ad infinitum! <br/><br/>* The right guy, indeed! The whole story would seem to be an allegory, a metaphor for Life Itself, and in this case, Sly's Life and Career.<br/><br/>** The action of the scene appears to have been augmented by some certain camera movement, making the whole sequence even more spectacular! <br/><br/>*** The late Mr.Joe Spinnell had such fine talent. Having been discovered at an open casting call for THE GODFATHER by Francis Ford Cappola.<br/><br/>**** The story was inspired by real life incidents. Chuck Wepner, as Journeyman Heavyweight Boxer, got a chance to fight Mohammed Ali for the Title. It was March 24, 1975 in Cleveland."

P.S Great soundtrack!!"
"moviebuff01","10","1","1","20 July 2007"," Rocky (1976)
","People have often asked me, ""What's your favorite movie ever?"" Without any hesitation my answer is Rocky. The inspiration behind this film is an interesting one. In 1975, there was a boxing match world the World Heavyweight Championship between Muhammad Ali (champion) and New Jersey club fighter Chuck Wepner (challenger). Nobody gave Wepner a chance; everyone thought Ali would knock him in less than 3 rounds. However, Wepner fought hard and went through 14 hard rounds with Ali, until being knocked out in the 15th and final round. Wepner even managed to knock down Ali in 9th round. Now you're probably asking yourselves? What does this have to do with Rocky? Well, you see everyone is an underdog in some ways, just like Chuck Wepner and the title character, Rocky is no exception. This is film is a great underdog story.<br/><br/>The title character Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a Philadelphia club fighter, who really isn't making much doing what he's doing. Everyone, including his own trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) sees him as being a bum fighter. Outside of boxing, Rocky makes a living by collecting money for the local loan shark, Gazzo (Joe Spinell). Meanwhile, Rocky has an interest for his best friend Paulie's (Burt Young) sister Adrian (Talia Shire), who works in a pet shop across the street from the boxing gym Rocky works out in. Every time Rocky tries to talk to her, she doesn't seem interested, that's when he turns to Paulie to help him out. Eventually, Rocky and Adrian go on date on Thanksgiving. The highlight of that date is a wonderful scene where Rocky and Adrian go ice skating, and make a connection with each other. Soon after, they are considered to be a couple.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the current World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has a title defense coming up. However, his opponent ends up getting an injury that ends up canceling that fight. Now Creed and fight promoter, Jergens (Thayer David) are franticly trying to find a replacement opponent for Creed. They eventually find Rocky. Jergens and Creed's trainer (Tony Burton) don't like the idea of Creed fighting an unknown fighter. However, Creed is insisting that Rocky would be the perfect opponent as he's an underdog and America loves underdogs. Also, Creed claims it will be an easy fight, as he believes that will ""Drop him in 3."" When the offer is bought up to Rocky about the fight, he first declines. However, Jergens convinces Rocky to take the fight, and does.<br/><br/>Now, all the sports writers and fight fans, are wondering why Creed would pick an unknown fighter, which they feel has ""no virtually chance at winning."" However, Rocky believes in himself as does Adrian, who gives Rocky a huge amount of support. Rocky just wants to prove that he can go the distance. Can he do it? Rocky is a wonderful film. Stallone has done a great job at writing this underdog story. There are some excellent performances by Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Burgess Meredith. I'm not saying this, because it's my favorite film of all time, I'm saying it because it's true. There is even one particularly great scene that makes you want to jump up and cheers for Rocky. The fight scene is also very good; it plays out like a real boxing match, and doesn't go too over the top as a ""Hollywood fight."" Everyone is in some ways an underdog. Rocky shows that if you work hard, you can accomplish anything and be able to ""go the distance."" This is without question Sylvester Stallone's best film. This is a classic, and truly one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>By: Chris E.<br/><br/>Rating: 4/4 stars"
"loccomotive2000","10","1","1","4 July 2007"," Going the distance.
","I was born in the late 80s and never gave much attention to the Rocky saga. The underdog rags-to-riches story had been used so many times in the 90s; Rocky simply didn't have much appeal. With all the hype about this sixth installment raging around the internet, I finally decided to give this original a shot. On my first viewing, however, it didn't impress me much. I got pretty bored and tired of the insipid lifestyles in a rundown neighborhood that I wasn't paying attention to some of the scenes.<br/><br/>A few days later I came across an article saying that Sly Stallone got drunk for a scene because they could only do one take of it and he didn't want to mess it up. It was during the night before the fight, where Rocky was confiding his fears and ambitions to Adrian. I revisited that scene and watched all the way till the end. This is the time I use the words: It was a knockout. Rocky reminded us what life is all about; taking a shot, and giving it everything you have. I got so pumped up that I watched 2-5 over the next two days, but only the second could come close to rivaling this.<br/><br/>The low-life characters Stallone created in this depressed environment could relate to just about anyone who has been down and hopeless. There's the life-wasting bum in Rocky, the shy and unconfident Adrian, and Paulie, an outcast of society, among many others. When Rocky receives his shot at the title, its compelling to see the way that people around him change, even his aging trainer Micky. It gave them hope and something to believe in, but ultimately it is down to Rocko to complete the Cinderella act.<br/><br/>In the end, Rocky not only restores hope to a society where dreams seemed distant and impossible, but earned the ever elusive prize everyone toiled for from the moment they dreamed; self-respect. A wonderful tale for the underdog in all of us."

A great movie."

","Rocky is the story of a down and out boxer who's actually really good. People don't recognize this, but finally a trainer takes him under his wing. Apollo Creed, the world champion boxer, decides to get an unknown to fight with him in the ring and chooses Rocky. Now Rocky has his chance at the top and he'll work harder than ever to be the champion.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is the fact that it works on so many levels. On the outside, it's a sports movie that will inspire even a king to become greater than he his. On the inside, it's a love story. Rocky and Adrian are one of the most memorable couples in film history and their love seems to be real. It's not just your average sports movie or love story though. This is the finest you'll ever see, even if you don't like boxing or romances.<br/><br/>The soundtrack probably has the most uplifting song you'll ever hear. ""Gonna Fly Now"" was exactly the kind of song that a movie like this needed. Today, everyone knows it and will hum the tune and even run up steps if they can find any. That's when you know you have a classic on your hands. It will stand the test of time perfectly and will live on as one of the greatest movies ever made. <br/><br/>With all of those combinations, audiences were amazed with the tale of Rocky Balboa's dream of becoming a champion and his friends who helped him along the way. There's something else that makes this movie work more than anything else before or after it. It was released around the same time when the United States was celebrating its 200th birthday. This is the kind of movie that helped promote the American Dream and showed that our country was still the best. It was quite a way to show patriotism and unity when we needed it.<br/><br/>Nowadays, it seems like Rocky is branded as another Stallone movie with so many sequels. Those sequels kind of ruined the reputation that Rocky should have, and we all learned how important a good rep is when we listened to Rocky's speech. So the next time you see this and think its just another excuse to make money, just take the film by itself and then you'll see how well made and well acted this film really is."
"ReelCheese","10","1","1","10 June 2006"," Magnificent
","Amid the seemingly endless sequels, it's easy to forget the power and inspiration of the original entry in the Rocky series. Sylvester Stallone catapulted into stardom after writing and starring in this low-budget tale of a down-on-his luck small-time boxer finally given his big shot. When an injury forces Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed's opponent to miss a much-hyped bicentennial bout, Creed settles on the gimmick of fighting the unknown ""Italian Stallion."" Though it's often ranked as one of the all-time great sports movies, Rocky isn't really about boxing. It's a fascinating glimpse at people and how they are shaped by circumstance; and how disappointments and aspirations collide. Stallone hasn't delivered as convincing a performance in the three decades since Rocky KO'd the box office competition."

","Despite the rushed nature of the filming process, this film still ranks as a very satisfying movie experience. Sylvester Stallone seemed destined to play the role of a down on his luck boxer. While the dialogue seemed to be made up on the spot at many points, the depth of the characters made up for such shortfalls. Rocky isn't just about some guy getting the shot of a lifetime, it's about the conquering spirit which seems to be inside each and every person, whether they believe it or not. While Rocky engages in somewhat shady practices, he embodies a person that seems to be stuck in time, forever caught up in a moment he can't seem to shake off. While some may dispute this film as the best of 1976, one cannot deny the power and new ground it broke. Instead of being the typical sports-feel-good-movie, it was more about Rocky simply showing the world he can do something more than just be a manual laborer. An awesome film to say the least."
"garbage king","Null","1","1","10 June 2001"," The original and still the best...
","After twenty-five years this flick never ceases to entertain me. Here, Stallone introduces one of modern films most memorable and well known characters in a film and managed to snare a truck load of awards and nominations, including best picture. In a formula Stallone would try many times over with little success, a man named Rocky Balboa is just another face in the streets of Philadelphia(Hope I spelt that write). He fights for the easy money and loan sharks on the side both careers taking him nowhere. Along the way he trys to win the heart of a shy woman in a nearby pet store Adrian in what's one of the underrated film romances (To me anyways). Stallone expertly builds up some good sympathy for Rocky before dropping the bomb that will change Rockys life forever.

The Rock sees it as nothing more than a chance to make some money but wishes to at the least, go the full distance with Creed which with the help of Mickey an old boxer turned trainer who's played perfectly by the late Burgess Meredith. Along the way he finds love with Adrian and even though he doesn't win at the end, you wont care because the movie manages to make you feel like he won bigger than Apollo ever did.<br/><br/>So, in case you haven't figured it out.

","What can be said about Rocky that hasn't already been said.  It is uplifing, well made, well directed, well acted, well scored and well, it is "" well "" everything.  This is the movie that started one of the greatest heroes and greatest careers in the history of Hollywood.  And it proves that in life and on the screen if you want something bad enough, you have to go out and take it, because no one is going to give it to you.  To tell you what this film is about and then give a small critique is rather pointless.  We all know about Rocky.  And my review is not going to do anything to enhance your like or dislike of the film.  By now, you either like the character or you don't.  You like Stallone or you don't.  So judge for yourself if this film is good or not.  I personally think it is great.  But for me this was much more than a film.  This is much more than a metaphor about life.  To me, this is a Bible for anyone who has a dream.<br/><br/>Stallone put his life on the line to get this movie made.  He believed in himself and he believed in what he had to say.  He was offered a huge amount of money to sell the film and let someone else play Rocky.  He held out and told them that he wanted the title role and even though at the time his wife was pregnant, they had very little money and he was hanging by a thread, he took that stand.  And the rest is history.  Could you imagine anyone else in that role now?  Does anyone really fit the mold that Stallone made for us? No.  And this film inspires me to be more than I am.  It inspires the dreamer in all of us to go for what we want and damn the consequences.  If I ever meet Stallone one day, I will personally thank him for making this film.  It changed my life forever and gave me hope to make my dream come true.  Rocky didn't stop until his dream came true and neither did Stallone. Why should I?  Why should anyone?"

","1976. A landmark year in cinema. And one of the most heavily contested Academy awards in history. No matter how you look at it, the 70s was the greatest time for American cinema. Scorsese, Coppola, Lumet. Some of the fiercest battles were won in the Academy awards. And it was an exciting time for moviegoers.<br/><br/>While Rocky may get a bad rap for beating out some of these American classics for the prize, the fact remains it still is a powerful, inspirational film about a man's dreams to be the best no matter what obstacles lie in is his way.<br/><br/>The question is does it still hold up after over 30 years? The character of Rocky is one of the most memorable film characters ever and has and established Stallone as a serious filmmaker. Many of the sequences have been engraved in film and popular culture namely the training sessions, meat boxing and the final battle and closing scenes. For fans, these scenes continue to cause great emotional instability no matter how hackneyed and clichéd they have become today. And this is one is one of ""the greatest underdog stories ever told.""<br/><br/>Stallone carries the film for it's duration - no other actor probably could have played Rocky. The character is well developed by Stallone who wrote the screenplay and was Oscar nominated for both his acting and writing. Stallone's mannerisms, raw, dopey acting style fit the character like a glove. The writing was poetic, heartfelt and honest but I did feel that there were some pacing issues and where the film lagged a bit. You could argue that Stallone merely played himself but he did a good job overall.<br/><br/>The other strength of the film was the directing for which it won an Oscar. It sets up the Rocky's neighbourhood well, the missed opportunities, the darkness and lost hope. The shades of a dream wanting to be borne into light. The pacing was unusually sombre, quiet and patient for a orthodox story which ultimately worked in favour for the director.<br/><br/>But I just didn't connect with this film. I thought the story was too simple and clichéd (in light of watching this 30 years after it's release and in hindsight of more recent boxing films) and there were some dead moments. I would have liked to see more about the fight and less about Rocky's soap operatic antics with his girlfriend and family. In the end I felt it too melodramatic for me add to that the (I can't help it) overdone music and story.<br/><br/>Plus it is impossible not to think about the other American films around this era that have been lasted longer and more potently as a comment on American life and the dream. All the President's Men, Taxi Driver, Network and Raging Bull. All these films have something to say have hopes, dreams, and ideals. While Rocky has captured the hearts of the viewers, it's contemporaries remain timeless and more perceptive in today's world."

","'Rocky' is a film about a boxer who goes to ultimate levels to become a champion of the ring. Along the way, he gathers confidence and meets a young woman who gives him the strength that he needs. This is a story of endurance and love, and it is one of the most quoted films of all time with the line 'Yo, Adrian! I did it!' There's also the famous clips of Rocky running, getting exercise to build up his endurance. This is filmed with the Rocky theme, 'Gonna Fly Now'. The story drags on a little bit, but those moments are worth fighting for. Not a bad film, and it does have a good choice of music and gives you a sense of hope."

","""Rocky"", the movie that I always hear of. One of my friends recently told me that I can't claim to be a movie fan without seeing the ""Rocky"" films, and I agree. I mean, who doesn't want a feel good movie that is goal oriented and inspirational? In the middle of the 70's decade, American movies like ""Rocky"" became progressively more optimistic, less concerned with social tensions. The happy ending made a comeback, as did such traditional values as the success ethic. Despite Rocky not being the sharpest tool in the box, he was tough and goal oriented and had that hungry look for the title. To be an average Joe off the streets and turned into the heavy weight champion of the world is incredible. I think that was what was so appealing to ""Rocky"".<br/><br/>This is Sylvester's best work in my opinion, and that's actually a compliment. He did a terrific job as ""Rocky"". I loved the chemistry between him and Adrien, a shy girl who just needs a little push and encouragement to be someone magnificent. ""Rocky"" is just a great all around feel good movie that makes you want to go the distance. Push yourself to do things you'd never thought, running at the crack of dawn, eating raw eggs, or even cutting your eyes to release the pressure. OK, maybe you won't do that, but Rocky did.

"Rocketeer_Raccoon","3","7","20","5 September 2015"," Boring, Boring, Boring and just odd.
","Sorry but I did not like this movie at all. I can understand that it's the story of an underdog boxer who has been given a once in a lifetime opportunity to have a boxing fight with the heavy-weight champion, a David and Goliath type story if you wish to call it that. Unfortunately the majority of this film is a load of boring drivel, it has a lot of unnecessary scenes and has some oddities.<br/><br/>First oddity, Rocky drinks 4 uncooked eggs for breakfast...OK that's just weird. Apparently it's something that bodybuilders do to get quick protein but uncooked eggs are not really safe to consume as one might carry salmonella and it would make more sense if you just cooked and eat them like normal as you will still get the same amount of protein. Second oddity, Rocky punches frozen meat hangings like a punching bag *facepalm*...what? What a stupid idiot, the first time he does this he's bleed his hands which I'm not surprised about but not long afterwards when he does a televised interview he punches the things again just to show off, he's like a dog that doesn't learn.<br/><br/>Adrian is a terrible character, she has no confidence and seems lifeless most of the time. Even her brother Paulie is weird and throws a cooked turkey out of the door just to make her go out.<br/><br/>One scene to mention that was completely pointless and unnecessary was when Rocky wanted to help this tomboy girl away from some street gang and once he walked her home she flips the bird at Rocky and says ""Screw You"". OK, what was the point of all that?<br/><br/>The only part of the film that's flawless is the famous training scene where you hear the Rocky theme tune while Rocky is running and runs to the top of the stairs successfully and putting his arms in the air.<br/><br/>Once we get to about the last 30 minutes of the movie we finally get to the fight itself between Rocky and Apollo. Unfortunately none of them actually won out right and realistically it was a draw even though Apollo wins by a judging decision and then Adrian cries out she loves Rocky and comes into the ring with him. I don't get it, there was absolutely no sense of accomplishment apart from being battered and bruised to oblivion with snot coming out of the nose. Overall the film is just boring and very dull, not a classic film in my eyes."

","grubby late-night fare achieved way too much success with a primitive story out of 1912.  A silly promotional song, laughable script and performances.  I have no clue why this picture, wearing its heart on its sleeve, ever achieved the critcal appreciation that it did.  This high -concept film is decently enough made, but it helped herald the wave of no -brain feel-good fare of the eighties to the present.  It is also incredibly racist, and seems to suggest that a boxing champ ""should"" be white, even though Apollo Creed does win the bout, the audience is supposed to be aghast.  More ghastly is this idiot in the ring who has his eyelid cut with a razor blade so he can keep on fighting.  I never bothered with the sequels, but Aki Kaurismaki's _Rocky VI_ ought to be even more laugh -provoking than this film."

However, ""Rocky"" is a rare film that glamorizes boxing (for the most part) and manages to deliver a film that you can't help but admire. Think about it. It was a small film, costing only about a million, and earned TONS of money and won the Best Picture Oscar!! No matter what you think of the later Rocky Films (as they got progressively worse) or the other films of Sylvester Stallone, you cannot take anything away from this tremendous achievement. It is a great film and it's amazing that it was made by folks who no one really heard about up until then.

","I wanted to rewatch this for a variety of reasons, but what tipped the scale were two ""ring"" movies that disappointed: ""Redbelt"" and ""The Wrestler.""<br/><br/>The reason for Rocky was the camera in the ring business. I remembered it as the very first movie that did this in a way that put you in the fight, that ""folded"" you into the cinematic space. Scorcese, for all his many faults, really did an amazing job by essentially remaking Rocky with clarity instead of the dullness of the Rocky character. Along the way ""Raging Bull"" really did set a new standard not just for ""in the ring"" camera-work, but a new vocabulary of relating between any two characters. Those 360 spins around two folks engaged in something special between them are the lowest form of this.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Redbelt"" and ""Wrestler"" were by two competent folks, and I wondered. So I went back to Rocky. I may watch the whole series. What we liked at the time, and still do is the folding of reality into the story. This is Stallone's story, even down to his romance with a Copolla. It is where we first ever in film see a steadicam, first on the steps and them in the ring. At the time it was mindblowing. Now it is ordinary and rough.<br/><br/>So what we are left with is the now sharper knowledge of how reality overlaps with the fiction. And the story of course.<br/><br/>For me, that overlapping is everything. Pay attention to the dialog, every word of which comes from Stallone. See how rich his own speeches are, especially compared to the well delivered but trite speeches of others?<br/><br/>This will be an adventure for me, marching through the Rocky and Rambo stuff. I expect to be left better off than Stallone is.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","4","11","12 September 2015"," Hasn't aged well at all
","This is ""Rocky"", a boxing movie that is gonna have its 40th anniversary soon and is widely considered a classic. Maybe my title for this review is even incorrect as I am not entirely sure if this movie could have been a quality film back in the 1970s and 1980s. It runs for pretty much exactly 2 hours and takes us on a journey with Rocky Balboa, a formerly very talented boxer, who just fights for little sums of money these days, and also a debt collector with fairly violent methods. The first hour of the film is basically about the title character's relationship with a friend and his sister, who he has been crushing on for a while. The two become a couple around the 1-hour mark, so the second half has more focus on the actual fight that is about to happen. The second half is also when Burgess Meredith and Burt Young have their great Oscar bait moments, even if I found them both a bit over the top, especially Young. This is mostly though due to the weak writing for the characters.<br/><br/>This film was a huge success that year with the Academy. It won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editing and managed to score many more nominations, including no less than 4 for the actors (one of them Stallone, who was obviously trying to channel Brando from ""On the Waterfront""). I think the acting is certainly not the worst aspect of this movie, but I am quite baffled by how much love they got. Also it is debatable if Talia Shire is lead or supporting. Anyway, this film has one big weakness: Stallone's script and it is really a joke that this one was Oscar-nominated as well. The first half is okay, maybe a 6/10. There are no moments of greatness, but it is bearable to watch in terms of the story and the acting. The second half, however, has some very bad moments and it all accumulates in the final fight where an athlete who is almost a complete nobody is on par with the best boxer in the world for 15 rounds, almost knocks him out in round 1. Are you kidding me? Imagine that happen to Mayweather or Klitschko these days? Not a chance. Realistically, he could not have survived a single round in there. Now the only thing that could have made it worse would have been Rocky actually winning the fight, but it was all so nonsensical that it almost didn't matter anyway. The ending with the big love confession was pretty cheesy and cringeworthy too. The scenes of Rocky fighting pig halves at the slaughterhouse or running alone with his arms up in the air were not really as epic or memorable as I would have liked them to be either. This film was Stallone's big breakthrough and he built a great career (including more Rocky, Rambo, Expendables...) on the film's success in the decades after that. Good job on him for doing so. However, ""Rocky"" is not even close to being as great or epic as it is considered by many. A definite contender for Worst Best Picture winner of all time. Not recommended."
"silverketchup","6","2","4","11 February 2014"," Not that big of a deal
","I hate to be one of those this-film-is-overrated people, but that is really the case for this film. Seeing this film for the first time (2014) I expected a lot more from it. I've heard so much about how amazing this film is and I just don't see it. It is a good film, but not great.<br/><br/>This is a fairly generic underdog story. The film is kinda boring until the last third and the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian doesn't really work. The way Rocky goes after her seems more like harassment than love. She doesn't show any interest in him. She feels really uncomfortable in Rocky's apartment and tries to escape but Rocky blocks her in. There's no way that two minutes later they're kissing. A big disappointment was Mickey, I thought he was going to be some awesome trainer like Mr. Miyagi but he's hardly in this film, and kind of a jerk. I'd heard of that one famous line of his ""You're gonna eat lightning and crap thunder,"" but I didn't realize that's basically the extent of the training he gives. The most iconic part of the film is probably the training montage (in which Mickey just watches him do push-ups and pull- ups) which is the best part of the film. I felt the words ""Trying hard now"" was actually referring to the filmmakers trying harder compared to the rest of the movie. Although without that song you have to admit all Rocky's really doing is running around and punching things. The final fight is alright, but fairly underwhelming. It doesn't feel like many of the punches are connecting, heck they don't even punch each other for a couple minutes. Fighting scenes can be a lot more intense than this, just look at the fighting in Warrior as an example.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film though. I think it was even quite good for its time, but it hasn't aged well. Maybe the film looks better in context with the other sequels, but standing alone this film just doesn't go the distance."
"bkoganbing","9","2","4","15 May 2009"," The Cinderella Film
","Sylvester Stallone had a dream and it was to get this film made about an enduring character he created, one of the most enduring in the history of cinema. In true Cinderella Man style Rocky guaranteed him a career and screen immortality. A whole lot like the protagonist ROcky Balboa in the film.<br/><br/>There was an Irish equivalent of Rocky during the early Sixties in real life, a boxer named Tom McNeeley from South Boston, just as Rocky Balboa is from South Philadelphia. McNeeley was a barely ranked contender, ranked in fact at all just to give him some kind of credence as an opponent for Floyd Patterson. McNeeley fought Patterson in Boston for the local gate attraction. Needless to say his showing against Floyd wasn't quite as good as what Rocky did against Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, showboating heavyweight champion in the style of Muhammed Ali.<br/><br/>And that's what happens to Rocky. Stallone is a local club fighter who also works as a part time enforcer for the loan sharks, but his heart isn't really into it. His heart is torn actually between boxing and his love for Talia Shire, the plain Jane sister of his friend Burt Young.<br/><br/>When opportunity comes you have to take it. For some reason a scheduled match between Weathers and another contender for the championship falls through. Several other name contenders aren't available, so it comes down to Rocky Balboa being given a once in lifetime chance in a bout to be held in his native Philadelphia like McNeeley's was in real life.<br/><br/>Rocky was the Cinderella story of the Oscars that year, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for John G. Avildsen, and Best Film Editing. Sly Stallone was nominated for Best Actor and Original Screenplay. He lost however to Peter Finch for Network. Burgess Meredith as Rocky's cornerman and gym owner and Carl Weathers were nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but both lost to Jason Robards, Jr. for All the President's Men. <br/><br/>My favorite in the film was Talia Shire, she is really touching as the Thirty something unmarried plain girl who grabs a last chance for love with Rocky. The role is so different from Connie Corleone in any of the three Godfather films. Sadly Talia lost to Beatrice Straight as William Holden's wife in Network.<br/><br/>John Avildsen winning for Best Director is great though I think the film is so much Stallone's own creation, he should have won for Original Screenplay. Avildsen never directed anything as good as Rocky before or since. In fact he directed seven years later one of my all time favorite trash films, A Night In Heaven.<br/><br/>Rocky is the great Cinderella movie of all time, the creation of its leading character who put enough of his heart into this film and gained a career for himself. None of the succeeding Rocky films came anywhere near this one for quality. And the story itself was pure Cinderella. How paradoxical and how great."

","Rocky (1976) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>I grew up with this film playing at least twice a month due to my father being a die hard fan. In fact, I also had to grow up hearing him talk about how he saw this film in the theater twenty some times. With that said, I believe this was my first viewing where I watched the film from start to finish. I had seen every inch of the movie before but this was the first time watching it through. I certainly don't think this was the best picture of 1976 but I certainly understand why it won since Stallone's screenplay perfectly captures what dreams are. The film is incredibly charming, sweet and uplifting, which I guess is all it needs to be. Not to mention the fact that it's probably the most iconic film in the past thirty years since everyone and their mother knows who Rocky is. The performances from Stallone, Shire, Young, Weathers, Meredith and Spinnel are all terrific and the direction pulls everything together nicely."

","The first installment in the Rocky series was the beginning of the inspiring era of Rocky movies. A low budget movie about a low rated boxer who gets one shot chance to prove what he is made of. You name the aspect of a movie and Rocky has done a wonderful job. Script, acting, music...almost everything.<br/><br/>Bill Conti has done an amazing job with the music. The music has become symbolic of inspiration and iron will. So much so that I see so many people exercising and gym-goers working out with the Rocky theme in the background. Gonna Fly Now played during the training sessions of Rocky is one favorite track of mine.<br/><br/>About Stallone. Stallone has proved himself as a good actor and a great script writer. For those who do not know, the script was written in a matter of three days after Stallone got inspired by a boxing match. Three days is too fast for an amazing movie like this one. Stallone plays the role of Rocky wonderfully and it is extremely difficult a task for me to imagine absolutely anyone else who could have stepped in his shoes and done a better job.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also does a wonderful job. Burgess Meredith, the cold yet caring trainer, Talia Shire, the immensely shy girlfriend of Rocky, Apollo Creed, the loud mouthed, slightly over-confident champion, everyone has done a decent job.<br/><br/>The boxing match was one amazing sequence. The brutality of the match and the punishment both inflict on each other and no matter how much Apollo tries Rocky keeps coming back up. So much so that Apollo occasionally gives a frustrated look of disbelief. That was one encouraging fight.<br/><br/>And of course, let us not forget the training session. As such the training sequence's major part is the music again. For a person with sufficient heart, this movie can be a life changer giving one tremendous inspiration and strength. After all, one of the purposes of the medium of movies is not only to entertain or educate but also inspire. This movie does just that.<br/><br/>Rocky Rocky Rocky!!!"

Or simply THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE!<br/><br/>""Rocky"" is quite simply one of the best movies ever made. A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits, and ""Rocky"" certainly stays with you long after the final credits have rolled.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Rocky Balboa, (Sylvester Stallone) a small-time boxer gets a chance to fight the heavy-weight champion of the world Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), in a contest in which he aims to go the distance. <br/><br/>If there is anything to complain about (and this really is nitpicking) it's all the empty seats during the fight, but that really is nitpicking of the highest order!! The story is filled with the standard elements, but the movie is anything but standard. It's a love story, but set in the run up to a boxing match. It's a movie that leads to a boxing match, but the outcome of the fight is secondary to the characters reactions to what just happened. It's got friendship, second chances, people who hate for no reason and the greatest underdog story ever told. <br/><br/>I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Sylvester Stallone, who has contributed some tough fisted, hard as nails characters over the years, is perfectly cast as the title character, he should be, it's well known he wrote the role for himself. Burgess Meredith is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Talia Shire is also awesome as the shy Adrian. Burt Young and Joe Spinell deserve praise for their performances too, as does Carl Weathers for his turn as Rocky's opponent Apollo Creed. Tony Burton does well with what he has too. <br/><br/>Favourite scenes (outside of the training and the fight) for me are Rocky and Adrian's first date and the ""I should have broke your thumbs"" scene. I also like a scene were Rocky's boss gives him $500 for training expenses too. <br/><br/>All this and I've not even mentioned the music. Bill Conti's score is absolute perfection. If I can't go in the ocean without hearing John Williams score for ""Jaws"" going through my head, I can't go for a workout or jog without hearing Conti's ""Gonna Fly Now"" but it's not just the inspiration trainin music that is great, check out 'First Date' on the soundtrack. Superb. <br/><br/>I was recently privileged enough to run the Rocky steps with my two kids and Philladelphia's number one Rocky impersonator Mike Kunda. You can't have any idea what it meant to me to do that!! He also took us on a tour of the movies filming sites. It was great going round seeing all the sights from this movie. <br/><br/>This is basically a fairytale story in a different setting and feels very real. and at the heart of the movie is the greatest love story in the history of motion picture. thats right better than Jack and Rose in Titanic and better than Ryan O Neil and Ali McGraw in Love Story. here are two people totally devoted to each other and stay that way through six movies<br/><br/>The script by Stallone is exceptionally good and completely deserved the Oscar. Rocky is a treasure of a character and Stallone plays him to perfection, he really should have picked up an Oscar for that as well.<br/><br/>All in All ""Rocky"" is a highly professional piece of work, with a good sense of heart and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment. Sly Stallone take a bow sir."
"whatsyourboggle","8","2","4","16 May 2005"," So much more than a fight for the title
","Some people will rub this off as just another standard fighting film, but it's so much more.. This movie is about a standard club boxer, Rocky Balboa. He's been trained for six years by Mickey before Mickey decides he's wasting his time, and gives away Rocky's locker to someone with more potential.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the world Champ, Apollo Creed, is preparing for his title fight, when news arrives that his opponent has an injury. Desperate to find another challenger, he stumbles across the Italian Stallion, our hero, Rocky. World Champion against a complete unknown - on Thanksgiving he decides to give a doubting underdog a great opportunity.<br/><br/>So there's the story. I consider it very involving, for such a simple premise. For Stallone, who hadn't written or acted in anything before, this is a mind-blowing movie. The acting really is top rate, as the doubting hero trains himself up to world class. Mickey gives him back his locker and seeing his new potential, takes him under his wing once more and trains him harder than ever. Along the way, his friend Paulie convinces his sister Adrian to go out on a date with Rocky, and they fall in love along the way. Don't be misled - this is not a romance film, but some of the sweet moments between them both really make the movie shine.<br/><br/>Even the casting is spot on - Mickey is played perfectly by Meredith, and I honestly don't believe a single character could be played by anybody else, especially Apollo and Mickey.<br/><br/>The soundtrack supplied by Bill Conti is worthy of your attention, and really adds to the emotional content of the film, as Rocky becomes a hero. The final fight is intense, but nothing really award winning in itself, except for the intensity. Be warned, you're certain to find yourself screaming at the TV to ""HIT THE SOB!"" If you've never seen a Rocky movie, and you're a fan of Sly, or of boxing, or of just a damn fine film, I highly recommend you buy this, and with the 5-DVD box set now available for an awesome price, there really is no excuse to go without the series that made Sly awesome."

Sylvester Stallone wrote an inspiring tale and powered it with his own solid acting and dedication to bring a cumulative result as one hard-hitting film that evokes all low dreams fellas. A small-time boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight a heavy-weight champion in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect. At the end he reaches the distance but the hardwork he had done deserved a lot more actually. Rocky might be a predictable film but the climax is always like a pumping station to get your nerves. I would have expected a victory at the end but it isn't there or may be it there but needs different perspective to look at it. In 2 hours of runtime the last fight hardly takes 8-10 minutes and the rest period still doesn't fail to keep engagement and pace at all. Sylvester Stallone looks so cute i mean i expected a hard narrow minded rough fella but he looks innocent unexpectedly. The choice of actress too looks interesting as she had to look sober at the beginning and beautiful later. Talia Shire suits perfectly in that role. Rest of the cast is good too and doesn't look dull anywhere. John G. Avildsen begins the film on a slow note, gives it a push after the first half and then blows up the real fire at the climax. May be that smooth going factor is missing but anyways the content is rich enough to survive the loss. Overall, Rocky is worthy enough to carry all the legacy since 44 years and hopefully it will continue carrying it. Sylvester Stallone as Rocky will remain immortal.<br/><br/>RATING - 8/10*<br/><br/>By - #samthebestest"

","Rocky has turned into a cultural icon for both boxing movies and underdogs alike, but what isn't talked about enough is how good the actual filmmaking is. It's full of terrific performances from pretty much everyone, heart wrenching scenes that really get you on this guys side and beautiful music to make what is already a great film into an unforgettable and iconic one. The final act is absolutely breathtaking and is easily one of the best films of the 1970s. Say what you want about the sequels, but this one takes the cake as far as filmmaking is concerned. Fantastic!"

","Rocky is a film about an underdog that's just trying to make it against the champion in boxing. All he wants to do is go the distance, this is a very compelling motivation and makes the Character so great. Rocky Balboa isn't very smart but he helps people out without a second thought. This character and his relationships make this movie amazing. Rocky's competitor, Apollo Creed is another classic character. Rocky is a love story, a boxing movie and a on top of it all, a motivational masterpiece."

","Rocky. Seek and do not give up. For me, the film was controversial. It was at the same time interesting in terms of the fact that you should train a lot and then you will get the result, and also really liked the final fight. But at the same time in the movie there were a lot of strange and stupid dialogs in which Rocky looked dumb. Perhaps this was planned."
"jogibbson","10","0","0","21 April 2020"," Beautiful, low key movie
","This movie takes a very understated view of its protagonist and its story. The magic of this movie is the moments between the ""moments"". Rocky's face as Adrian doesn't look at him. His trainer's last look at the bathroom that Rocky disappeared into. The people that populate this movie feel real. Rocky is authentically lacking the finesse that makes the following movies so gloriously cheesy (here's looking at you IV). What we have in this is a flawed character, built from the Philadelphia soul that framed him, shaped by the brutality of poverty, undercut by internalized misogyny, but, ultimately, a caring, good-hearted man who wants to be somebody. One of the greatest sports movies ever made."

","Rocky is a high quality movie it won the best picture at the oscars and it deserve it. It is a sport cinema masterpiece and Sylvester Stallone and Rocky is the underdog of the underdog story's. Sylvester was always poor and almost homeless in the 70's, he didn't had anything to eat. This is the best sport boxing drama of all time, I have ever seen. I would say ""Rocky"" and ""First Blood"" are the best movies in the franchise that Stallone filmed them. They started everything in his life and career. God I love this movie. The best drama and boxing movie I have ever seen (Along with Creed). The sequels were good but none of them were as comparable than the very first Rocky. I can tell Sylvester Stallone put huge efforts to make a great movie. And it was perfect in the end. Everything was so great and it was just worth the watch. Please go watch this movie......PLEASE. If you saw it already GO and see it again. I watch it every month and this movie is always great along with that montage. Worth every second. 10/10"

","I first saw Rocky when I was around 18 years old. Almost 16 years have passed since then. Rocky is not only a film about boxing. It's much much more. It inspires you to be a better person, the movie has so much to offer- compassion, loyalty, gratitude, love, hard work, discipline, friendship. I think if every kid in their teens watch this movie it would do them more good than any lesson from school, society or parents.

","If anyone out there wants an adrenaline rush, watch Rocky. I was too young to see it when it first came out, but I remember hearing my father tell me that he couldn't sleep that night after he saw it back in 1976. To this day he says that is the only film that had that impact on him. When I finally saw it later, it had the same impact on me. From the inspirational score, to it's climactic ending; this is my ""desert island"" film.
The scene that gets me every time? When the fight is over. The scores are being announced. And Rocky could care less about the results. Instead screaming at the top of his lungs for Adrian. The only person in his life who ever cared about him as a man and not the dumb punching bag he is perceived to be by so many in his life."

","Rocky Balboa is a Philadelphia boxer whose career in the ring appears to be going nowhere. Apollo Creed is the heavyweight champion of world who is due to face his next challenger in a fight in Philadelphia but with a matter of weeks to go the challenger is forced to pull out. Not wanting to abandon the bout Creed decides to give a local boy a shot at the title... that local boy is Rocky. At this point Rocky is working as muscle for a local loan shark and trying to get his friend Paulie's sister, Adrian, to go out with him. He doesn't think he has any real chance in the fight but trains hard in the hope that when the day of the fight comes he can at least last the fifteen rounds.<br/><br/>'Rocky' is always going to be considered one of the great boxing movies but it is so much more than that. It is a character study of a man whose life was never going to go anywhere till he gets that once in a lifetime chance. He grabs that chance and despite his doubts he sees it through to the end. Just as important as his boxing is the way his relationship with Adrian develops; it feels natural and avoids many of the expected clichÃ©s. His other relationships are also believable as the characters feel real rather than the usual Hollywood types. Sylvester Stallone does an impressive job in the title role but impresses even more for writing the story and getting the film we see made. The rest of the cast is solid; most notably Talia Shire, who is a delight as Adrian; Carl Weathers, who plays Apollo; Burt Young, as Paulie; and Burgess Meredith as trainer/manager Mickey. While the fight scenes are only a small part of the film they are pretty well choreographed even if it is occasionally obvious that punches aren't really connecting... they are close enough. Overall I'd recommend this to all film fans even if you don't like boxing; it is about characters not the sport."
"y2khan4","8","0","0","10 November 2019"," Rocky is love story first and a boxing movie second.
","So I rewatched this movie as an adult and I realize it's not a boxing movie at all. It's a love story between a guy who thinks he is dumb and a bum and an introvert girl who thinks she isnt pretty. Rocky doesnt even want to win the match. He just wants to go the distance. At the end of the movie after the match as people try to interview him, all he does is call for adrian. Even as people are asking for a rematch he doesnt want one. He realized in that moment all he wants is her. She is what makes him feel like he is not a bum. At the end of the movie very faintly they mention that creed wins by split decision but if you are not paying attention you cant even hear it over rocky and adrian telling each other ""i love you"" as the movie ends. This isnt a boxing movie. It's a love story."

Yes, it is predictable, but it is the build-up of the titular character that makes this so enjoyable, because Rocky may not be very smart, but he has determination and is an honest man.<br/><br/>Rocky's relationships with the local pet store girl Adrian and her brother Paulie and his his manager Mickey is also handled with expertise.

","The much beloved Rocky saga from Sly Stallone began with this film and it is indeed a great film, the best of the series in my opinion. What makes Rocky special is that it concentrates on characters, not sports. It would be disingenuous to say that the climactic boxing match is unimportant - it is, after all the movie's centerpiece - but that's not all Stallone's movie is about. There are only two fights - one at the beginning and one at the end. In between, every screen moment is used to develop Rocky as a person. He is not traditional hero material - he's crude, stupid, boorish, and has limited aspirations. Nevertheless, there's something likable about the guy, and it has its root in the gentle, caring way he treats Adrian. And it's this relationship that's the key to making Rocky's ending triumphant. He may lose the fight, but he gains so much more. This is movie magic at its finest."

","I stayed up all night watching every Rocky movie ever made and came up with a theory about the movie franchise:<br/><br/>After the 1st Apollo Creed fight Rocky was so badly injured that he slipped into a coma and every sequel is really a fever dream his damaged brain devised as a coping mechanism.<br/><br/>The reality is that Rocky is still unconscious and wallows away in an assisted-living facility in downtown Philly. Mickey took the prize check from the fight and ran off with Adrian. They live happily-married down in Costa Rica. Pauly stuck around and drinks away Rocky's disability checks. The real loser in this entire story is Butkus the dog. Pauly fed it a Thanksgiving turkey and the poor mutt choked on a wishbone.<br/><br/>Rocky's only contact with the outside world are the nurses, who really pity the fool. The Russian male nurse who works the night shift likes to sneak into Rocky's room and softly whisper in his ear, ""I must break you.""<br/><br/>Apollo Creed retired from boxing and joined the CIA. He disappeared in the jungles of South America while pursuing communist rebels. Rumors persist a trophy-hunting space alien killed him.<br/><br/>All of this is more plausible than the atrocious boxing scenes where human beings get battered in the head hundreds of times without making any attempts at blocking the blows."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Rocky is a sports drama movie that premiered in 1976. The movie is directed by John G. Avildsen and written by Sylvester Stallone. The movie stars Sylvester Stallone and Talia Shire. The movie is about an aspiring boxer that seeks to challenge a heavyweight boxing champion. The movie tracks Rocky Balboa's training and ultimate duel with Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>Rocky is a great sports movie. The movie hits many story beats and can rouse the audience into cheering on Rocky's training and duel. This movie has great pacing and structure that makes the movie tight and focused. The 119 minutes of running time is quick and Sylvester Stallone's performance as Rocky Balboa is excellent. Sylvester Stallone is able to portray the gruff and required focus that Rocky Balboa was called to.<br/><br/>Other than being a sports movie, there is not much to Rocky. This may disappoint audiences but it forms a movie that can be forgettable if one does not get involved with the story of Rocky. The movie ultimately does not have any grand transcending quality to it other than being an excellent sports movie. Any audience that does not care for sports will find the experience greatly lacking in the viewing of this movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'Rocky'.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"TheMovieDiorama","8","0","0","20 August 2019"," Rocky delivers a knockout performance with a script more balanced than the southpaw stance.
","The underdog story of all underdog stories. Allowed Stallone to climb more steps to stardom than Philadelphia's Museum of Art. Accumulated enough box office to make it one of the most profitable features of all-time. And, upsettingly, won the Academy Award for best picture back in '76, punching the likes of 'Network' and 'Taxi Driver' out of the ring. It was the start of the quintessential American dream, the sporting franchise to dominate the boxing sub-genre. And it all started with this. A drama so personable, with a surprisingly minimal amount of actual boxing, that it cemented itself as a timeless classic. Rocky Balboa, a good-natured working class boxer who trains/fights in small gyms, is offered a chance at the world heavyweight championship against current champion Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>The predictable archetypal plot structure that sees an actual human being, rather than a boxing machine with no personality, is utilised here yet again. However, never has it been fully optimised to this extent, when the prominent structure of the narrative is focused on one single character for the majority of its runtime just walking around the streets of Philadelphia. Stallone's screenplay magnificently conveys a bountiful amount of charm for his character. So many personable qualities, such as his kind-hearted nature that allows him to interact with other working class neighbours or his ability to provide redemption for his local trainer, allow viewers to bond with Rocky on an emotional level. Never, at any point, does Stallone embed melodramatic sentimentality. There's no clichÃ©d backstory. Nor is there any emotional distress. This is real life. The grit of the dank urban streets at night, the local lingo that provides connectivity for the character. He embellishes empathetic layers by simply making his character human, and it's incredibly refreshing to watch.<br/><br/>Avildsen ensures the camera is up close to Rocky's proximity to further enhance that personable style. After all, this is Stallone's pedestal, and just proves that when he is given the right material (his own that is...) that he has the capacity to deliver knockout performances like this. Stallone is Rocky Balboa. No one can replace him, and he made sure of that during the character's conception.<br/><br/>It's a film that has left a legacy on cinema and pop culture. The infamous training montage accompanied by the now legendary ""Gonna Fly Now"" theme song is an essential part of Philadelphia culture. The endearingly awkward love story with ""Adriannnnnn!!!"" that makes the ending absurdly perfect in every conceivable way, despite some aspects of their relationship being forced for the sake of having a love interest. It really is a timeless affair, and the final match against the overconfident Creed was a symphony of ""Yes, go on hit him where it hurts!!"" and ""The ribs! The ribs! Stay low Rocky, come on!"" from the comfort of my sofa. Unfortunately the choreography of the boxing matches meant that it was abundantly obvious the actors were not hitting each other. More fake than Creed's George Washington outfit.<br/><br/>Still, even if the punches failed to hit any flesh, the script, humanistic approach and central performance ensures that Rocky will continue to fight until the very final round. ""Greatest sports movie of all time""? Not quite, but it's ever so close to earning that title."
"Carrzinho","7","0","0","16 August 2019"," Plucky fighter movie
","Stallone writes and leads in this against all odds boxing drama. Rocky is stubborn, dumb and quite likeable. We get a decent foothold on the character, fighting in run down halls for a few dollars, working for a loan shark but with too much heart for his own good and down on his luck living in a beat up apartment. He's are largely popular figure in his community and desperate to date his friends sister Adrian.
All this is very convincing. The streets look authentic, as do the buildings and the circumstances. There's a lovely innocence to his burgeoning relationship with Adrian and a credibility to the bums that inhabit his world.
Giving a nobody a shot at the title is a bit of a stretch but a scene in Apollo Creeds office largely takes care of that. Later it sets an early bar for what became a ubiquitous montage and sucks you into really rooting for this underdog. The fight scenes are pretty darn good and again sets an early bar. The pacing is good as is the pathos.
However, the characters are fairly one dimensional like walking plot devices and when a character gets heated, they tend to over egg the performance.
At 2 hours it can feel at little sluggish early on but it kinds needs it to labour the mundanity of everyones lives. However, when it hits its stride it really rather zips along and the music is nothing short of inspiring. I really rather like the ending too barely acknowledging the result. SEVEN"

","Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three and a half days after watching Chuck Wepner take world champion Muhammad Ali to 15 rounds, a feat that no one saw coming. Stallone was also inspired by two boxers named Rocky - Marciano and Graziano, as well as Joe Frazier.<br/><br/>United Artists liked the script as a vehicle for someone like Robert Redford, Ryan O'Neal, Burt Reynolds or James Caan. But Stallone demanded to play the main character himself. This was a smart gambit, as he knew that producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff's contract allowed them to greenlight any project with a small enough budget (the final cost was about $1,075,000, with $100,000 spent on producers' fees and $4.2 million on advertising costs).<br/><br/>To be fair, it was an audacious gambit. Stallone had $106 in the bank, no car, and was trying to sell his dog because he couldn't afford to feed it. Instead of the $350,000 he could have made just for writing Rocky, Stallone wrote without a free and acted for scale. Don't feel bad for Stallone's dog - he ended up playing Butkus in the movie.<br/><br/>The other two main characters - Apollo Creed and Adrian Pennino - were difficult to cast, with boxer Ken Norton and Carrie Snodgress (The Fury, Trick or Treats) originally picked for those roles. Finally, Carl Weathers and Talia Shire (the sister of Francis Ford Coppola, mother of Jason Schwartzman and aunt of Nicholas Cage) were picked.<br/><br/>As well as having to pay off Wepner for basically taking his life story, Stallone also took the cattle punching scenes and running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art directly from Joe Frazier. Luckily, the story was continually worked on throughout filming, as originally, Rocky threw the fight so he wouldn't have to be part of the scummy world of boxing and Mickey was also incredibly racist.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Apollo Creed announcing a big fight in Philadelphia to celebrate the Bicentennial. Trust me, that holiday was the biggest thing ever back in 1976. He gets some bad news - his opponent is injured and he can't find another boxer who can draw. So he decides to give a local journeyman a chance - Rocky Balboa.<br/><br/>Rocky's never boxed on this level before. He has semi-pro matches in small gyms and churches when he's not working as a collector for loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell, who was a close friend of Stallone until the filming of Nighthawks; he was also Sage Stallone's godfather; you may know him better from roles in movies like Maniac and Starcrash).<br/><br/>Rocky meets with promoter George Jergens (Thayer David, Dark Shadows) thinking that he's just going to be a sparring partner for Creed, but then learns that he'll be paid $150,000. Soon, he's finally caught the eye of former boxer Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith, who is astounding in this film), a man who ignored him for years.<br/><br/>Rocky also falls for Adrian, which means he has to deal with her brother Paulie (Burt Young). Adrian fills the gaps for Rocky, becoming the only person that he can confess that the things people say about him actually hurt and that he doesn't feel that he has any chance to win. He just wants to go the distance to prove people wrong.<br/><br/>On New Year's Day, the fight happens. Rocky comes out in an ill-fitting robe with a meat packing logo on the back. Creed is dressed as Uncle Sam and continually makes light of Rocky before he's knocked down in the first round, the first time that's ever happened.<br/><br/>The fight is sheer brutality - Rocky needs an eyelid cut open just to see and Apollo has his ribs broken - but the end is indecisive. Creed is obviously the better boxer, but Rocky has more heart. As the final bell rings, Creed tells him there won't be a rematch and Rocky agrees that he didn't want one.<br/><br/>The result of the fight - a 8:7, 7:8, 9:6 split decision - doesn't even matter. All Rocky wants is to see Adrian and tell her that he loves her. He's achieved his dream and become a winner, even if he didn't really win. Instead, he's achieved so much more just by being who he truly is.<br/><br/>The iconic scenes where Rocky jogs through Philadelphia were shot guerrilla-style, which means no permits, equipment or paid extras. In fact, the scene where the grocer throws him an orange was completely improvised. The man had no idea that there was actually a movie being filmed.<br/><br/>Rocky was only the third film shot with the Steadicam (the other two are Bound for Glory and Marathon Man), which was integral when it came to capturing the aforementioned jogging scenes. In fact, the Philadelphia Art Museum steps came from the test footage Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown shot of his girlfriend running those steps to wow filmmakers. Director John G. Avildsen, who was prepping storyboards for the film, saw the footage and knew it would work.<br/><br/>Stallone and Avildsen disagreed on many parts of the film and nearly came to blows over the film's ending. Stallone thought Creed had to be the clear winner of the fight to prove that a victory for Rocky doesn't necessarily have to be in the ring, but Avildsen cut the conclusion to make it more ambiguous. They did agree to reshoot the ending so that Adrian came back into focus with her showing up to watch the final round of the fight. This ended up solving their issues with the final scene, as Stallone got his upbeat ending without really needing to decide who won the match.<br/><br/>Rocky was a major part of my childhood. I grew up in a town split between Eastern European and Italian families, where there's still plenty of anti-Italian racism even to this day. Having an Italian hero who wasn't a mobster meant a lot to me, particularly because Rocky was from my home state and not somewhere far away. As I've grown older, the story of a man who looks back on his life and sees the time he's wasted means more and more to me. So I get something new from this film every single time that I see it. It's pretty amazing that this character has survived eight movie appearances, changing to reflect his age and the time when those new films are made."

Revolving around a struggling man who never got dealt the opportunity he deserved. This film offered innovative action and film sequences, outstanding makeup special effects/sound editing and beautiful story telling.

","When people think about sports movies Rocky usually the movie that first comes up in the discussion and rightly so because Rocky is the greatest sports film of all time it has a timeless message and it's a story about how you don't need to win or lose it's about in Rocky's case going the distance against Apollo Creed the heavyweight champion of the world and rocky will do what ot takes to go the distance against Apollo.
The Cast includes Sylvester Stallone {Rocky Ballboa} Talia Shire {Adrian} Burt Young {Paulie} Carl Weathers {Apollo Creed} and Burgess Meredith {Mickey} I can't think of a better cast for this movie Rocky and Adrian's relationship feels so natural and they have some great on screen chemistry and another great relationship is the father/trainer bond between Rocky and Mickey they have some great moments and it shows how Rocky's hardwork and determinaton pay off in the end.
Bill Conti deserves a mention as well for doing the iconic score and theme for the movie and let's face it it is probably the most iconic score of all time because you instantly know that it's Rocky and also the going the distance track is also very good and something that i can listen to casually and still enjoy listening to.
Rocky is iconic it's such a amazing story of a boxer from Philadelphia who is down on his luck but he gets the shot of a lifetime and Rock doesn't want to win and he doesn't care if he loses either it's about going the distance and at the end of the day that's a great message you don'r always need to win and Rock teaches that if you put in effort and you are willing to give it you're all then you are a winner no matter what and that is why Rocky is so great and one of the best sports movies of all time."

","Rocky is a legendary film. Telling the story of Rocky Balboa, a small-time boxer who works as a debt collector, his life changes when Apollo Creed choses him to replace an injured opponent for a title match, he begins training for a match that people do not expect him to win.<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest movies of the 1970's. Starring Sylvester Stallone as Rocky himself, this film is a true underdog story, as it show Rocky going up against a champion who is a known name. Also, the story has some other memorable characters, from trainer Mickey, to Adrian and her brother Paulie, to the loan shark Mr. Gazzo, the characters are incredible, and the music is also good (especially Gonna Fly Now, the song that plays during Rocky's training, and would become the theme for the sequels). This is a great underdog movie that deserves to be watched."

","I remember watching this film as a teenager when I wasn't really into sports and had my face stuck on the pages of any given book I could find. I found myself back then so immersed in the world of prose, poems, plays and beautiful language, that I probably wasn't the right audience for the film, even given the fact that I was a pretty average teenage boy.<br/><br/>For me, the film had been about fighting, macho imagery, old-fashioned gender roles - about some sort of a way how men can express themselves and vent out the bad feelings. Not by talking, but beating it out for themselves, and not giving up if you get beaten. Granted, I did not grow up at the time when the first movie came out, and didn't get to experience the turmoils of the time, so that was also lost on me.<br/><br/>Almost two decades later, still hopelessly academic and romantic at the core, but also shaped by issues of employment, poverty, achievement and failure and by late discovery of the joys of gym and working out, the film looked different. It felt different. It still looks old, in sort of way I would recall my grandparents' house. The dialogue is on occasion so difficult to hear that you want to have the subtitles enabled. But it also looks timeless. You can try to understand that this, in the most American way possible, could somehow be genuine.<br/><br/>I never have liked Stallone as an actor very much, but I was pleasantly surprised that I really enjoyed him as Rocky. He is tender, funny, thick as a rock, but has a good heart. His constant boxing movement impacting his swagger way of walking and acting is kept up - he makes it look natural, like someone would actually behave like that. And somehow he doesn't look like a total tool doing it. It talks miles about Stallone's acting ability to make the character so believable.<br/><br/>And what about the dynamic with Adrian? I recall having not been very impressed with her character when I was younger. I had wanted her to have more fire, be less submissive, too unawares of the total effect the beliefs of the time would of course have on creating her has a character. Shy, controlled by a brother, lacking in confidence, 30 year old virgin with no prospects. How could she be anything else than what she really is? The pairing of the goofball and the shy kitten progresses slowly, Rocky not knowing when to give up, till Adrian emerges from her shell to take the leap of faith and see what's out there. The scene does seem a little bit off-putting with Rocky forcing her to stay, but this works with their hopeless together narrative.<br/><br/>And man, what about that tune? The fanfare, you know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>ADRIAN! - This scene brought tears into this manchild's eyes."
"Falconeer","8","0","0","15 July 2019"," A Real Story
","This is what people want, real stories about people that they can relate to. The original ""Rocky"" brilliantly captures one man's struggle so profoundly, so elegantly, that it is almost poetic. Stuck in a nowhere job, doing something for a living that literally makes him sick to his stomach, (who can relate to that?), Rocky is big and strong enough to work as a heavy...a debt collector for some nasty Philly loan sharks. The problem is, his personality doesn't fit with that kind of work, because he's a good guy, that likes people. So when he sees the opportunity to step into the ring with established Heavyweight Champion of the World, Apollo Creed, he takes his chance. Not for the opportunity to buy a Ferrari or gold chains or fur coats, but just so he can have a life that is better than the grinding poverty and hopelessness that he is living every day. He also has a good woman that he goes crazy for. Adrian isn't most people's idea of ""beautiful,"" but Rocky loves this woman, and knows that he wants to give her everything.
Rocky enters the competition, and with the help of his trainer Mickey, (today an iconic movie character) he soon begins to believe in himself, and that he can win. And by some fluke...he DOES win, making Rocky Balboa a true local hero. His win also ENRAGES the Champ, Apollo Creed, who becomes obsessed with a rematch, in order to reclaim his title. That brutal second fight, is the culmination of one of the most dramatically powerful films of all time. It's conclusion literally had people cheering and rolling in the aisles. When was the last time you have seen that happen? ""Rocky"" is great because it truly makes the point that any dream is attainable, if you truly believe in yourself. This movie also put the city of Philadelphia on the map. It's hard to think of Philly without thinking of Rocky and all the sequels. A special nod goes to the cinematography, which captures Philly in all it's dark, atmospheric glory. Followed by many sequels, all of them having a certain value in it's own way, and making a statement about the time in which they were made. And ""Rocky"" was a film that had something that today's movies just don't have...it has a heart, and a soul."

","Rocky is a classic movie that everyone would talk about and that I regret not seeing sooner. It's the tale of an underdog and underappreciated boxer, who gets the opportunity of a lifetime when he is challenged by Apollo Creed, the world heavyweight champion. The movie is a straight classic, I love the pacing that is starts off with, a slow, easy to follow pace that lets you know who this protagonist is. He's a relatable character, he has a job, he has a love interest, and a good heart.
The fact that everyone takes Rocky for granted throughout the entire movie and doesn't think much of him doesn't discourage the viewer. I just makes us want to see the character succeed even more than ever. The iconic song ""Gonna Fly Now"" and the iconic race up the Philadelphia steps are just the cherry on top of this treat of a movie. When Rocky succeeds in going the distance, I couldn't help but cry at the ending. Not of sadness, but of happiness. Knowing that he succeeded and won the heart of the woman he loved for so long. Sylvester Stallone clearly knew what he was doing when he made this character. This is a movie that gives me and perhaps anyone who sees it, hope that things can be accomplished, and that if you work hard enough, your dreams can come true."

","The Rocky franchise is nowadays considered to be one of the greatest film franchises one of all time. It's not so strange when you see that this series has been going ever since the 70's and it continues to this very day through the Creed films. In this review I'm going to take a look at the film that started it all, simply known as «Rocky»<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is small-time boxer in Philadelphia who works as a debt collector for a loan shark. Rocky is poor and isn't respected very well by the public. Despite working as a debt collector, he has a good heart. We see that Rocky is supposed to break a guy's thump, because the guy didn't have enough money for the loan shark, but Rocky refuses to do so. Rocky pursues a relationship with the shy pet-shop worker Adrian (Talia Shire), who isn't respected very well by her brother Paulie (Burt Young). Here we see good things and bad things that Rocky goes through in his life, but then one day, Rocky's life changes forever. The world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), decides to fight an unknown fighter, because his opponent got injured and can't compete the fight that Apollo spent a lot of money in the marketing. Apollo chooses Rocky to be his new opponent because of his nickname «The Italian Stallion». Rocky accepts the fight and starts training. Rocky's trainer is Mickey (Burgess Meredith), who before the big fight always criticized Rocky for wasting his potential in becoming a great fighter. But after Rocky accepted the fight with Apollo, Mickey changes his mind and agrees to train Rocky. The film then builds up to the big fight, but then it shows that it's not about winning, it's about doing the best as you can.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple as it's about an underdog boxer being challenged by the champ. But the film is about more than just boxing; the film is all about the characters, especially the main character. Rocky started out as a poor part-time boxer with almost no belief in himself. Rocky is a very relatable character who goes through many difficult obstacles in his life, just like real people. After the champ challenges him, Rocky gains more self respect and wants to show the world that he's more than just some street rat. The development on the other characters are also great. Adrain started out as shy and with almost no self-respect mostly due to her abusive brother Paulie. But after failing in love with Rocky, she becomes a much stronger character and finally stands up against her brother. Paulie is also a great character, despite being a jerk to Adrian. He's Rocky's friend but he isn't very happy with his life, which explains his abusive nature. Mickey is Rocky's mentor and trainer who cares for Rocky, but was very frustrated by the fact that he wasted his potential before the big fight came in to the picture. He also has some of the funniest lines in the film such as «You're gonna eat lightning and crap thunder». Apollo is a very arrogant boxing champion, but at the same time he's fair.<br/><br/>The music composed by Bill Conti is excellent. For the most part, there are almost no music in this film, but when we do hear the music, it's very effective. The dark tunes such as «Philadelphia Morning» and «Alone in the Ring» are great as they show the struggles that Rocky has to go through in this film but at the same time we have the more optimistic tunes like «Gonna Fly Now» which shows how far Rocky has come in his training.<br/><br/>The film is very slow paced, but that's perfect for developing Rocky's and the other characters' development in the film. The film startes slow, because we're slowly learning about Rocky and at the same time get very sympathetic for him as he get's a lot trash talk from people. But when we come to the ice skating scene, the film will get you invested in what will happened for the rest of the film. Here you know who Rocky is and what makes him so interesting and you get very attached to him from then on before we get to the main plot of the film.<br/><br/>The actors does a brilliant job. With no doubts, Rocky is Stallone's best performance. His expressions and lines are delivered perfectly and he's very convincing. Talia, Burt, Carl and Burgess and other actors also does a great job in their roles. It also helps by the excellent script which makes the lines convincing.<br/><br/>But if there's one problem, then that is the fact the slow pacing and the simple plot will make some turn down the film, and it's not really about boxing unlike the sequels.
And also while the fight choreography is good and very realistic, some punches comes off as awkward as for example, there's one scene where Rocky is supposed to get hit by the champ, but it doesn't look like it.<br/><br/>However, since the rest of the film is so good, I don't mind these problems. I love this film. It's actually one of my favorite films of all time. The pacing is perfect, the music, the script and the actors are all great. I don't know what else I can say about film right now, but I highly recommend this film: 10/10."

I saw a movie about opportunity, about being an unknown becoming known. There were parts I did not care for, like Paulie incessantly breaking Adrian down. Not called for, but people said it the character's drinking problem that caused his rants and rages. Fine. Yet the movie itself makes you want to cheer for the underdog by being right there ringside. From start to finish, it's an awesome movie with an awesome score with awesome acting.<br/><br/>Packs a mean upper cut. Very excellent movie indeed."

","Rocky is a movie that was made in 1976. The movie is about a man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is a debt collector and a boxer. In his boxing career, his nickname is the Italian Stallion. Rocky is very poor in the beginning of the movie because his boxing career isn't taking off. Soon, things start to look up for Rocky as he is chosen to take on the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed. Apollo uses Rocky to make himself look better, to make a ""nobody"" into a ""somebody."" Apollo uses Rocky for viewers. He knows he's going to win right off the bat, but Apollo doesn't realize that Rocky is taking the fight seriously. This can be his only shot at the big leagues. Therefore, Rocky acquires a trainer named Mickey Goldmill. Mickey is a feisty old man, who believes in Rocky, but knows Rocky has to put in a lot of work to win this fight. He tests and pushes Rocky to his limit. Rocky trains extremely hard for this match. Later in the movie, Rocky and Apollo have their boxing match. 
 At this time in the movie, Rocky is smitten with a woman named Adrian. Adrian and her brother Paulie are there to watch the fight. Apollo is taken by surprise when Rocky, The Italian Stallion, comes into the ring ready to fight. They fight until the fifteenth round. Apollo Creed had said he would knock Rocky out in the second round, but Rocky has just proved him wrong. The judges chose Apollo Creed as the winner, but it was a difficult decision. Apollo doesn't understand how Rocky was able to make it this far. Now, Rocky has his chance as a boxer. He starts to get in more professional boxing matches, and is now making a lot of money. Rocky continues to fight throughout the Rocky series, continuing to the movies II,III,IV, and, V.
 Overall, the first Rocky movie had received 93% in rotten tomatoes, and a high review score on other websites. I believe the Rocky movie was thrilling and heart-wrenching. Although, at times, Rocky is very difficult to understand. I love sitting down and watching this movie with my family. You feel like a part of this movie. The struggle Rocky endures, the preparation to the fight, the awesome soundtrack, and watching him make his way to the big leagues. You feel the adrenaline and hope Rocky does. The actors portray the characters accurately and immensely. They make you feel the struggle, the love, the hate, the hard work and dedication. Rocky is truly a fantastic movie. 
 Also, with the movie being made in the 1970s, the effects are great. The sound effects, noises, bruises, etc. It is a high quality movie for it being made over decades ago. The camera angles are fantastic, and the soundtrack is just amazing. It gives you that adrenaline feeling. It's a very high quality movie. It's one of my family favorites. 
 The number one thing I enjoy about this movie is the message. The message of the movie is you can do anything as long as you put your mind and dedicate yourself to it. Even if people doubt you, or thing you're a joke, you can always prove them wrong. You can start anywhere. You can do it. This is movie has such a strong, emotional message. You can prove the people who doubt you that they were and are wrong. It shows you may not have a lot of people in your corner, but you can still succeed. One of Rocky's problems were because he was getting older. New boxers were coming in, and they were better than Rocky. Rocky didn't let that stop him. It doesn't matter your age, your education, or if people doubt you. You can do whatever you set your mind too. Rocky does such a fantastic job portraying that message. This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's a classic, heart-warming, emotional movie. I highly recommend if anyone has not taken the time to sit down and watch this movie. You're missing out. It's great."

"stormhawk2020","9","0","0","4 September 2018"," One of the most underrated movies
","""Rocky"" is a very worthy movie that ends up moving thanks to a very well achieved climax and the great description of the characters. Sometimes I think that this movie has been devalued over time because the script is by Sylvester Stallone. It is true that his interpretation is not any wonder, but the script of this film is one of the best I've seen. With a beautiful love story between two shy characters and a not-so-high self-esteem of course, far from Hollywood's glamorous love relationships and the underlying theme of success and failure in life, we find ourselves with a very well built, it hurts whoever hurts.
If this is signed by another director and the script was signed by another person, the media of IMDb would shoot up like the foam, because I'm sick of having seen movies with scripts and very mediocre stories with averages superior to this excellent film, only endorsed by the name of the one who signed them. But in the end, all that matters, the really important thing is that we can always get excited again and again with the great performance of the fight between Apollo and the ""Italian Stallion"". Whatever they say, their three Oscars are well deserved, missing in my opinion, a deserved Oscar for best script for Sylvester Stallone and another for the best soundtrack.<br/><br/>Wonderful and exciting final climax with Apollo celebrating the background victory and Rocky looking for his beloved Adrian. Beautiful."

","What makes a great film? Engaging characters, immersive story line, brilliant editing, fantastic music, an experience you can revisit again and again. Rocky has all of this and more. <br/><br/>When it comes to performance I honestly do not know where Rocky starts and Sylvester Stallone ends. Stallone did not just play this character he conceived, created and crafted it. This is not method acting this goes way beyond that. <br/><br/>What is this film about? Loneliness, love, self-respect, poverty, heartache, shyness, chance, pride, friendship, boxing? It is about life! <br/><br/>Rocky is a downtrodden character, in the words of Mickey (Burgess Meredith) Rocky is a bum, a loser, he had talent but never applied it. Rocky does not see this, he lives his life, he has some boxing skills which he puts to use in the occasional low-key cash fights and working as a money collector for the local crime lord. Rocky has the physical attributes for the debt collecting job but deep down he has a soft heart. He is not the smartest guy but ultimately he is a good guy. <br/><br/>Rocky is friends with Paulie (Burt Young) who is a deeply flawed character. Unlike Rocky he has a chip on his shoulder at life and the cards he has been dealt. Paulie has a sister Adrian (Talia Shire) that has not had an easy life either. She is painfully shy and introverted. Adrian works at the local pet shop which Rocky visits often. Rocky tries to make conversation and get to know her. The courtship between Adrian and Rocky is awkward at times but has a reality and sweetness that is undeniable. Rocky and Adrian eventually date. <br/><br/>Rocky's life is on a nowhere trajectory until out the blue his name is selected by Apollo Creed (Carl weathers) the heavy weight champion of the world as a publicity stunt. Apollo Creed wants to stage a boxing event where a lowly ranked amateur boxer gets a chance to fight for the title, ""The American dream"". Initially stunned and unwilling to take on this challenge, Rocky does not feel he is worthy or capable of this. Mickey eventually persuades Rocky to take this once in a lifetime chance. And so begins the rest of the film. Cue training montage. <br/><br/>Rocky works on many levels, that is why bit is such a fantastic film. The characters have a human naivety and poignancy that resonates. The editing and music are sublime in parts. It is a film I will watch again and again and appreciate more each time."

","I could go on for ages about this movie and why I love it so much, but I'll try not to bore you and keep it relatively concise.<br/><br/>I first saw this film at the age of ten. I am aware that many children find this movie boring and prefer the more action-packed and exciting sequels. This was not my experience. I was instantly enthralled by Sylvester Stallone's lovable character. This truly is his movie and he does a wonderful job with it. He wrote a beautifully realistic script with characters that you truly feel for. In addition, his performance in the title role makes the audience instantly empathize with him through scenes such as the one where he refuses to break a man's thumbs for the loan shark he works for. You're constantly rooting for the Italian Stallion.<br/><br/>The other characters are also great. Talia Shire's performance as Adrian is wonderfully shy and reserved. The relationship between herself and our protagonist is the heart of the narrative, and the two actors' chemistry is undeniable.<br/><br/>Adrian's brother, Paulie, played by Burt Young, is another great character. He shows what someone like Rocky can turn into without a great deal of optimism and determination. Young's performance works especially well as he entices you into caring about him and liking him even when he is being rather unlikeable.<br/><br/>Rocky's trainer, Mickey Goldmill, played by Burgess Meredith, is hillariously cranky and sarcastic. At the same time, however, he never lets you forget that he really does care about Rocky and wants the best for him. This father-son sort of relationship is an integral component throughout the series.<br/><br/>The final main character is Apollo Creed, Rocky's opponent played by Carl Weathers. Weathers plays Creed as a celebrity as much as a boxer. He's a showman in the vein of fighters like Muhammad Ali. His charisma is what draws you to him and prevents him from being a supervillain.<br/><br/>I mention the characters individually because they are what draws you into this movie's universe. You see them as people and you want to see them happy. This is an accomplishment not only of Sylvester Stallone, but of the performers who brought his script to vivid life.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie not only presents an interesting story which you want to see through to its conclusion, it also represents the best of what a film can do. It can turn characters into real human beings and use them to tell a story that is nothing but just that: human."

Rocky's character arc is so familiar that everyone, even who don't watch many movies, knows every single detail about it. But the movie adds a simple twist, yet a very effective one, in the character's motivations.<br/><br/>But it didn't stop here, as the movie keeps raising the stakes by making an advantage of all the developments that have been given to all the characters.<br/><br/>The movie could have easily used the ups and downs of Rocky to evoke our feelings. Instead, the movie succeeded to be very moving by taking advantage of the very new twist that has been added to Balboa's motivations. The result is an underdog heroic character that is by no means clichéd. And Stallone shines in this movie and gave his best performance in his career. There are some moments when Rocky's confidence has been shaken a little bit and the hero starts to tell the message of the story and these moments somewhat worked, and they could have never worked without Sylvester Stallone's superb acting.<br/><br/>I said that Rocky takes advantage of the developments of all its characters. Yes, all its characters!<br/><br/>The character of Adrian, for instance, has some realistic and genuine details that make the romance between her and Rocky works very well, although the relationship proceeds so fast. Talia Shire performance made Adrian even more realistic,unique and very compelling character.<br/><br/>Paulie is another great character that made the movie even more poignant as it gave some depth for Rocky too.<br/><br/>What I didn't like so much is Apollo Creed. In contrast to the rest of the characters, he is nothing but the stereotypical undefeated Champion. Also, all decisions he made exposed the movie's clichéd story. With that being said, his scenes are masterfully directed and he has a very catchy style. <br/><br/>The final fight scene is maybe the most realistic fight scene has been shot at that time. And those who think it's not, please watch a boxing match and you'll find that boxing punches make sounds different from the comic book punches sounds that are still used in movies today.<br/><br/>(9/10)"

","I saw this film again recently, maybe for the first time in forty years, since it was released back in the seventies, and was happy to see that it has lost none of its power. Stallone's performance shocked me because I had come to think of him early on as a ham bone, an actor of little talent who would spend his career playing thugs, and street toughs, and bad guys like Machine gun Joe Viterbo. And then, out of nowhere, comes this masterpiece, and the role of a lifetime. How wrong I was, how wrong we all were, about him. The film, written by Stallone, is a metaphor for his own career, and the fear of being typecast, and relegated to walk ons and minor roles He proved in the most impressive way that he wasn't ""just another bum from the neighborhood"", but one of the most talented guys on the block. Stallone put himself into this film body and soul, and the power of his performance is something to see. The supporting cast, especially Burgess Meredith in one of his best roles, are all excellent. A must see film, and a true classic that has stood the test of time. A Cinderella story in which art imitates life."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","23 December 2017"," The underdog story
","A breakthrough in Sylvester Stallone's career and still a role he's most known for, after all these years. A tale of a Philadelphia man down on his luck. He's doing odd jobs, mostly collecting money, trying to get a girlfriend. In his spare time he boxes, but even that is going only so so. Until the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), offers him a shot at the title, as something of a curiosity event.<br/><br/>This movie and the whole franchise that followed are known as the boxing films. ""Have you seen the boxing films?"" ""You mean the Rocky films?"" ""Yeah, those."" As such it can be something of a surprise to learn that these films, at least the first two, are really not about boxing. Sure, it's the background for the plot and the climax is the match. But it's really about an underdog. About being poor, with no prospects, no future. About being given that single impossible chance at something different. And that's universal, that's all-encompassing.<br/><br/>And as just a movie it's also quite lovely. Done with a small budget, with a relatively untested and unknown lead actor, who also happened to write the script. And we also know nowadays that Stallone isn't exactly known for his acting capabilities. Except in these films. In here he's a man speaking from his heart, speaking for an entire generation, an entire class of people.<br/><br/>And sure, the film isn't perfect. It's not the most well-shot film there is, the fight choreographies are not what they would eventually end up being and the way Rocky eventually wins over Adrian (Talia Shire) is pretty cringe-worthy to a modern viewer. The film was made in the 70s, let's leave it at that.<br/><br/>But, sometimes a story is so good, the characters so iconic, raw and real, the whole experience so strangely life-representing, that all these minor flaws melt away. Rocky is a classic, no doubt about it."

","He has his childhood picture shoved aside at the corner of his mirror. His pet fish is just so tiny, and yet he named it ""Moby Dick"". His best friend and his sister struggle not to feel so defeated in life. His coach has been striving to train his own champion for the past 50 years, and this is all happening at the heart of Philadelphia, a city that used to be the shining capital of the nation, now mostly portrayed almost like a slum-like area throughout the film. They are all losers so real to the minute details and yet, are all so likable. <br/><br/>A low budget matching the producers' expectations, and by-then unknown actor and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone, eventually surprised the world with this single film. I doubt there can be a more defining underdog story both in and out of the film. Not to mention the music, montage, and Steadicam scenes that will go down in film history.<br/><br/>Films that are so iconic that they define a particular genre, are often seen riddled with tropes and clichés in a later point of view. In Rocky's case, however, it was pleasant to find that even the ending was truly satisfying. <br/><br/>""'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance. Nobody's ever gone the distance with Creed, and if I can go that distance, you see, and that bell rings and I'm still standin', I'm gonna know for the first time in my life, see, that I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood.""<br/><br/>He wasn't even listening to the referee's call."

Don't think that because I'm a woman that Rocky is anywhere near a chick flick, but it's not a jock boxing movie either. This movie is personal to me because I've walked the streets it's filmed on. I've lived the struggle of Philly life. This movie touches my soul and makes me proud every time I watch it.<br/><br/>Rocky is a down on his luck 2nd rate boxer who gets a once in a lifetime chance to fight for the heavyweight title. The movie isn't about winning or losing. Its about what someone can do given a chance. It's about rising to the challenge, going the distance and being proud of yourself in the end. Rocky is more than just a movie in Philadelphia. It's a mantra. A badge of honor. And something we brag about like one of our kids. Rocky, to a Philly native, is just as much the story of the quality of the citizens of Philadelphia as it is about this one man's struggle. We identify with him. We root for him. And we feel like his journey is our own. Any movie that can lift up an entire city is certainly worth watching.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, the music is both iconic and uplifting and the scenery is authentic. If you want to be inspired, engaged and excited, then watch Rocky. It won't let you down."

","Who would have thought that a goofy bum from Philly would become one of the most beloved film characters? The story of Rocky Balboa inspired millions of people around the world and continues to have a massive impact till this day. Containing everything a great movie needs, it was able to win best picture at the Oscars in 1976. From its memorable characters to the heart pumping score, Rocky remains to be one of the most influential and iconic films of all time.<br/><br/>No one would want to watch a movie with boring or unrelatable. As they are one of the biggest factors of a movie, characters should create feeling and emotion within the viewer. Fortunately for everybody, that's exactly what the cast of Rocky did. Rocky himself had a kind of insignificant feel to him. He was a silly illiterate bum working for a loan shark.It was easy to relate to him for many people since he wasn't living in a mansion or have super powers. Despite all of the seemingly negative facts about his life, Rocky quickly becomes a lovable and amazing character. His odd sense of humor plays a large role in making him a fan favorite. There is one scene in which he is talking to a little girl who was smoking and drinking. Rocky tries offering some advice and says, ""You hang out with nice people, you get nice friends, ya understand? You hang out with smart people, you get smart friends. You hang out with yo-yo's you get yo-yo friends. You see, simple mathematics''. Combined with Sylvester Stallone's odd and distinct accent, this quote is one of my favorites as it displays Rocky's bizarre mindset and humor. Along with Rocky, there are multiple characters that mold right into the story and become relatable in their own way. Paulie (Burt Young) is a no good alcoholic bum. He gets in bar fights and occasionally threatens his sister in his drunken rage. Everyone knows a Paulie in their life; that guy that you know you probably shouldn't be hanging around, but you also know that he's always got your back. Adrian (Talia Shire) is a shy and quiet woman. She appears weak in many ways, however she loves and supports Rocky through all circumstances. Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is the old timer, the potty mouth old school trainer who pushes Rocky to his limit to unlock his full potential. Finally we have Apollo (Carl Weathers). The raining heavyweight champ. He has a big personality and an even bigger mouth. As a polar opposite to Rocky, he makes an interesting opponent. With all these characters, Rocky captivates it's audience and creates an unbreakable bond between those on screen and those watching.<br/><br/>To add onto the brilliant character design, the score from Rocky is nothing short of iconic. There isn't a man over the age of forty that doesn't have a song from Rocky on his workout playlist. The main theme has become a workout music staple, and will get your blood pumping no matter what time of day. The trumpets hit you like a brick wall, and you instantly feel like you could jump over a building or knock someone out. Along with its theme, songs such as ""Eye of the Tiger"" have become immortalized in pop culture. The intensity and drive of each track in the soundtrack of Rocky will motivate, encourage, and pump up its listeners at any time of day. Among many famous themes, Rocky will remain the most recognizable for decades to come.<br/><br/>There are thousands of movies out there. Each has its own unique story and feel. However there are a couple movies out there that stand out above the rest. Rocky is one of those movies. What makes the Rocky saga so brilliant is its combination of unique characters, and iconic score. There will never be another, and the legacy will live on forever."

Rocky will show you that anything is possible and dreams can be achieved no matter what. The film begins with Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) fighting and winning a match at a private boxing club. After the fight and throughout the film, you will follow Rocky through the streets of Philadelphia, getting to know his lovable and humble character.<br/><br/>Because Rocky cannot make a living with boxing, he has to find other ways to make money, which he does by collecting money for a loan shark. During his many walks, he makes frequent stops in a pet store to see Adrian (Talia Shire), a very shy woman who he eventually dates. Adrian begins to like Rocky and becomes a strong supporter for him. Rocky has a complicated relationship with boxing trainer, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith). Mickey tells Rocky he needs to consider retirement, adding to the obstacles of success Rocky already feels he has in front of him. An opportunity arises as the current heavyweight champion Apollo Creed's (Carl Weathers) opponent for a New Year's Day match can no longer fight and he is looking for an opponent from the city of Philadelphia. After consideration, Rocky accepts the opportunity and Mickey trains him.<br/><br/>Director, John Avildsen, uses great lighting and camera angles to make you feel like you are in the midst of city of Philadelphia. As Rocky is out and about the city, Avildsen using darker lighting to portray Rocky living in a poor area and not having much money or possessions. The streets are usually unpopulated with cars and often have people loitering outside. Throughout the film, long shot camera angles are taken of Rocky making you feel like he is fighting the world alone. It is best shown when Rocky is running the day before the fight and runs to the top of the Philadelphia Art Museum steps with his arms up and ""Gonna Fly Now"" playing in the background.<br/><br/>When the fight begins the next night, take-in the artistic work of Avildsen and Stallone. Avildsen use of sound and camera angles has you feeling like you are setting ringside. Stallone has written the first of seven memorable Rocky movies, but this one will always be the classic. It is a ""must see"" and in the end, you will find yourself in the middle of the ""City of Brotherly Love"" rooting for the underdog, the Italian Stallion."

","First, i don't speak English very well. About the movie, that's the best sports movie i ever seen. The history is about overcoming and simplicity. All six movies are awesome. The historic context shows the cold war influence. I see this movie more than ten times. Stallone is a genially movie's writer, but the best character is Paulie, the drunk Adrian's brother. Is really good time, the two hours spends for see Rocky. MMA never shine like the golden box years. The final of this movie is unpredictable and perfect. The most incredible of the whole plot is the ability to create a thought- provoking plot without a villain. Apollo Creed, in no instance would fit into this concept. On the contrary, despite being a marketer, he believed in the concept of nation of opportunities. He is the reason that Rocky got an opportunity and took a swing at the fate of a failed amateur sportsman"

","Rocky is the story of man who capitalizes on the opportunity of a lifetime. Sylvester Stallone stars as local Philadelphia club fighter Rocky Balboa. Rocky is in a rut and is seemingly wasting his talent with a lackluster work ethic and no drive to get beyond fighting the nobodies. By day he makes a living collecting money for a local thug but deep down inside Rocky isn't a crook. He doesn't have the stomach or mean streak to hurt people down on their luck. Unbeknownst to him, his life was about to change forever. The heavyweight boxing champ Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers had a scheduled boxing match in Philadelphia which was canceled last minute. In an unlikely turn of events, Creed decided to give a hometown fighter a date with the champ. As fate would have it Rocky was picked based solely on his name. Rocky knew this was his shot to finally change his lot in life and be somebody. He enlists the help of Paulie (Burt Young) and Mickey (Burgess Meredith) to perform as his manager and trainer/corner crew. As the fight approaches Rocky starts to realize he may actually have a shot at going 15 rounds with Creed which was never done before. He admits to his love interest Adriana (Talia Shire) he has no real shot at victory but simply wants to finish all 15 rounds. When the day of the big bout finally arrived it surely didn't disappoint! Rocky shocked Apollo Creed with a surprise 1st round knockdown which made Creed realize this fight wasn't going to end easily. The two fighters would spend the next 15 rounds exchanging vicious blows resulting in one of the all-time greatest cinematic displays of boxing. Apollo Creed would eventually be named the winner by decision but Rocky will always be viewed as a champion for the heart he displayed that night. This film will forever give the little guy who is down on his luck a little hope. Rocky proves that anyone with guts and determination can overcome the odds and defy all expectations. I believe this movie will forever be remembered by numerous iconic scenes but the two that have always stuck out to me are of Rocky punching the carcass on television and of him running through the neighborhood and gaining an entourage as he goes. Punching the carcass in a way gave Rocky an edge to him that Apollo didn't seem to have anymore. It showed Rocky was hungry and was literally starting from the bottom. The scene with Rocky running through the neighborhood made us all jump into his corner as the neighborhood showed an unwavering support to their guy. This culminated in one of the most recognized movie scenes and music scores as Rocky reached the top of the museum steps and imagined himself being the champ. With the music in the background and the breath taking camera angle it made us all believe in Rocky. I have always appreciated a good sports flick, but this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. This is a fantastic story of the classic underdog who must fight for everything he desires from being a respected fighter to gaining the love of Adriana. Rocky will make you believe that with a fighter chance anything is possible."

","Great movie to begin a wonderful series. The actresses and actors are superb. From my understanding this was a very low budget film but the movie is a superstar from the beginning to end. It is a movie of an underdog fighting to make something of himself. It is about the triumph of the human spirit and can be uplifting to all viewers. From directing to producing, editing and definitely acting is first rate. I am not a sports movie fan and I guess boxing is considered a sport but I am a huge fan of all five movies.

","May 8, 2016<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone stars as a determined underdog who wants to make something of himself. His name is ""Rocky"" and he's going to win no matter what and take Adrian with him. John G. Avildsen directs this masterpiece about not giving up in life and pushing past all the boundaries that life throws at you.<br/><br/>It's about an uneducated, hard-living prize boxer, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) who is from an Italian neighborhood in Philadelphia and pushing 30 years old with nothing to show for it. When he is not fighting he works as an enforcer for a loan shark, Anthony Guzzo (Joe Spinell ). Rocky is looked at as a bum even though he is kind-hearted, has a real determination to go the distance and desires to profess his love to a local pet store clerk, Adrian (Talia Shire). When World Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) finds himself in a jam, he chooses to give Rocky a shot at the championship on New Year's Eve. Together with Adrienne and his trainer, Mickey (Burgess Meredith), Rocky prepares for the fight he has been waiting for.<br/><br/>I was really surprised at how detailed this film is. Philadelphia looks like a slum-like town and deserted with brick buildings on every corner. Rocky walks the streets at night to people standing around burning garbage cans. He stops in to see Adrian at the pet store in the morning and every night in a kind-hearted attempt to talk to her. Adrian is one of the sweetest characters in this picture. She is extremely introverted and Rocky is desperately in love with her. She knows he means well but has never trusted anyone before, especially a prize fighter. She listens to Rocky's painfully awkward conversations and jokes. He knows he can get Adrian's attention and desperately tries. One of the sweetest scenes in the film is when Rocky takes Adrian out at the local Ice arena and tries to show her a good time on Thanksgiving.<br/><br/>When Rocky is not working, he is working out at Mickey's Gym. Mickey is a retired fighter who always beats Rocky down for never reaching his full potential. Rocky drinks and smokes and wastes his talent away on local prize fighters that would never give Rocky the chance to live up to his name the ""Italian Stallion."" Mickey has a change of heart when he sees the opportunity for Rocky to succeed and decides to take Rocky under his wing. He makes him get up early in the morning, drinks raw eggs and runs. There is a scene where Rocky runs up the steps of Philadelphia's art museum, jumps in the air, and he knows he is ready to go the distance.<br/><br/>Apollo Creed is an interesting character that kind of resembles Muhammad Ali. He is smart but also self-centered due to his status as a champ. The kind of guy that believes he is unbeatable. I suppose there is always one but Apollo doesn't come off as a fast talker. He is a player and he knows the game but doesn't look at the options. He sees Rocky as an underdog and that the underdog is always easy to beat. He chooses Rocky because of his name and sees it as a racial contrast for America: A black man vs. an Italian man. He appears in the ring dressed as Uncle Sam. How Patriotic! <br/><br/>What makes this picture so special is that it pulls us in emotionally and has a true heart that I think everyone can relate to. ""The underdog in all of us."" ""Going the distance and reaching your potential."" Rocky's love for Adrian steals the show and his determination holds true to the film's story. It doesn't surprise us with any twist ending or anything special within the story. It doesn't unfold to be confusing. These are characters that we can believe are real because they are well written and give the story the strength it needs to be interesting.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone wrote this picture with him in mind to play the role and I couldn't think of another actor to play him because he takes the role to heart as the underdog/loser who steps up when opportunity knocks. Talia Shire is adorable as Adrian. I have never seen a character written as sweet as she is and she is played to wonders. Both characters are played to critical acclaim. Burt Young plays Adrian's alcoholic brother, Paulie, who works in a meat packing plant, is bitter and abusive that leads Adrian to ask Rocky the question: <br/><br/>""Do you want a roommate?"" - Adrian <br/><br/>""Absolutely,"" - Rocky <br/><br/>This is next step in their relationship in the carefully written script. These are the moments to remember in the picture because even the underdog gets the girl in the end. Rocky sticks by her and knows he can make it with her by his side. By the end of the film, we know who the winner is going to be, however, the fight is incredible to see. It's so heartbreaking that by the end of it, you know that ""Rocky II"" is going to be made. Now can it live up the masterpiece that this film is? I think so. These are characters that must be explored more and it would be a shame if this was it."
"luke-a-mcgowan","10","0","0","5 December 2015"," Stallone's masterpiece
","They say there are only seven stories in existence, and every movie therefore must fit one of those stories. I'd argue that Rocky defined a story in its own right, because many sports (and many non-sports) movies since have followed its formula. With the possible exception of The Godfather, I doubt so many movies have been spawned by a winning formula. But Rocky is the original and by far the best, set aside by Sylvester Stallone's winning performance and John Avildsen's direction.<br/><br/>For many reasons, Stallone will always be intricately linked with Rocky Balboa, but the reason I consider the most important is because his rise in Hollywood is synonymous with Rocky's own. He was a street tough with a dream (Hollywood career/boxing career) but resorted to less than glamorous work (porn/breaking thumbs for loan sharks). He absolutely lives the role of Rocky - he's charming, a bit thuggish and he absolutely wears his heart on his sleeve. You couldn't teach the best actors alive to replicate Stallone's shyness or awkward touching the wall when he tries to flirt with Adrian. When rejected by others, you can see the hurt written plainly across his face. Rocky is so afraid of rejection, he asks out Adrian and then never gives her a chance to say no because he nervously fills the silence with rambling.<br/><br/>Rocky's relationship with Adrian (Tahlia Shire, who is more incredible than she ever was in The Godfather series) is one of my favourite put to film. Both are so shy but show it in very different ways. They have a connection but it takes her a third of a movie to even have a conversation with him. Watching their romance blossom throughout Rocky is almost more rewarding than watching him go toe-to-toe with Creed in the ring. When the credits rolled, I felt like I'd made two new friends - that is how invested I was in their romance. Burgess Meredith and Burt Young both crop up as supporting players in Rocky's life, and both deliver solid performances. The film belongs absolutely to Stallone and Shire, and we miss them when they're not on screen.<br/><br/>Rather than creating a villainous braggart like the opponents in Southpaw and even Million Dollar Baby, Stallone pens an opponent whose adversity comes from his stark contrast to Rocky himself. Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed is exceptionally articulate and reeking of confidence, the two areas that are Rocky's greatest weaknesses. Combine that with the huge scale of the fight and we as an audience can be severely intimidated by the ordeal Rocky is about to undertake. We feel Rocky's tearful apprehension the night before, and watching Rocky knock Creed down makes us want to cheer in triumph.<br/><br/>Avildsen's direction is assured and he does a masterful job guiding our emotions throughout the film. The film's glorious music builds in triumphant excitement as Rocky's fitness increases - quiet piano as he gasps and pants his way up the stairs through to brazen trumpets as he bounds effortlessly up in the film's most iconic scene. He keys sad music whenever the moment calls for it - most notably a beautiful scene where Rocky is yelled at for just trying to help out a little girl. Its always hard to decide when to give credit to Stallone's screenplay or to Avildsen's direction, so I'll just praise them both. Each character is so well written and all of the dialogue feels completely natural. People say Rocky should be enjoyed without looking at it too much, but I disagree - I think Rocky is deeper and more thoughtful than many give it credit.<br/><br/>A deserving Best Picture winner, Rocky embodies exactly what the Academy should recognise: culturally significant movies that explode and change cinema forever."

Although some would argue it's not the best one and there's there choice but I always find that usually the first in a line of films can't be topped. Sly does a grand job as you Burt Young you have probably seen before plays a good role as Adrian's brother but Adrian herself AKA Talia Shire steals the show with her shy retiring ways, that Rocky has to try and bring her out of, though a little hard with her protective brother watching her every move, So if you have not seen it, where have you been?

","Even with a plot attached to boxing, what makes Rocky stand out is not strictly focus on the fights, but also develop a dramatic side, thereby allowing the characters to be built. Especially the relationship between Rocky and Adrian played by Talia Shire, that gave a more sentimental and emotional tone to the film. Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa is spectacular, a common person, by many considered an underdog, who has received an unique opportunity. By taking it, see the chance of stop being a failure, as he wants to feel relevant and become someone in life. Another interesting idea was putting different views and intentions regarding the fight between the fighters. The story is very inspirational and with a striking soundtrack, left as a legacy, several iconic scenes, such as the training scene where is playing ""Gonna fly now"" and has a beautiful sequence of shots with the city of Philadelphia in the background."

","Its critics often dismiss Rocky as a fairytale, but like many fairy tales, it's often dark and unpleasant before we get to happily ever after (and let us not forget, Rocky loses). What it isn't is cynical. Or at least not as relentlessly so as many of its contemporaries.<br/><br/>The performances here are outstanding. I can't think of another movie where the main cast so inhabit their characters, and like the movie, there's a much deeper undercurrent to these deceptively simple archetypes. Rocky is no Pollyanna. He copes with his dreary reality by meeting it with good humor, but there are a few scenes where Stallone lets us see the frustration and bitterness simmering beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Unlike many of its sequels, which focused on boxing first, here the focus is on people. Particularly the love story between Rocky and Adrian. Stallone and Shire have wonderful chemistry together, and ultimately we want to see these two somewhat broken people come together. Long before Tom Cruise's ""You complete me."" in Jerry Maguire, Rocky Balboa and Adrian ""filled gaps"". As he told Paulie ""She's got gaps, I've got gaps. Together, we fill gaps."".<br/><br/>The boxing action here isn't as thrilling as its sequels (though it's inarguably more realistic), but what it lacks in flash it more than makes up for in drama. There's a scene in the 14th round where Apollo Creed (played with consummate charm by Carl Weathers) has knocked down Rocky for what he thinks (and clearly hopes) is the final time. Bloody and beaten himself, Apollo looks more relieved than elated. But then Rocky, against the pleas of his manager Mickey (the incomparable Burgess Meredith), slowly gets to his feet as Apollo looks on in disbelief. Those kinds of moments, ones focused on real human drama, are ultimately far more powerful and inspiring than slick montages set to catchy rock songs... not that I don't love those too."
"ivo-cobra8","10","0","0","3 November 2015"," A classic! the best and the original movie of all time - Rocky !
","Rocky (1976) It is still today one of the best action, sport, drama and a cult classic low budget films ever made in history. It is an underdog story telling about a men and his struggle in his life. Sure, I know that without it, there'd be no sequels for a ranking, but compared to III, although this Best Picture of 1976 was great, it just dragged a bit for me. I'm no brainless action-goer, mind you. I love real human drama portrayed on screen. I've got to say though, at times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. This to me is a no brainier. You get introduced to an insecure Rocky who works for the mob as a collector, but has too big of a heart to go around hurting people in an awesome heartfelt movie. Adrian and Rock meet, You get introduced to the lovable A-hole Pauly. Introduced to Creed. Introduced to Mick. and BUTKUS! And Rock goes the distance with Creed! This movie has a Heart . As a kid Rocky III was my favorite best movie ,but this one is my second best movie. YO ADRIAN I DID IT!!! <br/><br/>It is my first best favorite film in the series and I just love this film to death. It has a message and it is portraying a real human drama. Rocky is a movie that everyone can relate to. One of my favorite Stallone roles, there is nobody else who could play Rocky better than him, it's too bad that he didn't win Oscar because i honestly think that he deserved it. But at least movie won the best picture of the year award. Maybe Rocky didn't win the fight in the movie, but Stallone did win his ""fight"" in real life. Rocky, a poor guy that just barley manages to get by, just wants to fight. However, everyone including his trainer has given up on him. Rocky also wants to go on a date with Adrian, a very shy girl who works at the local pet store, Adrian, however, is too shy to even say anything to anyone. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (the heavy-weight champion of boxing) learns that his boxing partner has been injured and can't fight. Apollo tries all the other potential boxing partners, but every one of them refuse. Apollo decides to give an unknown boxer a chance to fight him for the title, with the intentions of just giving him five minutes of fame then knocking him out. Apollo picks Rocky. This is the Rocky's only shot at the big time and chance he will never get it back.<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa is a struggling boxer trying to make the big time, working as a debt collector for a pittance. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed visits Philadelphia, his managers want to set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, touting the fight as a chance for a ""nobody"" to become a ""somebody"". The match is supposed to be easily won by Creed, but someone forgot to tell Rocky, who sees this as his only shot at the big time. Sylvester Stallone, himself a virtual unknown, managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis, the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone, this was a make-or-break opportunity — just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars, Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere, earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture.<br/><br/>The original Rocky film is one of the greatest epic action sport drama film in the history! It contains action, humor, romance, and an uplifting message. The screenplay is great, and features some truly touching moments. There is also some great camera work, thanks to the new Steadicam. It's a shame Stallone's later career and all the Rocky sequels have lessened this film in the eyes of many. This film is truly a classic and deserves to be seen at least once by everyone.<br/><br/>Rocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G.

","Rocky has been on of my families favorites for forty years now, and it still speaks to the modern viewer in a way that is as powerful as it was in 1976. <br/><br/>I feel a good many of us can relate to the character of Rocky Balboa who is a Boxer in the Kensington section of Philadelphia. A guy who is frustrated in his life by his lack of good fortune in having his dreams come true. A once in a lifetime opportunity from Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed puts them toe to toe in the ring for Rocky to have a shot at the title.<br/><br/>I feel Stallone was telling us a very personal story through the guise of Rocky, and it mirrors how his own acting career was going at the time. Any of us who had to struggle for the things in our lives can appreciate the themes of this movie. <br/><br/>The cinematography makes the movie feel almost documentary like sometimes, and it captures the gritty existence of Philadelphia's ghettos. The scenes at night can get pretty dark looking at times, but it helps to give the movie the atmosphere of depression that exists in Rocky's life. <br/><br/>Also, I must mention there isn't much music to speak of, the only one you will really notice is the unforgettable ""Gonna fly now"" by the talented Bill Conti.<br/><br/>All in all, if you are looking for pure escapism, or a movie to make you feel motivated or to lift you up, then you would be well nourished by watching this movie."

","I love this movie. Sylvester Stallone had a specific idea of who he wanted Rocky to be, and he played it to perfection. The dialogue is refreshingly original, witty, and charming. The creativity in the story and the characters is evident from the first moment you see Rocky talk to himself in the mirror. The low budget nature of the film only accents the authentic performance of Stallone, while Talia Shire and Burt Young tackle their roles with grace and believable sibling chemistry. <br/><br/>If you are looking for an uplifting look at the American Dream without those awful clichés this franchise has become synonymous with, this is the movie for you."
"alindsay-al","9","0","0","16 September 2015"," A fantastic film that is truly groundbreaking
","In preparation of the upcoming rocky spin off creed I have decided to review the previous rocky movies, so to start with the first film. The premise of this film sees a down on his luck boxer who gets a chance to fight the world champion as the true underdog. Now when I think of Sylvester Stallone I think of the character rocky balboa. He is phenomenal in this film, you see the emotion from his character and he is just so likable that you want to truly get behind him and you really believe in rocky balboa. There is everything you need in this film character wise, a good romantic interest Who has great chemistry with Stallone. There is also a great trainer and manager who really add to the film. The story of this film is so relatable to anybody because it is a complete underdog story. Everything works with this story, its simple but so effective in its execution. The script is alright with some funny and good dramatic dialogue that really works. However, sometimes it doesn't work and it makes the characters a bit less impressive. The style is fantastic, the training montage scene is incredible and one if the most iconic scenes in all of film. The boxing matches really work too and really helps. Overall this was a fantastic groundbreaking film that if your a fan of boxing films must be seen."

","Rocky is not perfect. I will not try to convey that it is. But just like the character Rocky, the movie more than makes up for its shortcomings with true, honest heart. As strange at is seems, the parts of this film that resonate the strongest with an audience happen outside of the boxing ring. While this is a sports movie, the characters drive this movie, not so much the action (which honestly didn't age as well as Sly). I think that comes down to Sylvester's script, which captures the true voice of real people. Rocky may not speak eloquently but the message is delivered in such a natural way that it is easy to let one's guard down and suspend disbelief, allowing the viewer to fall in love with these characters and their heart. Mr. Stallone had to fight tooth and nail to bring this story to life as he saw it, wage an uphill battle of seemingly impossible odds that only a crazed man loyal to his passion would be willing to endure. And this comes through for his titular character as well. When that much earnest drive is poured into the characters, the film simply cannot help but benefit. Overall, I highly recommend this film. Watch the way the characters interact, listen to the way they talk. They are living, breathing, fighting and loving humans; Therein lies the magic of ""Rocky""."

","It's easy to dismiss Rocky as a film and not having seen it for years I had. Watching it again recently though has re-opened my eyes to just how good a film it is. <br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is great as the struggling bum boxer given an unexpected shot at the world heavyweight title. Rocky is much more than a straight boxing movie however and the burgeoning romance between Rocky and Adrian ( a wonderful performance from Talia Shore) is dealt with brilliantly. <br/><br/>There is fine support from Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer and Burt Young as Adrians brother. <br/><br/>The actual boxing bout is highly unbelievable yet I was that engrossed it didn't really matter. It all ends a little unexpectedly but this is another strength of the film. <br/><br/>This is a film that can still be enjoyed by todays modern audience and this is a testimony to it's fine script.

"w-grayson","10","0","0","24 January 2015"," A story so much more than just boxing
","Rocky is an excellent film which is personally one of my all time favourites. From a very early age Rocky has been a film which has inspired me and I have watched again and again, however the older I get, the more the story becomes clear on a much more deeper level and as a result it is a film that gets better each time I watch it.<br/><br/>This is the film which launched Sylvester Stallone's acting career and Stallone himself was referred to as the 'next Marlon Brando' by the late great leading critic Roger Ebert. It is without doubt Stallone's best film to date.<br/><br/>Stallone plays the role of the average boxer, a boxer who lives off a salary which depends whether or not he is successful in the ring. Everyday for Rocky (Stallone) is just the same as the last and you get the growing feeling he has very little in his life worth living for. <br/><br/>Although Rocky is an average skilled fighter he has a big heart and a strong desire to achieve his ambitions of being much more than 'another bum from the neighbourhood'. He lives his life with few pleasures and few companions. His one true love is Adrian (Talia Shire) who is very much like Rocky. The chemistry between the two shown throughout the film is warming and quite beautiful to watch. Two individuals who need each other in order for happiness and triumph to succeed.<br/><br/>When Rocky is offered the biggest challenge of his life, it gives Rocky the opportunity to achieve his dream and prove he is not a 'nobody'.<br/><br/>Fundamentally though, the score provided by Bill Conti is a work of art and for many, it will stick in your mind-set for a long time when you hear the iconic music bellow through your TV. Conti captures the essence of the particular scenes within the movie and provides us with a wonderful soundtrack for us to enjoy. <br/><br/>Of course, many believe that this movie is a boxing movie and to be fair many of the other Rocky movies will support that. However the original Rocky shows so much more. It is an insight into the American Dream and that anything is possible if belief and courage is there in a human being. The movie shows how a nobody can become a somebody. Stallone portrays the character of Rocky very well along with stunning performances from Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed), Burgess Meredith (Mickey) and Burt Young (Paulie). <br/><br/>I hope you will enjoy this masterpiece of a movie."

","Before Rocky, there was very few movies about sports. After Rocky, movies about sports were coming like crazy. If there was no Rocky, there would be no Raging Bull, Rudy, Jerry Maguire, etc.<br/><br/>Rocky isn't all about sport. It is mostly a Cinderella story for men. It deal with chasing your dreams and not giving up. Sugar-coat that with boxing, and both sexes will definitely be satisfied. Since it is a Cinderella story undertaken in such an original and truly inspiring and intelligent way, it is only natural for this to become one of the best movies ever made.<br/><br/>I think everybody knows the general story of Rocky: an uneducated club-fighter from Philadelphia named Rocky Balboa (Stallone) who makes a living collecting money for a loan shark mobster (Spinnell) is hand-picked by world champion Apollo Creed (Weathers) because of his nick-name (""The Italian Stallion"") to be his opponent as a publicity gimmick. Rocky isn't sure if he can win, but he makes an effort and trains his hardest to go the distance. <br/><br/>Like most actors, Stallone was a poor upstart who came up with the idea of Rocky in his tiny apartment. It was so good that many production companies wanted to buy it from him, but Stallone refused. He got John G. Alvidson to direct, got the right stars, and Rocky was born. He knew it would be a sleeper hit. I'm sure he knew it would win Best Picture for 1976. <br/><br/>Rocky was a major success that spawned a total of five sequels. Some better than others, but all of which I loved. Soon after Rocky, Stallone's massive physique got him into mindless and mediocre action movies like Cobra and Tango & Cash. If I'm not mistaken, Stallone has won (or has been nominated for) more Golden Raspberry Awards than anybody in history. Only Adam Sandler has rivalled him in more embarrassing victories. I understand why Stallone has won all these bad awards, but he actually is a good actor. Just look at him in the first Rocky movie alone: he could have won an Oscar. All of Rocky was his creation--one of film's greatest."

Rocky is given a one-shot opportunity for the world title by the champion himself Apollo Creed. Now with a chance of a life time, Rocky needs help from former boxer and trainer Mickey and the support of his girlfriend Adrian to rise up to the challenge and take the guts and glory.

","People are often times licking their chops over gritty fight movies with a classic underdog story. There is just something about a David vs. Goliath feeling. Rocky includes this concept, with some added flavor. Sylvester Stallone, an actor/screenwriter, meshed together many incredible variables that makes this film more than meets the eye. It's an American dream, a love story and triumphant drama that is crafted into a motivational masterpiece. The plot is well done and entertaining to follow, the acting and characterization is impressively performed and the originality of the film gave Rocky a twist that brought all these components together for one legendary movie. <br/><br/>The legend begins with Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), a club boxer who is essentially putting his life on the line every day just to make forty dollars a victory. When it seems as though Rocky is set up to never succeed, he soon has everything going for him. The ""Italian Stallion"" randomly gets chosen by his soon to be opponent, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), to fight in an exhibition match advertising America as the ""Land of Opportunity"". This puts a spark in the life of Balboa that sends him on a mission to prove that hard work and grit can take you to measures one can only dream of. This, my friends, is why we love Rocky. The plot is very simple and yet it is energetic. Following the story line of the droopy-eyed, macho Italian giving his full perseverance and dedication to a shot at destiny is truly a motivational event. Stallone needs a round of applause because this movie is not just about a breakthrough for Rocky Balboa, but a breakthrough for himself as well. <br/><br/>The journey of Rocky Balboa quickly turned him into a very lovable character. Sly Stallone's part as Rocky is a match made in Heaven. The combination of Stallone's capability to play a physical beast and his ability to release true, raw emotion, makes his portrayal of Rocky a masterful job. This very rough, but sociable character pairs with the painfully shy, pet store worker, Adrian (Talia Shire). The two somehow, someway make an admirable couple that unite together. The love and affection they have is real and it can easily be felt in the last scene where Rocky squares off with Apollo Creed. Despite this being one of the greatest fight scene in movie history, it's that strong connection between Rocky and Adrian that really seals the deal. It is that groan of ""Adrian!' that Balboa screams as Adrian cries out ""I love you"", in the midst of reporters trying to huddle around them. This scene is just a small example of the talent of acting and the colorful characterizations that blend together to make memorable movie icons.<br/><br/>Besides the terrific story and the heart-felt acting, there are many other aspects of Rocky that make its originality stand out. One in particular is Rocky's famous workout montage, where ""Gonna Fly Now"" by Bill Conti plays as Rocky sprints up the stairs of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He thrusts his arms up in triumph in such a scene that would make the laziest of people have an itch to hit the gym. No one will ever forget other unique scenes in which Rocky incorporates interesting training methods that include drinking raw eggs and hitting frozen meat. This is the kind of stuff that builds onto the concept of a movie and more importantly, makes a viewer smile. Without question, this movie has the power to incorporate itself in your mind and motivate you to achieve what you thought was achievable."

","There are those with a lot of brains and those with a lot of brawn; both paths offer their share of opportunities and temptations. For those with more muscle than smarts, the world of professional boxing may offer a viable true calling, but a shot at the title is a rare privilege. Rocky is the story of a man who's given that rare privilege, and rises to the challenge to prove that he's more than just a bum off the streets.<br/><br/>If nothing else, Rocky Balboa is one of the most iconic characters in cinema, and his training scenes are among some of the most iconic scenes in film history. The film's biggest action occurs at the beginning and end, with the dramatic and intense boxing matches; in between, the film focuses less on boxing and more on the drama surrounding the character. It is a compelling drama, filled with violent outbursts and pathological struggles that really help define the characters and make the story relevant. However, the film does lose its momentum in the middle, and the plot becomes a bit random before Rocky shapes up and finally fights Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>Despite some drag, the film does have a compelling story. Most of the film's power resides in the main character, who is a perfectly lovable good guy with a good heart, but is constantly forced to hurt people to make ends meet; when he isn't in the ring, he uses his brawn on the street. However, much of the film is about Rocky rising out of the gutter and becoming something more than what he is; on a fundamental level, the film embodies an inspirational power and thematic depth that could apply to anybody in the world. It ultimately amounts to a full manifestation of the American dream: the story of a man who defies all odds and all adversities to rise out of the lower class and fight on the same level as a heavyweight champion. It doesn't even matter if Rocky wins or loses; he proves definitively that there's more than one way to win in life.<br/><br/>This film is as rough and gritty as they come. The photography is solid and steady, but with some very drab and grainy color schemes. Sylvester Stallone has never had much elegance in his roles, but as Rocky, he works within his limitations and takes full advantage to give his character decent depth and nuance. I always found Burt Young's character totally unlikable, but Talia Shire is cute. Carl Weathers is not bad as Apollo Creed, and Burgess Meredith is awesome. Writing is pretty good overall. This production uses some very real-looking sets, props, and costumes. The locales are especially interesting, because they look so scuzzy most of the time, it paints a pretty grim world around Rocky, which help give his struggles more weight. Bill Conti's music score is quite iconic and uplifting.<br/><br/>The history of the film is pretty interesting as well, given that Stallone's own life mirrors Rocky's to a point. Much like the boxer he portrays, Stallone started off poor and obscure, but took a chance on a script that seemed like it'd be a long shot. That script turned into this movie; this movie turned into a franchise, and Stallone is still successful to this day.<br/><br/>Although there are parts of this film I find a bit slow, it is a compelling story that's well worth watching. It has a depth and spirit that anybody can draw inspiration from; if you have a dream that seems impossible, you can achieve it if you exercise your talents and go the distance.<br/><br/>Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Good)"

","A cinematic icon was created in 1976 when Sylvester Stallone took on the role of the underdog boxer Rocky Balboa, who fights to become champion in an upcoming match against master boxer Apollo Creed. From the opening shots of the grittiness of where Rocky is living, Rocky is a sports drama that will never be forgotten. Everything about Rocky seems real; the characters, the locations, the drama, the boxing match, everything in Rocky seemed extremely realistic. Sylvester Stallone gives a very convincing and incredible performance as Rocky, very real and very believable. No wonder why Roger Ebert declared Stallone as ""the next Marlon Brando"" back in the day. While Stallone is definitely no Brando in today's time, Rocky makes Marlon Brando feel like a chicken. This film is awesome, one of the best films of the 1970's. I would love to run down the streets of Philadelphia to the tune of ""Gonna Fly Now"" any day of the week!"

A drama that consists of realistic dreams and goals involving authentic emotion and struggle.<br/><br/>Amazing as this story may be, what will astound audiences even more is when they discover that this story reflects the life of its main star, Sylvester Stallone. Before this movie, Stallone was also down on his luck too. He needed a break in a career and this is the film that shot him to the top. Stallone had been in a few other movies before hand but none that truly focused on him or propelled him to popularity. That was his chance to make it big. What helps make the story feel even more authentic is the fact that Stallone had wrote the story. This is why it reflects as a parallel to his past.<br/><br/>In the writing, Stallone also includes a love interest with a girl named Adrian played by Talia Shire. As the movie plays out, viewers will see her character transform thanks to the charm of Rocky. Together their chemistry blooms into something greater and it's the sweetest and most innocent thing. What's also great about Stallone's writing is that Rocky has a very large antagonist. It's not the heavy weight champion that Carl Weathers plays - Apollo Creed, it's much bigger. That antagonist is called LIFE. Life is one of those things where it can seem like nothing will ever straighten out. And that's real, for everyone because everyone goes through a struggle in his or her life. Very few have it easy all the time.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing is well put together too. James Crabe as the director of photography took some very large shots that helped emphasize the magnitude of this match. Richard Halsey and Scott Conrad's editing is cut appropriately so that each sequence has a consistent flow. And as for music, Bill Conti's score to the film is so emotionally attached to the story it's hard to let go of the feelings that it evokes. Either when it comes to Rocky being alone with a light tread on the piano keys or when he's training with all the string instruments playing, the right emotion is emitted. All around and excellent drama.<br/><br/>This sports drama works extraordinarily well because of how relatable it is when it comes to the struggle of life; how to deal with its ups and downs. And the moral is to never, ever give up. Every element works here."

","Rocky Balboa is a small time boxer whose life is going nowhere until fate intervenes when the heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed issues a challenge and gives Rocky the chance of a lifetime. A fight in which Rocky strives to not win but to just go the distance.<br/><br/>A true underdog story at its heart with tremendous performance that will tug at your heart strings and hit your emotions in a wave of pure entertainment. There is plenty of heart and soul to this story, be it the tale of romance between Rocky and his object of desire the shy but beautiful Adrian, the boxing is top notch and truly the anchor to this entire film. The score is a wonderful addition to the movie that truly carries the soul of the film. Carl Weathers is a pure pleasure to watch as he takes on his finest role of his career. This is one of the classic of film that many have seen and that many love and cherish. Spawning 5 sequels, all which have their own merits but none of them seem to be able to recapture the magic that is Rocky. A true classic that can be enjoyed again and again by any fan of film."

","In 1975, an unknown actor by the name of Sylvester Stallone, went to see the boxing match between Muhammad Ali vs Chuck Wepner fight. In this fight, everyone said that Chuck Wepner would last 2, maybe 3 rounds at most. What actually happened was chuck Wepner was knocked out in the last 20 seconds of the 15th and final round, even managing to knock Ali down in the 9th round. Stallone was so impressed and inspired by this, he decided to write a script about a lone underdog who gets a shot at the title. Armed with only $1,000,000 as the budget, Stallone started work on one of the most influential and famous films of all time: Rocky.<br/><br/>The film is about a guy named Rocky Balboa, a down on his luck part time boxer, part time loan shark enforcer. His life isn't really going anywhere and he lives in a grotty apartment in Philadelphia. He spends his time trying to impress Adrian, sister of his friend Paulie. His trainer, Mikey Goldmill has given up on him, due to him thinking that Rocky is a 'Tomato', and not a contender, like other boxers who go to his boxing Gym.<br/><br/>At the same time, the current champion Apollo Creed is set to fight Mac lee green, the top contender. Unfortunately, Mac Lee green breaks his hand while training, and all the other ranked contenders are unavailable to fight. Apollo then come up the idea of, instead of fighting a ranked contender, he will fight an unknown boxer for the chance of the heavyweight title. He then decides to fight Rocky, due to his boxer name of 'The Italian Stallion'. Rocky then takes this opportunity to go the distance, not for glory or respect, but for his own self-respect, to prove to himself that he has what it takes to go 15 rounds with the champion.<br/><br/>Every single thing about this film is flawless. I wouldn't change a single thing about this movie. Here's why: First of all, the acting is spotless. Everyone from Stallone as Rocky, to Carl weathers as Apollo Creed, to even Burgess Meredith as the grouchy Mikey Goldmill. All the actors deliver and then some. There isn't a single actor that is anything less than perfect.<br/><br/>Next, is the script. The script is unbelievably good. There are tons of memorable lines and no badly written lines at all. All the lines have some importance some where, without coming across as preachy, cliché or soppy at all.<br/><br/>Next, you have the pacing. It is without fault. It gives you plenty of story without feeling slow at all. There are also the famous montage, but even though that was in here, the pacing doesn't feel spoiled or ruined in anyway.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is how much heart it has. Rocky is just an average guy, who is given the chance of a life time. He doesn't feel like he can do it at all, which is what makes it brilliant. In all other films, the protagonist feels 100% like they can do it, which comes across as predictable. Rocky, however doesn't fall into that trap. Rocky himself is full of doubt, and that makes him realistic. An the fact he accepts the challenge for unselfish reasons makes Rocky Balboa one of the greatest movie characters of all time. The fact that he also doesn't give up during the fight makes him even better.<br/><br/>The fight is also very well done. I find that there is more heart in that 8 and a half minutes than in the entirety of most movies that are released now. The fact that Rocky gets up, even though his trainer tells him not to, just shows how much he won't give up.<br/><br/>I also have to talk about the score. Words cannot describe how good the score is. It's emotional and kicks in that the right time. The Rocky theme in it's self is legendary, and has been used as many times as Rocky has been punched in the entire six movies.<br/><br/>This movie basically kick started Stallone's career as an actor, writer and director, as he would go on to direct 4 of the six Rocky films.<br/><br/>10/10. A true classic."

","""Rocky"", is the first movie of a franchise that many people love and adore. Hell, go online and look at the user reviews and see how many people feel about this movie (Or the multiple videos of people running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art). Though I have never been the biggest fan of the franchise, I am for the first time currently watching the movies with a friend who is. Even though I don't adore all these movies like a lot of other people do, I can clearly see why they are so highly regarded.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone (Who also wrote the script) stars as Rocky Balboa, an underground boxer who consistently wins yet earns little prize money, residing in a rundown Philadelphia town. Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), decides to give one underdog a shot at the title choosing Rocky because of his nickname ""The Italian Stallion"". Rocky is grateful yet refuses the offer, but after a change of heart he later accepts. Training with Paulie (Burt Young), who allows Rocky to train by punching meat in the factory he works at and old boxing coach Mickey (A brilliant performance from Burgess Meredith), who also offers his fighting expertise to Rocky. In his downtime, Balboa also tries to form a relationship with Paulie's shy sister Adrian (Talia Shire). After a couple of training montages here and there, Rocky is ready and does it really matter if he will win? We have gotten to know and love the character so much, either way you'll be cheering his name.<br/><br/>Stallone really had a heart for this film, and obviously has done a very good job on making Rocky such an icon over instalments. John G. Avildsen has shot the film very well to capture the Philadelphia street-life, and the boxing match at multiple angles (Though with any simulated sport, some of the hits don't make contact). Bill Conti's music has obviously passed into the stuff of legend, and one thing I love about the Rocky films is that every one of them has a different era and form of music in their soundtracks. Sure you can have ""Survivor"" playing, but the first score remains superior and the very well orchestrated pieces give bleak yet optimistic views of inner city life (Listen to ""Philadelphia Morning"", you'll understand what I mean).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: There's brilliant acting and a bit of a predictable script, but nevertheless it's a film full of heart. Rocky is a great underdog story and who doesn't love the underdog? 9/10."
"antagonist117","8","0","0","16 November 2013"," Back when Rocky was a real guy, not just a symbol
","Everyone knows that Rocky represents underdogs, the American dream, the spirit of the Italian immigrant community, and Philadelphia. He represents those things so effectively that at some point in the history of the Rocky franchise the tail starts to wag the dog, and he starts to do things that might make sense for America itself to do—like waging the Cold War—instead of things that make sense for a soft-hearted, unprepossessing guy from the neighborhood to do. But watch the Rocky film that won the Academy Award and it's clear that the character as originally conceived by Sylvester Stallone is more than just a simple shorthand for the USA. For example, he's a little vain. He doesn't have much to show for himself after ten years in the lower echelons of the boxing circuit, but he does have an unbroken nose, and he's clearly ""proud o' dat."" He also notices when a poster of him has the wrong color scheme for his boxing shorts. The promoter replies, ""It doesn't really matter, does it?"" but to Rocky it does. He's obviously not as flashy as heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (and Apollo, it must be noticed, embodies in his own way American pomp-and-circumstance and American mythmaking), but he doesn't think Creed's a clown for the way he shows off. On the contrary, he admires Creed, and when he says that Creed ""looks like a big flag"" it's just a statement of fact, with no hint of censure. Rocky's love of animals is another interesting quirk. In a meat freezer his pressing question is who killed all the cows, and when someone sees his beloved pet turtles as potential meals he's not amused. As a boxer he probably feels more like meat or a bird in a cage than a human sometimes. These hints of depth in Rocky's character aren't there to be belabored and overanalyzed, though. They're there to help make him seem real, like people we know or can easily imagine to exist. After all, he's not just some one-dimensional cartoon in star- spangled shorts; that's supposed to be Creed. Until, perhaps inevitably, it is Rocky, in Rocky IV. But it wasn't always that way."
"cwbellor","Null","0","0","12 November 2013"," Rocky will touch your heart with one punch!
","In the 1970s, a film had to emerge to squash all the Italian American stereotypes perpetuated by The Godfather. Instead of murdering criminals, we get a much more dignified depiction of this ethnic group in the slow-minded, loan shark enforcer who looks like he probably smells. Rocky is a simple, lovable, and soon to be heroic type who only has two talents – ice skating with no ice skates and boxing. When cheerful champ, Apollo Creed seeks to stroke his ego by stroking an amateur boxer across the face, Rocky is the one with the lucky number. Apollo is appropriately named considering that his ego is certainly of God-like proportions.<br/><br/>Burgess Meredith plays the gravely-voiced, gnome-like trainer, Mickey. This is a guy who looks like he would shank you sooner than thank you after you toss him a towel. But over all, he's got sort of a fatherly, Gandalfy vibe about him. If he had a magic staff, he would most certainly whack you on the head with it after bestowing some wisdom upon you.<br/><br/>Rocky falls for the bespectacled pet shop girl Adrian. Adrian may stand out as the one sane person in this story, simply because she is obviously not happy living in a dank-looking, quasi-dilapidated Philadelphia. The love story between these two is a charming tale of what happens when glum meets goon. <br/><br/>In one of the movie's classic scenes, Rocky takes out his frustration on a piece of dead animal. Meat packers beware! Your tenderized cuts will be pulverized if you let this guy into the locker. When he's done sparring with his food, you won't know whose blood has been shed, Balboa's or the bovine's. <br/><br/>You will not be underwhelmed by this underdog story. Rocky is and forever will be a classic. It's a reminder of a time when films could be heartfelt without being sappy. The character is obviously a lovable dope, but if you're looking for the truth about the human condition, you will find it in Stallone's puppy dog-eyed performance. The fear and desire in those soon-to-be swollen eyes reveal what is ever present in the hearts and minds of us all, the need to be a champion."

","Although I've seen this film countless times over the years, it's been a while since I last saw it and I caught it on TV earlier today. Once again, I was touched by this story of the rise of the underdog Rocky. This film has such heart and warmth and in my experience, there is little out there to rival it in terms of you wanting to cheer for the protagonist to succeed.<br/><br/>Add to this some fine performances, notably Burgess Meredith. the gnarled old trainer, looking for a last chance to train a real winner.<br/><br/>I often thought that Rocky II was better. In some ways it was, but there is a special magic about the original, a depth, both with the characterisation and the terrific acting, that the sequels lacked.<br/><br/>The film contains one line that I think is one of my absolute favourites. Rocky tells Mickey: ""You stop this fight, I'll kill ya"" When you see it, in the context in which it is said, you will see what I mean! I don't think there is much in Sylvester Stallone's later acting career that can rival this one. I could watch this any number of times and never get tired of it."

","""In comes this big lug who weighed 220lbs, didn't talk well, and acted slightly punch drunk. He said he had an idea for a boxing script and wanted to star in it"" - Rocky Producer Irwin Winkler.<br/><br/>To make things slightly clearer, Let me paint the picture, the year was 1976 and a 31 year old had a script which took him just three days to write, but he wasn't just content with just a measly writing credit, he was adamant in the fact that he wanted to play as the lead, he was offered mine boggling figure to sell the script outright so that producer and execs could add a more recognizable lead – because let's face it, the guy so strapped for cash, had to appear in – well let's just say, films of a adult nature , for a messily 200 bucks, just to make ends meet, then for the next few year he had the occasional lead role, in let's just say, not the most fashionable of films, but mostly his body of work consisted of bit parts. Then when he was able to retain his place as the lead of the film – well the rest was history, the guys name was Sylvester Stallone (eventual star of the Rambo films and The Expendables) and the film was called 'Rocky', which went on to nominations for Best Actor and Best Screenplay at the 49 Academy Awards, making the Stallone the third man in history to be nominated for those two award from the same film. The film itself was the very first sports film to win Best Picture and even picked up a Best Director for John G. Avildsen (The Karate Kid).<br/><br/>Your classical rags to riches story, as a poor young man from Philadelphia, takes the opportunity to fight the world heavy weight champion, whilst at the same time trying to win love. I felt it was an almost herculean effort for a first time writer. Although true it's a simple premise, I would admit. It takes no Newton to understand, but there is genius in its simplicity, and because of that enduring quality it renders it as a powerful and inspirational film that strikes a chord with so many of us. Rocky it a film that the whole family can enjoy over and over again, well the first Rocky anyway, did I forget to mention that there were 5 sequels that all sucked, to the existent that they became a parody of themselves. But no matter how bad they get – and they do get bad, they will never distract from the genies and uplifting Rocky, with the killer sound track ""Gonna Fly Now "" (my new ring tone) played over the montage(which inspired me to work out) is probably one of my favorite sequences in film, but wait we can't forget the stair running scene, so iconic it's ridiculous, I would literally swim to America just so I could run up the steps (if I still have the energy left over from the swim) But all in all in my opinion rightly so that Rocky was the winner of Best Picture award."

","Packed house. Little town. As the opening credits rolled ""written by Sylvester Stallone"" you could hear the whispers. And a lot of female whispers. Incredulous, like, ""He wrote the movie!"" Instant credibility. Times were different then and I'm not really talking about in the general sense but relative to this movie. No one, and I mean no one, knew who the hell Sylvester Stallone was (save for a few soft porn aficionados). But this movie captured the imagination of the American public and everyone was talking about him now.<br/><br/>This movie transcended sports. So many people could relate to this. Obviously the sports lover, as it is a boxing movie. But it has a love story interwoven through it too. The movie builds like a wave. From the opening scene to the climatic finale, it just grabbed a hold of people. Maybe for anyone who has ever been down and out, or maybe it was the gritty realism. Something. Young, old, male, female, people were talking about it.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a low-budget fight (""low-budget"" from perspective that it's a pro fight, but it's not heavily attended and the fighters earn a pittance). It's interesting. You get involved with his life. It builds. He gets his shot. Then Mickey shows up at his apartment. Wants to be his MANAGER! But he had just recently come down on Rocky and Rocky was seriously ticked. Mickey leaves unceremoniously and starts walking down the long staircase. Rocky knows Mickey can hear him and he just unleashes on him. Maybe it's a lifetime of anger. Maybe it's everything, but he verbally tears into him. ""Talkin' about your prime. What about my prime, Mick? At least you had a prime!"" It was like, wow, the dude CAN act. Rocky continues the verbal barrage and you think that's the end of their relationship. Cut to Rocky walking out the door (with no corresponding audio) and you can tell he's asking Mickey to help him. I remember how that scene got to my father. It had the power to strike a nerve.<br/><br/>And Talia Shire. She was known (I mean she was in the two ""Godfather"" movies). But she wasn't that well known. You really believed she was this homely looking gal. Later, trying to get intimate, Rocky takes off her glasses and he says how pretty she is and I could hear another one of those female whispers, saying ""She DOES have pretty eyes."" It was interesting.<br/><br/>***Spoilers ahead*** Get to the fight at the end. There's such a buildup. In the first round when Rocky drops Apollo Creed with a left, the movie theater ERUPTED. A guy in front of me rose to his feet, arms high in the air and was like, ""Yeah!"" I can remember my dad laughing. Not at the movie. Just at the spectacle of being in a movie theater that so resembled a real boxing ring.<br/><br/>I'll stop it there, without completely spoiling the movie. I mean, I'm sure most have seen this movie, but there's people born every day who have not. I just wanted people to know the effect this movie had on the American movie-watching public (and probably beyond), how it had the power to catapult a then unknown actor named Sylvester Stallone on to super stardom and what an amazing time it was to watch it all happen."

","I saw this movie when it came out. I was 13 then so that kind of makes me an old man now. I loved this movie then and I love it just as much now. I think where people are misled is that they feel this is considered strictly a boxing movie. In fact it is part love story as well. It 's funny because as you get older your taste changes in regards to your likes and dislikes. There were movies years ago I thought were good and now I consider them just OK. This movie, however, still moves me. The musical score is well done and provides emotion to the film. I think the only character that may have been done better is Pauly. Other than that this movie is intense and for a film made in 1976 the fight scenes are done pretty good. If you watch them though, there are flaws chronologically. Example, in the later rounds Rocky has no sweat on him in or bruises on his face or you will see a lot of empty seats in the arena. Just things to pick out. When you do watch this and you get to the part where Apollo Creed is being introduced and he is dressed like George Washington throwing money, you can hear someone laugh as if they were laughing at him. Yeah, the little things can be entertaining as well."

","Rocky (1976), featuring Sylvester Stallone, as Rocky Balboa, a down on his luck debt collector who finds himself in the middle of the fight of his life. Rocky is an amateur boxer, who is going nowhere fast, is given the opportunity to fight the heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, who is played by Carl Weathers. Rocky's boxing skills are very raw at first, but with the help of a gritting old boxing trainer, played by Burgess Meredith, turns into a hard-hitting boxer. Rocky is a sports drama, which deals with redemption across many different aspects. The director uses many different camera angles to give the audience the feeling of actually taking the hits from Apollo Creed during the scene at the end of the film. Throughout the film, the audience sees the struggles that Rocky has both in and out of the boxing ring. By the end of the film, the audience really connects with Rocky and is pulling for him every punch that is thrown. The cinematographer uses two great montages to cover a lengthy period of time when Rocky is training with Mick as well as the final rounds of the fight. The training scene is one of the great series of scenes of the 1970s films. The famous Rocky run has been shown in numerous different films and television shows, including The Simpsons, Nutty Professor, and The Fresh Prince of Bel- Air. Both of these theatrical montages are put to great soundtrack music that brings the audience further into overall experience.<br/><br/>The director also uses levels of lighting throughout the film to show how Rocky's luck is changing. Rocky also resurrects himself by having a relationship with Adrian, played by Talia Shire. The lighting throughout Rocky and Adrian's interaction together, goes from low-light when Rocky first meets Adrian in the pet shop to when Adrian is shown in the audience at the fight, there is more of a glow put on her. This lighting is also used throughout when Rocky is interacting with Mick. At first, the audience sees Mick and Rocky having a falling out at the boxing facility, but by the end of the important training, there is a brighter feeling to Mick and Rocky's interaction. <br/><br/>Rocky is a great film that deals with redemption of a small town hero. This film is set in Philadelphia, the same as another film about redemption, The Invincible. The Invincible is the story of Vince Papale, who tries out for the Philadelphia Eagles and makes the team. This is a very long shot due to Vince being too small and weak. This is the concept of Rocky Balboa as well, too small to compete against Apollo. Both of these characters proved everyone wrong and despite their size, they always had the heart to continue forward. Rocky is one of the greatest sports films that also have a great back story of redemption and resurrection."

","Rocky is a film that focuses on a small time boxer named Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and his life on the tough streets Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Rocky whose nickname is the Italian Stallion, is joined by a supporting cast of his best friend Paulie (Burt Young), his love interest Adrian (Talia Shire), his tough spoken trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith), and his biggest opponent ever faced in a boxing ring Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa is a small time street thug that survives by collecting debts for a local loan shark and taking low paying fights in a local fight club. Rocky sees himself as a bum, and that is reinforced many times throughout the movie when many people refer to him as a bum including his trainer and father figure Mickey. Rocky does have a dream to be more in life and this can be seen in the symbolism shown in the names of Rocky's pets, his two turtles, ""Cuff & Links"", and his fish, ""Mobey Dick"". Rocky sees the ""Cuff links"" as a status of wealth, and ""Mobey Dick"" as being the biggest fish in the boxing world. While you may see Rocky as a tough guy, his image is softened when he does not have the heart to follow through with breaking the thumb of a person that fails to fulfill his debt to the local loan shark, or in Rocky's love for animals, which leads him to meet his love interest, Adrian. <br/><br/>Rocky's life changes when Apollo Creed the Heavy Weight Champion of the World, comes to town to promote a fight offering a virtual unknown a shot at the Heavy Weight title. It becomes obvious that Apollo does not consider Rocky a real contender because we never really see him train for the fight. This is reinforced when Apollo's trainer sees Rocky on a news segment and tells Apollo he needs to come take a look at the guy he's going to be fighting. Apollo dismisses his trainer's suggestion by talking about business investments to others in the room.<br/><br/>As Rocky trains for the fight you see his progression during the training and know he is ready for the biggest fight of his life as he sprints to the top of the long stairway to the Philadelphia Art Museum, backed by the inspirational song ""Gonna Fly Now"" by Bill Conti. Rocky and Apollo Creed meet in the ring and it is obvious this is just a show to Apollo, but he soon finds out he may also be in the biggest fight of his life when Rocky knocks him to the mat for the first time in his career. The fight has its dramatic up's and down's but goes the distance for a split decision. Rocky may not have won the fight, but he wins in life, putting behind his image of being a bum and giving him a shot at his dream of wealth and success. Rocky is a ""Rags to Riches"" story much like Cinderella Man (2005), it gives us hope that with the right opportunities anyone can be someone."

","Rocky opens on the title character engaged in a boxing match in what appears to be a makeshift ring in a dark, smoke-filled, modestly populated, abandoned church. Rocky wins the bout and bums a half-smoked cigarette on his way to his locker. In spite of his victory, a woman in the crowd puts him down, calling him a bum. Nevertheless, he'll take home ""winner's share"" that night for his effort: a little over forty dollars. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is down on his luck and down for the count, which, in boxing lingo, means that he's running out of time. He's not the only one. His friend Paulie (Burt Young), who still lives with his sister Adrian (Talia Shire), bemoans that they're all gonna die alone. Rocky's a nobody surrounded by ""losers"" on their way to nowhere. And then he wins the lottery. The world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), suddenly out a ranked contender to fight in an upcoming bicentennial event in Philadelphia, decides to pick a local boxer at random to fill in. He gives the title shot to Rocky (of course) because he likes his nickname: ""The Italian Stallion."" Rocky's take for fighting the champ will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Like other lottery winners, Rocky's friends step out of the woodwork to capitalize on his fortune. Paulie comes up with an advertising angle using Rocky's name. Rocky's loan-shark boss, Gazzo, gives him five hundred bucks for ""training expenses"" and says not to worry about it, but we know he expects some return on his investment. And Mickey (Burgess Meredith), who recently gave away Rocky's locker at his local gym, comes knocking on his door to offer him his management services. The only one immune to the bandwagon effect is Adrian. Stallone, who also wrote Rocky, smartly positions the scene in which Rocky and Adrian fall for each other before Creed's promoter, Jergens, makes Rocky his offer. Rocky is an extremely well-written movie, especially in the dialogue and character arenas. Each of the principal characters is given distinctive, nuanced characteristics, believable motivations, and strong development, filled out by four Oscar-nominated performances. Naturally rhythmic dialogue is punctuated by bursts of relationship-defining moments: Mickey spouting his disappointment in Rocky's choice to become a ""leg-breaker"" instead of a respectable fighter, Rocky temporarily fending off Mickey's last-ditch effort to soak up some of Rocky's glory, Adrian's defense against Paulie's unsubstantiated rant. Rocky is also an extremely well-scored movie. If the outstanding writing, acting, directing, and editing hasn't already done the job, Bill Conti's original music will virtually guarantee that the viewer feels everything that this film is about. ""Philadelphia Morning""—which accompanies the first training scene, the one in which Rocky can't make it all the way up the steps—embodies tender regret for a life possibly wasted and an opportunity possibly granted too late in the game. Counterpoint that with the longing, uplifting, victorious song ""Gonna Fly Now""—which is played when he does make his way up the steps, salvaging, for the moment, a bit of hope. The war music underscoring the final fight (""Going the Distance"") is indescribably moving, especially in the middle, where it breaks down into a sad, lonely, struggling violin, as Rocky tries desperately to stand up, while Mickey, like a father protecting his son, pleads with him to ""stay down."" The framing of this fight, inspired by an actual bout in which Chuck Wepner lasted fifteen rounds with Muhammad Ali, dramatically demonstrates the award-winning directing talent of John G. Alvidsen and the award-winning editing talents of Richard Halsey and Scott Conrad. Like any effective drama, this final showdown fully exposes the heart of the film. It's obvious that Apollo Creed possesses superior athletic ability over Rocky. It's possible that Creed is just not in the best shape of his career, and that Rocky's left-handedness is throwing him off balance. But none of this really matters. When the fight announcer wonders aloud what could be keeping Rocky up, the probable answer has nothing to do with boxing ability. What is keeping him up is an iron will forged by a lifetime of being stepped over, knocked around, and kicked aside: the kind of life that can turn any man into a force to be reckoned with. After the fight is over, Rocky tries to field questions from the ring announcer, but he quickly realizes he's never been in this situation before. Like a scared child who has wandered too far from home, he calls for his mother, and she rescues him. Rocky loses the decision, but he's beaten the clock; he's still standing during the final bell, he's proved himself a winner to his hometown, he's redeemed his self-respect, and he's won Adrian's heart. Fitting rewards for the ultimate underdog in movie history."

","to be honest 8.1 is incredibly too low for this movie. this is what excellent filmmaking all across the board looks like. it had fantastic performances from everyone (sylvester Stallone Talia shire and burgess Meredith especially) some of the most heart wrenching and emotionally gripping writing ever. and easily one of the greatest and most remembered and celebrated musical scores of all time. we open on rocky whom is already at the tail-end of his career (albeit the following movies)and every scene you see him in you keep seeing the passion in his eyes. the passion for becoming a great fighter but also the passion for earning the love of Adrian. and this is where the movie adds a whole nother dimension is the love story in the movie. its very believable and not the least bit touched up by Hollywood standards. the movie is an absolute triumph there's no other way of saying it. this is my favorite movie of all time and i recommend it to every person who just loves a movie that will make you feel inspired"
"lanceshiff93","8","0","0","2 October 2012"," Rocky
","There was a lot of grouping in this film, let alone the entire Rocky series. The biggest one, however, is the idea of the comeback. It seems that no matter what, Rocky is always down. Whether it be life in general, or just a boxing match. He is always on the bad side of things and digs himself in hole but no matter what obstacles block his path, he climbs out of the hole and comes out on top. And it doesn't matter that he loses the championship fight, because he still wins the moral victory and is happy with what he achieves. There is no question that Rocky is a warrior and he will fight no matter the odds.<br/><br/>The reason why I feel Rocky is always down in the beginning is because it makes the victory so much sweeter. Avildsen uses this idea to keep the audience on the edge of their seat. Right when you think it's all over for Rocky, he comes from out of nowhere and wins. Rocky's victory would definitely not be as great without seeing the struggles he had to go through.<br/><br/>A huge scene in the movie, which I thought was the initial turning point of the film, was when Mickey, the gym owner, tells Rocky he is nothing. Rocky goes into the gym locker room, as usual, but when he tries to open his locker, there is someone else's stuff in there. He is then told he is kicked out of the gym because he is going nowhere with his career. He doesn't fight anyone big and is not moving up in the boxing world and Mickey lets him know that. This was rock bottom for Balboa. He could've just gave up boxing all together at this point but that is not what he does. When the world has got him down, he fights back, and that is exactly what Rocky does. He uses Mickey's words as motivation and eventually returns to him, begging to help Rocky train for the title fight against the current champion, Apollo Creed. Without Mickey telling him, Rocky doesn't get the motivation to do great things and does not do as well in the title fight, so this is a big scene in the film.<br/><br/>Sports movies are known to have happy endings. The protagonist faces adversity but overcomes it and ends up with the victory. This is true and false in ""Rocky."" He is faced with difficulties and does overcome them but he still comes up short in the end. Even though he works so hard and dedicates all of his time and effort into achieving one goal, defeating Apollo Creed, he still loses. Even though this happens, Rocky still feels he is a winner. He gets his life back together, he earns the respect of the entire boxing world, he still has his girl, Adrian, and he proves that Apollo Creed is not invincible. I would count that as a win in my book. So it just goes to show that even if you lose the ""main event,"" it is what you learn from the whole experience that matters."

","Rocky, the main character has a sense of loneliness that seems to follow him until he gets to know Adrian where he begins to be able to reach out and have convenience in himself for activities that he has wanted to always accomplish.<br/><br/>In the film ""Rocky,"" the producers are able to create a sense of loneliness and suspense by using different lighting techniques. While watching the film, I noticed that whenever Rocky was by himself or walking away from other people, he would be venturing into the dark. I was on the edge of my seat seeing if he would get into an altercation with another person. Rocky's apartment is dark and he has a depressed face when he is in there by himself. As soon as he invites Adrian over to the apartment, the whole lighting in the apartment changes to a brighter more inviting place that was not seen when he was there alone.<br/><br/>There are many scenes in the film, that Rocky is placed alone. He spends the majority of the time alone, isolated from many of the people that truly care about time. There are only a few scenes in which Adrian is present. Andrea is one person that Rocky is able to connect with and feels comfortable around. In the scenes where he is isolated, he has a depressed mood to him that will be able to show that unpleasant activities has gone on in his pasted and may be explained in his future activities. Some of the scenes where Rocky is surrounded by other individuals, I was able to get a sense that he still felt as if he was alone. The people he is involved with do not give enjoyment such as the mafia. I get the feeling from the film that the only reason he is involved with them is because he feels that he will never be able to make something of his life. This is thought is reinforced by his trainer saying that you could have been a great boxer but you never took the chance.<br/><br/>I feel as the gym where Rocky works out is not just a place where he can become a better boxer. I get the feeling that Rocky goes to the gym to connect with his past and remember the times that he was a good fighter. I think that Rocky goes there with a hope that someday he will get the chance again and he will be able to take it.<br/><br/>I think that Sylvester Stallone portrayed the part of Rocky well. I believe he was able to transform himself into a person will little education that had to fight for himself his whole life. He also was able to play being lost and trying to find himself in different activities. I was able to feel the struggle with him trying to become someone he was not such as being the person that hunted down someone when they owed money.<br/><br/>""Rocky"" the film is a drama; therefore it is a struggle with finding himself and staying the person that other individuals would like him to be. The producer used music and lighting to add to the suspense of the film to get the audience to feel as though something powerful was going to happen. In the end of the film, during the boxing match, the music gets really loud when the fight is getting close. When Rocky begins to yell her name at the end of the match, the sound is focused on him so everything else is at a lower noise level. With this sound change, I was able see and feel the passion he had for her and with her, he did not feel alone even though he had a large group of people surrounding him.<br/><br/>In Rocky's apartment, he has multiple animals that he got from the pet store Adrian works at. Just how he interacts with these creatures, I was able to see that Rocky has more compassion for not only animals but for all the people he comes across. I was able to take this thought of him having compassion and apply it to other scene such as him walking the teenage girl home, and how he told her that she could become someone great. I was able to get the feeling that he was able to get a joyous feeling from helping people."

The best thing about this film is the real life struggle that Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) goes through. Every time I see this film, I feel like I am watching a brand new story unfold. Rocky Balboa is a small-time boxer that knocks down his opponent, Apollo Creed, the undefeated heavy weight champion. In the beginning of the film, Rocky seems hopeless. However, with help from his trainer Mickey, he is transformed into the man that he was born to be. The film couldn't have been as convincing without Stallone. He captures an essence that isn't really seen in today's films. He is so real in his acting, pure and raw. Rocky is not just about boxing but about how poor man came from nothing to be top heavy weight champion."

","I bought Rocky recently in a sale for a couple of euros. I had'nt seen it in years. I remembered it as a sentimental tale which robbed other greater movies of the Oscar in 1976. I was wrong. It works on every level. It is a gritty movie that earns it's place alongside the other classics of the seventies. The relationship between Paulie and his sister is brilliantly done. Life has been unkind to all the central characters between dead end jobs, poor living conditions and alcohol. They all realise their dreams have been trampled on, but they trying to get on with life. The only character with money is a local gangster. Then Rocky gets a break. From then on, the film builds to a climax taking in doubt, faith, love, confrontation and hope along the way.

","Before Stallone diluted the brand with a series of increasingly ridiculous sequels before finally bringing the franchise back to respectability with ""Rocky Balboa"" there was this little film which is a fine example of the Hollywood formula executed to perfection. The classic underdog tale combines the gritty realism of the 1970's, with the uplifting story of a down on his luck boxer who gets the chance of a lifetime when he gets a shot at the World Championship. At its core ""Rocky"" is really a touching love story and working class drama featuring great performances by all the principles (Stallone has never been better) and great direction by John G. Avildsen who won an Oscar for his work. Stallone's screenplay hits all the right notes and it is impossible not to be fully invested in the story by the time the emotional climax hits. There are scenes in this film that left their mark in film history and the film became an inspiration to people around the world. The only downside was that Stallone decided to cash in his characters popularity and made 5 sequels that had varying levels quality. Rocky 2 was entertaining but unnecessary, while Rocky 4 was so utterly ridiculous that the movie has become nothing but an entertaining joke. It's best to forget the sequels because the original is truly a classic example of Hollywood cinema at its absolute best."

"wandereramor","9","0","0","20 February 2012"," Surprisingly great
","In light of the massive media/cultural presence Rocky became, it's remarkable to go back and watch the original movie, and see how little of it actually got captured in the media zeitgeist and the sports genre formula it inspired. Yeah, there are all the scenes you've seen parodied before -- the training montage with raw eggs and the Philadelphia steps, the big fight at the end, etc. -- but nobody remembers that the bulk of this film is a fairly low-key, working class drama. I mean, most of the first hour is just Rocky hanging around the slums and harassing some pet shop girl. It's a lot more subtle and -- dare I say it? -- intellectual than it gets credit for, and it's also the kind of slow build that you could never get away with in a Hollywood movie today.<br/><br/>Of course the more cinematic and bombastic scenes are great as well, and the film earns what could be cheesy moments through the earlier character work. The final fight is sort of ridiculous, but the final minute is cinematic perfection, one of those slightly off-kilter endings that you see so often in this era. We have the big celebration, the Hollywood kiss in the ring, as in the background -- quiet enough that you might not notice it the first time around -- Rocky is announced as the loser by decision. It's a moment that not only has a shocking amount of faith in the audience, but also makes them question their priorities. It's a bombastic Hollywood ending, but not the one we expected.<br/><br/>And that's really what's lead to the success of Rocky. It manages to be a crowd pleaser without losing its integrity as a story, and in doing so forms the perfect bridge between Hollywood blockbuster and New Hollywood art film. If you've never seen this film and don't think you'd like it... you're probably wrong. I was."

"bock_g","10","0","0","3 January 2012"," Oscar bait, clichéd, simple, BUT IT WORKS!!!!
","Rocky is without a doubt one of the best American films of all time. The success of this film is not based on the fact it triumphantly won the Best Picture Oscar against great films such as ""Network"" and ""Taxi Driver"", nor how it revived the whole ""underdog"" genre of sports films-- it's the lovable characters. The premise is simple: a local fighter gets a shot at the World Heavyweight title. Rocky is living a near desolate life working as a loan shark for a local mafioso during the day and fighting underground bouts at night. Despite his dodgy appearance, Rocky is a man who has a good moral personality. The subplot in this film is the romance between Rocky and a shy pet store clerk Adrian (Talia Shire). Adrian is an isolated woman treated rather poorly by her brother Paulie (Burt Young)who is Rocky's close friend. One of the best scenes in the film is the dating scene between Rocky and Adrian at an isolated skating rink. It shows how these two characters are complete polar opposites (Rocky is dim-witted but out-going, and Adrian is clever but detached): it's a stereotypical love moment, but it works because we see how much these two characters have developed beyond their assumed social appearances. Another great character in this film is Mickey (Burgess Meredith) who is Rocky's grouchy manager. Mickey is a father figure and mentor who sees Rocky's talent as a boxer, but disapproves of his lifestyle as a loan shark. Another great scene in the film is when Mickey humbly approaches Rocky to be his manager. He talks about how his own boxing career and how it was wasted because he never had a manager. Rocky is reluctant because he was never approached this way for his first few years of his boxing career. He lashes out his ambivalent feelings towards Mickey and eventually accepts his offer. The rest of the film is predictable, Rocky trains hard, he fights, he loses, but eventually triumphs because he was able to go the distance with the Champion toe to toe, and he embraces Adrian at the end. Oscar bait, clichéd, simple, but it works. Not to mention, Bill Conti's amazing score and one of the first uses of the steadicam were also a contributing factor to how great this film is. Sylvester Stallone is constantly labeled by critics and audiences as the macho action star with limited acting skills, but after watching this film, you would believe he is the reminiscent of a young Marlon Brando. His down-to-earth performance and his great screenplay truly earned him the acclaim he got for this film."

I gotta go to the bathroom."" - Rocky.<br/><br/>Rocky does many things right, but one of the biggest things it does exceptionally well is the dialog it packs in. The wit and humor is subtle but necessary in telling this particular story, and it only helps when a little ray of sunlight is shed on a premise so serious.<br/><br/>What can be said about the 1976 film Rocky that hasn't already been said countless times before? That's the greatest challenge in reviewing classics, personally. When I reviewed National Lampoon's Animal House, I found myself often pausing for a long period of time or getting up and walking around contemplating what else to say. Was that it? Only five paragraphs? Surely a film so monumental deserves more than just five paragraphs.<br/><br/>But I digress. It's difficult to review a film that has been seen by everyone, and for you yourself to try and write something unique and fresh about a film so cherished without sounding pretentious is quite a difficult task. Rocky tells the emotional and inspiring parable of an underdog fighter nicknamed ""The Italian Stallion"" (Stallone) who is thirty and broke, living in the slums getting his face and body beat to hell for barely any money. He forms a relationship with a nerdy pet-shop employee named Adrian (Shire), and is given the opportunity of a lifetime to fight against champion fighter Apollo Creed (Weathers).<br/><br/>Motivated by Adrian, and trained by her brother Paulie (Young), Rocky continues to become more confident in his abilities but at times faces a dark sense of realism that he might not be able to take on the champion. Rocky's training sequence is occupied by the instantly recognizable and famed theme song of the film that only adds to the emotion in the film.<br/><br/>The character Rocky is effortlessly likable and as charismatic as any movie hero should be. What makes him so likable is his persistency and his devotion to becoming more than an underdog, but a true winner in the ring and in life. He's thirty, down and out in Philly, and knows he can do better. Adrian and Paulie prove it to him.<br/><br/>Consider the impact of the scene where Rocky climbs up The Philadelphia Museum of Art staircase to the Rocky theme song. When he finally gets to the top he runs around in circles while repeatedly throwing his arms up in satisfaction. Combined with the music, a fantastic feature to the film, it only assists a great scene and proves that even simple training sequences can be brought to full effect. The scene has spawned numerous other people imitating the event, and a Stallone statue was even placed at the top of the staircase years after.<br/><br/>When we get to the actual fight we are fully immersed in the story. It doesn't seem like a film anymore, but the fight itself might as well be a real-life Pay-Per-View event on Television. We've spent so much time with the character Rocky, and so little time away from him it's not that we can't help but love him, but truly want to see him triumph over Creed. <br/><br/>Actor and writer Sylvester Stallone went around parading the script of Rocky to numerous studios and was turned down multiple times. Mainly because no one really knew how it would turnout. When you think about it, Rocky was one of the first, if not the first, dramatic boxing film released. Expectations were uncertain, but it soon became one of the most successful films in history grossing over $225 million against a $1 million budget. Stallone went on to make five sequels, and has been remembered for his role as the lovable boxer for years. Decades later it still holds up. And Rocky is still one of the most loved and respected underdogs ever filmed. <br/><br/>Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers. Directed by: John G. Alvidsen."

","If the producers of Rocky were to charge a penny each time somebody mentions it, they would have been gazillionaires by now. The story of Rocky and the parallel it drew with its creator Sylvester Stallone's career is still climbing the steps of popularity, and it wouldn't be out of place to mention that it probably is museum-worthy now.<br/><br/>What Rocky means to all the generations that have come to revere and idolize it can be judged from the fact that it has inspired millions and continue to do so. The story of an underdog prizefighter who gets the chance of a lifetime to fight the world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is savage and gritty in appearance but at its core is an emotional tale desperate for its comeuppance. It is heartbreaking one moment, and sweet the next and both the flavors are delivered by Stallone, perhaps for the first and last time, in a very Brandoesque manner. The film brilliantly showcases Rocky's macho moments when he fights and allows him to be adorable, especially in the pet shop scenes involving the reluctant and painfully shy Adrian Pennino (Talia Shire), even when he is working as an arm twister for a local loan shark. Rocky's brawn and Adrian's shyness at first seems to be at odds with each other, but we know they are made for each other when they confess to their weaknesses on their first date.<br/><br/>If Rocky were to put this in words it would be something like this- ""Adrian is the sandpaper that smooths my rough edges, you know."" She, in a much-understated manner, provides the footing to this emotional and heartfelt story with gray undertones mainly added to the mix by an equally brilliant Burt Young as Paulie, Adrian's resentful but a loyal alcoholic brother who shares a special bond with Rocky.<br/><br/>Instead of just providing the obligatory obstacles at every possible turn for its protagonist, Stallone very creatively infuses it with the juices of personality conflicts, blue-collar angst, patronizing elite, and defeated lives yearning to break free- all against the backdrop of boxing. He trains under Mickey Goodmill (Burges Meredith), a forceful but a tragic character who pities Rocky and holds him responsible for his misguided career. His interaction with Rocky is fascinating to watch because it is in his eyes before Adrian takes over we see Rocky from a has-been to a would-be contender. He trains Rocky as if he is exorcising him, which is indeed what he needs. For an average low budget boxing flick to achieve all this in 119 minutes with a completely unknown lead could have been a monumental task, but this film owes its success mainly to the assured direction of John G. Avildsen and a very very well written script penned in not very unlike conditions that Rocky often finds himself in. It has a heart. Rocky is not the perfect example of the Avant-garde cinema of the 70's, but director Avildsen did manage to imbue it with enough charm to make it noticeable in theaters and at the 1977 Academy Awards.<br/><br/>The underdog going the distance to get what is priceless has and would be done in all sorts of manner, but it would be difficult to match the emotional tug that Rocky has mainly because of its title character which sucks the entire energy of the story in a bumbling but affable manner. Alas, the sequels to this movie lost such tenderness when Rocky finally became a brand - another parallel to Sylvester Stallone's career, which is not entirely coincidental."

","Rocky has always been one of my favorite movies of all time. I first saw the film just over 5 years ago and since then I have experienced it an incalculable number of times under many different emotional and locational circumstances. I recently got the chance to watch the film on Blu-Ray and it's just as good as it ever has been. In my eyes, the entire franchise is among the greatest ever, but the original Rocky film from 1976 will forever stand out as more than just a boxing movie, but as a triumph in human spirit and one of the most inspiring movies ever made.<br/><br/>The story follows a smalltime club boxer named Rocky Balboa. His life isn't the most desirable one could have. He lives in a small apartment in Philadelphia and makes a cheap living off of club boxing and collecting debts for a local loan shark. After heavyweight boxing champion, Apollo Creed, offers Rocky a shot at the title, he pledges to go the distance and become a 'somebody' rather than a 'nobody' despite the odds.<br/><br/>The plot comes off as being very basic, but the main appeal of the film isn't the overall narrative structure, but rather the details of character development, acting, writing, music, atmosphere and iconic imagery.<br/><br/>As a character, Rocky would be assumed to be just a dumb brute in the way that he lives his life, but it is revealed that he has a lovable, sympathetic and tolerant nature that is revealed through his relationships with other characters. For example, when collecting a debt he finds that the man is $70 short and rather than break his thumb like you would expect, Rocky lets him off the hook. We also learn about Rocky's patient nature in his efforts to achieve a relationship with a shy store clerk named Adrian. I've always viewed Adrian's love for Rocky as a catalyst for his eventual heroic triumphs. Rocky's accepting qualities are also represented through his relationships with Paulie and Mickey, both of which are strained to an extent. Regardless, Rocky is accepting of them.<br/><br/>These character traits in Rocky Balboa effectively develop him as a character wonderfully and immediately allow us to sympathise with him, but what's also to note is the brilliance of Sylvester Stallone's performance. Many criticise Stallone's acting abilities, but I do feel that he is a great actor. His performance as Rocky is fantastic because of his realised potential as well as his understanding of the character (Read up on the making of the film and you'll understand what I mean by that).<br/><br/>Next to Stallone, the performances by Talia Shire (Adrian), Burt Young (Paulie), Burgess Meredith (Mickey Goldmill) and Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed) are all fantastic. One of the best things about this movie is that every member of the cast fits their character like a glove and I can't imagine any replacement.<br/><br/>Another notable aspect is the outstanding soundtrack composed by Bill Conti. 'Gonna Fly Now' is one of the best pieces of music I've ever heard and always gets me in the mood to amount to something big (when it's not getting me in the mood to watch this masterpiece). The montage that accompanies it in which Rocky runs up the Philadelphia museum staircase is one of the best scenes in history and for good reason has been embedded into our culture to the point in which people run these steps every day. Running those steps is officially one of my life goals.<br/><br/>I've always wanted to work in the film industry, and I know that achieving a big time directorial status is a real challenge, but I have this movie to act as a constant reminder that anybody can amount to anything despite the odds that are against them. After being so exposed to this film on so many occasions I view it as a real motivator and look back at regardless to what I am doing, whether it be exercising, doing well in school or going for a job. It's a movie about following your dreams and the effort it takes to achieve them.<br/><br/>Rocky will forever remain one of my favorite movies of all time for these inspirational qualities that I find to be unmatched and that I can watch it regardless of how I feel and be left astonished, inspired and refreshed. This movie changed my life in many ways and my love for this movie isn't about to change. I cannot recommend this movie more.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This has to be one of the better movies of the 1970's. I am not a big fan of movies from that decade unless it's Jaws, Close Encounters, Star Wars, Alien, The Godfather, Grease, now this. This is truly defined as an American classic. This movie also got the great action junkie Sylvester Stallone from a name nobody heard off to a Grade A actor.<br/><br/>This is about a poor, average boxer who is told that a heavyweight champion wants to fight him. So Rocky trains very hard in order to get ready for the heavyweight match.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Sylvester is an underrated actor and he's been going for years including with the Expendables that came out this year.<br/><br/>This is a true American classic that's not all about boxing. There are a few themes here. And the score by Bill Conti is a memorable one. I rate this movie 9/10."
"ElMaruecan82","10","0","0","11 October 2010"," A ""genuine masterpiece"" and the greatest Sports movie ever made ...
","Every time I visit ""Taxi Driver"", ""Network"" or ""All The President's Men""'s boards, I find people whining about ""Rocky"" winning the Best Picture Oscar in 1977. How did ""Rocky"", a film that is so dull, feel good, old school, stereotypical, manipulative or mass audience appealing (as if that was negative) win over such intelligent masterpieces ? In other words, how could have Stallone beaten Scorsese? Well, maybe because you don't need a complex plot or a dark story conveying the eternal ""everything is crap"" message told in a monotone voice-over, to have a good movie and Rocky is more than a good movie, it is what I would call a ""genuine masterpiece"".<br/><br/>""Rocky"" features ordinary characters with everyday needs and goals in life and there's an authentic feeling in the movie that touches you deeply in the heart, why so? Because it's not about characters, it's about relationships, Rocky is a lovable dim-witted guy and his friend Paulie is definitely not the nicest guy in the world, but their friendship is so real, that their interaction transcends their flaws and we guys cannot not identify with them. Adrian is a shy, nerdy, and not very attractive girl, but she and Rocky formed one of the most romantic cinematic couples who ever shared the screen. Mickey is a grouchy old man but the father-and-son relationship that'll develop between him and Rocky is particularly touching. And last but not least, Apollo who started as an arrogant show- man, very patronizing with Rocky, ended up respecting him. The relationships in ""Rocky"" make the movie works emotionally with a believable sincerity. The story is driven by a very simple plot where characters progressively grow on you. We feel for them and we feel for Rocky who's the soul of the film.<br/><br/>""Rocky"" gives the average viewer a character to identify with -not an anti-hero à la Travis Bickle whose extreme acts might inspire some nut-cases, no- we have here an ordinary hero, a la George Bailey, who challenges his world in the ring. And that's what makes ""Rocky"" the greatest sports movie ever made. The movie defines Sport. Sport is the greatest medium 'little guys' can still use to express themselves, to defy the big guys. In sport, no races, no classes, strength is in the heart. Sport is the revenge of the poor, the misfit, the dumb, who sometimes prove that there's kind of wise nobility in the physical effort that all the intelligence of the world can not reach. It's about strength, it's about passion, it's about HEART, and ""Rocky"" has heart. And maybe that explains why it is one of the most eloquently criticized movies, as if ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Network"" ignited the disdain towards ""Rocky"" twisting the meaning of such beautiful words like honesty, dignity, and humility into its most cynical interpretation : naivety.<br/><br/>But simply because ""Rocky"" doesn't fill your heart with anger and frustration doesn't make it a naive movie, it's easier to destroy and harder to build, and to build the determination and self-confidence of millions of people all over the world is an extraordinary achievement. And the inspiration comes from this vision of a man who goes through patience, pain and humiliations, and who gets hit so many times without falling that there is something very heroic in the ugliness of his face, as if it was carrying the mark of the nastiness of a world which won't give you what you want if you don't come to fight for it. Yes, ""Rocky"" is about fighting, fighting the adversity for which the iconic steps represent the most powerful allegory, fighting your own demons, fighting your weaknesses, not fighting with bravery, but fighting despite the fear, fighting at the risk of losing everything except your most precious asset : dignity and winning nothing except your most precious conquest : respect.<br/><br/>And before you call ""Rocky"" cliché or naive, don't forget it's also a movie about a guy named Stallone, who was like a 'Rocky' in show business who wanted to make a movie about a guy who couldn't never have his break, and finally got the chance of his life, the chance to prove he wasn't a bum  Sly wanted to make this film, and (Yo Adrian!) he did it, and in a few months it was the highest grossing movie of the year, and grabbed the Best Picture Oscar. It's one of the most famous and fascinating box-office success stories, and more than that, it's an inspiration for all the average guys to believe in themselves and to go the distance. Rocky was a million-to-one shot, so was ""Rocky""."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","0","0","3 October 2010"," A sensationally inspiring and well-acted melodrama that set standards that are still followed today but seldom with the same emotional grandeur
","The New York Times critic Vincent Canby dismissed ""Rocky"" as being ""pure 30s make-believe"" and being the intelligent, knowing critic that he was, he had a solid point in his review. I don't think there's a single person who has seen ""Rocky"" whether or not they enjoy it who would disagree with him. I don't even think the movie's makers, including writer/star Sylvester Stallone would strongly argue against that. It is sort of an old-fashioned tale about the underdog trying to become somebody in a moment that is really a scandalous motive for publicity. But as much as I admire and will always admire Mr. Canby as a critic and thinking man, I cannot agree with his overall verdict of ""Rocky."" Sure it isn't exactly fresh material in terms of its plot, but I think it is more than fresh (even today) in the way that it unfolds itself.<br/><br/>""Rocky,"" which has five sequels and countless wanna-bes, set the standards for the underdog story which even today is still being followed almost religiously. You can even see references in Clint Eastwood's daringly different boxing saga ""Million Dollar Baby"" a film which is only slightly better than this one. Sylvester Stallone plays the titular character of Rocky: a goodhearted and world-wary boxer who is down-on-his-luck. He's got a talent, but no opportunity. That is until the world champion (Carl Weathers) needs a brand new opponent for his upcoming match. If his contender can beat him, he gains instant fame as the new world champion.<br/><br/>But there's more depth and more character involved in this story. ""Rocky"" is described as a Cinderella story and not only is it about hope for change and eventual success, but it's a sweet little love story too. Rocky's freshly-written romance is to a shy petshop cashier played by Talia Shire. He's also got an on-and-off friendship with her persistent brother (Burt Young) and a cantankerous old pro (Burgess Meredith). The movie's themes about striving for success also unfold when the depths of these characters are explored. Some of them are almost like leeches; they want to suck off of Rocky's moments of fame, even if he is destined to lose the match.<br/><br/>The movie really rests on the performance, however, by Sylvester Stallone and he never makes a wrong gesture. It's one of his two or three best roles in his career and if you ignore some dicey movies in the 80s and 90s, that's quite a showcase. Mr. Stallone plays his character sort of like a Rodney Dangerfield impersonation. He goes for laughs, as the character is oftentimes trying to entertain other characters with cheap jokes. His antics often fall flat for Talia Shire, but draws a broad grin upon the faces of the audience. Roger Ebert compared Stallone's performance to the early works by Marlon Brando and I think it's a performance that is just as memorable as those, and even the immortalizing ones that Brando did later on films such as ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" In other words, yes, I agree with Mr. Ebert.<br/><br/>But it *is* a movie about boxing...right? Well, that's just the excuse. That's the setup. A friend of mine once said that when he first saw ""Rocky"" as a boy, he hated it because he wanted to see the fights and couldn't have cared less about the love story or the relationships between the characters. Of course now as an adult, his opinion has vastly changed, but let's address the boxing scenes. They do work. In fact, they are very well-choreographed. I really appreciate how director John G. Avildsen avoided clichés such as slow-motion and rotating shots. He set up many angles, like a television match, and filmed the scenes like that. Mr. Avildsen's directing is especially effective here and is more than competently done throughout.<br/><br/>Many have tried to be what ""Rocky"" has become and most have failed. But it's not a shocker to most that this film has become the subject of such praise and imitation. It does have a very unique charm in its otherwise familiar setup and plot that allows it to work wonders on the audience's emotions. ""Rocky"" is one of the two or three best sports dramas I've ever seen and one incredibly entertaining motion picture. I've seen it many times and look forward the many times I will watch it again in the future."

","Rocky is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion. People may not agree due to it introducing Sylvester Stallone, but those who think that are wrong.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone writes and stars as a small time boxer called Rocky Balboa. Even though he has a tough physique he has an innocent heart. He tries to win the heart of the shy, local pet shop clerk Adrian played by Talia Shire and win the respect of his trainer Mickey played by Burgess Meredith. Then when the current heavyweight champion Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers comes into town and wants to fight a unknown boxer. He chooses Rocky(simply because of his boxing name the Italian Stallian). Rocky decides to train and fight Creed. Even though people might not have expected this but Rocky received many academy award nominations including Sylvester Stallone being nominated as actor and writer. Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith and Burt Young(as Adrian's bitter brother Paulie)and it won best picture and best director for John Advilson.

","Rocky defines for me everything that film should be about, the plot is simple but engaging, it is well filmed; it mixes action, drama, romance and comedy perfectly, and the acting although not spectacular is good.<br/><br/>In this film Sylvester Stallone shows not only his talented acting, but also his writing skills, some of the dialogue in this film is fantastically well written.<br/><br/>The movie is probably not the first, but the oldest 'zero to hero' genre that I have seen and so I believe that this defines that genre and elements of Rocky can be seen in major films every day, most particularly the use of montage. The montage is Rocky ending with him celebrating at the top of the steps is one of the most famous scenes in film and if you ask 100 people to name a film with a montage in probably 90 of them would say Rocky with the other 10 mentioning Team America.<br/><br/>From the outset of the film when Rocky is fighting Spider, it was clear to me that I was in for an epic film experience and I was not disappointed, the troubled life of Rocky mixed with his love for the shy Adrian and want to win the fight. Captivated me for two hours and nothing could have stopped me watching until the end.<br/><br/>As for the ending I think it is good that Rocky does not win as it shows that being a hero does not necessarily mean winning but trying your hardest and doing yourself proud.<br/><br/>So whilst I will say that this is not one of my favourite films, it is definitely a fantastic piece of cinema which everyone should view at least once in their lives as it is inspirational.<br/><br/>8/10"

He collects money from people and beats them up and gives the money to a loan shark named Gazzo. He has a good friend named Paulie (Burt young) who drinks a lot and they both have nobody but each other.

The fighter claims to have broken his right hand or something.<br/><br/>So Apollo has to find another fighter to fight and he chooses rocky balboa because he thinks the sound of it sounds like a monster movie and it would make Apollo look good and Apollo plans on finishing him in 2 rounds. Rocky on the other hand acceptes the challenge and then starts getting trained by Mickey. From then on Rocky starts training like crazy and creates his own style of training and this includes punching meat, drinking raw eggs and tieing a string to his feet so he can learn to balance. But yeah all in all this movie is of pure brilliance and the character of rocky has become an icon everywhere. The acting, the music by Bill conti, Rocky and Adrian's relationship, the training and the big fight at the end makes this movie a classic.<br/><br/>This movie is about more than just fighting it's also about the character of Rocky trying to prove himself and to show everyone that he doesn't care about winning and he just wants to go the distance and say he did it. It's about Rocky overcoming all odds and that you don't really have to win to win. After fighting the most dangerous fighter and going the distance and showing everyone that you have the guts and determination and heart you have won something that is bigger than a belt. 10/10"

","""Rocky"" is perhaps the definitive boxing movie. Sure, ""Raging Bull"" seems like the most obvious candidate but the boxing aspect in that film ultimately seems secondary to the interpersonal drama. As far as boxing movies go (or sports movies in general, for that matter) ""Rocky"" is a legitimate contender for the top spot.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Rocky Balboa, a small time boxer who gets a once in a lifetime opportunity to face the heavyweight champ. The odds are stacked against him but he's committed to do what it takes to go the distance.<br/><br/>""Rocky"" was Sylvester Stallone's brainchild. He wrote the screenplay and he also ended up playing the title character. In the end, he was rewarded with Oscar nominations in both capacities. But he didn't do it alone.<br/><br/>The cast is a strong one. As mentioned, Sly nabbed an Oscar nomination but so did castmates Burgess Meredith, Burt Young & Talia Shire. While none of them walked away with an Oscar their nominations were all well deserved. And let's not forget Carl Weathers as Rocky's opponent, the flamboyant champ Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>I admit that I was genuinely surprised by the quality of Sly's writing. The characterization is solid and the storyline nicely balances sports and romance. Perhaps most importantly, the script has the feel of authenticity. Throw in John G. Avildsen's Oscar-winning direction & the iconic Oscar-nominated song ""Gonna Fly Now"" and you've got an impressive combination of elements. So impressive, it turns out, that the film landed the Best Picture Oscar among some heady competition.<br/><br/>I haven't seen any of the film's sequels and I probably never will since the IMDb user ratings seem to suggest a steady decline in quality. Nevertheless, regardless of what has followed for Stallone, the original ""Rocky"" still stands as a classic."

","Rocky Balboa played by Sylvester Stallone, was a small town boxer from Philadelphia, who got the chance of a lifetime. Apollo Creed, (Carl Weathers) a heavy weight champion wanted to fight a no one and he decided he wanted to fight Rocky Balboa. During Rocky's training he fell in love with Adrian Pennino, (Talia Shire) a young woman, who worked at the local pet store. Adrian had a brother named Paulie Pennino, (Burt Young) who was Rocky's friend and was happy for the two of them, that they found each other. During this time Rocky was making money as a debt collector for a loan shark. All he needed was a chance to win that one fight, to make him someone. <br/><br/>This film was released in 1976 and when you view it you can tell by the costumes they wear. Everyone wore clothing that wasn't bright and flashy; it was dull and not at all fashionable. At the end of the film when they done the makeup on Rocky and Apollo; from the swollen eye to the blood running down their face, they did is so well it looked real. <br/><br/>Mickey (Joe Spinell) who was Rocky's ex-trainer told Rocky he just needed to retire and that he was a bum. Rocky was determined to show everyone he was able to do it. Mickey said he would be his trainer, but Rocky was still leery of losing to Apollo. This film has the same theme as the film, ""The Replacements"". You take a bunch of football players who are nobody's and everyone told them that they couldn't do it; then they came back and showed everyone they could. The music in this film was wonderful and it made the film a legend. When Rocky was training and he ran up the stairs, put his arms in the air, at that point he felt as though he was on top the world; and no one could defeat him. <br/><br/>This film is a prime example of what you can accomplish, if you set your mind to it. Rocky wanted Adrian to fall in love with him and she did. He wanted to win the fight against Apollo and he did. That's why this film won 3 Oscars, 15 other awards and was nominated for 19 others. Even if you're someone who has no money, you can still be someone. Whether you're a boxer, football player or just being yourself; you're somebody and you can accomplish anything you set your mind to."
"misassistant","10","0","0","1 May 2010"," The perfect movie that originally came out at the perfect time
","First, allow me to bat aside the cynics who now disparage this masterpiece of a movie by pointing out that - in the full context of the time in the U.S. when it was released - this was exactly the kind of movie we immediately were ready to fall in love with. Rewind back to 1976, post-Watergate, the Arab oil embargo, deep recession, the Soviet Union on the march, and the era that saw the invention of the terms ""malaise,"" ""misery index,"" and ""stagflation."" To make matters worse, all this economic and foreign policy decline was occurring on the bicentennial of our nation's founding. Along comes a movie about a lowly amateur boxer who earns just enough to pay for his hovel of a Philadelphia apartment as a ""collection agent"" for a loan-shark, using his menacing size as the ""penalty"" for debtors slow to pay back their loans and gigantic interest. Yes, it's the classic underdog story, and yet Stallone - who both wrote the script and played the starring role - and director John Aldiss somehow managed to craft a movie that allows the audience to fall into believing the story and cheering enthusiastically to the end. Incredibly, they managed to produce this movie for a grand total of one million dollars, a shoestring budget by even the standards of the time, and somehow that only added to the realism. This movie also saw - for the first time in a major film - the use of a brand new technological innovation: the Steadycam That particular innovation greatly enhanced the illusion that the audience is literally running alongside Stallone as he runs through the seedy neighborhoods of Philadelphia, getting in shape for the big fight with the Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed. It turns out that the set they used for Stallone's apartment was not really a set at all, but in fact a genuinely shabby hole. There is litter in the streets, too, and that only enhances the point that this is a real nobody trying to show that he can be a somebody. There is also a love interest in this movie, played perfectly by Talia Shire as Adrian. When Stallone first sees her, she is a dowdy young woman wearing hideous cat lady glasses, frumpy clothes, and (worst of all) a gray wool watch cap. She is also extremely shy and reluctant to respond to Rocky's affections. Somehow Rocky sees through through all that, and (later) also shows that Adrian is in fact a strikingly beautiful woman. As Rocky courts Adrian, Heavyweight Champ Apollo Creed (played brilliantly by Carl Weathers) is growing bored with the routine nature of selecting his next challenger. Creed takes the daring (and very smart) move of deciding to do something radical by offering an unknown the chance to fight him for a shot at the title. Creed knows that this will only draw more fans because of its unusual nature, plus he is cocky enough to believe that the challenger will be a cinch to defeat. Rocky at first does not want to do this, since he senses what is really going on, plus he also realizes that he is being used as a prop for a kind of publicity stunt. However, he also realizes what this would mean for him, and retired trainer Mickey (the role of a lifetime from the great Burgess Meredith) talks him into it, with himself as the trainer. Mickey himself had boxed quite a bit in his youth, never quite reaching the big time, and he sees in Rocky the opportunity for both of them to reach it. The story progresses from there, Rocky at first in agony as he struggles to run even a short distance, the Bill Conti soundtrack expertly conveying the lonely pain of an out of shape contender. Later, under Mickey's instruction and with confidence building, the soundtrack becomes upbeat with the now familiar ""Gonna Fly Now"" propelling it along. As all this happens, it really is hard to remember that this is only a movie, and the final ten minutes are some of the finest in movie history. I will not spoil this for those who have never seen it, except to say that the ending is absolutely perfect, and I am unembarrassed to admit that even now I get a bit misty when I see it. Again, getting back to the context of the time that this movie was released, I suspect that if this movie had come out in 1996 instead of 1976, it might not have gained the iconic status it now enjoys. Yes, it's true, the story of Rocky nicely mirrors that of America as a whole, and that makes it all the more appealing. And I don't care if I get derided as some kind of flag waver for having written that. If you have not had the chance to see this movie, you owe it to yourself to grab a copy and watch. Another point that should be mentioned is that this is neither a guy flick nor a chick flick, but instead a perfect blend. It's terrific to watch alone, as a couple, or a whole crowd. Trust me, you won't regret it!"

","I have to say, the IMDb rating for this movie is perfect. An 8.0 describes what Rocky is: a fairly great movie and completely deserving of its place as one of the top 250 movies of all time.<br/><br/>While I don't believe it to be the best in the series (Rocky Balboa is just above this), it did start it all and is such a great romance movie. It's not only romance in a physical sense, but romance in terms of what it does for the sport of boxing.<br/><br/>Rocky's a fighter in every regard, and he's played (and written) very well by Stallone. Talia Shire is also memorable in her role as Adrian (my word isn't she beautiful?) and you can't help but smile anytime Burt Young (playing Paulie) is on-screen, despite his horrible deeds.<br/><br/>Mickey's visit to Rocky's flat demonstrates Burgess Meredith's supreme acting skills; he and Stallone make a great, and unlikely, acting team. Finally, Carl Weathers is often forgotten but here he puts in a fine performance as Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>While it is a bit slow and showing its age now, Rocky is all heart. The only thing that could put first-time watchers off here would be the hype behind the character of Rocky, as they will no doubt find themselves confused by what they've heard and what they're seeing. But please do give him time to win you over. It's inevitable he will. 8/10"

"dnzl-jns","Null","0","0","29 July 2009"," ""Cut Me Mick""
","""Cut Me Mick!"" The year was 1976 when Sylvester Stalone wrote Rocky. This film was directed John G. Avildsen. This film went on to win the best picture award at the Oscars that year and was turned into an instant classic. This film teaches the important life lesson of never selling yourself short. If you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything. Stalone plays Rocky Balboa, a street brawler turned legitimate fighter, in Philadelphia. Balboa was working for a local thug, breaking thumbs and collecting money, when then current champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) looked up Balboa and offered him a shot at the title. Creed was looking for a pushover fight. He scoured the bottom of the lists of fighters for an eligible fighter that he knew he could easily defeat. Creed had lost his ""eye of the tiger"" and was no longer hungry. So when the champ selected the Italian Stallion, the pushover from Philadelphia, he did not know what he was getting himself into. Balboa, reluctantly, accepted the bout knowing he did not possess the skills necessary to become the heavy weight champ but did so because he did not have anything to lose. Balboa finds out what he has inside himself during his rigorous training regimen. He decides that he is going to get into the ring and give it his all. He knew that if he did that he would have no regrets. He knew that no one expected him to make it out of the first round but was going to try anyway. Balboa not only finds himself but finds romance where he least expects to find it. His long time friend Paulie (Burt Young) had a sister named Adrian (Talia Shire) who Balboa fell in love with. Balboa had to try and try again to get in good with Adrian. Just like the upcoming fight, Balboa, had to put his heart and soul into winning over his future wife. Balboa has to overcome mountains as obstacles. He does so with an inner strength that most men only wish they had. This film is an inspirational film that teaches life lessons that need to be learned by all."

","Spoilers I assume you saw this movie. The movie Rocky is about a down and out boxer in Philadelphia that gets a shot at the heavyweight boxing championship of the world and goes the distance with the Champ Appollo Creed, who no one ever went the distance with. At the same time it has a romance story between Rocky and his friends sister Adreinne.<br/><br/>The movie Rocky was the first to display the formula that many other movies followed to success. It used stark realism and a ""not so Hollywood"" result of losing the final fight, combined with the irony of Rocky wining his first fight a being considered a bum, topped off with inspirational music to bring the audience a realistic feeling of triumph of the human spirit. The movie is more successful than the many movies that followed it including all of the 5 Rocky sequels. Why? Well many have wondered about that. I have often thought about writing a fight club for women. I came up with a movie and guess what, it is really a rehashing of part of this story, revolving around someone like Adriene. The super success and critical accaim of this masterpiece lies in the fact that we have a movie of two characters being transformed by love, Rocky and Adrienne. This transformation is choreographed to great music. <br/><br/>Stallone was a down and out actor pitching a movie about a wrestler called ""Paradise Alley"", which no one wanted to make, when he as a second thought, pitched this movie to Hollywood execs. Stallone had not been remembered for his role in the Lords of Flatbush and he did not have much of a reputation at all.<br/><br/>He broke through with Rocky because it had tremendous supporting performances from Talia Shire, and Burt Young, not to mention Burgess Meredith, who I always thought of as the Penquin from the Batman TV Show, until I saw his great performance in this movie. <br/><br/>He also got a tremendous effort from Bill Conti who wrote the music. I read Stallone's original script, and I believe, the Director Mr. Alvidsen also did a great job editing the movie to the music. He also cut a lot of less meaningful scenes out of the end of the movie, to enable the music to overwhelm the audience in the end. (If you listen to the movie, the music is almost non-existent in the beginning and the music is more complex orchestrated and in every scene by the end) <br/><br/>Talia Shire played Adrian the shy sister of Pauley, Rocky's best friend. As such, she had to show us she was shy, which is very hard to do on screen. She shows through fleeting glances at Rocky that Adrian has an interest in Rocky that she can not bring herself to show outwardly. She also brings out an underlying intensity when arguing with her brother, showing that when shy little Adrian is passionate, she can really gets her point across.<br/><br/>After the big fight with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Adrian also charges through thousands of people when Rocky calls her at the end of the movie, which in miniature, became the formula for romantic comedies after this movie. Two people separated by obstacles come closer and closer until they finally get past all of the obstacles and get together.<br/><br/>The music of Rocky was awesome and inspirational. I especially liked the song ""Going The Distance"", which played during the big ending fight from Round 3 to round 14, when Rocky is taking the beating and hanging in. It is the most inspirational song in the Rocky movies. I also liked the song ""You Take My Heart Away"", which plays during the romantic scene when Rocky takes Adrian's hat and glasses off of her and reveals the real Adrian for the beauty she is. <br/><br/>In all a very ground breaking movie and rightfully it has been copied numerous times but never equaled."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","0","11 April 2009"," Unashamed underdog story about an everyday man destined to get his chance.
","Is Rocky really a 'sports movie'? You might see it that way because it's one of those films that boils down to a showdown – of the sporting variety, in which the man of the hour Rocky Balboa fights high-prize fighter and king of the boxing world Apollo Creed for the right to be the best. But getting there is the joy in Rocky; getting there is not about sports but about life, companionship, living, just generally surviving less than pleasant conditions but most importantly: belief, the belief and eternal optimism that something good might well lurk around the corner. Sure, Rocky boxes but it's a hobby, a hobby that he can't really nail for whatever financial or lack-of-skills reason. But what the film is, is a rising through the ranks of life; a look at an individual whom nobody would usually batter five-seconds worth of an eyelid to, and his rise to a chance at something.<br/><br/>By the time the fight has finished, the filmmakers have chopped about so much and got across such a feeling of awe that it doesn't matter to us, nor the characters, who wins or what's going on. What is for 80% of the time a slow burning and very intriguing character study of people, shot on and around the streets of Philadelphia, suddenly becomes a frantic and quite deliberately messy blur of fists and hard bodies slugging it out in an indoor arena housing thousands. But it's a deliberate tactic, to throw aside all the realism and long takes of human beings engaging in human activity and sharing human emotions, and replace it with chaotic fighting to the point we may have to just glance away.<br/><br/>There is a scene during which Rocky, played by Sylvester Stallone, is talking to a bartender about life. It captures the hypothesis of the film as dialogue about 'everybody gets their chance' and that 'there is always a moment when a nobody gets the chance to be a somebody' is played out. The film begins with a boxing match, a match that Rocky wins, but what follows are several scenes revolving around day-to-day life as it is revealed Rocky is nothing more than a money collector for a local criminal. The film deconstructs the idea of a boxer and does so through Rocky, a person that uses his fists to earn money but is a delicate, modest person whom you'd be hard pressed immediately label 'bad'.<br/><br/>This notion is done so through the slightest of subtle hints to actual events and interactions with other characters. At one point, Rocky opts against breaking the thumb of a man who owes money to Rocky's employer on the basis of pity, but maybe we're not convinced this is anything special on Rocky's behalf. At other times, he bosses a delicate situation with a naive girl following a date that shouldn't have been but does so in a careful enough manner, suggesting and promising there's more to him than his boxing and crime-led line of work. Additionally, he keeps pet turtles, which he bought at the pet store said girl, named Adrianna (Shire), works. He takes care of them and they are delicate – going so far as to get their bowl and furniture just right so they don't feel uncomfortable as pets. Eventually, it is the audience seduced into liking him, and from whence comes the overwhelming fondness for the character.<br/><br/>Rocky has a friend named Paulie (Young), who is a butcher of sorts, and doubles up as Adrianna's brother. He carries a certain aggressiveness to him, a character working along-side the protagonist but not as a foil so much as a visual representation of incorrect or 'wrong' beliefs. Rocky's attitude and spoken tone is conflicted to that of Paulie's outgoing, loud and aggressive attributes. In fact, so much of the film is this grounded and realistic look at everyday people doing everyday things that the film needs to pull a proverbial rabbit out of the hat to bring together Rocky and his destiny that is this championship fight. The event that acts as the catalyst is Creed's opponent pulling out of the scheduled fight and Creed himself handpicking 'The Italian Stallion' that is Rocky Balboa to fill in; on America's Day of Independence; which Creed sees as a would-be walkover victory, something that'll only confirm his superiority.<br/><br/>But there's the first mistake, something that the audience themselves may well have been roped into making in the first place, and that's underestimation. The film highlights the arrogance supposedly superior forces have over their smaller opponents, a brushing aside of something deemed inferior or not immediately assumed to be 'of the standard'. If the film is an underdog story, then it has no shame in recognising itself as such. At one point, Rocky employs the help of Mickey Goldmill (Meredith), an ex-boxer from another generation, as a coach or 'mentor' to get him ready for the fight and seeds of doubt are planted within Creed's head when a TV interview shows Rocky as someone who perhaps means business. The film is completely unashamed in labelling Mickey as a mentor.<br/><br/>The film captures how we feel about the fight perfectly. The result is not important. If the film had been primarily a boxing film, the fight would've meant more to its characters than usual and the film peels off for its look at romance just as much as it does its social commentary on the quality of living, in a place and at a time. The film lends more time to the development of Adrianna and Rocky as well as Rocky's getting by in life more than it does boxing and training for boxing, thus we (as do the characters) care more for the result of that romance than any boxing result. The film deserves the praise and attention its garnered."

","Rocky is a start to one of the greatest movie series ever in my opinion. While all of the films (except Rocky 5) are very good, the first Rocky film stands above all of them as the best of the series.<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa is a boxer who also collects money. He is living in the slums of Philadelphia and is not really achieving what he should be. As luck would have it the heavyweight champion of the world selects Rocky as his next opponent due to the fact that he wants to fight an Italian on independence day in Philadelphia. This opportunity leads to Rocky starting to try to achieve things that he never dreamed of before.<br/><br/>Often people refer to Rocky as a boxing film but it is so much more. THe acting in this film is great and so is the tone. There are a lot of scenes where characters are silent and reflecting on things that the audience easily can tell. Like how in the beginning Rocky is looking at himself in the mirror as if to say ""what happened to me?"".<br/><br/>The interaction between characters is awesome. Stallone does an awesome job as ROcky and this is his best performance in a film. How he did not win best actor is beyond absurd. THis is acting at its best. Rocky first meets adrian in this film and this is where the relationship starts. Also awesome in this film is Paulie, Adrians brother. The character of Paulie is very important because it shows the side of envy and disappointment that many people relate too.<br/><br/>While a few of the later films in the Rocky series are action flicks, this one is drama. THere is a lot of training and a great boxing match at the end but the story really is about Rocky and his relationship with several other characters like Paulie, Adrian, and Mickey. This film does an awesome job of developing characters which helps make the series endure for so long.<br/><br/>WHo can resist an underdog story? Rocky working hard in this film is awesome. THe ""Gonna fly now"" song is awesome as Rocky is training. THis is easily one of the most motivational films I have ever seen. Just thinking about Rocky training in this film makes me think that I can achieve anything.<br/><br/>The boxing match at the end of this film is epic. Nothing quite measures up to it due to how it is set up. THe guy who has no business being in the ring with the heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky holding his own against Creed is spectacular.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other emotional scenes but I do not want to give too much away. ALl I can do is recommend this film to everyone."

","This is the ultimate underdog movie. I don't know what makes Rocky Balboa so sympathetic apart from the obvious contrast with the big bad opponent, but get this, I think it's Stallone's acting. Some people see him as a hormone-enhanced bodybuilder stereotype who just happened to be around when they needed someone tough. Those people are entitled to their measly, inferior, wrong opinions, but Stallone has got talent. Even if you don't take into account that he wrote the screenplay, hey what the hell I will take that into account. This is a solid screenplay. There are just so many good ideas in there. Balboa is just a great anti-hero. He was milked a lot over the years, but somehow always managed to keep his dignity. Furthermore, there's a great joy in seeing Rocky running around places accompanied by flocks of cheering bystanders. It's the cheesiest thing, but you can sense the euphoria. And let's not forget the undying ""Rocky"" theme. Everything about this movie is just so awesome."

","What a nice fairy tale, and most of it due to the writer and star, Sylvester Stallone, aided by director John Avildsen. Stallone is a low-life, well-intentioned young guy who breaks thumbs for the Mafia and makes a few dollars fighting in shabby clubs. He can't even get it on with the homely Talia Shire. Part of the problem is hers in that she's pathologically shy. She lives with her brother, Burt Young, who abuses her, calls her a ""loser"". Finally a drunken Young throws her out. She moves in with Stallone. Two of life's losers, you might say, but otherwise things are at a stalemate.<br/><br/>Into this static scene, like the Good Witch of the West, comes the heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, who picks Stallone's name out of a hat for his next bout. ""The land of opportunity,"" says Weathers, rubbing his hands gleefully over the prospect of pounding the crap out of a white guy in Philadelphia.<br/><br/>Now Stallone must get into the ring with this arrogant monster and the odds in Vegas give him no more than three rounds out of fifteen. So he gets up at 4 AM, drinks half a dozen raw eggs, puts on his sweats, and runs and runs and runs, huffing and puffing, through the garbage-strewn streets of dawn. The rough-hewn guy who owns the local gym, Burgess Meredith, adopts him and becomes his manager.<br/><br/>The night of the heavyweight championship bout arrives and guess what? Stallone doesn't get knocked out in the third round. Instead, he steps out of his corner in the FIRST round, Weathers taps him politely on the chin, and Stallone slumps to the floor dead. Just kidding.<br/><br/>Actually, after fifteen rounds of brutal battle, with Weathers' rib broken and Stallone's face simulating the recovery phase of a major face lift, Weathers has won on points but barely. Stallone has achieved his goal, which was to ""go the distance,"" to give it his ""best shot."" On first viewing I thought the ending was perfectly constructed. No thirty-year-old slum bum could train for a couple of weeks and win the championship from a skilled and powerful boxer, no matter how big his heart. But he COULD go the distance. Alas, the ending has Rocky losing the fight, regaining his self esteem, marrying the now rather fetching babe, and winning $150,000 -- but it was all commercially oriented. The fight HAD to end as it did, not for dramatic purposes, but so that the inevitable sequel could follow, and the sequels to the sequels, and so on ad infinitum. It wasn't about self respect or love at all. It was just about money.<br/><br/>That ending turned out to be a crashing disappointment but in the context of the first Rocky film it works flawlessly. So does the rest of the script. Stallone is quite good as the inarticulate hoodlum, constantly hunching his shoulders and shadow boxing along the sidewalks. He's like Terry Malloy in ""On the Waterfront"".<br/><br/>Don't want to run out of space here, so let me mention a weakness or two. Unlike the Rocky character, it's obvious that Sylvester Stallone doesn't lack much in the way of self esteem. His pheromones are so powerful that he scores with his girl on their first date. He hardly ever passes up a chance to strip off and exhibit his bulky muscles. He climbs out of bed on the first morning of his regimen wearing a grimy sweatshirt that matches his other outfits, and -- you should see this apartment. It looks worse than MINE. Junk all over the place. Two turtles (""Cuff"" and ""Link"" -- cute, eh?) in their aquarium. Naked light bulbs. But he gives us a glimpse of his skivvies -- blue Gucci Pucci nylon briefs that barely conceal his genitals. Stallone hands us his genitalia all the time, in this and other films. (He starred in a skin flick once, so it is said.) Rocky refuses to ""fool around"" with his girl while in training because he has to remain ""strong."" In other words, sperm equals strength, and women drain you of it. What the hell is this -- folk physiology or psychosis? I ask because another Rocky had the same conviction in ""Raging Bull"" and because the insane General Jack D. Ripper also believed it in ""Dr. Strangelove."" It must have involved a monstrous effort on Stallone's part to disguise such a phenomenal ego.<br/><br/>I thought there was something of a problem with the racism too. Apollo Creed (whose name whisks me back in time to Catechism and memorizing the prayer The Apostle's Creed) is a thorough dufus, given to snapping out orders to underlings, like, ""Make sure you fly my barber to Philadelphia."" When he chooses to fight a white man, the promoter says, ""It's a very American thing to do."" ""No,"" says Weathers, ""it's a smart thing."" He's an egotistical fool, and not an endearing one either. Just a fool.<br/><br/>Now I've gotten the bad stuff out of the way. The bad stuff would become badder as the series wore on and lead finally to the self glorification of Rocky XXI. But that doesn't detract from the charm of just plain ""Rocky."" It's a fairy tale but an uplifting one, written with insight into the characters, a perceptive performance by Stallone, and expert direction. When Stallone first invites the bashful Shire upstairs to his room, he enters the doorway alone. She's standing at the bottom of the stairs looking up doubtfully. And we see his hand emerge from the flat and hold the door open invitingly. And there's a scene in which Stallone and Meredith must first argue heatedly and then agree to a partnership. The reconciliation is in long shot and we don't hear any dialog. We only see the two finally shake hands, evidence of a director's delicate touch."

","Once you've watched rocky your life will never be the same.i can tell you by personal experience that my life changed completely.<br/><br/>Rocky is more than just a boxing movie. Rocky is about going after your dreams when the opportunity arises. Everyone can relate to being the underdog, to being the down and out guy without a chance of actually being the one to come out on top. Rocky Balboa uses boxing as a metaphor to just capitalize on the great opportunities that come by in life.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes that I feel makes Rocky so special is the night before the fight. Rocky wonders around the stadium, and then goes back home to Adrian to say ""he can't beat him."" This is a moment where Rocky sort of admits defeat; it's a gripping, captivating scene that displays the more gritty realism of Rocky. Everyone from time to time has those moments of doubt, where they realize that it just ain't realistic and feasible. This shows the depth and character of Rocky, almost as if he has sort of been broken down. At this time, Rocky just decides that ""All he wants to do is go the distance. Nobodies ever gone the distance with Creed, and if the bell rings and I'm still standing... maybe I'll realize I wasn't just another bum for the neighborhood."" This scene is so pivotal in marking a fairy-tale movie like Rocky so much more gritty and realistic. <br/><br/>Rocky is just such a magical, emotional, powerful film. You feel like your in it with Rocky, and during the fight scene your standing up screaming for Rocky. It's such an incredible experience. It's sentimentalism at its best. The acting is terrific all across the board. Burgess Meredith is perfect as Rocky's trainer. Talia Shire is great as the love interest. And .........

","""SPOILERS""<br/><br/>This film, which was surprisingly written by Sly, has been a cultural phenomenon for the past 30 years. It's no wonder why either. This film is beautifully crafted and adds humor, emotion and action to what can called one of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>The reason why Rocky is so effective is that it really defines the American Dream. The underdog, the unknown, who nobody believes in, he doesn't believe in himself, goes through tremendous obstacles and training to take on the ""Ali-esque ""Apollo Creed for the most coveted title in the world.<br/><br/>With colorful characters such as boxing trainer ""Mick"" played by Burgess Meredith and local drunkard and meat packer ""Paulie"" portrayed by Burt Young (though I doubt he was really acting), Rocky showcases an extraordinary ability to bring likeness and realism to these characters which really helps bring the viewer into the film. Not to mention a standout performance by Talia Shire, who beautifully plays ""Adrian"", Rocky's ""pet shop dame"".<br/><br/>The film follows the storyline of Rocky (Stallone), a leg-breaking loan shark working for mob boss Tony Gazzo. On the side, Rocky fights less than stellar combatants inside a dusty old Philadelphia church for low pay. On his route home, Rocky always finds the time to stop into the local pet shop and tell a humorous joke to the shy store clerk Adrian to whom he is very infatuated with. After losing his locker at Mighty Micks Gymnasium and humiliating tongue lashing from Mick, Rocky feels like he's a no good bum. But then the boisterous, self-promoting and legendary showman boxing champ Apollo Creed gives a Rocky a life changing opportunity. A shot at the champ. Rocky, at first reluctant to accept, decides to go it alone against the ""Master Of Disaster"". But after a tear-jerking conversation with Mick, Rocky enlists the help of his former grizzled trainer and decides to put his heart and dedication into the upcoming bout. As his romance blossoms with Adrian, especially after a memorable after Thanksgiving date, which is just ""Thursday"" to Rocky, the Italian Stallion realizes there's more at stake than just the belt. After adrenaline inducing training scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat accompanied by inspiring music, by genius composer Bill Conti, Rocky is ready for the Main Event. All he wants is to go the distance with Creed, which no fighter can claim to have met that feat, and not just be another ""bum"" from the neighborhood. The final fight scene, in my opinion, was the best in the entire series. Filled with viscous hooks and jaw-breaking uppercuts, it's a sequence of such exhilarating action you cannot take your eyes off it. A case of the brawler vs. the boxer, by far one cinemas best fighting scenes and most climatic endings ever illustrated on the big screen.<br/><br/>Rocky himself is one of the main reasons why this film is so successful. People of any background can appreciate his desire and commitment to be the best. His character traits we can all relate too and gives us an emotional connection with him. He inspires and makes you realize your own potential to ""Go The Distance""."

","This movie is so great there is very little suspension of disbelief to engage in, if any. So well written and acted that it could be passed off as reality . Setting this story in 70's Philadelphia is absolute genius. Some of the set locations are so bleak and hopeless that if I was Rocky I wouldn't even get out of bed no matter how bad the apartment stinks. I wish I had written the scene where he asks Adrian to go to the basketball game. She gives no answer and he immediately changes the subject and acts like it never happened. What guy cannot relate to that? And how can an actress so completely embody nerdiness and hotness in one character? Definitely on the very short list of NO BRAINER great films."

It's also a significant film for the way it was made. Sly Stallone virtually unknown and broke got the inspiration for this when real life and underdog boxer Chuck Wepner had went the distance with the ""Greatest"" Muhammad Ali. Stallone wrote the script on a shoestring budget and it's a real knockout winner and sentimental favorite for many reasons.<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa(Stallone)a fourth rate and tomato can Philadelphia club fighter is a man who's lonely and at 30 even resorts to earning a living as a collector for street thugs on the mean streets of the city of brotherly love.

Plus very memorable and comical is the supporting performance of Adrianna's brother the funny and very rugged looking and rude Paulie(good performance by Burt Young). The best of the supporting cast and maybe one of the best in film history is from legendary Burgess Meredith as Mick the tough and rough but very wise and humble old man. Who after some friction and doubt sees the determination and fire that the Italian Stallion has, so Mick decides to train Rock for a title match against the champ Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers).<br/><br/>For a film that's very cherished and memorable the performances are great, the acting, story and even the musical score is touching the sounds are some of the best in film history.

"Maximus975","Null","0","0","24 November 2008"," Summary
","""Rocky"" is the epitome of movies that have characters who go from a no body to a somebody in an array of genius dialogue, and montages. As the ultimate underdog story, the story features Rocky Balboa as a less than small time boxer in no particular division of any importance getting the chance of a life time to face off against the heavy weight champion of the word. People that knew and did not know Rocky knew he could not stand a chance against Apollo Creed, however Rocky just wanted a chance at the title. Rocky did just that in Sylvester Stallone's writing debut, and as his first acting roll to put him on the radar of Hollywood big shots. The movie itself can make whoever is watching it feel nothing but inspiration at the end when the underdog stays neck and neck with the fiercest fighter in the world of boxing and does not get knocked out once. Although it would appear at some points in the film that Rocky is about to be horribly brutalized by his opponent, the adrenaline begins flowing in both viewers and Rocky himself to go for the win. Supported by a not so star studded list of characters like the studio heads wanted, the likes of Tilia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith add a sense of reality to the gritty streets of the films Philidelphian landscape. If A-List stars were hired for the film and Stallone was just a writer of the script, the film would not be what it is today  A cult classic and inspirational story."

","Thirty-two years ago a character legend named Rocky Balboa was born. A man on his 29th birthday received $200 dollars if I can remember. He spent half on his birthday needs and wants, and he took the rest to see a fight between Wepner and Ali. That man was Sylvester Stallone. That night he went home and wrote the story of his own life, although some sites will tell you otherwise he really based it off his own life. He had taken his picture down to agencies and people turned him down. One time he even erupted throwing furniture around the room because he didn't get the fight. He had had previous movies but they were not successful. He said that if Rocky didn't make any money all hope was lost. Nobody wanted Sly to play Rocky. Stars were looked at such as James Caan and Ryan O'Neal. But Rocky said he would play the part or he wouldn't do it at all. What followed was a movie phenomenon. Sylvester never imagined it would go as well as it did. This movie is perfect if you want a good story. I has a story of gentle, sweet, and wonderful love between Rocky and the shy pet shop Adrian. It has the meaning of getting self-respect by competing for the title of the heavy weight champion of the world and lasting the 15 rounds, thereby going the distance. This is a great family film. Other than the hanky-panky between Rocky and Adrian and the bloody images of Rocky, this movie is great for the young ones. So what are you waiting for? It you haven't already seen this movie, rent it or wait to see it on t.v."

","In watching Rocky I'm reminded that every once in a while a movie comes along that just seems to fit together so perfectly that it seems perfectly natural that someone had to have made exactly that movie at some point. Other times I am pleasantly surprised at how good a movie is, or irritated at how bad, or just amazed that someone would think to make something so bizarre or cheesy. But with Rocky, everything is exactly what it should be, the movie knows exactly where it belongs and exactly what it wants to say, and so it comes across as a perfectly natural piece of storytelling. <br/><br/>The way that Rocky was directed not only indicates skillful direction but also very skillful acting. The film is composed of unusually long takes. There is very little cutting during scenes, which is difficult to do because the actors have to act for such a long time without stopping. This type of cinematography requires much more planning and meticulous rehearsal to get right, and there is much more dialogue for the actors to know all at once. There is something to be said about the actors because they were able to do this and still avoid making the dialogue sound even a little bit rehearsed.<br/><br/>There have been thousands of movies made about an underdog getting the chance of a lifetime and rising to the challenge, but not only is Rocky barely about that fight, it also goes deeper and gives a reason for it. The world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, is planning a fight on the 4th of July that is to be a major, major event. All other professional fighters are booked on other events or, if he says so himself, afraid to fight him. <br/><br/>This necessity inspires Creed to come up with a marketing ploy where he will broadcast an opportunity for an amateur fighter to fight the greatest fighter in the world on America's 200th birthday. <br/><br/>But not just any fighter, it has to be someone significant, someone that will give meaning to the date that the event is to take place, and of course someone who will make Creed look symbolic and meaningful as he's knocking him out. <br/><br/>And what better way to celebrate America's birthday and how far we've come than for a black man to beat an Italian in a major fighting event! (you see, Creed mistakenly believed that Christopher Columbus, an Italian, had discovered America, unaware that Columbus never set foot in North America and thought he was in India anyway, and regardless, the Chinese had landed on American's east coast more than 70 years before Columbus ever set sail!).<br/><br/>But what really wins Rocky's way into our hearts is how regular he is. Like it or not, he's a big, dumb oaf, but he's honest, he's hard-working (his job as a collector for a bookie is not exactly high-brow professionalism, but he knows it's a bum job but he also knows that it's really the only thing he's any good at), he has a genuine love for someone who clearly needs it, and he cares for small animals and there's nothing quite as charming as a huge man who loves his turtles. <br/><br/>Besides that, he believes in himself, even when it seems ludicrous to even consider that he might have a chance against the greatest fighter in the world. <br/><br/>What gives the movie real drama is that to Apollo, the entire fight is just for show, but Rocky doesn't know that. He thinks it's meant to be a real chance for an unknown fighter to challenge the heavyweight champion. Apollo plans to knock him out whenever he's ready, but still that he's doing some kind of humanitarian thing by putting an unknown fighter's name and face up there on that poster next to his own. <br/><br/>The fight between Rocky and Apollo at the end of the film is one of the true classic moments in the history of film-making. It proves that it's not about winning or losing, and it's not even about how you play the game, it's about giving it everything you've got when you have an opportunity. Rocky had a chance to do something that seemed impossible, and he did everything he possibly could do to make it happen. Bravo!"

","I'm not a fan of boxing, so I put off watching this film for a long time as I was under the false impression that that was all that Rocky was about - boxing. How very wrong I was. Although boxing is one of the main story lines in the movie, it is definitely not the only one, with many other story arcs, themes, and ideas that were better suited to my interests.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone gives an incredible, unforgettable performance as Rocky Balboa, a small time boxer who is given the chance to fight the heavy weight champion. The character is warm, likable, funny, and Stallone really brings Rocky alive. Talia Shire likewise does a fantastic job as Adrian (Rocky's incredibly shy girlfriend), in fact, I can't think of a single bad performance in the entire film.<br/><br/>There's character development, there's a love story, there's some characters you will love and others who you'll hate. You never feel cheated when watching this film - the script, the acting, the story, the soundtrack, there is not one bad aspect to pick out, but many, many good ones. It's a heart warming, family film that everyone should try and watch at least once."

","I saw this film long time ago so long time ago that I barely remember it so basically watching Rocky just last night was like watching it for the very first time. I had like a prejudice, I considered the Academy Award for best picture of Rocky to be just one of the many jokes that the Academy has made and not particularly funny jokes. Taxi Driver is one of my all time favourites so you can imagine the rest. Now after watching finally Rocky I still believe its Oscar is a big joke however is easy to see why it won and easy to say that the Academy Awards are just a big piece of s***. Before you stop reading my comment I will write that I do like this film and truly a lot. I had a lot of fun by watching this with a couple of friends. It is definitely a film with a lot of memorable stuff that everybody knows, many famous sequences and that music theme. I love how it begins but essentially nothing really happens we just watch Rocky in his daily routine; boxing is just one way to get some dollars but not any more a possible way to have something bigger in life. In short, Rocky is not any more thinking just in boxing, he has to get money of course and he uses his strength for other little jobs for Gazzo (Joe Spineli). On the other hand we meet a present star of boxing, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) but actually we meet him not as the boxer but more as the ""businessman"" that sees beyond the sport. Sure he is the champion and when he sees the chance to be not only a great boxer but also a patriot. He sees the chance to show why America is the land of opportunity and, of course, he don't think twice in order to make a decision. Now he is the Uncle Sam and he will give the opportunity of his life to a working class Italian, American with that Apollo Creed will be the hero, the champion, the spectacle, the star, etc. However he is not a likable character at all mostly because almost we never watch him as the boxer. Of course Rocky is that Italian American, ""the Italian Stallion"" who doesn't even imagine what his nickname will make, yes he will find finally some luck and for sure I won't miss the chance. But it is not just boxing, actually during the entire 120 minutes of the film we only watch a couple of fights of Rocky; is also a love story that is even quite funny. Funny because you watch how people change for love, one day Adrian (Taila Shire) wears glasses and the other day she doesn't need glasses any more! Rocky changed her a lot and on that way he is my f****** idol (first date first kiss and she was an extremely shy girl!). The brother of Adrian (Burt Young) is always following Rocky and always repeating the same things to ""the Italian Stallion"", thanks to that he is another funny character of the film but there are many repetitive dialogs during it that I found extremely fun to watch. Do you know who is Julio Cesar Chavez? Well if you don't he was a great Mexican boxer and recently he worked as commentator of TV for the Olympic boxing. I saw a fight of one Mexican who, unfortunately, was beaten but it was absolute fun hearing Chavez. He said that the Mexican loose the fight because ""no quebro la cintura"" (he doesn't bend at the waist) and the fun thing was that he repeated that like 10 times during the fight! It was really funny and during this film we have some similar situations. The one that made me remember Chavez was the conversation of Rocky with Mickey (Burgess Meredith), he repeats a lot that Rocky will need a trainer. Of course these two will have finally a special friendship and here the real training begins so the memorable sequences begins. A boxer who wanted to make a real fight against the star, he did that but<br/><br/>I like this film a lot but I just don't found in it the masterpiece and inspirational piece of cinema that many found. The first Rocky is a lot of fun with that mentioned memorable stuff. Are you talking to me? Is curious to hear Rocky saying that. Anyway, watch it friends.<br/><br/>PS: I didn't know that Lloyd Kaufman appears on this one, credited as the drunk. I'm just realizing about that fact and definitely I would like to check his appearance."
"Gotensive","10","0","0","8 September 2008"," Great movie that gets unfairly bashed
","Although it has a massive fan-base, Rocky has also garnered a massive backlash because it defeated the widely acclaimed Taxi Driver for best picture. Maybe it didn't deserve to beat the masterpiece that is Taxi Driver, but to deny that it's a fantastic & well made inspirational sports drama, IMO, is ridiculous. The acting is top notch all-around, even from Stallone, who is considered the king of Razzies. Everyone knows the story. It's about a down on his luck Philadelphia boxer who is given a title shot by the respected and beloved heavy weight champion of the world. The boxer manages to go the distance, and manages to get the girl. Predictable and clichéd storyline? To a certain extent, yes, but it's the characters that draw you in. Each and every one of them you get to know well, and you feel for them, even Apollo Creed, who is not made out to be a villain, but more a man with lots of pride who's on top of the world and has nothing else left to prove. The ending of this movie does hurt the argument that the movie is entirely predictable. Rocky does go the distance, but he gets beat up pretty bad, and loses the fight. It's the perfect ending to go with, and in a way elevates it above the predictable and clichéd tag this movie gets labeled with. Anyway, this is a personal favorite of mine, and I have no qualms with it's best picture win. This movie manages to entertain and at the same time inspires you, which is something very few movies do."

","When you've spent so long watching the ridiculous (but glorious) excesses of Rocky III and Rocky IV, you kind of forget how down to earth the original film is. To be sure it can't exactly be called gritty, as it's something of a grown-up fairytale, but at least it has its feet somewhere near the real world.<br/><br/>The film starts with Rocky fighting in some fleapit. He doesn't really seem to care. He's not trying. But then near the end, his opponent, the fabulously named Spider Rico, headbutts him. This gives him the eye of the tiger and he knocks the guy out. When he's motivated, Rocky has it in him to achieve great things.<br/><br/>But how do you summon that will when your life is so pitiful? Rocky lives in a nasty apartment ('It stinks!'), works as a small-time heavy for a local crook, trains at a run down gym, walks the cold, miserable streets of Philadelphia and awkwardly tries to woo the shy Adrian at the local pet store. It's not much of an existence.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes is when Mickey comes crawling to Rocky at the Italian Stallion's apartment asking to train him. Previously Mickey has considered Rocky nothing more than a bum and has even thrown all his stuff out of his locker. But with the World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed picking Rocky as his next opponent in a gimmick New Year's bout, Mickey tries to get a piece of the action. He spends lots of time selling himself, telling Rocky about his experiences years ago as a boxer. He even shows Rocky pictures. But all the time Rocky can't even look at him, and when Mickey is showing him his photo, he plays darts. It's quite a cruel scene, although you can understand Rocky's anger. Like he says, he needed Mick's help ten years ago.<br/><br/>But the scene gets even crueller. As Mickey is talking, Rocky goes to the toilet. Mickey speaks to the door and mentions that he's 76-years-old. We realise that this is his last chance at a title fight. But with Rocky still in the toilet, Mickey goes to leave the apartment. But as he's doing so, apparently thinking he's already gone, Rocky emerges from the loo. However, seeing that Mickey is still there, he turns around and walks back in. It's a real punch in the balls and we finally see how vulnerable Mickey is. And then when Mickey is walking down the stairs Rocky rants and raves about how his apartment stinks. It's actually an excellent piece of acting from Stallone and it's the one time that Rocky acts like a heel  even when he's trying to collect money as a heavy he's still pretty nice. But Rocky can't be mean for long and chases after Mick to presumably say sorry and ask him to be in his corner  filmed in a long shot, there's an excellent detail when Rocky finally catches up to the trainer; before Rocky embraces him, Mickey backs away like he's frightened. Despite how loud he is, he's still only a frail old man.<br/><br/>Another fabulous scene is the one at the ice rink. Yes it's goofy, but that's part of Rocky's charm. He's a lovable innocent, always talking and always dispensing incoherent advice. He even says that he and Adrian make a fine couple, what with him being dumb and her being shy  as Rocky puts it, they fill gaps; they make up for each other's shortcomings. And their scenes are always sweet and well performed.<br/><br/>There's only one scene where things turn a bit queasy and that's the scene where Rocky takes Adrian back to his place. Rocky shows off his muscles by stripping down to a wifebeater vest and Adrian mentions that she's never been alone in a man's apartment before. You kind of feel scared for the poor girl, what with this horny beefcake relentlessly coming onto her. The lovable Rocky suddenly seems a pit pushy and predatory. But eventually everything works out. However, in a later scene, the tables are turned. Rocky's training for his title fight and Adrian wants some sweet loving. She keeps on pestering the guy, determined to ruin his chances of performing well in his fight. I mean, as Mickey says, 'Women weaken legs.' Therefore Rocky has to briefly push her away  she can make up for her barren years after the fight.<br/><br/>The fight itself is what you'd expect from a Rocky film: enjoyable but silly. Sure it doesn't descend into the cartoon brutality of the later films, but you still have men pounding each other mercilessly for 15 rounds (boxers were real men in the 70s  none of this 12 rounds nonsense). But even though it can't compare to the fights in Raging Bull or subsequent boxing films, the ending is hard to beat. Rocky manages to stand toe to toe with the champion and not humiliate himself, and by refusing to stay down when he gets knocked to the floor in the 14th round, he finally proves his self-worth. Yeah he doesn't win the fight but he regains his self-respect, which is a major victory in itself.<br/><br/>And the ending with Rocky and Adrian embracing, and with the image paused at the greatest moment of Rocky's life, sweeps you off your feet and puts a massive smile on your face. Yes the Rocky films would subsequently go off into la-la land and any notion of reality would be smashed in the face, but at that moment the love of a good woman and the restoration of a man's spirit is a bigger victory than winning a boxing title. Of course Rocky didn't deserve to triumph over Taxi Driver at the Oscars, but I don't begrudge him his victory too much. Rocky is an underdog tale that wins you over with hard work and good old-fashioned working class charm."

","Rocky is more than just a boxing movie. Rocky is about going after your dreams when the opportunity arises. Everyone can relate to being the underdog, to being the down and out guy without a chance of actually being the one to come out on top. Rocky Balboa uses boxing as a metaphor to just capitalize on the great opportunities that come by in life.<br/><br/>The whole premise of the movie is an unknown getting a shot at the heavyweight champion. Carl Weathers, (played by Apollo Creed) the heavyweight champion of the world gives Rocky a chance because he likes his nickname, The Italian Stallion because he knows it's marketable. Apollo doesn't take Rocky with any seriousness. Why should he? He belittles him during the televised press conference, doesn't train for the fight, and degrades and humiliates Rocky when he ever gets the chance to (Before the start of the fight). What makes Rocky so unique and wonderful is that they don't cookie-cutter anyone as the main villain. Apollo can be seen as a generous man, and although he talks down to Rocky he certainly isn't the bad guy. And it's not even like Rocky wants to beat Apollo, it's almost like Rocky wants to beat himself, do the best he can by ""going the distance"" and Apollo is just the best fighter in his way for him to try to achieve his goal. <br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes that I feel makes Rocky so special is the night before the fight. Rocky wonders around the stadium, and then goes back home to Adrian to say ""he can't beat him."" This is a moment where Rocky sort of admits defeat; it's a gripping, captivating scene that displays the more gritty realism of Rocky. Everyone from time to time has those moments of doubt, where they realize that it just ain't realistic and feasible. This shows the depth and character of Rocky, almost as if he has sort of been broken down. At this time, Rocky just decides that ""All he wants to do is go the distance. Nobodies ever gone the distance with Creed, and if the bell rings and I'm still standing... maybe I'll realize I wasn't just another bum for the neighborhood."" This scene is so pivotal in marking a fairy-tale movie like Rocky so much more gritty and realistic. <br/><br/>The training montage with ""Gonna Fly Now"" blasting through the screen while Rocky runs up the steps is easily one of the most memorable, recognizable, and inspirational scenes of all time. It's like a metaphor for somebodies triumph; Rocky runs from the lower class section of town to the more intellectual area. He runs from the bottom to the top. He turns around to the face the city in which he came in and he raises his arms higher than the skyscrapers. The symbolic nature of the shot is astounding, and it is probably the most inspirational image from any film ever. <br/><br/>Rocky is just such a magical, emotional, powerful film. You feel like your in it with Rocky, and during the fight scene your standing up screaming for Rocky. It's such an incredible experience. It's sentimentalism at its best. The acting is terrific all across the board. Burgess Meredith is perfect as Rocky's trainer. Burt Young is great as the drunk, jealous, irritated friend. Taili Shire is great as the shy pet shop worker. And Sylvester Stallone was born to play the down and out, lovable boxer. At the time, Roger Ebert said Sly would be the next Brando. Well, that didn't quite work out for Sly, but he delivered an excellent performance in Rocky. The score is one of the essentials for fueling the film, and is easily one of the best fitting scores of all time. And the cinematography make for some of the most memorable scenes in movie history. Everything is just so great about Rocky, which is what makes it what you love so much about movies. 10/10 I recommend it for everyone."

","The music starts and the scrawling black and white lettering moves across the screen. The fanfare is a triumphalist sound that will clearly lead into an epic story. So to go from that to a dingy fight club in Philly is a strange twist. The boxing on display in the ring is far from pedigree as two ten-a-penny brawlers slug it out in the ring, one clearly moving away from anything resembling a prime. The fans don't like it and jeer, and as the fighter leading decides to crank it up a notch he backs the loser on the ropes and head butts him. The violent assault sparks him into action and he drives his opponent back and wins by a knockout. The money earned is minuscule and there is little reward for the effort and pain endured.<br/><br/>Thus begins the story of Rocky, a man who truly is a bum from the neighbourhood. As the film goes on we learn more about him, he is a collector for a loan shark, a hired goon paid to break people's fingers if they don't cough up what they owe. This should make us dislike him more, but it doesn't, because like the very people he is collecting from he is on the bottom rung of society's ladder. A man for whom breaks of anything but the physical type are exceedingly rare.<br/><br/>Cut to a man at the top rung, a man for whom things don't go wrong and for whom setbacks are a major inconvenience for his perfect world. Apollo Creed, heavyweight champion of the world, being informed that his snow white underdog cannot fight due to a broken hand, with no other fighters willing to go head to head with him he seeks a novelty, and plumps for the idea of fighting a nobody, a club fighter, a ham and egger for the million to one shot prize of the heavyweight title on offer, and in spite of protestations from his trainer he picks Rocky Balboa.<br/><br/>And so we have what is probably the greatest fictional underdog story of all time (True-life underdog film is ""Seabiscuit""). In spite of the sequels that came after this is a low budget, Indy style movie and when you watch it, should be judged as such. The performances from Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young and the irrepressible Carl Weathers are flawless, just check out Stallone's face when being informed he is ""A tomata!"" and his realisation, in the key scene of the movie while he stands alone in the ring, of the enormity of his situation the night before the fight. This is acting where anymore would be too much and any less would too little. Stallone nails the scene.<br/><br/>The script is a brilliant study of the underbelly of society and how it reacts to such incredible moments of life and the direction is excellent by John G. Avildsen, but the second star of the film, other than the actors, is the unbelievably brilliant score by Bill Conti, whose trumpets, strings and vocal arrangements are unforgettable after the first time you've heard it.<br/><br/>There are good and bad sequels to this film, some of which have been documented within my own reviews, but this is the first, it's raw power is not diminished and the ending is still one that I never tire of seeing, even to this day.<br/><br/>Nuff said <br/><br/>Em."

If you want the entire movie to have boxing matches then you will be disappointed, Well that would get tiring because the movie would not have a plot. So I was not disappointed. Rocky Part I is a great film. This film is infamous. Since that most people have seen this, there are some people that haven't seen this. They need to see this. This is my 9th favorite film ever. Sylvester Stallone was in a few films before this. Starting out with that porno that he did. Rocky is a great film. Best film from 1976. Great film about a boxer. Everyone who has not seen this needs to see this. Rocky Part 1."

","I just finished watching ""Rocky"" for the first time in a few years. I first watched it as age 9 and now I am 12. The film is the best dramatic film on the life of a not so smart underdog who just wants his break. The film is powerful and certainly delivers its message.<br/><br/>The film is about Rocky Balboa, a down and out wrestler who never got his break. He then gets offered to a game from Apollo Creed, the boxing champion of the world as he looks to get an unknown an opportunity as it is of course the land of opportunity.<br/><br/>The film is so cleverly written, directed and the acting performances are so top notch in this (Especially Sylvester Syllone) and are so good that it is hard to watch them in another film.<br/><br/>Overall this is a masterpiece of status and pure brilliance in the art of film making. The movie deserves (As it is) to be recognized as one of the best movies ever. I rate this film 82%. I recommend this to anybody and everybody."

"tthrow1","10","0","0","24 April 2008"," The Underdog of All Underdogs
","Rocky is an action packed underdog story, which's incredible acting and astounding musical set only accents the great storyline to the masterful piece. Robert ""Rocky"" Balboa, the story's main protagonist, is played by newcomer at the time, Sylvester Stallone. Balboa is your average ""mean streets"" guy, who is a bookie for a living. On the side, Rocky fights in small boxing matches to make some money to get by. All the while, Balboa is trying to woo the ever timid sister of Paulie, Rock's, what seems to be, only friend. Adrian, played by Talia Shire, is the object of Balboa's attention throughout. As Rocky and Adrian's relationship develops, he gets the shot of a life time against the champion of the world, Apollo Creed. The struggle Balboa must partake in both physically and mentally as not only a fighter, but as a human being, strengthens him all the way to the title fight.<br/><br/>The movie carries many underlying tones to help emphasize this fighter's tale. One main conflict in the movie is the clash between black and white. The civil rights movement was just beginning to die down at the time that the movie was released, which was 1976. What makes this setup unique is the role reversal that takes place. Typically, you have the uneducated lower class black man trying to fight against the slings of the wealthy upper-class white man. Now the viewer witnesses the polar opposite. Balboa fights his way up through the social ladder to even get to the level to where he can step in the ring with such a noble figure. The reasoning behind this is not to create more tension between races, but to prove the point that in social interactions, in this case, a boxing match, people are people, regardless of race. Anyone has the capabilities to achieve whatever they work for regardless of social restrictions. A punch hurts no matter who it happens to. Both of these fighters bring each other full circle and show a mesh between the races. In the bout, they are no longer black and white, but fighter and fighter. This brings a unity to the human nature.<br/><br/>Another thing that stands out is the reasoning behind why would they place this plot into a boxing theme. A main theme of social evolution can be shown in almost any circumstance. The director chose to put this story into a boxing setting to show, not only a physical fight, but a social struggle. The boxing match symbolizes the hurdles that people of all races must overcome everyday and the fight they put up against it. They fight to achieve this unity among ethnicities and to come to the point of the ""championship"" of society.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, familiarities begin to surface between the characters, which gives rise to the idea that every character is another form and mold of Rocky. Starting with Adrian, they are like yin and yang. From their initial encounter, the viewer can tell that these two characters fill gaps in each other. They become puzzle pieces seemingly fit together to become this one object. This idea can be carried over throughout each others worries and concerns throughout the film. In the ice skating scene, Adrian tells Rocky that her mother told her that she didn't have much of a body, so she better start using your brain. Rocky then explains that his father told him the exact opposite, that he didn't have much of a brain, so he better start using your body. This shows that they were basically made for each other and the only way for them to truly evolve, they must come together.<br/><br/>Next up is Apollo. He is the polar-opposite of Rocky. The name says it all. Apollo being god-like, high and mighty, while lowly Rocky lives on scraps and on the dirt poor level. See the coincidence? Rocky stands for hard times and not a smooth life style, while the god Apollo lives the easy life. Then in their climatic bash, they offset each other no longer being individuals, but are now a cause. They now have meaning. Without each other they have only this bland individuality. In their physical interaction, they lose all of this and become the basis of human nature.<br/><br/>Finally you have Mickey, Balboa's senile and delusional trainer. His wisdom and guidance is what brings light and truth to Rocky's eyes. Mickey is the older version of Balboa. He is the aged fighter trying to live his dreams through a new prospect. Mickey is your typical FOIL character. He shows the audience everything Rocky is not and the potential he has to become something more advanced. He is the wise old man guiding a blind young man around showing him how to overcome the trials and tribulations that both have or are going to experience. Rocky must see the faults of a younger Mickey and stay on path to become something better, not only for himself, but to help Mickey come full circle.<br/><br/>All in all, Rocky is not your average underdog, but a beautiful display of innovative cinematography, deep character analysis, and meaningful dialogue. This is a must see for all members of the family. It is a story that many can relate to. It's that shot of a life time that everyone wishes for, but not always get. This will keep you on the edge of your seat cheering for more. I give this movie two thumbs up and is a must own for all ages."
"FlorianSchirner","8","0","0","14 April 2008"," Great founding stone of a series of documentary sequels
","Well, my summary may not be my most inspiring but it is meant wholeheartedly. First, I love ""Rocky"" and all of his sequels in their own way. I find it a great film and itself and the sequels show the ""Hollywood spirit"" during the years.<br/><br/>Let us watch Rocky unbiased. The storyline in itself is a bit shallow: A Nobody gets a chance to fight the champ, he does it and wins his girl friend during the movie. The End. As I said shallow. <br/><br/>But what Stallone did with this plot is amazing. He added many twists and turns to create a whole new plot. Instead many other Underdog-Sports-Movies, the underdog here is not a brilliant new talent or fallen-once-famous star but an average, down to earth bum like many of us know their whole life. Rocky is a bit of an idiot (we learn he is dyslexic in Rocky 2), but has strong own personal morals and thoughts. He is a bit of an Outcast, too. We see him with his sole friend Paulie (who seems not to be a real close friend) and the girl he adores, Paulie's sister. Adrian is too shy to even notice that Rocky adores her, which makes her an outcast too. <br/><br/>The next twist Stallone adds is how this Nobody gets the title shot. It is not because the champ notices the talent or has revenge plans....It is mere coincidence of the original opponent having an injury and Creed now has to look for someone to fight on short notice. Since the fight is at the 4th of July he makes the genial decision to create a media hype by giving an unknown a title shot. And he only chooses Rocky because of his ring name ""The Italian Stallion"" (""Apollo Creed versus the Italian Stallion, sounds like a damn monster movie."") <br/><br/>Then comes the film sequence of the training and all the story in between. Stallone walks here the fine line between a sports movie and a character development movie and he balances it superbly. We get to love this nerdy couple with all their all-to-well-known, ordinary troubles. We even learn to sympathize with the drunkard Paulie. And the training sequences are so great, the song ""Gonna fly now"" will always be engraved mentally to such training scene montages (as it itself or similar sounding copies are used up until today). <br/><br/>Last in the movie is the fight. Many have commented on its unrealistic appearance. Hey, it is played by two actors, who, though being athletic and even college/pro-athletes, never were boxers. And though they trained with a boxing coach, they lacked the money to do it extensively. So they scripted the fight step by step, blow by blow. And then they rehearsed it. This is quite an accomplishment. And to me, the fight looks as well as some you see in today's actual rings. <br/><br/>A word about the acting. Stallone shows here (like he does now too after leaving his action stardom behind) that he is quite a talented actor. The supporting cast is great, from heavies like Meredith and Young (both doing great scenes here, Oscar-worthy) to then unknowns like Carl Weathers and Thalia Shire.<br/><br/>The production is great too, thinking of the limited budget.I was fascinated by the camera work, which is better than many big-budgeteers at that time. If you love well made and emotional gripping films, who may have a bit of sports thrown into it, you definitely will love ""Rocky"". As to my statement that the sequels are documentary of how movies in their time were like, read my comments there."

","After watching a boxing match between Chuck Wepner and Muhammad Ali, Sylvester Stallone was inspired to write a movie about a Boxer who goes the distance to get a shot at the title, it took him three days to write the script and it took 28 days to shoot the film. This film became one of the greatest motion pictures of all time and won several Academy Awards, Rocky was such a hit that it spawned five sequels and made Phillideial a landmark with the Rocky steps and Rocky statue which was introduced in Rocky III. The film also had one of the most well known music scores in the world with the song ""Gonna fly now"". The acting in this movie is great and features awesome performances from the whole cast.<br/><br/>One thing that makes Rocky such a hit is the whole plot. He's a guy with not much money trying to become a Boxer meanwhile he's working for a Loan shark (Played by the late, great Joe Spinell.), in his spare time Rocky's trying to get the shy pet store woman Adrian to go out with him. Rocky is asked by her brother Paulie to come to Thanksgiving, after an argument Rocky asks her out and they do and soon there relationship grows. Meanwhile the champion Apllo Creed decided to throw an event to allow an Underdog boxer to get a shot at the title, while looking through the books he notices the Italian Stallion and tells them that he's the one he's going to fight. Rocky is called to meet with one of the people and he accepts the challenge even thought he's intimidated by the whole thing, Micky the tough owner of the gym comes around and tries to convince Rocky to have him train him for the big fight. At first Rocky doesn't want to after the way he treated him but soon he decides to let him train him, Rocky then trains has hard as he can to become the best and beat the champ for the ultimate shot at the title.<br/><br/>Rocky is a great timeless classic that's touching and inspirational. Check this out. 10/10"
"jsterkel","10","0","0","8 April 2008"," Arguably One of the Best Movies of All Time
","Most people probably like Rocky but I don't think most people know how good the movie really is. To credit Stallone would be the start of why this movie is great. Not only is it great I think it is one of the greatest of all time. Now you might ask you mean it's Battleship Potemkin and Rocky? You might laugh and ignore the comment and read something else but I think that you might have to re watch the film with a different lens to appreciated it fully. Now I know that there is no Odessa Steps in Rocky so don't laugh. One reason that I love the film so much is that the message is so simple that anyone, including children, can grab hold of it. You can't say that for Potemkin. Another reason is that the film is completely heart and shows a character that is down and out. The character comes from no where and has nothing except love in his heart for a regular looking women. So typology is something that Potemkin and Rocky share, that is to Rocky's credit. The scenes consist of seemingly everyday conversations with everyday thoughts, nothing profound is said, at least not on the surface. What is really being said here that the America Dream is alive and well, honestly that was said more in the sequels but I'm talking about the original movie. What I think is being said is that in life we go the distance. Rocky doesn't win the match, he simply goes the distance when no one except a handful of people told him that he could even fight Apollo Creed. That is the magic of the movie the magic is that we all have the ability to fight the good fight in life. We need more movies to not tell us that we will all have a slice of the American pie but that within us all is a un-dying spirit that can not be put out by even the greatest of circumstances. So look again at this average movie and maybe you'll see what I saw."

","Rocky the movie is a legend and it launched the career of it's principal actors especially Stallone. But more then that this movie created a genre that is still widely imitated to this day. Rocky is about a aging fighter from a slum neighborhood he works for a local loan shark as a enforcer but Rocky's too good natured for that line of work and when he can he fights. Also Rocky is in love with adrian his best friends sister she's shy but she also likes Rocky. Life is not great for Rocky but he's Happy enough comfortable is more like it. Then things change in the form of Apollo Creed The Heavyweight Champion of the world he needs a fighter to fight for a big bi centennial match and chooses Rocky based on his nickname the Italion Stallion. From there Rocky's life Changes and the people around him change as well. Does He win the Big Fight? Does he get the Girl? None of that's really important the journey itself is the important part here the Championship fight is only the icing on a very wonderful cake. I have seen this movie so many times I've memorized the lines and the scenes I can speak the lines before the actors do(It really annoys my Wife) But This movie is one of my important films of my life it's stayed with me from 1976 til now and it has not diminished in it's importence to me or other fans. A film Stallone must be proud of."

","Eleven Step Breakdown 1. Rocky's overall want is respect. 2. Rocky logically goes for it. a. Rocky fights as often as he can to earn money and respect. b. He also works as a muscle for a Philadelphia loan shark, Gazzo. c. He makes up jokes to attempt to win Adrian over, his love interest. d. Tries to be a role model for the community. 3. He is denied  a. Mickey Goldmill, his trainer, tosses him out of his locker at his gym. b. Rocky is chastised for not breaking the thumbs of a guy he is collecting from. c. Adrian is very shy and doesn't respond to his advances. d. Walks home with a younger girl and offers advice on how to get a better life and get off the streets, and she responds ""Screw you, creep-o!"" 4. Rocky gets a second opportunity when Apollo Creed, boxing champion, handpicks Rocky for a shot at the World Heavyweight Title. 5. Rocky is conflicted. He believes he has not shot at the title, and could never stand toe to toe with the champion. Rocky has no manager and doesn't want to be made a fool on national television. 6. Rocky knows he can't turn down what may be the only shot of his life. He accepts the challenge. 7. All goes well for Rocky for a while.<br/><br/>a. Mickey offers to manage him.<br/><br/>b. He begins training (classic raw eggs scene and training montage).<br/><br/>c. Adrian comes around and they get along well. The have a Thanksgiving date at the local ice rink.<br/><br/>d. Philadelphia starts watching him train and supporting him.<br/><br/>e. Does a television interview.<br/><br/>f. Gazzo gives him money for training expenses.<br/><br/>g. Rocky's purse for the fight is $150,000. 8. Things Falls Apart<br/><br/>a. Paulie goes on a Christmas rant, kicks out Adrian and Rocky.<br/><br/>Other than this scene, the movie is a build up to the fight sequence. 9. a. The crisis I think is three fold. The peak of his training would be the big training montage, being pushed harder than ever before to get into the best shape of his life. The sequence is filled with one arm push-ups, cross town running, chicken chasing, and a run up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art<br/><br/>b. There is also a critical mental point, Rocky goes into the venue the night before the fight. The fight promoter comes out and Rocky tells him the color of his boxing trunks on the giant banner is wrong, the promoter responds ""It doesn't really matter does it.""<br/><br/>c. The final spoken crisis comes during morning of the fight, Rocky tells Adrian he can't beat Apollo. He says all he wants to do is go the distance, and still be standing at the end of the fight. ""Then I'll know for the first time in my life, I wasn't just another bum from the neighborhood"". 10. The climax is the championship fight. 11. Truth Comes Out  Rocky goes the distance and Adrian says she loves him. He has earned the respect of his city and the world. Now to the hospital to rest up for five more films based on the same formula! He has become a success."

Beautifully acted by Sylvester Stallone (sadly to say one of his only few great performances) and Talia Shire as Adrian his love interest.

"sddavis63","9","0","0","11 March 2008"," Definitely One Of The Greats
","This is not only one of the best sports movies ever made, it's got to rank as one of the most impressive films ever made. Rocky Balboa must be perhaps the most memorable character Hollywood has ever come up with. Really - is there another character that could compete? Maybe James Bond - except he wasn't a Hollywood creation; he came from novels. The memorable thing about Rocky is that he's everyone - everyone who has ever been down and out, everyone who has ever felt that life didn't give him a fair shot, everyone who has regrets about not having lived their dreams - and who doesn't fit in there somewhere? Rocky Balboa (whom Sylvester Stallone was absolutely born to play) is a bum. There's no other word for it. He's uneducated and crude, he lives in a rundown apartment in a rundown part of Philadelphia, he makes a living by collecting for the local loan shark and sometimes by being a club fighter, and from the opening scenes of the movie - featuring a depiction of one of his club fights - he's a club fighter who's even outclassed by the other club fighters, except that when he gets mad, boy can he punch! And - when he wins, bloodied and bruised, he gets the winner's share, which amounts to all of $40.55, if I remember correctly. But there's another side to Rocky. You see it early in the movie when he returns to his apartment after that club fight and he stares at a picture of himself as a young boy. It's in his eyes - ""What happened to me? What happened to that young boy?"" And you keep seeing it. There's a gentle, even playful side to him. He can't bear to break the thumbs of a guy who owes the loan shark money, he looks out for a young girl who's hanging out with a bad crowd, he picks up a drunk passed out on the cold streets outside a bar and carries him inside to warm up, he likes animals (he has pet turtles and a goldfish) and he plays with the animals at the local pet store. And - most important to the movie - there's a sweet sort of innocence to him as he struggles to come up with the words to ask the equally shy Adrian (Talia Shire) - who works at the pet store - for a date. Rocky is a far more complex character than most people think.<br/><br/>And then, out of the blue, comes the big break. The Heavyweight Champion of the World - Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) - needs to find a replacement opponent. A huge Bicentennial Fight (the movie was made in 1976) has been promoted and a lot of money spent and the top contender has been injured and can't fight. No other ranked contender is interested - they need more than a few weeks to prepare. So, Creed reasons, we need an angle - we'll give an unknown a shot at the title. And from the multitudes of nobodies who certainly must exist, Rocky Balboa is chosen - not because he's a good fighter or even well known, but because Creed figures he can promote the heck out of his nickname - ""The Italian Stallion."" And the movie leads up to the climactic bout between the two.<br/><br/>Two scenes stand out for me (several do, actually, but these two most of all.) The night before the fight, Rocky can't sleep and goes over to the Spectrum, where the fight is to be held. When he returns, he sits on the bed beside Adrian and admits to her that he realizes he can't win - he's not even in Creed's league. But, he realizes, he doesn't have to win. All he has to do is go the distance (15 rounds). No one has ever gone the distance with Creed, he says, and if he does he'll prove to himself that he's not ""just another bum from the neighbourhood."" Then there's the 14th round. After a brutal fight, Creed finally knocks Rocky down. Rocky's own corner men (led by his manager Mickey - played superbly by Burgess Meredith) call out to him to ""stay down."" He's been magnificent; he's got nothing left to prove. Creed figures the fight is finally over and puts his arms up to celebrate his victory, then watches in disbelief as Rocky struggles to his feet and gestures at him to keep going. Rocky makes it all the way. He goes the distance. He loses the decision, but it doesn't matter, because sometimes losing is just as good as winning.<br/><br/>What a great movie, and well deserving of its Oscar. There were just a couple of things that gave a bit of an unbelievable edge to it. First, this fight would never be sanctioned as a title bout. It would have been at best an exhibition match, with the title not up for grabs; second, I find it hard to believe that the referee would have let Rocky continue after the knockdown in the 14th round, given the shape he was in at the time. But it's a movie. Suspend disbelief, and just enjoy - and one of the things that you will enjoy the most is the unforgettable ""Rocky"" theme music!<br/><br/>The ""Rocky"" franchise may be getting old and tired. The first two sequels were all right, the next two were awful, and I haven't seen the latest installment (""Rocky Balboa"") where a sixty year old Rocky returns to the ring. But even if the franchise is getting old and tired, the first of the movies will always be one of the greats! 9/10"

","There aren't many films like this. Forget the sequels except the most recent one which was good. This film is dear to me because I feel for this character. Coming home to his turtles.. talking to them.. asking them why they weren't at his last fight cuz he ""did good."" The guy isn't bright but he's got morals and values. No one really gives a damn about him until suddenly he gets a shot at the title and everyone wants to be his friend. Brilliant scenes that come off honest and desperate, yet very charming. Another thing is the way Philadelphia is shown. Nothing is glamorized. Everything is as is without any bullsh*t. I've seen many boxing movies, but the story and sheer rawness that this one has just cannot be beat. <br/><br/>Raging Bull falls short because LaMotta is simply unlikable. The story is well, OK at best and the fighting sequences... lol. People talk about Rrocky fighting sequences being unrealistic? Watch Raging Bull, they're terrible. A fighter throwing 5 roundhouse right hooks in a row landing all five. Pretty weird. Anyway it's just my opinion. It's a shame that Stallone never tops, or matches his performance here because it's absolutely fantastic."

The only reason we know the name Sylveter Stalone today is due to his authorship of ""Rocky"". This movie is an inspirational gem! It shows us all that is good within even the dullest exterior. The possibility of duality and complexity of characters without great intelligence. The lacking of a realistic plot is made up for by the purity of character depicted in Rocky Balboa. This movie carried with it a message that needed to hit home within the inner city population's of America. The time period was crying for a hero, and Rocky certainly delivered.

","Rocky is one of the best movies ever made. Not from a technical point of view, but from an emotional one. A movie so extraordinarily powerful that I'm almost lost for words. I wont go much into the plot. It's about a young fighter(who's fallen for Adrian,the girl in the pet shop) determined to get some self-worth. He gets his chance when hes offered a chance to fight for the world title, and of course he gets the girl. <br/><br/>It's predictable, but thats kind of the point. It's so involving and touching to go through rocky's experience.The fight is the allegory, the deeper meaning, the showcase for rocky's determination.

"Mr-Brightside","9","0","0","20 June 2007"," The Film that set the ball rolling (in more ways than one).
","A movie criminally overlooked for the great piece of art it is because of the hideousness of it's sequels and the whole embarrassing sub-genre this, the original underdog story, duly spawned. Back in 1976 and even today Rocky was and should continue to be looked upon as not only groundbreaking, but also as a truly landmark moment in western cinema. I don't merely hyperbole either, because Rocky was the first of it's kind; it was the movie that created an archetype. The underdog story, in which a million-to-one shot gets his one chance at stardom and overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to top the world, is now, an all too familiar tale, but back in 1976 this type of tale, one that captured the very essence of the American dream had never before been brought to the big screen. It was the first of what was now to become a genre of it's own; it was innovation at it's finest.<br/><br/>Along with proceeding a long line of copycat stories it was a sports film that wasn't necessarily cantered around the sport; true, the fight was the showpiece of the film but the interpersonal interaction between Rocky and the film's other primary protagonists (Mick, Adrian, Paulie, Apollo, and that gangster guy who's name escapes me currently), provided the ammunition and the motivation behind the Rocky character. The film wasn't only about the sport of boxing it was a step into the human psyche and an analysis on just what the human is capable of under any given circumstance. Rocky was symbolic and a metaphor for the American dream. It was hard hitting (pardon the pun) and frank about putting forth the values and ideology that shaped and continue to, even in an era of immediate gratification, shape American, and to a lesser but no less resonant degree, western society.<br/><br/>In this regard the film was also a pretty apt form of social commentary. Using the city of Philadelphia as a backdrop for the times and something of a secondary character for which to juxtapose with the character of Rocky. After Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, mid 1970's America ushered in a new era in American history; a time of hope, a time of freedom and a time when the American dream was as strong as ever, and Rocky, as well as the city of Philadelphia helped represent this wonderfully.<br/><br/>A flawless film that captivated a generation and saw life imitate art, in that it shot Sylvester Stallone from wandering nobody to worldwide, overnight super stardom. The perfect Cinderella story and quite possibly the perfect film."

","Who could dislike the film?, because it is just impossible to hate! Sylvester Stallone is nothing short of perfect in this one, still most properly his best performance to date. It would be very easy to compare Rocky with that of Raging Bull, only that would be an injustice because both films have completely different motives.<br/><br/>Rocky, a down and out boxer from the streets of Philadelphia, surrounded by poverty finds himself in the fight of his life against the champion of the world. Seems like such a simple premise, yet so much is happening between all it's characters, that the film never gets dull. The supporting cast is one of a kind. Talia Shire, Burgress Meredith, Burt Young, along with many others, all play roles that can be found down most streets whilst Carl Weathers wonderfully paints a picture of the ego that goes with fame and fortune as the Champ determined to give Rocky a hard time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film has been overlooked in terms of great films because of it's lesser sequels. It's a shame, because when you watch the film on it's own merit, it truly is one of the best romantic sports dramas ever made. I dare anyone to find a more heartfelt climatic ending in a film than this one. It's climax; a battered and bloodied Rocky frantically calling out for his real true love...Adrian! <br/><br/>The memories that viewers take home with them however continue to be director John G.

","Rocky is not only by far the best of the series it is also in my opinion one of the greatest movies of all time. Sylvester Stallone is amazing in this. Add the fact he wrote the movie and you can see he deserves his superstar status. Ten years later he was doing stuff like Cobra but never mind! Rocky is as they say a true underdog story, a boxing story and above all a love story between Rocky and a shy pet shop worker called Adrian. Also a friendship between him and Adrians brother Paulie, a bitter man with a chip on his shoulder but a good guy underneath. Also Boxing trainer Mickey played by a superb Burgess Meridith and World Champion Appolo Creed played by the under-rated Carl Weathers. All the ingredients make this an amazingly uplifting movie. Praise to Bill Conti too for producing the now very familiar music, although there is very little of it at the beginning only when Rocky starts to train for the big fight. The film has so may memorable images, especially when Rocky runs up the steps in Philadelphia. Also loads of endlessly quotable lines, many of which are very funny. On a final note, one thing I have noticed about the Rocky movies, Rockys career seems to run very close to Stallones in as such if Rocky is on top of his career then so is Stallone in Hollywood. Rocky II is similar to this but III and IV are just pure entertainment and V tries to get back to the style of this one. Rocky Balboa (out at the end of 2006) will have to be some movie to come close to this one thats for sure."

Rocky film, character and Sly him self were icons which reflected American culture to world. Asian and African countries knew America as Rocky and Rambo in 1970s,1980s and 90s.

","I know, I know, most people yawn when they hear about the next Rocky sequel, but these movies stand the test of time. The first Rocky movie, in my opinion is one of the greatest movies of the past 35 years. All those film students out there will be up in arms saying that is not possible. Most would say that some foreign film that nobody has ever heard of is the best. Though I had several film courses on a university level, I don't consider myself some scholar. I like what I like. My DVD collection is filled with Criterion titles and foreign films which I love, but it somehow all comes back to Rocky. It is one clichÃ© after another, but it's brilliant in it's simplicity. How can you not root for this underdog? People say how stupid Rocky is, that he's an oaf, etc. Rocky ISN'T supposed to be some nuclear physicist, he's just a down on his luck, poorly educated boxer with a big heart. Take the sequence when he goes on his first date with Adrian. They are both nervous as nervous can be, but as we watch, they slowly start to open up to each other. A great example of this is when they're at the ice skating rink. The way they communicate and laugh is fantastic, one of the most ""real"" scenes I have ever seen in movie. Adrian says ""Why do you fight?"", Rocky says ""Because I can't sing and dance."". EXACTLY. The dialogue is crisp, they say exactly what they should say in that situation. Look at the ending, the scene where the winner is decided is a mere two second shot. Rocky isn't even paying attention, he's looking for Adrian. The scene where she's standing in the tunnel and starts to run to the ring after the fight still gets me misty after all these years (and I know I'm not the only one who gets like that!). This is a film about inspiration and not backing down. When Rocky gets up after the 14th round, his right eye swollen shut, his face looking like it was run over by a truck, he never backs down. He gestures to Apollo, as if saying ""Come on, bring it."". Apollo just shakes his head. Apollo may know he has already won the match, but Rocky won it all. He won self respect, the respect of Mickey, the respect of the country, and the love of Adrian. I've started jogging in the past few months and every time I'm at the park I try to push myself a little bit further. A film like Rocky shows us that we can all go the extra mile. This is a great film and not to be missed."

Moreover I think it's a great choice to let Rocky live in a-not-so-wealthy neighborhood, but not let him be such over-the-top gangster. Many things in the movie were not planed (ex. there ought to be many more people skating on the ice, Stallone's father and brother got a role in the movie, Butkus wasn't the original dog they wanted), but they were all solved and it looked very smooth.

","What a great feel good movie and what an immortal, if unlikely, hero! Boxing is just about the last thing I'm normally interested in, so for me to have enjoyed the movie that much, it must have been pretty fantastic. Sylvester Stallone gives an incredible, believable performance as the underdog boxer who isn't a rocket scientist and has been put down all his life, but is so sweet and innocent at heart. For me (and probably many) there almost isn't a Sylvester Stallone. He's just Rocky.<br/><br/>This famous movie tells the tale of a Philadelphia meat packer, Rocky Balboa, who gets an unexpected opportunity for fame by competing in a boxing match against the huge, cocky favorite, the World Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed. Of course Rocky, alias the Italian Stallion, is the underdog by a mile, so must train like crazy, under the direction of his older manager, Mickey (played by Burgess Meredith). Meanwhile the boxer-in-training meets a sweet, painfully shy girl, Adrian, a pet store clerk, who is quite unable to string two words together when talking with a man.<br/><br/>It's just a wonderful story. You cheer so overwhelmingly for this lovable big hunk, and want everything to work out for him, not just in the boxing ring (the whole audience was audibly cheering him on at the theatre back in 1976), but also the romance department. Talia Shire is totally convincing as the timid, endearing Adrian, that Rocky tries amusingly and unsuccessfully at first to impress. She really deserves a nice man. By the way, the movie has a fantastic musical score to accompany the training, the romance, and the Big Fight. I have an enduring mental picture of Rocky running up those steps to that lively and inspiring music...and so does everyone else who saw this movie. <br/><br/>Simple story really, with a venue of the boxing ring. It totally deserved its Best Picture Oscar, all its fame and popularity. I even enjoyed (though somewhat less) most of the numerous sequels...could never quite get enough of Rocky Balboa."

But he doesn't stop there. He doesn't bask in the limelight of his new found freak stardom. Instead he works hard and takes full advantage of that chance to become great and to prove himself, most importantly, to himself. ""Rocky"" shows us that real heroes are already out their. They're just waiting for their opportunity to shine."

","this is one of my all time favorite movies. I love nearly all parts and elements of this film: the underdog catching up, the lonely tough man, his will to fight.etc,and also the the plot; 'a small time boxer gets his one in million shot of becoming a world champion'. Rocky has a potential to motivate people to lift, work hard and finally achieve a great result. Slyvester Stallone, in his own production, has done a very good job at being a tough and motivated prizefighter. The soundtrack within this film is also cleverly made which suits the emotional aspects of this film. I would say that the highest point of this film would be the final scene which captures many people's hearts. this film is surely one of the best movies of the 70s; there is no doubt to it being a Oscar-winning film!"

For those who have not seen it i truly recommend seeing it, it would definitely be worth your time but not so much the other rocky's as they did not quite live up to their reputations. except rocky 4 with the Russian. every character was pretty much perfect all the way from Stallone to Paulie and Mickie ad the cocky Apollo who almost got beat by a so called nobody, the movie is just sick, why else would i even comment on it, its just a movie with a lot of heart and pure determination who doesn't want to be like the rock and go the distance with Apollo creed?"

","What can be said about Rocky at this point that hasn't already made it's way into these comments? I watched it over the weekend again and it is always a good decision. Now getting well into my 30's it holds an even closer appeal to me. The acting, the story, the music... the raw Philadelphia backdrop...quite possibly the perfect movie. Stallone would never be this textured again. Too bad his legacy has become diluted with Rhinestone and Stop or My Mom Will Shoot, or even Rocky V. Can't say that I'm looking forward to the sixth installment of the Rocky franchise, but I won't let that take away from this great film. This needs to be in the IMDb top 250, in fact, it's just plain ridiculous that it's not. Raging Bull was excellent, but the pace and the characters had nothing on this film, which makes it the greatest boxing movie ever."

","It is said that some movies can change people's lives. Rocky was one of them. In my view, Rocky isn't just about a bum getting a shot at the title, but a story of friendship and hope. It isn't much of a boxing movie like Raging Bull, but it's a love story. A chick flick that the guys will like, because it's so strong. You feel for Rock when he yells at Mickey in his apartment. You feel Rocky's pain when he can't even run up those famous steps in Philly. The most powerful scene in the film, is the Gonna Fly Now segment.

","When I was a young gun, I was the only one in my group of friends who loved and always watched the original Rocky.<br/><br/>My god, what a great film. Sylvester Stallone wrote the original draft in three days after seeing a palooka named Chuck Webner almost go the distance with Muhammad Ali.<br/><br/>But he must of had it in his mind before because you can't write characters like that in three days.<br/><br/>Paulie with his tough love. Mickey with his father-figure type. The egotistical but deep down respectful Apollo. Not to mention the painfully shy Adrian. These are characters that you love for the rest of your life.<br/><br/>We all know the plot. A down and out slugger from Philadelphia gets a shot at the World Heavyweight Champion. It's something that could only happen on a movie screen. But this is not about the somewhat unbelievable premise, it's about characters and Rocky not wanting to be just ""another bum from the neighbourhood"".<br/><br/>John G. Avildsen and his cinematographer James Crabe created an empty, cold and dark Philadelphia that draws you in even more. You really want Rocky to do something great.<br/><br/>There are so many great moments in this film. Consider the scene where the script forgets the plot for a minute while Rocky tries to set a neighbourhood girl on the right track. My favourite is when Mickey comes to see Rocky. But Rocky yells Mickey out of his apartment. ""Where were you ten years ago?"". The conclusion of this scene is beautiful and all done in one still long shot.<br/><br/>For the new generation that say this film is cli'ched and tired and so on. You need to remember that this was the first ultimate feel-good movie of it's kind. It started a whole new genre. But the ending's are always different.<br/><br/>So does Rocky achieve greatness? that's for you to decide. He definitely got his wish.<br/><br/>There is a bittersweet moment at the end where Rocky and Apollo agree that no rematch will occur.<br/><br/>Now years after all the mediocre sequels that lacked everything the original had, I wish Stallone had made that agreement as well.<br/><br/>The Boss."

","I saw Rocky when I was a nine year old kid and I didn't know from good movies, bad movies etc. All I knew, even at that young age, was I had something in common with the title character. We were both underdogs. Great movie aside, Rocky is one of the all-time best characters ever to be imagined and Stallone brought him to life perfectly. I have always wanted to meet Sly just to thank him for inspiring me with the confidence to do things I never thought I could do. See there was this neighborhood bully who used the beat the crap out of me just about every day and I never even fought back, it just wasn't my style. So one day my Grampa takes me to see Rocky and I was like ""Hey, I could fight back too, I could be like Rocky."" Even though that kid was bigger and older the next time he came at me I just pretended I was Rocky. And guess what? I beat the crap out of him that day and he never touched me again. I was one of the most liberating things that I have ever done in my life. I sometimes wonder how different of a person I may have been had I not seen Rocky and been inspired to stand up for myself. Would I have been a wimp all my life? I don't know. But what I do know is that seeing Rocky at that age and during that time was very formative and inspiring for me and my character.

","How can you write a review of Rocky and not mention the relationship between the protagonist himself and Adrian. I admit that this is an enthralling story about an underdog fighter that makes it all the way to the top yet that isn't the focus of the film. I think the point of Rocky is that it is his love for Adrian that makes him strong. At first they are the unlikeliest of matches yet he sees the beauty in her that nobody else does. This strong theme is carried throughout all five (not so much the fifth film actually) Rocky films and he makes it clear that the fame, the money, the big house doesn't mean a thing without her.<br/><br/>You'd have to have a cold heart not to shed a tear at the end of the film when Rocky ignores the media and not shouts but screams for Adrian to come to his side.<br/><br/>A film that will live on for decades to come!!"

","Rocky is one of the most famous movies ever and spawned one of the cinema's most popular franchises. Much of it forms one of the cornerstones of film history, and it has one of the most famous scenes ever. But many people disregard it as a great movie. Even now I am utterly insulted that it is not even in IMDb's top 250. That's just an outrage. Rocky is a true classic in its field.<br/><br/>It is also one of the most influential movies ever, perhaps not in cinematic techniques but in story techniques. Rocky is nothing else but the original underdog story. Nowadays it seems like every sports movie- no, it's really like this- employs an unthinkable underdog story. Every single one of those films takes their main focus off of Rocky.<br/><br/>This movie never gets complicated, never enters thought, doesn't have any big plot twists or jaw-droppers, much less any philosophy or thought-provoking considerations, but it stabs at what you feel most: your heart. It is simply impossible for any good person to feel nothing in their first viewing. You root for Rocky like you have never rooted for anyone else before. That is the essence of this movie.<br/><br/>However, Rocky does have some splendid moments of direction. The steps scene, something that has been imitated so many times, something that is just as deep into our culture as the Vader battle in Empire Strikes Back, actually has some fantastic cinematography. The best part of Avildsen and Stallone's work are the intercutting shots of Rocky training coupled with the classic Rocky theme song.<br/><br/>I have just hit at one of the major reasons for Rocky's emotional effect: the soundtrack. Bar none, Rocky has the best and most inspirational soundtrack ever put forth into a movie. The theme song and the battle theme will flat out pump you up. It may sound silly to someone who hasn't watched Rocky, but it's the truth.<br/><br/>The plot of Rocky is basically this: he is just another bum living in the streets of Philadelphia and the first half of the movie do a great job of creating a depressing environment and a feeling of hopelessness. He is also a boxer at clubs, very clumsy, unskilled, but with a lot of heart. Then he gets the chance of a lifetime: Apollo Creed, the world heavyweight champion, is looking for a local underdog to fight and he has chosen Rocky. From a million-to-one shot Rocky has a shot at the title. Little does he know that this is just a novelty. He trains hard with his trainer Mickey, who is one of the most lovable characters conceivable, and the movie eventually leads up to the climactic showdown with Creed.<br/><br/>That fight pushes this movie over the top. It still stands as one of the greatest boxing scenes in the history of the cinema, maybe not as realistic or atmospheric as those found in Raging Bull but just as entertaining. And the fact that the ending isn't your typical jolly olly underdog tale. Although the most inspiring movie tale ever told this movie is not a very light one.<br/><br/>In the end this stands as one of the greatest sports movies of all-time, in the Holy Trinity along with Raging Bull and Hoosiers. It is basically perfect in what it does and nothing more. Do not expect this movie to alter your life or your thinking, just get ready for an inspiring piece of film. 8.9.<br/><br/>""Did you get the license plate number?

","There is just something American about a bum rising up and making something about himself. Rocky Balboa has become synonymous with being a nothing, and proving that you can become something, and the 1976 film Rocky is where we find him. He's too small, too much of a nobody to do anything in his amateur boxing career, but when he gets his shot at the champion, Apollo Creed (played with all of the flair of an Ali-like boxer by Carl Weathers), he proves to himself that he can do something with his life. In true typical Philadelphia fashion, he is worshiped, not as a champion but as a guy with a lot of heart who didn't quite make it to the top. We Philadelphians have to take solace in getting close but we never get to the top. Sylvester Stallone wrote and starred in this Oscar winner for best motion picture of 1976, and portrays a down and out bum who had one shot and took it. In the end, he may not have won the fight, but he's happy with the girl, Adrian (Talia Shire), knows that he gave it his all, and came this close to be a world champion. The later Rocky movies were not quite as inspiring, because Rocky wins (in most of them), and where is the fun in that? Losing is still losing, but sometimes in losing, you find out something about yourself which is more important."

","When you think of ""Rocky"", you probably think of that soaring music, the film's many sequels, and possibly Sylvester Stallone drinking raw eggs. While all of those things are certainly a part of the ""Rocky"" experience, the film has so much more to offer.<br/><br/>Stallone wrote the screenplay about Rocky Balboa, a southpaw club fighter who makes his money as an enforcer for a Philadelphia loan shark despite his intrinsically sweet nature. Indeed, it is Rocky's sweet nature that leads him to see the beauty in Adrian, the shy girl that he visits at the pet shop every day. As Rocky helps Adrian to come out of her shell, he finds himself randomly chosen to go toe-to-toe with the heavyweight champ, Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>""Rocky"" isn't just about boxing but about people daring to dream of something better for themselves. The many pleasures of the movie include the easy, often funny dialogue and the well-shaded characters throughout. Stallone and Talia Shire share lovely chemistry while Burgess Meredith, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers - inhabiting Rocky's trainer Mickey, Adrian's somewhat sleazy brother Paulie, and the preening champ Creed, respectively - are great to watch.<br/><br/>Both the film and its title character ooze goodwill and heart.

","Whoever accuses Sylvester Stallone of being incapable of acting needs to watch this and then ask themselves if they are a fool. Acting has nothing whatsoever to do with slurring lines if that is what the role demands, and here Stallone gives one of the most famous performances in Cinematic history. If Spacey and Norton could show the range of emotions Stallone shows in this, i would admit that they are great actors, but they haven't yet, so i won't. Sentimental (not a flaw) and inspirational, we cheer for Rocky and hope that he will beat Apollo Creed, but perhaps more importantly we want to see him and Adrian end up together.<br/><br/>Stallone's script is sharp, Avildson's direction seems effortless, every performance is superb, the characters are real and the music is memorable and rousing. Lots of great images-Stallone and Shire in the ring at the end, Rocky running through the streets, the opening shot of the inner city boxing ring establishing where Rocky has come from.

","Some called Rudy the Rocky of the 90's. The story of the under dog who strives to beat the odds. Like Rudy, Rocky was based on true events. For Stallone, it was his chance to be a superstar. It was not only his break through performance that made Stallone a star. Many forget that Rocky was his screenplay. Much like the 1,000 - 1 shot that was Good Will Hunting, Stallone was in the same situation as Mat Damon and Ben Affleck. Both films were true labors of love. Both believed in their stories. Each wanted to do more than just make a little movie and earn a pay check from it. Rocky has become more and more of a classic as time passes. It is a universal story with themes of true grit and passion. More than just movies, the message that films like Rudy, Rocky, and Good Will Hunting leave the audience is timeless. They not only score big at the box office, they hit close to home with a story that is pure and truthful. These movies capture the essence of the settings they take place in whether it be Boston, Philadelphia or Notre Dame.

","I would have to say that Rocky is one of those gem flicks that everyone has seen but is misrepresented as a simple dramatic underdog story. This movie is so chock full of metaphorical scenes and symbols the movies' screenwriter Silvester Stallone must have been aware of its complexities. The opening scene (that lays the whole context of the whole movie) shows a stained glass window of the Virgin Mary and then slowly tilts down into a haze of smoke and darkness (hell, chaos). It is obvious to the majority of the audience that Rocky is a part of a group of characters in the film that are incomplete and represent complete anonymity, but the underlining theme of the rest of the movie is salvation; of the economic, political and self. Rocky knows the difference between what is right and wrong and although he is not an intelligent character, he is morally good internally. Apollo represents god and divinity and Rocky is the humble and kind subservient. Many, many beliefs, values, ideals behind this movie. A classic religious tale."

","*I don't think there's any spoilers, but I guess I'll put this here just in case.* ""Rocky"" is quite possibly the greatest movie ever made. You don't have to like boxing or Sylvester Stallone to love Rocky. There's humor, romance, drama, and action. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is poor, sweet, and a little slow. Every one pretty much thinks he's a bum, but he has a big heart. He tries to woo Adrian (Talia Shire), his friend Pauly's (Burt Young) sister, but she's so shy she won't even look at him half the time. When he finally wins her over is about the time heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) needs someone to fight--and he picks Rocky. Trained by the somewhat harsh Mickey (Burgess Meredith), Rocky works his tail off to get ready for the fight. He wants a chance to prove that he's not just some bum, and he does that and more. ""Rocky"" is the kind of movie that makes you cheer no matter how many times you see it. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Picture that it won in 1976. 10/10"

This film is the most meaningful though. The relationship between Rocky and Adrian takes centre stage and despite the un-realistic story with respect of the boxing, this is more engaging, this is basically an against the odds movie, not designed for realism but to have elements of realism in it. The script is good and Sly hasn't written anything nearly as good since. What makes this film so successful however are the fantastic performances. Stallone is excellent as Rocky, its a fantastic performance right down to the way Rocky moves and the mannerisms, while Talia Shire is equally good as Adrian. The scenes between Sly and Talia are movie magic. Burgess Meredith is also excellent and there is a fantastic turn form Burt Young as Adrian's abusive brother Paulie.

All in all, this movie is a classic, 10 out of 10. You need to see this movie, it's truly one of the great movies of all time"

","Written in 3 days and on a shoe string budget yet going on to win best picture, 'Rocky' was not just presenting an underdog story, it in fact was one. Telling the tale of a boxer with no direction who through mere luck gets a chance to face the reigning champ, Sylvester Stallone writes a powerful, if not a tad simplistic, story that went on to inspire millions. <br/><br/>Almost as surprising as the finale of the film is the fact that this film was of such high quality. The director, John G. Avildsen, was a competent film maker if nothing less. Although 'Rocky' was well directed, even winning Avildsen the Oscar, it became the one shining star in Avildsen's long career(and no, I do not count 'Karate Kid' nor 'Rocky 5').<br/><br/>What made this film stand out was the the unique and very personal performances of its main characters. Burt Young got an Oscar nod for his wonderful performance as Paulie, Rocky's alcoholic yet very lovable buddy. Talia Shire, also receiving an Oscar nod, plays Paulie's overly shy sister who is behind some of the worst glasses I have ever laid my eyes on. <br/><br/>Although she is a seemingly two dimensional character when she makes her first appearance, it soon becomes apparent that she has many dimensions to her character, most of which is revealed during her date with Rocky, who has had feelings for her for what seems to be a very substantial part of their lives.<br/><br/>But it is the titular character of Rocky who truly pushes this film up to greatness. Everything from his affectionately dopey stare to his wonderful pronunciation of words like ""yo"" and ""Adrian!"". <br/><br/>Even after the twentieth viewing, 'Rocky' and it's main character never fail to grab you by the heart and brighten up your day, and maybe even your whole way of living.<br/><br/>10 / 10<br/><br/>--Rob"

","I have often asked people to define a classic but no-one can really do it. The best explanation or 'definition' is Rocky. Rocky is powerful, popular, dated but still loved and a foundation for many newer film makers. Forgetting Sylvesters film debut which we all know was a porn film, his first real film was Rocky and it was a huge success. Everyone except for a few rare people absolutely love it and the reason is not clear, it was low budget and Sly was an unknown (except for those who watched his first film). But the film made it, or for Rocky fans like myself, it went the distance.<br/><br/>That, is a classic to me, other people might think different but I just want to say that it (and its sequels) are fantastic and will never be forgotten."

","Rocky tells the story of a struggling Philadelphia club fighter who, against all odds, manages to make something of his life. The movie stars Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, a club fighter who also works as a collector for a cheap second-rate lone-shark. Rocky is also in love with the shy pet-shop girl named Adrian. After winning her heart, Rocky's life will change forever when the world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed offers him an opportunity to fight him for the world heavyweight championship. Rocky accepts the challenge and starts training with his grumpy, but lovable manager named Mickey. The fight soon arrives and Rocky must realize that his whole life is now a million to one shot and that he must go the distance to become a winner. <br/><br/>When Rocky was released on November 21st, 1976, the world fell in love with the characters of this movie and the heart-warming love story about an ordinary man who takes his shot and fights to the end. The movie won three Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Editing. I still think that it deserved more than three awards out of ten, including awards for Stallone, Shire and Meredith. Rocky also revamped the image of the boxing movie bi giving it a new look that is still imitated to this day and also made Sylvester Stallone a major movie star. There are three things in this movie to watch for: the extraordinary script written by Sylvester Stallone, the score elegantly orchestrated by Bill Conti and finally, the final fight between Rocky and Apollo, which is one of the best boxing fights filmed to this day. If you like love stories, classic underdog stories or a good boxing story, you will love Rocky and will forever cherish it.<br/><br/>10/10 EXCELLENT"

","How Sylvester Stallone managed to go downhill after this, his first film (which he also wrote), is a mystery -- he showed the greatest potential so early in his career.  Don't think Rambo here...think stuffed teddy bear! The world of boxing is really just a device for the story's reason for being -- courage, love, and the fulfillment of dreams.  Rocky doesn't have a chance against the world heavy weight champion, and he knows it...but that's not what matters.  He just wants to prove he has the heart to go the distance.  Women love the movie for Stallone's endearing characterization, and men love it for the boxing scenes.  The Rocky series -- all films -- are the only movies I ever attended where the audiences stood to their feet and cheered and applauded wildly.  I've never seen a reaction like that for any other movie -- and I doubt I'll ever see it again.  Don't miss this one...it's an experience of the heart."
"pendragon679","9","0","0","3 May 2004"," Simply Brilliant
","Probably the second-best boxing movie ever made, Raging Bull being the best (in my humble opinion), this is the picture that made Sylvester Stallone a star, and a household name.  His bravura performance as Rocky Balboa, ""The Italian Stallion"" who gets a million-to-one shot to fight the heavyweight champion is at the heart of this rousing film.  Never mind that such theatrics simply don't happen in the world of professional boxing. Stallone's writing captivates and draws in the audience such that we cheer along with the crowd in the climactic (and brilliantly choreographed) fight scene.  I remember seeing this in its first theatrical release and being so caught up in the moment that I was cheering as loudly as anyone else; I never heard half of that final sequence until I saw the picture on HBO years later.<br/><br/>Rocky features stand-out performances by everyone, most notably Talia Shire (taking a break from playing Connie Corleone) as Rocky's plain-Jane girlfriend, and the always-brilliant Burgess Meredith as Mickey, Rocky's gravel-voiced trainer and manager.  Ex-football player Carl Weathers give a nicely understated performance as Apollo Creed, a role that could have all-too-easily been played over the top.  Look for cameos by Joe Frazier and Stu Nathan.  Probably the best performance (other than Stallone's) is turned in by Burt Young, who in this picture perfected the greasy low-life that's become his signature.  One can only hope that he's acting, as he's so convincing in his portrayal that the viewer just wants to beat the crap out of him on general principles.<br/><br/>John Avildsen perfected his directorial signature in this effort, a signature that would later appear in the Karate Kid pictures with Ralph Macchio.  His camera captures the gritty, seamy side of south Philadelphia perfectly and, like Stallone's script, sucks the audience into his environment totally.  Notice, though, how the lighting appears to brighten and intensify as the story progresses and Rocky gains confidence.  Most of the first third of the picture seems to be shot in dim lighting, slightly out of focus, and with a narrow, claustrophic feeling.  As Rocky gains strength, both physically and otherwise, Avildsen's lens seems to open wider and the light to come up.  The focus sharpens until the scenes appear almost three-dimensional in their intensity.<br/><br/>If I had to pick one flaw in this cinematic masterpiece, I'd have to quibble with the physical appearance of the fighters, both Rocky and Apollo Creed. Neither is truly built like a heavyweight boxer; their waists are too narrow and their muscles too ""cut.""  Either one of these guys, if he were to step into the ring with a Mike Tyson or a Buster Douglas, would be pounded to a pulp before the end of three rounds.  And, let's face it: if any heavyweight fight were to get that bloody in reality, it would be stopped before any more damage could be done.  But, hey, it's just a movie, right?"
"slokes","9","0","0","14 April 2004"," Best Sports Film Ever
","The 1970s was a great decade for movies, maybe the best ever. People note two kinds of movies were getting made at an unprecedented success rate; big popcorn action thrillers like ""Jaws"" and ""Star Wars,"" and individual cinematic statements of artistic purpose, like ""Mean Streets,"" ""Nashville,"" and Godfathers I and II.<br/><br/>Then there's ""Rocky,"" a film that combines the best of both. It's an unrepentant crowd pleaser, with visceral boxing scenes and the tale of an underdog's rise to glory. But it's also a very personal, lived-in little movie, written and starring a struggling actor named Sylvester Stallone no one heard much of before (and refused more than $300,000 to give his role to an established star) and shot in an uncompromising and gritty way.<br/><br/>""Rocky"" today is a prisoner of its success. The first things about it most people remember are that it spawned a lot of weaker sequels (though Rockys II and III are still good films) along with Sylvester Stallone's career, which has had its share of misfires ('Cobra,' 'Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot,' 'Rhinestone'). They forget just how good the film is, how truthfully observed and comically well-pitched it is on the grim reality of life, mainly that most of us will die never realizing our deepest ambitions and desires.<br/><br/>""Rocky"" doesn't wallow in despair, though there is a sadness about the film, especially early on when we watch Rocky Balboa shake down losers for money and stop on the way home at the pet store window to wave at the sad little puppies who press their noses against the cold glass. Or the opening sequence, which is composed like a Depression-era painting, of Rocky and another boxer named Spider beating each other's brains out for a winner's share of $40.55. Spider's idea of post-fight conditioning is guzzling a beer, but when you're going nowhere in life, why bother? It's the kind of situation Paddy Chayefsky would breathe life into, and it's sort of ironic that 'Rocky' beat his ""Network"" for the Best Picture Oscar in 1977.<br/><br/>But ""Rocky"" has humor and humanity that compensates for the misery, even before a cracked third metacarpal robs Apollo Creed of his opponent for the New Year's fight and forces the champ to improvise fast. Like the scene where Rocky asks his friend Paulie (Burt Young) why Paulie's sister Adrian (Talia Shire) won't give him the time of day:<br/><br/>Paulie: Forget her! You're better than her...Adrian ain't sharp. Adrian's a freaking loser...She's gonna die alone.<br/><br/>Rocky: Hey, I don't see no crowd around you neither.<br/><br/>Rocky's courtship of Adrian is at first funny, then endearing, and finally intense. Their wordless makeout session at Rocky's doorway is all the better because it doesn't look pretty. Adrian is such an ugly duckling through the first half of the picture, you like Rocky all the more, loser that he is, for sticking with her through her painful shyness. (Her transformation into a more conventional beauty in the later Rockys is a key weakness of them.)<br/><br/>The second half of the film is the better half, though, because of the build-up to the fight, then the fight itself. Nothing is played the way film convention dictates. Rocky walks into the fight promoter's office thinking he's being offered a job as a sparring partner. When the promoter tells Rocky he's offering a shot at the title, Rocky is so incredulous he turns it down. Stallone underplays and underwrites this scene masterfully. His best line in the movie is probably a single word, when the promoter asks him if he believes America is the land of opportunity: ""Yeah."" And he half-swallows the word. But it's hard for this lifetime loser to believe his luck has changed, even if it means exposing himself to the world's most legally dangerous human.<br/><br/>There are some weaknesses, but very minor ones, like when we see Rocky tell Adrian he can't fool around with her before Mickey tells a protesting Rocky to lay off the kissyface. Most of what I see on repeat viewings are classic scenes that just get better, like Mickey's visit to Rocky's apartment and Paulie and Adrian's big yelling match after Paulie accuses Rocky of ""busting"" his sister. Meanwhile, the smaller moments get bigger also. I like the late Joe Spinell's performance as Rocky's loansharking boss Gazzo very much, as he invests the character with real charm and likability. He's patronizing, menacing, and you want better for Rocky, but if he is a villain, he's one in Rocky's corner.<br/><br/>'Rocky' also introduced us to the steadi-cam and some dynamite orchestral rock theme music that topped the charts in 1977. Mainly, though, it gave us one of the great film performances by Stallone, an actor who could play hungry because he was hungry, but could bring depth and warmth to bear as well, and a film that tells us the only real losers are those who give up on their dreams."

","I grew up when Stallone was making shallow stuff like ""Judge Dredd."" It was actually shocking to dive into his past and find that he had written and starred in ""Rocky,"" a film of such...well, beauty!<br/><br/>The novelty of ""Rocky"" is that the main character is truly good-hearted, a rarity for 70s films. He tries to take care of the people in his neighborhood (even the unappreciative ones who call him ""creepo!""), and his love for Adrian is pure and unwavering. He may be dumb, and he may be poor, but he's got honesty and guts and that's why he deserves to beat Apollo Creed, who's skilled but too blown up with his own hype.<br/><br/>Of course, Rocky doesn't beat Apollo in this movie, which is another reason why it's so good.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Those of you who have been desensitized by Rocky's sequels may well have forgotten just how good the original is. (Spoiler later but I'll warn you).<br/><br/>The original Rocky is, surprisingly, NOT about boxing. It is about a man who has dreams, has aspirations, but just can't make everything work. He lives in a squalid apartment, he barely makes enough to support himself, and people everywhere shun him, disregard his hopes and accomplishments, and call him a bum. His locker at the gym is unceremoniously given to someone viewed to have more talent, and a young neighborhood girl tells him to shove it after he tries his best to give her honest and heartfelt advice about staying away from the bad crowd.<br/><br/>It's not about boxing. Rocky Balboa is an everyman, a simple man who does his best to earn a living and takes cash from any source willing to give it to him. He wants a better life, he wants to be somebody, but the chance just isn't there.<br/><br/>The film, written by Stallone after being inspired by a similar story of a boxer, is sweet and low key. Its Philadelphia setting is very natural and doesn't have the glamour of typical Hollywood, and all performers do a fine job portraying characters that, in their own ways, are living lives of unfulfilled dreams and quiet desperation. Rocky has his eyes on the girl at the local pet store who's so shy that she's called retarded. Her brother, Rocky's only friend, is a boozehound. His boss is a cheap loan shark. And at the gym, the source of his only real interest, the owner seems to hate him.<br/><br/>Rocky's real chance comes when the well-known and flamboyant boxing champ sends him an offer to fight. What's sad about this is that while Rocky has genuine hope to utilize this chance and actually gain some self-respect and approval, in reality the champ just chose Rocky because he looked like a good candidate to boost his own image. This is all too apparent in one of the film's most symbolic scenes, when Rocky visits the empty auditorium where the fight will take place. The promoter is there, and Rocky points out that the giant poster hanging from the rafters features incorrect colors on Rocky's portrait. The promoter looks at it, shrugs, and explains that it doesn't matter, ""you'll give us a good show"".<br/><br/>This scene is quietly elegant, and encapsulates the feel of the movie as a whole. Whereas the other films in the series are more about Rocky's famous career, this one just lets us look at this poor guy who's just trying to BE somebody. And it's fitting that, by the end, (SPOILER ALERT: The film concludes with Rocky putting up one hell of a fight...And losing. But it doesn't matter. Rocky achieved what mattered most to him. He became somebody, he proved himself to the world, the champ, and even himself, and won the love of someone who really meant something to him. (END OF SPOILER)<br/><br/>The reason this film succeeds is because it isn't done with a heavy hand. It looks at Rocky sensitively, and we're along with him and can't help rooting for the poor guy. He's a good person, he deserves to make it. And as another reviewer pointed out, the soft directing is aided by the famous musical score, which envelopes us into all the emotions that these people are experiencing.  It's a very complete package, and although easily dismissable as a ""rags - to riches"" story, it's much more than that. It's all about someone trying to preserve their self esteem, trying to do what's right, and trying to simply win acceptance. Although I do still love the following four films, the original is where it's at. It's a sweet, honest drama about a man overcoming his obstacles, and it's great."

","This is probably one of the most well known movies of all time, and I finally got around to seeing this film some time earlier this year (2003).  I can't believe I consider myself a movie fan without having seen any of the films in the Rocky series.  I decided the time had come to remedy that situation.<br/><br/>To be honest, I thought ""Rocky"" was a fine movie, although I am surprised it won best picture.  These days, the chance of a film centering around a sport of any kind has virtually no chance of even getting nominated for an Oscar.  I guess that just shows how times have changed.<br/><br/>To my surprise, ""Rocky"" was a rather slow-paced film.  The beginning and the end are pretty exciting, but most of the film is full of dialogue and situations that lead up to the main event.<br/><br/>All of the actors in the film did a fine job with their roles.  Carl Weathers as the heavy- weight champion, Apollo Creed (what an awesome name!) is great.  Sylvester Stallone pulls off a rather nice performance, somewhat annoying at times, but I would credit that to the character, not the actor.  Burgess Meredith pulls off probably the best performance in the film.  Talia Shire and Burt Young are very good as well.<br/><br/>In the end, I'd say this was a good film, and certainly worth watching, for a number of reasons, but I wouldn't call it a must see.

It is the story of Rocky Balboa, a prizefighter of limited skill, but with the heart of a lion, who gets a shot at the heavyweight title. Sylvester Stallone, in his most famous role, plays Balboa to perfection and makes him one of the most loveable characters in movie history. The other actors are just as good and their characters just as memorable. Talia shire plays Rocky's shy, but always loyal girlfriend Adrian. Burt Young adds most of the laughs as Adrian's slimey brother Paulie. Carl Weathers is the fast talking heavyweight champ Apollo Creed.

Taxi Driver was also nominated that same year and should have perhaps won the Oscar but Rocky came at a time where America was recovering from Watergate and the war in Vietnam, and was looking for inspiration.

","OK, that's not strictly true, but it grabbed your attention. And while Raging Bull is most probably a better piece of film art than Rocky, it's the latter that holds the title in the enjoyment stakes. And although Rocky is essentially one great big cliche, as Appollo Creed says: ""A lot of other people are just as sentimental"". And it's true, we are. And Rocky manages to stay just the right side of sentimental to stay charming rather than mawkish.<br/><br/>Stallone's script is surprisingly effective for someone who later wrote Cliffhanger and who is traditionally painted as nothing more than a set of muscles and a mumble. However, Stallone's actual acting ability leaves much to be desired, and it takes Creed's rearranging of his facial features to shift his one expression into something else. But it can't detract from the fact that Rocky is extremely enjoyable hokum. It may not quite be what I think of as a deserving Oscar winner (maybe the competition was weak that year), but it is certainly more than worthy of the praise it receives from my action film loving friends."

","In 1976, a minor actor took a shot at creating something for himself and scored a knockout.  It's hard to remember; but, at this stage of his career, Sylvester Stallone was a relative unknown.  He had a small part in a Woody Allen film, and minor success in the movie The Lords of Flatbush.  The studio took a chance on a script from this minor actor and sat stunned as it became a huge success.  Gee, kind of sounds like the plot of the movie!<br/><br/>Rocky was not only the quintessential boxing movie, it was also the story of a man reaching for his dreams; and a surprisingly tender love story. Stallone was tailor-made for this part and he brings many layers to it. People often underestimate Stallone's intelligence and talent because of his voice and some of his career choices.  Rocky showed a Stallone with tremendous skills and promise.  Unfortunately, Stallone seemed to be more like Rocky at the beginning of the third film: living it up and taking the easy fights.  When Stallone is challenged, like in Cop Land, he can surprise you.<br/><br/>The film is filled with great character performances, including Burgess Meredith as the cranky trainer Mick, and Burt Young as the course, but caring Pauley.  Carl Weathers' Apollo is a cinematic Ali and makes a great contrast to Stallone's Rocky.<br/><br/>This movie is as much about emotion as it is about achieving your dreams. It takes you on a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, of happiness andÂ pain.  The soundtrack was everything that a movie score should be: if there were no dialogue or pictures, it could tell the story.  it ebbs and flows in time with the story.  It starts out slowly and builds and builds; and then swells to the emotional climax.  Your heart starts pumping along with it.<br/><br/>The movie gave us it's famous and often copied training montages.  They've become cliched, but they work so well in these movies.  We see Rocky struggle to build himself into the challenger.  With each step, he grows stronger and more confident.  In the end, he is standing tall.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Stallone went to the well one too many times.  He did the same with the Rambo films.  The first three Rocky's make a fine trilogy: The challenger who goes for the title and misses it by a hair, the rematch and the struggle to find the one element needed to capture the gold, and the downfall of the new champion and the rediscovery of what it took to rise to the top.  After that, the series is reduced to jingoism and caricature.  The same is true for Rambo.  In First Blood, he is a weary and lost veteran who is pushed to the breaking point.  In the subsequent films, he is just a cartoon supersoldier, blowing up tanks and helicopters with arrows and fighting armies alone.<br/><br/>There is talk of yet another Rocky and Rambo.  Hopefully, Stallone will let them stay retired and look for something more challenging.  You can never recapture lightning in a bottle.  You have to be satisfied with your accomplishment and move on to the next challenge.  This movie cannot be topped."

Even though Rocky had nothing to lose by fighting the champ (Apollo Creed) he had everything to gain like his dignity and self-worth. He found a new lover (Adrian) and the famous town boxing manager wanted to take Rocky under his wing. Things were looking better for Rocky and also his loan-shark boss contribute some ends for Rocky to prepare for the fight. It seems that everybody started to care about Rocky. The most thing I honored about Rocky is that he always had a good heart that's probably why people in his town supported him. Rocky was a man who care about people in his community like taking a ignorant young lady off the street late at night,brought a drunk inside the bar from which he passed out on the sidewalk,and cut a deal with a guy that owed his boss money. A real noble man. The only reason I see people neglecting Rocky because they feel such a good man could do much better for himself. Rocky is a true people's champion.

On top of the stairs there is a mold of his sneakers, really cool to see!  I have even gone to the Spectrum a few times to get some pictures of the ROCKY STATUE.  Oh yea and you can play as the ROCKY STATUE in the video game! You can also play as Mickey! I always look like a nut hanging from the ROCKY STATUE but oh well I am just ROCKY's biggest fan.  Oh and if you visit Philadelphia go to PATS STAKES home of the best cheese steaks in the world you will see that Sylvester Stallone was there and you will see ROCKY's name engraved in the front sidewalk!  Check it out!  In conclusion, even though this was a fictional character these movies defiantly pull you into a boxer's life that went from rags to riches.   I also like these movies because of the great training scenes.  If someone had to ask me what was my favorite ROCKY movie, I would have to say it is tied between ROCKY I and ROCKY IV, but for the best training and sound track I would have to pick ROCKY IV!

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Rocky was directed by John Avildsen; the writing is credited to Sylvester Stallone who also plays the main character Rocky Balboa.  The tagline for this film is: ` His whole life was a million to one shot!' Rocky is a lower class chump boxer from Philadelphia who tries to win over the heart of a local girl named Adrian.  Rocky is an average fighter who gets a once in a lifetime chance for the World heavyweight title against Apollo Creed.  The only thing that Rocky wants is to go the distance to prove to everyone that he is not a bum, and gain some respect.<br/><br/>Although Rocky is mainly a love story, I think the director gets the point across well.  Avildsen is trying to show that even though Rocky didn't win the fight, for being a million-to-one shot, he was able to go the distance showing that the underdog doesn't always lose, and can get the girl. I like the camera angles in this film the director moves you right up close to the action.  I like in the boxing scenes how the lighting is just right letting you see the sweat on the fighters, which made me feel as if I were one of the fighters.  There are only two boxing scenes in Rocky, so for those who are all about the fight this is not the movie for them.

","ROCKY tells a familiar rags-to-riches story that has that amazing thing about it that no matter how many times you've seen the film, it's always engaging, uplifting and hopeful. Sylvester Stallone wrote it while his acting career had slowly started becoming a dead-end, and he realized a story that reflected his own with Rocky ""The Italian Stallion"" Balboa, a promising small-time boxer that threw it all away and wanders the streets serving the local loan-shark as collector. Boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides to face off an unknown in his New Year bout and picks Rocky, which gives the Italian Stallion one last shot at glory. What Stallone truly understood while writing this film, is that to make such a fairy-tale work he had to capture it realistically, and it had to be captured emotionally. He and director John G. Avildson managed both; the dirty streets and corners of Philadelphia paints Rocky's character along his tender romance with Adrian (Talia Shire), his relationship with her brother Paulie (Burt Young) and his own grizzled coach Mickey (Burgess Meredith). ROCKY stands tall alongside Scorsese's RAGING BULL (1980) as the best boxing- film of all time."

","When you are watching a movie, what are the reason for doing so? Well I say it is for three reasons. One to entertain you, two to make you happy and thirdly (and I say the most important of all) to motivate you. That is what Rocky does, it motivates, and motivates in all aspects of it as well. Rocky is a very down and out sort of character, and film for that matter. I am sure many moviegoers could relate to this character, thus making Rocky the people's' sort of film.<br/><br/>Rocky is a Philadelphia club fighter who seems to be going nowhere, but as fate would have it, World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed chooses him to be his next opponent. For Creed, the match is little more than exhibition, but for Rocky it is a shot at the big time. While preparing for the bout under the watchful eye of his trainer Mickey, Rocky romances Adrian, a shy young woman who exposes the tenderness beneath his tough exterior. Their love blossoms as the fight approaches, giving Rocky even more strength and purposes to go the distance' against his brutal adversary.<br/><br/>
This film was a tremendous piece of cinematography in my view. Though it won an academy award for best picture at the Oscars, I believe it do so for more reasons than just because of the actual film. Sylvester Stallone has had a somewhat inconsistent career, but with this story, he proved that he had some sort of talent. His script was as powerful a story that I can remember watching. I am glad that we have a movie like this today because if we didn't, I truly believe we would be more the loser for it. Inventing a character such as Rocky Balboa, was ingenious, but then to actually play the lead title was magnificent.<br/><br/>As a viewer, I felt that Stallone was somewhat of an inexperienced actor back in 1976, and I am sure he would admit this to be the case. However, I feel that this made the Rocky character all the more endearing and someone who audiences could cheer with all their might for. Since the Rocky franchise, Stallone has done some good and bad work. Probably his other famous character would have to be  Rambo, where again his character steals the limelight, but proves that anything can be done!<br/><br/>His onscreen girlfriend, Adrian, was portrayed by Talia Shire. She was a great choice as the shy woman, who helps the hero out and also brings out his soft side. Their onscreen relationship for me was really impressive, as they show people how a real relationship should work. That being the case, the final scene of this Rocky is so pivotal, as it has Rocky and Adrian wanting to be with each other, though most fighters would be more worried about the result of the fight. <br/><br/>Rocky's trainer Mickey, was played by legend actor Burgess Meredith. I remember him in the TV series of Batman, as the notorious Penguin. However I feel that his role in Rocky was incredible, showing movie fans how good an actor he is. Rocky's opponent in the ring was Apollo Creed who was performed by Carl Weathers. His character was very cocky and confident, showing that he only wants to fight the `Italian Stallion' for the fun of it. He was in for a horrible shock when he steps into the ring. Weathers has been in movies such as Predator, Little Nicky and Happy Gilmore. One character that I found to be a little peculiar in this movie, was Adrian's brother Paulie, acted by Burt Young. He was a very rude and arrogant person, who takes advantage of his sister and his friend, whether it be for his lifestyle or his pocket. <br/><br/>There are many poignant scenes in Rocky, none more so than when Rocky and his trainer Mickey are talking in his apartment. They are both very scared to commit to each other, however when Rocky believes Mickey has left and realises he hasn't, the tough man just retreats back into his bathroom. Many of the scenes that Rocky has with Adrian are fundamental to what happens to Rocky in the ring. I especially love the scene when Rocky makes a move on Adrian. The fight between Apollo and Rocky is also well shot and gives the audience the feeling that they are actually there watching the bout.<br/><br/>So, there is not much more I can say about one of the 70's most powerful movies, as it is up there with movies such as Star Wars, Superman American Graffiti, One who flew over the Cuckoo's nest and the scary Jaws. Rocky is a character, that I am sure everyone could relate to, whether it is playing a sport, working in a job or studying at school, as his dedication to being the best he could be is inspirational. The musical score that Rocky has is as powerful as the Italian Stallion' himself, with it being known all over the world. If you can not take something away from this award-winning movie than you are not a true movie lover! <br/><br/>Rating: 4.5 Stars or 9.5 out of 10"

","The sequels (though at times entertaining) to this movie, along with the coterminous ""Rambo"" series, almost made this crtitcally acclaimed, truly great film a joke.  They also nearly ruined the premise of this original, that of a middling fighter, albeit with voluminious heart, takes his one shot at glory and catches a much more talented man off gaurd.  In the subsequent movies Balboa becomes a ""great"" boxer, and we lose one of the most endearing characters in film history.  This egregious example confirms that sequels are self-serving and spoil the imagination of viewers of the orginal work.<br/><br/>The main reason that this work is so moving is the character development of the title character.  From his inept attempts at loanshark enforcement and romance, to his moments alone in his seedy apartment staring in the mirror, talking to his pets, to the advice given to the young girl, we find this man of violence very appealing. His development (and pari passu transformation of Adrian-played brilliantly by Shire) culminates in the poignant moment when he reveals to Adrain that though he knows he cannot win, if he can just go the distance he'll know that he wasn't ""just another bum from the neighborhood"".  And go the distance he does--in one of the greatest fight sequences ever made.<br/><br/>Other plusses:  The inspiring theme song which swells perfectly as he accends the steps, the intersting love story, and the fabulous acting of Shire, Young, Weathers and Meredith.<br/><br/>A great film."

","I don't think the film ""Rocky"" is as appreciated in todays society as it is deserved to be. It's an amazing film with a fine story and some amazing characters. The film has been ridiculed and made fun as the years went on, made into a cliche', except by those who remember its purity and substance when it was first released or those movie enthusiasts who appreciate fine theatrical work.<br/><br/>Rocky, a down and out boxer from the streets of Philadelphia, surrounded by poverty and scorn, who falls in love with a local girl and finds himself in the fight of his life against the champion of the world. Seems like such a simple premise, yet so much was happening between all it's characters, that the film never got dull or over the top.<br/><br/>Stallone out did himself and surprised everyone, him included, when he delivered this outstanding performance. How could you not root for this guy and feel his despair and pain as his life was happening.<br/><br/>
His supporting cast was nothing short of excellent. A great mix of very different characters. A drunk, loud, jealous brother. An extremely shy yet very loving woman. An over the top glory hungry champ. An old disgruntled and still living his dream boxing trainer.<br/><br/>I don't think people appreciate the very real fact that it only took Stallone a few days to write this script or how he had to fight the studios to let him play the lead. How different this film would have turned out if another actor played the lead. We are more fortunate for it.<br/><br/>Will Stallone ever play a finer role than Rocky? Probably not. He was ""Rocky"" in every way possible and it was amazing for him to have let us, the viewers, experience that for ourselves."

","It is a travesty that this film suffers the stigma of several grossly inferior sequels. If we can pretend for just one moment that we live in a world free of Rocky II - V, we can admire a true piece of cinematic mastery. Rocky is a story worth telling. To suggest that this film is merely a story of a chump fighter's shot at respect in the bigger and brighter world, is to only scratch the surface of what makes Rocky truly great. Rocky Balboa represents the plight of second generation immigrants everywhere, struggling to survive in a society which has yet to accept them. Set in the Philadelphia Italian ghettos, Rocky explores the lives and hardships of the people around him aswell as Balboa's own. In this case Rocky's opportunity becomes a chance for one man to raise the spirit of an entire people' and is beautifully depicted in the famous running scene. It is testimony to the fact that one act can breakdown barriers and that the human spirit can turn survival into prosperity. Brilliantly acted and with an awesome musical score, Rocky is a must for any worthy Film collection."

","It's hard to believe that it's been twenty-five years since the original ROCKY played in movie theatres!  By now, most people know about the behind-the-scenes story that was just as interesting as what happened on the screen:  Sylvester Stallone was a character actor who was having a hard time finding roles.  Till then, his biggest part has been as one of THE LORDS OF FLATBUSH.  With a pregnant wife and little money in the bank, Stallone wrote a screenplay about a down-on-his-luck heavyweight boxer who gets a million-to-one shot at the championship of the world.  When he pitched his story to United Artists, such names as Robert DeNiro, Ryan O'Neal and Burt Reynolds were brought up to play the lead.  But Stallone was adamant about one thing:  Either he played Rocky Balboa or he would destroy the script. The studio relented and a classic was made.<br/><br/>     In fact, when the cameras began rolling on the movie, only two of its cast were well-known:  Burgess Meredith (Mickey) and Talia Shire (Adrian). Stallone and the others were seen as something of a risk, one that eventually paid off BIG.<br/><br/>     ROCKY opens shortly before Thanksgiving, 1975.  Rocky Balboa (Stallone) is a boxer so hard-scrabble that he has to bum a cigarette from an audience member right after one of his fights.  In addition to boxing, Rocky also works as the enforcer for a low-level loan shark (Joe Spinell), a profession that doesn't sit well with Mickey Goldmill (Meredith).  Goldmill runs the gym where Rocky trains and he feels that what Rocky is doing is ""a waste of life"".  So much so that he kicks Rocky out of his gym locker for a boxer that he feels is a true contender.  At the same time, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), the heavyweight boxing champion of the world, is up a creek:  the opponent for his New Year's fight has to pull out due to injury.  No other ranked contender is available.  What to do?  Creed hits on an idea:  give a local fighter a title shot.  Creed picks Rocky because he feels heat from Balboa's nickname:  ""The Italian Stallion"".  ""Who discovered America?"" Creed asks, ""An Italian, right?  What could be better than to get it on with one of his descendents?""<br/><br/>     While all of this is going on, Rocky is trying to capture the attention of Adrian (Shire), the woman at the local pet shop and the sister of his best friend, Paulie (Burt Young).  Adrian is so shy that some people think that she's retarded.  Looking at Rocky trying to break down her defenses during their courtship is almost like watching him in the ring.  You have to admire his tenacity.  While he pursues a romantic relationship with Adrian, Paulie is constantly hitting Rocky up for a job with the loan shark or trying to make money off of Rocky's name after he gets the title shot.  This also gets the attention of Mickey, who now feels that Rocky has a chance to make something of his life.<br/><br/>     Meanwhile, the champ is portrayed as so pushy that he makes Muhammad Ali (the real champ at the time of the movie's release) look humble.  Not only that, he's something of a racist as well (""[Rocky's] Italian, ain't he?"" he says of his opponent, ""Which means if he can't fight, I'll bet he can cook."").  The perfect counterbalance to the truly mild-mannered (by comparison) Rocky.  The courtship between Rocky and Adrian is shown in a very sweet way.  The fight itself is one of the best ever committed to film. To say who wins would be redundant to those of us who have already seen it and spoiling of the excitement to those of you who haven't.  Just watch it for yourself and enjoy it.<br/><br/>          As it turned out, the movie as a whole became a ""contender"":  It received ten Oscar nominations, winning three (Best Director, Film Editing and Picture).  ROCKY beat out such cinematic ""heavyweights"" as NETWORK, ALL OF THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and TAXI DRIVER.  Enhancing the movie is Bill Conti's great musical score which includes the song which became as much of a character as the human actors:  ""Gonna Fly Now"".  In fact, after watching ROCKY, I wonder if, like me, others often find the music ""Going the Distance"" playing in the back of their minds whenever they watch a real boxing match.  Especially a good match."

","One of my all time favorite films.  Well deserving of the best picture Oscar, despite what film snobs would say.  This film touched the simple theme of redemption, of reclaiming self-respect, at a time when the US was in a similar state of rebuilding its self image after the embarrassments of Vietnam and Watergate.  It clearly explains why the movie was a box office smash, how the theme song rang on every radio station, and the image of Rocky reaching the top steps of the Philly Art Museum became a classic image of achievement and victory.  Those who disagreed with the Academy's award choice are either too young or were too sheltered to understand the impact this film had at that time in American culture (vs Taxi Driver which was a GREAT film--also a personal favorite--but it had much less impact for most people).  Shot on the dark, grey, run-down streets of Philadelphia and chock full of real, gritty dialogue and characters, it shows you the tired and discouraging life of the average man, how he compromises, makes bad decisions, and wastes his ""life"" in order to survive.  Rocky understands he has become just another ""bum"", and realizes his dreams of becoming a successful boxer are evaporating, as is his self-respect.  But later in a flukey stroke of luck, Apollo Creed, the heavyweight champion, decides to find a gimmick to avoid cancelling a scheduled holiday bout.  He will give a ""no-name"" the chance to fight for the title, and he chooses Rocky as his gimmick.  Rocky is given his shot at redemption, and in an inspired move by writer Stallone, Rocky has the insight to know he doesn't have the ability to win this fight, but he makes a personal decision about what he can do to prove his own worth.  If he can just ""go the distance"" and can still stand after the fight is over, he realizes he has done something that no other person has ever done (Apollo is undefeated, all other contenders have been KO'd), and for once he will know he isn't ""just another bum"". <br/><br/>
A very loud ""BOO/HISS"" to Stallone for abandoning this idea later in the Rocky sequels.  The story of Rocky was complete and real, the sequels are what have made people cynical of the original story.  Had Stallone left it alone it would have stayed a classic in everyone's eyes.

","Cornball?  Sure.  Sugary and sentimental?  Oh yeah.  And unashamedly so. But this film has so many genuinely touching moments, so many little insights into the way human beings operate, that you end up not only being touched, but instructed by it.  I think of Rocky's attempts to lure Adrian to him.  He's an open book who shares everything.  She shares nothing. But he keeps chipping away because he sees something in her that no one else does.  Or the moment when he realizes he can't beat Apollo Creed, that he's been living in a dream world.  So he chooses another goal.  Or when Burgess Meredith's character offers his services as manager and Rocky spews all this pent up anger for so many slights over the years.  But then, he relents. Not because he wants to, but because he has to.  These are the moments that make this film wonderful, and there are a ton of them.  Far more than most any film you're likely to see.  But I also didn't find the plot that far-fetched.  If Apollo Creed was modeled on Ali (and he was) then we have to think back to the Ali of that era.  A larger-than-life, supremely arrogant individual who was thoroughly capable of the sort of bombast that Apollo Creed displays.  He would have his fight on Independence Day.  He would fight the Italian Stallion, showing his humanity by giving an unknown a chance at the title.  Sure.  It works.  I've certainly suspended a lot more disbelief than that during the course of a movie.<br/><br/>So many little moments than ring true.  That's what set this movie apart in 1976 despite it's sentimental nature.  And those moments are why it's still a terrific movie today."

Stallone's performance was good, but not Oscar-worthy. All of the other characters play secondary roles in the film and don't really make a huge impact maybe with the exception of Mickey (Burgess Meredith). Perhaps if we had seen more interaction between Mickey and Rocky instead of a lot of wasted time following Rocky around Philadelphia, the movie would have been that much better.<br/><br/>I found the final fight scene in this film to be somewhat fake, because all of the boxing is pure offence. Rocky takes a turn beating on Creed and vise versa. Creed also seems unscathed after the 15 round match whereas Rocky doesn't look like the same Rocky that entered the ring. The film ends rather abruptly which I think was a very smart move.

","Since its initial release ROCKY has been elevated to cinematic myth.  And four sequels later, it may be easy to forget ROCKY'S roots.  But this gentle tale of an Italian southpaw from the Philadelphia slums is worth returning to.  An old fashioned story about the potential for every underdog to achieve greatness.  Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay in only ten days, when he was little more than a bit performer in low budget films, and its success led him to become one of the most recognized movie stars in the world.  His quiet unassuming portrayal of the Italian Stallion, an innocent boxer who gets a shot at the heavyweight title of the world is always intensely moving.  A film that is both edgy and sensitive at the same time, ROCKY is every guy's STEEL MAGNOLIAS.  And for anyone who's had to fight for what they believe in, it is guaranteed to draw a tear."

","In 1976, the United States was needed a wake-up call.  With Vietnam, dissolution with Government, Civil Unrest weighing heavily on our minds, Life imitated Art.  Rocky brought us the story of the American Dream, only coincidentally scripted through the canvas of the boxing ring.  Unlike few movies before, and even future later, ""Rocky"" presented its' gravitas through virtue, triumph, work ethic, and even religiosity.<br/><br/>
Critics of the film bark at Rocky out of frustration for its' unprecedented success: How could a nobody, Sylvester Stallone, leverage his film career, write and star in a movie that could possibly beat the heavily favored, then-industry beefed stalwart ""Network"" at the Oscars?  1976, the year of the Bicentennial, also just so happened to be the year of the upset.  No, Rocky didn't win the fight--but if he had, the film would have failed to deliver on its' true premise.  The fighting was metaphor for life.  Bill Conti's musical score rings as loudly as any ever made for a motion picture, a quarter-century later.  The film's dignity was in the humility of its' roots.  The fighter may have lost in the the film, but the motion picture when on to take top honors, winning best picture--in arguably one of the biggest Oscar upsets in history.<br/><br/>Movies can often be judged by their children, and grandchildren...pictures that are inspired or born from a theme or formula from the original.  If that were the sole criterion for which movies were judged, Rocky would be considered one of the greatest films ever made."

"fugu_286","10","0","0","12 March 2002"," Not So Far Fetched...
","I have heard people question the plausibility of this film and I had to say something. Back when this film was made, there was mostly one boxing champion in each weight division. There was, for example, one middleweight champion, one heavyweight champion. The days of numerous sanctioning bodies each claiming their own champion had not yet come. In this sense it was a matter of PRESTIGE for a fighter to hold a championship. And before the days of guaranteed multi-million dollar contracts, a champion might have taken on ""all comers"" to try and cement his reputation. A case in point would be when Joe Louis fought Tony ""Two Ton"" Galento, a short stout and overweight beer salesman. Galento was a 30-1 underdog although he did manage to knock Louis down before getting cut to ribbons. Muhammad Ali often defended his title against no-namers like Jean-Pierre Coopman and Brian London.<br/><br/>
Now back to the film. Although the fight scene is remarkably over-the-top (if you want to see realistic fights, go see ""Girlfight""), it goes against the grain of your typical underdog movie, because Rocky LOSES. It appears that Apollo is the better overall fighter but Rocky's got the heart to go the distance. This adds credibility to the film (which the sequels destroy) even though it isn't REALLY a boxing film.<br/><br/>Also the Rocky character is based on two real-life fighters. Obviously, Rocky Marciano, who used to train in meat lockers, and Chuck Wepner who was served up to Muhammad Ali so he could have two or three easy rounds. Wepner (a liquor salesman who ""wanted to go the distance"") gave Ali 15 tough rounds before getting knocked out literally at the last minute."
"lmeltzer","Null","0","0","13 February 2002"," Going the Distance
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** After reviewing many of the comments already left for this movie, I felt I had to offer my two cents. As a Philadelphia native, this movie has always held a little extra appeal for me, so I disclose that fact at the outset. Personal bias not withstanding, however, ""Rocky"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am probably not your typical ""Rocky"" fan- for one thing, I'm not a fan of Sylvester Stallone, I am a woman, and I was born after the movie made its debut. In spite of all of those factors, I love this movie and have seen it countless times.<br/><br/>As one reviewer pointed out, ""Rocky"" is not a ""boxing movie."" The comments regarding how ""Rocky"" is just another underdog-wins-big sap fest clearly do not remember the film that well, or perhaps are thinking of one of the many sequels. In most movies celebrating the underdog, the protagonist sets out to prove to the world that he is capable of greatness and triumphs. By contrast, Rocky has nothing to prove to anyone but himself. Rocky does not fight for the recognition of others- he fights (literally and metaphorically) for self-respect.<br/><br/>Rocky learns to respect himself and, in a not unrelated side-effect, earns the respect of others. Rocky, who has never ""applied himself"" in any endeavor, learns that for others to respect him, he has to respect himself. That concept manifests itself in a boxing match and the ""training"" that leads up to it. On one level, Rocky trains his previously neglected body for the ""big event."" On another level, and the far more interesting one, Rocky trains his previously neglected self-concept and learns that he is worthy and capable of the respect of others, as well as of self-respect.<br/><br/>Both training endeavors develop in the context of the relationships Rocky pursues. First, we see the relationship between Rocky and his trainer, Mickey. Mickey has written off Rocky, as evidenced by a great scene where Rocky shows up to train only to find that Mickey has given his locker to a new boxer. Mickey regularly calls his student a ""bum"" and it is clear he has no faith in Rocky's abilities to do anything other than break thumbs and bust noses for his loan-shark employer. Mickey does not want anything to do with Rocky until he sees an opportunity to capitalize on Rocky's chance to fight Apollo Creed (lucky for Rocky, since noone else was lining up for the job). Rocky clearly believes Mickey's assessment of both his fighting prospects and internalizes the message of the father-figure to his life prospects as well. (Mickey tells him ""you're a waste of life.""). Mickey is a bitter-old man who feels he missed his chance to be a great fighter and wants to attach himself to a winner- he does not see Rocky as his ideal match. However, fate is such that Rocky is the one who will give Mickey the chance to have a moment in the spotlight and to feel success.<br/><br/>Another interesting relationship is that of Rocky and mousy pet-store worker Adrian. Adrian also won't give Rocky the time of day, however, it is not because she feels he is a ""bum."" It is because she, too, doubts her worth. As we later find out, Adrian's mother once told her something to the effect ""You better develop your brains, 'cause you don't have much of a body."" Rocky was once given a similar piece of ""wisdom"" by his father who said ""You better develop your body, 'cause you sure didn't get much of a brain."" Adrian, however, sees in Rocky something she doesn't see in herself- power and determination. It is only through her relationship with Rocky that she eventually stands up for herself to her alcoholic brother, Paulie. At the same time, with Adrian's approval, Rocky learns to have faith in himself, and she gives him the strength (ironically) that he needs to get into the ring with the champ.<br/><br/>The most interesting relationship in the movie occurs between Rocky and Paulie. Paulie works at a meat packing plant, where Rocky sometimes ""trains"" by pounding slabs of beef. Paulie is a truly pathetic figure, an alcoholic who is cared for by his sister who latches on to Rocky, another loser. It is when Rocky has a chance at success, a prospect that continually eludes Paulie, that Paulie erupts and confronts his friend, addressing feelings of abandonment and rejection. He is a tragic figure, and the perfect dramatic foil. It is not hard to imagine Rocky in such a context 20 years down the line unless he capitalizes on the opportunity to make a good showing for himself.<br/><br/>The reason these relationships are so pivotal to the movie is because they contribute to Rocky's development. When Rocky, rejected by Mickey (also a father-figure) learns of his opportunity to fight for the championship, he assumes that Apollo Creed just wants an easy mark. Ever the realist, Rocky has no delusions of beating Creed. However, Rocky realizes that this is his chance, and probably his only chance, to show those in his life, including himself, that he is worthy of their time and respect. Rocky does not want to be just another ""bum from the neighborhood,"" and while he fights Creed physically, he is battling the demons of complacency, failure and mediocracy at the same time. To overcome the internal struggle, Rocky does not need to overcome Creed- he merely needs to show himself that he is good enough to be a contender. Noone suspects, for a moment, that Rocky could win the physical match as well.<br/><br/>One point which is often overlooked is that Rocky LOSES the big fight. Creed wins by a decision. However, Rocky ""wins"" in the sense that he has proven to himself that he can make a respectable showing for himself if he works hard and is dedicated. He has also earned the respect of Mickey and Adrian. For Rocky, the fight was not for the championship - it was for respect and self-respect. And while he lost the boxing match, he won the bigger fight and thus has ""won"" regardless of the outcome.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine someone not liking this movie. The characters are real people, not likeable so much as familiar, not sympathetic as much as tragic, not winners so much as people who've found acceptance within and with others. One is far more likely to identify with Rocky than with Rambo- every day, people feel the struggle to earn and maintain self-respect amid others who doubt their abilities and perseverance. No one wins every battle, but so long as a good showing is made, the battle may be lost, but the war is won.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie to all but the most literal-minded movie-viewer. The movie is subtle in its many layers of appeal. The performances are not ""over the top"" but quiet, reflective and pensive. The script is realistic, never fabricated (one of my favorite scenes, in fact, is one with no words, where Rocky and Mickey share an embrace in the street below). While contrived, the plot does not require suspension of disbelief. Most importantly, the themes of the movie are conveyed subtly and effectively, but never spelled out. It is strange to think of a movie set around the gritty worlds of boxing and slums and ""subtle"" but the performances really excel in that regard.<br/><br/>5/5 stars. I have actually just put myself in the mood to watch the movie again."

","While this was the first movie I ever saw in the theater, I was more of a fan of III and IV in my younger days due to the faster pace and more aggressive nature.  But they pale in comparison to the original now.  A classic movie, instantly making Stallone a star and introducing the ""feel good"" movie for a new generation (which may or may not be a good thing). The movie has such a genuine feel - much like ""Good Will Hunting"", it gives a seemingly accurate glimpse into urban blue collar life.  The music is also masterfully done... of course the main theme is immediately recognizable (and if it doesn't get your heart rate up, you must be comatose), but the supporting music creates a wonderful ambience... the music Rocky plays on his turntable, the lone french horn theme as he begins his training, the a capella group in the beginning - it's all classic."

To its credit, the production credits are top notch. Talia Shire's performance was worthy of an Oscar nomination, it is for the most part well directed (until, ironically, the final scene) and... and that's about it. Even the very theme song itself was one where people wanted to stomp you if you said you didn't care for it. The recording somehow manages to be not only bombastic, it is threatening at the same time (actually, a bit of an accomplishment). It defies you dislike it. And finally, while there are some iconic images in it...(particularly, the poster) some of those are still of short of merit. It is my understanding that in Philadelphia, there is some sort of monument to the title character jumping for joy on top of the lengthy steps.

","File this one under the ""I finally get what everyone is talking about"" section of movies I have waited too long to see. Now I understand why people scream ""yo, Adrian"", or why my friends burst into a run up the stairs at the Lincoln Memorial on our class trip to D.C. It took Oscar month for me to see the 1976 Best Picture Winner, starring Sylvester Stallone, directed by John G. Avildsen. I had some preconceived biases about this film. I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, a film also nominated for the Academy's top prize in 1976. I am also a fan of another film that was up for the top prize that year, Network. Since I enjoy these other films so much, I have shunned Rocky throughout the years believing my favorite (Taxi Driver) to have been brutally snubbed. Regardless of my feelings, it was time to see Rocky, and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a simpleton, working for a loan shark and boxing part-time with a local gym. He is enamored with Adrian (Talia Shire), the equally simple-minded sister of Paulie (Burt Young), a friend of Rocky's from his neighborhood. As much as he wants to be, Rocky is not proving himself as a fighter. He is losing matches and performing so poorly that he has gotten the locker he has occupied for 6 years taken away by gym owner, Mickey (Burgess Meredith). With a brilliant stroke of luck, heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) visits Rocky's home state of Philadelphia. While he is there, his manager's set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, promoting the event as a way for ""a nobody to become a somebody"". They choose the most desperate opponent for Creed when they select Rocky. Dejected and seeing this fight as his one big chance to finally achieve his dream as a prize fighter, Rocky gets a manager in Mickey and starts intensive training in hopes of achieving a huge upset over Creed.<br/><br/>Rocky told a great story and was filmed in such a perfectly gritty way that related well to the titular character's plight. I wish there could have been a little more character development of the boxer, but based on the ending of this film, it seemed as though the director/producers already knew there was to be a sequel in the works. Perhaps Rocky II sheds a little more light on the intricacies of the boxer; I'll have to check that out. Chemistry was exactly what it should have been. Rocky kept an emotional distance from everyone, therefore, everyone maintained emotional distance from Rocky. The acting was true to character and believable. I can't say enough good things about the cinematography of this film. I truly miss the days where every movie was shot on film; I'm definitely not a fan of digital.<br/><br/>I am happy to have seen Rocky. It is a cultural phenomenon, with another movie in the series being released just last year. Rocky also proved to be a very well-done film, regardless of my reservations over Sylvester Stallone's acting. As good as Rocky was, I have not wavered from my personal assessment that Taxi Driver should have bagged Scorsese his first statuette. Taxi Driver was a better, more developed film, but for a different audience. But hey, now I can say ""yo Adrian"" along with the masses now."

They needed a movie like this to provide them inspiration and hope in their daily lives.<br/><br/>What unfortunately lacks subtlety is the execution of the performances of the cast especially by Sylvester Stallone inspite of his Oscar nomination for Best Actor.Many critics and fans have considered him the next Marlon Brando but unfortunately that is far from the truth at present.He definitely was a movie star for so many year due to the many films he made that made millions and not because of his acting abilities.But nevertheless,after watching this movie,I could fairly say that this was the best performance of this career.The other stars in the movie were decent.<br/><br/>As for the legacy of this movie,it was not only well-known to be the greatest movie about underdogs.The music of Bill Conti especially the classic Rocky theme,""Gonna Fly Now"" has not only been identified to Rocky but also to the sport of boxing.Arguably the it has maintained the popularity of boxing for so many years especially when Conti's music is played in boxing matches.Aside from that,Rocky gave way to many movie sequels such as Rocky's II,III,IV,V and Rocky Balboa - all that never came close to this movie.

Burt Young as Paulie, (Adrian's sister) plays a very bitter character as a abusively angered brother who always likes to yell. Burgess Meredith, as Rocky's bitter and broken down mentor, Mickey, is one of the most classic and greatest performances of all time. Mickey is an icon of movies, and he just completes the drama in the Rocky movies.<br/><br/>The build up to the fight is also amazing, for you are rooting for Rocky all the way, and seeing him tense and nervous, just makes you wanna see him go all the way. Although the opponent, Apollo Creed, (Carl Weathers) isn't considered a bad guy, you still wanna see Rocky beat him down.<br/><br/>The film is the absolute classic underdog film that is brilliant to no end.

""Network"",""All The President's Men"",""Taxi Driver"" and the lesser known ""Bound For Glory"". <br/><br/>The story of Rocky is much like a story many people deal with everyday. Trying not just to make something of ourselves in this life ...... but to become something better and more meaningful than we already are or that we may not be at that time. <br/><br/>I feel this was the reason it won the top Award at the Oscars. The top 3 that I mentioned were movies showing what was wrong in our country,which is always important ground to cover and all 3 are brilliant and classics. (I've never seen Bound For Glory,so I can't comment.) <br/><br/>Anyone of them could have taken the prize but the Academy simply went a different way. At least (again) that's how I see it. I have nothing negative to say about Rocky as a movie,it's simplistically wonderful and the climax is unforgettable.<br/><br/>I only have trouble with the DVD's overloaded with far too many ""extras"". Don;t get me wrong , I like extras,like deleted scenes. ...but why not take these deleted scenes and put them back in the movie and onto the DVD itself? <br/><br/>Also,if I recall correctly,the fight used to be a lot longer and seems to be edited to be shorter and quicker. Why? To cater to those with short attention spans?<br/><br/>I did some detective work online to see about a scene where Rocky talks to a priest before the fight and found that this occoured in Rocky 2,not this one. <br/><br/>Anyhow,10 stars for ""Rocky"" for the great little film that won over the Academy and the nation. If I rated the DVD features that come with this,it'd be a 9. (END)"
"kirk-246","10","1","2","30 June 2009"," Rocky is still fighting.
","For a 1976 drama,'Rocky' is a very well done movie about a boxer who is given a chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world.Sylvester Stallone plays Rocky,Burt Young plays Paulie,Talia Shire plays Adrien,and Carl Weathers plays Apollo Creed,the heavyweight champion of the world.As you can tell,there is a pretty decent cast,which helps this movie become a knockout.There are also some pretty good boxing scenes,some of them are brutal for a PG rating,but it still keeps me entertained.Here is one of my favorite lines of the entire movie.This one is from Burgess Meredith.<br/><br/>""You're going to eat lightning and crap thunder"""
"Aaron1375","7","1","2","7 March 2009"," Of the Rocky's probably the most realistic.
","This movie was a rather good drama starring Sylvester Stallone as the title character Rocky. It also is one of those movies that has a theme that sticks with a person because it is so memorable. The movie, too is memorable although kind of slow moving in places as well. They try a bit to hard making Rocky seem real, showing a bit to many details of his courtship of Adrien, though I have to say that these scenes while slow help with the ending making it a bit more emotional. The story, the heavy weight champion of the world Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is about to fight a title bout. Well the person he is supposed to fight drops out so Apollo decides to fight an unknown guy and picks a local named Rocky. Rocky is a bit of a washed up fighter, he can win but he does so clumsily. The trainer who I think owns the gym, Mickey, decides to help Rocky train for this fight and these two opposing forces meet in the ring for more of a fight than Apollo was expecting. This fight is a bit more realistic than the fight in two in that Apollo was not taking this fight seriously at all and was not training hard. An underdog that he had never really seen before could have taken him by surprise the way Rocky did here. So a good fight sequence a some filler before then to pull at the heart strings and inspire one. Still good though for a sports movie."

"gavin6942","8","1","2","3 October 2007"," An Inspirational Film About People Who Don't Talk Right
","Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is an amateur boxer. He's a good fighter, maybe even a great fighter, but he's never gone professional and is starting to get old. Then one way on a whim, the champion of the world (Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers) calls him out to a fight. With some training and the help of a montage and a plain-jane girlfriend (Adrian, played by Talia Shire), maybe Rocky just might win. This is his story.<br/><br/>Rocky's an undeniable classic. Heck, he's got six movies out now and maybe someday a seventh (though I would really doubt that). Anything I say wouldn't matter because it's been said by everyone else over the past thirty-one years. So, instead, I'll just say what I feel like.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Talia Shire's performance. Being the shy, simple girlfriend was a nice departure for her from ""The Godfather"". Sure, maybe it seems like a useless role, but she's quite crucial to the plot when you see how she supports Rocky and also causes a wedge between Rocky and his best friend Paulie (Adrian's brother). So she was cool, and I liked how she became more attractive as the film went on and her esteem went up.<br/><br/>Apollo Creed is a great villain. He's not necessarily a bad guy -- he may, in fact, be very nice. But he is an obstacle to glory and must be overcome, whether he deserves to be or not. Someone someday would do it -- why not Rocky? It was also nice to see Michael Dorn (best known as Star Trek's Worf) as one of his bodyguards.<br/><br/>What else? The meat-packing scenes were cool, and an interesting training method. The iconic stairs scene was okay, but not as powerful as homages let on. Lloyd Kaufman shows up as a drunk, which is awkward but fun. And we have the classic song ""Gonna Fly Now"" that tells us ""hey, Rocky's really getting pumped. Like super-pumped. You better not make him angry"".<br/><br/>If you haven't seen ""Rocky"", see it. I went over 26 years without seeing a ""Rocky"" film just because I never had a good reason to see one. And although I can't offer a good reason for you to see one either, the bottom line is this is a good film. As for the sequel, I don't know yet... you'll have to wait for future reviews..."
"Cocacolaguy912-2","Null","1","2","10 April 2007"," Incredible how it makes you feel.
","I mean ""incredible"" in terms of how inspiring, unique, motivational, moving, and triumphant this movie is. Rocky is nothing short of an excellent movie. The first thing to mention is Rocky himself. Rocky Balboa is no doubt one of the greatest characters in film history. His is an icon, a symbol, a figure. He is the definition of a ""person with heart."" The other thing that really stands out in this movie is the song, ""Gonna Fly Now"" shown during Rocky's training montages. The song is perfect. I consider the scene where he is running up the stairs to be one of the best scenes in a movie ever. Rocky would not be what it is without that perfect tune. The rest of the music is also great - whether it be the emotionally draining theme for ""Adrian"", his wife, or the ending theme after the fight.<br/><br/>It is just incredible how ""Rocky"" makes you feel. It stays with you. The more I think about this movie, the more I like it."
"duraflex","10","1","2","25 March 2007"," Tough man with a tender heart
","There was something very genuine and likable about this character when Stallone created ROCKY in 1976.<br/><br/>Young Rocky could fight like a bat out of hell but he had a tender side toward animals, children and the homely girl that worked in the pet store near the gym where he worked out.<br/><br/>This was a character we quickly came to care about. He wasn't evil and he didn't have an agenda to use people. He just wanted to be somebody.<br/><br/>It's a lesson in humility and perseverance and ultimately achievement.<br/><br/>If you only ever see one ROCKY, this is the one to watch. Rocky 2 and 3 are also good. Rocky 4 and 5 - not as good as the others."

","""Rocky"" is probably the most heartwarming movie I've had the chance to view. I absolutely love the characters that Sly Stallone has created in the ""Rocky"" universe, and the first movie is certainly the best. The romance between Rocky and Adrian is genuine, and I find myself smiling throughout every scene they have together. They're definitely one of the great movie couples of all-time.<br/><br/>The actual fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed has a very real presence, and Rocky's training sequence is as memorable as everyone says it is. Bill Conti's music is iconic and for good reason. The film might not be the perfect boxing/sports movie as ""Raging Bull"" proved just a few years later, but ""Rocky"" still packs a punch and has its place in movie history."
"dee.reid","10","1","2","21 February 2007"," You'll love it the first time you see it...
","...Which is ironic for me to say that because I'll admit the first time I saw the original 1976 ""Rocky,"" I wasn't all that impressed. Maybe it was because of Sylvester Stallone, his hammy Oscar-nominated role as the ""underdog"" boxer Rocky Balboa, or its lack of in-the-ring action (which is saved for the last 20 minutes) - I don't know, and I'm not sure I'll ever know. The point is, after a lot of soul-searching and realizing that ""Rocky"" is the real deal (plus a convenient chance at re-watching the film in its glory), I find that ""Rocky"" is very easily one of the best movies ever made. The story of strength, determination, and the desperate need of a new hero in the wake of political turmoil during the 1970s helped Rocky Balboa's eventual rise to fame at the box office in '76, and his subsequent entry into pop culture history. At the heart of the film, is the title character, a hard-luck Philadelphia loser played gloriously by Stallone. The muscle for a local loan shark, his only real source of pride is in the ring, besting other fighters who are way below his skill level. On the side, he also flirts with Adrian (Talia Shire), the sister of his best friend Paulie (Burt Young) who is also the chronically shy clerk of the pet store where he frequents. When the reigning world heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) discovers he needs a challenger for the upcoming Bicentennial because all the rest of the competition has bowed out, he chooses the ""Italian Stallion"" out of other contenders. When Rocky gets the news, he sees it as a chance to prove his worth and ""go the distance"" and start training with a former champ, Mickey (Burgess Meredith). ""Rocky"" was a huge hit in 1976, as Stallone's script floated around Hollywood for several years before being picked up by United Artists and given to director John G. Avildsen. Sure, ""Rocky"" gets off to a slow start. But that's part of its magic: to let the audience really know who these people are, and the lives they are leading. The big day does come, but there's something about the conclusion of the picture that will always remain true to real life, and about that once-in-a-lifetime, million-to-one shot at glory.<br/><br/>10/10"
"sammy105","8","1","2","2 February 2007"," Power and very down-to-earth, which beats anything sci-fi in many ways
","Well, I must say, I always liked Rocky myself, but only saw the original after the Balboa movie came out. What moved me most about it was not the fighting, not his ""ugliness"" that some people say makes it more realistic and easier to related to; my favorite aspect of Rocky was the transformation the girl Adrian makes throughout the movie, her character, her look, her whole self. This, I believe, was what Stallone truly wanted to point out, even if he didn't admit to the tabloids - I think he wanted to say to the world that it's not the beautiful, extroverted women who truly deserve attention at times, but women like Adrian who live quiet, but shaky, mistreated lives and don't allow themselves to be heard. Realizing this throughout the movie put tears in my eyes, I won't even hide it. The reason this movie deserves Best Picture I think is because it focuses on the more positive human traits - love, honor, respect, etc, unlike Taxi Driver. No matter what movie I see about crime in whatever shape, I'm never left with the heartwarming feel I got from Rocky. And I guess the media agrees with me: look at the movies that Hot Shots - the 'mother of all movies' - chose to allude to to show a true love memento - Rocky, Superman, and... Lolita, was it? Anyway, the part when she rushes over to him after the fight was a huge climax that summed everything up superbly. I even expected that it would be her doing that that would get him to win, because that would've increased the voltage of the scene many times over, I think."

"jacksenvy","10","1","2","27 December 2006"," Rocky: The Greatest
","I think Frank Capra said it all when after having seen the film, he said ""Now there is a film I wish I had made"" Rocky manages to be wholly realistic, and utterly uplifting. Performances from the leads right down to the minor supporting players are beautifully realised. It is very easy to see why Stallone was touted as the next Brando after this movie. His acting ability, delivery, and physicality are all reminiscent of the great man himself. Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, and of course Burgess Meredith are all wonderful. They take an already great screenplay and make it better by adding nuance, layers, and idiosyncrasies to their characters without trying to hog the picture. Whenever any of these actors appear on screen, it is like they are the star, and the movie could be about them. But let us not forget Stallone. He is the lynch pin around which the movie revolves. An acting style so natural you'd swear that it was a documentary. A movie that makes what should be unlikeable characters lovable, because you understand them. It is no wonder Stallone continued to revisit these characters a further five times. A truly great movie, that stands shoulder to shoulder with any other movie ever made."

Well, this is truly the greatest underdog film ever made, and it deserved every bit of praise it received. Rocky Balboa was a nobody, and to him it wasn't about the title. It was about having his name up in lights next to Apollo Creed. It was about doing something with his life other than roughing people up for money. This isn't an action packed boxing movie. It's very character driven. This doesn't even necessarily have to be called a boxing or sport movie. It's more of a drama that just happens to involve a man who boxes. The movie is well paced and well directed. Sylvester Stallone wrote a pretty good script with some good dialogue.<br/><br/>The movie is very well acted. Whenever people think of Sylvester Stallone they think of Rocky's voice, but most people should know that that's just the character, and Sylvester Stallone plays it well. Talia Shire does a good job playing shy and making the transition to outspoken. Burt Young is good as Rocky's best friend Paulie and Carl Weathers is good as heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>Rocky is a great classic that still holds up as a good movie today, and I look forward to seeing the latest entry in the series to see how Stallone ends the franchise.<br/><br/>8/10"

"jakemsn4","10","1","2","8 January 2006"," I don't understand how so many people love Rocky Part 1 but find the other four no good
","I love the first Rocky much more than the other four, but that doesn't mean the other four ""sucked"" as so many people put it. Many people love the first one and dis the other four, I don't understand. Please enlighten me. Since my comment is to question why people love the first one and dis the other four, I thought it would be more appropriate to post it in the Rocky part I users comments section rather than in the other four Rockys' user comments sections.<br/><br/>What is Rocky One about? Character, drama, perseverance, fighting for what you want, soul, romance, etc., plus wicked training scenes. Can anyone say that these elements were not delivered in the sequels? In Rocky 2, it is Adrian's near-miscarriage and going from disapproving of Rocky's rematch to literally commanding him from her hospital bed to win (Adrian: ""There is one thing I want you to do for me. Win. (pauses). Win."") that causes Rocky to start training like the devil. Am I the only one here moved by this? In Rocky 3, Rocky is so shaken up by his trainer (and mentor and father-figure)'s death that he can't train properly. Adrian has a one-to-one conversation with him on the beach where she SNAPS him back to reality, telling him winning is about self-love, not about reputation and guilt (Rocky feels guilty that he lied to Mickey about winning the first fight with Mr.T), that losing is OK as long as you don't lose with fear, among other inspiring comments. Adrian's message is so powerful it makes Rocky able to train like a madman again. This is pretty cool. But the coolest thing has to be how the movie shows that Rocky has gotten too cocky (and ""civilized"", as Mickey puts it) and barely breaks a sweat while training for the first fight, and must go back to the dirtiest filthiest and gruesome training conditions in order to win the rematch. Am I the only one who found this totally cool, and moving? Rocky 4, gives you TWO wicked training scenes. One, in which Rocky is running in the rivers, and a second one, after being visited by Adrian, in which Rocky runs up mountains. no one seems to mention how great it is that in both of these training scenes, a constant comparison is made between Rocky and the Russian in that Rocky uses the nature environment (e.g. wooden logs, snow, mountains, saws, etc.) to train whereas the Russian is using steroid injections instead of spirit, stair machines instead of mountains, indoor running track instead of snow and rivers, and many other examples. While Rocky runs to the top of cold mountains and yells at the top of his lungs and is monitored daily by the love of his wife and the friendship of the coach of the now-deceased Apollo, the Russian is climbing the freakin' stair-master while being monitored by assistants who only care to train the Russian for selfish and nationalistic reasons, not because they care about him. How awesome and symbolic are these comparisons, which show us that nature, not drugs, is what truly creates victories, and love and friendship, not bullying from others, are what truly creates good training. So many people say Rocky 4 was simply ""glossy"";,running up mountains and screaming in the freezing, nothing glossy about that. And as he is running up the steepest part of the mountain, the climax of the song is also being played, simultaneously showing that the Russian is still climbing his pathetic little incline treadmill and the lab technicians and monitoring him like he's an experimental rat. This stuff doesn't move anyone? And Rocky 5 was obviously a mock on Don King, but like all the other Rocky's is full of soul. Rocky goes back to his hometown and visits Mickey's gym now full dust, where he hangs out and visualizes an entire conversation he had with Mickey years ago. I almost cried watching this. The second teary moment for me came much later when Adrian says this: ""I know when somebody like Tommy comes along, you feel alive. But he's not you. He doesn't have your heart. All those fighters you beat, you beat 'em with heart, not muscle. Mickey knew that. That's why you and Mickey were special. But Mickey's dead. If there's something you wanna pass on, pass it on to your son, for God's sakes! Your son is lost!"" The greatest is when she says ""You beat them with heart, not muscle. Mickey knew that ... that's why you and Mickey were special"". HOW CAN ANYONE DISS ROCKY 5 WITH THIS IN IT? How many friends in our own lives these days can actually distinguish between muscle and heart? And how often do we get betrayed by friends, because they care about muscle, not heart? So there's my comment on each of the five. I wanna ask all you who love Rocky part one and then dis the other four, did you not feel any of the things I mentioned above for each sequel?"

I don't know how many of you realized that many parts of the movie were like a documentary of the life of an average American and if we cut the whole sport thing, the movie would have been a documentary that make us think and realize how lucky we are. Rocky's life sucked and boxing for him was something more than just hobby or something he likes to do. It's the thing that destroyed the bad thoughts in his mind. He might have seemed stupid and careless about what is going to happen to him, but I don't think so. Haven't you ever met a person who doesn't show he cares about something with facials, actions or words, but he just feels it inside him and he doesn't feel the need to release it. That was Rocky's character and that is why I love that movie. Well one of the many reasons. The supporting characters are wonderful as well and the original Rocky is something not to be forgotten ever while the sequels are just entertaining. Once again - a wonderful motion picture I will always love, with great atmosphere, score. Well some bad editing and direction, but who cares. A movie with no flaws wouldn't be a movie."

","Down-on-his-luck, aspiring actor Sylvester Stallone watched Chuck Wepner, a ""ham and egger,"" go the distance with Muhammad Ali, going as far against him as many greats of that era. That 1974 fight inspired ""Rocky,"" the story of a Philadelphia fringe boxer/wiseguy who isn't really good at either, scraping together a living collecting debts for Mr. Gasso (a loan shark), boxing for minimum wage, and the generosity of butcher friend Paulie, who wants in with Gasso.<br/><br/>I saw this film twenty-three times on HBO in February 1978, when I first got HBO, but didn't really appreciate it until I had lived in Philadelphia for several years after moving from New York. The movie captures the spirit of Philadelphia, from its shiftless characters who barely have a niche in life, to the spirit of its citizens, who are like poodles that think they can ""go the distance"" with a pitbull.<br/><br/>Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has a New Year's bout that is in danger of being cancelled when the challenger is injured during training. Faced with having to refund the tickets and eat the overhead for the fight, Creed decides to give a local, unknown fighter a shot at the title. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is chosen because of his nickname: ""The Italian Stallion."" Rocky is tough as nails, but lacks the boxing skills of Creed, and sets as his goal, to go the distance, to leave the ring proudly on his feet.<br/><br/>Mickey (Burgess Meredith, ex-Penguin from the ""Batman"" TV series) is a boxing gym owner and trainer who puts the ""old"" in ""old school."" After kicking Rocky out of his locker for being a thug, he begs his way back into training Rocky for the fight. With only five weeks to train, he doesn't even try to teach Rocky how to box, but more how to beat the living crap out of Apollo. He teaches only the rudiments of boxing and how not to fear the heavyweight champion of the world. Mickey trains Rocky to win, making the most of his own chance of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Creed does not take the fight seriously, training sporadically, figuring he'll put on a good show for the crowd before disposing of Rocky. His trainer is more concerned, especially when he catches film of Rocky's devastating left hand. Rocky, who gets $150,000 for the fight, trains mostly not to embarrass himself, but in doing so he does the one thing Creed does not, and that is preparing to deliver a peak effort. Rocky doesn't know what he has, but whatever he's got, none of it will be left on the table at the end of the fight.<br/><br/>The fight begins with Creed using Rocky as a punching bag, until a minor slip-up allows Rocky to deck him to the canvas with an uppercut, sending the local fans wild. After a few rounds, when Creed has hit Rocky with everything he has but Rocky is still standing, Rocky begins to lose respect for creed, his street instincts kick in, and for the rest of the fight he has no fear of his opponent. Creed can box, but Rocky can break bones, and even the heavyweight champion is not immune to that type of destruction. Once Creed went down (something no other fighter had ever done), Rocky had already won, and he did not try to safely go the distance, but to do so as an equal. The result is one of the best fights in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>The Best Picture Oscar was well deserved."

","This is the movie that pitted a second-rate prize fighter against the reigning heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky is not just a boxing movie but it is about the fact that in America anyone can get the opportunity of a lifetime. From the opening scene to the climatic finish, Rocky is a timeless masterpiece. Stallone did an exceptional job with the script and acted Rocky's character to near perfection. This movie has many classic scenes from Rocky's run up the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum to his moment alone in the Philadelphia Spectrum. Bill Conti did an amazing job in helping make Rocky a masterpiece. Conti's ""Gonna Fly Now"" was perfectly placed in the scene in which Rocky runs throughout South Philadelphia up the steps of the art museum. It was really in the ring where Conti actually did his real work though. ""Going the Distance"" and ""Final Bell"" emotionally triggered audiences at the perfect moments and made the Bi-centennial fight more than just a brawl but a fight for survival between the underdog and the champ. Burt Young (Paulie), Talia Shire (Adrian), Burgess Meredith (Mickey), David Thayer (Jergens) and Jimmy Gambina (Mike) all did tremendous jobs at depicting their respective characters. When you scrap all this together you get an Oscar winning movie that is so beautifully constructed that it could bring a tear to anyone's eye."

","7/10<br/><br/>From the slums of Philadelphia comes a courageous if misguided nobody, who has the heart and determination to reach his goals if only he could believe in himself. Indeed this movies plot line is somewhat over-used nowadays, but you cannot argue that Rocky was a catalyst for the 'it's not the size of the dog in the fight that counts, its the size of the fight in the dog'. Sylvester Stallone portrays the wannabe fighter, and the character development is extremely touching on times especially as he forges a partnership with Adrian (Talia Shire) who throughout is tremendous. Sure the boxing sequences are a something of make believe, but that only goes to enhance the entertainment. <br/><br/>As Rocky begins to reach the big time he faces the ultimate task of trying to beat the American dream that is Apollo Creed and take his chance in the big time. Burgess Meredith is outstanding as the long suffering boxing trainer and his angry characteristics only served to give a deeper emotional side to the love and warmth he feels for Rocky.

"Brian-272","10","1","2","6 July 2000"," Human Triumph. A Tribute To The Human Spirit And Heart. Loved By The Underdog. A Classic For Everyone.
","Many are unaware that Stallone got the idea of a screenplay for Rocky from a professional fight between little-known Chuck Wepner and Muhammad Ali. A fight in which little-known Wepner went the fifteen round distance with the greatest Ali. It took Stallone only three days to write the story of an underdog boxer named Rocky Balboa. Shot on a shoestring budget in just under a month, Stallone had the sleeper hit of 1976, winning Best Picture and Director Oscars while Stallone received acting and writing nominations. Rocky is a beloved classic for many reasons the film has a certain theme to it the film has more to it than fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world. Most importantly Rocky gives a message of fighting and standing up for what you believe in. No matter how much of an underdog you are fight for what you believe and prove the doubters wrong. Balboa proves this by finding love with shy Adrian(Talia Shire) proving no matter how awkward a person may seem love is possible for anyone and they can live the American Dream together. Rocky is more than a movie about a fourth-rate boxer who gets a shot at the title. Aside from finding love the film is a study of finding one's self through hard work and determination though Rocky Balboa(Stallone) taste defeat at the hands of Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) he felt that of a winner for going the distance proving it's not whether you win or lose or draw , but whether or not you fight hard. Remember(Balboa) his whole life was a million-to-one chance. Sure Rocky was what made Sly Stallone a movie superstar, and Rocky also came to be a film that helped start what we call sequels. The main message in Rocky is for anyone who's ever won or lost hope and happiness are always possible. Success is possible to any underdog who works hard. Rocky is a symbol of the American Dream. Finally Rocky is one of the best films of the century a must watch for anyone and you will want to review the sentimental theme of the film many times. A classic forever."
"FlickJunkie-2","10","1","2","3 June 2000"," One of my top 50 of all time
","Once in a long while, there comes a film that has such tremendous gestalt that it rises above any negative criticism.  Rocky' is such a film.  It is more than just a story about an underdog boxer who makes the best of a title shot.  It is a story about perseverance, heart and courage.  Most of all it is a story about transcendence.  All the major characters in the film, including Apollo Creed, transcended their previous limitations.  If you reflect on it, Mick, Paulie, Adrian and Rocky were all changed people by the end of the film.  Apollo was changed too, but we didn't realize it until the sequel.  <br/><br/>The film was also a transcendent event for Stallone, and served as an allegory of his life.  If there ever was an underdog in Hollywood, it was Sly Stallone.  His trademark droopy eyes and slurred speech were the result of a severed nerve at birth, and this disability was not conducive landing roles as a leading man.  As a child, he was teased for his slur, and coupled with his name endured a childhood of Tweety bird jokes.   He knew a little about fighting.  He was expelled from fourteen schools by the time he was fifteen.  In the film, when Rocky was knocked down and his corner told him to stay down, it was symbolic of his own life when his acting teachers at University of Miami tried to dissuade him from acting.  In both cases he got up and proved them wrong.<br/><br/>This film found its original inspiration in a boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner (a.k.a. The Bayonne Bleeder), an astronomical underdog who lasted fifteen punishing rounds and emerged with his pride and a face that looked like ground beef.  Anyone who saw that fight and this film would see the obvious similarities in Ali/Creed and Wepner/Balboa.  After seeing this fight, Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days.<br/><br/>Stallone had several big money producers interested in the script, but they refused to produce it with him in the lead.  So he turned them down and produced it on a shoestring, grossing over $225 million and winning Best Picture and Director Oscars and acting and writing nominations for Stallone. Stallone should have stopped after the first Rocky' as the sequels did not and could not compare.  However, I can't blame him for riding the gravy train after the price he paid for admission.<br/><br/>Stallone is brilliant in the role, as the inspiration came from his own life.  He simultaneously elicits pathos and respect from the viewer.  Though Balboa is none too bright, Stallone gives him a pure heart, unswerving desire and through sheer simplicity makes him the wisest of all the characters in the film.  By the end, everyone in the theater is pulling for Rocky because to do so is to cheer for their own lost dreams.  I still get a lump in my throat when he screams out, `Adrian' at the end. <br/><br/>
This film is in my top 50 of all time.  I'm partial to underdog stories and this is the heavyweight champion of that category.  I rated it a perfect 10. Rocky' may not have been great filmmaking but it was great art.  Would that life could always imitate art as well as it did in this film."

","After more than twenty years after its release, no other film reached the success and touched so many hearts as Rocky. A genuine B movie that costed one million dollars turned out to be one of the most beautiful and inspiring things ever placed on the screens, Rocky is the result of the effort and determination of Sylvester Stallone, who wrote the story and played the humble and simple-minded boxer who is willing to risk his own life to go the distance for self-respect. Burt Reynolds was in talks to play Rocky, and in spite of me consider myself Burt Reynolds's biggest fan in the whole world, Sylvester Stallone was  the only actor who could give life to that character, because Rocky is in a certain way Stallone's own history. At the time, Stallone  worked in films of third category and  suddenly,after the risk he took to star in Rocky, he became one of the greatest Hollywood's stars.This touching, old-fashioned film tells the story of Rocky Balboa, a guy who really never had any chance in his life.Rocky is a small-time boxer, he fights in clubs and also lives in a poor neighborhood. Everyone humiliates Rocky, including Mickey (Burgess Meredith, in a terrific performance), his trainer : ""you've got heart but you fight like a goddamn ape!"", Mickey yells at Rocky. Then something happens. Rocky has his life turned upside down when, for some reason of the destiny, the indestructible heavy weight champion of the world Apollo Creed chooses the ""Italian Stallion"" for an exhibition fight, that actually should be just a show for Apollo. But for Rocky, the fight is not just a show, but the last chance that he has to show to the world that any loser has the chance to conquer redemption. In the day of the fight, the arrogant Apollo is surprised by the small-time boxer who not only goes the whole distance with the champion ,but also teaches a lesson Apollo will never forget. Rocky is one of the greatest films of the century - excellent performances, a superb direction by John G. Avildsen, an involving and touching story and beautiful moments that will stay in your hearts forever - who can forget Rocky's running up the steps of the museum of Philadelphia and Bill Conti's unforgettable song, or even the scene in which Mickey (Burgess Meredith), the old trainer who never gave a chance to Rocky, lowly asks for forgiveness. When you feel sad or without hopes, watch this film. Something will change inside of you."

It is a story well told.  A story that gives people who are down and out hope.  It is a story that never grows old, and it will never die, because hope is something that is almost impossible to kill.  A story of hope is a wonderful gift to give.  And he gave it to us to enjoy over and over again.  Hope doesn't get old or tired, and there are none who don't need it.  This film is an inspiration to all to just try a little harder, do it one more time, and who knows, you may succeed next time around.

","In the 1976 Oscars, Rocky went up against such films as Taxi Driver, Network, All the Presidents Men and Bound For Glory.  Rocky won because it was not in the least bit cynical.  Sylvester Stallone gives the best performance of his career.  It's not weighed down with overwrought cliches, or explosions.  He's a nice guy from Philly who has a big heart.  All he's ever wanted to do is fight, and go the distance.  Apollo Creed gives Rocky the chance, and you're not given many chances like this.  In Rocky's eyes, we see the fear and excitement mixing.  He knows he won't win, he just wants to prove to the world, and to himself, that he's not a bum."

","How this movie won 3 Oscars (best movie, best director and best editing) is beyond my comprehension. It has only two combats, at the beginning and the end, and badly done. The rest of the 2 hours is to see Stallone stroll around the neighborhood, putting up with his boring and unbearable best friend Paulie and trying to woo Paulie's vapid sister, Adrian, between takes that are too long of his training sessions. Meanwhile, we do not see his opponent Apollo training once, but I still have my doubts if that alone would be enough to give Rocky a remote chance to stand up to the final gong, since he only had just a month to prepare against an adversary totally above his league.<br/><br/>I think this movie appeals to so many people for being a ""David vs Goliath"" tale and for conveying the false hopeful message that a nobody can, through much effort, win the lottery, which is what happened to Rocky when ""chosen"" for the heavyweight final. The movie is very slow and boring. The dialogue is the most basic I have ever seen, but it gives me the impression that this was on purpose to further depress the caricatures of neighborhood' people (probably the masses review themselves in this - and I'm not trying to be condescending here since I myself come from a low income social class!!!). The only positive point is Stallone's portrayal - probably the highest point of his career here - conveying some life and credibility to his character, who seems a bit inspired by Marlon Brando's interpretation in ""On the Waterfront"", but while Brando had the pigeons, Rocky has little turtles."

","Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa is a small time boxer who has taken to collecting debts for a local mobster.  However when he is picked as an easy fight for champ Apollo Creed he sees his chance to make it.  With help and hindrance from his fellow blue-collar workers he seeks to climb out of his situation.<br/><br/>The film that launched Stallone as a mainstream star and proves that he has more brains than many of his roles may let you think.  Stallone wrote this passable story of working class boy makes good in a few days after watching Ali v's Wepner in a brave fight.  He sold the rights to the story on the condition that he would star.  He was also brave enough to turn down $150,000 to give up the role.  The story is nothing hugely special  a working class boxer makes it big through sweat, grit and pure determination, but it's done with a great amount of emotion and walks the line between plausibility and smaltz well.<br/><br/>The film's buildup just manages to avoid being totally clichéd and some of the dialogue is a little corny  however what lifts the film is the final fight.  The fight is one of the most unrealistic in cinema  this is no Raging Bull!  However it is a pure exploitative bit of cinema.  The effort of Stallone, the sweeping music, the tension etc all hits the right buttons and involves us well.  It may not be wonderful but it's certainly a prime example of a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>Stallone is good and was Oscar nominated, but Burgess Meredith is excellent as an old boxer turned trainer.  Talia Shire is pretty good as Adrian but her character comes out of herself a little too easily.  Carl Weathers is good as Creed, but doesn't have too much to do.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't a classic but it works well as a sort of `rags to riches' tale and as a good old Hollywood button pusher.

"Semisonic","6","1","3","1 April 2016"," A triumph of self-pitying losers
","I'm well aware of the story behind the creation of Rocky, especially the fact that Stallone had a very hard time to draw the studios' attention to the screenplay which was his vision of a chance to get out of the obscurity his career and himself were in at that time. So if we were to look at Rocky as a defining moment for the Stallone's star then yeah, it's a pretty important film. However, i don't think that a film's merits should be defined by whose career it helped boost. And, as a separate cinematographic product, Rocky is not just undeserving to be among the best films of all times, it's plain average.<br/><br/>The whole fiber of the film oozes hopelessness and despair. And maybe Philadelphia of the 70's was indeed a grim place to live in. But the main reason for setting up a story in such a depressing environment is to allude the life of Rocky Balboa and those surrounding him to some kind of a Cinderella story and make us root for the underdog. And it might have even worked if Rocky was even slightly intriguing and charismatic.<br/><br/>Instead, Stallone's script does its best to avert the audience from Rocky. The first half of the film is basically a showcase of what a bum (if not a true imbecile) Rocky is. Unable to talk like a human being, instead mumbling some deranged nonsense, Rocky is more like Frankenstein than Cinderella, roaming around the murky streets of the Philadelphia slums, devoid of any idea how to live his life today or what to do with it tomorrow. The only way to make him look less of a creep was to give him pet turtles and an affection for an equally socially and emotionally disabled woman working in a store nearby, which might be sentimental enough to work for some, but feels unbelievably forced and corny to me.<br/><br/>But for the Cinderella story to work, Rocky had to receive an invitation to a ball. A title boxing fight in his case. Which happens late enough to get bored by Balboa's constant downer's attitude (how's that for an example: ""You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter, you know what I mean? It's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum.""). But, luckily, still early enough to give the film some room to capitalize on that change. Because when Rocky finally shuts it and starts doing something useful, he becomes watchable at last. Even inspiring for some.<br/><br/>The end of this fairy tale is as predictable as it's gracious for the protagonist. It's by no means realistic, but i guess Stallone just didn't have enough star fever to write a better ending for his character. Still, the fact that the film ends rather abruptly is probably a sign that the author had no idea what to do next other than to call a woman to the rescue. Unfortunately, the impression that the whole film leaves is exactly the same: unaware of its goals, hardly knowing what to do, simply trying to go the distance because... well, because there's no much choice otherwise. Apparently, the audience loved that blind weary spirit back in the day, but now it looks like the success of Rocky and the career of Stallone itself were nothing but freak luck."

","Described as one of the best uplifting dramas ever made, and probably the most popular underdog story of all time, I had to see it, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director John G. Avildsen (The Karate Kid). Basically Rocky Balboa (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sylvester Stallone) is a struggling small-time boxer in Philadelphia, who works in a meat factory, and also collects debts for loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell). Rocky boxes once in a while to develop his skills, his ex-trainer Mickey (Batman's Oscar nominated Burgess Meredith) thinks he could be on top if he really worked hard, which is why he is really hard on him. Current world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Predator's Carl Weathers) is visiting Philadelphia, and after a match he was keen on falls through, he and his promoters decide to set up a once in a lifetime opportunity for an unknown boxer to fight him, they of course pick Rocky, ""The Italian Stallion"". Rocky, while training for this event, is trying to get closer to his local pet shop owner Adrian (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Talia Shire), who is very shy, but they do fall for each other. So it comes to the big match, and after Rocky in his training montage, with that iconic theme, he is ready to face Apollo, and it takes more than three rounds to finish either of them off. The final round is really hard to watch, and even though Rocky didn't win, you really feel up in arms for him, and he and Adrian declare their love for each other. Also starring Oscar nominated Burt Young as Paulie, Thayer David as Jergens and Joe Frazier. Stallone is brilliantly convincing as the no-hoper boxer who makes the most of his opportunity, Weathers does well as a worthy opponent, Shire wonderful being quiet and attractive, and Meredith, still almost quacking like his Penguin, is gloriously over-the-top grouchy. This is a story that will appeal to all those people out there who want to achieve something, and this shows with hard work, it can be done, and it doesn't necessarily matter how long it lasts, with the iconic montage sequence and catchy music, and the great fight sequences, especially of course the finale, this is a must see boxing drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Song for ""Gonna Fly Now"" (which was number 58 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Stallone, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Screenplay and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score for Bill Conti and Best Screenplay.

","It's been a long time since I last watched it. I could've sworn it was a movie about boxing. About an underdog who gets a chance and makes the most of it.<br/><br/>But as I watch it now, I've come to realize it's in fact a movie about the dangers of brain damage. Every single person in this movie is brain damaged, from the boxers and trainers down to the ice rink janitor, meat hauling half-wit...<br/><br/>There are a couple of different ways how this shows. The most obvious and most irritating one is the way people communicate. Talking to people is done almost entirely via screaming. Everything turns into a screaming match. It is not only tiresome, but also just plain obnoxious.<br/><br/>Many parts of the movie are good, though. The premise is interesting, the setting dramatic just by itself. The boxing parts seem authentic enough, but there's not enough of it here to satisfy those of us who are only here for it.<br/><br/>All other things aside, first hour of the movie is skippable, and the rest pretty forgettable. If you took the screaming out, maybe it'd at least be tolerable, but as it is right now, it's not as good as you might remember. An iconic movie to be sure, but not a particularly good one."

Avildsen might as well be directing ""Rocky Watches Grass Grow,"" as nothing truly great happens until at least the last third of the movie. Burt Young and Talia Shire seem to live for their shouting matches, which are not that impressive when compared, say, to ""Reds"" or ""The Godfather"". Carl Weathers helps boost things, but it isn't until ""Rocky II"" that his character gets a fair shake.<br/><br/>It's a shame that for a movie this acclaimed, more couldn't have happened. But for many people, it is still the ultimate inspirational picture, that delivers a clever message with at least a couple ounces of ingenuity.<br/><br/>In other words, ""Rocky"" is a movie backed by a dream, but the dream is never quite fulfilled."

","This was the ultimate Rocky story wasn't it?<br/><br/>It was inspiring with the training, it was inspiring with the fight, and it was about the characters and the characters are what makes a great story.<br/><br/>The down side was Creed, he was a little under-developed in this wasn't he? They make up for it in Rocky II, III, and IV, but in Rocky he felt like a faceless nemesis didn't he? He was Mohamed Ali without real depth in this and the story could have used to develop him a little more in the first one.<br/><br/>But... we got it in the sequels.<br/><br/>The biggest selling point was the love story... I know mushy, right? ... but they did a great job of making it awkward and at times intimidating as well as absolutely sweet and charming and it was completely realistic and believable.<br/><br/>You could sit down and watch it and understand how they fell for one another. You got a sense of who they were and that carried over into Rocky II... but kind of ended in III and we only caught a glimpse of it here and there until Balboa.<br/><br/>Still, it was the low budget movie that stole out hearts. And it was the inspiring story about the underdog, and Rocky movies are best when they inspire."
"sashank_kini-1","5","1","5","21 April 2011"," Schlocky
","The most memorable moment in Rocky is the love-scene between and Adrian, both steaming the otherwise fetid room with such clean passion that it surpasses all cardinal passions. Adrian first tries to resists; an act shy but with slow excitement, then acquiesces and lastly is enticed. Rocky slowly allures kisses and then makes love. Both connect emotionally, nullifying each other's weaknesses. The problem is that 'this' is the best scene in the movie, while the 'action' and the 'sport' which should succeed, sag. This kind of movies should be a little unpolished but not indecisive. Rocky made me feel like watching just a sweet romance rather than an action, an underdog story. It more seems like Boxing Practice 101. Rule 1: Gulp down six raw eggs Rule 2: Jog a mile or ten! <br/><br/>I've simply adored Million Dollar Baby for its guts, but mainly its balance of action and drama. The second half is so emotionally straining, I couldn't bear it in the end and cried my eyes out. Rocky could've been such a film had it not stooped to maudlin and pretense. The movie feels and looks more like the 30s, with I don't know, the accent maybe. Or the caricature that the supporting cast is. The opening scene is a normal boxing match with the brawny Stallone facing another unknown face. A small-time boxer and a collector for a 'large-hearted' loan-shark named Gazzo; he lives an ordinary life, loving his pets, trying to woo a painfully shy girl and teaching an androgynous girl lessons to act more womanly. His preference can be known from the conversation as he explains to her how a foul-mouthed girl would be termed nothing but a ""w**re"" in future, and would rather want a lady to be his wife, which he notices in Adrian. This small-timer is suddenly placed on a pedestal when he is given an opportunity to face the flamboyant, insidious, conceited world-champion Apollo Creed, who does this all for a ""good show"".<br/><br/>Sylvester does have inkling about what he has to do, but I didn't see any vigor in his eyes. In short, his eyes were dead. In the scene where he vents out his frustration on his to-be trainer for not having faith in him before, he says the line but means them not much. Also, it is difficult to overlook the garbled voice that he speaks in. However, the script is a shade better, replete with humor and love. But it is heavy-handed, especially during the end. Sly is better a screenwriter here. The choreography of the boxing sequences is anything but memorable though, as it never gains steam. The climatic boxing scene seems rushed and irresolute. Sly could've sought professional help in these sequences than writing it himself.<br/><br/>Talia is spot-on as the highly introverted, taciturn girl-friend who breaks down hysterically in one of the scenes. I could emphasize with her since I myself am a very introverted but caring person who have bouts of hysterics. The most captivating quality is that Talia doesn't speak much but remained composed in a way that radiates untold emotions. Her character is unfairly treated in the end where she seems more like the heroine from Grease who runs to her love in the end.<br/><br/>Others in the movie frankly don't matter much. Burt Young as the crass, resentful but attention-seeking, insecure brother of Adrian, to be honest, was plain forgettable. Burgess as the surly coach with a story of failure in the past is generic to the extreme. His ""come on, Rocky"" chants really don't work because such character is more suited for a college movie with unruly youngsters (i.e. Grease). Carl Weathers' character Apollo reminds me of Lady Gaga, and he is more of a friendly villain here, which is a contrast from other sports movies, but I prefer the old-fashioned ones, a figure to hate.<br/><br/>The story at times gets to verbose or drab, as one always expects a broken tooth or dislocated shoulder in the middle. Two fights won't do for a classic sports film. The direction is schmaltzy at multiple places, though noble at a few. The background score, even though had some potential hits, didn't have an enlivening effect to make you go ""YaY!"" in the end. Considering the tight budget, these slights errs can be forgiven. But even films with shoe-string budget can deliver better. And next time, please let Talia do the talking and Sly more action. May watch and review the sequel when I am free, though I am not too keen on it. 5/10"

","I half enjoyed dragging myself through this but quite honestly I do feel its sub par acting on a b-movie script. Burgess Meredith could do this in his sleep and all he can attempt with this stuff is chew the scenery (after all he has to get us past the idea he was meant to be a great boxer in the Twenties!). The love interest is appallingly laughable - could they attempt to make her more unappealing in that damn coat and evoke our sympathy more? The film Marty covered much of this ground twenty years earlier. The positive side is not actually part of the film - the fact that Stallone wrote this and managed to get it made, low budget to huge success is a commendable achievement. That very success, initially, is explicable only in a 1976 post Watergate, energy crisis, worries about urban decay, Vietnam, everything is awful, America needs to feel good again way. Its continued high marks by viewers I can only find inexplicable. There are some well put together scenes (technically speaking) especially considering the low-budget (I am assuming it was low)and the overall message is indeed a pleasant one but truly this is a b-movie elevated above its rank. The alcoholic meat factory brother who throws the thanksgiving turkey out of the door is a caricature 'life is grim' sort of human. The 'I'll fight this nobody because everyone else is busy and I like the name 'Italian Stallion'as a competitor' plot line is risible. And so on. There are good things dotted about here, but in the way you admire bits of a good school play, give a round of applause and wish them well. Yo."

","It doesn't take an expert (not including myself) to recognize ROCKY as a genuine B-movie, something that hasn't been mentioned yet in the minds of IMDb users. Even for a 1976 Best Picture Oscar, the film really isn't all THAT great, until you're caught by the outstanding wonders of Sylvester Stallone's personally talented writing and his impressive street bum character of ""The Italian Stallion"". There are no stellar production values as expected from an upper-class Hollywood, but it's an easy-going movie that you can sit all the way through. Other than the landmark finale that remains among the most memorable shots on film, not a whole lot can be said. This is, pure and simple, great entertainment thanks to a bright mind who overcame tough obstacles in hitting a big time movie career.<br/><br/>***The mention of ""B-movie"" in this message can be exploited. Noteworthy in the film is Troma's founder and creator of THE TOXIC AVENGER Lloyd Kaufman, who took part in casting as a ""drunk"", and also serving as a pre-production supervisor. He also appeared (and presented) in John Avildsen's earliest directorial effort, CRY UNCLE. Long before ROCKY, Avildsen was known for making a couple of low budget films. It is assumed that he and Kaufman are true buddies in the movie-making business.<br/><br/>Don't be shocked and stunned at the original ROCKY being the greatest B-movie to take home the greatest honors in the world, particularly the Oscars!"

","I have tried so hard to love this movie over the years, hoping to connect to it in the same way that so many others seem to. Sadly, it always leaves me unmoved and a little bored.<br/><br/>My main problem with Rocky is that for a near 2-hour film about boxing, there is barely 15 minutes worth of actual fighting. The story crawls slowly and agonisingly towards the main event and then most of it is cut out and what we do see is unrealistic and completely devoid of strategy. The actual boxing choreography is a joke; there's no footwork, defence, feinting, blocking, jabbing, head or body movements. I am no boxing expert but based on the beatings he took, I'm pretty sure Rocky would have literally died had this fight been real.<br/><br/>The majority of the movie seems to involve Balboa engaging in rambled conversations, few of which help move the plot forward. Stallone is not strong enough as an actor and Balboa not interesting enough as a character to warrant this. Paulie is quite cliched and forgettable in this movie (although he does develop slowly through the series) and Mickey is a bit forced and melodramatic. Adrian is the only character with any real character development and Talia Shire's performance is comfortably the highlight of this movie.<br/><br/>I understand why people love this film so much but for me it is definitely a case of style over substance."

","For a low-budget, 'take a chance' type film, 'Rocky (1976)' is pretty accomplished and realistic stuff, with its focus always on building character and setting up an empathetic underdog rather than on overt spectacle (something some of the sequels would go on to struggle with). Some of it has aged quite a bit, though, to the point that the final bout isn't necessarily one of the piece's highlights, with many a miss passing for a hit. This isn't necessarily a big issue considering that the flick isn't really about that anyway, though the fact that some of the preceding film is a bit of a drag and that some of Stallone's dialogue is hard to decipher is more of a problem. It's not bad, by any stretch, but it isn't massively gripping and feels slightly more passive than it perhaps ought to. 5/10"

The sport scene, or the climax only comes at the last ten minutes, which is absolutely classic and memorable. <br/><br/>Besides, the message about American dream passed on by the film, namely everybody can achieve something extraordinary, is even more impressive.

","ROCKY was one of those big-hit films that I'd never got around to watching – much like SUPERMAN – but at last I've corrected that film-fan error. Yes, I've finally watched the movie that made Sylvester Stallone a star, the low budget surprise hit that turned out to be the best-remembered boxing film of all time. I suppose there are a lot of reasons I never got around to catching it before – always something more interesting, plus the fact that sports films aren't really my sort of thing. I should have checked this out sooner.<br/><br/>It's not a boxing film at all. Instead, it's a human drama, an uplifting story about a guy who goes from having nothing to having everything. Rocky Balboa is a wonderful creation, played to the hilt by a surprisingly human Stallone. For those used to seeing Stallone as nothing more than a well-muscled action man, think again: he brings plenty to the table as Rocky, giving his most human performance as a man filled with failings but whose spirit wins out come the end.<br/><br/>The low budget is sometimes glaringly obvious, and I can't help but feel that some long winded scenes and sub plots could have been cut out. I appreciate Rocky's romance with Talia Shire, as it gives the movie its core emotional thread, but I can't help but feel there are too many scenes with a drunken, unlikable Paulie than are strictly necessary. On the other hand, Rocky's scenes with Burgess Meredith are very well handled and moving, so kudos to them.<br/><br/>The training sequences are very well handled and it's no surprise that they influenced just about every sports movie that came afterwards – along with all the martial arts movies that copied DRUNKEN MASTER by focusing on long and strenuous training scenes. There isn't even any boxing until the end, as the whole film builds up to the terrific climax that doesn't disappoint. Carl Weathers is very tough and believable as Apollo Creed, too. So yeah – a fine film and another to tick off the list, even if it isn't something I'd go out of my way to watch again. I intend on catching up with the sequels, though."

","Rocky (1976): Dir: John G. Avildsen / Cast: Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith: The ultimate underdog film stars Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, a humble boxer in training who will receive his big break when a chance challenge is sent his way. Talia Shire plays Adrian Pennino, his love interest and sister to his best friend. She is shy and works at a pet store while at home she slaves for her unappreciative brother. Burt Young plays Paulie, her brother who works at a meat factory where he has Rocky trading punches with hanging slabs of meat. Carl Weathers plays boxing champion Apollo Creed who issues the challenge when his latest opponent backs out due to an injury. Burgess Meredith plays Mickey, who trains boxers at the gym and takes on Rocky when the challenge is issued. The result is a film with a lot of heart and a protagonist who works hard and has a good heart. Directed by John G. Avildsen who previously won acclaim with Save the Tiger. The climatic boxing match is energizing and brutal but given the appropriate conclusion. This is not about winning the bout but about winning respect for oneself as when Rocky calls out to Adrian because within all the cheers she is the most important thing. This is a film for the hard working underdog who desires to be a winner and has the determination and drive to get there. Score: 10 / 10"

","What most people don't realize is that Rocky isn't so much of a boxing movie as it is a love story. Well, that's what I got from it, anyway. The boxing is a big part of it, but we don't even get to the real meat of that story until about an hour in. And without even realizing it, we're getting a whole lot of character depth during the first half of the film. <br/><br/>Forget the creepy way that Rocky forces Adrian to give him that first kiss. The story as a whole is sweet. She's a true diamond in the rough. It's almost not even believable at first, but the two have so much chemistry that it works. <br/><br/>But like most of the movie, their relationship is without much conflict. Rocky doesn't overcome any crazy obstacles. He's a lazy boxer who hasn't made anything of his life, and when some freak opportunity presents itself, he finally works hard and gets what he wants. There isn't anything really standing in his way. Perhaps if they threw some conflict in there it may come off as contrived, but how it is now, it seems too easy. Maybe that's the point. I don't know.<br/><br/>Undefeated heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) needs a new opponent for the title fight after his current one drops out. But he wants this new competitor to be a no name amateur, so that the public will get into the underdog story. <br/><br/>And it's a good underdog story at that. You root for Rocky undeniably. But there could just be a little more in terms of a struggle. The biggest risk he takes is handed to him. And what does he have to lose, anyway?<br/><br/>Much of the film is dated with the fake punches and the already antiquated dialogue. There are points where the patter is so rhythmic that it sounds like it's from the '40s or '50s. It's a slow moving film, and some scenes just drag on for way too long. It helps add to the character development, but it does a number on our attention span. <br/><br/>Then there's predictability. The end result is telegraphed from a mile away. We can guess what's going to happen for most of the film. And we are usually proved right--another side effect of there not being any unexpected drama. <br/><br/>Nowadays, we have a quixotical view of Rocky, the all-American hero. Even the Academy was lost in its gaze with this film winning Best Picture back in 1977. But sadly, it's not as good as we want it to be. But that's not to say it's not good. It's still a cool underdog story, albeit not paying off as well as its predictability wants it to. However, corniness aside, this film set the pace for countless stories that came after it. And most of all, it has a lot of heart. You can't knock it for that. <br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 74"

","Even in the hands of more capable directors like Walter Hill (UNDISPUTED), Martin Scorsese (RAGING BULL) and Michael Mann (ALI), boxing has proved almost impossible to do well on The Big Screen. The way over the top slugfests in ROCKY lend the character an almost comic-book aspect (which suited the character well in later movies, when he faced everybody from Rocky, Junior- played by Tommy Morrison- to Godzilla- played by ""Hulk"" Hogan). Stallone would base yet another of his ROCKY movies (III) on the shenanigans of Ali (against giant Japanese professional wrestler Antonio Inoki) and Wepner (versus Andre the Giant). Stallone's debt to both Ali and Wepner is something that the star only begrudgingly admits (though it's crystal clear to anyone with at least one working eye).

"blacklist-1","9","0","1","6 September 2010"," An old classic that still packs a heck of a punch thirty-four year later.
","I must confess I have never ever watched the Rocky films before, none of them, though I knew that Slyvester Stallone played a boxer called Rocky. My brother is a big fan of the Rocky movies and has one to six as part of his DVD collection and I decided I would like to try watching them.<br/><br/>Rocky for me is an excellent movie as most people looking at the reviews on this website would agree. It is much more than just about boxing as we follow Stallone's character of Rocky Balboa who does small time boxing and has a second job of collecting money for a loan shark from his clients. He lives in a rundown area in Philidelphia where he regularly goes into his local pet store where he has a thing for shop assistant Adrian Pennino (Talia Shire) who is very shy and withdrawn and is treated badly by her brother Paulie Pennino (Burt Young). Meanwhile heavy title weight champion of the world Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) wants to give a low time boxer at chance at the title and he chooses Rocky who accepts.<br/><br/>What is most interesting is watching Rocky at how he lives his life and interacts with certain characters. Stallone gives a superb performance and though he may sound gruff when he speaks his lines, he does with a certain charm. Talia Shire as his love interest gives a great performance capturing the essence of her character Adrian trapped by her brother (A good supporting role by Burt Young) and very shy with little social interaction with others, but develops confidence by being around Rocky. Also Burgess Meredith as Mickey who offers to be Rocky's coach with his fight against Apollo is terrific in his supporting role as a man who is at the end of his days of boxing but still knows how the world works. Rocky and Adrian's romance, which is a substantial part of this film is beautifully depicted from two people one who is shy and awkward to one Rocky who tries to help her that evolves into two people comfortable with each other. The scene in Rocky's apartment where he and Adrian first kiss even though it's only for under a minute was electric. They make a nice couple with some good romantic chemistry there. Also there is depth to this movie with Rocky's character as we find out a bit about his life, his boxing past and even what he was like as a child.<br/><br/>One other surprising aspect is the script. It seems very basic with just ""street-talk"", but it is suited to the area he lives in (not that I'm saying all people in a less affluent area all speak street-talk). It was just suited to the film and as a result it works and makes it clever. The fighting itself with the showdown between Rocky and Creed is monumental with a excellently choreographed and tense fight as you root for Rocky. In that way it was inspiring. Rocky is not just about a boxer but how he lives his life with the area and who he interacts with. This gives more depth to his character and makes you care about him more. I never got bored with the length of two hours and now look forward to watching Rocky II and hope it will be great as well. An old classic this is but I loved it!"

","Watching Rocky I was reminded of what a former marine friend said to me once. During basic training exercises a drill instructor would tell him to do as many reps as he absolutely, possibly could do – and then do one more. It was a simple way to get across that achievement is mostly determined by mental resolve rather than physical condition.<br/><br/>A more well-known phrase best sums it up: a winner never quits, and a quitter never wins.<br/><br/>Rocky is about the personnel struggle inside to find that potential. Like any great movie, the character and setting are very specific, but anyone can relate to the message. With a down-and-out, aimless attitude, Rocky is an everyman searching for something better. He gets it by being selected for a title fight, but it is up to him to make the best of it. In this way the movie is part American dream, part Horatio Alger.<br/><br/>What works in the movie is the world of Rocky and Stallone's portrayal. He basically becomes Rocky, and fits right into the gritty back neighborhoods of Philadelphia. The other characters of this environment seem to be just surviving themselves. It's no wonder in the beginning Rocky feels resolved to a deterministic fate; he is surrounded by underachievers locked in their own world of perpetually blaming others for their lack of success.<br/><br/>But Rocky stands out, as something greater stirs within him. It takes a lucky break, an opportunistic veteran trainer, and a new love to give him something to believe in, and to jump start his ""eye of the tiger"" - but that's another movie."

","A million-to-one shot for both the character Rocky Balboa and the writer-actor who created him, Sylvester Stallone (who fought against the usual Hollywood belief system that a ""star"" should play the lead). This is the original Cinderella Man, a boxing story wherein the final outcome doesn't matter so much because the training montage already has the protagonist (and the audience) bursting with exhilaration. Low-life, good-hearted Phillie boxer Rocky is invited to go the distance with the heavyweight champion, a show-off in the Muhammad Ali mold. The human dynamics--with Rocky's aged trainer, his mousy sweetheart and her loud-mouthed brother--nearly turn the early scenes of the picture into a replay of a ""Playhouse 90"" sketch, and the boxing choreography and cinematography are both disappointing. However, when Stallone takes to the streets in his workout sweats, and Bill Conti's music floods the screen (the equivalent of a cheering section), all is forgiven. Stallone's writing is basic, however he does allow his characters to take shape--and he stays out of their way in the process. This is something he failed to do in the ""Rocky"" sequels, and why this one is obviously the best of the series. ***1/2 from ****"

","Rocky is one of the best films ever made and arguably the greatest sports movie ever made. It speaks to the best inside all of us, the human spirit and what it is capable of. True character shows when we are down, how we handle it. <br/><br/>Rocky, by being given an improbable shot did his best, not to win, but to go farther than he could have ever gone before. By standing up at the final bell he went farther than any of Apollo Creed's opponents had, and farther than anyone ever thought Rocky could go. Because he decided to take an active role in his future, everything else improved as a result. His self-worth, how people saw him, his love life, his friendships. All the supporting characters improved in some (or many) ways due to this event, even Apollo himself.<br/><br/>Rocky isn't just a fighter from south Philly, he is everyman. He's the kid studying for that SAT test to get him into college, those parents making daily sacrifices for their kids, the weekend athlete training in his spare time for that trophy to put on the mantle of the bar that sponsors his team, the executive closing that big deal, the baby taking his/her first steps, or the teacher searching for a new way to reach those troubled students. <br/><br/>Stallone changed his destiny with this film classic and sends us the message that going for it, even if we fall just a bit short, is noble. To end up on your feet, swinging until the final bell is something anyone can do. With a little inspiration, followed by perspiration,and determination life won't get to KO the Rocky in all of us."

","Sometimes, memories and the spirit of a movie are better than the movie itself. This is the case with this Rocky. <br/><br/>I was a teenager in the 80's, in which Stallone's movies are archetypal: Rambos, Rockys. <br/><br/>In regard to the boxer saga, I was fascinated with its symbolization of America (the star spangled shorts, Us vs CCCP) and the prime value of America, which Apollo Creed, its rival in this movie, announces clearly: ""America is the land where every one can go to the top if he takes the chance at hand"". In the hard times of maturing into an adult, these speech is a big help: ""believe in you, fight and you win"".<br/><br/>Maybe Rocky isn't the only movie with this message, but Stallone gives a very moving interpretation: he doesn't abuse others with his strength, he sticks with his values, he always gives an hand, and the romance with ""Adriannn"" is admirable by its simplicity & sincerity. A great applause for Talia Shire for playing with such talent, a blooming introvert's wise woman.<br/><br/>Rocky also makes a difference with the score, which is unforgettable, and later with the great songs (""eye of the tiger"").<br/><br/>So, you remember very easily all that & you care about, but, I don't find the pleasure to see this first part again and again. <br/><br/>On the other hand, this is also the 1st movie I saw on TV from a very long time, and I wanted to catch this airing after having seen at screen ""Rocky VI"", which I prefer (maybe because Rocky has aged as well as me.)<br/><br/>I leave you with two speeches in connection to Rocky:<br/><br/>1/ the Oscar winning speech of Forest Whitaker, which is a real but similar story to Rocky (why not make a movie about his life so?? (ah-ah): <br/><br/>""It wasn't my reality to think I would be acting in movies - so receiving this honour tonight tells me it is possible. It is possible for a kid from east Texas, raised in south central LA and Carson, who believes in his dreams, commits himself to them with his heart, to touch them and to have them happen."" <br/><br/>2/ the dialog with the crook Gazzo, because it is the exact painful dilemma I face everyday at work (even thought my job isn't to collect money for mob (ah-ah bis)), so it was fun to hear it in a movie: <br/><br/>""Did I give you a job this mornin?

","Rocky is one of those films that I can watch every time it is shown on TV and recently watched in full again due to buying the Anniversay Special Edition. It has the sort of story that would work in any situation, but particularly in sports. Everyone loves an underdog.<br/><br/>The film, as everyone must know, revolves around a 30 year old two-bit boxer who earns cash as muscle for a loan shark. He is seen smoking and boozing and obviously has let himself get out of peak shape. Rocky has also just lost his locker at the gym to a younger boxer and he is also having trouble asking out ultra shy pet store assistant Adrianne. The main crux of the film is after reigning champion Apollo Creed offers him a crack at the title as part of a 4th of July promotion when his leading contender pulls out, Rocky has to get in shape, shake off his doubts and prove to himself he isn't the loser he always thought he was.<br/><br/>What is so great about Rocky? There are various reasons, the storyline is a great part, underdog comes good against all odds, the acting is excellent (Stallone surely deserved an Oscar), the cinematography is perfect, the music is also absolutely spot on. The actual boxing is only a very small part of the film, it's the journey there that makes the film work.<br/><br/>Most people who don't appreciate Rocky forget the other parts of the film apart from the fighting. There is so much more that makes it the film it is. Baring in mind it beat Taxi Driver to best picture that year, Rocky must be something special. It may not be the best film ever made but for entertainment value it is up there somewhere.<br/><br/>An all time classic that has aged superbly, a must see.

Frazier would take whatever Ali threw, and keep coming. And Frazier was a Philadelphia hometown boy (with cameo in the movie). Definitely worth a look at the Ali/Frazier fights, just to give some perspective.<br/><br/>I saw Rocky on the big screen when it was released, and I was 10 years old.

","By law in the UK its compulsory for the Rocky Movies to be shown once every 6 months and so we're all something approaching experts on the Italian Stallion and his best bouts. I therefore humbly offer you the benefit of my country's Balboa expertise. Rocky's one of those movies that's pleasure tends to defy logical scrutiny. On paper its a fairly familiar archetypal inspirational drama about a poor boxer who gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world in a one-off for America's bicentenary dreamt up as a gimmick by the champ himself, Apollo Creed, to celebrate the countries mantle as the land of opportunity. Fairytale stuff then, except instead of getting to wear pink slippers and marry a prince, Balboa gets to have his brains smashed out in front of a baying for blood crowd. Obviously Rocky, who already looks as though he has brain damage from too many head blows, isn't thought to stand a chance. Creed's the champ after all, he's got all the money, all the experience - it'd be like me picking a fight with Mohammed Ali (in his heyday not now naturally, I'm not a complete bastard) and as Creed puts his feet up and awaits the walkover, the sound of etching can be heard as the Stallion's marble memorial is prepared. Can you see where this going? Of course you can and that's the point. Rocky is old fashioned Hollywood - adversity and long odds conquered by raw guts, determination and heart. It's what America is supposed to be all about and released in 1976 it was barely a shock that the gutter to the stars tale was rewarded with a best picture Oscar. Stallone's titular meathead makes for a likable hero. He may be dumber than a box of rubber swords but the semi-audible lug is a suitably endearing contrast with the arrogant Creed who wins on points (stetching credibility would be left to the sequels) but loses the battle for hearts and minds. If it's supremely entertaining it's because we're all a sucker for this kind of inspirational bilge. Rocky woos the demure object of his affections, runs up steps, trains hard and all to the emotive strings of Bill Conti, who goes a long way to wringing the last shred of cynicism out of the audience. It's never going to feature in your top hundred but Rocky packs a punch and we all know he really won the fight anyway."

The only complaint I have about it is that it is too basic a story and the characters have been seen in movies like this before. The main thing that saves it is the fact that even though Rocky doesn't win the big fight at the end, he still comes off as a winner at the end.

I consider it legalized violence, that people pay money to see, knowing that each blow to the head costs countless braincells. So, there is no way I would ever like a boxing movie. But Rocky isn't a boxing movie. It's not about boxing; it's about determination, will-power, and doing what you can to realize your dream. That's why I think Rocky is a great movie; it has something that everyone can relate to. Many people who watch this movie don't know the first thing about boxing, nor do they care about it(myself included); but everybody has a dream, something that they want to accomplish, something great they want to achieve at some point in their life. And that's why it's going to appeal to so many different people; everyone can relate to the theme: wanting to realize a dream. The plot is good, it moves along at a slow, steady pace, so you will need to be fairly patient with this film. Don't worry, the waiting pays off in the end. That I can promise you. The acting is pretty good, by pretty much everyone in the film, even Stallone, who I'm normally not at all impressed by. The characters are well-written, credible and likable(the ones we're supposed to like, at least). The story and theme is something that really sparks some interesting thought, especially since this was based on something that really happened. It's definitely one of Stallone's best films.

When I was a kid, my Dad used to go out jogging, and I used to laugh at him when he would play the theme song to Rocky on the turntable while he stretched.

Along the way, there are some subplots, (romance, tests of loyalty and friendship, greed) but its basic theme is his inspirational rise to the challenge and eventually, the fight.  The fight itself is very realistic, with the result even more so, and the ending is logically abrupt.

Sylvester Stallone seems like an intelligent guy, but if he had any sense, he would have let this film stand on its own. <br/><br/>Regardless, Rocky is an amazing movie because it's only a sports movie superficially. It's actually a character study--really, it's about two characters, Rocky and Adrian, and how this extraordinary event will change the lives of these two extremely ordinary people. Compare who they are at the beginning of the movie--a ""bum"" and a ""retard""--versus who they are at the end. <br/><br/>I still think the ending of the movie is extremely bold. A typical sports movie has the underdog win the big game. Not here--but Rocky does win. He recognizes his own limitations--something that we almost NEVER see characters doing in Hollywood movies. He knows he can't win, but sets a goal he CAN achieve that will prove--to everyone, especially himself--that he's more than they thought. <br/><br/>Looking back, I find the timing of the movie to be interesting: 1976. America had just come out of some of the worst experiences in its history: Vietnam, Watergate, inflation, the oil crisis. And in its bicentennial year, America makes a hit out of this film about a rough-around-the-edges guy making good, even though he gets battered and bruised and doesn't really win in the end.

From after the 3rd round when the music kicks in to when Apollo knocks Rocky out in the 14th and when Adrian is coming towards the ring, that whole sequence drives me crazy every time I see it.I want to cry, fight, and fly all at the same time. I think a big part of why the movie works so well is the musical score. The sequels are not as good, even though I think they're much better than what a lot of people think.10 out of 10."

","How the original 'Rocky' is not in the top 250 eludes me. This movie is THE strongest ""underdog"" movie of all time. BAR NONE. Sure the sequels were dodgy, but relevant i believe. But for Stallone, to come up with work of art of how a fighter from the gutter becomes heavyweight champ cannot be ignored. Superb acting from Stallone to bring HIS character 'Rocky' to life. This film is a brilliant example to everyone that nothing is impossible and nothing should get between you and your dreams<br/><br/>Spectacular<br/><br/>Long Live Rocky!!"
"agmoldham","7","0","2","14 March 2004"," The best Rocky
","This is the film that really rocketed Sylvester Stallone's career. He plays Rocky who is a journeyman professional boxer in Philadelphia. Apollo Creed is the World Champion who decides to give an unknown a shot at the title when a leading contender pulls out of a scheduled fight.<br/><br/>The film follows Rocky's two key relationships. His relationship with his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is certainly rocky. Rocky is also keen to woo Adrian (Talia Shire) who is a very shy pet shop assistant. These parts are all very nicely played and it is this that gives the film great depth. The fight scenes are nicely done and whilst the ending might be a bit ott it's forgivable. 9/10"
"Angry_Arguer","Null","0","2","7 January 2004"," Formula Now
","The 80s really started with 'Rocky'.  Here you have the popular formula, revised ever since, with the star now synonymous with monosyllable acting. This is as intelligent as the 'Rambo' films.<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>It's through the success of this and 'Jaws' that you can say the trend begins.  'Jaws' has held position because all its spin-offs have failed. With 'Rocky' there's 'Raging Bull', a more sophisticated film if not a smart film on its own.<br/><br/>This movie was recently remade under the name of 'Seabiscuit'.  Neither of them are well-crafted either as films or ""inspiring stories"".  'Braveheart' represents the epitome of this evil because it causes false sense of courage, luring the foolish to their doom.<br/><br/>Everything here is so ham-handed that it looks and sounds B-level by today's standards.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud"
"vchimpanzee","Null","0","1","14 September 2003"," well done, but not really my kind of movie
","Now I have finally seen the original.  Having seen II and V, I would definitely say this is the best of the three, though I didn't find it all that entertaining a lot of the time.  Here, Rocky doesn't seem like a loser, though the truth is that he is just a regular guy who is having trouble making it in the world.  He doesn't talk like he is brain-damaged nearly as much as he did in the other two movies, and when he does sound like a comic impression, it's not really that bad.  Sylvester Stallone's performance in this movie is more multi-dimensional compared to II and V.<br/><br/>Carl Weathers did a great job as the heavyweight champion who, for a gimmick, decided to fight an underdog.  And Burgess Meredith was quite good as the caring but sometimes nasty Mickey, who wanted to be Rocky's manager.  <br/><br/>There was not as much comedy in this movie as there was in II, but I liked the scene with Rocky and Adrian at the skating rink, and there was another scene in a meat storage facility where his friend Paulie worked, where Rocky demonstrated one of his training techniques for a TV camera--punching carcasses.<br/><br/>The arrangements of the theme song 'Gonna Fly Now' sounded better here than in II.  There was even one song at Rocky's apartment, which was played while he and Adrian were together, which sounded like it could have been the basis for 'Gonna Fly Now'. Or perhaps based on that theme song.<br/><br/>Of course, as in II, most of the excitement came toward the end, and the shots of Rocky training as well as running through Philadelphia were quite effective. <br/><br/>I can see why this movie was thought of as a classic.  It was good, but for me it wasn't great."

"cleanfilms","10","0","1","4 March 2003"," The most inspiring American film ever!
","Rocky is much more than just a boxing movie.  In fact, it really isn't about boxing at all.  It could be any subject, sport, etc.  The real story it about the American dream and about how, even though hard work cannot win you everything (remember he lost the championship against Apollo) you can be happy in life and win self-respect.  Not only is the movie incredibly inspiring and well made, but it is a shadow story of Stallone's life.  If one looks deep into this movie, and they don't worry about the other four films (which are only good for fun entertainment value if your a real Rocky-fan) than... you'll realize just how great this movie is.  Not too many films can make you believe in something so much, in such a realisitc manner.  IT IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER & MY PERSONAL FAVORITE!"

","Curiously enough, seen 25 years after it was originally made, this looks like an art film. If this were shot today in northern Italy with an Italian cast, the story would ring just as credibly, but have an art house look. By anyone's standards, this was a fine piece of film making. The quality of Stallone's performance is underestimated."
"acdance","9","0","1","30 October 2001"," Not Your Average Love Story
","People who say 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a good martial arts film would most likely say 'Rocky' is a good boxing film.  Well, in actuality, both of the movies are love stories.  As a matter of a fact, 'Rocky' only shows boxing scenes briefly at the very beginning, and of course you know about the feel good ending.  <br/><br/>Rocky Balboa's mind is on two things.  One, he wants to win very shy Adrian's love.  Two, he wants to prove himself and those around him that he's not a loser, by going distance with a champion Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>All the casts showed strong performance, from Adrian's bum brother Paulie, played by Burt Young to Rocky's tough love manager Mickey, played by Burgess Meredith.  And of course, the unforgettable sound track makes this movie even more enjoyable.<br/><br/>My only disappointment is that this movie is not in the IMDB's top 250 list. Why?  I mean movies like 'Clerks' and 'Matrix' are, but not 'Rocky'???<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10."

","I don´t like Sylvester Stallone at all but he has done two good roles: This and Cop land.<br/><br/>
The typical ""sport""  story about the boxer who gives his all to win the championship.The boxing scenes are nothing special and you understand how it going to end in the start.<br/><br/>Still the film has a heart and it´s very hard to hate so I give this a 3/5.I have not seen all of the other rocky films but I have seen some parts of the other  films on cabel-tv and that look just like trash.<br/><br/>

"Shapster11","Null","0","1","24 September 2001"," An underdog film, actor, and character all win here!
","In the mid 1970's Sylvester Stallone was a married man with limited acting experience, no money in the bank, and only an idea for a story which in many ways was semi-autobiographical. Despite being broke, with a baby on the way, Stallone shopped his story of a pug club fighter given the opportunity of a lifetime to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. It was a loose story based on Chuck Wepner's fight with Muhammed Ali. But it was also about perseverance, opportunity, and then raw guts...all of which Stallone exhibited by rejecting a $400,000 offer for the script that would have had another actor play the role Stallone said was his...that of Rocky Balboa.<br/><br/>Finally with assurances in hand that he would play Balboa the film was made, but it was low budget. None the less this film took critics and the movie public by storm. Men and women fell in love with the bullish southpaw club fighter from Philly, the Italian Stallion, and people flocked to theatres. With some outstanding support from Talia Shire (Adrienne), Burt Young (Paulie), and the late great Burgess Meredith as Mick this film took the Academy Award for Best Picture. I believe only two factors prevented Stallone from winning the Best Actor award that year. The untimely death, and great performance, of Peter Finch in Network and, to a probably lesser degree, a simmering resentment toward this relative newcomer (Stallone) to the Hollywood superstar club. Sometimes the Academy will reward a new fresh face and sometimes the underlying message is ""earn our respect"". This was probably Stallone's best opportunity to be awarded the prestigious gold statue as his future films were in the super-heroic, action character segment which can do, and did do, great at the box office but does not often resonate with the academy.<br/><br/>Someday I believe the academy will present Stallone a lifetime achievement award in recognition of years of contribution to the movie making community and an acknowledgment of his international appeal."

The movie is great, the storyline interesting, the music inspiring and encouraging plus the actors are terrific, especially Stallone and Talia Shire.  The love story is fantastic and when Sylvester Stallone works out, you can really learn a lot, like drinking raw eggs for morning.  All in all, one of the greatest stories ever told."

","My all time favourite film would have to be the one about an unknown boxer who's given the chance of a lifetime when he goes up against Apollo Creed for the Heavyweight Champion of the World.And that film is Rocky. Rocky only took 28 days to make and didn't cost very much. Sylvester Stallone is brilliant as Rocky Balboa the lovable boxer and he also wrote the film. Talia Shire is superb as the shy and meek Adrian. And who could forget Burt Young in his great role playing Adrian's loser brother. Carl Weathers is superb as the Jive talking Apollo Creed. I just love this film. I'm 11 years old and I'm a huge movie buff and know heaps about movies,I love to drive my friends crazy when I talk about Rocky. I even did my speech on the Rocky films this year and got a very good mark. This film was awarded with The best picture Oscar,The best Director Oscar and the best cinematography oscar. Sadly Sylvester Stallone did not win Best Actor or best Screenplay which is very sad because it was probably his only chance judging by his latest movies. I don't really know why I like this film so much I mean the sequels probably mellow out this films impact but this is the very best Rocky. I highly recommend this film. 10/10!"
"TERMINATOR180","10","0","1","9 August 2001"," The greatest Boxing movie of all time
","Even if you don't like Boxing, you will enjoy Rocky. It is a film about Courage, and proving to yourself that you're not ""just another bum"". This film might even get you into boxing! Not only did Rocky have to try to go to the distance, but Stallone did also. This was one of his first films, and he had to prove himself as an actor. I'd suggest buying the whole DVD set, I did, and it is a magnificent collection of the greatest movies to hit the silver screen."

"TomTomTom","10","0","1","15 August 2000"," The greatest movie ever made.
","The best movie of all time.  Period.  Everyone knows the basic plot of Rocky by now, but you must understand the way it is developed.  Stallone spends the first part of the script showing what a nobody Rocky really is.  Then he shows how Apollo Creed is looking for a joke; he doesn't want a boxing match, he wants someone with a funny name to beat up.  He is in for surprise..."
"croc (DRM)","Null","0","2","30 May 2000"," Subtle, well crafted drama about a no-hoper
","Whilst the Rocky name mainly conjures up the image of over-the-top Hollywood block-busters with 2 heavyweight boxers slugging it out unrealistically until their faces are mangled for the final third of the film; the original film has very little of this. In fact the boxing is quite secondary in some ways and the main idea of the film is Rocky learning to sort out his life.<br/><br/>Arguably, this film comes close to becoming a social drama, although the underlying concept of an out-of-condition club boxer becoming a world champion contender in 5 weeks does stretch credibility and keeps nagging at the brain. Still it was one of the first of its kind, and for the subtle way in which it was done, which still leaves you with the feel good factor, it must be one of the best."
"darth_sidious","Null","0","3","22 May 2000"," I wanted to love this film, but...
","I really wanted to love this film but I didn't. The problem is that I didn't see enough of Rocky's rise to the fight. I want to know what he goes through to get to the big event. There simply isn't enough to make me cheer for Rocky.<br/><br/>Why would Apollo want to fight someone like Rocky? It's not realistic.<br/><br/>I didn't feel sorry for Rocky or his girlfriend. The 2nd act required beefing up. Some of the film is terrific. I love the gritty city, it looks very realistic at times, a dirty city. The direction is good. But the script required beefing up in the middle. The performances are good. This isn't about boxing, but the rise of a hero from the slums of life. I wished it work better!"

He's written off and expected to be the latest in a long line of losers, but with the help of his no-nonsense trainer (a powerhouse Meredith) and his own burning desire, he makes it his mission to try and shock the world. A simple but involving underdog/beating the odds story that's exciting, convincing, and without a doubt unforgettable. One of those rare movies that's worthy of all its praise and deserves to be called a classic. ****"
