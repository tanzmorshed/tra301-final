","I was supposed to be be seeing either Flight or Argo today, but to my disappointment I missed both showtimes, and I was in a tight time frame where I could see anything. So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how ""pretty"" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. <br/><br/>Overall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it. Highly recommended."
"FairlyAnonymous","9","129","141","3 November 2012"," A lot better than expected, and made for gamers
","Side note: The animated short Paper Man was very good. The animation was a unique blend of CGI but made to look like hand drawn animation. The only slight issue I had with it is that the short got crazy at the end and became unbelievable. Still cute.<br/><br/>Being a gamer, I decided to go to this movie. I knew the movie was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be really good. The action, humor, voice-acting, plot, and animation are all great. Since this movie is aimed towards gamers, I feel like a lot of the cameos and jokes are going to fly over most people's heads, such as ""All your base are belong to us"" written on a subway wall or ""Leroy Jenkins was here"". Thankfully, the movie doesn't rely on cameos to be successful.<br/><br/>The animation in Wreck-It Ralph is very beautiful, and is great at expressing the video game world. I did not see it in 3D, but just from watching it in 2D I can tell that this movie would look amazing in 3D. The animators did really good in this movie because each video game world looks vastly different from another. Each world feels like an actual video game that I've played. If there is one problem that I can pick out in this movie (and many others have noted this as well) is that the plot focuses on the Sugar Rush world a bit too much. Most of the other worlds are revealed at the beginning mainly for the sake of reference, with only a few actually being important.<br/><br/>The humor in Wreck-It Ralph is good because it hits a very large audience. A lot of the cameos and jokes are related to video games but there are also a lot of movie references as well, puns, slapstick jokes, and some crude humor. Some people complained at the crude humor but honestly it didn't bother me because it was coming from a character who looks like she is five, so it actually made sense.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about Wreck-It Ralph's plot is that it has very little to do with an external conflict, but more with an internal one (which is a pun in itself because they are inside of video games). There is a main bad guy, and a huge disaster, and all of these other conflicts but these elements are back seat to the character development. I thought it was neat since most animated movies do the opposite. The voices for all of the characters were really well done. There weren't any annoying characters which adds to the movie. Another nice thing about the plot is that main bad guy is not revealed until the very end of the movie which focuses the plot on the characters, not the action or the villain.<br/><br/>Overall a really great movie. Spectacular animation, great voice work, emotional and even touching at times, and overall humorous. While the Sugar Rush world might get slightly stale after awhile, it is still excellent movie. Gamers, this goes to you, WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
"peteer01","10","195","219","2 November 2012"," Even better than I'd hoped
","Let me start by saying this: I am the ideal demographic for this movie. I am in my early/mid 30s, I grew up with videos games starting with the ColecoVision 30 years ago, which is, in the movie, when Wreck-It Ralph was released. I still play games. I have a four-year-old son who plays games. He knows who Pac-Man, Zangief and Sonic are, and you can bet that on top of that I know who Sheng Long, Tapper, Q*Bert and Burger Time are.<br/><br/>That's what makes me nervous about blanketly recommending this movie to everyone...not just that I'm obviously going to catch more references, in-jokes and cameos than the average movie goer, but that I'm going to recognize the archetypes they're playing off of and the mechanics they're referencing as the stories progresses.<br/><br/>It feels a bit like Mallrats, in that I'm so ideally in the target demographic for the movie's release that I'm not sure I can accurately gauge how it will be received by people outside of that demographic.<br/><br/>That said, I don't think you need to be a video game fan to enjoy this movie. It's a very well crafted movie with characters that are more Pixar than Disney. I was concerned that this was a ""Disney"" movie as I haven't seen a 3D CG ""Disney"" movie that can hold a candle to the Pixar and Dreamworks hits that I'm a huge fan of. And yet, for me, this movie was better than recent Pixar movies and better than Dreamworks movies, with characters and a story that felt worthy of of the Pixar name.<br/><br/>I even greatly enjoyed the animated short at the beginning. Again, something I would expect more from a Pixar film than a Disney film. The whole theater experience for this film was a delight, all the way through to the very, very brief bonus scene at the end of a credits, which is something you really, really need to be a gaming nerd to get. (Gamers who have seen The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters will definitely get it.) I went into this film with high hopes and expectations, and I was blown away. My wife, who is not a gamer at all, enjoyed the film, and when my four-year-old son was asked by her what his favorite part was, he replied, ""Um... Every part! I liked the whole movie!"" That he was able to talk to her and I in great detail about the plot and characters while I was able to appreciate the whole film to the level I did as an adult speaks volumes to me about how well this story was told.<br/><br/>If you played in arcades in the 1980s, if the games Q*Bert, Burgertime, Pac-Man, Street Fighter II and Sonic all mean something to you: You're enough of a gamer to appreciate all the references. If you have a youngster who's played video games, they're enough of a gamer to get the movie. And even if you aren't, while you may not relate to the subject matter the way I did, you're still in for an enjoyable story, with great characters, masterfully told.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, and a 10 out of 10 for me, as I expect this will be on both my son's and my short list of favorite movies for years to come."
"manuscriptna","9","99","109","2 November 2012"," A wonderful, nostalgic, and artful cinematic experience~
","It's all fun and games at Litwak's Fun Center, until someone gets hurt. While this clich√©'d line seems to reflect the simple plot in most movies (while the moral outcome does, too), the setting makes Wreck-it Ralph a wonderful, refreshing, and unique pleasure. Inside a family arcade, all the game characters (both old and new) are real, and travel among the other games when the doors have locked. Ralph, from Fix-it Felix Jr., desperately wished to be a good guy, and be rewarded, so he sets off in search of a medal. By doing this, he sets off a chain of events that puts multiple games at risk, and unveils a hidden threat.<br/><br/>Disney has made this film equally accessible by both parents and children, and I find that wondrous. At times, Vanellope sounded quite mature, and at others, just like a tod. Soon, kids will squeal in excitement when they find a Fix-it Felix Jr. game, along with other last-gen arcade delights. In this way, the film has rendered itself timeless, if only in that small way. Although it doesn't feature many of the games themselves, you are able to see many characters, including retired ones.<br/><br/>Being inside a game world gave the artists a great deal of freedom, but they didn't waste it. At every new turn, another extremely creative point would grab your attention, and I'm sure I missed many (which would enhance a second viewing). Another big enhancement is the 3D atmosphere. I doubted I would ever say this, but I urge you to see this in 3D, or turn around and go home. Because of all the pixel-related artwork, and 3D modeling, it is natural to have such a dimension added on. It's the perfect film to have it for!<br/><br/>Now, for all the extra material surrounding the movie. Similar to Pixar, Disney has included an animated short right before, called ""The Paperman"". It doesn't feature any voice acting, but it's hilarious, and very well-made. I am sure you'll enjoy it. Second, the end credits are worth watching through, but not because there's an extra scene (there isn't one). It's only worth it for the visuals during the credits themselves, in 3D.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Wreck-it Ralph is family-safe, and highly enjoyable. See it in 3D as soon as you can!"
"DrSaintDDS","10","231","269","2 November 2012"," BRILLIANT! The best animated film of the year!
","Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game called ""Sugar Rush"". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.<br/><br/>I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever ‚Äì a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.<br/><br/>So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave (which was also very good).<br/><br/>John C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character, who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the ""Sugar Rush"" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a ""glitch"" (a character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock) has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main character in a first-person shooter game known as ""Hero's Duty"", who tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.<br/><br/>I didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp, pristine screen.<br/><br/>The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.<br/><br/>The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.<br/><br/>Generally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this movie, they're going to fall in love with it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"jediguitarguy","8","216","256","26 October 2012"," Even better than I hoped....
","Got to see an advances screening of Wreck-it Ralph today. I had been waiting for at least a year for this film and it did not disappoint. <br/><br/>I am a hardcore Disney fanboy and was before I even played my first video game. But I have to be honest, sometimes Disney doesn't get it. They see something is trending and an instant money maker and jump head first even if they don't understand the topic they're tackling. <br/><br/>So it does make you wonder if they could really do justice to a film dedicated to something they really don't excel in. Video games are not Disney's strong suit(except for the rare cases like Kingdom Hearts, which really only succeeds, because they have little to nothing to do with the production). Trust me I've played enough cheap marketing/movie tie in/ buy it for your kid because of the characters on the box Disney games to know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>But Wreck-it Ralph nailed it. Start to Finish it is a love letter to gaming, made by people who understand games(and I highly suspect John Lasseter's role as Executive Producer greatly contributed to it's excellence).<br/><br/>It really reminded me of why we love games. It's not the technology or the graphics or the marketing hype. It's what they make us feel. The broad range of emotions they extract from us as we immerse ourselves in their world. The joy of victory, the stinging pain of loss, laughter and even tears. I felt all of those in this movie. <br/><br/>The world has become an ugly place and personally, my faith is what gets me through. But when you experience a game or a movie that takes you to an imaginative world where anything is possible, things start to seem a little brighter. Those stacks of paperwork you're facing seem smaller. The grisly news headlines get a little further away. That's what art and beauty do. They heal; help us see things in a better light. And I thank God for them.<br/><br/>I didn't expect for the movie to get me waxing philosophical, but that's the kind of hairpin I am.<br/><br/>Side notes: I was a little disappointed that they lingered SO long in one environment and I, frankly, find the crude humor tiresome. I thought the 3D was excellent, providing a nice immersive depth and texture without ever seeming gimicky( and I'm not a die hard 3D fan). Also, be sure to get there in time for the short at the beginning, Paper Man. Reminded me of classic Disney animated shorts, and that is not a bad thing.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago I was leaving California Adventure Park and overheard a little boy talking to his father about Wreck-it Ralph. With the wide eyed enthusiasm of youth he said to his father, ""It's a movie about video games....who doesn't like that?"" Well said, kid, well said."
"gregeichelberger","7","14","14","4 November 2012"," Games people play: 'Wreck-It' is a nostalgically fun look back
","With a mix of ""Alien,"" ""Toy Story"" and a bit of originality, Walt Disney Studios has created a wonderfully fun and nostalgic effort sure to put a smile on the faces of young and old, alike.<br/><br/>And while a bit long in the tooth for an animated film (108 minutes), ""Wreck-It Ralph"" nevertheless is one of the better productions of this genre in 2012, at least.<br/><br/>For those who grew up in the video game world, say post 1978, the sights and sounds of this movie will no doubt have many viewers pointing at the screen in recognition of the many, many classic arcade characters and machines (and even some of the newer systems, as well).<br/><br/>Much of the charm of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is based upon these recollections as characters from Street Fighter, Q-Bert, Sonic, Frogger, Dig-Dug, Donkey Kong, Super Mario Brothers, Halo, Mortal Kombat, Ms. Pac-Man, among many others abound in their own world when the neighborhood arcade closes for the night.<br/><br/>Plotwise, the hulking but sensitive title character (voiced by John C. Reilly, ""Step Brothers"") has been destroying the same apartment building for more than 30 years in an older than old school game entitled ""Fix-It Felix, Jr.,"" but all he has to show for it is constantly being thrown off a roof and living a lonely, depressing life in a huge pile of bricks.<br/><br/>The game's perpetually perky hero, Felix, Jr. (voiced by Jack McBrayer, ""30 Rock""), however, is forever honored with shiny medals and feted by the structure's residents for repairing Ralph's damage with his magic golden hammer.<br/><br/>Having had enough, Ralph confesses the desire to be a good guy ‚Äî for a change ‚Äî to members of his bad guy support group. Here, various villains led by a ghost from Pac-Man spout AA and Narcano platitudes, such as ""Good is not bad, Ralph, and bad is good,"" but he is determined to be the hero and win a medal for himself ‚Äî even just once.<br/><br/>And so his adventure through the games of Litwik's Fun Center begins.<br/><br/>First, after removing the armor-plating of an inebriated soldier, Ralph enters the world of ""Hero's Duty"" to kill bugs and climb buildings. Although petrified and frustrated, he still manages to swipe a huge medal by trickery and brute force.<br/><br/>Then, upon escaping in a space pod (with a virus bug stowaway), he crash lands in the sickeningly sweet world of ""Sugar Rush,"" where cute-as-a-button racers drive home-baked go-karts in a land ruled by King Candy (voice of Alan Tudyk, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" doing his best Ed Wynn).<br/><br/>Here, Ralph also meets the pixilated ""glitch"" Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman, ""The School of Rock""), who steals his unearned medal as an entry fee for the race she is never allowed to participate in. The two form a reluctant alliance based upon the fact the winner will get a medal. She promises to win and he wrecks a bakery to make her a candy-coated race car.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Felix, Jr. and the leader from ""Hero's Duty,"" Calhoun (Jane Lynch, ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" ""Glee""), are frantically searching for the AWOL Ralph. If they cannot find him, ""Fix-It Felix, Jr."" will be disconnected and the characters forced to live on the streets of Game Central Station.<br/><br/>The duo are also trying to fight off an invasion of huge deadly bugs who are trying to take over ""Sugar Rush,"" as well. There's a lot of gunfire, explosions, last-minute rescues, a big auto race and derring-do. There is also a little romance and even a lot of heart in this story of trying to improve oneselves all the while attempting to maintain one's core personality and individualism.<br/><br/>Things are not always as they seem, but the overall look and feel of Wreck-It Ralph is a bright, splashing, colorful world that draws laughs and ""Ohhhs"" from parents as well as their children.<br/><br/>Although do be warned, very young children may be frightened by some of the darker moments ‚Äî the movie is rated PG for a reason.<br/><br/>Gamers, teens, twenty-somethings and many others will also enjoy most of this film, although it tends to sag a bit in the middle and could have used a bit more judicious editing (maybe 10 minutes could have been shorn).<br/><br/>Nonetheless, director Rich Moore (some ""Futurama"" and ""Drawn Together"" episodes) exhibits a deft hand in his animated lexicon and ""Wreck-It Ralph"" certainly showcases that ability."
"perfectdark401","10","133","157","2 November 2012"," By far one of their greatest work in quite some time
","I have to say that I was a bit surprised to see how well this was thought out, the director and the animators put their hearts and souls into making this movie with their special effects and amazing plot line laced with funny humor for both ages (young with the new-gen gaming and the old with retro-gaming). But not only is it funny, but very well thought out and well played.<br/><br/>The characters were very well thought out and planned to show how it would be if a old-styled video game character would do in the after-hours when no one was around, they opened the door to a untapped imagination that blew me away. The originality behind the video game characters brings the term nostalgic to a whole new level.<br/><br/>They also did an amazing job with the little girl named Vanellope and how her story unfolded, with surprising twists and turns to keep things rather interesting. Not only did they did a great job on the plot but also on the aesthetics of visual effects and gestures as well; Vanellope's character really blossomed because of this (as well as the other characters too).<br/><br/>Ralph is one of those characters that you kinda hate being around with and shows that off by his enormous size (and his ape-like hands), he's a bad guy by code but he shows that when there's a will there's a way and Ralph eventually figures it out sprinkled with laughs along his crazy journey to save the day.<br/><br/>An amazing job on the visuals, the story line, the character development, the overall plot, and most of all is how they managed to weave all these threads together into a solid movie for everyone. One of Disney's greatest works to be produced in a rather long time and really worth seeing again and again."
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","10","12","12","5 November 2012"," With an emotional story, lots of nostalgic references, and nice development, Wreck-It Ralph wins the game!
","When I have heard that Disney was going to make a new movie this time about a video game arcade with some of the 80s greatest video games ever made, I was really excited and wanted to see this with lots of expectations. I started to like the premise: A bad-guy named Ralph from a video game called ""Fix-It Felix"" who wants to be a hero instead of being the villain all the time and goes to both games to receive a medal. So, he goes to Hero's Duty and Sugar Rush where there he meets a girl named Vannellope and makes a friendship with her as she tries to win a race so she can become a racer before they make a deal to win and give Ralph a medal. It's kind of like Toy Story but instead of toys, it takes place in a video game arcade.<br/><br/>With that said, I saw this on the opening weekend starting from last night and was blown away. It succeeded what it had set out to do and delivered what the trailers had promised. Before I can get to the redeeming qualities, there is one flaw that I would like to point out. There is some nice messaging, but there are some really dark moments that could frighten kids ages 8-10 especially the tragic back-story of Calhoun, one of the characters of the movie.<br/><br/>Flaw aside, everything else exceeded my expectations towards this wonderful movie. The story is very original with some really happy moments, some sad moments, and like I said before, some dark moments that I've already stated and has a very nice concept that would not only remind the adults of the 80s video game references (especially some nice cameos including: Bowser, Dr. Eggman, the ghost from Pac-Man, some Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter characters, and Sonic), but will entertain them as well as the kids young and old. The characters, like the story, are also original with lots of help from a great voice cast including John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch, Dennis Haysbert, and Alan Tudyk. Wreck-It Ralph is a determined protagonist who changes his life and tries to achieve it be becoming what he wants to be and his development between him and Vanellope, an adorable girl from Sugar Rush who wants to become the best race-car driver, is well-thought out. Some of the characters like, Fix-It Felix, Calhoun, whose tragic back-story made me felt sorry for her, and several of the video game characters are also likable, but the most memorable character goes to the main villain, King Candy. He reminds me of Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland except he's not only menacing, but unbelievably over-the-top it's hard not to forget this villain.<br/><br/>The pacing for this movie is very brisk and moves along very nicely and I like the music from Henry Jackman. It has some nice 80s video game music and the orchestra for several moments of the movie is beautifully well-made. The strongest aspect, however, goes to the animation and boy was it so amazing. The character animation on the Wreck-It Ralph and several of the video game characters are creative and look exactly like the ones from the 80s video games, but what stands out most about the animation is it's visuals. Everything you see in just blows you away. The bright colors, the set ups and the environments of the video games which makes it look completely gorgeous especially the Game Central Station and it's some of the greatest visuals I've ever seen in an animated feature film since Dreamwork's ""How To Train Your Dragon"", ""Kung Fu Panda"" and several of Pixar's films including the ""Toy Story"" trilogy, ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"", and ""Cars"".<br/><br/>Overall, Wreck-It Ralph delivered what it had promised: an emotional story, lots of great nostalgic references, and nice development from the characters which makes this, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the year and the most anticipated movie next to ""The Hunger Games"" and ""John Carter"" My advice: Go see it! It is really *that* good!"
"billygoat1071","9","77","94","9 November 2012"," Virtual Joys
","Wreck-It Ralph imagines a world where arcade game characters have their own lives. It's like a video game version of Toy Story and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but this one is much more appealing to the viewers. As expected, it has an endless amount of enjoyment, a big scale of adventure, and really fun characters. The filmmakers poured their love of these games to the film thus made this a wonderful nostalgic delight.<br/><br/>The story doesn't sound quite fresh at some point, especially for an animated film, but the main attraction here is the theme. It sets in a magnificent arcade world. It's fun when it captures the prominent video game mannerism like the freezy movements in retro games, an out of control game character walking against the wall in 3D games, and the glitching. It's easy to know what the central games are inspired from. Many would root for the cameos of iconic game characters and each of their appearance are splendid. The movie is filled with action set pieces that are undeniably exciting. By its grand scale and references, the experience is gloriously extraordinary.<br/><br/>Another charms of the film is the characters. We don't usually see films with well developed characters in blockbusters these days but this one has plenty of it. They all have their own pathos, but in a comical way. And the voice performances were great. John C. Reily gives Ralph an acceptably nice personality. Sarah Silverman makes Vanellope adorable enough. Jack McBrayer is quite charming as the always positive Fix-It Felix Jr. and Alan Tudyk is delightful as the goofy King Candy.<br/><br/>The animation is wonderful. Like what I said, they really capture the elements of every video game. The game ""Sugar Rush"" has the most colorful(and product placed) visuals of the film. The rest is thoroughly inspired. 3D is usually unnecessary but here is just fine. It's kind of worth it by its large adventures. There is no scene after the credits but it's better to stay during it to listen to the theme songs of ""Sugar Rush"" and ""Fix-It Felix Jr."".<br/><br/>There isn't much groundbreaking about Wreck-It Ralph but what makes this special is its tribute to the classic video games. It also serves an over the top fun and sweetness(no Sugar Rush pun intended). It's so fun, it's easy to ignore its little flaws. There are some things that could have been better, but the film is already good enough. To those who love playing video-games will enjoy this a lot more. It's just full of life and nostalgia. Wreck-It Ralph is a great virtual ride!"

"TheLittleSongbird","10","14","15","9 February 2013"," Best animated film of 2012? Absolutely!
","I think 2012 has been a very good, even great, year for animation in that I don't think I have seen an animated film I've disliked. Wreck It Ralph for me was the best animated film from 2012(although it only came out yesterday in the UK I still class it as a 2012 film), tying with Tangled as the best Disney has done since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It has something for children and adults alike, and I don't think you have to be a video game fan to like it(I'm not exactly, more of Disney myself, but am very familiar with them through my brother). The animation is wonderful, the characters move with no problem at all, the colours look gorgeous and the backgrounds are detailed, very like the very best of Pixar actually. The music, right from the tempos, rhythms, melodies, chord progressions and instrumentation, is full of energy and the songs are incredibly catchy. The writing is a perfect blend of humour and heart, the film is often hilarious and witty as well as heartfelt and touching in equal measures and the story is fast-paced and much more original than you'd think complete with energetic-but not too frantic- action. I like the Be Youself message, it is an important one and I personally didn't think it was heavy-handed. And of course any video game fan will love spotting the video game characters and references, there's plenty of them and all are colourfully evoked. I found it very easy to relate to Ralph, Fix-it Felix Jr is an amusing character and Vanellope is cute without being annoying or mawkish. The voice work is terrific, with the standout being the gruff vulnerability that John C Reilly brings to Ralph. In conclusion, a wonderful film and the best animated film of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"misterembryo","9","33","40","2 November 2012"," Disney headed in the right di-WRECK-tion!
","The trailer alone, garnered much buzz for Disney's latest 3D adventure. Seeing some of'the great video game villains of all time assembled in one room was just too good to be true. The hype was elevated to even greater heights given its ubiquitous presence at San Diego Comic Con. In the back of mind I kept thinking, ""THEY'RE GONNA WRECK IT!""<br/><br/>Thankfully, the movie succeeds in creating a heartfelt tribute to the golden era of the 80's arcade, decorated here and there with familiar cameos that are both nostalgic and laugh out loud hilarious. The actual video game characters and their respective worlds don't play as big a role in the movie as I imagined. My wishful, nerdy brain hoped Ralph would be jumping through pipes in Mushroom Kingdom, riding horseback through Hyrule and blasting away at baddies alongside Mega Man and who knows who else. This didn't happen, and may have to do with the price of buying the rights to some of these iconic images. But the new world Disney Animation Studios created is rich with surprises, and rivals that of Monstropolis, Toy Story, and the Kingdom of Far and Far Away. <br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by the incomparable John C. Reilly) is the Donkey Kong to Fix-It Felix, Jr.'s Mario in a fictional 80's arcade game. The game itself is believable enough to have existed during the era. Ralph, along with other villains in various games throughout the ages, share the same plight of feeling under-appreciated by gamers and other citizens of the video game world. <br/><br/>The breaking point for Ralph was the 30th Anniversary for the ""Fix-it Felix, Jr."" arcade. To commemorate the event, Felix throws a party in the penthouse of the game's high-rise apartment complex, a party that Ralph wasn't invited to. (The DJ of this party offered another cameo I really wasn't expecting and left me in awe of this tribute to electronic art.) <br/><br/>What sets Ralph apart from all the other villains is that he is determined to actually do something about the unfortunate role of ""Bad Guy"" he was programmed to assume. He intends to jump to different arcades in order to become a hero in another game. This act of invading a game other than your own is mysteriously referred to as ""Going Turbo"" by the other inhabitants of the video game world. It's considered taboo, especially since it runs the risk of permanent death: dying outside your own game makes it impossible to regenerate.<br/><br/>After a series of unfortunate events, Ralph eventually crash lands into Sugar Rush, a cross between the worlds of Candy Land and Mario Kart. There he befriends the adorable Vanellope (voiced by the lovely Sarah Silverman), who like Ralph is seen as an outcast in her game. In her case, she is considered a freak due to her tendency to glitch out. To Vanellope, racing runs deep within her code, but the only thing stopping her is the candy land's ruler the Candy King, who is adamant on keeping her out of the race.<br/><br/>Ralph's spontaneous hero's journey spells trouble for the rest of the video game world. Due to Ralph's disappearance, the ""Fix-it Felix, Jr."" game is in danger of being unplugged, leaving Felix with the hefty responsibility of retrieving his clumsy counterpart. Ralph's brief stint in a Halo-esque game called ""Hero's Duty"" is also a big nuisance to the foxy Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch). She must now track down and exterminate a Cybug that Ralph mistakenly helped escape from the game. If the bug goes viral, it could destroy every game in Mr. Litwak's entire arcade for good.<br/><br/>The video game setting offers awesome moments of creativity for the Disney animators, from the way the characters are drawn and animated, to the way their lives are portrayed outside of their own game. The voice talent is also really impressive across the board. While the movie isn't the all-out Smash Brothers brawl many were expecting, the movie comes with loads of surprises that are sure to delight and entertain a wide audience, gamers and non-gamers alike.<br/><br/>The movie could not have come at a better time. People who grew up during the era of the arcade are now starting to have families of their own, and are very likely to laugh along with the children they bring to the theaters. This same video game generation also witnessed the Disney Renaissance of the early 90's: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and the Lion King. With Wreck-It Ralph destined to be an instant classic, following the success of the equally impressive Tangled, we are in for a new Disney Renaissance for a whole new generation.<br/><br/>Note: Get there early enough for an excellent animated short, and stay to watch the credits roll if you haven't yet satisfied your nerdy gamer fix."
"ChristianUnchained","10","49","62","3 November 2012"," A New Classic
","The Short: Wreck-It Ralph is a classic. From the slick animation, the great sense of humor, nostalgia inducing references and cameos, and the surprisingly adept and emotional story, Disney's Wreck-it Ralph is the best animated comedy since Tangled, and one of Disney's best animated films ever crafted.<br/><br/>Street Fighter, Pac-Man, Q-bert; widely known and considered classic games. But a ""new challenger has entered the ring"" in the form of old school, Donkey Kong inspired retro arcade game, Wreck-it Ralph. Follow the misadventures of Wreck-it Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, as he attempts to become a hero by jumping though various video games. I don't want to spoil any of the plot, but it is incredibly well told and is quite surprising in the end. It has that classic Disney emotion, but with a most unique ""video game-y"" twist. In the end, Wreck-it Ralph teaches some great lessons, but it is also neither mundane nor juvenile, and that's why it's a winner. <br/><br/>The cast here couldn't fit the characters better. John C. Reilly as the big guy Wreck-it Ralph, Sarah Silverman as the spirited and surprisingly funny Vanellope von Schweetz, Jane Lynch as the stoic and hilarious Sergeant Calhoun, and Jack McBrayer as the lovable and yet again laugh- out-loud Fix-it Felix Junior. The movie is absolutely hilarious; the performances from all of the actors fit their roles perfectly and couldn't be funnier. They couldn't have picked a better voice cast, honestly to goodness. <br/><br/>The animation continues the high pedigree that Disney has become famous for. Its bright and lively action is wonderful to watch, and combined with great facial animations make for a great and emotional experience. But the winner here is the way that they have adapted the old- school style of video game animation into the film itself. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. It makes for a truly unique, one of a kind experience! Sony's 4K presentation is crisp and vibrant.<br/><br/>The thing to understand though is that with its focus on video game cameos and references, don't worry! You don't have to have any knowledge of video games to understand or enjoy Wreck-it Ralph. The story and main characters are all part of the film's story and world. Rather than using the references as a crutch, they're used more as a springboard into new and unexplored fictional worlds.<br/><br/>Granted, gamers of all ages are going to love the care and attention taken when putting in the huge amount of references, cameos, and little bits of easter eggs spritzed and scattered throughout Wreck-it Ralph, making for a truly nostalgic inducing experience. <br/><br/>And those classic Disney trademarks, from great characters to a well told story, are all here and are much more than side attractions. The twist is great, the concepts are fresh, and the level of imagination at work revives my faith in the animated genre. There's still plenty left in this old dog after all.<br/><br/>And so I have to end this review by asking, ""Are you tired of the same old washed up animated feature film? Feel like you're just too old for childish animated movies?"" Wreck-it Ralph is the perfect cure. And it's meant for that group of movie goers looking for something more than just another animated money pit. It's laugh out loud funny, exciting and fresh, incredibly inventive and gleefully unique at every turn. <br/><br/>It's a classic no doubt, and Wreck-it Ralph will be one of those movies on my ""favorites"" shelf for decades to come. The true triumph? Wreck-it Ralph feels like that classic game that has been a part of my childhood ever since I can remember; the type of classic where you throw hundreds of quarters away and you honestly just don't care, because it is just that good. <br/><br/>5/5 - Perfection; Stop reading and watch right now"
"Lyra-gp","10","15","17","30 December 2012"," Wreck me Ralph, please!
","Since the release of its very first trailer, a long time ago, Wreck it Ralph has always appeared as one of the most promising animated flicks of the year. Having seen the movie, I have changed my mind: It's not just one of the best animated movies, it's one of the best movies (or maybe the best) of the year. <br/><br/>I don't like to make Disney/Pixar comparisons, but this time Disney has outdone itself. Compared to Brave (which was good enough), Wreck it Ralph is a very strong movie, based on a complex, fresh and original story involving the video games world. I think this is the first step in the process of creating an animated movie: to find a fresh, involving idea. Every small detail, every character seems to perfectly fit in this magical world behind one of the most diffused hobbies in the world. This is undoubtedly Disney at its best. <br/><br/>In Wreck it Ralph there are not boring parts, you can laugh or be scared, be moved or even be thrilled but you will hardly yawn while watching this movie. During the projection, I literally burst out with laughters, as the movies presents many funny situations. It's a real pleasure to follow the story and to enjoy every small detail present in the movie.<br/><br/>The characters are very 'toony' but at the same time they seem to be real and very believable. There are no clich√©s or stereotypes, everything is fruit of the ingenious minds working at Disney. For example, if you asked me 'who's your favorite character?' I couldn't answer because they're all great and funny. Ranging from Ralph to Vannelope, from Felix to King Candy, every character is perfectly portrayed. <br/><br/>But Wreck it Ralph is not just a way to laugh and pass a couple of entertaining hours: it's far more than that. Not only the film is full of references to the video game world, but it contains lots of references to movies and modern world themes. It's even full of reflections upon life, in the typical Disney style.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake is the ending. I will not spoil anything about it, I will just say that it's astonishing and very unpredictable. To put it in a funny way, I would say that it's one of the best thrillers I've seen this year! <br/><br/>Finally, two words for the soundtrack. Henry Jackman ost is catching and enjoyable. In some cases, it's a mix between music and the sounds of old 8bit video games. In particular, I really appreciated the track 'Arcade Life' and 'Arcade Ending'. The end credits song, 'When can I see you again' by Owl city is also truly enjoyable. <br/><br/>I think Wreck it Ralph is not just one of the best animated flicks of the year, but it's one of the best movies of 2012. Disney has outdone itself, I'm looking for other animated masterpieces like this one, fresh original and entertaining."
"thekarmicnomad","8","7","7","14 February 2013"," I liked it more than the kids
","This is a great movie.<br/><br/>For someone who grew up with computer games from their conception, I found lots of little nuggets in here to make me smile.<br/><br/>The story is surprisingly sophisticated for a cartoon and the characters are quite fleshed out considering its target audience.<br/><br/>I saw this at the pictures and I was glued. The child we took to see it (and some others in the cinema) didn't seem as gripped.<br/><br/>I would have liked it if they had visited a few more games.<br/><br/>I would recommend this, especially if you like computer games and want something you can enjoy as well as the kids."

","Hey, wait a minute there! How come no one has had the idea of bringing the fantasy universe of video games into the big screen? I do not remember anyone having done this before ... ah ... except, of course, by TRON. Coincidence or not, also produced by Disney. Many people do not know, but Disney was a pioneer in computer graphics in the film industry. And now, under the general direction of John Lasseter (Pixar former), Disney keeps the tradition on creating some of the most magical moments in animated films or even in films regarded as traditional. ""Tron Legacy"" was an example of this latest kind. Perhaps a misunderstood work , is one of those unforgettable movies , in every aspect, especially for those who like CG, games, great music, a dazzling visual and an engaging story. Another recent product, this time already connecting x Disney Pixar was ""John Carter."" Directed by excellent Andrew Stanton , this film was also misunderstood by the general public. Unfortunately, it was poorly worked by Disney marketing people and the general public did not understand the overall proposal. Well .. Now we have ""Wreck-it Ralph."" I must confess ... I cried while watching this movie. That's right! So even as I cried in ""Up!"" or ""Wall-e"". These works come from different teams, but all have the same background: poetry. The look of this film is stunning. Colors, details, the overall creativity... are all very touching. The references to the world of video games are priceless! And what about that cute little girl? Well, I would like to summarize this movie as ""magic"". It belongs to that realm of fantasy and delight of magic, that kind of magic that makes you leave the theater with a light spirit, and happy and relaxed. A bit like Toy Story 3, ""Wreck-it Ralph"" is about the recognition of each individual's position in the universe and, of course, about friendship. I recommend this movie. At least for those who still insist on dreaming on and on."
"bdgill12","9","6","6","5 November 2012"," Perfect Mix of Disney and Pixar
","In 2006, when Disney bought Pixar and put John Lasseter in charge of its entire animation division, most of us expected great things. After 60- odd years of complete domination in the animated movie world, Disney had lost the magic, if you will, of Sleeping Beauty and The Lion King in the midst of a heap of mediocre features that just didn't measure up to the legacy the studio had created for itself. With Lasseter on board, though, multiple generations of Disney fans who had grown up on the virtues of Robin Hood and the like hoped that the man who had redefined the genre with Pixar would return the studio to its previous glory. In essence, we were hoping for Wreck-It Ralph.<br/><br/>All Ralph (John C. Reilly) wants in life is to be appreciated. As the villain in an 80s arcade game known as ""Fix it Felix Jr."", Ralph's job (which he does quite well) is to inflict damage upon the Niceland apartment building so that Felix (Jack McBrayer) can fix the damage. For thirty years, the end of each night, when the arcade the game resides in closes up shop, sees Felix returning to the thankful residents of Niceland while Ralph is relegated to the dump. Eager for a change, Ralph sets off into the various realms of the other games in the arcade in search of a Hero's Medal which would, he believes, change his lot back home. But when he stumbled into the racing game ""Sugar Rush"", he is waylaid by an obnoxious misfit known as The Glitch (Sarah Silverman), and when their paths become tied through a series of wild events, Ralph begrudgingly agrees to assist The Glitch, though he has no idea what he's getting himself into.<br/><br/>I have seen Wreck-It Ralph described as, ""Toy Story for video games"" and I believe that statement rings absolutely true. In a year in which Pixar's own feature (Brave) felt much more like a Disney movie than one that fit the standard Pixar model, it is fitting that the Disney film should have a decisive Pixarian feel to it. From the early moments, which include a gloriously scripted voice-over that would make Morgan Freeman jealous, Wreck-It Ralph establishes a link to the best of the Pixar universe and it never looks back. The concept itself is ingenious and deliciously outside the box, a truly original idea that opens up a thousand doorways through which to take the film. I imagine that, when advance notice of Wreck-It Ralph began circulating in Hollywood, many studio executives spent some time banging their respective heads against a wall or two, wondering why they didn't think of this. And yet the core value at the film's heart, the universal desire for acceptance, is incredibly simple and stands out as one of the reasons why the film excels. One of the keys to success in the Pixar universe is emotional relevance; they take common themes, struggles, and desires and illustrate them through lavish and meticulously crafted mediums, be they talking toys or a lonely robot. That quality courses through the veins of Wreck-It Ralph, creating a bond between the audience and a giant, buffoonish video game character, and making his journey seem all the more real in spite of the fact that it takes place within the code of an arcade game.<br/><br/>The quality of Wreck-It Ralph, however, goes far beyond the original concept, something I was concerned about going in. It would have been easy for director Rich Moore and his creative team to focus too much on the overlying idea and forget to build the rest of the film up to the appropriate standard. Instead, it is clear that every detail of Wreck-It Ralph was given the proper attention. For one thing, it is a very intelligent film. Sure, you have the requisite ""duty"" jokes that will keep the kids (and possibly the adults sitting next to me who shall remain nameless) laughing but overall, many of the bits are geared toward an adult audience (though none of it crossed the line to become inappropriate for younger viewers, a quality I appreciated). There are also a ton of little details (you might even consider them Easter Eggs of a sort) that are geared specifically to the gaming population, all of which brought great approval from the audience. The voice work, too, is spectacular. Reilly is the perfect actor to bring Ralph to life and he brings a real sharpness to his role. In addition, Silverman, McBrayer, Jane Lynch, and Alan Tudyk do an excellent job in their respective roles and all of them blend together with their characters. This is a quality I greatly appreciate as I feel that too many animated films utilize their voice actors only to create familiarity with the audience instead of having them actually act. As in, ""Hey! That's Adam Sandler talking! Now I like this movie!"" I find this very distracting and annoying. Here, though, the actors lend both their voices and their talents to the cast and I think Wreck-It Ralph is much the better for this. I was especially impressed by Tudyk, whose voice was completely unrecognizable to me until the final credits rolled. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most impressive feat Wreck-It Ralph pulls off comes in the form of keeping its narrative integrity and momentum together despite undergoing a fairly significant scene shift. Ralph's stay in ""Sugar Rush"" takes up a solid half (or more) of the film and that world is dramatically different from the film's initial setup. I was a bit concerned that this would result in a drop-off in interest/quality but instead the film just keeps on rolling. Wreck-It Ralph is a wonderfully fun, smart film that should keep a wide-ranging audience happy and instantly takes up residence amongst my favorite Disney films of all- time. <br/><br/>Please check out my other reviews at thesoapboxoffice.com"
"MovieLoverHannah","10","6","6","3 November 2012"," I thought this was going to be good... but WOW
","To say that ""Wreck-it-Ralph"" is excellent is an understatement.<br/><br/>This movie is fantastic. It perfectly combines comedy with drama and heart. The comedy comes from the many candy and game references that appeared in the dialogue and scenery. The drama comes from the twists in the plot. And the heart comes from the characters of Ralph and Vanellope.<br/><br/>Adults will reminisce in memories of arcade games, and children will be entranced with this film. Both will love it.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is a must-see for all ages. (In the theater, I probably saw more adults than children)"

","OK OK I get it.<br/><br/>This may not be the overall ""best"" animated film of all time but, now that I have seen it six or seven times, I think it is not only ONE OF THE BEST but also it excels at the following: <br/><br/>* best use of video games as a metaphor for an action story.<br/><br/>* best atmosphere -- just when you think you are comfortable with the interior of one game, they introduce another. It is like a 3D film without the actual need for the glasses.<br/><br/>* best matchup of voice actor and personality -- every animated film, now, in the past, and yet to come, strives for this. Many die-hard fans will say that Ellen Degeneres as a fish nailed it. Well, I don't think so. The voice acting of Sarah Silverman matched with the animated character (which I swear seems to be just Sarah herself when she was maybe 5 or 6 years old) is the most perfect meshing of the two I have seen.<br/><br/>The story, the acting, the direction, all perfect -- this is an amazing movie that really did not get the attention it deserved."

","Disney animation has been trying to capture the magic of Pixar movies for a while now. They normally produce quality pictures, but more often than not Pixar films are on a higher level than the computer animated Disney films. Even though Pixar is owned by Disney there is still the attempt to create non-Pixar computer animation that will be able to stand out for the entertainment monster that Disney is.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is the story of Ralph (John C. Reilly), the villain of an arcade game called ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" which it is clear draws influence from the original ""Donkey Kong"" game. Villains are never appreciated for being evil. The main point of most games is simply to take down the villain. How can one feel appreciated when everyone else only wants to beat them back? Ralph leaves his own game in an attempt to become a hero in the arcade. After earning a medal in a futuristic war game, ""Hero's Duty"", Ralph jumps to a candy themed racing game, ""Sugar Rush"". While in the game Ralph meets Vanellope (Sarah Silverman), a young girl whose only dream is to become a racer, but every other racer in the kingdom considers her a mistake. Even King Candy (Alan Tudyk) refuses to let a glitch race in the game. Fix-It Felix Jr. (Jack MacBrayer) and Calhoun (Jane Lynch) travel into the colorful racing world in search of Ralph and a rogue bug from Calhoun's game, ""Hero's Duty"". The story that develops involves an unlikely friendship, a sinister plot and a villain realizing what it truly means to be a hero.<br/><br/>A well thought out and well scripted story provide the back bone to this movie, video game references and cameos adds meat to the body and with great casting choices to wrap the characters up with fitting voices the movie becomes its own stand-alone entity. There are a few moments in which the script resorts to crude jokes and toilet humor, but the dialogue works with the characters to provide a humorous and entertaining movie. Continuity is one thing that is very easy to keep within a movie as long as the script is edited and thought through. There are a few minor inconsistencies in this movie and a few scenes left unexplained, but these minor inconsistencies do not make the movie confusing or difficult to follow.<br/><br/>Typically I prefer Pixar films over the Disney computer animation, however this year between Brave and Wreck-It Ralph I prefer the Disney computer animation."
"3xHCCH","7","5","5","17 December 2012"," ""Monsters Inc."" Set In a Video Game World
","I did not really plan to watch ""Wreck It Ralph"" at all because I do not really like the recent Disney output. I am unfamiliar with the characters and the title and poster did not look attractive to me. However, with consistently good word-of-mouth reviews, I felt I had to give it a shot. And yes, ""Wreck It Ralph"" deserves its good reputation, and I am glad I got to see it.<br/><br/>""Wreck It Ralph"" is the brutish gorilla-of-a-man villain of a arcade video game called ""Fix It Felix"". After thirty years of being thrown off the side of the building, Ralph feels he wanted to be the hero for a change. So he ventures outside his game to neighboring combat game ""Hero's Duty"" to earn his very own medal (as he sees Felix get a medal after each game). <br/><br/>When he does get his medal, Ralph accidentally triggers a virus which attacks him and brings him into the Technicolor world of the racing game ""Sugar Rush"". There he meets the cute little glitch Vanellope who earnestly wants to join and win a race, but is not allowed to because of her imperfections. Can Ralph help Vanellope achieve her dream, save his video arcade world from viral destruction and be a real hero?<br/><br/>While everything in ""Wreck It Ralph"" seemed new and original, I could not help but feel the spirit of ""Monsters Inc."" all throughout the film. It had the same basic story of a lonely but despised ""bad"" guy who does good and becomes a hero for a change. Even the interconnected world behind the video arcade (where all the characters had a life after the arcade closes for the night) is reminiscent of the labyrinthine world behind the closet doors in ""Monsters Inc."" <br/><br/>Overall though, ""Wreck It Ralph"" remains to be fun and happy, with just the right dose of drama and action here and there to entertain viewers of all ages. The artwork of the characters and the settings is very colorful and visually arresting. This is definitely a contender for best animated feature film of the year."
"valen060","10","5","5","8 December 2012"," Full-Blown Video Game Nostalgia!
","When I first heard of this movie at a few film conventions/expos, it piqued my interest. When I did, I was dazzled and drooling in 80s/90s video game nostalgia when I saw several familiar video game characters of different companies cameo in of all places a Disney animated feature! Sonic, Paperboy, and even a few Street Fighter characters (I could go on forever about those...)<br/><br/>The plot happened to be both intriguing and worth pondering over a few times. Why? Because the idea of an 80s video game ""bad guy"" called Ralph trying to redeem himself as a ""good"" guy sounds familiar from previous animated films. I mean, he can cross into any game he wants within a local arcade, trying to find a new perspective in life. Feels like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (the theme of different franchises crossing together and a somewhat similar subplot) meets ""Toy Story"" (characters that have a 'job' to amuse kids and are independent when no one is around).<br/><br/>Upon Ralph's meeting of a young girl called Vanellope Von Schweetz in a kart-racing game titled 'Sugar Rush,' it brought out the true emotional tone of the entire film, in my opinion. The pint-sized, 9-year-old sure has a lot of spunk on being a great racer, but the 'brother-sister' relationship between her and Ralph seems to have developed into the big focus.<br/><br/>As a small boy back in those glory days of gaming, 8-bit/16-bit games were my favorite past time. Now as an adult, it felt like reliving childhood all over again. These days, video games seems to be more of a guy's thing since there aren't many female gamers (which is why the creation of 'Sugar Rush' was included in the film's premise to balance that). The handful of video game character cameos don't intervene or overshadow the movie's premise. Ralph may not tread millions of miles away from Shrek (as they are characters that are usually feared or resented by others, but deep down they are misunderstood figures that only want to be accepted well in society), but Ralph is a likable big guy that has empathy underneath his destructive nature."
"snakagawa808","10","5","5","10 November 2012"," Surprisingly well done!
","Let me start off by saying that I am an early college student, and I have grown up with the classic Disney movies like Aladdin and Lion King. Those were always enjoyable movies to watch, especially since they're like pieces of my childhood. Ever since then, Disney Animation Studios has been producing movies that can be considered ""forgettable"" and ""below-average"". However, after the purchase of Pixar, Disney has definitely been taking leaps and bounds in the right direction with the help of Pixar Animation Studios. Saying this, I really didn't know what to expect from ""Wreck-It Ralph"" since Pixar's name was non-existent in the movie's previews and ads. At first, I decided to steer clear from this movie...<br/><br/>About a week after the release, I thankfully heard a lot of positive reviews and recommendations to see the movie. So, ""hey, why not,"" I decided to see the regular 2D movie. Boy, was I in for such a surprise. I was absolutely blown away by the amount of creativity and originality that was included with this movie. Knowing only a little about the older arcade games, I was still able to have a connection with the movie and follow along with the storyline really well. Speaking of the storyline, I was so amazed at how well the whole story unfolded, which included a great amount of twists and turns that constantly kept my mind active and engaged. However, being a kids' movie, I was also afraid of encountering those ""roll my eyes"" moments which are typically found in these types of movies. To my surprise again, NONE of those were found in ""Wreck-It Ralph""! The storyline was just so cleverly thought out and the plot progressed very well as the movie went on. The eye-pleasing quality of the different settings presented throughout (whether in the different arcade games, or inside the power strip) just shows the amount of imagination and creativity that was applied to the production of the movie. Also, the use of color and design elements was absolutely perfect. I really wish I could go back and see it in 3D now! The fact that both kids and adults can enjoy and share smiles to an animated movie like ""Wreck-It Ralph"" puts this movie on a high level, on which only several others have reached. I believe this is, soon to be, another Disney classic!<br/><br/>The only thing that I disliked about the movie was the inclusion of the Rihanna song. That was just a pretty awful song choice.<br/><br/>Other than that, *10/10 Highly Recommended!*"

","Disney's newest movie, Wreck-It Ralph, a 101 minute film directed by Rich Monroe is a real thrill ride that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. Movie attendees will watch John C. Reilly play the voice of protagonist Wreck-It Ralph, the bad guy in the arcade game ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" that just wants to be someone who is appreciated like the game's hero Felix. Also, Ralph goes through a lot of transformation, starting out as a bad guy just trying to be appreciated as a good guy and transforming into a genuinely caring, lovable nice guy. Another interesting part of the movie is the arcade that the movie is based in; it appeals to some of the older generation coming to watch the movie because of the childhood memories brought back by the arcade games they spent their time, and quarters, playing when they were younger. <br/><br/>Significantly, the movie begins with Ralph(John C. Reilly) shown doing his job of getting angry and smashing a building in Niceland, the name of the land in ""Fix-It Felix Jr."", followed by the loved hero of the game, Fix-It Felix Jr. himself, coming and rebuilding the smashed windows of the apartment building with his magical hammer. Felix fixes the building all the way to the top and the Nicelanders go to the roof, and after throwing Wreck-It Ralph off and into the mud, they give him a metal and praise him for his helpfulness. Day after day this happens making Ralph an even angrier bad guy, causing him to dream about him becoming a hero, winning a metal, and becoming appreciated. One day, Ralph sees, from his home in the dump, a 30th anniversary party going on in the penthouse of the apartment building he destroys daily. This was the final straw of Ralph's willingness to continue on with his job without being thanked the slightest bit, so he goes into the building to crash the party. Against the pleas from the Nicelanders, Felix awkwardly lets Ralph into the party, but being the over-sized clumsy bad guy he is, he smashes the beautiful intricate cake made for Felix. Ralph is downright embarrassed and leaves the game in search of a medal to be appreciated. <br/><br/>Additionally, Ralph changes a lot form the start to the finish of the movie. In the beginning, Ralph is an angry, misunderstood bad guy only interested in himself, but at the end he transforms to a kind, caring good guy that would sacrifice himself for others. Looking for a medal to in, Ralph finds the perfect opportunity in the game ""Hero's Duty,"" a first person shooter game where the objective is to kill evil ""cybugs,"" manages to wreak havoc in the game, but still win a metal. After winning the metal he takes an escape pod, loses control and crashes into a new game, ""Sugar Rush."" While in the process of crashing, he loses the metal to a young girl that he later learns is a glitch in the game. She uses the metal as a coin to enter a race but is banned from racing, due to her being a glitch. A deal is struck between Vanellope(Sarah Silverman), the girl, and Ralph in mutual benefit for both of them, Ralph gets a metal and Vanellope gets to race in the race. Ralph is reluctant and not very friendly with her, but over time grows more and more fond of her and even becoming best friends. By the end, Ralph completely changes from a bad guy to a loving kind good guy that would even be willing to sacrifice himself for others. <br/><br/>Essentially, many people would enjoy this movie, but some may avoid seeing it since it is a G-rated Disney movie. Some may think that the plot is childish and not worth it to pay for and see. Another example of people not wanting to see it may be that moviegoers might think that the arcade game setting would be nerdy and wouldn't understand it. Finally, people could just think that better movies are out and just watch it on Netflix when it comes out. <br/><br/>Moreover, another example of what makes this movie so great is the arcade setting. Many older people most likely remember playing the games portrayed in the movie that brought them entertainment and happiness. Games like PacMan, Donkey Kong, Tappers, a root beer bar tending game, and other games like Qbert and Final Fight. Although some of the people in the younger generation may not know what some of the old arcade games are, they were a great addition in the movie nevertheless. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is really exceptional, and may even be heartwarming to certain people. It excellently mixes action and a great story line. Disney produced a real winner with Wreck-It Ralph, and is definitely a must-see. Casting of the voices, plot, and animation are all good things about this movie, and is a great movie to see with your family. If you do choose to watch this excellent piece of cinematography, pay attention to the classic arcade games in the movie."
"koreanpanda7","9","4","4","2 January 2013"," Disney's new hero is a retro ""bad-guy""
","A large part of the movie's success was is due to its tribute to the classical video games, and how accurately it captured the essence of each type of video game while also making them original. Disney studio revisits the 8-bit graphics used in 1820s video games, such as Donkey Kong. The characters from retro games continue to move in the jerky 8-bit movement even when the animation switches back to the modern high definition graphics. The 80s avatars also speak in the particular language from that time period. Specifically, Felix frequently exclaims antiquated expressions like ""That's just the honey glow in my cheeks!"" Such minutia evokes a nostalgic feeling.<br/><br/>But the best parts of the movie were the romance between Felix and Calhoun, especially since the two had completely polar personalities, and the credits. Felix falls for Calhoun at first sight and continues to woo her with his classic pick-up lines. Calhoun attempts to brush off his courtship with her crude, sarcastic comebacks, which will definitely remind Glee-fans of Sue Sylvester. During the credits, Owl City's When Can I See You Again plays as the four main characters, Ralph, Vanellope, Felix, and Calhoun game hop through most games in the arcade and interact with game characters who had little to no parts in the actual movie. Their images changes in each game as they adapt to each game. ""Wreck It Ralph"" also had an awesome soundtrack that suited each scene so well that you'd think each song was made with the sole purpose to be played in this movie. The soundtrack of ""Wreck It Ralph,"" mostly composed by Henry Jackman, also features artists such as Rihanna and AKB48, a popular Japanese girl band.<br/><br/>One of the few complaints is the lack of racial diversity within the human characters. Most of the video game characters were Caucasian as well, but even more so in the real world. There are only a few human characters in the film, but the majority of them are white. There was also no need for the movie to be in 3D, especially since there were not many notable pop-ups utilizing the 3 dimensional effect. The 3D glasses only made the screen darker and harder to see than it already was."

","""Wreck-It Ralph is the not just a movie about arcade games but also about the relationship between people left on the outside"" Wreck-It Ralph is the bad guy from ""Fix It Felix Jr."" but it the words of his fellow bad guys he still has some good qualities that make him a good guy. When Ralph (John C. Reilly) is told by his fellow game workers to stay away he ventures out to other games or going Turbo so he can get respect that he was not able to get in his game. He first goes to Hero's Duty where he runs into Calhoun (Jane Lynch) and then causes some trouble in the game which then leads him to Sugar rush where he meets fellow outcast Vanllope (Sarah Silverman). The film then is about these two outcasts working together to try and get more respected they are.<br/><br/>If you were a person as a young kid who played many of the games explored in the film you would get some of references that they make to these games and others in the film. Ralph starts the movie doing his normal job but when the game celebrates it's 30th Anniversary he is unwanted and to try be respected he makes his way to Hero's Duty to try get the gold medal he thinks will get the people of his game to like him more. This movie does a great job of making these simple games more explored which leads to some great animation including the high definition from Hero's Duty to the sweet and colourful design that is Sugar Rush.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly voices Ralph and his voice-over performance fits the character so well I almost forgot it was him playing the character because between his noises and sounds he is very believable as Ralph. Sarah Silverman voices Vanllope and she provides a comedic relief to the film but stealing it from Reilly with her quick comebacks as well as just cute reactions to things that happen around her. Jan Lynch and Jack McBrayer voice Felix and Colhoun respectfully. Their voice overs seem fitted to roles they always seem to play but they are great together and the relationship that develops is almost as sweet as the two main characters.<br/><br/>The animation in this film is just some of the best I've seen this year and especially in the character design. Vanllope is designed as a cute little girl but she has glitch that makes her ruff giving her more of an edge. The story is very creative to take some of these characters that most people would know as figures on screens and making them more fleshed out and a treat to watch react with each other on the screen.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: B+ (MVP: Sarah Silverman)"

"dimensional_powerx","Null","4","4","6 November 2012"," The Nicest of all the surprises
","I simply don't trust Disney,,, is hard, very bad movies have clouded the reputation of this empire (a hate Bolt, Chicken Little, Open Range... and wasn't very convinced about Tangled, Princess and the frog)... but There is a simple key that is changing everything: John Lasetter,,,the man is a genius,,, he knows how to take a very simple story, and turn it in something memorable (Meet the Robinsons may be not a perfect movie,,, but the last 20 minutes are brilliant)... After seeing the trailers I was very skeptical: I love videogames, but the story didn't quite convinced me,,, so, I came to the theater, bought my ticket (half price in 3-D... super!!!!)and prepared to see, ready to be disappointed or enjoy a good movie.... <br/><br/>And what happen? I watched one of the very best movies this year (not a great year I must say, but not very bad). The story, simple, ad the beginning, evolves into a very interesting mess that I'm sure no one expects (The 'Pixaresque' formula of ""one simple character could be what you wouldn't think"" persist), and is very enjoyable,,, the characters,,oh, my, the characters!!!! where do I start? the protagonist, Ralph is funny is easy to sympathize with him... I loved Vanellope; I must admit, the trailers made me dislike her, but she redeems pretty well, she is charismatic, behaves like a child, but gets angry,, then jumps full of happiness,,, one minute later is crying (that scene,,,the car scene,,, is one of the most shocking scenes in a ""child movie"",,, If I were 6-7 years old surely started crying with her),,, his background and development are vital part of the story and is delicious see her grow in the movie,,, Felix and Calhoun provide tension, humor and complexity to the scheme and make you smile a lot.... Short story: The characters are one of the best group in Disney movies....<br/><br/>And the games,,, the references,,, my good, from the old arcades, to the new shooters, the first half hour is full of them,,, big and small, direct and indirect,,, in the front and in the back,,, some direct and shocking (the one with Kano is simply outstanding,,, i say) some other more subtle but funny (Dig Dug), others are expected but satisfying (Sonic giving public messages,,,must have been Mario, but Nintendo was very hard to negotiate...pussies), some a little obscure (the exclamation mark!!! you really don't expect them), and some direct to the players (the Konami code!!!!!!!!, the Centipede and Asteroids arcades!!!!!)... Is also very remarkable that the movie doesn't rely on them,,, it sticks to his 3 fictional games(Fix-It Felix Jr, Hero's Duty and Sugar Rush) and make it from there without more cameos after 30-40 minutes,,, and that's good, it could have been very annoying to have characters jumping on and off the screen every 5 seconds,,,,<br/><br/>I loved this movie,,, because, is made simple with detail and (oh, the cheesy moment, but I don't care) is made with love for the job,,,, You can't miss it,,, ah, doesn't matter if 3-D or 2-D,,, doesn't change a lot,,,,"
"StevePulaski","10","8","10","4 November 2012"," ""My name is Ralph and I'm a bad guy""
","Perhaps the most unrealistic detail about Disney's Wreck-It Ralph is that it shows arcades as places that are buzzing with activity from tykes with quarters ready to be used as turns in a video game. Arcades are not a dying breed, but a dead breed, and the only ones that exist now exist in a niche marketing for only the collector and the nostalgic types.<br/><br/>However, I'm more than pleased with Disney's decision to introduce a younger generation to the wonders of video games mounted inside a large case, that accept quarters and in return deliver memorable action and invaluable fun. Wreck-It Ralph is among one of the brightest, most fun animated pictures I've ever seen, with look and intelligence seemingly coming from the five-letter animation studio that should remain unnamed (their main director has an ""executive producer"" credit here). Gift-wrapped in warm nostalgic vibes and beautiful whimsy, this is a picture that the kids can enjoy and the parents can enjoy, perhaps even more than their little ones. I, for one, can say I enjoyed this more than many of the rambunctious five-year-olds in my theater.<br/><br/>The film opens with our main character Ralph (voiced fittingly by John C. Reilly) narrating his life-story, as he spends his days inside an arcade game called Fix-It Felix, Jr. as the game's main villain. His full name, ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" defines his job; he is responsible for demolishing a highrise building so that ""Fix-It Felix, Jr."" (controlled by a person in the arcade) can rebuild it quickly using his magic hammer. If the player completes the challenge, amidst while Ralph is throwing things at Felix in the process, they will then see the people who live in the highrise toss Ralph off the roof in glee. Rinse and repeat.<br/><br/>This has been Ralph's daily routine since his first day in Litwak's Arcade. He states that he has seen many arcade machines come and go, but his old-fashioned game has gone on to be timeless along with other gems like Pac-Man. We realize that Ralph is stating his remorse and complaints to a group of other video games villains who are bad guys but ""not bad guys."" Get it? To see Dr. Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog, Clyde, the orange ghost from Pac-Man, and other villains from beloved games gather in one room, reiterating their problems like a band of depressed AA members is touching and one of the many wonderful things about one of Disney's best films.<br/><br/>When Ralph is not invited to the thirtieth anniversary of Fix-It Felix, Jr., he decides that is the last straw, and announces to his fellow game-members that he will abandon his duty as villain for the game to pursue other games where he will be more appreciated and, hopefully, earn a medal to show his skills and capabilities. He winds up winning a medal in a first-person shooter game called Hero's Duty, yet becomes lost in a kiddy racing game called Sugar Rush and loses his medal to a little girl named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman).<br/><br/>Vanellope is a glitched character, meaning she often has electronic ticks that render her as incomplete (glitches in real games usually result from a programming error). Her dream is to race with the other girls in Sugar Rush, only she is ostracized to being nothing more than a meaningless glitch. It dawns on Ralph that the only way he'll be able to get a medal is to help Vanellope win the next race and prepares her by getting her a go-kart, teaching her how to drive, and just being her faithful companion.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer) worries about the fate of his arcade game, which occupies the dreaded ""Out of Order"" sign on the screen since Ralph's departure, and teams up with Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun (Jane Lynch), the lead character in Hero's Duty, to find Ralph and save their arcade game.<br/><br/>What's wonderful is seeing this film come equipped with its limitless, never-ending supply of energy that many children's films tend to lack. With many different characters, personalities, and arcade worlds to explore, writers Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston never run out of material, and the dozens of animators behind this picture never seem to run out of ideas on how to bring these worlds to life. I also adore the way the Toy Story model is erected here, where things normally controlled by humans, take on a life of their own, with real problems, complications, and mischief when they are left to fend for themselves. Seeing these characters interact with each other, behind the monitors and machines in ""Game Central Station"" is nothing shy of ingenious and marvelously entertaining.<br/><br/>This is a film where colors, craft, characters, vision, creativity, worlds, look, voice-acting, etc shine over cartoon idiocy and redundant childishness. Wreck-It Ralph is one of Disney's strongest works in the company's history and quite possibly the closest any animation studio has come to approaching or one-upping that same five-letter studio I referred to earlier. It takes a simple, effective moral and places it as the backdrop to a story that is emotionally involved, superbly in touch, visually stunning, and fearlessly alive.<br/><br/>NOTE: As expected, the film begins with a seven minute short, titled Paperman, about a man who is immediately taken with a woman he meets for seconds while awaiting the arrival of the morning train, and how he spends his workday trying to get her attention. Without giving anything away, just like the film that succeeds it, it is one of the best, most enjoyable shorts in years. Four stars.<br/><br/>Voiced by: John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, and Jane Lynch. Directed by: Rich Moore."

Felix meets Sergeant Calhoun that tells him that the Cy-Bug would destroy any game and he immediately falls in love with her. Ralph helps Vanellope to build her own racing car and becomes her hero; but soon he is convinced by King Candy that Vanellope is just a glitch and she may destroy Sugar Race. Ralph destroys her car and her dreams expecting to protect Vanellope. But when he sees her picture on the cabinet of Sugar Race, he learns that something is wrong in the explanation of King Candy.<br/><br/>""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a delightful animation by the Walt Disney studios with the story of the sweetest arcade villain I have ever seen. The clumsy Ralph and his existential crisis are hilarious and the animation is a great tribute to the fans of the early video games arcade. Despite my age, I am a fan of animations and ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is another entertaining release by Disney, with a beautiful message of friendship. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Detona Ralph"" (""Detonate Ralph"")"
"avsroxbronxfan","10","11","15","2 November 2012"," Funniest Disney film ever
","When I first watched trailers for this movie, I was completely surprised that Disney was making something like this. I personally thought this would be something Pixar would make instead. I also wondered how much money Disney would have to give video game companies like Nintendo to use Bowser in their film. I thought I would like it, but it wouldn't crack my top 10 Disney films. I was wrong. I went to see this movie, and I was blown away. This film taught a very good lesson: To be yourself, and to think of others. Ralph is a villain in an arcade game, and he wants to be a good guy, and respected by others, thus starting his journey through other games trying to earn a medal to do so. At the end (spoilers here) he actually remains the villain, but people respect him more, since he helped a little girl in a racing game rise again to glory. He stays as a villain, but isn't treated like the garbage he once lived in since he showed he can be a hero, and a nice guy. He learns to be himself, and people will respect him. The others realized it, and learned from their mistake. That is powerful. But the thing I like most about the film is the comedy. I've seen funny Disney films, like Aladdin, Great Mouse Detective, and The Emperor's New Groove, but when it comes to comedy, this film takes the cake. ""You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?"" *Ralph takes off the King's glasses and hits him with them* You hit me with glasses. Well played."" Hilarious. The people in the theater were constantly laughing throughout the entire film, as was I. Personally, my only problem with the film is one thing with the villain. Not the villain as a whole, just one part. He's the king of a racing game, and he deletes the file and memory of Penelope, the ACTUAL ruler of the place, so he can be king and she wouldn't interfere. That part is genius, but here's one thing I don't like about him. Apparently, he was actually a virus in another racing game, but they don't explain that until the end of the film. They don't explain that he deleted her file and memory until the end too. You only know that for about 10 minutes of the film (or something like that) until the king is defeated, so this was really forced. However, it is actually a good cause, because one thing I like about the villain is how subtle he is. There's one part (you don't know the king deleted her file yet) where he explains to Ralph why she can't race, and the fact that she is now a glitch makes her unavailable to leave that game, and if someone played it, they would think the game is busted, thus the plug gets pulled and she would die. He makes you feel that he's actually a good guy, and cares for her. I like that a lot. Anyway, outside of my one problem with the villain, this film was excellent. One of the best of the year, and I plan on seeing it again."
"nick-laslett","10","12","17","2 November 2012"," Better than Toy Story!
","Disney with John Lasseter's guidance have finally equalled Pixar's masterpiece Toy Story!<br/><br/>Take the central conceit of the inner life of toys and transfer it to the arcades. Toy Story may be the originator of this idea, but Wreck It Ralph is able to dig deeper and push it further, with a classic children's tale of archetypes and life affirming messages. <br/><br/>The arcade characters have a back story and character arc that allows Disney to pile on the layers of meaning and depth. Like the Toy Story trilogy this is about much more than just a Hero's journey, with the same interest in a subtext of philosophy and the meaning of happiness.<br/><br/>Also just like the fictional toys in Toy Story, Disney have much fun in creating three perfect video games from different eras, that are just so good you can't believe they don't already exist. The game worlds Fixit Felix Jr and Sugar Rush are the equivalent to Woody's and Buzz's respective universes. Two very different worlds and philosophies driving much of the story. Ralph is even presented with a morale dilemma all the equal of Woody's choice in Toy Story 2. Which is resolved with typical inventiveness. <br/><br/>It perhaps lacks the universal appeal as people are still a little prejudice towards videogames. They were preaching to the converted with this viewer, I can only hope that this film is a step in the right direction in improving the acceptance of a valid entertainment medium. It is certainly not just all about shooting things! <br/><br/>Hopefully Wreck-It Ralph will entertain you too and maybe we'll get an equally well thought out sequel featuring the nasty game collector that wants to lock the game cabinet away in a museum so no one can play it. Just a thought."

You've seen the trailers, he's supposed to wreck stuff and only do that, but he wants more than that.<br/><br/>I won't give you any spoilers, I will just say the screening we saw had kids of all ages in it from toddlers to teens, and parents, grandparents and some adults without kids with them at all.<br/><br/>John C Reilly is great, Sarah Silverman (who I don't generally like in live action stuff), is brilliant, and the voice talents chosen were spot on.<br/><br/>It's not Pixar, but it's the best animated original story Disney has produced in years - take your family, you'll have fun! <br/><br/>*** One note *** The Wii game of the same name is NOT good - it does NOT follow the movie plot and it's just a bad game."
"hellraiser7","10","7","9","3 November 2012"," Game Master
","I've been a gamer ever since I was six years old and I still am to this day, I've been there from the video arcades to the console gaming we have now so yeah that's how far my video gaming experience and love for the genre has gone. This film is a dream come true, it's one of those movies I feel were just made for me, I'm glad that finally someone had the guts utilize this idea because like any great video game it actually works.<br/><br/>There is just so much I love about this movie it's both a fun and touching underdog story but also a love letter to video games. The animation is just top notch, I just love the character designs from the video game characters were familiar and had cameos like Q-Bert, Pac-Man, Ryu, Ken, you name it. Down to the character focused on my favorite design is Vanellope because she so darn cute. But what impresses me more are the background designs, like the arcade itself and the arcade cabinets animated, for the record most of the video games cabinets seen are actual video games. And the video game worlds were great my favorite one was the Suger Rush world, the game was a mix of both ""Mario Kart"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". <br/><br/>I simply love the concept that the world of video games is real and that each of the video games are businesses where they work. The humor is great both visual and verbal. There are just so many jokes, homage jokes, and in jokes on some of the clich√©s and elements in video games, it would probably take more than one watch to catch most to all of them, but there there. From big jokes like the fact there is some sort of group therapy session for bad guys, Oreo Cookie guards, to even tiny jokes like how some of the characters in Ralph's world move which is a little stiff it makes sense since most old games were restricted to certain movements as contrasted with the games we have now where we have more freedom of movement. <br/><br/>Even though the film and the characters aren't so serious you do care about them. From supporting characters like Felix (Jack McBrayer) whom is a Mario like protagonist that is unsmooth. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) is a ""Gear of War"" like heroine that despite being tough as nails is a softy at heart. I just love how much spit fire she has though another thing that's funny about her is her tragic back story. This is funny because it's true, it's a common clich√© with a lot of our current video game heroes and heroines because by it's nature it's a motive device to give them a reason to do what they do. I like the back and forth between them both are sort of a conflicting and correlating dynamic where Felix is the representation of old school gaming and Calhoun new school. Even like the romance between them which is strange (well not that strange if you think of Mario and Princess Peach) but sweet.<br/><br/>Ralph (John C Really) is great, he's a gentle blue collar giant who really isn't a bad guy that's just simply his job, but is really a good guy. He's sympathetic because he's an underdog that really gets no respect or even credit for doing his job. This guy has a dream of just having more in his life or at least for life to get better. My favorite line from Ralph is, ""When did video games become so violent and scary?"" I always cracked up because it's really not a bad question.<br/><br/>But my favorite character though is Vanellope, from the fact she's voiced by one of my favorite comedians Sarah Silverman but I just love her character because she funny as hell. She just has loads of hyper energy makes sense since she lives in a world of candy, has some of the best darn lines, but also just like Ralph her character is an underdog which makes her sympathetic because she's a person with a dream of just wanting to do what she loves racing but is just always getting crap canned because of the fact she glitches, but trust me that glitch is a gift in disguise. I like the back and forth dynamic with Ralph and her, it's pretty much like a buddy buddy comedy.<br/><br/>If the film has a message it's about being more than what you are and to not let labels define you.<br/><br/>Wreck it Ralph scores.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

It was interesting experience.<br/><br/>The storyline didn't seem cluttered or overly long, which was good, you won't get bored with the film quickly (unless you watch it three times a day). While watching the film though, I wondered if the writers had drawn inspiration from an earlier Disney work, ""Tron""? I really enjoyed how the arcade games were incorporated into a film released during an age of Mobile Gaming as well, nostalgic for those of us who grew up with arcades. Also, I thought it interesting how the characters from the game used the surge protector as a subway system, that was ingenious thinking.<br/><br/>I have also heard rumors of a sequel to this film already, based on platform gaming.

","Wreck it Ralph is on another level! It is so refreshing to see a film that is based on videogames to be actually not just good but amazing for once and really capture the feel of retro games. The script is full of heart and humour but also has a bit of drama and pathos but of course being a Disney movie everything is alright in the end. Wreck it Ralph uses ideas and concepts of other animated films, if you put Toy Story, Monsters Inc and Who Framed Roger Rabbit in a blender you would get Ralph's unique video game hopping story. The film is full of references to retro games but it won't put of casual viewers or even non-gamers (like my mum) from the story which focuses on Ralphs search for a medal and the colourful characters and captivating worlds he visits on the way however it is worth seeing the film a second time around to try to spot famous video game characters in the background. There is also a funny mention about modern games ""since when did video games become so violent and scary"" a legitimate question. Overall Wreck it Ralph is also the best Disney film (although the unique story and characters feel a lot like a Pixar film) and has a brilliant message for kids which is a about acceptance and changing your outlook on life."
"nrbarton","8","3","3","28 February 2013"," 'Wreck it Ralph' is almost as good as Pixar's finest
","'Wreck It Ralph' looks and sounds very much like a Pixar movie from the synopsis and trailer, with similar themes to 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters Inc', but set in a video game arcade world. This sets hopes very high indeed, so the obvious question is 'Does it live up to such high standards?' The short answer is 'almost'.<br/><br/>The movie began with a short film called 'Paperman' which was almost worth the entry price in itself. Do not, under any circumstances, be late and miss this short film. It was beautifully drawn in black and white and so sweet and romantic.<br/><br/>The premise for 'Wreck It Ralph' is the most genius since 'Monsters Inc'. In terms of concept and ideas, it could even be the smartest computer animated kids movie yet. I don't want to spoil it too much, but basically Ralph is the bad guy in a video game, and, as the bad guy, the other characters in the game treat him with disrespect. He decides he's had enough and wants to prove that he can be a good guy and win a medal. To do so, however, he has to travel to various other video games and this results in all sorts of mayhem and hilarity.<br/><br/>The majority of the film is spent in a brightly coloured candy racing game called 'Sugar Rush', where Ralph tries to help his new little friend 'Vanellope' win the race. This could be an issue for the ladish types who may be disappointed in spending so much time in such a girly game. For me though, I absolutely loved 'Sugar Rush'! Not just because it shares the same name as the smutty, teenage-lesbian drama I used to enjoy so much, but I also thought it looked like an amazing game and the racing near the end was such fun, especially in 3D.<br/><br/>'Wreck It Ralph' is one of those movies where it's actually worth going to see the 3D version because you can tell some thought and effort has gone into it. The environment of the Sugar Rush game reminded me of 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' with all the bright colours and food. The 3D wasn't as good as in that movie, but it was well worth the extra cost.<br/><br/>'Wreck it Ralph' is certainly amongst the better computer animated movies. It's very clever, witty and gets to you on an emotional level so you care about the characters. The reasons why it falls a few points short of the very best Pixar work and 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs', is that it's not quite as witty quite as often, even if there are a few truly hilarious parts. There is also a problem with product placement. Now I don't have an issue with video game based product placement in the movie as that fits the theme, but 'Nesquik-sand' and 'Oreos' singing 'Oreee-o, Oreee-ooo' is too far! This is brainwashing kids with advertising, and you may think I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but the Nestl√© corporation who make Nesquik are an ethically disgusting company who should be boycotted. It really did cheapen and taint the experience for me at times. I'm sure you don't get that in Pixar movies, and if you do I've never noticed.<br/><br/>The best Pixar movies just have that slight notch of class over 'Wreck It Ralph', but when not comparing it to the best there is, it's a wonderful film in its own right. I had an absolute blast, laughed a lot and even welled up with tears a couple of times. I was a bit self-conscious of taking my glasses off at the end in case a group of kids spotted the tears in my eyes and laughed at me. The thing is, they tears of happiness because the friendship between Ralph and Vanellope was so damn sweet. I adored 'Wreck It Ralph' and think people of all ages who have any interest in video games will feel a similar way about the movie."
"mattrogers14","8","3","3","2 February 2013"," Does not disappoint
","I am a huge Disney fan/video game fan so when Disney created a film based on the arcade I was excited about the film, and after watching it the hype did not disappoint.<br/><br/>The film, based on the life of a villain wanting to be a hero involves many characters recognisable to the gaming world as these tie in well with the story, along with many backgrounds to games such as the iconic Pacman platform. Within the candy world, the use of 'Nesquik Sand' and 'Diet Coke Springs' add that extra element of fun for the family.<br/><br/>The movie also includes a range of music that is suitable for the each member of the family in order to enjoy the film. Artists such as Rihanna, Owl City and even Skrillex have been carefully chosen to represent a specific part of the film and the songs used help to represent a certain game shown in the film.<br/><br/>The use of the graphical element and references to the advancement in gaming technology also give a pretty cool background to the film. The use of how old games connect and interact with the newer games show how the graphics have developed over time and all this makes the film great for all Disney and gaming lovers."

"caseymoviemania","10","3","3","8 December 2012"," Casey's Movie Mania: WRECK-IT RALPH (2012)
","In 1995, Pixar had creatively made a memorable story of how toy figures live their life in TOY STORY. Now following from the similar tradition, Walt Disney Animation Studios' WRECK-IT RALPH imagines how video game characters would come to life after an arcade closes its doors. No doubt it's a high-concept premise worth looking forward to. Special kudos to first-time feature director Rich Moore (best known for directing a few episodes of TV's Futurama and The Simpsons) for gamely exploring his nostalgic love of yesteryears as well as today's arcades generation (fans of video game are going to love this a lot) and brimming its heartwarming tale with a dash of knowing humor and genuine emotion. Not only that, WRECK-IT RALPH is one gorgeous-looking animation with an keen eye for detail, making this a fun-filled adventure for all ages.<br/><br/>""Fix-It Felix Jr."" is an old-fashioned, 8-bit arcade game in which handyman Felix (voice of Jack McBrayer) must continuously rebuild an apartment building (with his magical hammer) after it gets demolished by the gigantic 9-foot-tall and 600-plus-pound Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly). Once the arcade closes its doors, the characters in the video game clock out like a regular job and return to their own lives. For Felix and his fellow tenants, they always have great time hanging out together. But not for Ralph, who's been an outcast and villain for thirty years already. He lives in the brick pile next to Felix's apartments, and he has grown tired of being treated like a garbage.<br/><br/>One night, Ralph finds out that there's a 30th-anniversary party going on at Felix's apartments and he's not invited at all. He gradually learns the hard truth from Felix's fellow tenants that nobody in the apartment likes him. And so Ralph sets out to prove his worth by earning his own medal from somewhere else and hopes to overcome his programming as a bad guy.<br/><br/>Enter ""Hero's Duty"", which is a state-of-the-art, post-apocalyptic first-person shooter combat game. Ralph disguises as one of the soldiers and meets the tough Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch). Along the way, he manages to prove his bravery to win the game and eventually earns a medal. However, he accidentally steps onto an egg, which unleashes a bug that rapidly multiplies in no time. Apparently those bugs capable to destroy everything and if they are not stopped, the existence of the entire arcade could be wiped out forever.<br/><br/>But all hope is not lost, as Ralph is the only one who can saves the day. When he subsequently ends up in a colorful racing game called ""Sugar Rush"", he forces to team up with chirpy ""Sugar Rush"" outcast Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a ""glitch"" branded by King Candy (Alan Tudyk) who dreams of being a race car driver. They end up helping each other in a bid to win her first race, and at the same time, make things right before it's too late.<br/><br/>First things first. The graphic animation is truly a sight to behold, and every technical departments here are simply amazing. Adding to the zest, is Henry Jackman's dynamic score that often propels the movie into a high gear.<br/><br/>Then there's the remarkable, yet inspiring screenplay by Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee. Throughout the movie, you can see both screenwriters and director Rich Moore have certainly puts a lot of love expanding their idea to create a knockout inside world of arcade games. For instance, the characters in the arcade games are able to cross over into other games by way of transportation zooming through the electrical cords. And every access are linked together by a Game Central Station (obviously modeled after Grand Central Station), which serves as a main hub for the game characters. Apart from that, the screenwriters knows very well how to inject enough humor, sentiment and of course, captivating characters all around.<br/><br/>Speaking of captivating characters, WRECK-IT RALPH is certainly blessed with a wonderfully talented voice cast. Each of them deliver their characters with remarkable depth and pathos. As an anti-hero Ralph, John C. Reilly makes a likable hulk who may be a ""bad guy"" from other good-guy characters' point-of-view, but he's actually a heartfelt person especially when Vanellope reveals his true self. Sarah Silverman is both adorable and endearing as the little cute racer Vanellope who never gives up to achieve what she wants. I must say, both Reilly and Silverman made a terrific pair together. Jack McBrayer, in the meantime, is lovable as the wholesome Felix, while Jane Lynch gives a knockout performance as the no-nonsense Sergeant Calhoun. Last but not least is Alan Tudyk, who is simply spot-on playing a cunning role as King Candy.<br/><br/>Further praise goes to Walt Disney Pictures for managed to license a healthy number of recognizable game characters throughout the movie, which is especially fun for video gamers. There's Pac-Man and his orange-ghost nemesis, Clyde; M. Bison, Zangief, Ryu and Ken from the ""Street Fighter"" series; Sonic the Hedgehog, Q-Bert, Bowser from the ""Super Mario"" series (Mario himself is actually set to cameo as well, but the producer unable to fit him somehow) and even a blink-or-you-miss, cameo appearance from an infamous ""exclamation mark"" (you know it when you hear the familiar sound) from the ""Metal Gear Solid"" series.<br/><br/>WRECK-IT RALPH is a top-notch animation that Pixar could have added inside their roster, and certainly earns its reputation as one of the best and most entertaining animated features in a long while."
"toqtaqiya2","7","3","3","6 December 2012"," Wreck-It Ralph is a familiar story for children, but it's still a colorful adventure film.
","Wreck-It Ralph is a film for children though even adults will enjoy it because of its smart humor and clever references to the arcade. The story is simple, with Wreck-It Ralph representing adults with a mid-life crisis and Vanellope von Schweetz representing children outside of the pack. The film starts slow but it builds to a thrilling ending which can easily compel viewers to see it again. The influence of Japanese animation on the story and the animation is obvious. One of the songs on the soundtrack is Sugar Rush by the Japanese girl group AKB48. Another nice tune in the film is When Can I See You Again? by Owl City. An excellent voice cast was assembled to bring the likable characters to life, including John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch and Alan Tudyk. Wreck-It Ralph was produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and not by Pixar. It doesn't reach the level of excellence of Pixar's best releases but it's still better than Pixar's worst, and even Pixar's worst are quite good. In conclusion Wreck-It Ralph, by director Rich Moore, is a good piece of entertainment, however I have to mention that it doesn't make good use of 3D. It's the 52nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. I recommend seeing it."

Despite the glaring flaw of the Candy King entering an original Sonic cheat code onto a NES controller when it should of been on a Mega Drive controller this is easily a perfect animated movie.<br/><br/>Everybody from Pac-Man to 'Sa-teen' gets a look in here. Oh and who could forget the 'Surge Protector'!? Everything in this movie is so well thought out and the video game twists are genius. The animation is also flawless, although I only saw this in 2D.

"Jangobadass","9","3","3","11 November 2012"," Best. Video Game Movie. Ever!
","From beginning to end, I was most entertained by this movie. Seriously, seeing the Disney Animation Studio logo done 8-bit style with the Steamboat Willie theme in ""bleep-bloop"" sounds let me know it was going to an interesting evening.<br/><br/>The world of Wreck-It Ralph is fun and imaginative as such a place would be, with video game characters of every occupation and species mingle when their games aren't being played. There are real video game characters (though some are more recognizable than others) mixed with original ones. There are cameos from Q-Bert, Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac Man, the heroes of Street Fighter and more, as well numerous subtle references to video game lore.<br/><br/>The title character is the giant villain from ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" (which bears several resemblances to the original arcade version of Donkey Kong). Thing is, Ralph is tired of being the bad guy after thirty years and countless defeats of being thrown into a puddle of mud from the top of a high-rise apartment building and going home alone to the dump at the end of day while Felix gets praise, medals, and pies. Now he wants some respect and better treatment. One night things get out of hand and Ralph sets out to earn a medal of earn the respect of Felix and the Nicelanders. He finds his chance when he learns of a first person shooter called ""Hero's Duty"" but ends up biting off more than he can chew. He then accidentally arrives in ""Sugar Rush"", a parody of cutesy kart racing games where the characters aren't quite as sweet as their candy themed world would make you think.<br/><br/>Aside from its fantastical world and settings, the movie greatly benefits from some stellar voice work. John C. Reily makes Ralph sympathetic and likable, but with a temper that gets him in trouble. Jack McBrayer plays Felix as an amiable, if not misguided, do-gooder who often talks like a character from the Andy Griffith Show. Jane Lynch is a hoot as Heros' Duty heroine Sgt. Calhoun, a send up of nonsense, tough as nails video game protagonists (complete a tragic backstory that's kind of funny in how over the top it is). Alan Tudyk channels the spirit & voice of late comic actor Ed Wynn in his performance as King Candy, Sugar Rush's seemingly goofy (but scheming) ruler.<br/><br/>The weak link is Sarah Silverman as Vanellope Von Schweetz. The character herself is intentionally annoying, at least in her early scenes, but her storyline is actually quite touching. She just wants to race with the other Sugar Rush characters, but is ostracized and bullied for being a glitch. Fate forces her and Ralph to work together, and watching them bond is kind of stirring. But Silverman make the character more annoying than she needs to be.<br/><br/>Also, the story kinda loses steam in the third act thanks to staying in one place for too long. As well a certain plot twist near the end. To be fair, there is some foreshadowing and hints, but there's a fine line between ""Didn't see that one coming!"" and ""Wait, what?"" and this twist (and a later one tied to it) come dangerously close.<br/><br/>With its multiple settings in an innovative & imaginative world, colorful (both ways) cast of characters, and plethora of video game references, this is a fun movie for gamers and casual moviegoers alike."
"thenthbluestar","10","3","3","11 November 2012"," It's an Enjoyable Film
","It follows the Disney formula for a good, heart-felt movie, and while one could criticize the use of such a formula, one is likely to be too busy falling in love with the characters and getting misty-eyed as those characters face the issues they face if one would simply sit and watch the film. Even without being fully familiar with video-game culture and all the references and cameos that the film displays abundantly, any movie-goer will likely find themselves enthralled with the animation, character design, plot development, and genuine issues that each character faces. Undoubtedly, by the end, you will be cheering with moistened cheeks. This movie is a must-see!"

"the_grand_lebowski","7","3","3","4 November 2012"," Wreck-It Ralph: A Villain's Destructive Path to Heroism
","It isn't easy being the bad guy, especially when you are the villain in a video game forced to repeat your destructive tendencies on a daily basis. The title character of Wreck-It Ralph faces this particular dilemma. Ralph is tired of being the ""bad guy"" in the game: Fix-It Felix Jr. Ralph's role puts him at odds with his adversary, Felix Jr., who garners all the praise and adoration from the townspeople after he fixes Ralph's destruction. Ralph's jealousy of Felix comes to a head on the thirtieth anniversary party for Fix-It Felix Jr. Upon being shunned from the party, Ralph decides that the only obstacle keeping him from achieving the rank of hero is a golden medal. Determined to win the respect of his fellow game characters, Ralph sets out to accomplish something that is forbidden in the arcade world: stealing an item from another game.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph beautifully combines animation that audiences have come to love with a nostalgic look at the wonders of the arcade world. In a time when arcades are rapidly waning in popularity, Ralph revitalizes characters from classic games, and introduces unique new characters into the Disney pantheon. Pac-Man, Q*bert, Sonic the Hedgehog, Bowser, and numerous other characters from arcade classics have cameos in this movie. Whether you are a hardcore video game aficionado, or someone who has spent little-to-zero time in an arcade, Wreck-It Ralph is a film that you are sure to enjoy. <br/><br/>Disney sans Pixar has had some difficulty creating films that entice both children and parents. After a long string of pandering sequels, and weak features, Disney Animation Studios appears to have their formula down. 2010's Tangled was a welcomed surprise, and Wreck-It Ralph is equally enjoyable. Director Rich Moore does an excellent job blending a morality play into the video game world. Screenwriters Phil Johnston (Cedar Rapids) and Jennifer Lee compose a script that is packed with references to video games, candy, and classic cinema. One of the funniest segments in the film involves Ralph attending ""Bad-anon"", a support group for video game villains (think AA, but with a Pac-Man ghost and Zangief from Street Fighter). When Ralph enters the game ""Sugar Rush"", Johnston and Lee inundate the dialogue with references to candy and sweets, which grows stale as time progresses, but carries a sugary taste in the beginning. The talents of the director and writers are on full capacity during the majority of this feature.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch, Sarah Silverman, and Alan Tudyk all lend their voice talents to this production. John C. Reilly (Ralph) continues to be one of my favorite actors, voicing Ralph so fluidly that one can't help but think this role was written precisely for him. Jack McBrayer is lovable as always, playing an overeager Felix, whose charm lies in his quirky euphemisms and doe-eyed stares. Felix, swooning for Jane Lynch's Calhoun, delivers one of the greatest lines in the movie: ""Oh, that's not from blunt force trauma ma'am. That's just the honey glow in my cheeks."" Sarah Silverman (Vanellope) plays a character ostracized in her game due to being a ""glitch"". She is the annoying sidekick who demeans Ralph constantly, but still manages to earn his adoration. The role was developed with Silverman in mind, and her raspy voice compliments her character's brashness perfectly. Alan Tudyk plays one of the most divisive roles in the film. His character, King Candy, is a bubbling buffoon, who has dark motives, and an inexplicable drive to see Ralph and Vanellope fail. Moore himself supplies the voices of a number of characters in the film‚Äîhis turn as Sour Bill is delightfully droll. <br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is currently the highest-grossing film of the weekend, and is sure to remain among the top features of this season because of its dynamic appeal and heartening story. Although the second portion of the film seems hustled, and several scenes in ""Sugar Rush"" are clich√©d and lazily scripted, the film as a whole exceeds. The ending is very satisfying, and features a plot manipulation that is brilliant. Ralph is sure to become one of the prized characters in the Disney catalog. Wreck-It Ralph is anything but a disaster."

"ironhorse_iv","9","5","6","31 January 2013"," Game on! Taking on life one game at a time.
","Wreck-It Ralph is such a good movie, and it really does show that Disney doesn't really need Pixar to make good animation movies. The film tells the story of the titular 8 bit arcade game villain named Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) who is tired of playing the villain, getting ostracize by his co-workers and force to live in ruins of his old stump. I like how John Reilly stumbles in his lines, but it still felt real to me. The movie does a great job visual to make it seem like 8 bit world, even to the point of using jerky motion that spoofs the limited animation cycles of 8 bit characters. He rebels against his role and dreams of becoming a hero. He sees that the only way he can be a hero is to game jumps to another game to win a medal to earn their respect. When the Arcade closes at night, video games characters in its games are allow leave their normal roles and are free to travel to other games through plugs that lead to a place known as Game Central Station, but have to return to their game in the morning, if not the game would seem broken, and in worst cases. Shut down. Since Wreck-It Ralph hasn't return, the game Fix-It-Felix Jr. is now in danger of just that. The hero Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) is starting to think that Ralph went 'turbo'. Going 'turbo' is name for a video game character whom went to another game, and try to sabotaged it, causing both games to be shut down. He soon find out that Ralph has gone to a first-person shooter game call Hero's Duty. Hero's Duty is a Call of Duty, Halo, type of game, lead by Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) where the game's winner receives a medal after fighting Cy-Bugs. Felix soon find out that he crash-land in another game called Sugar Rush, a kart-racing game similar to that of Mario Kart. Ralph searching for medal, meets Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a glitchy character whom like Ralph is shun by her game mates. Being PG makes Sarah Silverman so much more bearable, as she tend to too raunchy, but still Vanellope von Schweetz at first is such a annoying character, but the character's charm grow on you. It seems like a lot of critics hated her. I mean, she was annoying, but no more than a kid would be in most movies. Seriously, I swear most critics have completely mistaken her for an adult character because they constantly treat her like one, talking about how annoying she is when she's freaking nine! The way she acts is like how most 9-year-olds act! At least she was somewhat sympathetic. Ralph helps Vanellope build a kart to fight against it. King Candy (Alan Tudyk) the ruler of this world, refuse to let her participate, claiming that she is not really part of the game and her winning would cause the game to be shut down. Alan does a really good job on the voice, sounding more like Ed Wynn then his normal voice. This is where Ralph is force to decide about being the villain in the eyes of Vanellope to save her, or be the hero which will cause the end of both Fix-it Felix and Sugar Rush. A hard choice to pick. The final act has the most emotional and greatest twist to any movie that came out in 2012. The movie also contains a number of other video game references, to the point that I heard people calling this film the ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit of video games"" or ""Toy Story with video game characters"". The film includes characters, sight gags, and dialogues from games like Super Mario Bros, Paperboy, Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac-Man, Final Fantasy Q*Bert, Street Fighter and others. I geeked out quite a bit seeing them. My favorite reference is Metal Gear. How much cooler would the movie be, if the games were from a Flynn Arcade referencing Tron? To me the big name video game characters seemed a little tacked on because they didn't affect the story all that much, and that's a downer in a way. Of course the Copyrighted characters aren't in it for very long, but I think it's pretty impressive that they got as much as they did, but then again, this is the very growing media empire that is Disney we're talking about. While they didn't use the cameo characters to their highest potential. I almost feel it would have distracted the focus of the movie from the characters that the story revolves around to the established video games characters. I feel the cameos were not necessary, but at the same time it is icing on the cake. The movie works due to it's use of video game nostalgia, while building a clear colorful visual worlds where the characters can come in and out as they want. It's a visual spectacle. It was great for what it was: a child's movie covering adult themes with a video game background with humor that sharp. I think it would have been so much better if it focused on Ralph. He became a side-kick in his own movie when Vanellope comes in. There also so many story lines, and the romance of side-characters was so tacked on. Again, it's already a good film, but stating it could have been way cooler if it allow Ralph's journey to continue. Vividly creative setting and concept, extremely likable characters, but obscured by a kind of clich√© attention-grabbing comic relief character for parts of it, but worth watching."
"BlairMcLovin","8","5","6","6 January 2013"," I enjoyed being hit in the face with this nostalgia wand of a film
","I found the conceit of the film to be quite brilliant as it set the stage for some very cool video game throwbacks which I absolutely loved. However I was often puzzled that these fairly obscure references were used in a film which employed some pretty juvenile humour (in particular when the Sarah Silverman character was involved).<br/><br/>The look of the film is pretty spectacular with each world rendered successfully in different video game styles, in particular the candy land sequences which (here it comes) made me want to eat candy.<br/><br/>The things that keep it from greatness are the usual trappings of an animated film with this budget, whereby they must hit all the necessary emotional beats and hold back from doing anything too narratively unusual. But in spite of this straightforwardness I did find myself a tad choked up in certain parts, so for what it set out to do the story's solid.<br/><br/>Wreck It Ralph is an enjoyable romp with many a fun video game reference to be had and an economical and successful story that I can't imagine not appealing to many people, so check it out and be entertained, but not challenged.<br/><br/>Also Ralph gets hit the face twice when the Rihanna song begins playing, I choose not to take this as a coincidence."
"Troy_Campbell","8","5","6","29 December 2012"," A terrific Xmas treat for the whole family.
","It's quite apt that a large portion of Disney's latest animated adventure takes place within an arcade game called Sugar Rush, as it's the perfect description for this colourful, high-tempo caper. When Ralph (John C. Reilly) decides he no longer wants to be the bad guy for the Fix-It Felix Jr. video game ‚Äì after three decades of unrecognised service ‚Äì he treks out to other machines in search of heroic glory. The tale of accepting who you are is as old as cinema itself, however the joy here is in the eclectic characters and their fish-out-of-water experiences. The Mouse House has a bit of coin and as such we get a vast array of identifiable faces ‚Äì the ""baddies anonymous"" meeting in the opening scene features everyone from Sonic the Hedgehog's villain Dr Eggman, Mario's nemesis Bowser and a Pacman ghost ‚Äì yet it's the made-up avatars that truly shine. The eponymous klutz Ralph and his nice-as-pie foe Felix (Jack McBrayer) are fantastic polar opposites, whilst Hero Duty's battle-hardened warrior Calhoun (Jane Lynch) and Sugar Rush glitch Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) pinch the limelight whenever on screen; the former's penchant for badass one-liners and the latter's indefatigable enthusiasm both proving to be infectious and memorable. A terrific Christmas treat for the whole gang."

","The villain's point of view has been a popular theme for animated movies recently, with ""Despicable Me"" and ""Megamind"" the most popular. ""Wreck-it Ralph"" is the latest film to focus on this theme, taking a similar approach to ""Toy Story"" by centering on the sentient lives of video game arcade characters.<br/><br/>Wreck-it Ralph (John C. Reilly) is the bad guy from ""Fix it Felix Jr"", a thirty-year-old arcade game similar to the old Donkey Kong and Mario arcade game. Ralph is sick of being a villain and enters the game ""Hero's Duty"" in an attempt to win a medal and gain some respect. An encounter with Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) from kid-friendly cart game ""Sugar Rush"" (a little girls' version of Mario Kart) helps him find respect and redemption.<br/><br/>While it's produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, this isn't the saccharine Disney films of the past. ""Wreck it Ralph"" does a brilliant job of setting up a plausible world where the arcade characters come to life once the doors are closed, with a massive Subway system linking all the game worlds together, and a set of rules to keep the characters out of trouble. In a nice touch, the animation mimics the mannerisms of the old arcade games, complemented by the 'Nintendo-core' sound effects. While the film plays it fairly safe, its heart-warming without turning off the adults. There's also cameo appearances from famous video game characters: Sonic and Dr. Robotnik, Ken, Ryu, Bison and Zangrief, Bowser, Pac Man and his ghosts (the villains' 'Bad-Anon' meeting is held inside the Pacman game) and Q-Bert, as well as references to other video games. This will hold plenty of appeal to nostalgic adults who played these games as kids and ensure the film will have a wide appeal. <br/><br/>The voice cast is quite impressive: John C Reilly and Sarah Silverman do a great job as the leads, with Silverman staying cute and wacky without being annoying, Jane Lynch as Calhoun, a tough soldier from ""Hero's Duty"" with 'the saddest backstory every created' and Jack McBrayer as the noble, optimistic Felix.<br/><br/>""Wreck-it Ralph"" is arguably one of the better animated films in the past couple of years and enjoyable for kids, adults and big kids alike."
"tavm","8","5","6","6 November 2012"," Wreck-It Ralph was another enjoyable Walt Disney computer-animated feature
","Just watched this computer-animated movie from Walt Disney Animation with my movie theatre-working friend. It's the story of Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) who's tired of being the villain of the Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer) video game because of the negligent treatment from the rest of the inhabitants of his game. So he goes to another one to get a medal and then another one where he meets a girl who feels as lonely as him. I'll stop there and just say that I throughly enjoyed the creative visuals employed throughout and the way the story went. Other voices like those of Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman were also good but I was most impressed by that of Alan Tudyk as King Candy which he seemed to imitate Ed Wynn for since the character looked like Wynn's Mad Hatter in Disney's Alice in Wonderland from 1951. In summary, Wreck-It Ralph gets a high recommendation from me."
"KoreanPenguin","8","6","8","19 December 2012"," Wrecking my little heart.
","As a gamer, I was completely taken by surprise at how much this movie captivated me. I was blessed as a child to be homeschooled, and through that, I experimented with games from essentially every genre and system. Luckily, I was able to play ancient titles, like Qbert and the ORIGINAL Donkey Kong. There are so many fun references and sound effects relating to old games from eons past, but at the same time, Wreck-It Ralph manages to captivate non-gamer audiences as well!<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is about a villain from an arcade game called Fix-It Felix. Ralph goes through and messes up a building, and Felix comes in to fix up the building, whilst Ralph is dropping crap on Felix, a la classic Donkey Kong. Eventually, Ralph just wants to fit in, seeing as he is always the bad guy, and THUS begins our hero-villain's journey.<br/><br/>I love the concept of Wreck-It Ralph, and the execution is flawless. It's a wonderfully animated film, and you grow attached to character's very quickly. I've never seen John C. Reilly as someone that I could grow attached to, but he proved me wrong with this one¬Ö Same for Sarah Silverman¬Ö Or Jane Lynch¬Ö Heck, they were all great. I should also mention that there were points in Wreck-It Ralph where I felt like the filmmakers were pulling my heart from my body, and then proceeded to step all over it, spitting on it, and crushing it. Absolutely heart- wrenching. I was torn up during Wreck-It Ralph. If you have a weak heart, you might perish while watching it. Also, a GREAT family movie. Just go see it.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph fixes my hope for John C. Reilly, and gets an 8/10."
"Dylanbeybladerchampion","10","6","8","2 November 2012"," Best Disney Movie of the 2000s
","Being a person who grew up with both Disney movies and video games I was really excited for this movie and it was better than I hoped it would be. It is filled with great characters that give us a wide array of comedic moments, dark moments, sad moments and happy moments and plenty of video game cameos including: Bowser, Dr. Eggman, Sonic the Hedgehog, Clyde, Frogger, Zangief, M.Bison and hundreds more. The main characters consist of Wreck-It-Ralph (John C Reilly) who grows tired of being the bad guy and getting no love from anyone so he ""goes Turbo"" and game-jumps to other games to get a medal so they will allow him to live in the penthouse and get a place on the top of the cake with the rest of the Nicelanders, Fix-It- Felix Jr (Jack McBrayer) who's the nicest guy you can meet and fixes anything he hits with his magic hammer. He's in love with Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) who is a no-nonsense army sergeant who's programmed with a tragic back story and Vanellope Von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) who is a 9-year-old girl who's very sarcastic, sassy, and energetic and wants to become a racer even though she doesn't know how to drive and near the end of the film you find out she's actually a princess. These characters have to save the games from a massive hoard of Cy-bugs that were multiplied from the one Ralph hatched after taking the medal from Hero's Duty as they don't know there in a game and will eat anyone and transform into whatever they eat. Most of this movie takes place in a Sugar Rush which is a gokarting game in a candy land world thats being ruled by King Candy (Alan Tudyk) who is very small, eccentric character that talks with a lisp who was once Turbo in an arcade racing game but when his game became unplugged for a more popular one he game jumped into that game and caused it to become unplugged to. In Sugar Rush he entered the game's code and removed Vanellope's code from the game which makes her a glitch and erases the racers and inhabitants memory so they have no memory of Vanellope being their princess so he can rule over as their beloved king and he tries to prevent Vanellope from entering the race as if she completes it that will affect the game's code and return everything to normal. King Candy makes for a very great Disney villain who's both comical and villainous but also has his subtle moments where he makes himself look like a good guy. This movie was really fun and enjoyable with great animation, great references to other video games and sweets and its humour and writing are good enough for anyone to enjoy even if they are not big video game fans."
"diac228","7","6","8","2 November 2012"," Fresh Story full of Familiar Flavor, Wreck-It Ralph is nostalgically entertaining
","Wreck-it Ralph is Hollywood's latest foray in to the subculture world of gaming---a world that Hollywood essentially knows nothing about, with examples I refuse to mention so I don't have the sensation of throwing up. Except this time its Disney turning on the nostalgia while delivering a fresh story that involves a mixing of classic-style arcade games with the new-school arcade hits that we currently see. So what we have is a pure gamer movie, right?<br/><br/>Not quite. It is not a gamer's movie, it is really an animated movie with many, many nods to the world of arcade and console gaming. There is a major difference. You don't have the pacing, style, mood, and tone of a video game here unlike the visually stimulating whirlwind of a trip we experienced in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Instead you have a movie with a major Disney touch and essentially becoming the modern-day version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit---a new cast of characters being joined by dozens of cameos from old-school favorites. <br/><br/>Don't let this statement deter you, just let it allow you to hover your mind around the fact that the cameos you saw in the trailer was not a sample, it was a display of the entire menu. Luckily for this movie, the cast of characters featured are very likable, have their moments to shine, and do propel the movie forward when the plot (and amount of references) gets stuck in the mud. From the lovable baddie Wreck-It Ralph to the adorably filthy and sarcastic Vannelope (brilliantly executed by Sarah Silverman, an underrated comedic gem), you will feel for the characters much like when you immerse yourself in a gigantic video game. You will root for the two as they both fight for a place in gaming society, in a world that mistreats the outcasts, gaming villains, and anything too retro. <br/><br/>In a sort of ironic twist, Disney and Nintendo (the current gaming leader) are very alike in mannerisms, and also very similar in how their audience reach prevents them from fulfilling their true potential. With Nintendo they aim to remain looking hardcore while attempting to reach out into the mainstream. With Wreck-It Ralph, it was a kids movie full of sight and verbal gags that will giggle the children and tweens while severely pushing heavy and subtle gaming references to the 80s, 90s, and gamers of today even. There is a Leroy Jenkins reference for crying out loud. Surely everyone gets their spoonful of fun, but it prevents the movie from truly pushing towards something edgy, something more. <br/><br/>But what they do deliver, is a delightful movie that is chock full of nostalgia and originality. This awkward mix works for the company that saved the gaming industry, and works for the film that celebrates it."
"rgkarim","9","7","10","3 November 2012"," Wreck on Ralph, Wreck On!
","Disney has been busy this week with its business transactions. Not only have they just acquired Lucas' studio, but this weekend they decided to release their latest animated film Wreck-it-Ralph. For those of you without Disney Channel/ABC family watchers, or have missed the trailers before the movie, this is a film about video games. It starts out with a large hand, wild haired, bum look alike named Wreck-it-Ralph (John C. Reilly), who has been programmed to destroy a hotel complex that overtook his home. Fixing his path of rampage is a high pitched, repairman with a golden hammer named Fix-it-Felix (Jack McBrayer) who at the end of the day gets the glory, while Ralph gets the heave ho into the mud. Constant lack of Recognition though leads Ralph to leaving his game though, all in the pursuit of a token of glory he feels will change his life. So what did this reviewer think of this latest chapter in the Disney media? Read on to find out<br/><br/>To start my review off, I'll start with one of the movie's biggest strengths, the comedy. Many people who might be thinking, ""This comedy is just for gamers,"" are sadly mistaken in this viewer's opinion. Yes, there are plenty of video game references to please my fellow electronic players, many of which are cleverly integrated into the story to keep the film fun and exciting. References like Mario Kart, Metal Gear Solid, and Pitfall are thrown throughout the movie that will have any seasoned veteran laughing in their seats and perhaps even calling out the reference in the theater. However, if you're not that big on gaming, or have a very limited experienced in the game department don't worry there are plenty of other things to make you laugh. The writers of the movie filled most of the dialog with a load of puns that are both cute and clever. Many of these puns are jokes you've probably heard a thousand times when hanging out with friends, but for me they still made me laugh. Even the scenery and world design was quite punny, taking brand names of some products and turning them into environmental hazards and traps. Of course if you don't like puns, then this movie might annoy you after the sixth or seventh pun. However, for those who are young at heart like me, you won't be disappointed. Not a fan of puns, well there is one last humor style in this movie that may persuade you to see the movie, a style I call Sue Sylvester style. Those who love the hot-blooded cheerleader coach from Glee will be happy to see her essentially digitalized into this movie in the form of Calhoun the army leader. Out of the hallways and into the battlefield Calhoun insults every single game entity that crosses her path, crossing into the word cover up lines like pussywillows at times. If you're worried that her character will play a minor role in this movie, have no fears for Calhoun is in most of the movie.<br/><br/>The other thing this movie has going for it is the cute fun adventure that was laid out by their studios. I found very little, if any slow parts in this movie, as the directing team kept the adventure fast and on the move going from world to another. Each of the worlds added another element to Ralph's character helping him discover the dormant hero sleeping inside of him. This adventure first has promise of dark, awesome action in the first person shooter world, which I can't lie I wanted to see more of. Once our team gets to Sugar Rush though, the cuteness floods out into the theater. Not only is the world itself a cute display of candy coated puns and Disney cartoon citizens, but it also unfolds the relationship part of the story between Ralph and Venelope (Sarah Silverman). The pint sized driver has some spunk to her lines, but also has the ability to melt your heart with big eyes and even bigger heart. Her character's background is a story of its own that integrates smoothly into the main plot, though it may bring a few awws out of you. Both stories have the same underlying message, and may even inspire you in some manner, either that or make you roll your eyes at being too cheesy. Despite the fun cuteness though and evolution of Ralph's goals, the story is still predictable lacking very few twists from the trailer. However, if you're taking kids to see it, or you're a kid at heart you might not mind it. <br/><br/>What else is there to say about this movie? Again there is pretty good balance between the characters staying on the screen, which of course keeps the laughs fresh and new. On top of that the animation was very impressive for me. The characters moved based on their video games, such as the classic 8 bit blocky movements that were the precursor to modern games. What also made me happy was that I was able to follow all of the action scenes in this movie, instead of watching glitch filled, shaky camera shots that take away from the detail. Well at least most of the camera work didn't take away from the detail, unfortunately Hero's Duty was a little chaotic to follow and the brief screen time for the battle with the bugs was a little disappointing. Even the soundtrack was quite enjoyable and most of the songs fit perfectly with the scenes they were representing, especially Owl City's theme at the end.<br/><br/>Wreck it Ralph is definitely a fun family film, and quite clever in many aspects. However, if cute and punny isn't your cup of tea, then you best sitting this one out for now. My scores for this movie are the following: Comedy/Family: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5"

","I've seen some great animation films of this year such as ParaNorman and Frankenweenie and some disappointing ones such as Ice Age 4 and Brave but in my opinion none can be better than Wreck-It Ralph. This film is definitely a superbly crafted film. <br/><br/>I love the story in Wreck-it Ralph. Its an extremely unique film with great characters. I loved the characters Felix and Ralph and as time went by, I really began to like the character Vanellope. I loved the relationship between Vanellope and Ralph. <br/><br/>The pacing of the film is extremely well done and unlike other animation masterpieces such as WALL-E or the Incredibles, in which the pacing is slow at times. The voice acting was brilliant and the story continued to make me love the film. <br/><br/>The directing and execution is superb and this has to be one of the better FILMS of 2012 along with Dark Knight Rises, the Avengers and the Hobbit."
"Matt_Layden","8","4","5","7 November 2012"," The Best Animated Film of the year
","Disney, taking a cue from Pixar, showed a short film before the screening of Wreck it Ralph. It was a cute mixture of different forms of animation, titled Paperman. A paper pusher runs into a woman on his way to work, everything in this world is black and white, like paper. Except for her lips, which are red. He is instantly infatuated with her and when a piece of paper blows onto her face, her red lipstick sticks makes a mark. He can't stop thinking about her and when he sees that she is in the building across the street, he decides to put all those papers to use. Cute, well thought out and conveys great emotion without a single word used. <br/><br/>I hope every animated feature starts putting out shorts because it's a nice addition. Now, onto Wreck it Ralph. I'm in mid mid twenties, so the idea of retro game characters coming to life when the lights go out, think of Toy Story, appealed to me greatly. The first half of this film, I enjoyed immensely, it took me back to my childhood. The second half, my girlfriend enjoyed immensely, because everything was bright and colourful candy. <br/><br/>Wreck-it Ralp is tired of being a villain. No one talks to the bad guys and everyone loves the good guys. Fix-it Felix earns medal after medal for beating the game and Ralph is tired of it. He wants his own medal, he wants to be part of the group. When he hears of another game, Hero's Duty, a first person shooter where you can get a medal, he game jumps. Something that is forbidden. When Ralph accidentally finds himself in an escape pod, with the medal and an alien creature from the game, it zooms out of the game and game jumps yet again, into Sugar Rush, a mario kart styled game where everything is edible. If he doesn't get back to his own game in time, it won't be playable and deemed broken. If a game is broken it gets unplugged, if it gets unplugged, the game characters have nowhere to go. Can Ralph get back to his own game in time to save himself and everyone else? Will the alien he was stuck with infect Sugar Rush? Can Ralph finally be a hero for once?<br/><br/>All these questions are answered in this fully realized game that had me smiling from start to finish. Sure it tends to be more conventional as it goes on, but that didn't bother me because I was immersed in this world. You know screen you play on in the arcade? Well, the characters see it too, in fact they see you, the gamer, playing them. When the lights go out, they all go to game central, you'll see the likes of Sonic, Q-bert, Pacman, and many many more. Half the fun is looking in the background for cameo characters.<br/><br/>Ralph is a character with one goal, become a hero. Clear cut, the characters he meets along the way help and hinder his goal. We follow him from point A to point B. As I mentioned before, the first half of the game will appeal to the older crowd, while the second half will appeal to the younger crowd. Characters make fun of the title Hero's Duty, so you know there is some potty humour involved. <br/><br/>There are a lot of in joke references for the gamers out there. I won't reveal them because that takes away the surprise of it all. Suffice to say, Wreck it Ralph works. They set up the rules of their world and follow through on them. Everything mentioned at one point in the film has a purpose and comes into play later on. Nothing in the film is a throw away. That's why I enjoyed it so much. <br/><br/>Kids will love it, specifically Sarah Silverman's character of Vanellope. Adults will like it because the story is well thought out and the comedy delivers. There's something for everyone in Wreck-it Ralph."
"TheConnoisseurReviews","10","4","5","4 November 2012"," ""Wreck-It Ralph"" Review
","""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a movie with a lot of underlying messages and themes. From accepting oneself to trying to reach for a better life, it has it all. There is even an underlying message of the blue collar worker becoming jaded with his life and wanting something more. Tired of being treated horribly just because his job isn't as glamorous as the next guys. It also builds on the theory that everyone has their place in the world regardless of how badly you maybe treated right now. It's all about dusting yourself off and trying to change the way the world sees you.<br/><br/>The film is directed incredibly well. Every side story is handled with care and the same amount of detail as the main story so it doesn't feel tacked on. Characters are well highlighted and developed, showing their strengths and weaknesses. The visual gags are funny and it's incredibly fun trying to find your favorite classic video game characters. Writing is what makes this movie so enjoyable. It has smart and funny humor that caters to both adults and children. Never once talking down to it's audience. The film even uses pop-culture references in a smart and classy way to a point where it's funny. However, the movie doesn't rely just on the jokes to get by, there is a lot of heart in the story. The relationship between Ralph and Venellope is touching. There is a lot of emotional depth to the movie as well as many light-hearted funny moments and they're blended very well together.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a bunch of classic video game characters strolling through the screen, well look no further, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" has them. They aren't as integral to the story as many would hope, but it's fun trying to find your favorites. Even though your favorite game characters aren't important to the main story, they help create a very fun and interesting world and they even get some funny moments.And there are plenty of references please the gamers.<br/><br/>The real stars of the movie are Ralph, Vanellope, Fix-It Felix Jr, Sgt. Calhoun, and King Candy. All characters are great and they have their own time to shine. Ralph is a 9ft and 600+ lbs goliath with a quick temper, but a heart of gold. He is the every man and it's really easy to root for him. John C. Riley does a fantastic job of voicing the character and he knows how to balance the humor with the heart. Vanellope is a glitch in the game ""Sugar Rush,"" a Mario Kart-esque game, She is very sweet and cute. Some people might be annoyed by her voice, but the moment the character appeared on screen, I fell in love with her. Sarah Silverman does a fantastic job of voicing her and making an annoying voice incredibly likable. Jack McBrayer voices Fix-It Felix Jr, a goody to shoe. He's likable and some very cute moment with Sgt. Calhoun, voiced by Jane Lynch. Calhoun is a tough military leader and she has this incredibly tragic back story that is actually pretty hilarious. King Candy, voiced by Alan Tudyk, is king of ""Sugar Rush."" He's very reminiscent of the Mad Hatter in the way he speaks. He's a fun character to watch on screen.<br/><br/>Animation is beautiful in this movie, some of Disney's best. The colors are bright and vivid, the different locations look unique and lush. It feels very much like a living breathing world. Each character also movies in a manor to their own game. And the use of music is excellent too. From the score by Henry Jackman to the music by various artists, they are all used incredibly well and only elevate every scene and moment. I love how each world had it's own sound.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is an awesome movie that excels on every level. It has gorgeous animation with a great score to back up everything happening on screen. The characters are likable and the cameos are fun and entertaining. The jokes all hit along with the pop-culture references. Incredible direction and script elevate the movie to the stratosphere. Above all else it has heart. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is the best animated movie this year and not only just that, but also one of the best films period of the year. Anyone can watch it and enjoy, it's not just for gamers. I give it 5/5, smart, witty, and fun with a lot of heart.<br/><br/>Awesomeness"

","This is a review for the latest Pixar film Wreck-it-Ralph, and I must say that it's by far the best film that I have ever seen. It starts out with a prologue said by Wreck it Ralph, the villain of the arcade game, fix it Felix Jr, saying how hard it is to love his job when no one likes him for doing it. It pans out to an Alcoholics Anonymous style meeting where all of the villains of today's popular video games gather round as a weekly support group. Ralph then states that he wants to be a hero now. He embarks on an incredible journey by game jumping. I saw this on the very first day when it premiered and I was blown away by the plot. To all of the gamers out there, I highly recommend this movie to watch."
"philipwing","9","4","5","2 November 2012"," Wonderful Movie for PG Family Members
","I'll start this review with this: Know your young children before you see this movie. Gunfire, alcohol references, and beating on objects. I don't want the ""Cars 2"" reaction.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is villain to hero movie, a division of Fish Out of Water. A Ludicrous number of game and movie references fill this movie, but understanding them wasn't necessary for my twelve year old daughter.<br/><br/>The arc of this story is a good reminder that every hero needs a great villain to bounce against. The movie has happy, funny, sad, and scary moments, put together like they should be. (I think they read ""Save the Cat"", a great book on screen writing.)<br/><br/>For the bizarre, Gameinformer, Game Stop's house gaming magazine, recommends this movie for the respect it gives to gaming characters.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about the music. A piece like Shrek's ""Hallelujah"" would have been nice, but the piece was OK.<br/><br/>I'm hopeful that Disney will convert the DCA Video Arcade *back* into the retro place they had for TRON. They now know what to put in there, including Rampage."

","I never saw Wreck-It Ralph when it came out, and after seeing ""Frozen"" and ""Big Hero 6"", I thought ""there's no way that this guy measures up to the likes of Elsa and Baymax!"" Boy, was I wrong! The overall film itself is made to tell the story of the video games we take for granted every day. Ralph is a bad guy trying to get along with the good guys, but every bad guy has his challenges. The power this film carries with it is amazing, about friendship, proving yourself, and accepting yourself for who you are.<br/><br/>The part at the end when he helps Vanellope finish the race sprouts the friendship in these two, who live only one trip through Game Central Station from each other. This film highlights the bond of two unlikely friends. One from a world where he's always the bad guy, and one from a world in which she's treated like a freak.<br/><br/>This film lives up to the immortal and nearly incomprehensible standards that Disney Animation Studios sets for itself, raising the bar every year with yet another animated, colorful, and sugary spectacle that will leave you with a warm heart and a craving for cake!"

","I'd heard so much about Wreck-It Ralph and how it brought together all these various video game characters from their respective games. I did not see this one in theaters, but I rented it and thought it was a fine non-Pixar film for any Disney or video gamer. I admit that I never got to play very many video games when I was younger, but I recognize most though not all of the characters in this movie if you don't count the main characters. And now they're talking about a sequel which comes out next year. Does that mean more video game characters? I hope so. And maybe I'll watch it."

","It's a fun movie. I don't usually review kids movie but this movie is very good. This is the best animation movie in 2012. It's fun watching it in theaters and I have a blast. It's a worth a watch if you like animation movies.<br/><br/>Score: 9.5/10"
"nonprofitgnome1","7","2","2","4 August 2013"," A Solid Entry by Disney
","After a couple of years without a great, non Pixar, Disney animated movie, it seems like Disney is back on track. We first got Tangled and now this, Wreck-It Ralph. This movie was clearly made with young and old gamers alike in mind. There is a little something to like for everyone with this one.<br/><br/>The most obvious thing this movie has going for it is the nostalgia. For anyone who has been gaming, there are little easter eggs and nods to some of gaming's greatest all throughout the movie. There is one scene in particular where Ralph is at a Villains Annonymous meeting and it was great seeing the others in attendance (I will let you see for yourself).<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the fictional game worlds. Ralph was in three different game worlds, a ""Donkey Kong"" type game, a ""Call of Duty"" type game, and an arcade racing game. My personal favorite game world was the Call of Duty one. The soundtrack kicked in nicely and it was great to see Ralph frantically trying to survive. I did however think they spent too much time in the racing game ""Sugar Rush"". I know it was necessary for the plot points but I would have loved to see additional games (One can only hope for a sequel).<br/><br/>Aside from all the spectacle, the movie had a great story with an interesting theme. We get to see Ralph grow as a person as at first he is selfish and disregards others feelings in order to get his medal. He later realizes that the medal doesn't mean as much as he thought. We also get to see how the characters from his home game go from shunning him to realizing they need him. Ralph was treated poorly and no one cared until they realized without him, there is no game for them to live in. You really get to see that everyone has value as well as the importance of teamwork.<br/><br/>I don't think Wreck-It Ralph is on the same level as some Pixar movies but it should please gamers and anyone looking for a visually appealing animated movie with heart."

","One of best animation films it will rekindle your memories of playing video games like donkey kong and then over to role playing games. this movie is so detailed in the description of its characters you will notice that movement of characters from 8-bit games is different from those in modern games, even the casting is so wonderfully detailed. You will feel so great while watching this, it would be like you were waiting fora movie like this to come up to theaters. Sarah silverman's perky voice for Vanellope is absolutely amazing. it is an absolute treat for retro gamers like me.this movie clearly deserves a greater rating and an Oscar for this year."
"siddharthpillai99","8","2","2","17 July 2013"," Fun for the whole family! Very enjoyable :)
","You may find ""Wreck-It Ralph"" somewhat along the lines of ""Toy Story"", as the story is about arcade game characters coming to life, and ""Toy Story"" is about toys coming to life. But nevertheless, I found this movie very enjoyable and fun to watch. Despite the views of many others on IMDb, I thought this movie's idea was original because, come on, I've never seen a movie about arcade game characters, have you? <br/><br/>If you lived during the arcade game peak-point (the 80's and 90's), you will definitely enjoy ""Wreck-It Ralph"", as it brings back classic games, such as Pac-Man and Mario (although Mario is never seen in th movie, which was kind of disappointing). I also think they should have included more real-life arcade games, however others would argue that it would make the movie less original. <br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph, a huge and muscular villain of the game Fix-It Felix Jr. is a very funny character, and the script-writers have done a great job making the movie about him, rather than a hero.<br/><br/>Overall: Great! Go see it with your friends! Go see it with your family! Go see it by yourself! It's worth it :)"

","An incredible journey! The movie has a unique and innovative concept, the characters are interesting and relateable, and the story has a lot of heart.

Otherwise, the movie is entertaining from beginning to end. The spectacular animation and graphics breathe life into these game characters.

","Wreck-It Ralph<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>108 mins/PG <br/><br/>Cast: John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch, Alan Tudyk, Ed O'Neill, Dennis Haysbert<br/><br/>Director: Rich Moore<br/><br/>Plot: Ralph, the villain of the hugely popular arcade game 'Fix it Felix Jr.', is fed up with being the bad guy so he sets out to become the hero, causing wreckage wherever he goes.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: 'Wreck-It Ralph' is the best animation from Disney in years. Set in an arcade, the animation brings the whole video-game theme to life. Each game's characters can travel through the wires in the plug socket, which leads to a version of Grand Central Station in which characters from different games can mingle. The whole universe created inside the arcade is subject to unlimited scope and artwork, which is presented beautifully. This being a video-game film of course has hundreds of cameos from famous characters such as Bowser, Sonic the Hedgehog and Pac-man and enthusiasts could literally watch this film just to pick out every single homage and reference to real games and their characters. The film's main character is Ralph (John C. Reilly well voice-casted). Ralph is bigger than everyone else which means everyone is scared of him, which of course means he has no friends. To make matters even worse, being a villain, he always loses. Determined to stop this, he seeks out other games to find a gold medal that would find him accepted as a hero. While looking for his medal he finds an unlikely friend in Vanellope, a glitch. However because Ralph has been away from his game, it stops working, so together the two have to save the arcade from game over. The film really makes you sympathise with Ralph, and although some scenes with him and Vanellope drag on, 'Wreck-It Ralph' is super fun for all the family."
"diadectes58","8","2","2","23 March 2013"," It has a bit of everything
","I saw this movie in 2D at the cinema the other week. I was not expecting too much but I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the film. It has a bit of everything: pathos; excitement; thrills; action; tension; love; plot twists; surprise ending; nostalgia; good characterisation etc. It's a good story that keeps you involved and interested all the way through. The film gets you involved and soon has you rooting for the characters. It helps if you are young enough to have played the games shown in the film or have children (or grand children) who have - but this is not essential for your enjoyment. Definitely worth seeing whether you are young or old."
"tuomas_gimli","10","2","2","17 March 2013"," A triumph
","Wreck-it Ralph is without a doubt one of the best animated films of the last few years. Though advertised as the ultimate love letter to video games, it's actually more of a story about identity and redemption that merely happens to take place in the world of video games. Though that's not to say there aren't tons of references to video games both old and new, and they will definitely keep hardcore gamers satisfied. The references are handled tastefully, and the film never feels like pandering to a specific audience though obscure references and inside jokes.<br/><br/>The characters are truly what makes the film work. Ralph's dissatisfaction with his life is understandable, but it's never made black and white that he would be right and everyone else wrong. Sarah Silverman's character Vanellope starts out as annoying and hyperactive, but eventually grows on the audience. There is one genuinely tragic moment between Vanellope and Ralph that almost had me in tears. The supporting characters are also well handled, and Sergeant Calhoun in particular makes an odd case of being so much more than what she's supposed to, i.e. a brutal parody of the ""badass chick"" trope seen in many video games. But she actually has depth to her.<br/><br/>The movie is also side-splittingly hilarious. Though getting the references gets you slightly more laughs out of the film, most of the comedy is universally understandable. The visuals are breathtakingly beautiful, and the landscapes in ""Sugar Rush"" (a racing game where most of the film takes place) show some true imagination and inventiveness. Mentioning that the voice acting is superb feels almost pointless. This is Disney we're talking about, after all. Towards the end there is a surprising twist I honestly did not see coming, and those are always a plus.<br/><br/>If one would want to search for gripes in this movie, the biggest one would probably be its length. It's not too long, about a 105 minutes, but towards the end you may start thinking when the movie is truly going to end. There's also quite a lot of rules the film has to establish in order to make the world make sense, but they don't take up too much time.<br/><br/>But aside from those, I can find very little to criticize about Wreck-it Ralph. This is quite simply a masterpiece of animated cinema, and I definitely hope to see this particular world explored more."
"kodyfacebook","10","2","2","15 March 2013"," This Film Wrecks a Path to Your Heart
","I know what you're thinking. Why does this film warrant a full 10 stars from me? Well I'll be honest, if you don't like video games, this film will probably just be a 6 or 7 to you. But if you do - this film has it ALL.<br/><br/>Me and a friend saw it in 3D and it was nothing to sneeze at, but I'd recommend the Blu-Ray version - the colors are very crisp and you can see the detail in every character and environment (a crucial helper for spotting references, believe me, you're gonna need it)<br/><br/>The film is the basic bad guy existential crisis plot that's been covered by a few other films, but not to this unique and well-developed angle.<br/><br/>The hero/villain travels to 3 different game cabinets, and the animators managed to make each game look completely distinguished, but connect the emotion and plot progression through each. (Fix-It Felix Jr. With pixels/voxels and limited frames of animation; Hero's Duty with sharp angles, colors and sound; and Sugar Rush with pure food porn - you want to reach out and take a bite out of every ""rock"" and ""tree"")<br/><br/>The voice-acting is top-notch, especially by The main cast and Alan Tudyk, reminding me of a certain Hatter with his performance.<br/><br/>This movie also struck a chord with me on a personal level. I was born into the gaming world, and recognized most all the nods to our culture that even most TV shows get wrong. It really made me feel connected to the characters and universe, and made me really care about the story. Toy Story was for the 90s kids what Wreck-It Ralph is to the 2000s.<br/><br/>This movie contains two visual references to alcohol and minimal cartoon violence.<br/><br/>I'd recommend Wreck-It Ralph to all ages and all genders if they like video games. And to the parents of said people, there's still a lot to love."

","In the arcade game Fix-It Felix 2, Ralph's function is to smash things up so that Felix can fix them. Fed up with being his game's villain even once the arcade closes, Ralph takes himself off to see if he can find redemption (or, at least, a medal like the ones Felix earns) elsewhere in the world of arcade games.<br/><br/>I'm sure it must help if you have a familiarity with computer games, because there are guest cameos here from loads of games from the very start of the arcade game era, but this is a pretty solidly entertaining movie anyway. The story is relatively straightforward but very well structured, with small touches from earlier earning big payoffs towards the end. The visual element of the film is dazzling and witty, and reflects perfectly the consistent advances in video game visuals over the years. And the characters are great, and brilliantly voiced, with Sarah Silverman standing out. They all have wonderful character development arcs in a story which is exciting and, at times, very emotional.<br/><br/>I loved this film.<br/><br/>The 3D was immersive without being flamboyant."

","To all the kids who were born in the 70s and 80s (or some early 90s), arcade games are so popular. Even though they played them regularly or not, they are still there in everyone's minds. When they watched Wreck-it Ralph, I think that all that ""kids"" will not able to hold back their memories of Pacman, Mario, Fix-it Felix... And that is the reason why people keep telling me that movie is for gamers only. And just because of that reason, I didn't watch the movie earlier, which makes me regret. I don't know many characters in the movie, only Mario, Pacman and guys in Street Fighters. Due to my shortage of knowledge, I realized more than just a memoirs of game characters. Everything has its two-sided and once people spotted your bad manner, they will always judge you as a bad guys. It's OK, whatever, the person who is deep inside you is much more important. You are bad and at least it's good because you know who you are :)"

","Before I went into this film I had a feeling it was going to be good, I just didn't know how good. Honestly it's such a rarity to have high expectations for a film nowadays and have those expectations completely dwarfed by what's put in front of you.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph draws comparisons to Toy Story and it's easy to see why. It's basically has the same premise, characters that come to life once they are not being played with and no humans are around to see what they are getting up to during their ""social"" hours. To me though, once the lights go out in the arcade, Wreck-It Ralph is something completely different.<br/><br/>Our main protagonist, Ralph, is unloved and sick of his job. A job which means having to play the villain all the time. Ralph however, wants to change things and his idea of doing this is to make his way into another game and earn himself a medal to show off and earn some respect from his peers.<br/><br/>Of course this doesn't go according to plan and Ralph's efforts end up in all kinds of destruction, interfering in not one but two new game worlds. Along the way he meets Calhoun, King Candy & the absolutely adorable Vanellope.<br/><br/>For me, Sarah Silverman's Vanellope steals the show completely. If you don't want to pick her up and giver her a hug after Ralph has Hulk smashed an object that means the world to her then you have no heart.<br/><br/>There are of course, many memorable characters in this film. Alan Tudyk as villain King Candy is an absolute blast, playing the character as classic comic book camp initially then moving into real vicious territory as the film moves along and his motives become clearer.<br/><br/>The story moves along at a fair pace. Moving between different game worlds, showing us the goings on in the real world of the arcade and giving each character enough time to shine. There is rarely, if ever, a dull moment in the film. I was having enough fun at the start of the film just trying to spot all the different video game characters from my youth, that have been lovingly & brilliantly captured on-screen.<br/><br/>I really can't recommend this film enough. It has managed to get the blend just right of appealing to both children and adults alike and must surely go down as a true Disney classic in years to come.<br/><br/>Go watch it, now. You won't regret it, I promise."

I loved this movie, up and down, from beginning to end. While I would liked to have seen more of my favorites growing up, like Street Fighter II and Pac-Man (well, Mrs. to be exact) the story of Ralph, his old and new peers, were absolutely awesome on their own.<br/><br/>I know everyone and their mother and grandchild loved the Shrek series, or at least the first two.

","Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game called ""Sugar Rush"". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.<br/><br/>I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever ‚Äì a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.<br/><br/>So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave (which was also very good).<br/><br/>John C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character, who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the ""Sugar Rush"" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a ""glitch"" (a character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock) has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main character in a first-person shooter game known as ""Hero's Duty"", who tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.<br/><br/>I didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp, pristine screen.<br/><br/>The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.<br/><br/>The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.<br/><br/>Generally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this movie, they're going to fall in love with it 10/10"

","Wreck-It Ralph is the latest Disney movie, but after watching it, the last thing you'll think about afterwards is ""Disney"". It takes place in an arcade, featuring many classic arcade games such as Pac-Man, Street Fighter II, Space Invaders, Frogger, Sonic the Fighters, TRON, Mortal Kombat and many, many more. But I digress.<br/><br/>The movie centers around a video game villain called Wreck-It Ralph. He's celebrating his game's 30th anniversary, and during the celebration, he starts to realize just how unappreciated he really is. He is overshadowed by the hero of his game, Fix-It Felix. So he goes on a quest to earn some respect and show that he can be good.<br/><br/>This movie was my most anticipated movie of 2012. I love animated movies, and I love video games. Video games are an important part of my everyday-life. And I know a lot about retro games and arcade games, so this movie was really awesome for me.<br/><br/>I'm gonna try not to go all gamer-gasm here, because this is after all a place for movies. But let's just get this out of the way: The video game references are amazing. They're just so hilarious and they're more obvious than in something like Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. This is by far one of the best animated movies of all time, and as weird as it may sound, the video game cameos and references are a huge part of that. It would've been cool to see the game references a bit more spread-out, because the movie goes all out in the beginning with reference after reference and cameo after cameo, but then becomes more of its own movie. I wish the references would spread more out and cover more than just the opening sequence. But it still makes for an overwhelmingly awesome first part.<br/><br/>The story is a bit on the weaker side. But the character development makes up for the movie's simple story. A lot of it centers around one side-character that at first comes off as a bit annoying, but after a while becomes more likable. The main character is also really fun to watch, and the villain, who starts off as terribly dumb and annoying, actually ends up being quite evil.<br/><br/>The movie centers around three different made-up arcade games: ""Fix-It Felix Jr."", ""Hero's Duty"" and ""Sugar Rush"". All three of these games contain very different art styles, and the movie would have for example characters from Hero's Duty and Fix-It Felix Jr. visit Sugar Rush, a game where none of them fit in. And this especially showed in the last part.<br/><br/>I like how symbolic the made-up arcade games are. I didn't notice it while watching the movie, but it seems that Fix-It Felix Jr. represents the ""retro gamers"", Hero's Duty represents the ""hardcore gamers"", and Sugar Rush represents the ""casual gamers"". I really thought that was a nice touch.<br/><br/>The animation is outstanding. Not only are the video game characters animated perfectly and they really fit the movie and setting, and it's just all fun to watch them on-screen. The 3D is nothing special, but it never gave me eye-strains, nor did it distract from the movie, so kudos to Disney for not ruining the movie with 3D.<br/><br/>Overall, Wreck-It Ralph is an awesome movie. Too bad it came out so late here in Norway, 'cause if it came out before January, I would've definitely put it on the number 1 spot on my top 10 movies of 2012 list on YouTube. Not only are the cameos and references amazing, but the movie itself is really entertaining and great. Some pacing issues during the middle, but mostly just greatness all around."

","While my hopes for this movie weren't entirely low, I didn't expect it to be amazing. I thought, it's gonna be one of those simple movies, unoriginal, no way it's gonna get an Oscar nod or get even close to my 2012 favorites. But guess what? It's not only in my favorites, it IS my favorite! As a Disney freak, it's hard not to please me, and this film was no exception. The relationship between Ralph and Vanellope was what really had me going, it was simply incredible, one of the best relationships I've seen in a film in a long time. Vanellope herself is an incredible, lovable character. It's witty and funny but still has enough heart to get you choked up (and that does not happen to me very often!) Phenomenal characters that I am thrilled to have in our Disney family now, great worlds, and a great story. This is only a semi-spoiler, but there is a plot twist near the end that may have left me in more shock than any movie before. I won't say what it is, but honestly, it didn't have to be done, therefore you wouldn't expect it (or at least I wouldn't). But all the same, it helped the plot, and left me gawking. I HIGHLY recommend this movie no matter who you are. While I may be a Disney fanatic, human movies nor video games are really my thing, but I ADORED this movie. So go see it!!!!"

Sugar Rush is so brilliantly delicious that I just felt like living there, the observations and the details throughout the film are priceless. <br/><br/>You'd think that maybe you'd be encouraged to dislike Ralph's nemesis Fix it Felix Jnr. - the good guy - but instead he almost steals the show!

","I came into this movie with really high expectations from the trailers, it succeeded them all. This movie reminds me of Toy Story just with video games, which is an automatic win for me. After 2 years of Disney Pixar films thats adults and older kids wouldn't be all over (Cars 2 and Brave), this one really changes the game and wins all those viewers back. The movie hit a lot of emotional tones, nothing to make you cry but still. Ralph is a really relatable characters and I'm glad Disney chose to focus on the bad guy for once. Felix is also a really cool character, hes a lot nicer to Ralph than the Nicelanders, you can tell he feels bad for the guy but he can't do much about it since all the Nicelanders hate him. Sargent Calhoun is also a great character she has a great back story and she really does make her mark in this movie. Her and Felix's relationship is great. Also i'm surprised by the number of Cameos of products there are, at one point a kid in the arcade has a Subway soda, and the O-REO part is easily one of the bests scenes in movie history. Along with product cameos come many great video game character cameos, I wont list all of them but lets just say your inner geek will come out at many points in this film. Towards the end King Candy is Turbo. I thought (me and the whole theater probably) that turbo was just a little thing they set up to be a reference, like when video game characters go bad and try to take over other games, easily the biggest twist in the movie. <br/><br/>Sorry for my bad typing and sentence fluency, I don't have an excuse Im just too lazy to edit this. This film was one of my Favorites of all time. You would be an idiot to not go and watch this movie right now. No matter what age, Wreck it Ralph is simply amazing."

","OK, so I'm not a gamer by any means & my review is going to be non-techy. Hey, I liked PacMan back in the day and now that seems archaic.<br/><br/>I went to see this Wreck-it Ralph because it looked like fun. And it was. This movie has beautiful visual colors/scenes and funny antics & lines galore. The storyline is very clever and engaging. And I loved the sessions with the other game icons, very cute. The actor voices were right on, especially Silverman. Wow, how can her voice sound like that?<br/><br/>What I wonder is will kids like this movie? To me it seemed rather adult in the story and I'm not sure a kid under 10 would necessarily get it. But an older kid or adult who likes animation and creativity will love it. It is amazing what they do with animation today and this really is a feast for the eyes. With a fast pace and good dialog, this movie kept my attention and had me laughing at times and leaving with a smile on my face. That's a good sign to me."
"DjMethod","8","2","2","13 November 2012"," There's no one I'd rather be than me
","Here is a warm, clever, and funny addition to Disney's animated canon. Wreck-It Ralph applies the general concept of Toy Story in a new and original way. The entire film is illuminated with familiar video game characters and little gamer jokes from invisible walls to jerkier, less developed side characters. <br/><br/>The overarching Armageddon subplot could have been handled better since it has us nearly forgetting about it in an effort to focus on developing the main characters and their own interests. Ralph seems to be oblivious throughout the film about the fact that he pretty much threatens everyone's existence with his carelessness. <br/><br/>But Vanellope! The highlight of the film. She is the most adorable little character, although it is a bit creepy that she's essentially a mini-me of Sarah Silverman. Nonetheless, if this movie has a single strong point, it's that Vanellope will find a way to win you over.<br/><br/>The simple lesson of the film is conveyed well: grow to accept your identity."

","WRECK- IT RALPH (2012) **** (VOICES OF : John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, Adam Carolla, Alan Tudyk, Mindy Kaling, Joe Lo Truglio, Ed O'Neill, Dennis Haysbert, Edie McClurg, Rachael Harris, Rich Moore, Horatio Sanz.) Fun-tastic Disney animated comedy about video game 'villain' Wreck-It Ralph (wonderful work by Reilly) whose conflict ion in celebrating the 30th anniversary of his work dovetails with his desire to no longer be the 'bad guy' and takes it upon himself to become a hero, in spite of possibly destroying other games in the process. Funny, fast, frenetic and dazzlingly candy colored confection that will have gamers (and non-gamers) digging the pop culture riffing on the genre's characters (a great bit is a take on a support group for villains ala Alcoholic Anonymous! a big risk for a family film that pays off its gambit with guffaws). Great vocal work by McBrayer as 'nemesis'/friend Fix-It Felix, Jr. whose sweetness is his Achilles' heel; Lynch as a Sigourney Weaver/Ripley action heroine named Calhoun is very tough and sexy (yes sexy as in Jessica Rabbit sexy!) and the scene-stealing (film stealing) Silverman as the caffeinated pixie 'glitch' Vanellope who befriends and bedevils Ralph is a real wonder to watch (dare I say an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress? yes I do). A lively, smart original screenplay by Phil Johnston, Jennifer Lee, Jim Reardon and the director Rich Moore keeps things at full-throttle. Takes animated family fare to the next level! One of the year's best films and surprises."
"otterprods","8","2","2","2 November 2012"," Brilliant casting, cleverly imagined world
","This is one of the best animated movies to come out in years. The concept is a ton of fun and they do an excellent job of blending the three converging world of 8-buit game graphics, cg game graphics and the outside world. Hoard to explain, but you should find that to be the most clever and original part of this movie. The visuals are beautiful and the world is wonderfully imagined with a solid set of 'rules' to keep everything within the realm of believability, in a fantasy sense. There is lost of fun humor and some absolutely brilliant characters. The best part is the voice casting. The casting, which was just perfect, especially for the four main characters. John C. Reilly should get some kind of Oscar for best VO-acting. <br/><br/>The reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I really don't give anything a 10, other than maybe one or two movies EVER. I feel that people give out tens (or five stars, as the case may be) too easily which dilutes the power of a 'perfect' 10.<br/><br/>The reason I didn't give it a 9 was because of a few shortcomings, specifically: 1) Some potty and insult humor. 2) A few juvenile, catch-phrase crutches where something more clever could have been used without sounding pretentious. 3) Some overused themes, like 'Appreciate Yourself for Who You Are' and 'True friendship is more important than material rewards' -- but, hey, it's an animated movie, what would you expect? 4) (Hopefully this doesn't count as a spoiler, but...) The ending was weakened a little due to a predictable reveal that felt like something I've seen way too many times before.<br/><br/>But based on the clever concept, great characters and some really fun action, this easily moves up to be one of my top 10 favorite animated movies of all time. And just to put that in perspective, Up, Wall-E and Finding Nemo do NOT make that list for me (although most of the rest of Pixar movies do, The Incredibles being #1)."
"ben101120032003","10","2","2","5 November 2012"," I cried hard over this amazing movie
","I am definitely putting this amazing movie into my top 3 fav animations. There was so much laughter and so many tears. If you have not watched it, you should see it. Trust me and many other reviewers. It is a game changer and I have not been touched so deeply for a while. Sometimes I wonder about how much you would give up to become a true man. Ralph did it and that was just beautiful! I do not remember playing this particular game before. However, I do recognize the many similarities this game has towards many other games I have played. It is probably as good as ""toy story"", if not better than it!! Disney is picking up the game.Even the short story before the featured movie was such a great one. I think the ""paper man"" echoes with the ""Wreck-It Ralph"" movie in a sense that both found the missing part of their heart and both revealed the brightest side of their ""personality"". Being lonely can be a hard feeling, especially while you feel that others are enjoying their beautiful lives. This movie showed me that changes can only take place when you really want to make a change and fight hard for it. It is those who do not give up and who strive for the betterment that see the true meaning of life."
"klicc","5","22","46","7 February 2013"," Wrecked by selfish and unlikeable characters.
","My main issue with Wreck-It Ralph was how selfish and horrid the characters were, from the heartless and small-minded 'Nicelanders' to the bratty, irritating Vanellope. I spent the whole movie getting more and more exasperated at their actions and behaviour, from Calhoun constantly belittling Felix, to Vanellope stealing Ralph's medal and using it for herself, to the kid racers mocking her 'glitches' and destroying her car. There is such a thread of inherent nastiness to them that it's hard to accept the typically Disney-esque redemptive finale with any genuine empathy, after spending so much of the movie treating each other like dirt, the 'heroic' heart-warming moments that suddenly appear in the last half hour just seem out of character.<br/><br/>Can I also make the point here that I haven't even needed to mention any of the nefarious deeds perpetrated by the actual villain of the movie yet, because there's so much douchebaggery on show from the rest of them.<br/><br/>Some of the themes explored were quite serious, such as the ostracism of Ralph and Vanellope by their peers, in her case due to a 'glitch' condition that threw up some parallels with disability. Ralph is treated appallingly from the outset, his quest for acceptance triggered by an obnoxious secondary character called Jean, who later is laughably granted the moral high ground by the writers when Ralph returns with the medal he was told he would never get. In this scene, Jean's cold and calculated put-downs must have been intended to come across as sobering, but after using this character to instigate Ralph's at-times reckless and desperate journey, allowing him to castigate him further is particularly cruel and unjust.<br/><br/>Vanellope's character is a little different, in that she doesn't really have redeeming features at all, but you feel obliged to root for her because she is an outcast 'glitch', treated within her game/prison, 'Sugar Rush', like an extraneous anomaly. The emotive impact of her condition is milked for a bit, but with time and practice it proves to be a useful tool that she retains even after the happy ending, which means the parallels with genuine disability end particularly abruptly. Her cocky, bullish demeanour also grated with me, for example when she reacted with blind rage at Ralph when he tried to explain how she would endanger herself by driving meant that when he destroyed her car I had far less sympathy than I'm sure I was supposed to. <br/><br/>On a more positive note, the game references and art direction were superb; and the choice of an arcade was basically the only way this movie could work, despite it seeming a bit unrealistic to have something like Hero's Duty there, notwithstanding modern kids voluntarily spending their money on 30-year-old arcade games. The cynic in me feels that, like Cars, interesting issues were only explored half-heartedly in a film that ultimately targeted things children like - video games and candy in this case. There are moments of genuine humour, and despite the plot for the most part falling well short of what I hoped for there were a few neat twists that kept me interested, primarily involving Vanellope's picture on the outside of the machine, and the reveal of Turbo masquerading as the Candy King. <br/><br/>In closing, this film provided yet more evidence to me that it reflects how Americans are both the loveliest and the nastiest of people in equal measure. So many US shows rely on one-upmanship and bitchiness at the expense of other people for their laughs, but then overly sentimentalise other aspects of life to a degree that can seem absurd. The characters were so horrible in Wreck-It Ralph, but then spontaneously joined together in glorious harmony and celebration at the end, without any apparent learning curve or development to justify the transformation other than the fact that the nastiest and most selfish amongst them finally got his just desserts."
"clark44","10","5","8","15 November 2012"," Pure Video Game Magic
","First, a disclaimer: I consider myself to be a relatively moderate Disney animation fan. Sure, there are the great classics (e.g., ""Snow White""), the modern classics (""The Emperor's New Groove"") and the occasional underrated film (""The Rescuers Down Under""). But for the last decade or two, Disney movies have been more miss than hit... (three words: ""Mars Needs Moms"". What?) <br/><br/>Now, let me point out that video game movies have an even worse track record. I mean, let's be honest: nobody waxes eloquent about ""Wing Commander"" or ""Tomb Raider"" (daydreams about Lara Croft not included). The best we've gotten was occasional flashes of brilliance followed by intense disappointment... ""Tron: Legacy"", anyone? <br/><br/>So on the whole, the idea of combining Disney animation with video games seemed fundamentally flawed, if not outright doomed.<br/><br/>And yet, it works. It works really, surprisingly well. The cleverness is obvious: making the film around several ""familiar"" games that didn't really exist means the directors and screenwriters weren't hampered by the storyline baggage of imitating real game. Obviously, talented screenwriters and animators played a big part. It's such a relief, after this year's travesties like ""Prometheus"", to see a script that doesn't contain any large plot holes and actually builds on itself to advance the plot instead of relying on characters to bumble around randomly.<br/><br/>And yet the real brilliance of it is even more. Jerry Rees (director of ""The Brave Little Toaster"", perhaps the saddest children's movie ever made) said in a recent interview that ""fables have always been a way to move through our darkest fears to a place of hope"". ""Wreck-It Ralph"" works because the stakes feel both dire and real. That even though we're laughing at the main character and his friends telling stories at a ""Bad Guys Anonymous"" meeting, we feel his pain at being ostracized by the people he cares about. And we share his desire for a better life. Who wouldn't, after doing the same dead-end job for 30 years? <br/><br/>And unlike ""Tron Legacy"", which built up an interesting world, but then really didn't do anything with it, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" feels real because of the way the characters behave and interact. A quick scene in the movie showing Ralph giving some food to a homeless, ""unplugged"" Q*bert almost brought a tear to my eye. And if you don't consider that to be movie magic, then I'm afraid I can't help you."
"dfa120374","8","3","4","10 December 2014"," Another Superb Disney Animation
","Wreck It Ralph tells the story of Ralph, a video game character that is tired of being the ""bad guy"" all the time and sets out on an adventure to find a way of becoming a ""good guy"", but inadvertently causes madness & mayhem as he goes.<br/><br/>Disney have done it again with yet another animation classic in Wreck It Ralph. I loved this movie for a number of reasons, one being that it was a wee trip down memory lane in seeing characters from games I used to play as a kid, including Sonic the Hedgehog; Ken, Ryu, M. Bison and Zangief from the Street Fighter games; Kane from Mortal Kombat (one of my favourite games of all time); and Pac-Man. Even the two stick figures playing tennis from Pong are shown.<br/><br/>Some really good ideas enter into the movie as well, such as Game Central Station (which is basically a huge socket adapter that the arcade machines all get plugged in to) where all the game characters travel to and from their games when the arcade is closed. Another is the Bad-Anon which is a villains support group for any of the games bad guys for when they are feeling unhappy about their roles.<br/><br/>As we have come to expect from Disney movies as well the animation is absolutely superb. The way the animation gets handled between the different games in the movie is excellent also, going from the graphics we saw in the old console/arcade games where they were more blocky and jerkier (which was cutting edge back then) to the more sublime, smoother graphics we see for the newer games nowadays.<br/><br/>This is a movie that will appeal to all kids and adults alike. Some of the humour in the movie may be classed as a bit ""crude"" by some (over-protective) parents, but these jokes will just go right over the heads of the younger kids (just like some jokes in the Shrek movies), so it's really nothing to worry about at all.<br/><br/>I think this is the best Disney animation movie that I've seen probably since Despicable Me, so I would definitely recommend it if you've not seen it yet."
"randreww","10","3","4","22 October 2014"," Enter Coin - Press START!
","I was not ready for the emotions this film stirred in me! And although there's a lot of clich√©s in this film, it never, ever, not once, interferes with the narrative & morale of the story. Let me just say now that the first 30 minutes of this (nice long) film doesn't grab you that much. It's all so surreal & uncanny! Your nostalgia begins to take hold of course! The characters & dialogue are predictable as the games they inhabit. Then a deeper, more introspective undercurrent begins to unfold. It is balanced with the humour & peril perfectly though. <br/><br/>Once you're introduced to the character of Vanellope aka The Glitch, the context of the story starts rebuilding at it's foundations but with twice the importance & you really begin to get sucked in. It's strange. These characters & their lives couldn't be further away from the reality of our own, & by the end of the film you're so emotionally invested in these people that you want to jump in the screen to protect them! <br/><br/>The graphical style throughout this film never ceases to stun you. I've always seen CGI as an intruder to the creative solutions of film making, & it has spoilt a LOT of films for me. But it works in reverse with animated films such as this. There was a life's worth of ideas thrown in to the design concepts of this picture, and it exhibits great restraint at the nascent stages of the film in order to accelerate them. There is no way you will be able to acknowledge all the details of this film in one sitting. So it's longevity is secured. <br/><br/>The voice acting is OTT of course, but connects to the visuals in fundamental ways. I have to hand it to the actors who not only brought these characters to life, but made them so vivid & lovable. <br/><br/>To many, this film will be just another cartoon equivalent; an afternoon's entertainment; or a good laugh for the kids. But to people like myself, it means so much more. When you're a child, you are not equipped with enough answers to build confidence. Some use ego instead to fake the real thing. But many have their confidence destroyed at this vulnerable stage. When I was a child, I had no friends for a long time. It was something I could never deal with. But video games helped me build a fantasy away from reality. My friends were Pacman, Mario, Zelda, Samus, etc. The point I am making is that anyone who ever grew up with video games will never have anything but love & gratitude for them. I feel sorry for those who were purloined of this privilege. I feel a kind of affinity to these characters, because they are the building blocks to my childhood. Not an ideal one maybe. But this film really hit home by the last half hour, & I found myself weeping for their cause. You feel their struggles, as all your own come flooding back. <br/><br/>The bugs destroying the world underground felt like the equivalent of the situation I was in when my parents were arguing night after night after school; the deep contrasts of a young boy trying to have fun to salvage another day of bullying & inferiority. Children also wish to be surrounded by candy & sweets, & yet they somehow know it's all cosmetic. And finally, we know that feeling of being trapped like Vanellope - the odd one out. <br/><br/>Growing up is seeing these fantasies in you die slowly. This is what gives nostalgia both it's irrationality & tragedy. It's like reality is still bleak, but you can't retreat back in to your fantasy anymore. You simply have the memory of that safe place. Vanellope is the one instance where she gets her memories back AND gets to go back to her fantasy. This is a fairy tale of the modern era. And it has a happy ending I still pray for to this very day. It's so absurd that I am here crying for fictional characters that don't even exist, because of society's failure to put the more quintessential human qualities before his fear bread desires.<br/><br/>I may be on my own as usual in this statement as to this film's frivolity & mundane entertainment value. But I rather suspect that this film shall mean so much more to some people who dare to let it take a look back at your own video game. <br/><br/>Every game gets it's plug pulled in the end. Better to win one race than none."
"wge1954","10","3","4","18 September 2014"," More complex than you would expect
","So many Wreck-It Ralph reviews include references to gaming, but, since I don't play video games, this one will not. It will just talk about the movie. <br/><br/>The story line is actually very complex, not what one would expect from a cartoon. In fact, I think parents might want to view it before allowing children to see it because it addresses sensitive issues such as bigotry, peer cruelty and societal exclusion. A family member, who is a parent, I am not, assured me that even small children can cope with these issues. Maybe. <br/><br/>Emotionally, I would compare this film to Picnic, Tell Me That You Love Me Junie Moon and The Sterile Cuckoo. Seriously. Vanellope is an adorable but fragile and tragic little figure. Alone and treated as a pariah, because of a physical disability, she longs to be accepted and included. Her life parallels that of the main character, Ralph, also an exiled refuge from a world that surrounds him and that he wants to be a part of, but is denied.<br/><br/>All that being said, I LOVE THIS FILM. The characters are real, the dialogue genuine, and it has fast-paced action. It has great humor,as when Vanellope first meets Ralph, and tear-jerking sadness, as when Ralph thinks he is protecting Vanellope from self-destruction. There is a background story between Felix and Calhoun that adds more humanity to the film. Close your eyes and you would not know it is a cartoon.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is pure entertainment. Watch it and be delighted."
"eddiez61","9","3","4","12 July 2014"," A Visual Feast with a Generous Helping of Clever Wit and a Big Scoop of Genuine Heart
","The visual splendor alone of every scene, of every frame, elevates this modest but heartfelt film to classic status, but it's the inspired storytelling which truly distinguishes this tribute to those innocent days at the very dawn of our video game saturated culture. Easily one of the most clever, entertaining and satisfying children's computer animated films I've ever seen, up there with the Toy Story trilogy, Wall-E, the Incredibles, and Finding Nemo. <br/><br/>Like Toy Story and Wall-E, Wreck-It Ralph relies on a very potent mix of bittersweet nostalgia for a bygone age and an acid sharp cynicism for an increasingly uncomfortable future. The result is an endlessly endearing cautionary tale warning us to be wary of the myriad increasingly complex and seductive technological innovations which are threatening to overwhelm us with their irresistible electronic magic. That's a dicey position for a computer generated film to take and it acknowledges its own potential hypocrisy with some very astute and hilarious self deprecating humor. <br/><br/>The movie is also saved from descending into self parody on the strength of the very fine performances of its leads. John C. Reilly's naturally affable manner imbues Ralph with a nuanced blend of restrained self pity and emphatic hopeful pride, enriching his character with genuine humanity. And Sarah Silverman is a shear delight as the quick witted pixie faerie who blithely coaxes and goads Ralph to fulfill his destiny as savior of their realm. <br/><br/>Pixar's Toy Story is the original classic computer animated film and rightfully lays claim to the title as Champion of the form, and Pixar's Wall-E certainly upped the stakes with its positively mature and sophisticated theme of catastrophic environmental abuse by an increasingly contented and oblivious populace, but Disney's Wreck-It Ralph achieves greatness by virtue of its unbounded love for its subject and the infectious joy with which it's brought to life. Effervescent glee bursts from every detail. Wreck-It Ralph cheerfully destroys all resistance on its whimsical mission of mass appeal."
"metalman50","10","3","4","20 February 2014"," A Masterpiece!! And, in my eyes, the Best Disney Movie EVER,¬Öby far!
","Wreck-It Ralph is truly a masterful movie in history. There's absolutely no way it could be horrible. In fact Wreck-It Ralph is the only video game based movie to actually be a ""good"" one. Other video game based movies (like Super Mario Bros. and Alone in the Dark) are just BAD (Tron and it's remake were just decent). At first it seemed like kind of a joke (cause we all know video game movies SUCK), then when I saw it,¬Öit blew my mind!<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph arguably has one of the best story lines in overall history (but I'll get into that a little later), with an incredible and downright funny script and amazing characters. The four main characters were outstanding and completely interesting, even their actors, John C. Reilly, as Wreck-It Ralph; Sarah Silverman, as Vanellope Von Schweetz; Jack McBrayer, as Fix-It Felix; and Jane Lynch, as Sgt. Calhoun. Ralph and Felix were extremely hilarious and had some of the most interesting quotes and lines in the entire movie, if some get cheesy after listening to them a lot. Vanellope was really cute and had quite an attitude for a 9-year old (sometimes being more like an adult or teenager than an actual kid what with her acting and IQ). And Sgt. Calhoun was tough in attitude, but a really charming character in my eyes. Even all of the voice actors were suited perfectly for each and every character, and some of the most notable ones that video gamers might notice from video games, like Sonic the Hedgehog's Roger Craig Smith. And some of the coolest cameos in gaming history, like Street Fighter's Ken, M. Bison, Zangief, and Ryu; Pac-Man & the ghosts; Mortal Kombat's Kano (known as Cyborg in this movie), and even Bowser (yeah, Mario was just TOO expensive¬Öplus the creators just couldn't find anywhere to put Mario into the story, so instead his is just mentioned by Fix-It Felix, as well as Ralph mentioning Lara Croft).<br/><br/>The one noticeable thing about the movie's graphics is that it's like combining the colorful environment of Toy Story 3 and the concepts of other video games in gaming like Fix-It Felix Jr. being based off the 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong (Felix can clearly be the Disney version of Mario while Ralph can play a Disney version of Donkey Kong; he's also inspired by other huge VG characters, like Mario arch nemesis Bowser), the first-person shooter genre for Hero's Duty, that also has concept and aspects very similar to the video game franchise Metroid, Sugar Rush's concept is like a cooler and really colorful landscaping of the board game Candy Land, and some other levels involving junk food you'd see in some video games. Though graphics get better and better every single year in computer animation, it's full of amazing detail and color, aside from top-notch animation, and it's one of the best graphical computer animated films, overall (if not as of today).<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph's music is fantastic and I happily have to say it's not only my personal favorite, but one of the best ever Disney soundtracks (if not THE best). Songs like ""When Can I See You Again?"" (Owl City), ""Sugar Rush"" (AKB48), and even ""Wreck-It, Wreck-It Ralph"" (Bunker & Garcia) are some of the most memorable creations in music history (And Hero's Duty has an awesome Skrillex song; plus, it's the only I actually song I actually ""Like"" out of Skrillex), and the soundtrack is, once again, one of the best ever in the history of Disney. Sound effects in the game are suitable for everything in the environment of the movie, even the similar and most notable ones that Disney fans will ever notice entirely, like the ones Ralph finds in the box in a closet in the arcade game Tapper's. When it comes to voice acting, Wreck-It Ralph has one of the best ever in animated movie history (That's it).<br/><br/>The story takes place in Litwak's Arcade were Wreck-It Ralph himself starts to get tired of and complains about his job as a bad guy in his game ""Fix-It Felix Jr."". 30 years later he points out and all of his miserable life in his own game at his first ever attendance at the Bad-Anon conference room with most of the other video game bad guys in the arcade (from other cameo arcade games), which is really the Pac-Man ghosts' space in the Pac-Man game, and about that day being the 30th anniversary of his game. Later during the anniversary party in the Nicelanders' building, things go out of control when Ralph accidentally crushes and splatters (or in his case ""wrecks"") the Nicelanders' anniversary cake during an argument with one of the Nicelanders about being treated nicely, since he's been treated like garbage all his life and having a medal for once to prove himself a good guy to them. Ralph must now set out to find his true destiny and prove himself to be a video game hero in the arcade and a good person (at least once) to the Nicelanders of his game, even if he doesn't have a medal with him to prove it.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is an animated production that is all about perfection in filming. Sure, it does have a few flaws to it, but none of these ruin the movie at all. Even since the last Toy Story, as well as The Lion King, it can undeniably be called the best animated film of all time, at least to me. It's just what someone would want in a movie involving video games. If you haven't seen it, you have absolutely NO excuse. You gotta watch it. (And a little POA) Don't rent. BUY it!!"
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","3","4","29 January 2014"," A nostalgic trip through my childhood.
","""I'M GONNA' WRECK IT!"" <br/><br/>I got a chance to see Wreck it Ralph on Sunday and really enjoyed it. It was a walk down memory lane and had me feeling nostalgic on more than one occasion. <br/><br/>The movie really feels authentic and you can tell it was made by people who grew up in arcades in the 80's. It's not necessary to be a gamer to enjoy the movie, but if you've been playing video games for as long as I have, you will catch a bunch of little Easter eggs that really enhance the enjoyment of the movie. <br/><br/>Wreck-It-Ralph tells the story of a video game character named Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, that happens to be the villain in his game. He goes to work everyday and does a great job, but he's tired of always being the bad guy and never getting any recognition. He decides to escape his game and ends up in another game called Sugar Rush, where he meets a young girl named Vanellope, voiced by Sarah Silverman, who also happens to be an outcast. <br/><br/>This is where the movie really settles in. The relationship Ralph and Vanellope form is really heartwarming and Vanellope is a really fun character. Silverman voices her with such infectious exuberance that it's hard to take your eyes off of her. I don't want to give too much away, but the storyline really works and never gets too silly, unlike many animated films. <br/><br/>Wreck-It-Ralph is a beautiful movie with vibrant colors and fun characters. It's also a very clever film and almost needs to be watched twice to catch all the neat little references that literally seem like they are sprinkled throughout the film. Ralph also made me realize how much I really love video games and how much of an impact they've had on my life since I was that 5-year-old kid unwrapping the Nintendo Entertainment System that was sitting under my Christmas tree. <br/><br/>The film is really about embracing who you are. For the longest time, I was afraid to admit that I still played video games. There are certain stereotypes about gamers that continue to persist today. Even though it's gotten much better over the last few years, there are still people that would call us nerds or losers. Those same people probably are playing more video games than I do. Yes, Angry Birds and Words With Friends are still video games. Deal with it. Rant over. <br/><br/>After watching Wreck-It-Ralph, I can honestly say that I'm proud to be a gamer.

","Did you ever see a movie that was so brilliant, so creative and ingenious, that you couldn't seem to find the words to fully describe it? Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's how I feel about 2012's ""Wreck-It-Ralph"", an animated film where the whole family can be entertained. Meet Wreck-It-Ralph, a video game villain who's been doing the same act of destroying things in the same video game, in the same video arcade for the last thirty years. Being lonely and wanting to be a good guy for a change, Ralph decides to go on a quest to another game and the results, while chaotic for everyone in the video world, are a total blast for us. <br/><br/>On his journey, Ralph encounters a variety of hilarious situations and characters, such as the feisty Vanellope, who like Ralph, also desires to be something different in her candy-coated video world. But they must hurry, for they are being chased by the goofy yet real villain, King Candy as well as an ""Aliens"" inspired infestation of bugs that Ralph inadvertently brings with from another game. Luckily, help comes in the form of a tough as nails warrior, Sergant Calhoun, and from Ralph's game, Fix-It-Felix. There are many things that make this movie worth watching: the fact that the filmmakers are able to really capture the look and feel of the video game world with such fine detail and vivid colors, the inclusion of real video game characters as well as ones who were inspired by real ones, awesome music, but above all, in addition to having plenty of comedy, the movie has heart. Even though the characters may be animated video game characters to begin with, there are still moments where emotion hits you hard, such as the scene where Ralph is tricked into helping King Candy destroy Vanellope's car because he thinks he is doing it for her own good. It gets me every time and that's when you know a film has good writing. But a lot of the credit for the film's success needs to go for the actors who do the voices, such as John C. Reilly as Ralph, Sarah Silverman as Vanellope, Jack McBrayer as Fix-It-Felix, Jane Lynch as Calhoun, and Alan Tudyk as King Candy, plus, a whole lot more. To sum it all up, ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" isn't just for kids; it can be for anyone who used to love going to the arcade, for parents who want to take their kids to a movie that's fun but has an important message, or just for anyone who might need a good laugh. Either way, don't miss this one. 10 out of 10."
"Robert_duder","9","3","4","8 March 2013"," Absolutely ridiculously adorable
","I went into Wreck-It Ralph with very high expectations. My friends had all raved about it and the idea of it being loosely based around 80's Arcade games and featured various video game characters had me incredibly excited for it. I will say that the tone of the film was very, very different than what I expected. I think I expected it to be a little darker and a little more adult geared. I wasn't disappointed in it at all, in fact I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the movie was just adorably cute, filled with tons of decent, solid morals and lessons, great animation, terrific voices, and it's simply fun. The actual connection to old school gaming is pretty minimal in the grand scheme of things, though there are certainly a ton of hidden background references that go unnoticed at first glance. The movie is so sugary sweet (pun intended considering where most of the film takes place) that it was just a constant barrage of feel good scenes. I feel like I'm using words that might seem like a back handed compliment and I don't mean to. This is just a fantastic kids movie that adults won't find as much in as some of the other animated films nowadays. But this is the all time perfect family flick. I can't even fathom the amount of times I had a lump in my throat from nearly tearing up in this movie.<br/><br/>As with most great Disney flicks, the voice cast is near perfect. John C. Reilly is completely and utterly perfect as the over-sized, bumbling Ralph. They couldn't have created a better voice than what he provides. Sarah Silverman might annoy me in person but she is absolutely brilliant as the adorable and rambunctious Vanellope. Jack McBrayer is perfect as Fix It Felix. Felix even looks a little like McBrayer. He tones himself down from his usual over the top comedy making him likable and the perfect hero to Reilly's Ralph. I wasn't sure at first about Jane Lynch as Calhoun. I didn't think she fit the character right at first. However, by the end I was completely into her character and forgot she was Jane Lynch and she really won me over. Alan Tudyk (who sounds exactly like the Mad Hatter from Disney's 1950's Alice in Wonerland) is decent as King Candy, our real main villain. His storyline and character is fun if not just a little predictable.<br/><br/>Director Rich Moore is clearly dedicated to animation. He loves his craft and puts his heart and soul into this movie. It is the type of feel good film that you don't get to see often anymore in animation or otherwise. Its funny and cute without any sort of toilet humour and resorting to cheap laughs. Fix-It Felix is a brilliantly realistic 8 Bit Arcade game. I'm surprised that they didn't create the actual game because it would have completely worked. Animated is of a high standard nowadays and Disney manages to prove once again why they are King of animation with this wholly unique throwback cute comedy that everyone will love. 9/10"
"Wendysbrian","10","3","4","21 January 2013"," If you loved Toy Story & Finding Nemo...
","This movie does for arcade games what Toy Story did for toys. DON'T shy away from it just because it's technically ""video game"" related. You do not have to know video games to enjoy it just the same way you didn't have to be an Oceanographer to enjoy Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Sure, gamers will get a laugh or two more than a non-gamers but even still, the video game references are light and it sticks to the very basics lightly referencing only the most popular games like pacman, mario, and sonic. You don't need to know any of these games to get the story at all. All of the MOST important characters are NEW, from games that don't even exist in real life, and thus, are established well in the plot of the movie rather than it being understood that YOU ""knew"" who these characters are.<br/><br/>This is a perfect family movie for little kids, and BIG kids who grew up with games as old as pacman. It's funny, exciting, and touching; pretty deep for a kids movie. The only kids movie I've seen that's deeper than this one is Toy Story 3. If Toy Story 3's depth is a 10, this movie is about a 7 or 8.<br/><br/>I went to see this with my 4 year old nephew and at 27 years of age, I felt the magic of my childhood coming back to me in this charming movie which drew on many of my memories. Go watch it, you'll love it."
"estebangonzalez10","9","3","4","17 January 2013"," Best Animated Film of 2012
","¬®My name's Ralph and I'm a Bad Guy. I'm 9 feet tall. I weigh 643 pounds. Got a little bit of a temper on me.¬®<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is my favorite animated film from 2012. It reminded me a lot of Toy Story, only this time the characters that come to life aren't toys, but video game heroes and villains. The characters are really well developed and everyone who enjoys playing video games will love this movie. Adults will also enjoy it as the film gives us a sense of nostalgia and love for some of the older games. The graphics of the movie are all really cool; especially the scenes that take place in the ¬®Sugar Rush¬® game. The Sugar Rush game has some similarities with Mario Kart and the Wreck-it Ralph game with the original Donkey Kong game. It's really hard not to fall in love with these characters, especially with Ralph and Vanellope who shared a wonderful connection together. I think that it was a plus that the actors' recorded their characters' voices together in the studio because you could really feel the connection between them, unlike in most other animated films. This led to some extremely funny dialogues which were probably mostly improvised. The flow of the movie was much better this way and I really enjoyed it. I hope it wins the Oscar for best animated film because it was much better than the competition. I also loved the short film, Paperman, that was released with this film. A wonderful short story that helped set the nostalgic mood for Wreck-It Ralph. <br/><br/>Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the villain of his arcade game Wreck-it Ralph. His mission in the game is to wreck an apartment complex which Fix-it Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer from 30 Rock) tries to fix, therefore making Felix the hero and beloved character. When the arcade game shuts down at night, these characters come to life inside their games and they can travel to other games inside the arcade through the machine's electrical plug. There is a ¬®Game Central Station¬® where the characters can travel from one game to another and therefore Ralph decides to go to a meeting with other villains from other known video games to express his feelings. He is tired of being the bad guy and wants everyone to like him so he doesn't have to be on his own. In order to become a hero, he decides to enter another game and try to win a medal so he can prove to the rest of the characters that he can be a hero. He suffers an accident inside one of the video games and ends up in Sugar Rush where he meets Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) who happens to be a glitch inside her game. They discover they share a lot of things in common like being an outcast so they become friends and decide to help each other out on their mission to be accepted.<br/><br/>I thought the plot was pretty ingenious and I loved the world that was created by director Rich Moore and his team. Moore is mostly known for directing some Futurama and The Simpsons TV episodes. He made some really memorable characters and I think the improvising between the actors added more funny moments and heart to the film. I really loved this story and the world they created through these video games - some invented and others authentic like Pac Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Zangief from Street Fighter, Bowser from Mario Bros, Q'Bert, Paperboy, and Tapper who all have some cameo appearances that fans will enjoy. I also have to give a lot of credit to Sarah Silverman who did an excellent job with her character. I loved the way she delivered each line and made her character so lovable. I think her performance was the highlight of the movie. The chemistry with John C. Reilly was incredible as they shared a lot of lines together. I also thought McBrayer was really good voicing Felix, and Jane Lynch the same with Calhoun, the general from another video game called Hero's Duty. Overall I have to say I really loved this movie and found it entertaining. I absolutely recommend it.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","This was a terrific movie. It was about time they did a movie about video game characters-and computer animated was the way to do it! Wreck It Ralph is the villain in a video game, and his dream in life is to be a hero. (or at least a good guy) They say that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and he admire the way everyone looks up to the ""good guy"" in his game. He crashes a party for the good guy but winds up making a mess of things. Ralph then comes up with a plan:he will become a hero by sneaking into another game and winning a medal in that game. Of course, his plan goes awry, and he winds up learning that you don't need to win a medal to be hero in someone's eyes.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved this movie. It features cameos from some of my all-time favorite video game characters like Pac-Man, QBert, Sonic, and their respective villains. I also like the mention of some other classic games like Frogger, Centipede and Asteroids. I also loved the ""group therapy"" scenes with the villains, the character of Wreck It Ralph, his game, other characters, the ""new games"", and the action scenes. This was very delightful John C. Reilly was the perfect choice in the lead. I grew up in the ""video game craze"" of the early 80s and knew all about the games, so I was able to catch some of the stuff. Let me know if you need any explanations, especially of some of the games I talked about. QBert was a great game. This was a great movie and perfect for the entire family! **** out of ****"
"maarvarq-1","10","3","4","12 January 2013"," My smile muscles hurt by the end
","Although I'd seen many positive reviews of this movie, I went in without great expectations as I've never been much of a video game player, and hence didn't expect to get many of the references, but what I got was a brilliantly funny story that still managed to whack me between the eyes with the darker moments. My smile muscles hurt by the end, and I can't say that of a lot of movies. Kudos to all the main voice cast (I did not recognise Alan Tudyk at all), and to the animators, if only for the way they managed to capture in Sgt Calhoun not only Jane Lynch's likeness but also her trademark tough sexiness.<br/><br/>Also, the short feature (Pixar is apparently infecting Disney, which can only be good) is an entirely wordless sweet little story, and of course you should stay for the end-credit Easter Eggs, and the insanely boppy songs."
"griffolyon12","10","3","4","10 January 2013"," Go Now and See, ""Wreck-It Ralph""
","Disney's latest animated film, Wreck-It Ralph, is a charming film that is laugh-out loud hilarious, and yet tender-hearted at the same time. Ralph is a video game bad guy for a video game called Fix It Felix, Jr., a game similar to the original Donkey Kong with Mario and DK. All Ralph wants to do is be seen as a good guy and be liked, so he sets off on a journey traveling through other arcade games to win a gold medal, proving he's a hero. Ralph finds an unlikely sidekick in a glitchy little girl named Vanellope in a Mario Kart-like kart racer who just wants to be a race car driver, and the two team together to try and achieve their individual goals.<br/><br/>It's been said about this film already, but it feels like a Pixar movie rather than a movie from Disney's in-house studios. Not only is the film just wildly original and different than most other animated films in the market, but folks at Disney also created all of these arcade games that seem as if they should be real. Adding to the Pixar comparisons, the filmmakers also crafted some extremely lovable characters, from Ralph to Vanellope to the big bad guy, named King Candy, while infusing the film with deeper themes than most prior Disney animated films deal with. Wreck-It Ralph is all about learning to be comfortable with who you are and not letting a label define you, which is an important lesson for kids, and it's told in such a hilarious way with so many inside jokes about video games that anyone who even has a passing knowledge of video games will find funny, with cameo appearances from the likes of Pac Man and Sonic the Hedgehog.<br/><br/>In all honesty, so much of this film's success must be attributed to Pixar co-founder, John Lasseter, as the new head of Disney Animation, but give credit also to Futurama creator, Rich Moore, who directed Wreck-It Ralph. With Moore's vast imagination, and folks like Lasseter willing to try something different and let talents like Rich Moore simply do what they love, it produces films like these, which is the best film to come from Disney's in-house animation studio in over a decade. The animation is beautiful, the story is both funny and touching, and the voice-over work is superb, with immense kudos to Sarah Silverman for playing the spunkiest little girl on Earth as Vanellope, I mean, who knew she could sound like an 8-year-old kid? On a final note, the animated short that plays before the film, Paperman, is so good it is almost worth the price of admission itself for its sweet love story and for the amazing combination of hand-drawn animation and computer technology that brought it to life. I truly feel that this short shows the true future of animation, combing old school techniques with modern innovations to make a better, higher quality product that still has that personal touch that only hand-drawn animation can give, while creating a depth of the image that you can really only get through using computers.<br/><br/>I give Wreck-It Ralph a 10 out of 10!"
"AvidClimber","9","3","4","8 January 2013"," Wreck-It Ralph ‚Äî Video games have a life of their own, you know
","Wreck-It Ralph was a movie that I was anticipating because I loved the idea behind it. That's usually a bad sign. Too much anticipation can ruin an experience. To my great joy, it wasn't the case. The movie delivered what the preview promised, except for one thing, you spend a greater part of the movie in a single video game world.<br/><br/>The animation is excellent, the story interesting, the basic idea pretty novel, and the characters lovable. They were even able to insert a pretty dramatic and heart wrenching scene as well as a hero finish. You can't ask for much else.<br/><br/>It's an all around excellent animation film, and if you're even slightly interested in video games, especially those old 8-bits ones as well as how it all evolved and the different types of games, you'll be in heaven.<br/><br/>Go see it on the big screen."
"DICK STEEL","10","3","4","21 December 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Wreck-It Ralph
","Think of this film as the electronic gamer geek's equivalent of Pixar's Toy Story, where the characters in the games come alive in their respective consoles when all the humans in the arcade had gone for the day, Traversing one another's world through electronic means such as cables, switches and control stations, those of us who had grown up in the 80s and 90s will find this a nostalgic wet dream come true, with countless of easter egg style appearances of famous games we had once played growing up, peppered with characters whom we had once upon a time commandeered through countless of adventures against the on board computer's AI, defeating scores of enemies that usually don't possess too much intelligence, bring programmed to be repetitive, or at best increasing its speed and response in order to force us into conceding the token used to activate the game.<br/><br/>Ah, those were the days, which were vividly relived in how Wreck-It Ralph took time and effort in capturing those 8-bit gaming heydays. The story centers around the titular Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the default villain in the Fix It Felix Jr. game, where he wrecks a condominium because its developers had unceremoniously booted him out of his favoured slack spot, only for the hero Felix (Jack McBrayer) to come along, repair the damage with his magic hammer, and boot Ralph from the rooftop. You can imagine if these characters are real, just how dead end the job is, especially when accolades go to the hero, while you the villain remain forgotten, or largely ignored, just because well, you're the bad guy. Ralph has done this for 30 years, and in his rare appearance in the Villains' Annonymous meeting chaired in Pac-World, he confides his desire to be admired and appreciated instead, only to be earnestly advised by the likes of Street Fighter's Zangief (director Rich Moore himself) and Zombie (Raymond S. Persi), that what matters is what's inside, not labels.<br/><br/>And truly that's the simple message that goes out to the audience of various ages, the older ones here to witness Toy Story in an electronic environment, while the younger ones undoubtedly charmed by the colours and designs that resemble one big arcade game that comes with different default built-in games for the variety on display, be it the violent first person shooters in outer space, a saccharine sweet car racing game with all female competitors, or the good old 8-bit styled games where the characters' motion isn't that smooth, to reflect the lack of refinement and limited technology in games that we grew up with. The story is surprisingly very much layered, with multiple easy to follow sub-plots that deals with Ralph's search for acceptance, his acquaintance with Vanellope (Sarah Silverman), an outcast like himself for her being the glitch in her world, and his friendship with Felix, and not forgetting the threatening adversaries that come in the form of a fast-breeding bug, a crazed King Candy (Alan Tudyk) that was more than meets the eye, and from the real world, the danger of having one's game labelled Out-of-Order.<br/><br/>The filmmakers here, with first time feature director Rich Moore at the helm, had built a world complete with the necessary rules befitting of something that exists online. If one's game is Out of Order, then the characters will be forced to abandon it and live as nomads of sorts in electronic limbo, or go out permanently with the game. And mortality is reminded again through Sonic the Hedgehog's announcement that if they were to perish in someone else's game world, they will perish permanently. It may be sombre-sounding, but with Moore having cut his teeth from Futurama and early Simpsons episodes, these are naturally masked with a sense of wit and humour, with a story geared toward an encouraging theme of learning to accept and being oneself, and not doing things to seek the approval of others. And the partnership between Ralph and Vanellope is set to endear, despite them being loggerheads when they first start out. I suppose it helps when one of them is a hulking giant with impossibly huge hands, and the other being the wide-eyed child who defies her world's establishment bent on disallowing her to partake in a race. You can see why they click, being outcasts of their own world, put together in an Us versus Them situation.<br/><br/>The characterization here is primarily what makes this film stand out, and many can identify with Ralph during times of insecurity, or having that yearn to belong and feel accepted. And perhaps this film inspires us a little that despite how we look on the outside, it doesn't really matter so long as we stay true. You'd come to admire the effort to clear rights and put in iconic characters from the days of old computer games, and it's certainly a hoot to imagine them up to something else outside of what they were built or programmed for, with the filmmakers throwing a challenge to everyone in trying to identify the multitude of characters and games they had put in to pay homage to. This alone begs multiple viewings just to roam the corners of the vast landscape painted, to spot something that others may not have already, and call it in.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph has everything, from themes of friendship, romance, action, comedy, mystery, and an incredibly moving ending that makes it a surefire winner. I'm going to stick my neck out and put my vote behind this as the best animated film this year to have come out of the Hollywood machinery, with plenty of heart and soul even if the characters are supposed to be made up on bits and bytes. With a little bit of luck since the environment has been set, perhaps we may even see a sequel or two (hopefully not direct to video) for further adventures of this big friendly giant."
"FilmFanatic03","7","3","4","16 December 2012"," An arcade version of ""Toy Story"" (1995)
","Disney are amazing. Over the past 80 or so years they have brought us endless classics and memorable characters and stories. But when they break away from their traditional fairy tales or from their traditional cel-animation (eg. ""Meet the Robinsons"" (2007) and ""Bold"" (2008)) they aren't as beloved as a Pixar CGI animation is. In my opinion ""Wreck-It Ralph"" follows the patters of the two films mentioned above, so I was hoping that Disney could make a really enjoyable CGI animation solo. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed ""Meet The Robinsons"" and ""Bolt"" but they didn't live up to the likes of ""Aladdin"" (1992, ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989), ""Tarzan"" (1999) etc. However, with ""Wreck-It Ralph"" they have produced one of their best solo CGI animation to date. <br/><br/>This film reminded me of an arcade version of ""Toy Story"" (1995) which is a compliment. It was sheer genius how they translated an arcade gaming world into a film world, and how the arcade gaming characters would occupy themselves after playing hours. Also how the depicted the good and bad characters was really interesting and enjoyable to watch. Disney allows us to feel sympathy for the villain which is interesting, because as it is mentioned in the film, the ""bad guy"" is just a label, it doesn't make them bad people. It's hard to explain without giving any spoilers, but I can say the message of the film is really ironic and clever how they used a traditional message and altered it in a unique way. <br/><br/>The story is decent enough. Bad guy wanting to break out of the mould and be the hero and win a medal for once. But his encounter with Vanellope von Schweetz is really special. Her character is so adorable and is very easy to relate to. It kept you watching because it is a unique film so you didn't know entirely where the film was heading, and it came with many thrills and surprises. <br/><br/>Despite it's interesting and enjoyable characters, I wish they did feature more of Sonic and characters from his universe. I didn't know the majority of the gaming characters so I was really excited when seeing Sonic on the posters, so was a little saddened at the 1% you see of him within the film, but it didn't hinder the enjoyment of the film. Also, despite the story being really unique and enjoyable, I wish they included more arcade gaming worlds. This is just a minuscule criticism. <br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable family film with a fresh story and fun characters."
"kdnor2011","9","3","4","3 December 2012"," The Best Animated Movie of the Year
","Ever since John Lasseter took over as the head of Dinsey's animation department, their CGI films have gotten a lot better. I'd actually consider Bolt and Tangled up there with some of Disney's Best works. And the same goes for Wreck It-Ralph, this is a funny, very exiting and likable movie that it should please everyone, not just gamers, and not just animation fans.<br/><br/>Probably my biggest complaint isn't so much a problem in the movie, it's just a little disappointment as to what it was marketed as. I though Ralph would be going into a lot more games and meet many more classic game characters, but he really only goes into four, one only for a short gag, and the cameos only really appear in the first act. Most of the rest is nitpicking, some of the jokes aren't that funny, the romance between felix and the commander feels a bit forced, and the rest are just so small.<br/><br/>I laughed quite a bit in this movie, going from small chuckles to LOLing. I loved the characters in this movie, the heros were likable and interesting, with some great backstory's and a few good twists along the way for some of them. The villain is funny and has quite the motivation, he is also very good at lying. The animation is fantastic, it seems to change with each game which is appropriate. The action scenes are fun, and the plot is deep without getting confusing. The cameos never take away from the story, and even though I'm not a gamer, I can tell you I enjoyed a lot of these cameos, so if you are a hardcore gamer, you will probably love this movie.<br/><br/>Wreck it Ralph ranks up with some of Disney's best works, and it the best animated movie of the year. It's funny, exiting, has some good dramatic moments, has a great pacing, fun characters, and fantastic animation. There are some nitpicks I have, but that doesn't stop this from being a great movie."
"tomdude0","10","3","4","18 November 2012"," Hilarious and filled with genuine emotion
","I went to the theater with my friend, with the intention of seeing Skyfall. However, upon finding out that all showings of Skyfall had been sold out, and that the next theater we went to wasn't even playing it, we settled on Wreck-It Ralph, since we had both also been wanting to see it. I went in with high expectations, and the film did not disappoint--in fact, in exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>The story, while it seems rather formulaic as a kids' animated movie, is really quite good. The writing is solid and provides the audience with an excellent understanding of just about every character. The film, thankfully, is not predictable and actually kept me guessing towards the end.<br/><br/>The characters themselves are incredibly likable. Ralph isn't exactly the archetype hero, but we are shown that despite his tall height and short temper, he's really a good guy. Fix-It Felix and Calhoun provide some excellent comic relief. Jane Lynch's voice acting is superb. But the real gem of the film is Vanellope, who is probably the most adorable thing I've ever seen. It's simply impossible not to like her.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is as good as it gets. With an amazing cast of characters, bright animation, and a story that's filled with genuine emotion, this movie melted away all my masculinity. I haven't teared up this much at the end of a movie since Toy Story 3. I cannot describe this movie any other way except to say that it is perfect."
"sonicfan5715","10","3","4","12 November 2012"," Animated Brilliance
","At first, I was just excited to see certain characters like Sonic the Hedgehog, interacting in the film and having a big role to play, but this film does not focus on that. It's about Ralph and his journey through this wonderful film. It's been years since I've seen a film with this much imagination and creativity set in this fantastic ""video-game world"" realm that comes to life after the arcade is closed. There wasn't one character that I didn't like or annoy me in any way in this film, Ralph himself is a very lovable and likable character, as well as co-stars Vanellope, Fix-It Felix, Calhoun, and so forth.<br/><br/>The story takes place in this world were there are tons of different video game worlds, but primarily goes through 2 worlds other than Ralphs own game, a first person shooter (name escapes me at the moment), and Sugar Rush (where the majority of the film takes place). The world of Sugar Rush is pretty adorably creative, and makes for quite a few candy puns, best being the devil dogs and the ""ore-o"" spoof of Wizard of Oz. After Ralph makes his decision to win a medal, and does, but winds up losing it in Sugar Rush, we get a wonderful relationship between Vanellope and Ralph, as you discover what both of them feel and going through. Vanellope is very likable, and you really feel for her once you hear her backstory. One scene in particular when Ralph is convinced by King Candy that if she won the race, she'd die, he ""wrecks"" the car the two of them made together, and it really gets to you.<br/><br/>The film takes an emotional arch that you did not expect it to go, being a comedy/video-game inspired film, and provides an unexpected, yet so obvious twist, at the climax that you have to see for yourself. The entire climax and the ending is absolutely amazing, and delivers a very touching message once everything is set right and resolved. I saw Wreck-It-Ralph by myself, and loved every minute of it. This is definitely in my Top 5 Favorite animated movies of all time.<br/><br/>Wreck-It-Ralph (10/10)"
"yeasyoustedog","10","3","4","9 November 2012"," A very refreshing animated film with an imaginative and well implemented concept.
","I will be forthright, I was very aporetic towards the potency of this film when the concept was paraphrased to me. I simply couldn't previse any latent substance in apperceptive video game characters with fatalistic masquerades. However, the opening scene was quite the epiphany from my perspective. The film manages to effectively demonstrate its amenities and capture the interest of the spectator and adamantly refuses to relinquish it throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>After observing the copious appearances of commonplace gaming entities such as, for instance, Pac-man; I had presumed that the film merely referenced them in order to execute a more demographic approach to captivating public interest in the film, however, this inclination was also erroneous. The film provides an evident obeisance to several more obscure characters as well, which I myself found convivial.<br/><br/>The conflict of the film is also very poignant. The plot components are very subtle and gradually evince the juxtaposition between each occurrence to the viewer at applicable times.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend viewing this film. I'm very content in finally viewing an animated film versatile enough for any age group to indulge."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","4","7 November 2012"," Pixar who? 'Ralph' is one of the most creative and witty animated films in years
","For at least a decade now, the first name in animation has been Pixar, with the Disney half of that combination generally omitted. Pixar's dedication to the best storytelling in both written and visual form as well as incredible creativity and cleverness has generally gone unparalleled, but plain old Disney Animation show it's catching up fast with ""Wreck-It Ralph.""<br/><br/>The concept behind ""Wreck-It Ralph"" owes a lot to the ""Toy Story"" movies that started the entire CGI revolution, but the level of complexity and creative world-building required by ""Ralph"" puts ""Toy Story"" in the bargain bin. Creating a world in which video game characters exist in a virtual network of arcade games after the arcade closes takes some serious ingenuity, which not only do director Rich Moore, writers Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston and the entire creative team have in spades, but they keep their foot on the creativity gas pedal the entire time.<br/><br/>Based on the genre's track record, an animated movie overflowing with this much artistic production design would likely fail in some fundamental aspect of the story, but ""Wreck-It Ralph"" wastes no time establishing Ralph as a character you sympathize with. The concept of a video game bad guy who has feelings and gets treated poorly because his job is to be mean fuels the emotional journey of the story from the opening minutes, though credit also to the writing and the voice work of John C. Reilly for making it such a convincing sell.<br/><br/>After throwing Ralph this successful pity party, the film shows off its abundance of imagination and cleverness. As we see ""Game Central Station"" for the first time, essentially a power strip where the characters of every game can mingle, we get most of the film's famous video game character cameos. Because the film is still constructing this elaborate universe, we also get treated to several brilliant moments in which instead of traditional CGI, we will see a clip of the scene as if it were happening on an 8-bit arcade screen.<br/><br/>The genius of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" in this regard simply can't be understated. It's easily the most creative and genuinely hilarious animated film since ""Toy Story 3,"" and if you discount that, then all of recent memory. Gamers will love the countless early references and most adults in general will find the beginning of ""Ralph"" to be the best part. The script clearly takes the strategy of dropping in most of the easter eggs at the front end so it can win audiences over quickly and focus on the core narrative in the later acts. At this point, the humor in the story also shifts to something more geared at kids, though it never stops pumping the creative juices.<br/><br/>Determined to win a medal so he can prove to everyone in his game, ""Fix-It Felix Jr.,"" that he's a true hero, Ralph abandons his post as building-wrecker and searches for a way to prove himself (or just get his hands on a shiny medal). He sneaks into the first-person sci-fi shooter ""Hero's Duty"" and when that plan goes awry, he accidentally ends up in the candy- coated racing game ""Sugar Rush"" and becomes entangled in an entirely new conflict after ""Sugar Rush"" character Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), an outcast in her game, steals his medal.<br/><br/>The plot does get a bit complicated, but the film remains dedicated to its characters throughout and doesn't ever get too lost. Even Ralph goes from a character we pity at first to someone who's rather flawed in how he just wants to be treated like a hero rather than earn it. Naturally, the situation in the world of ""Sugar Rush"" provides the ultimate test for his character. He and Vanellope strike a deal so he can get his medal and so she can win a spot as a starting racer in ""Sugar Rush"" despite being a glitch in the game.<br/><br/>Setting the majority of the later half of the movie in the candy world of ""Sugar Rush,"" the creativity comes in the form of creative junkfood jokes such as donut cops and an abundance of candy puns, as well as Ralph and Vanellope exchanging childish insults. It can get overbearing, but something clever and hilarious lies in wait around every corner to cancel the cheesy stuff out.<br/><br/>The sheer force of this film's vision and inventiveness has the power to mask pretty much any knock you might consider holding against it, and it doesn't substitute creativeness for visual quality either. ""Ralph"" looks excellent, with props to the way that film's retro arcade characters move like 8-bit game characters despite being in CGI.<br/><br/>""Wreck-It Ralph"" doesn't quite have the same degree of heart as Pixar's best offerings, but considering the extremely commercial nature of the concept, the fact that it does pull heartstrings at all is something that will make you think even less of films like ""Cars 2."" Ralph's arrival at self-realization has somewhat of an obvious trajectory, but it's not as clear cut as the moral lessons presented in most animated movies. There are some powerful turns in the emotional narrative that you don't expect from a movie that combines the shooting of deadly alien bugs and little tween-age girls driving edible race cars.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" offers something we just haven't seen (outside of ""Toy Story"") since the dawn of the CGI era: a near-perfect merging of the somewhat mindless and shiny commercial appeal common in lesser family films and the creative and visual brilliance and committed storytelling of the genre's absolute best.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks you for reading!

","As a 30-something father of two I can say that I absolutely loved this movie. This is really what you hope every movie experience will be like when you go to the theater. The homage to my favorite form of media and entertainment, classic video games, was just the frosting on the cake as this movie had real substance. The plot was wonderful, as it contained all the right elements of surprise, anticipation and suspense. The characters were delightful and the movie really drew you in to their plights and made you care about them and their relationships to one another. I haven't seen a movie this well made, animated or not, in a long time (excluding Avengers). This is one I'll be able to watch over and over again and enjoy each time."
"cleanplayer","10","3","4","3 November 2012"," The Best Video game Movie Ever Made
","After seeing the trailer in June, I have been anxiously waiting to see this movie. Well, the hype is legit and Wreck It Ralph is the best animated movie of the year! John C. Reilly plays Ralph, the bad guy of Fix-It-Felix's arcade game, and delivers an outstanding performance. Being a hero is an overplayed storyline in almost all animated movies, but Disney makes Wreck It Ralph fresh and original. I was laughing the entire film and it's charm won me over. As a hardcore gamer, the soundtrack and appearances of various video game characters and references was awesome. It was not only nostalgic, but cool which brought back great memories of going to the arcade and putting quarter after quarter in a machine. Overall, I was blown away by Wreck It Ralph. WHATEVER YOU DO GO SEE IT! And I'll definitely be seeing it again in 3D!"
"CosmoBrown","7","5","9","7 November 2012"," Time for a reality check
","Wreck-It Ralph is a very good movie, which I really enjoyed. I would put it right up there with Tangled and Cars and A Bugs Life.<br/><br/>But it is no Toy Story or Who Framed Roger Rabbit, movies to which it is being mistakenly compared. Those movies were masterpieces. This is far from a masterpiece. It has the good fortune of being released in a year of good but flawed animated movies--The Lorax, Brave, Ice Age 4, Madagascar 3, ParaNorman, Frankenweenie, Hotel Transylvania...this is not a stellar movie slate. Release this movie in 2010 (the year of Toy Story 3, How to Train Your Dragon, Despicable Me and Tangled) and it would barely get noticed.<br/><br/>Ralph's quest to get a medal seems arbitrary and artificial, especially when compared to Woody's quest to get back home. The amount of arbitrary rules in this movie is staggering and evidence of lazy writing. And the movie overall felt derivative--from its plot of a bad guy who turns good (Despicable Me, Megamind) to its characters like King Candy (the Mad Hatter from Alice) and Vanellope (Agnes from Despicable Me), to its twist at the end (Who Framed Roger Rabbit). Don't get me wrong--I really liked this movie, and I think it was the best animated movie of the year. But this year that's not saying much."
"jintanyarou","1","23","62","25 February 2013"," A Fundamentally Flawed and Badly Written Piece of Celluloid
","When my friend and I came out of the cinema having just watched this, neither of us knew where to start to make sense of what we'd just been put through. Both being long-time video game fans, I'd recommended that we go and see it on the strength of the trailer. But beyond the visual references to various games of the past thirty years, there's really nothing here to hold the interest of older gamers like us. There's actually very little to hold the interest of *anyone*, so confused is this mish-mash of seemingly good ideas.<br/><br/>The film starts out well enough, with the Fix-it Felix Jr. game rendered faithfully as though it were a real coin-op from the 80s, and the initial look into Game Central colourful and awe-inspiring. But after Ralph decides to get himself a hero's medal to prove to everyone in the Fix-it Felix game that he's not just a badguy, things take a turn for the worse. The Hero's Duty game environment is that of a generic sci-fi-inspired modern first-person shooter, and feels like it was put in the movie to appease the fans of such games, rather than because it was beneficial to the plot.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Ralph gets his coveted medal, but ends up accidentally activating one of the deadly and voracious robotic bugs from that game, and stumbles into an escape pod that eventually takes him to the kart-racing game known as Sugar Rush. It's here that the plot flits and meanders between so many different plot points that it becomes almost impossible to follow (Ralph wants to get his medal back/Vanellope is a glitch/wants to be a real kart racer but doesn't know how to drive/Ralph isn't in his own game so it's declared out of order and might be taken away/King Candy has his own dastardly plans, as he is actually an embittered game character from years ago whose back story is thrown in at the eleventh hour/As Vanellope is a glitch, she needs to cross the finish line in a race, otherwise she can't leave the game/Bug from Hero's Duty has multiplied exponentially and poses serious threat to Sugar Rush world).<br/><br/>It ends up trying to cover too many characters and needing to tie up too many loose ends. That these are seemingly neatly tied up at the end doesn't vindicate it. Also, the fact that the entire second half of the film is set in the Sugar Rush game is a big weakness. With its retina-searing colours and endless depictions of sweet-like landscapes, it doesn't feel game-like in any way, and it's here that the movie lapses into bog-standard CGI animation territory. I was very interested to learn that the production had been in development hell for so long, as it has the feel of having been cobbled together with bits and pieces from various writers who've come and gone over a long period of time.<br/><br/>But the thing that really struck me was the terrible characters. Ralph and Felix are fairly likable, and their voice actors' respective performances suit the characters perfectly, but the film is ruined entirely by the two main female characters. Sergeant Calhoun has obviously been shoehorned in to provide relief from the ubiquitous and generic male space marine type, but is utterly objectionable. Bitter and sadistic, she freely smashes Ralph and Felix with her helmet/rifle butt/fists multiple times and fires on sight at Felix the first time they meet. There's even a particularly uncomfortable scene where Felix begs her to hit him so that they'll be saved from quicksand by some candy-vines that find the violence funny(???) and her inflicting injuries on him is seen as OK, as he can heal himself with his magic hammer. Honestly, what madman came up with that?! There's an attempt at back story and explaining why she's so callous, but she's devoid of any redeeming qualities, so it all falls flat. There's also a complete mismatch between her face and her voice; she looks like a girl in her twenties, but sounds like a middle-aged woman.<br/><br/>Then there's Vanellope. In the scene in which she first appears, she steals Ralph's medal and uses it for her own ends. Then, after witnessing her getting bullied by her peers, Ralph agrees to help her to get back what she stole from him(!). There's a 'cute' scene where Vanellope makes a replacement medal for him out of sweets, but she never apologises for stealing it in the first place. Yet she makes Ralph repeatedly apologise and demean himself for smashing her kart and stopping her entering the race, even though he did it on the knowledge that it might save her life! These are not the actions of a protagonist. She is irritating, brattish, selfish and entitled, yet when she's feeling depressed or being picked on, the viewer is supposed to feel sorry for her. She deserves nothing, yet ends up with everything, her disability becoming a super-power and the denizens of candy land suddenly remembering that she used to be their princess.<br/><br/>Modern films are full of characters like this, and this particular film left me once again lamenting Hollywood's fundamental inability to come up with characters that the audience cares about. Without such characters, no amount of rainbow-coloured gloss will make any movie anything other than ultimately worthless.<br/><br/>So the movie fails on all counts. Video game fans will inevitably be left disappointed, as beyond the visual cues to games past and present, there's very little to keep them interested. It's too convoluted for younger viewers, and not well written or funny enough for older audiences. What a shame."

","The best American animated film of 2012, I think it's safe to say. Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) plays a video-game villain, a monstrous man who smashes a high-rise apartment every day while Fix-It Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer), the hero, combats him and eventually gets him thrown off the building into a pile of mud. In the game's universe, this is just everyone's job. Ralph is sick of being the bad guy, though, and wants to win acceptance from the people who live in the apartment. The video game characters can leave their consoles and visit the other games, and Ralph decides to become a hero by entering a war game. Unfortunately, the havoc he wreaks there gets him thrown into another game where he wreaks even more havoc. This film is insanely clever, creating several different worlds with their own flavor. It's also just great at setting up plot points and twists without ever showing you its hand. Small bits that seem like only errant gags come back up later in surprising and brilliant ways. The characters are as well constructed as the plot. The two other most important characters are voiced by Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman, as a sci-fi warrior and a pixie racer respectively. Silverman's character in particular is so wonderful, both adorable and annoying. Her character's relationship with Ralph becomes the emotional center of the film, and it packs almost as much of a wallop as Pixar's best works. The film is very much at Pixar's level throughout. It's really one of Disney's best movies, period. Huge congrats to Rich Moore, who follows in fellow-Simpsons veteran Brad Bird's footsteps in delivering a hugely satisfying feature film. Hopefully he'll give us another one really soon."

","Initially through advertisements you are shown clips of lots of nostalgic characters and themes. Ranging from Classic Arcade, NES, SNES, GENESIS and more. I'm into all of this stuff you think to yourself. I must enjoy this film. Let me help you understand what this movie is and isn't.<br/><br/>This movie has a great 10-20min starting. Lots of classic characters, originality and some humour. If this movie were just a short of the first 20minutes then I would give it a solid 9/10.<br/><br/>However after The starting 10-20min your put into a universe that feels like every other sub-par CGI animated film released in the last 6 years. Megamind, Happy Feet Two, Bolt.<br/><br/>The movie devolves into an experience where you could care less about the movie or what is going on. Mind numbing action that has no real meaning or emotion behind it. Just a bunch of explosions and screams. You don't care about the characters and your just waiting for the movie to end.<br/><br/>It's as if they made an abomination of a movie then realized how horrible it was and purchased rights from many IP's (Capcom, Konami) for the sole purpose of throwing into their trailers and advertisements but have nothing to do with the story line or past the 20 minute mark.<br/><br/>It was clear that after the 20 minutes no one laughed at the poorly written script and no body was drawn into it. Looking around I just see people looking at their watches/phones waiting for the movie to end.<br/><br/>This movie has to be the biggest bait and switch I've witnessed in my movie watching days."

","""I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way."" - Jessica Rabbit <br/><br/>""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a dull and unimaginative animated comedy by Walt Disney Studios. The film finds John C. Reilly voicing Ralph, a muscular character trapped in a computer game's villain's role. Desiring to be a hero, Ralph embarks on a quest to find a silver medallion, a quest which sees him both battling an evil video game overlord and helping a young computer programme who exists as an unwanted glitch.<br/><br/>""Wreck-It Ralph"" hit theatres the same week that Disney sealed the deal to acquire LucasFilm and its Star Wars franchise (it absorbed Pixar and chunks of Marvel as well), moves which are indicative of the company's love affair with recognisable brands. ""Wreck It Ralph"" is itself a giant game of spot-the-brand. Like ""Toy Story"", which bought the licenses of numerous classic toys for the purpose of populating its virtual world (and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" before it), ""Ralph"" is packed with both authorised video game crossovers and nods to modern and old-school computer games. There are allusions to 8-bit games of the 1980s, the sprites of the 1990s and the more ""advanced"" first person shooters of today. Pac Man makes an appearance, the cast of Street Fighter, Ralph is modelled on Donkey Kong, one game world resembles the conflicts between StarCraft's Space Marines and Zerg, and an extended set piece plays like Mario Kart on glucose.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film is witless, totally unfunny, none of its homages are particularly clever, its visuals look drab next to other recent Disney animated features (""Tangled"", ""Bolt""), its big car chase sequence feels like a low rent version of ""Cars"", or even ""Phantom Menace's"" pod-race on a budget, and the film's virtual computer worlds are all unimaginative. One virtual world, called Sugar Rush and populated by Bratz doll lookalikes, resembles a cross between Diet Coke and My Little Pony equestrian vomit, only more epileptic. Bizarrely, the film urges ostracised folk to suck it up and win the favour of bullies in order to earn inclusion. Nice.<br/><br/>4/10 ‚Äì Better recent big studio animations? ""Tangled"", ""Megamind"" and ""The Secret World of Arrietty"". More interesting international fare? ""Persepolis"", the works of Sylvain Chomet, Yuriy Norshteyn, Mamouru Oshii, Satoshi Kon, Isao Takahata and of course Miyazaki."
"rakiani","3","11","29","3 March 2013"," Standard affair
","All the creativity and characters you want to see are at the beginning of the movie. Then your left in an unrecognizable world featuring a Mad Hatter rip-off and the standard annoying comedy side-kick for the vast majority of the film. Ralph himself is a good character and John C. Reilly does a great job, it's just a shame he ends up stuck in a dull world/game for most of the movie.<br/><br/>I think the most disappointing part for me was that all those loved characters you see in the trailer and cover art have literally no part to play. I think that the trailer might just about show most of their screen-time. They are simply used for a few quick gags before disappearing. The review is purely my opinion but this is a simple fact unfortunately. It seemed to be enough for most people to get excited about though.<br/><br/>I believe this was an opportunity sorely missed because of how versatile and in-depth the retro characters are. They also look far more interesting from a design stand point. The two 'game worlds' you enter are filled with homogenized characters and lands that you could find in any modern animation. Apart from Calhoun these characters aren't well fleshed out or interesting in anyway.<br/><br/>Overall apart form the start of the movie, which I did enjoy, the rest descends into something closer to a Madagascar or Ice Age experience. Rather than something original and creative like The Incredibles or WALL-E. A standard affair and an opportunity missed in my eyes."
"zarajasmin1586","2","15","43","6 March 2013"," What's with the fuss?
","I honestly don't understand why everyone's raving about this movie. For me, the biggest drawback and constant grater on my nerves are the absolutely annoying characters, beginning with the titular character himself to the most unmemorable villain.<br/><br/>Let's start with Ralph. I get that he's being treated like garbage and he wants to get more out of his existence despite everyone around him telling him he should stick to the status quo. That's nothing new (and nowhere even close to the ballpark of original). But did he have to be such a selfish, self-serving jerk about it? He stormed into Hero's Duty, almost revealed the big secret (that video game characters have lives outside of the arcade's opening hours), stole the medal, released the evil little bug thingies, destroyed property.... the list goes on. And all without even a hint of regret or contrition, an ounce of self-awareness, and the slightest regard that he was jeopardising every other characters' livelihoods (and lives) JUST so he can serve his own selfish, deluded desire to get a medal. That's like saying, ""Hey kids, it's okay to cause trouble to everyone because you're just trying to get what you want and there's nothing wrong with that."" <br/><br/>It's just so...American.<br/><br/>And Vanellope! She's spoiled, selfish, and annoying as well. It's like they all have tunnel vision or something. It's all about 'me, me, me. It's what I want and it's what I'm going to get'. Case in point, she totally took that medal even though Ralph begged for it and practically sobbed out how much it meant to him. And she threw it into a freaking cauldron, fully knowing that it would disintegrate (doesn't matter that the medal's going to reappear IF she wins the race). I just...<br/><br/>It's like every action the characters do cause stress to me. Felix is a spineless fool. Calhoun was promising in the beginning but her backstory was more like a parody than something that was supposed to give her dimensions. King Candy was like that raisin-filled chocolate that nobody likes but is somehow always in the box. He's uncanny and out of place (even though we all discover the reason for that later).<br/><br/>The graphics were great, though. The inclusion of all the game characters was interesting. It gets a little off-putting with all the obvious product placements but it gives the viewers a nice opportunity to relate to some of the things shown.<br/><br/>But the clich√©d plot and the characters that absolutely grated on your nerves are the dealbreakers. I couldn't even sit through until the end. Left the theatre an hour into the movie. And I thought Brave was bad."
"shannonjefferies","7","4","8","7 January 2016"," Wrong Lesson
","Let me start by saying that this is a wonderfully entertaining film packed full of action, humor and heart. However the best kids movies not only entertain but teach some kind of lesson as well. At the beginning of the film Ralph is misunderstood and mistreated by everyone. His ""job"" is to be the bad guy and he's treated as such even though he's actually a nice guy who's been assigned a crummy position. So you'd think that by the end of the film everyone will realize what jerks they've been and that the real villains are themselves. The lesson - look beneath the surface and treat people how they deserve to be treated not just the way you think they should be treated. Wrong!!! There's only one very brief scene where Felix realizes how unfair he's been to Ralph, and that's as close as this movie comes to getting the right message across. In the end things improve for Ralph and the others give him the respect he deserves, but they do it for all the wrong reasons. Instead of celebrating him for being the great guy he's been all along, Ralph saves the day and proves himself to be a hero. So I guess the lesson here is if you want people to invite you to parties and bake you a cake, save them from mass destruction. Otherwise you can go live on a pile of garbage and be alone."

He is disliked and disrespected by all the characters in the game, ignored by them during their 30th Anniversary and lives in a dumb. He seeks more from his life and wants to be a hero, so jumps out his game to seek a medal. But his actions could result to dire consequence for his game and Game Central Station as whole.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is a delightful animated film for children and the children inside all of us. It has all you would want in a Disney film, comedy, drama, action and most importantly heart-felt moments. As you except the animation is excellent, whether it's in the world of Fix- It Felix, the brightly coloured Sugar Rush and the dark alien world which parodies of Halo and Aliens. <br/><br/>Disney find a great voice cast for the film. Reilly is a great actor who was had great comic timing with excellent lines he is given and Sarah Silverman plays to her strengths as the hyper-active, annoying Vanellope von Schweetz. Alan Tudyk was strong as the villain, King Candy, a cross between the Mad Hatter, Humpy Dumpy and Willy Wonka and was similar to Lots-O-Huggin' Bear in Toy Story 3. The animators even thrown in a fun reference to the Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>The script by Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee (who went on to make Frozen) is top notch. It follows typical formula that a character thinks he needs a medal to prove he is a hero when it's his actions that count, that both Ralph and Vanellope are both outsiders in their games and that they want to prove themselves, longing for more. But it does the formula well and it tires all its story lines effectively. The characters are well rounded, there is plenty of and pacing was perfect, showing Disney is on top form.<br/><br/>Gamers will also get plenty references and Easter Eggs and many classics game gamers make an appearance in some form. Gamers young and old will enjoy this film."

Ralph abandons his game to go earn a medal and heads over to a modern game called Hero's Duty. In an attempt to win the medal, he ends up in a super sweet racing game called Sugar Rush, where his medal is stolen by an adorable little outcast named Vanellope Von Shweetz (Sarah Silverman). I think when Rich Moore (director) started working on this film he wanted to incorporate the typical Disney theme of a hero and a damsel, but also wanted to make something fresh. From the marketing point of view, this movie is extremely crafty. Moore does a fantastic job of mixing the retro and modern cultures, doing so opens the film to a larger and more diverse audience. I think the adults wanted to see Wreck It Ralph just as much as the kids did! As an aspiring animator, I go and see almost every animated children's film, and Wreck It Ralph is the by far the best I have seen in a long time. I also love this film because it strays from the typical ""prince marries the princess"" bit that Disney has been using since the dawn of time. I would recommend this film to anyone because the bond that is formed between Ralph and Vanellope is one you won't want to miss."

","Much like ""The Princess and the Frog"" and ""Tangled,"" I was not expecting to like this film when it came out simply because it was Disney. After I accidentally watched it with some friends and acquaintances, however, I was blown away by it! This film is so greatly impressive, smart, creative, and just fantastic! I don't think it's one of my favorite films, but that doesn't mean it's not a great one!<br/><br/>ANIMATION: If you read my review of ""Tangled,"" you'll remember I said the animation in that movie was good, but I'm not a huge fan of CG animation from the Walt Disney Animation Studios. This movie makes me a fan of it! It is beautiful! It's bright, it's colorful, and it actually makes me forget I'm looking at computer animation; it just looks like Disney. My favorite part of the animation is the contrast of the characters. Watching Sgt. Calhoun, a character who is designed so dark in color, walk in a world that is brightly colored and happy-looking, is great! That type of artistic work and creativity is represented throughout this film!<br/><br/>SONGS/MUSIC: There are no songs.<br/><br/>ROMANCE: It is a lot of fun watching Fix-It Felix, Jr. and Sgt. Calhoun together! They're funny, they're adorable, and they're so sweet together. Part of what makes the romance work, and funny, is that Felix and Calhoun are two totally different people. Calhoun is dark (not just in color and design, but her personality and back story too), cynical, and tough; and Felix is happy, joyous, and excited. Much like Belle and Beast, you wouldn't expect these people to fall in love with each other. Yet they're the perfect couple!<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: These are some really good characters. They're great; after having characters who were underwhelming in ""Tangled,"" it's nice to see these characters who are interesting and engaging. Ralph's actions may come from selfish ambitions, but we can relate to him; we can understand how and why he would leave his game. King Candy is a great villain! He may be the first Disney villain I've seen whose evilness wasn't obvious when we first saw him. His villainy character wasn't clear until later in the movie. When his true nature finally was revealed, I was hooked; he is a great character. There's only one character I don't care for, and that's Vanellope. When she was introduced, she was rude, mean, and unlikeable. I do not like the scene where the other children destroy her race car; not because of how cruel they are, but because the movie is trying to get me to feel sorry for Vanellope. If the film wanted me to like her, it should have introduced her in a likable way.<br/><br/>STORY: This story is fantastic! It's unique, it's interesting from beginning to end, and it has plot twists that I couldn't see coming. When the reveal of who King Candy really is took place, my jaw dropped! Maybe other people saw what was coming, but I certainly didn't. I like that the story has, not only a unique plot, but also a unique moral, at least for Disney. Of course, the ""stay true to who you are"" lesson is nothing new to Disney, but Ralph, who us the bad guy in his game, has to stay content with who he is. What with this coming from Disney, I'd expect the film to try and force him to change from a bad guy to a good guy. Of course he has a story arc and he changes by the end of the movie, but he's content with who he is and what his role is in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: This is a great movie! It's unique, it's smart, it's stylized, and it's fun! I'm so glad that I was wrong about this film. I look forward to seeing it again in the future. This come from someone who isn't necessarily a fan of video games. If you like video games, you'll love this film. Even if you don't like video games much, there are still elements here that I think will engage you. Check it out and see what you think. God bless you. BOOYIKA!"
"smilefumble","8","2","3","15 June 2014"," A ""modern"" Disney classic
","That's what director Rich Moore said he wanted to create when he was assigned to direct Wreck it Ralph: ""a film that is like the classic Disney movies, but takes a hit off of something more modern and contemporary."" Watching this film, I can see without a doubt that he did just that! <br/><br/>The story takes place in an arcade (don't think I've ever seen one of those in a Disney film before) where the characters of each game have their own individual lives after the arcade closes. Enter Ralph: a hulk- sized hobo who as the villain of his game, has to smash apartments every day so that his hero counterpart, Felix can repair them and is shunned and by the game's denizens as a result. <br/><br/>Wanting something better in life, Ralph proceeds to find another video game (the characters can travel to other consoles via the cords and power strips connecting them) where he can win a medal, just like always Felix does, so he can be hailed as a hero for once. He eventually finds one, but through a series of misadventures, ends up in a candy-themed racing game where he meets Vanellope: an impish street urchin who, as it turns out, needs the medal as much as Ralph does because, due to her tendency to glitch now and again, is an outcast herself. <br/><br/>So, as you can tell, this film has all the elements you'd expect a classic Disney film to have; yet takes place in a modern day world. <br/><br/>The worlds that they created for this movie blew me away; you could tell that the animators pulled out all the stops with this one! In Ralph's game a classic, retro, 8-bit one everything, including the characters' bodies are square and the backgrounds are almost non-existent. In Vanellope's game, called Sugar Rush, little candy-themed touches that really stand out, such as the grandstands being candy boxes and Vanellope's bed being a sponge cake are everywhere. <br/><br/>The characters are pretty good too, if a little stock. We've seen the story of ""misfit meets another misfit"" in lots of other films (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, anyone?) However, Ralph and Vanellope are just so innocent and so willing to go the distance for their dreams, you can't help but like them. Felix is very likable too, as he will always do what is required of him without complaint. Heck, he goes as far as to let himself get punched in the face because it will eventually lead to him finding Ralph; you've got to admire someone like that! <br/><br/>If I did have a complaint with this movie, it would be that the way the characters and/or objects thrive in their video game environments raises a few questions. The movie establishes that if a game is unplugged the characters within it die, yet what if there is a power outage at the arcade, do they not regenerate if the power comes back?<br/><br/>However, that aside, I think that Wreck it Ralph will be enjoyed for many a generation to come, just like the rest of the classic Disney movies because it's right up there with them!"
"starlimitz2","10","2","3","13 May 2014"," Gamer Warning: Mind could be Blown
","A delightful film of cgi bliss! Wreck-it Ralph has some of the most dazzling displays of bright colors as well as dark, sinister gloom that creates a wonderful spectrum of eye-candy for the whole family. I do mean the whole family, too. Not only does it have many clear nods to current games on the market, but it also has some of the retro cameos that many adults will be able to relate to. The characters are very three-dimensional (in several ways) and the setting is clever, even creative in their design. You find yourself choosing your favorite characters on the spot, and even caring for them even before you get to know them better.<br/><br/>Though the creators did miss a golden opportunity, while the story line is enticing, they could have had Ralph visit many other video game worlds, even if they weren't real games, it would have been more fun to see his reaction to some other types of games. Still, it was clear that those sorts of things may have interfered with the broad spectrum of the film itself. This movie has several potentials for gigantic sequels, and I'm even curious enough to actually play the video game itself, even though I haven't confirmed that they made one, I think it's obvious. This is a movie to catch in the theaters, as fast as your legs can carry you."
"atlasmb","10","2","3","4 May 2014"," Animation At Its Best!
","This is an animated film about game animation. It references everything from ""The Matrix"" to ""Pong"" to Japanese anime. It is one of the most imaginative films I have ever seen. Couple that with the fact that it features some great voice talents and amazing art work, and it is great viewing for anyone who appreciates gaming or animation.<br/><br/>You know you are seeing great animation when the story covers all the emotional bases, including tearjerker scenes. How much talent does it take to get the viewer to invest in the relationships between cartoon characters so much that they are moved to tears? This is a great story that rivals any Pixar production, especially since it incorporates the stylings of each (real life) game it mimics.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of the game is Sarah Silverman's portrayal of Vanellope. I have read some other viewers' comments about not liking her voice, but she is delightful, especially since the animators used her expressions for the character as well. They did the same with Jane Lynch's character, Calhoun.<br/><br/>There is nothing I can criticize about this game, which I enjoyed throughout. The credits are even worth watching. This film is a 10."
"g-bodyl","9","2","3","8 April 2014"," Probably the Best Animated Film of 2012!
","Wreck-It Ralph is Disney Animation at it's best and it even has the feeling of a Pixar movie. Loaded with amazing visuals, a strong voice cast, some sly humor, and some nostalgic video-game references, this film is a must-see for all ages. As a huge fan of arcades growing up, I was able to understand most of these references and it brought out the inner child in me. The film is bright and colorful and it seems to give off happiness, especially in Candy Land.<br/><br/>Rich Moore's film is about a villain named Wreck-It Ralph who yearns to be the good guy after thirty years of being the bad guy. But he travels from game to game trying to become a hero, but because of some unfortunate circumstances, Ralph must save the arcade from a dire threat.<br/><br/>This film has a solid voice-cast full of some good comedians. Who wouldn't recognize the voice of John C. Reilly? He certainly brings Ralph to life. Sarah Silverman is really good and I was surprised to find out she voiced the little girl. Finally, Alan Tudyk impressed me as King Candy main because he sounded exactly like Ed Wynn, who voiced Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland.<br/><br/>Overall, Wreck-It Ralph is a triumphant return to form for Disney. This film is even better than recent Pixar pictures and that is saying something. It's a charming, light-hearted film that's fun for the entire family. Video-game fans will truly appreciate this film and all the subtle video-game references. I sure did. A great film with some inspiring messages. I rate this film 9/10."
"SnoopyStyle","8","2","3","27 September 2013"," Good animation, Great story
","Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) wants to be more than a bad guy. He just wants to be liked. Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) is the guy that everybody likes. Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) is a tough as nail soldier from the game Hero's Duty. Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) is a smart mouthed girl in the game Sugar Rush.<br/><br/>The animation is reminiscent of old arcade video styles. If you've ever played those game, you'll get a sense of nostalgia. Disney has got this part right. The best part of this must be the story. It's a poignant story of a video bad guy who's trying to fit himself into the group. He's isolated, ostracized, and ignored. But he wants to be more than the stereotype. In a way, don't we all want to fit in and be more better than what we are."

","WRECK-IT RALPH<br/><br/>It was really good.<br/><br/>Disney seems to be on form at the moment. Wreck-It Ralph was a lot of fun, and seeing as I am an 80's boy... it was great to see some of the super retro characters on the screen.<br/><br/>When I was a kid I loved playing Mario, Sonic, Street Fighter etc... and a lot of the characters from those games and more appear in this movie.<br/><br/>Ralph is the bad guy from the arcade game Fix it Felix. But when the arcade closes at night and all the games close down... the characters come to life. Ralph is sick and tired of being a bad guy and wants to be a good guy. He feels like all the other characters from his game hate him and he just wants to be accepted. Ralph seems to think that if he gets a medal, he will become popular, so he crashes another game to get a medal... and the adventure begins.<br/><br/>The story is genius. I thought it was very imaginative. The characters were great and likable.<br/><br/>It is also very colourful. I watched this film with my girlfriend, my 12 year old daughter and my 7 month old daughter. My little girl was even glued to the movie for over an hour... until she fell asleep... but I doubt it was the film that sent her to sleep... it was just past her bedtime. :) haha<br/><br/>WIR is not as good as some of the classic Disney films, but it is a great film.<br/><br/>I will give this film 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>A very good movie, and I hope Disney can keep up the good work.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

","***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br/><br/>As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I was stoked. I mean, what could be better than a movie about video games? I had high expectations towards this movie and I can say that it delivered on all fronts. At the beginning, it was good already because you got to see some video game classic characters such as Bowser, Ryu, etc. As the movie progressed on, not only did the movie go into a whole new dimension but it picked up quite nicely. <br/><br/>The graphics, effects, and overall picture were pretty amazing! The whole storyline was what really caught me though. Going into this, I thought that the storyline would only appeal to children. However, many adults can enjoy this film as well. Gamers will most especially enjoy this movie but even if you aren't, it's just as good. The casting was done well in my opinion. Not sure if they made it intentional for the characters to look like the people providing voices for them but I think it was a nice touch. Jane Lynch was spectacular. I think she played the role of Calhoun really well. Along with her back story, she's probably my favorite character after Ralph.<br/><br/>While this movie may be an animation, you would think that all the mushy stuff would only appeal to kids. However, in the scene where the virtual world was literally crumbling and getting shred to pieces with Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) unable to escape, it was quite a touching moment. Probably the best scene of the movie which tested its viewers emotions, well done on that scene. <br/><br/>Overall, Wreck-It Ralph is a really good animation film and is probably the best since Up debuted. The characters were all very likable even the villain. A very good movie for everyone to watch. Not only is it great for everyone, but it does a good job of appealing to your emotions. All in all, this movie takes you on a journey where you just have to hop on and see where the road takes you. <br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","I have been seeing tons of bad movies coming out for the last few years; this movie is like all the cool stuff that those movies were lacking in one big shot.<br/><br/>The opening scene is like the T.A.R.D.I.S from Doctor Who, it starts off simple then BAM its bigger on the inside! There is such detail in every moment of this movie. I really like how they go beyond the normal video games.<br/><br/>I really can relate to Ralph, (although i don't like the guy who voices him) anyway i know how he feels at the start of the movie. I have dealt with so many pretentious people like fix it Felix Jr. , he is like the friend that you grew up with and slowly started to ignore you and take you for granted. He is popular because he is a hero, while Ralph is treated like s*** because he is the villain. I was never really was that popular and watched a popular friend having lots of fun while I'm stuck by myself. <br/><br/>So many of the jokes flourished and really hit right on target. While id love a sequel to this movie i would not want to see what has happened to so many other great movies.<br/><br/>Id recommend this movie to kids and adults alike, although older people would enjoy this movie and the references more."
"Al_The_Strange","9","2","3","6 March 2013"," ""I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad.""
","Gotta love video games. Whether looking at the retro arcade games in their 8-bit glory, or the modern high-definition open-world sandboxes, games have always had a fantastic ability to transport the player into a whole new world, and give them full power and control to explore it, change it, and maybe even wreck it.<br/><br/>In light of this, Wreck-It Ralph is a fun animated adventure somewhat reminiscent of such films as Bolt or Finding Nemo, albeit set in the world of arcade games. Chances are good that you'll geek out at seeing such familiar characters as Qbert, Sonic the Hedgehog, Pacman, and various other classic characters. And, hey, is that a Metal Gear reference I see? Could this one scene be a spoof off of Halo? There's a wealth of geeky references and comedic nuances involved with the arcade world, and the film works with it the best it can.<br/><br/>Regardless, the film isn't all third-party software. It does set up its own environments, each one highly detailed and imaginative, and the film sets up its own rules that sets things up for a very thrilling storyline. In addition to some splendid eye candy, the film does have plenty of action and peril, and it does have some amusing comedy. Even if you're not an avid gamer, audiences of all ages can relate to the lighthearted spirit of the film.<br/><br/>The story is quite decent and clever. The plot builds itself really well on the characters, who prove to be the most endearing aspect of the film. The film digs up some strong and heartwarming themes of self discovery and being yourself. In fact, Wreck-It Ralph shares much in common with the stories for Megamind and Despicable Me, since all three films showcase bad guys who are proud to be evil, but wind up being lovable. Such themes, and a few emotionally strong scenes, help make the film stand out above most other CGI-animated films.<br/><br/>As a CGI-animated film, it looks great, with smooth animation and highly-detailed renderings. Voice-acting is decent, and the writing is pretty fun. This film has a plethora of fun and excellent designs for the characters, locations, props, and costumes. Music is quite fun too.<br/><br/>Recommended.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)"

","Okay. So, it's somehow hard to criticize an animated film because it is incomparable to fictional films. However, I so much appreciate the fact that the writers and producers of this film really worked hard not just on the production, but on the pre-production as well.<br/><br/>Most animated films are just fantasy in nature, but Wreck-It Ralph viewed a different prospective for animated films. It showed a fictional idea of what may be inside the arcade game (even if we know it's just a software. Well, that makes it suited for children), what is happening around, and what is happening between the characters. I was left speechless because the idea is really really great.<br/><br/>I also appreciate the fact that the animation in the movie were adapted from how the real characters in the arcade move. It gave a feeling of realism and was drawn closer to the hearts of gamers.<br/><br/>It was just that it took time before the audience realized what was happening because the introduction was not that clear. I watched with my friends and all of them were baffled at first of the idea. They could have included some voice-over narrations that introduces the storyline. They should have been reminded that not all viewers were gamers, and not all viewers would take time to think of what's happening.<br/><br/>Overall, I'll give it 8 out of 10. Quite good!"
"zurnd","10","2","3","25 February 2013"," I've Never Seen A Film Quite Like This
","Anyone who has read my review of Who Framed Roger Rabbit knows how bonkers I am over that film, but to be honest, I've longed for another film where many famous icons of popular culture unite. Wreck It Ralph was the film I have longed for and in my mind, it's high on the list of best computer animated flicks. This film has one of the most original stories I have ever seen, some of the most likable characters I have ever seen, and some of the best quarks I have ever seen put to film. As a gamer and a lover of films with imaginative qualities, this was a math class daydream come true, and after seeing this film on a cold winter's day, I couldn't be more happier with what I was putting my eyes to. It's like if Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Toy Story got together and had a baby, with video game characters. Wreck It Ralph is one of those films I could definitely sit through a million times plus a billion. <br/><br/>First off, if you are going into the film expecting to see Mario and Sonic as the main heroes, you will be mighty disappointed. In fact, Sonic only makes a brief cameo and Mario doesn't even make an appearance, although he is mentioned by Fix-It Felix Jr. towards the beginning of the film. The main hero, I mean villain, I mean hero/villain is Wreck It Ralph, the nemesis of the arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr. who wants to become good and get a medal. He embarks on a quest throughout many arcade games including the first person shooter Hero's Duty and the racing game Sugar Rush. While trapped within the Sugar Rush game, Ralph befriends a glitch named Vanellope Von Schweetz and vows to help her win a race. Meanwhile, Fix-It Felix Jr. goes looking for Ralph and teams up with the female general from Hero's Duty, Sergeant Calhoun as the two develop an odd, yet whimsical romance that is both comedic and satisfying. <br/><br/>What I go absolutely nuts over in this movie is the many references to the famous arcade games of the 80s and 90s. There are cameos from Dig Dug and a Pooka, the Pong sticks, Q-Bert, Peter Pepper from Burger Time, Ryu and Ken from the Street Fighter franchise, Yuni Verse from Dance Dance Revolution, and everyone's favorite yellow chomper, Pikachu! Nah, just kidding, it's Pac-Man. I love that Root Beer Tapper is an actual bar where the video game characters hang out after a long day of fighting sausages and eating ghosts that turn blue. That is brilliant! I love that the evil King Candy uses the Konami Code to get into his secret layer. That is a perfect nod to the gamers of the 80s! I love that Q-Bert talks in gibberish and his iconic word balloons come up. That is ingenious beyond ingenious! This is certainly a film for all the gamers out there, the young and the old, the old gamers and the new gamers. <br/><br/>But I think the thing I savor most in this movie is the gags in the Sugar Rush world. When Fix-It Felix Jr. and Calhoun go looking for Ralph in the candy forest, they fall into Nes-quik sand only to be saved by Laughy Taffy that expand as they laugh. One of King Candy's henchmen is a green lozenge that gets a lollipop stuck to him by the end of the film. And the palace of King Candy is a powerful threat, especially when Oreo guards are watching the territory, chanting O-Reo, Yum, Yum in a tribute to the Winkie guards in The Wizard of Oz. I literally peed myself watching that part, and it has stuck out in my mind as the most memorable aspect of the film. There are a lot of cheesy references to candy and sweets throughout the film, but I think the unique and diverse plot is where the film really soars. I'm not going to give too much away, but I will say that it's unlike any other plot in any other movie. It's different, it's well thought out, it's fitting for a film about video games, and I dig it. There is also a slight twist towards the end of the film that I really wasn't expecting, but it delivered when it came around and I say kudos to the filmmakers for such a clever revelation. It was almost as dramatic as when Darth Vader revealed himself to be Luke Skywalker's father! What a jaw dropper.<br/><br/>Wreck It Ralph is the best video game movie ever made. Sure, some people will compare it to other video game related films like the infamous 1993 Super Mario Bros film, but from the way I see it, it clearly shows what we love about games and what we don't like about games. The characters die and come back again just like we always do while pushing the buttons of a controller. The film dwells on the catchy and the not so catchy aspects of games and overall showcases how elements of fantasy worlds can come together to form one big fantasy world. The only thing I can really complain about in this movie is that it leaves you wanting more. You want to see what happens to these characters next and you still want to be entangled in the film's pixelated worlds by the time the credits roll. But like Roger Rabbit, this is a lovely film to behold, a lovely film that takes you out of reality and puts you in the depths of a stylized, imaginative world. This is up there with the Pixar films as some of Disney's best classics, and if you are a gamer and an overall lover of motion pictures, this is a delicious candy apple you just have to sink your teeth into."

","I used to spend countless hours (and much money) in video-game arcades as a youth so I was naturally attracted to this original idea from Disney and I am so glad I saw it.<br/><br/>It would be easy to see how this could be passed over as a simple kids film about characters in video games, but it is a lot more than that. The story is intriguing and engaging and deals with adult concepts such as jealousy and revenge alongside the more simple desire to be loved and appreciated. The dialogue is excellent and the characters are perfectly realised with the actors, particularly John McGinley, Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman, putting the perfect pitch of emotion into their avatars.<br/><br/>If I were to be really picky I could say that the film spent too much time in only two or three of the games in the arcade. I suppose the story would be complicated too much if the action were spread over many more games. I was also a little unimpressed with the 3D - I would advise anyone thinking of going to see it to stick with 2D.<br/><br/>Minor quibbles though - this is a very enjoyable movie with a lot of heart and emotion and some magnificent action set pieces, especially the hectic ""Hero's Duty"" game - thoroughly recommended.<br/><br/>I should also mention the exquisite short that preceded the film, ""Paperman,"" a b/w silent love story set in 50s New York - which ends just exactly the way you want every love story to end! A beautiful little cartoon - please, Disney, let's have many more like that."

","Mindset before movie: I saw the preview and as an 80s child, I was screaming with excitement. I told all my friends about it and bugged my girlfriend until it came out, we went and saw it right away. I actually just watched it a 2nd time to see if I still felt the same. Sometimes when you're so excited about a movie the excitement carries through the movie so much that you can even convince yourself something is good even if it's bad because who wants to be that wrong, right? Just like when I saw ""Batman Forever""...up yers Joel Schumacher.<br/><br/>Mindset after movie: It's just as good the second time! This movie was perfectly casted John C. Reilly is awesome, I just wanna hug Sarah Silverman's character (..or the real Sarah Silverman, love her) but the best was King Candy played by Pirate Steve himself, Alan Tudyk. The writing in this movie was amazing, didn't miss a beat. It's one of those ideas that seems to write itself with the endless creativity available in these video game environments. And the throwbacks; Street Fighter, Sonic, Q-Bert, Pac-Man, Centipede, more than I know. I had all these systems and played most of these games growing up. This movie made me feel like a kid again. I know that actual kids will love this too, all kids love candy and there is candy everywhere. The little kid that's in the parents of these kids will spend most of the movie having flashbacks to when they were a kid, like I did. The only thing that sucked was when it ended and I was back in the real world and I realized I'm an adult with adult problems, kind of a bummer.<br/><br/>If you're like me and you grew up in the 80s and loved video games, watch this movie! You'll love it, the kids will love it. I'm gonna buy it even, I know, crazy! I wouldn't get your panties in a twist about the lack of Mario. The fact the Nintendo world was barely touched means there are endless possibilities for a sequel. I'm putting this on the 'hope there will be a sequel' shelf right next to ""The Incredibles"".

","When the lights go off at Litwak's Arcade, it's just the end of another day on the job for all the video game characters. Like any working stiff after a days work, they go home and party, visit friends, chill at a bar. Using Game Central Station, characters can leave their own game and live their lives until the Arcade reopens the next day. One such life is that of Wreck-It Ralph, the ""villain"" in the game ""Fix-It Felix Jr"". Having become disenfranchised with never getting the love and recognition the ""good guy"" does, Ralph decides to leave his game and enter another game to win a medal hoping that doing so would finally win him acceptance among the other characters in his game. He journeys through Game Central, to a ""First person shooter"" game called ""Hero's Duty"" where he unwittingly unleashes a ""psy bug"" virus into another game, a kart racing game called ""Sugar Rush"". Along the way, he interacts with well known video game characters, unwillingly causes a near disaster, uncovers a hidden conspiracy and finally finds acceptance in a most unlikely friend. <br/><br/>Wreck It Ralph is to video games what Toy Story is to children's playthings. The story itself feels familiar; we've seen variations of this family friendly, all ages appeal type of story in many previous films from Disney and pixar, just in a different narrative setting. Yet director Rich Moore (better known as director of many Simpsons episodes) present this tale in an ingenious and fresh way. He cleverly uses the CGI format to tap into the boundless imagination and joy that one finds in video gaming. Some of the characters even move in that jerky fashion as seen in old games and designs span the whole gamut of evolving styles from cartoony retro to stylised modern. There is a smart play on irony here too: real life gamers play games to escape, to become another character that they are not in real life, and yet the characters themselves are unable to do that since they are programmed to be who they are and nothing can change that. Escape from reality is precisely what Ralph tries to do. <br/><br/>Key to the appeal of the movie is it's characters. Although lacking in ""A-list"" Hollywood cast members, the voice acting is top notch. Every role is infused with that much personality and emotion that, like any good movie, you forget about actors or their roles and just see these characters as characters. Ralph himself is very easy to relate to; the outcast misfit trying to gain acceptance and to come to terms with a purpose for which to use his talents. Not surprisingly, this sounds like the stereotypical profile of the big sized socially inept gamer boy. Another perspective is that he represents the adult reality; a working stiff who has grown jaded of his job and just wants to escape into another game world. Along the way he meets the annoying Venelope Von Schweets who is the very definition of the word ""brat"". Yet Venelope herself is a character with many layers and below the rude bratty exterior lies a little girl who, like Ralph, just seeks acceptance for who she is. her happy go lucky nature easily represents the inner child without a care in the world yet forced to grow up under less than ideal circumstances. Ralph and Venelope play off each other with perfect chemistry, allowing for one truly heart wrenching scene near the movie's climax. <br/><br/>Cheeky pokes on video game genre stereotypes and at how gaming has evolved through the years. From the simple pleasures of 8-bit platformers to cutsey kart racers to high definition badass First Person Shooters (FPS). Even the characters within those games are parodied. For example, Sgt Tamora, a character in the FPS Hero's Duty gets a tragic backstory so common in such characters. Fix It Felix Jr speaks in an overly polite style with dated slang, further highlighting his game's retro status. Special mention goes to the music score by Henry Jackman who combines orchestra with electronic synths. It goes from a purely electronic simple melody for the retro games, segues into j-pop inspired tunes for the candy inspired Sugar Rush kart game and even lampoons the heavy metal style music in science fiction FPS games. <br/><br/>There is something truly nostalgic here and it is just oozing from the art style, the music, the very concept of the show. The film's only shortcoming is it's animation which looks surprisingly mediocre considering it's 165 million dollar budget. Perhaps a lot of the money went into buying the rights to use characters in cameos like Zangief and Bison from Street Fighter, Sonic the Hedgehog, PAC Man, and other famous video game characters. Another let down is the misleading advertising campaign. Posters and wallpaper featuring all these famous characters walking next to Ralph, or even featured more prominently than the true main protagonists, implying that their role in the film will be a substantial one. Alas, all we get are cameos that never last beyond a minute.<br/><br/>Yet something about the story just tugs on the heartstrings of the inner child. Gaming adults and pop culture enthusiasts will have a thrilling time picking out all the little references and homages while children and children at heart will be amazed by the colorfully creative repackaging of a familiar story. The game world is a world of unlimited potential. Who knows if we might see Ralph, Venelope and their friends move beyond the arcade and into the world of internet Cyber gaming! Now THAT calls for a sequel and fast!"
"sohansurag","8","2","3","14 December 2012"," A true/awesome Video game-Movie!
","Video game movies, if I remember correct, have always sucked! Owe it all to directors like Uwe Boll, who made every other video game adaptation suck. What could have been mediocre if not great video game adaptations were thrashed well beyond recognition. Of course we do have 'loosely- based-on/cheesy-but-enjoyable' Resident Evil franchise and 'Live action movies' based on major game titles produced by the game studios itself ala 'Halo Forward Unto Dawn'. But a good video game-movie was still in destituteness¬Ö.ie until now!<br/><br/>If you are the ones who like to skip previews before the feature film I'd say go early and it'll pay you off quite immensely for there is a gem of a Pixar short to be seen. Entitled 'Paperman', words just fails me to describe how lovely its animated. I wont spoil anything here you just have to watch it for yourself!<br/><br/>The story is paper thin, Ralph plays an antagonist in a game called 'Fix it Felix'. While the protagonist of the game, 'Felix' makes friends with everyone; Good-at-heart-Ralph gets tired playing the bad guy for 30 straight years and he decides to prove that he is not so mean. To please his fellow NPCs he sets on a journey to earn a medal in a game and bring back his glory. The plot sounded good enough to show off a plethora of vivid game worlds that Ralph ends up in, but sadly it ain't so and we are given mere 3 game worlds; Ralph's own 'Fix it Felix' game, the Halo- esque 'Hero's Duty' game and the very kiddish 'Sugar Rush where most of the story takes place. Of course we do get to see the 'Game Central' where most of the game characters as well as NPCs use it as a transit. It was a who's who of characters when it came to Game Central, Sega's characters aplenty along with some old. It all spirals down to a cameo- heaven of a movie filled with truck load of game characters inducing nostalgia in almost every frame. Gamers will know exactly what I am talking about. And there comes the second problem the non-gaming community could well be put off with some of the iconic characters in the movie as they are not aware of em. For instance while I was laughing my ass off at the Metal Gear Solid 'exclamation' in a scene, but my friend was sitting beside me numb seemingly incognizant about the Metal Gear Solid lore. I am sure kids will love it but amidst these Call Of Duty generation who would know about arcade classics like 'Qbert'?<br/><br/>'Ralph' is voiced by John C Reilly and I think nobody could have done it better. He literally voiced life into Ralph. I just could digest Sarah Silverman pulling off a kids voice. Maybe its me, I've seen her literally churn out abuses and couldn't visualize her voicing the 'shes- so-cute, I-am-gonna-die-Vanellope'. On the other hand Jane Lynch's PG13 trash spewing bad-ass 'Calhoun' was a pure delight to watch and maybe its coz she's portrayed as one hot female gamer. Alan Tudyk's 'King Candy' too was a worthy mention.<br/><br/>The animation is spot on, from the jerky movements of the characters in Fix It Felix to the super fluid 'HD' animations of Hero's Duty it all complements the appropriate game worlds. Myself being an FPS fanatic, I loved 'Hero's duty' game and would like to get my hands on it. Fix It Felix will make you relive your old arcade adventures. The score by Henry Jackman was pure awesome. He's turning out to be quite a Hans Zimmer. He'd composed the score for X-Men First Class and it had been one of my favorites from last year. Equally satisfying is the soundtrack featuring excellent tracks by Owl City, Skrillex and Rihanna. My favorite was the 'Celebration' track by Kool & Gang. Be sure to check out the soundtrack, its worth it.<br/><br/>Wreck-it Ralph is an incredibly fresh and heartfelt take on videogames. Its not a video game adaptation per se but its a movie made for video game lovers by video game lovers. As I said before, non-gamers and even casual gamers may find themselves disrupted but not too be distracted from the plot."

","This is my favorite animated movie of 2012, and of course Disney's man it ought to be good in quality. The story line was good, not a complicated one that make you to think twice to understand rather watching the visual treat. its enjoyable and love to watch again in big screen.<br/><br/>Next I would rate very well the music, its the best part of the movie. Music by Henry Jackman quite fits the movie very well. Cinematography is quite brilliant, nice creativity by the art director Ian Gooding.<br/><br/>Director Rich Moore could have taken the way the movie goes in better. Sometimes it lacks the entertainment part because what I thought was not there which I felt could be better rather what happened in movie.. However, the characters like Ralph , Vanellope , Fix it Felix makes happier..<br/><br/>Anyway its a visual treat for all. I don't categorize this movie with gender. It's suitable for all, every ages could enjoy."

","These movies... animated movies... are so difficult to rate.<br/><br/>Because they all take you places that don't really exist. How do you know it's a good movie when you have no frame of reference? Should you judge them for how they make you feel? Or the worlds they create? Either way - there's so much to enjoy about Wreck-it Ralph I really wouldn't know where to start.<br/><br/>It's just so obvious when you love whatever it is that you do. And it's immediately apparent how much love everyone who was involved with the movie have for video games and animation. To say that Ralph's worlds were perfect would be an understatement - they are reinterpretations of the perfection that the original video games already were. There's one reason why Pac-Man, Q*Bert, Street Fighter, etc. are still in our collective consciousness - and that's because they did everything they could with the very limited resources of the time in the best way possible. But watching them, reinterpreted, on the movies is an awesome sight. ""Ralph"" shows an entire world where you can lose yourself into, looking for the smallest, tiniest detail you may have just missed.<br/><br/>The story is pretty good and fun; the cameos by every video game character are fantastic, the animation is as stunning as anything. It's such a great movie I can hardly believe it comes from Disney, and not Pixar."

","This movie, from all the movies I've watched this year really made its mark. Its the first Disney Movie since Toy Story in which I was just completely blown away and was left completely in suspense. The advertising does show exactly how Wretch-It Ralph feels about his place in the world. I think it actually is a very relatable theme that many people can relate to. Essentially his game and the pressure from the system is forcing Ralph to be the big bad and unlovable person that he was created to be. Ralph shows them off by his heroic actions in the film. Besides from the theme the rest of the movie is completely unpredictable, and even more so, because of the games and plots that conjoin throughout the movie. Without giving spoilers, Wretch-It Ralph finally finds two things that he was looking for. One is what he was originally looking for, and the second which is what he found on his journey while looking for the first. The question for him is which of them really give him the value he is looking for."
"HollywoodAlicia","10","2","3","27 November 2012"," Adorable; a great movie all around
","Wreck-It Ralph was one of the best animated movies I've seen in a long time, and that's saying something. There are gems out there like Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., and A Bug's Life, and this may have just topped them all. It was different than all other Disney movies, which was so nice to see. Whoever thought of the idea for having a ""real world"" inside of arcade games deserves a pat on the back. 'Game Central Station'¬Ö I mean, come on! That's genius! The graphics, the plot of the different games, the characters, it's what made it so good! The whole movie was so intriguing, like an actual video game. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the humor between Venellope and Ralph. It was very immature, but then again it is a kid's movie.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly was so perfect for this role, and Jane Lynch as Calhoun was great, too. I wish they disguised her voice, though because I couldn't stop thinking of Sue Sylvester. And then we have Sarah Silverman as Venellope‚Äì I've gotta say that her voice matched her character, but her voice annoyed me so much. And lastly, I had to give a shout-out to my boy Skylar Astin as Roy. Good job Skylar!<br/><br/>Lastly, let me end with the adorable mini film ""Paperman"" in the beginning. Did it bring tears to your eyes, too? The premises of it was a young man and woman who met at a train station come together again by fate¬Ö or paper airplanes. Definitely a great way to start off!"
"jchang358","9","2","3","17 November 2012"," Brilliant film for the whole family
","I first heard of wreck-it-ralph a couple of months ago and i was pretty hyped with the concept of a video game related movie by Disney. i had very high expectations as i went to watch but i was also kind of expecting the typical stuff you would expect from a Disney animated movie. After watching this i can say that this movie far exceeded my high expectation an is easily in my top 5 movies of this year.<br/><br/>First of all i think is relevant to know about me to know what type of person is reviewing this. i am 20 years old student that enjoys video games and was drawn to this game by the cameos of iconic games like Sonic of Street Fighter. i enjoy most type of movies and although it hard to admit i like cheesy stuff when its done right. i say this because this movie will be cheesy and corny at some points but i think it does it in a way that most of the people won't mind unless you are a heartless ""i'm too cool to watch kids show"" guy.<br/><br/>Let's start with the story. for an animated movie, BRILLIANT. don't expect the depth of a thriller or mystery movie but expect something kind of childish with a lot of depth. Everything fits really well together there a lot of little details that makes the story really shine. there some parts you would expect but also really amazing plot twists that make sense and make you say ""how did i now see that!"" just because it fits so well. the environment is most of the time VERY childish i mean expect a lot of pink and cute stuff all around. but honestly it just gives the movie more opportunities to make good innocent humor. however, there are parts that are less childish that i'm sure will appeal to larger audience.<br/><br/>Now with characters. probably one of the best aspects of the game. the characters show very human behavior even being video game characters. you can actually relate to all of them and know why the do what they do all of this while retaining their uniqueness. for an animated movie the background of each character is pretty depth and they even went on describing some of the secondary character's background so i think that was nice. also Vanellope is by far the biggest heart-Stealer i have seen in a long time you will just grow to love this character sooooooooooo cute and i say this in a very manly way.<br/><br/>on other stuff i think animation was amazing. 3D is definitely worth it with this one and overall just really good. the sound was good, kind of too pop but it kind of goes with it and they didn't have any other choice. The humor is very innocent yet clever and overall i really enjoyed this series.<br/><br/>In conclusion i think this a great family film i recommend it to anyone who has no issues of watching a VERY well made kinds movie but if you are not into innocent humor, inspirational message and cute stuff then you may want to skip it but i'm guessing you are OK with those since you are reading the review of the film anyways.<br/><br/>well, thanks for reading!!"

The humor is crude.

","I have seen this movie and I liked it very much, Ralph is portrayed as a villain is rejected by the Nicelanders, more like Jerklanders. Ralph loses his temper and Felix has to help out Ralph.<br/><br/>I liked how Ralph tells everybody he's tired of being the bad guy and everybody reacts in the room, Ralph goes home and goes to a party, the Jerklanders refuses to accept Ralph which causes Ralph to wreck the cake and then he runs away from home to a bar and he steals the armored suit from a Soldier to play in Hero's Duty which he interferes with the game. He then steals the gold medal from the game, the bug attacks him and he goes in the escape pod and rockets to Sugar Rush.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the teenage girl customer plays Wreck-it-Ralph but the game's unplayable due to Ralph missing, the teenage girl and the arcade owner think the game is out of order and the Jerklanders panic, Fix-it-Felix gets information from Q-bert and goes to Hero's Duty and meet his girlfriend Calhoun. they head over to Sugar Rush.<br/><br/>Ralph meets an annoying little girl Vanellope who is a glitched character has stolen Ralphs gold medal and entered into the race, Ralph attacks the race vouchers and is arrested by the donut police and he is taken to King Candy who's also Turbo the racer. Ralph escapes and helps Vanellope train for the race and mistakenly smashes her race car, he goes home to his arcade game only to find it abandoned, he discovers Vanellope is a real character, he rescues Fix-it-Felix and Vanellope,<br/><br/>Then Vanellope races and contends against Turbo, the Cy-bug virus breaks out and interrupts the race. Ralph rides a hoverboard and fights Turbo the mutant bug. Ralph crashes through the mentos volcano and it erupts and all of the cy-bugs gets zapped by the pillar of light including Turbo. Vanellope finishes first and the game gets restored back to normal and she becomes a Princess of her game. Fix-it-Felix and Calhoun gets married, Ralph is welcomed back and the Jerklanders finally becomes real Nicelanders, Ralph is back in his game and the arcade owner is convinced it's working again and people line up to play Wreck-it-Ralph.<br/><br/>This was the funniest movie ever, we got to see Sonic the Hedgehog, Street Fighter characters, Bowser, Pac-man and the Ghosts. I liked the video game jokes made in this movie, there was even police officers as donuts and their devil dogs which made me laugh, I liked the laffy taffies singing, I liked the Sugar Rush world. I wish Disney would make an E rated Sugar Rush video game, I also wished they would make a T rated game Hero's Duty, sadly we never get to play those games. I liked how the world of Sugar Rush is basically junk food land, and Hero's Duty is a dark world.<br/><br/>I liked the part where the bad guys reacts to Ralph wanting to be a good guy, I liked the security check where Ralph is sneaking a cherry. I also liked it how fix-it-Felix accidentally made the bars bigger. I liked how Ralph panicked in Hero's Duty and interferes with the game. I also liked the build your race car scene. I also liked Calhoun reacting with her sad memory of her wedding being ruined. The best part about this movie is the hoverboard scene where Ralph saves the day.<br/><br/>I liked Ralph who's bad tempered, I liked Fix-it-Felix, Calhoun a strict soldier and most of the characters including the Zombie man, Donut Police, the Bartender, the hologram soldiers, the candy creatures.<br/><br/>I didn't like Turbo who's King Candy that crashed the racing arcade game, or the Nicelanders who were Jerklanders as they caused Ralph to run away from home and almost got their game terminated.<br/><br/>Overall this was the best Disney CGI animated film. There's a sequel to this movie but I strongly suggest you ignore the sequel ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" it's a letdown. This movie has won many best animated awards. Anyway's this will be always be my favorite Disney movie next to Treasure Planet, Meet the Robinsons."
"ashleighabsurd","10","1","1","28 May 2019"," Love this film
","Being one of my favourite Disney movies and having not seen the second movie yet I thought it would be a good idea to watch the first one and get reacquainted with the characters and the story in which I enjoy so much. This is a film in which I always look forward to watching and that I like the concept of as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I love that Wreck-It Ralph shows the movie from a bad guys perspective who just wants to be accepted for who he is but because of his job people don't respect him. Having him want to get a medal to change this and gain the respect of those around him I think is really sad and shows how he does not feel like he is good enough because of those around him. This is such a strong message in my opinion about how people only see you the way that they want to and not for the person in which you are and how people have a strong impact on people. I think that by having him go into another game to get a medal however ending up in a car game where is helping a little girl achieve her dreams of racing is so sweet and I like that it showed how the girl liked him for who he was and that he didn't have to pretend to be someone who he wasn't. This showed that people will like you for yourself and sometimes you just need to meet new people and find the ones in which accept you as yourself with. Showing later in the film how the good guy in the game Ralph belongs to called Felix realising how he isn't liked elsewhere and understanding how Ralph feels is powerful as it helps to show how just because you are liked somewhere doesn't mean everyone else will like you and that sometimes going through someone else's experience can help you to understand them as well as create a new kind of bond with them. Finally, I like how the King in the racing game was pretending to be nice but underneath was mean which helped to highlight how some people can put on an act about being a nice person but can have an evil core and will do anything to turn people against one another like he does to one of the children within the game, showing how some people can be bad even when they don't act like it all of the time. Personally, the animation style of this movie is something in which I really like and really helped to make this more of an arcade type feel to the movie. Not only this but showing arcade characters within the movie which people are aware of such as Bowser, Sonic and others was a nice way of showing different games in which an older audience was able to enjoy and bring them back to their childhood. Not only this but by having a bad guy support group was something in which I thought was really cool as it showed how they all felt the same and that they wanted to be liked by others and that even though they were classed as villains they still have feelings and wanted to talk about them, which made them feel more human.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is one of the best Disney movies around in my opinion and I can't wait to watch the second one. This is a film in which I think the whole family would enjoy and does have a great message for children in which I think is a key aspect of this movie. I would highly recommend this to Disney fans, people are fans of video games and those who are looking for a movie to watch with the whole family. I am definitely going to be seeing this again"
"dineshaishu","10","1","1","20 May 2019"," Wreck-it ralph
","Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game called ""Sugar Rush"". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.<br/><br/>I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever - a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.<br/><br/>So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave (which was also very good).<br/><br/>John C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character, who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the ""Sugar Rush"" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a ""glitch"" (a character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock) has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main character in a first-person shooter game known as ""Hero's Duty"", who tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.<br/><br/>I didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp, pristine screen.<br/><br/>The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.<br/><br/>The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.<br/><br/>Generally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this movie, they're going to fall in love with it."

It has something for everyone from kids, to teens, to nostalgic adults.<br/><br/>The story is credible within it's universe, and it's fun to try and spot the subtle Easter eggs and callbacks to other games that don't get the spotlight.<br/><br/>It's one of very few films of which had a twist that genuinely caught me off-guard, and I can respect that hugely seeing as it's a bit more of a kid's film."

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>""Wreck-It Ralph"" is one of the most original ideas I've seen for a movie in a long time - and it took the wonder of computer graphics to bring its imagining full scale to the silver screen in a way no other type of animation could have. In other words, you don't have to do any brain work here - they've already done it all for you.<br/><br/>In the world of arcade video games, Wreck-It Ralph is one of the ""bad"" guys. He destroys - and the game's hero, Fix-It Felix Jr., repairs. It is a rather simple video game with simple graphics and programming - and after 30 years of being the bad guy, being the outcast and living alone during the down times, Ralph has had enough. He wants to win a medal and be the hero for a change. This leads to a chain of events that finds him bouncing out of his game to another one called ""Hero's Duty"", where he actually claims his coveted prize medal. However, when he accidentally ends up in another game called ""Sugar Rush"", a little glitch called Vanellope gets in the way of his dream - and the only way to reclaim it is to help her realize hers.<br/><br/>A fun movie from top to bottom, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" does a great job of building strong characters while crossing different eras and genres of video gaming effectively. The main backdrop of the story is in Sugar Rush, with everyone who's pulled into it from other games having a pivotal part in saving that video game's universe.<br/><br/>This one comes at a high recommend. It brings back the good ol' days of arcade video gaming which was so prevalent in the 80's (my generation) - a time gone by. Seeing the old Nintendo game controller was fun too, which heralded in the age of home video gaming on a large scale. I am anxiously looking forward to watching the sequel next."

","Wreck-it Ralph opens a door to a universe which hosts us everyday but we just don't know it. Although Ralph character is similar with Shrek and his world is similar to what we see in Toy Story, I think this movie is still so original. First of all, it has a point. And every time a animation comes with a good point, it become successful. Wreck-it Ralph is one of them. It has well written characters; such an amazing villain; a story with flow; incredible references and easter eggs like cola-mentos relationships, soldiers made of oreo, sonic, pac-man, mario, street fighter... Also it proves bad guys can become good and good ones can become bad. Or maybe we don't know them really. It becomes dramatic during the movie."

","This is a great movie to see if you're an adult gamer or if you have children who love gaming. The movie's premises is basically same as Toy Story except with game characters that come to life when the arcade closes at night. However this basic premises is the only similarity and Wreck it Ralph has a lot of unique elements in the story line that allows it to stand out on its own. I really think this movie is extremely underrated and there was a lot of twists and turns in the movie that I just did not predict but the movie really pulled it all together. It was a real pleasure to watch this movie and it caters well to older children and adults."

"bankofmarquis","8","1","1","12 November 2018"," Deserves greater praise than it currently is given
","Not being a big video game guy, I was late to the party to the original WRECK-IT RALPH in 2012 and when I saw it, I thought ""it's fine"" and didn't really think more about it. Now that it's sequel is coming out, I thought it would be good time to revisit this film (and to also remind me of the characters of the first one). And I'm glad I did, for I enjoyed myself much more this go around with this film than I did in my initial experience.<br/><br/>Taking a page out of PIXAR, this WALT DISNEY ANIMATION STUDIOS picture tells the ""inside story"" of what happens to Video Game characters when the lights go off. Following a ""villain"" in a game, WRECK-IT RALPH tells the story of Ralph's attempt to become a hero by winning a medal in another video game, only to become something more when he encounters a ""glitch"" in another game.<br/><br/>This is a well made, smart animation film that has enough action, suspense and silliness to appeal to children, but enough ""adult content"" (read: smart humor that goes over the heads of the kids) to appeal to the adults that have taken the kids to the movies. It pays great homage to video games - many of which went over my head, but (I am assured) were well played (at least according to the video gamers that I am acquainted).<br/><br/>Like all animated movies, a good percentage of the joy of this film is in the voice work - and this picture has very good ones from Sarah Silverman's Vanellope to Jack McBrayer's Fix-It Felix and Jane Lynch's kick-butt Calhoun, the voices strongly portray the character - and character types - quickly and easily. Special mention should be made of Allan Tudyk's King Candy (an homage to the the great Vaudeville and early film comedian Ed Wynn) and, especially, John C. Reilly in the title role. He is perfectly cast as Ralph, showing the weight of the size of the character in his voice with a sweetness and vulnerability that shows the size of the character's heart.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful and winning film, one that deserves greater praise than it is currently given, and I, for one, am looking forward to the sequel coming out.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

","Wreck it Ralph, an unprecedented movie, filled with action, emotion and generally nostalgia for ""the old good days"" were arcade games were popular.

As long as the animation is concerned, it's just wonderful seeing all these diffirent colouful arcade worlds, but I can't talk more for that, it's something you NEED to see to understand it.<br/><br/>At last, I loved how movie shows arcade games evovling throught the years and 
how they affected the gamers' lives by giving them joy and entertainment and freedom to another world.

"Animated_Antic","9","1","1","7 August 2018"," A funny and heartwarming film on video games.
","Video game movies suck. There's really no denying that. For the past twenty years Hollywood has tried to turn a video game into a movie and most attempts have completely failed and even some like ""Mortal Kobmat: Annihilation"" and ""Alone in the Dark"" have been considered some of the worst films to have ever been made. Where most video game movies end up disasters, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is certainly not one. In fact, it's a great animated movie. Made by Walt Disney Animation Studios who has started a big comeback, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is not only just another great addition into the Disney canon but also one of, if not, the best animated movies to come out in 2012.<br/><br/>When an arcade called Litwak's closes for the night, the video game characters there take a break from their jobs and go out and socialize with other characters by leaving their games and traveling to a power surge. One of the video games there is Fix it Felix Jr. and while it's titular hero (Jack McBrayer) is loved by the residents of the game, it's villain Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) is shunned and treated like a typical bad guy despite his friendly attitude and soft heart. Sick of always being left out of the fun, Ralph decides to leave his game behind in search for a metal hoping he can gain the respect of others. He eventually finds one in a shooter called Hero's Duty, but an incident there accidentally lands him in a go-cart game called Sugar Rush. There he meets a little girl named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) a character who is also mistreated by her peers and prevented from racing for being a glitch. She steals the metal and uses it to enter an upcoming race much to Ralph's dismay. Hoping to get his metal back, Ralph ends up working with Vanellope to help her win a race and get his metal back. Meanwhile Felix and the hero from Hero's Duty, Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch), team up in order to find Ralph before the arcade opens the next morning.<br/><br/>The story in this film is pretty clever. It takes that same old characters coming to life when no ones looking trope we've seen before and turn it into something fresh and new. Despite the trailers having primary focus on famous video game characters like Pac-Man, Zangeif and Bowser, the film like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" focuses more on the original characters like a great movie should. Speaking of the characters they definitely are what they make the movie great. The glue that ultimately holds the movie together is the friendship developed between Ralph and Vanellope and how similar they are. They're both pretty badly mistreated by the residents of their own games respectively and seeing how both share the same dream of wanting to become respected is really something nice to see. I also like how they don't make Felix the villain of the movie which would've been an easy choice. Instead they actually make him likable and friendly to Ralph and also seeing him team up with Sgt. Calhoun led to some pretty hilarious moments. The animation is top notch quality again and the worlds that Disney built for the film are so eye-catching. The world of Sugar Rush in particular is so outstandingly detailed that it's clear lots of research went into making every candy seen in the game edible. If I did have a problem with the movie, it's just that some of the jokes went on a little too long. The film is pretty hilarious, but I feel at times some of the jokes did drag a bit.<br/><br/>""Wreck-It Ralph"" is definitely one of the best movies on video games I've seen with a story that feels fresh and original, very detailed animation and some pretty fantastic characters. This is definitely a great movie for video game fans out there and even if you're not a huge fan of them, I still highly recommended you see this movie. I guarantee there's something in it you might like."

","In the arcade since 1982, video game creator Wreck it Ralph (voiced by John C Reily) from the popular 80s arcade game ""Fix It Felix"" where in that game, Ralph is the bad guy who wrecks buildings and Fix it Felix (voiced by Jack Mcbryer) fixes things with a magic hammer as the game is kind of like Rampage meets Donkey Kong sort of thing. Ralph is just tired of being the bad guy over the years and wants to do something good like get a metal but some of the other video game bad guys and some Fix it Felix video game residents are worried that he's going soft as he's suppose to be the bad guy. So he decides to jump into another game in the arcade called ""Hero's Duty"" which is a sci-fi first person shooters game in the tradition of ""Aliens"" (1986) and Halo series which he gets a ""hero"" metal from the game but accidentally gets in a flying space vehicle as he accidentally goes into the game of ""Sugar Rush"" which is kind of a candyland-esque racing game. He not only is in the game but accidentally brings something deadly that will soon infect the game which would soon infect the arcade, he also meets Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) who is a glitz/outcast in her game as she wants to win the race so she can be a racer but everyone in the video game's kingdom is against her. King Candy (voiced by alan Tudyk) wants to get rid of her as he has a sinister secret, but can Ralph find out what makes a person truly a hero? as Felix with Hero Duty tough as nails Calhoun (Jane Lynch) can help him even fight the evil that will soon invade Sugar Rush.<br/><br/>Excellent and entertaining CG animated Disney feature that i saw 4 times in theaters and been one of my fave movies of 2012. Such an interesting, original and well made comedy-fantasy from Rich Moore who did Zootopia/Sit Down and Shut Up/The Simpsons/Mighty Mouse the All New Adventures and with a great script. The animation in this movie is quite stunning and one of the better CG animated Disney studios animated feature, i also love the concept of video game characters meeting each other and if the arcades close they would jump into other games for meetings, going to bars/restaurants and all that. It has cameos by Street Fighter characters, Sonic The Hedgehog, Bowser of Mario Brothers fame, Q-Bert, Root Beer Tapper and others as it has that Toy Story/Who Framed Roger Rabbit feel of crossover stuff in it. <br/><br/>The voice performances are very well done and witty with a good dose of humor in the script and some heart as well. The characters are likable and fun even the villain himself is quite hilarious as he's a comical villain. The movie captures the essence of classic and new games especially for the Root Beer Tapper on his movements, there's retroness of 80s/90s in this movie when they were 2 great times of arcade mania. One of my top movies of 2012 and the sequel should be awesome."

","Set in a backdrop of modern day games and entertainment, Wreck-It-Ralph is an extraordinary tale of unconventional friendships, fierce determination, and far-reaching dreams in a land of routine and established identities. <br/><br/>The film's message is clear & the moral is simple -- Dare to be different, yet the unique vision and approach of Director Moore has made a seemingly ordinary kid's movie into a mesmerizing journey of courage, consequence, and eventual self discovery. One of the few films that actually live up to the ideals it conveys, Wreck-it-Ralph is on a league of its own as it marries contemporary wisdom with traditional values that people of all ages could learn something from."

Who would have ever thought that you could bring them to life the way the movie makers have! It will make you look at these games in a different way the next time you go to a shopping mall. <br/><br/>The graphics are just too well done and bring each of the characters to life. Especially the whole idea of video games having a life of their own. You can just picture these characters all shutting down after the day is over and just chilling out among themselves. That's how well they have been brought to life. <br/><br/>Each of the main characters of the movie, Ralph, Vanellope, Felix, King Candy, all teach you some little thing that can make you a better person. Even King Candy can teach you a thing or two about how to deal with life's little disappointments. <br/><br/>In a world today where the art of story telling is probably dying out with parents having less time to spend with their children, it's nice to see animated movies bringing out values that we should be teaching kids like love, hope, treating people right, never giving up."
"dfranzen70","8","1","1","5 May 2013"," The princess is in this castle
","When the villain of a popular arcade game decides he's had enough of being the bad guy, he sets out to win over the other denizens of his game, with hilarious consequences. Wreck-It Ralph is a wonderful little film that combines smart dialog, brilliant animation varieties, and an abundance of familiar video-game characters - even to those who don't play games on a regular basis.<br/><br/>Ralph (voice by the underrated John C. Reilly) has one job - wreck an apartment building. When a kid puts a quarter into the machine's slot. Ralph shouts his catch phrase and then climbs the building (he's quite large), destroying windows, bricks, the whole nine yards, until the hero of the game, Fix-It Felix (voice of Jack McBrayer) arrives to save the day (with the help of the human player). The game is sort of a combination of Donkey Kong (helpful handyman) and Rampage, a game in which huge monsters scaled skyscrapers just to destroy them.<br/><br/>Anyway, Ralph has a quandary. While the rest of game's characters live in the fancy building within the game, he lives in a literal pile of bricks and dreams of something more. And when he notices that Felix is throwing a party celebrating the game's 30th anniversary without inviting Ralph...well, Ralph doesn't much appreciate that and vows to win a medal, any medal, in order to convince the building's occupants that he's not as bad as everyone thinks.<br/><br/>This leads Ralph to jump into other games, a tactic that's forbidden. He winds up in a first-person shooter game much like Call of Duty, sneaking in as a foot soldier, and manages to grab a medal. Long story short (ha), this sort of screws up that game for the human player, and the main character of said war game has to track Ralph down among the other games in the arcade, because she realizes something else has left the game with Ralph.<br/><br/>Ralph winds up in a game that's a mixture of Mario Kart and Candyland. Actually sounds like fun, doesn't it? He meets Vanellope (voice of Sarah Silverman), who's a glitch, an error in the game's code that would be more trouble to remove than leave in, so in she stays. Vannelope manages to get Ralph's precious medal but promises to give it back if he'll help her build a racecar so she can win the game's race. Well, the race within the game. Still with me? Vannelope is an outcast as a glitch, so she has quite a bit to prove. Ralph, of course, will help her, even though she's a smart-aleck little brat. <br/><br/>Is there more to all of this than meets the eye? Sure! Will it go over most kids' heads? No! Is it still enjoyable for physically grown-up people? Heck yes! Sure, this is a Disney film, so Lessons will be Learned, but there's so much eye-candy - uh, literally - that the message is not heavy handed in the least. And what is that message? Nonspoiler alert - it might be that Ralph does have what it takes to be a Good Guy after all. <br/><br/>I loved how there were so many different characters from different game systems (Nintendo, XBox, arcade-only, Sega, you name it); the Bad Guy support group includes one of the ghosts from Pac-Man, Bowser from the Mario games, M. Bison from Street Fighter, one of the guys from Mortal Kombat, and so on. Each is drawn in his own original style. Same for the various good guys who make cameos in the movie, like Sonic the Hedgehog, and Pac-Man himself. The blending of art styles is impeccable and spectacular. I'm also a fan of quick wit, and Silverman can quick-wit with the best of them, particularly when matched against a slow-witted character like Ralph. Oh, and did I mention the Candy King? Yeah, he runs things in that candy racecar game, and he's voiced by Alan Tudyk (Firefly) with an accent right out of old Hanna-Barbera films. Priceless.<br/><br/>Is Wreck-It Ralph a great film? Not exactly, but it's hard to find a comparable movie. Other Disney movies have their own style, as do the Disney/Pixar films. This one is a stand-alone treat, exhilarating for kids of all ages, especially those who grew up playing that old 8-bit NES. Or those of us who were stuck with the Atari 2600. Or those who spent hours and hours in actual arcades, fighting space invaders and helping a dumb frog cross a freeway. And even if you've never once picked up a game controller, you'll appreciate the humor, the voice delivery, the story, and the message."
"rolandddd","9","1","1","18 April 2013"," Oh the wonderful nostalgia
","Usually when it comes to animated movies, I reserve my highest praise for Pixar movies. They have constantly raised the bar for animated movies for the last decade or so, and the competition has had a tough time getting close with their efforts. That is why I'm so pleased to see such a good challenger for honors, from in-house competitors Walt Disney Animation Studios.<br/><br/>The plot works well, focusing on video game bad boy Ralph, who is tired of being the villain and wants to bask himself in the glory of heroes by winning a medal. But what makes this a winner in my eyes is that it manages to capture both the young and the old. The story itself is good enough, but what makes me fall for it is all the connections to the old video games I used to love. Growing up in the 80s and early 90s, I just love seeing the characters I used to know from back in the days, including Pac-man and Q-bert, not to mention Bowser or Dr Robotnik.<br/><br/>I really had a good time watching this, and it gives Brave a run for its money being my favorite animated movie of 2012."
"mcfjr42","10","1","1","7 April 2013"," Disney Has Done it Again!
","It's pretty disturbing to see all the hate for Disney lately. Sure, they've purchased Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Marvel, but that does not mean they are going to ruin the quality of all those things. People seem to be deluded into thinking Disney makes awful movies; to prove them wrong, you need only point out Wreck-It Ralph.<br/><br/>The story is actually very similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas: A dissatisfied villain (the titular Ralph, played perfectly by John C. Reilly) who is tired of the same old thing decides to go out and try something different. Ralph, after a disastrous appearance at his game's anniversary party, decides to jump into the game Hero's Duty and win a medal to prove he can really be a good guy to the NPCs in his game. Things don't go smoothly however, and Ralph ends up crash landing in the candy go-kart game Sugar Rush, where he meets Vanellope, a bratty little kid (played by Sarah Silverman) who steals his medal so she can enter the daily race. Soon enough, Ralph and Vanellope are forced to form an unlikely partnership to get what they want, and this drives the remainder of the plot.<br/><br/>The animation in this movie is fantastic, even better than Tangled. The opening zoom into the Fix-It Felix arcade character where it goes from 8-bit to 3D gets me every time. <br/><br/>The music is good as well; Skrillex actually provides a good track used in the Hero's Duty part of the movie, Owl City gives an excellent credits song, and Buckner & Garcia of ""Pac-Man Fever"" fame give one of the catchiest songs in recent memory to the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The voice acting, as is often the case for Disney, is fantastic. Jane Lynch is especially fantastic as Calhoun, the leader of the space marines in Hero's Duty who aids Fix-It Felix in his quest to find Ralph (though she's also tracking down a virus from her game that could potentially destroy the arcade). Alan Tudyk channels the Mad Hatter from Disney's Alice in Wonderland in his role as King Candy, who is one of the most amusing characters in the film, and certainly one of the funniest Disney antagonists.<br/><br/>The video game references scattered throughout are also well-done. From the opening Bad-Anon meeting to the 'Sonic Sez' to Q*Bert's somewhat big role, the cameos and appearances never disappoint. The graffiti seen throughout the movie contains even more references, and the background of Game Central Station and Tappers is filled with little shout outs to dozens of video game series.<br/><br/>This is probably one of my favorite films of all time, and likely one of Disney's finest films. I highly recommend it; this movie is perfect for kids and adults alike."

","Disney's Wreck it Ralph presents as an animation visual thrill ride through multiple video game worlds, the audience is besot with comic gags and punchy one liners but is ultimately left to believe that while we are all interconnected we also exist within the restricted confines of our own social strata. Through survey of film theories in Structuralism, Constructivism, Post-Structuralism, Post-Modernism, Post-Humanism and finally Super-modernity it may be proved that such children's fantasy entertainment posits social expectations within the impressionable spectator. Wreck it Ralph as a mainstream entertainment vehicle lends credence to the empowerment of the individual whom does not feel accepted by the status quo through recognition that as individuals we must determine our own self-worth within our respective cultures."
"Left-Handed_Liz","8","1","1","15 March 2013"," ""The kids call me retro, which I think means 'old, but cool.'""
","To be honest, as fun and imaginative as this film looked in the trailers, I was hesitant to see the movie, since I was concerned that the humor and subtext (if there was any) would be largely lost on me, a non-gamer. When I finally got to see it at the dollar theater, it reminded me why I love animated films so much. What these movies excel at is retelling a familiar story in an unfamiliar setting. Children's and family media has plenty of ""villain"" protagonists, from How The Grinch Stole Christmas to Megamind, and plenty of underdog stories- specifically, the journeys of misfits proving their worth to society and to themselves. Wreck-It Ralph has both these elements heavily influencing the plot, but almost never comes off as contrived or repetitive. <br/><br/>One reason why is, as I said before, the setting. The art shift between the arcade game worlds, whose designs are all distinct, but are all believably interconnected in the network of tubes and code that links all the arcade games together in ""Game Central Station."" The jerky movements and the rounded, egg-like shape of the townspeople in ""Fix-It Felix, Junior"" is just as familiar and real (or rather, unreal) as the ""Hero's Duty"" soldiers' stiff, lumbering gait, or the bounce and skip of the anime-esque inhabitants of ""Sugar Rush Speedway."" Even if you've never played a video game, it's easy to recognize all the styles and aesthetics as authentic, if decidedly enhanced for a higher-quality medium. The viewer is allowed to explore the world of each game along with the characters, getting to experience a variety of landscapes through the journey. It was a joy to be immersed in those almost-too-bright colors and the variety of textures (something still lacking in many live- action films which use CGI) that created the confectionery landscape of ""Sugar Rush"". The arcade world is full of humorous, inventive touches, such as an explosion generated by Mentos stalactites falling into a spring of acidic Diet Coke, electrical cords acting as a literal ""tube station"" between games, and storytelling conventions' impact on characters (Sergeant Calhoun is ""programmed with the most tragic back story)"". The rules of the arcade (what few we get), and the threat of being ""unplugged"" if the game breaks down and can't be fixed, is evocative of Toy Story and other such films, and they impact the plot in a similarly dramatic way. <br/><br/>The story was well-executed, in that it followed the pattern of quest/journey to a reward/happy ending (the plot of most classic video games as well, incidentally), but it threw in a few good twists and turns. There's a moment in the film where two characters have a misunderstanding, one thinking that they've been betrayed. This is something that's done a lot to extend a story, and mainly, it's a waste of time for everyone, since the characters just spend the whole time moping until they make up. But there are consequences to the misunderstanding in this film, and it progresses the action, rather than slows it down, with everyone coming together for the finale. <br/><br/>Likewise, a main plot point is the shared bond between Ralph and Vanellope, who both want to change their destiny, but the worlds they live in won't let them. However, the prejudice against them, while shown as a negative thing, is given a valid reason. Being the bad guy is literally Ralph's job, and if he isn't there to do it, the game doesn't work. Vanellope's story, however, turns out to be the much more interesting one. She is an outcast for being a glitch in the game, which, in the other racers' eyes and the king's, means she isn't a real character in the game, and shouldn't be allowed to race. It seems like a typical plot with the bullies just being bullies just because, but then the king gives what sound like a logical explanation, which Ralph and the audience can accept.This revelation raises some questions, and it takes a while before the whole truth is clear. There were a few things that could arguably count as plot holes, but it's hard to quibble when it's a cartoon world whose rules are only explained in a basic sense, especially when the characters are so entertaining. <br/><br/>Standout performances come from John C. Reilly as Ralph, Jack McBrayer as the hilariously innocent, naive Fix-It Felix, Jane Lynch, delivering funny drill-sergeant one liners as Calhoun, and an almost unrecognizable Alan Tudyk, doing his best Ed Wynn impression as the flamboyantly sinister King Candy. Sarah Silverman gave appropriate spunk and wry humor to the mischievous Vanellope VonSchweetz, but hearing that raspy adult woman voice coming out of a rosy-cheeked little girl is a bit distracting at times. The chemistry between all of them created some truly funny and sweet stand-out moments, and my only complaint is that there wasn't enough time to fully develop everyone. Specifically, Calhoun is pretty underplayed, and while there are many obstacles, a real villain doesn't emerge until the last fifteen minutes of the movie .<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is an inventive story that presents a rather literal take on destiny (it's in your code!) finding your place (being a bad guy isn't so bad if you feel loved), and what it means to be a hero (surprise, it's your friends, not a shiny medal). I recommend this film to all fans of animation, gaming/geek culture, and having a good time. It's a relief to find all-ages movies that can play with the formula, and don't rely on swearing or (a lot of) toilet humor to get attention. Disney is always a little ""retro,"" but here, they definitely know how to make it work."
"My_Opinion-245-920801","9","1","1","3 March 2013"," Wildly Entertaining
","Wreck it Ralph is kid friendly at its core and as an added plus equally entertaining to adult. All you can ask for in child entertainment is firstly, a movie or animation that is not overly violent for know apparent reason. Secondly, there should be a clear point that the children can connect too, in perhaps the form of a life lesson, the size of the lesson or point is irreverent at this point. Thirdly, for God's sake the movie or animation should be able to keep an adults interest; albeit barley! <br/><br/>Wreck it Ralph not only was a bona fide hit but my niece and nephew loved the very fact that is was based on video games. My niece loved the character Vanellope, voiced by none other than Sarah Silverman. Whereas my nephew thought Wreck it Ralph was, to use his words ""A good Guy-Not bad guy"" yes, he really liked Wreck it Ralph. John C. Reilly, did an outstanding voice over job as The Ralph personality, I sat through the movie trying to put the voice to a Hollywood face. <br/><br/>However, I would be remiss if I failed to take a shot at Brave winner of the ""best animated feature"" I guess marketing wins over substance. I asked my niece and nephew, whom they preferred, hands down Wreck it Ralph won by a land slide. Furthermore, having performed this rather unscientific poll, I can only assume that a.) Wreck it Ralph came out to late b.) Brave had a massive campaign push that gave it the Oscar edge c.) The Academy dropped the ball yet again. If past evidence has any weight, I whole heartedly believe option C is the most viable option.<br/><br/>Wreck it Ralph was entertaining and taught the little ones that there is more going on then what is on the surface. My niece and nephew, if any indication, loved this movie, and I too think this is a must watch of child and adult alike."

"BharatSamra","8","1","1","24 February 2013"," Pushes all the right buttons...mostly
","The term 'Disney magic' has become somewhat of a clich√© in the realms of 21st century animation. Nonetheless, it cannot be more so appropriately applied than in the consumption of these two delightful Disney animations on your trip to the nearest cinema. If you are confused by my pluralisation of animation, then I will elaborate by saying that the acclaimed studio treats their audience, old and young, with a heart- warming animated short titled Paperman prior to the 92 minute pleasure that you purchased the tickets for. The 7 minute short serves as the appetiser to the enchanting experience that we so commonly associate with the studio's family films, and there is plenty of room left for us to enjoy the great taste of magic at the conclusion of Wreck-It Ralph.<br/><br/>While Wreck-It Ralph pushes many of the formulaic storytelling buttons, you simply do not care. The level of enjoyment is too high to be concerned with attempting to criticise the film for its venture into familiar territory. It still contains a great deal of individuality and originality, primarily through its homage to retro and contemporary video games that many of us know and love. It is recycled material that is so clean and unique that it works as well, if not better than, any original. Put simply, you have fun watching Wreck-It Ralph and I believe no matter the age of the viewer, something will appeal to you in this film. The humour is seemingly directed towards the youngest of demographics for this feature, and I will admit my own slight disappointment at the fact I laughed very few times, a lot less than I was hoping for. However, what the animation may lack in humour, it certainly makes up for in other regions. Many, including myself, will appreciate the nostalgic throwback to video games of the recent and not so recent past. Furthermore, the story of Wreck-It Ralph is exceptionally, and even slightly surprisingly sensational! Each and every element of the plot fits together so incredibly well, that screenwriters Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee have clearly demonstrated their phenomenal talent to make everything in their story relevant, balanced and unanimously appealing. Similarly with previous Disney animations, they manage to take something from many of our everyday lives, and adapt it by creating and exploring a new world of unequivocal genius. One of the most admirable aspects to Wreck-It Ralph is the way in which different gaming worlds interact with one another, whilst staying loyal to their own arcade home. For instance, those in the title character's game possess robotic manoeuvres, while other games appear as actual modern video game gameplay, and as a gamer, I can vouch that these individual attributes are most definitely appreciated and entertaining to experience. Even the product placement (which I am not generally fond of in film, though understand its use) is so appropriately implemented that even a sceptic can appreciate its presence. <br/><br/>If Disney were to instigate a consumer guarantee that stated any audience member may have their money back if they failed to in some way, shape or form, be entertained by Wreck-It Ralph, I can almost assure that the volume of tickets returned to theatre desks would fewer than the amount of times my eyes diverted their attention away from the screen the film was presented on (do note that I did not look away once). Despite quite useless use of 3D (as in 99% of films), the colourful and developing animated aesthetic absorbs your mind throughout, and you leave with the desire to play a video game, or watch the film again; either is likely to entertain. There are only brief nitpicks to mention in relation to Wreck-It Ralph, as for the overwhelming majority of the film, you have a great amount of fun. The protagonist's relationship with the main supporting character is one that is inevitable and frankly cute to see occur. Yet the transition from their annoyance to adoration for one another could have been developed further, to make it more convincing. In addition, the humour is an unfortunate element due to its elementary reservation, though I am just being too critical and will stop typing because overall Wreck-It Ralph is a fantastically pleasurable animated film."

","PLOT: An arcade video game character known as Wreck-It Ralph becomes disappointed with his life and that he is always known as a ""bad guy"". He decides to leave his game and jump between other titles in order to win a medal and return to his game a hero.<br/><br/>MY THOUGHTS: What drew me into this film the most was the fact that its story is one of the most creative and original ideas I have ever seen in a movie like this. It was done really well and made it feel like there is really a living, breathing world behind all those arcade screens.<br/><br/>PROS/CONS: The movie was very well done. Its very colourful and the fact that it takes place in various different video game worlds keeps its fresh and interesting as you watch. The only nitpick I may have is that it spent too much of its run time in ""Candy Rush"" (a candy land style racing game). In my opinion, too much time and it made me want him to jump to even more games.<br/><br/>RATING: 8/10"

That is how his adventure begins. In that amazing adventure he meets that cute little girl, he meets a different Felix and discovers an awesome side of life he was totally unaware of. His adventure leads him to various twists, presented him with innumerable obstacles. But Ralph with his goodness of heart and ""stinkiest brain of all"" overcomes all. At last he realizes the truth. He does not need any medal to prove he is good. To win the hearts of his friends, to be there when needed is all that matters. That is the real challenge, that is the real game. <br/><br/>The relationship between Ralph and the cute glitch reminds me about another touching animation ""Monster Inc."".

It entertained me thoroughly and did it right.<br/><br/>If you're one of those who pick faults with everything, I have no time for you, I found no fault in this movie.

Although it will get compared to Brave, that's a relatively normal cartoon by comparison, having only a strong girl character to justify any arguments.<br/><br/>The story still centers on video games and Ralph's wrecking fists, but it's the development of ""Glitch"" into a character comparable to Monsters, Inc.'s Boo after about 5 years of growing and a move to an arcade that makes the story more than just some retro video game amusement. It would still be a fun film, but Glitch turns it into a film that should be considered for awards beyond just animation. In some ways, it's a WALL-E prequel.<br/><br/>Besides Monsters, Inc., other less known great cartoon films with girl characters among the best ever include My Neighbor Totoro and Nausicaa, both of which are even slightly better than this."

"dfle3","8","1","1","14 February 2013"," Amusing with some nostalgia value. 77.5%
","It's hard to imagine who this movie is pitched at, as most of the humour arises from nostalgia for old video games which the target audience (children) would no doubt be ignorant of. In the cinema, I can't say that I heard a lot of reaction from the children watching this movie (which isn't to say that they didn't enjoy it...maybe they did). If you haunted amusement arcades back in the day or played on old consoles, then you should have fun with this movie...you just might have to convince your children (or grandchildren!) that there's something in it for them!<br/><br/>The movie's premise is like that of ""Toy story""...an animated cast of characters from video games come alive when the arcade closes and lead an independent life. I did get a laugh out of things like a big exclamation mark appearing over one character's head...a pop cultural reference I am sure would go over the heads of the young viewers in the audience (from the ""Metal gear solid"" series of games).<br/><br/>There was one scene which made me enquire what rating the movie had...there's a scene where a zombie character has his heart literally ripped out by another character and paraded briefly, like a trophy. This was the only moment when I was aware of the audience reaction...it was pretty much along the lines of ""Ewww!"". The movie is rated ""PG"" in Australia, which I suppose might be reasonable. Since no small children were obviously scarred for life by this scene, maybe I am just being too concerned about the 'appropriateness' of such content in this movie?<br/><br/>Themes in this movie are good food for the target audience (children) to chew over...overcoming other people's perceptions or expectations for you; self-belief; the value of duty; trust; ulterior motives; assigned roles etc. The titular character in this movie has to deal with some of these issues...in a video game is 'the bad guy'...the one who destroys things. He'd like to be the good guy for once so enters other games in order to achieve this.<br/><br/>Eventually it dawned on me that one of the voice cast for this movie was ""Ken"" from the sitcom ""30 Rock"" (Jack McBrayer).<br/><br/>The female character of ""Glitch"" was one who I found engaging and she also has to deal with some of those themes I outlined above...she's something of interest for young female viewers no doubt...although one of her jokes at the end of the movie did seem quite dark too!<br/><br/>Since I am most familiar with the older games represented in this movie (not that I necessarily played them or was a fan of them), I can't say that I know if there are any new game characters which would be known to a young audience and hence give them a reason to take a particular interest in this movie.<br/><br/>There is some product placement in the movie...I mean, apart from the obvious use of characters who feature in these old arcarde or video games.<br/><br/>As an adult, this movie appealed to me, hence the good score."

Some say it has a dip in the middle, but I disagree. Without losing any of Disney's sentimental touch, the film moves along very nicely through flamboyant colours and excellent (gaming) worlds and leads to a very fulfilling, if somewhat predictable ending, but there is a nice twist thrown in, just to spice things up. Overall, it's a film that manages to take a brilliant idea and do a lot with it. Of course, you have the standard morals and emotion linked with any Disney film, but that's the whole point.

","A video game villain (John C. Reilly) wants to be a hero and sets out to fulfill his dream, but his quest brings havoc to the whole arcade where he lives.<br/><br/>I am going to go out on a limb here and say this was the best animated feature of 2012. While I enjoyed ""Frankenweenie"" and ""ParaNorman"" and think ""Pirates"" is deserving of recognition, this film just won my heart. I have not seen ""Brave"" yet, but have my doubts that it can compete on this level.<br/><br/>The story is automatically a winner, as it has a bad guy -- who is bad through no fault of his own -- trying to be good. That is a great concept, and could raise interesting moral questions (which I will not do here). But they went the extra mile here and actually included real video games characters -- how they were able to get the rights is beyond me, but they did. And they threw in video game humor which was not necessary for the film to be a success, but will make various fans smile and nod (the ""World of Warcraft"" reference is over my head, but I liked the ""Zero Wing"" and ""Portal"" jokes).<br/><br/>What makes the animation here special, perhaps more special than other cartoons, is that they had to incorporate so many styles and create mini worlds. From the 8-bit world of Ralph, to the first-person shooter to the elaborate Candy Rush... this must have taken some time and more than a small share of creativity. If a game has not already been developed based on this film, it seems only natural -- the groundwork has already been done.<br/><br/>Does Vanellope von Schweetz count as a Disney princess? Probably not -- but I think she should."

There is a reference to this gamesaur in the movie. And many other references to well known and less known video games. There are also references to many other movies like Tron, Toy Stories, Cars and even Alien. Across space. I don't only mean that many video games have been produced in Eastern Asia, but also that video games have had an international diffusion and some of them are now icons, like Pacman or Mario Bros.<br/><br/>The plot is quite conventional: the strength of this movie is in details, many many details which made me wishing to watch it once again."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD! I went into Wreck-It Ralph having only seen the teaser trailer, and only knowing that it had video game characters and was about video games. I don't watch a lot of TV, so I didn't see any other advertisements for it, and had no idea what the story was, I just figured it'd be an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>What I was greeted to, after the stellar Disney Animations short ""Paperman"", was an amazing, heartwarming, hilarious, original, and adorable movie. From the first minute I was taken in, with the video game characters having their own lives outside of the games (a la Toy Story), and the ability to transfer to other games as well (which was done quite cleverly). We also meet our main character Wreck-It Ralph, who is tired of being the villain and being alone in the junk yard, and after some comical villain meetings and an encounter with the civilians of his game, he embarks on a quest to become a hero. After invading another game to begin his quest and getting a hold of the Hero medal, Ralph quickly ends up falling into a situation which may end not only his own game (due to his lack of presence), but another's as well In this game he meets the outcast Vanellope, a sweet, ambitious, racer who is claimed by all the others in her game ""Sugar Rush"", to be merely a glitch in the game, and they make fast friends as Ralph has to help her win the race to get his medal back, which she used to enter the race and become known as more than in a glitch. In the mean time, Fix-It Felix and Calhoun (from the game Ralph invaded) set out to find Ralph and the dangerous enemy he unleashed, threatening the entire arcade.<br/><br/>The story is solid, the performances from our cast our mint, and the characters are lovable and enjoyable (at least those that are supposed to be) The small little shout outs to follow arcade games, like Pac-Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, and more! I did not see the 3-D version (which in my opinion is pointless and gimmicky, plus I'm not capable of seeing the 3-D so I'm also biased towards 2-D) but the film remained just as good in the 2-D showing, there were no obvious gimmicks (at least none so obvious that it distracted me from the film and made any impact on my memory after wards), and furthermore the fact that this film was mistaken (and sometimes still is) for a Pixar film, just shows the quality of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, one of my favorite films of this year! 10/10: Not a single complaint on my end. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly suggest you do!"

I have played games for over 25 years so I understand the world of games and I know all the characters from the movie. I knew I was going to like this movie from the start but I did not know I was going to like it this much! This movie is more then just about games. The story is just so good that you really do not need to know about games to love it.

"michael11391","10","1","1","5 November 2012"," One of the most adorable & enjoyable animated flicks to come along in a long time.
","One of the most enjoyable & adorable animated flicks i've seen. First off, this could have easily been a Pixar film. It had that feel to it, storytelling, characters & short before the movie ""Paperman"", which was one of the best animated shorts i've seen. I loved the hell out of that short. Terrfic vocal performances from the actors. John C. Reilly is excellent as Ralph. Jane Lynch is great as Sgt. Calhoun. Alan Tudyk is awesome as King Candy. Jack McBrayer is one of biggest highlights here, giving an enjoyable & hilarious vocal performance as Fix-It Felix.<br/><br/>The best actor of the lot belongs to Sarah Silverman who gives one of her best if not the best performance of her movie career. I'm a fan of Silverman's (weirdly), I weirdly like hearing every single crazy thing that pops out of her mind that also comes out of her mouth. She has that ""Kewpie doll"" personality and puts it all on the line with the character Vanellope. Just a very adorable, very cute & lovable character voiced brilliantly by Silverman. I've always wanted the Oscars to have a animated vocal performance category, had they done that, I would immediately just give the Oscar to Sarah, period.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is hands down, adorable, funny, action-packed, entertaining & well-made. I'm a video gamer (of course, PS1, PS2, PS3, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Gamecube & Gameboy), I used to play arcade but not anymore. Brings out nostalgia & all gamers will easily get pleased (like me) with this. This is a just a good, old-fashion hopefully Oscar-winning animated movie."

","Well, i didn't know what to expect from this movie, knowing that Disney was behind the production of this video game animation, the game references were awesome.. BUT: <br/><br/>****---Some Spoilers----****** <br/><br/>The scenarios that they choose were bad, the ""sugar rush"" machine from the movie was the main scenario, why? i don't get it.. they just showed a couple of spoiled brats racing, and the main character in that video game is also a spoiled brat who turns into a princess (Vanellope).<br/><br/>Now back to the main story: Ralph is the ""bad guy"" in the video game wreck it Ralph, he lives in the trash, he is ugly and and his mouth breath stinks (Vanellope reminds him this a lot), he doesn't want to be the bad guy.. so he tries to socialize with the other characters in the video game, a couple of rich people living in a building that don't want him to come near because he doesn't ""belong"" there, you see a lot of stereotypes in this animation. At the end the accepts his ""fate""and tries to be happy getting thrown of the top of the building... knowing that without him the video game couldn't be possible, so the message that you get is ""follow your role of life, even if someone is abusing you.. that's just the way life is."""
"davidchume","5","5","12","29 December 2015"," Wrecked Potential
","I recently saw Wreck-It Ralph as part of a long marathon of ""age appropriate"" movies for my nieces and nephews over the Christmas season. Contrary to my expectations, many of the children's movies were surprisingly good or even great as movies in their own right. On the other hand, movies like Wreck-It Ralph are exactly what I expected.<br/><br/>While the premise is solid, the scenario is poorly plotted, the foreshadowing is weak, the characters are under-developed, the gags are not funny for either children or young adults, and the film ends without ever really delivering any kind of message or exploring a theme.<br/><br/>There are severe pacing issues. The introduction overstays its welcome. Exposition is delivered at the wrong times making certain elements of the story annoying rather than mysterious. It fails to execute on the level of UP, Wall-E, the Lego Movie, or anything else I saw during the marathon. Actually, the botched execution is noteworthy-- there are scenes with so much unrealized potential.<br/><br/>It could be praised for never relying on jokes that go above the heads of children, unfortunately, they just are not good jokes.<br/><br/>I highly recommend you avoid ordering this if you're looking for some family friendly movie that everyone will enjoy. This is a much better movie for the ""stare at TV entranced without understanding the words"" crowd, and even then, some of the visual direction is likely to lose interest."
"khfan250","8","3","6","2 November 2012"," A ""Roger Rabbit"" for the Gaming Generation
","So I was not the biggest fan of the trailers for Wreck-It Ralph. Even though I liked the small appearances from classic video game characters, I wasn't riding the train of ""this movie will be awesome"" because I'm not a John C. Reilly fan and definitely not a Sarah Silverman fan. But after finally seeing it, I thought it was really good.<br/><br/>The best part of Wreck-It Ralph is the first half of the movie. In fact, it's flawless. The writing, characters, and animation is all perfect. I found myself laughing quite a few times (which I rarely do in a kid's movie) and having a lot of fun!<br/><br/>One of the best elements of the movie is the character if Ralph, which is weird, because I don't really care for John C. Reilly. But he was a really good and likable guy. And the filmmakers know that, despite the fact that this is a movie filled with video game characters that everyone knows and loves, they need to keep the focus on him. <br/><br/>These video game characters are more like cameos. They work very similarly to how the toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit worked; they definitely have some of the best laughs in the movie and are a lot of fun, but they never pull focus from the story or the main character.<br/><br/>Okay, so I've praised this movie so much that you're probably wondering why it has an 8 instead of a 10. Well, the movie sort of loses gravity as soon as Ralph enters a game called Sugar Rush. He meets a little glitch named Vanellope, played by Sarah Silverman, who dreams of becoming a racer. But King Candy, played by the very charismatic Alan Tudyk, forbids her from racing because she is a glitch in the game. Everyone taunts her, but despite all of this, Ralph and Vanellope form an unusual bond.<br/><br/>And you can pretty much guess the rest of the movie from there. They race, defeat the bad guy, and Vanellope is crowned a princess. But, if that wasn't predictable enough, there are more plot points going on involving bugs, a jealous video game character, and a silly, but hilarious, romance between two side characters. All of these elements work, I guess, but it becomes just a little too complicated along the ride. It's not horrible, in fact it's not even that bad, it's just not handled as well as the first half was.<br/><br/>Final verdict: I would recommend anyone, young or old, gamer or not, to see Wreck It Ralph. It has wonderful animation, great characters, and some great laughs. Yeah, I wish the second half was a bit more polished, but this movie was still a lot of fun. In fact, I think this is the most fun I've had in a theater since The Avengers in May, which is saying a lot."
"shadow147-288-516186","4","6","16","4 January 2013"," Disney respect the video-games, but do not know what to do whit them
","Wreck-It Ralph<br/><br/>With a great idea Rich Moore creates a very fun and well thought world of video-games, whom characters in the night, when the arcades are close, go by the electric system to visit each other and live lives there are no much different then ours after leaving work. Put in that great world we have a villain who is tired of his life and wants to be loved like a hero. Ralph, after the bet that him could not get a medal, travels to other games and brakes every thing in his way, that obsession get the viewer tired and shows that Ralph in fact is a shallow character that wants to break the system just because he is tired of being ignored by the little fellows in his game. The art direction is beautiful respecting all the elements and history of video games, like when the characters that live in a 8-bit game moves in a robotic way and when the main character of Ralph's game jump, you can hear to the nostalgic sound that we all know. Its a shame that whit all that potential in the movie to attract the first generation of gamers all the way till his sons, Wreck-it Ralph give us a very childish screenplay and characters, with a crude humor that do not make the grown ups laugh and do not give the child an memorable comedy. In the end when Venellope says that she is not a princess and that she knows her place, she is very right because her place is not whit the old princess of Disney, but in a childhood easy to forgot."
"strong-122-478885","6","3","7","15 July 2014"," Hey, He's Bad, And, Yep, That's Good!
","If the Wreck-It Ralph character were, in fact, a real man he'd be 9 feet tall and approx. 640 lb. (And, of course, with the way that Ralph was built you could clearly see that his body weight was largely concentrated in his big, muscular arms and his humongous, concrete-crushing hands) <br/><br/>Generally speaking, this CG-animated, fantasy, kiddies' picture was, for the most part, actually entertaining enough (depending, of course, on one's frame of mind) to be of some worthwhile amusement for an adult audience, as well.<br/><br/>To say that the candy-sparkled, rainbow-coloured brilliance of this film's animation was, at times, a wildly dazzling delight would truly be an understatement.<br/><br/>Once the action in the story shifted over into the kiddie world of ""Sugar Rush"", this film quickly accelerated into a vision of psychedelic eye-candy equivalent to that of a drug-free LSD trip.<br/><br/>Though this $165 million production did manage to hold my interest, it certainly wasn't without its flaws and annoyances.<br/><br/>When it came to this zany, yet quite likable, cartoon losing some points, here are 4 of my main beefs.<br/><br/>(1) The Wreck-It Ralph character didn't do nearly enough ""wrecking"" to satisfy my expectations of his overall power.<br/><br/>(2) With its 100-minute running time, this film seriously needed about 20 minutes worth of its story skillful edited out.<br/><br/>(3) The female ""Sergeant Calhoun"" character (with her mean, hair-trigger temper) was such an annoying butch-broad that she put all of the male characters to literal shame with her overbearing masculinity.<br/><br/>(4) I really resented the deliberate product placement of the ""Subway"" logo which was blatantly foisted into my face at Mr. Litwak's Arcade."
"rjsf96","6","3","7","18 February 2013"," OK, but over hyped by critics
","Wreck-it Ralph has a familiar feel, similar in tone to the Toy Story films, as in this instead of the toys having their own personalities the video game characters do. It tells the story of Ralph who is tired of being bad. Day in and day out he wrecks Fix-it Felix's house which Felix has to (guess what) fix! Following this he tries to get himself a medal and recognition for once. The trouble is only heroes get medals and Ralph is considered the villain from the game that he is from. This leads to Ralph to try and get a medal from someone else's video game.<br/><br/>The concept is brilliant. The possibilities seem endless. However, the way it goes about it isn't. You can't help feeling that they could have used popular video games as a basis for the movie. Yet we only get fleeting appearances of characters like Sonic. No main roles are given for characters such as these only cameos.<br/><br/>To be fair the first half hour of the film is breath taking. So much so that I was under the impression (for half an hour) that this would be a flawless film as lush visuals fill the screen and immerse you in the world Disney has created. Ralph enters a first person shooter which is a strange form for the story to take yet it works incredibly well. It is a different move for Disney altogether.<br/><br/>After this sequence (that is highly reminiscent of the Alien franchise) things take a turn for the worse as Disney takes a back to basics approach that is highly formulaic and only kids will love the next hour. He enters a racing video game that feels girlish and has a pink tinge to its surroundings. Too much of this has a, been there done that feel and makes the film less enjoyable to watch. For the majority of the film being set here it is a let-down and you can't help feeling numerous locations would have helped rather than being stranded in this world for nearly an hour.<br/><br/>Some elements are good though. The character of Ralph is highly likable and one that you can feel for. (Fix-it Felix is quite poor in comparison). His emotions are understandable and it makes it easier to relate to how he is feeling. There are also never ending references to popular video game characters, which make it impossible to view all by watching it once.<br/><br/>One final point, the 3D is excellent. The animation pops out at you from the start and engulfs you in a rainbow of colour. The animators have worked there magic here and can be praised as doing a fine job throughout the entire film. It helps that Disney have decided on an unlimited colour palette which feels reminiscent of Pixar. Just don't expect as much depth as it in terms of story and excitement.<br/><br/>Verdict: Although still a good film, Wreck-it Ralph is noticeably not as polished as Pixar's offerings. It does not enter the same league as the Toy Story films or even some of Disney's previous like Aladdin and Hercules. Don't be fooled by critics rave reviews, Wreck-it Ralph is not a masterpiece nor is it a bad film it just ranks somewhere in between. There are lush visuals aplenty here, just lack of an entertaining glued to the seat story. If considering watching go to the cinema with fairly low expectations and you may be pleasantly surprised. If you don't you may feel let down by the high standards of Disney's previous outings.<br/><br/>6 Out of 10"
"MissSimonetta","8","2","4","24 February 2015"," Miraculously less popular than Frozen
","While Disney's Frozen (2013) is still being shoved in our faces almost two years after its release, Wreck-It-Ralph (2012) has been shamefully tossed aside. A great shame, since this is one of the finest films of Disney's so-called ""Revival Period."" <br/><br/>The animation is so creative in how it emulates a multitude of video game aesthetic styles, from the colorful and block-like 8-bit to the high-definition games of today. Everything is vibrant and pleasing to the eye. The many settings run the gamut of video game history: the arcade game, kart racing, first-person shooters, among others. I do so hope they make a sequel, because there's just so much more they could explore with this world.<br/><br/>The cast make up one of the most memorable casts in Disney history. Ralph's character development is excellent; he goes from being a sullen outcast to a selfless hero, while still possessing charisma and pathos throughout. Vanellope, at first annoying, is fleshed out through the revelation of her back story and her growing friendship with Ralph. Felix and Calhoun are both unlikely sources of comic relief and romance. The villain is revealed via plot twist, and let me tell you, it's much better handled than a similar twist in Frozen.<br/><br/>The resolution is happy with a touch of bitter sweetness, unexpected from what seems to be just another family comedy. I admit I cried, something I thought no modern Disney film could ever prompt me to do.<br/><br/>Seriously Disney, I rarely ask this but make a sequel! This is a great concept with great characters. If you've not seen it, then don't miss out!"

","A great film, almost a film that did not have a princess.. A fairly original film in setting with a good soundtrack and solid characters, the the interaction between Ralph and Penelope are really special and often don't come to surface like this in so called Disney 'family films'. I loved the design and the film actually felt like the crew that made it enjoyed being on the project, it feels rare but Disney of the past was small cubicles and corporate doctrine, they feel very indie in this one particular film with their direction and choice of themes, I think they got a free ride on game culture in general being a large mash-up to draw inspiration from to begin with, very re-watchable and film that stands apart from the usual Disney offerings."
"bob the moo","Null","2","4","17 February 2013"," Retro-cool points for sure, but needed more laughs and more heart
","""It's the new Pixar film"" I said to my partner, as we sat to watch this film recently, although it didn't take me long to realize that while Disney may own Pixar now, this isn't to say that they can suddenly produce films that have made that studio so very successful. Wreck-It Ralph has the high-concept idea and shades of Toy Story in its ""alive when the lights go out"" motif, but it is disappointingly light in most things after this has settled in. The plot sees a villain in a video game setting out to be a good guy in other games so that he can return home with a prize to prove it and thus be accepted by his fellow characters.<br/><br/>On the face of it the film has the potential to be emotional, moving and funny and you can see that it is aiming for the Pixar mould, but it just gets lost in its own plotting and forgets to do the key things well. There is a lot going on here ‚Äì villains, glitches, a quest for a medal, a quest for a race, a quest to get Ralph back etc etc. All of the plotting takes time and offers little in return. The key thing for me though is that it simply isn't funny or fun enough; it has a few chuckles but nothing more than that. The characters and the jokes are pretty obvious ‚Äì even the casting is easy to predict (for example the big joke around Sarah Silverman and McBrayer is that they are the characters we already know them to be in adult world). It is an adventure and will distract kids, but the laughs are too far between. The cool points are there from the start though ‚Äì the 8-bit graphics, the gamer in-jokes and references, but they mostly aren't clever so much as just done and this gets old quite quickly. It is a film badly in need of genuine heart and warmth but this never comes either; we get sentimentality and moments like this but nothing real or actually moving.<br/><br/>This is across the story, across the characters and across the jokes. It still gets cool points and it still has its moments but it is disappointingly lacking in wit and heart, leaving a lot of noise and adventure but nothing more than that. Worth a look but it doesn't even get close to the Pixar films that represent the high water mark to which it clearly aspires."

","This is definitely one of the very best animated movies I've ever seen in modern times, and the reviews already make that clear. What I see in this movie that others haven't brought up is that it's a great story for fathers, despite not having any actual fatherhood in the story. The personal struggles of Ralph throughout the movie and as he meets the other main character are a pretty good reflection of what it's like to become a dad. Mixed emotions, uncertainty about one's place after a long time in the same path, making all kinds of mistakes--it's basically all there. In a society where women are valued and men are disposable, this story does a great job of showing off the humanity behind the social expectations of masculinity. It's heartwarming to see the growth of a flawed outcast as he finds his place in society, learns how to change his weaknesses into strengths, learns to rely on others to help him with what he can't accomplish on his own, and becomes a positive influence on others as he finds his own happiness.<br/><br/>I've narrowly dodged dropping spoilers so that you can see what I'm talking about for yourself if you haven't already watched this movie.

"renegadeviking-271-528568","8","0","0","4 February 2020"," Wreck it Ralph review
","Wreck-It Ralph takes place inside the games and the central surge protector of a thriving video arcade, and its main ""hero"" is initially anything but: Ralph, a giant of a man who is the building-damaging bad guy of Fix-It Felix, Jr.. That game's actual protagonist is as simple as the villain: Felix takes his hammer, climbs the residential building, and repairs all the windows Ralph breaks. But even though this has been going on for as many decades as his game has been plugged in, Ralph doesn't want to be a bad guy, and he most certainly doesn't want to be maligned as one, at least not while Felix is getting medals, pies, and pats on the back for doing-as Ralph does-only what he is designed and programmed to do.<br/><br/>Free will does exist within this setting, however, and Ralph confesses his life doubts in a support meeting of various video-game villains including a talking zombie, Kano from Mortal Kombat (who rips out said zombie's heart), Zangief from Street Fighter II (remember that the Soviet Union still existed when that game came out), Bowser from various Mario games, one of the Pac-Man ghosts, and many more. It's a hilarious piece of video-gaming fan service that doesn't add anything to the plot and doesn't need to.
Wreck-It Ralph ""Bad-Anon"" meeting<br/><br/>Especially not when ridiculously hilarious moments like this exist.<br/><br/>Sneaking a cherry out of Pac-Man, Ralph embarks on his journey toward heroism in fits and starts: he gives part of it to a destitute Q*Bert, whose game has been unplugged, leaving him a homeless beggar occupying the arcade surge protector, which itself is a sort of transit hub between games. Ralph gets no reward, and Felix gets a party and a fireworks show. Wanting to make amends and to find out how to gain respect, Ralph crashes said party and at least tries to be nice. There's an uneasy peace among the partygoers, but unfortunately few if any of them believe in Ralph's ability to become a noble human being. His clumsiness and anger-management issues wreck the party, but he's already begun to establish himself in a sympathetic light.
Hero's Duty<br/><br/>With some hilarious references to Mario and even to Tapper (the root-beer variant, though this isn't immediately obvious) and Metal Gear, Ralph has a chance meeting with a heavily armed and armored super-soldier whose game shares its title with this heading and can be played here. Ralph wants to earn a medal of heroism in someone's game, even if he can't do so in his own, so still being in part a bad guy, Ralph steals the man's arms and armor and runs off to Hero's Duty. This is a bug-fighting rail shooter that somewhat evokes Area 51 or Time Crisis, and its no-nonsense main character, Sergeant Calhoun, leads her semi-competent fighting force through a pretty epic fight sequence where cyborg insects get splattered by the dozens. It should definitely be noted that while most of her dialogue is clean, there's a really weird ""pussywillows"" insult that seems to cross a line of taste in a children's movie.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph - Hero's Duty<br/><br/>While not highly original, the art design could sustain its own story universe. Sergeant Calhoun is centered.<br/><br/>Running around in advanced armor without any special training, Ralph's interference in another game means that he isn't around when someone wants to play his own. Felix and his community are utterly confused by Ralph's absence, and a girl trying but failing to play Fix-It Felix, Jr. complains, resulting in the game being marked as ""out of order."" If it is not fixed, it will be unplugged, making all of the game's inhabitants homeless.<br/><br/>Ralph's heroic journey almost feels like a deconstruction of such, because while his intentions can be praised, his means of fulfilling them put everyone around him at risk. Game-hopping (""going Turbo,"" a phrase repeated too often in the story before it's properly explained) is possible in the movie's arcade setting but is generally treated cynically, because while these virtual people have lives of their own behind the scenes, they also have jobs they are expected to be present for. In other words, when Felix and Sergeant Calhoun become involved in finding Ralph and undoing the damage he's largely unintentionally caused, their absence from their games puts them on a strict time limit. Interestingly, the various game characters affect their games' input-output systems as much as the reverse is true: when Felix panics and begins moving around on his own, the arcade unit's joystick moves erratically.<br/><br/>Sugar Rush<br/><br/>Ralph winds up in a candy-coated sweet tooth's paradise that holds its own go-kart races, wherein his inspirationally established and rather self-aware quest to help a little girl win a race becomes much more complicated than they or anyone else in the movie would have imagined. Vanellope von Schweetz is an extremely energetic individual who, like Ralph to a degree, is looking for her proper place in the world. Unfortunately some of the other girls in Sugar Rush bully her, and some of their insults-fake convulsions that are relevant because of Vanellope's contested status as a ""glitch"" character-could be interpreted as their also making fun of epileptic symptoms.<br/><br/>Felix and Sergeant Calhoun, now in this setting, begin to become more interesting individuals, if to different extents: while the normally carefree Felix becomes angry at Ralph but doesn't generally change who he is as a person, Sergeant Calhoun (whom other characters note has been programmed with a tragic backstory) is deeply affected by said tragedy, which still gives her emotional triggers and flashbacks; the poor girl's past is definitely not something that's brought up once and never mentioned again, and it's easy to see how this experience affects her personality and her interactions with other people. Wreck-It Ralph never becomes difficult to follow, but with nearly half a dozen main characters and multiple plots, including an actual villain's, happening at once, it's a wonder and a compliment that the movie remains as consistently understandable as it does.
Wreck-It-Ralph - Ralph and Vanellope<br/><br/>Yes, it's adorable.<br/><br/>A training montage for Vanellope's go-kart race (which features the Rihanna song ""Shut Up and Drive,"" whose oft-repeated title some parents may not want their children repeating) is fun to watch, because even though Wreck-It Ralph is not a Pixar film, the graphics, animation, and even camera angles are all very high-quality, making this quite possibly the only film I actively regret not yet having seen in 3D. This scene is also enjoyable because Ralph gets to place his bulk and strength toward a positive use. There are no throwaway action sequences in the film, such as with the bug fights; those happen when they are needed to advance the plot, and as a result, their outcomes tend to be very creative.<br/><br/>The story goes into really engrossing territory when it introduces shades of gray into its morality. Ralph at one point is faced with an unenviable greater-good decision, and the choices he makes, while logical in context, hurt another character's feelings in a scene that's utterly heartbreaking to watch. It's been years since I've seen a children's film being willing to deal with these kinds of emotional themes without feeling manipulative, and it's rare that I've seen this done so well.
Conclusion: This could stand with the best of Pixar's own works.<br/><br/>Other than some toilet humor (including an uncomfortable if restrained amount of fake profanity, such as telling one character to ""move his molasses""), an unnecessary scene playing female-on-male physical abuse (even if well-intended and consensual) for laughs, a cheesy romance, and a ridiculously catchy song in the ingeniously designed closing credits, Wreck-It Ralph is a marvelously designed work of animation that deserves to be watched again and again. It's the best video-game movie not at its time based on an actual video game I can recall seeing (sorry, TRON-which, by the way, has a great reference during the credits, as do many arcade games), and it's a story that places its characters first and manages to keep all of them interesting no matter how much they change over the course of the plot.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is, above all, a movie that knows when to be fun and serious and is equally adept at being either. The ""hero's"" transition to being such feels believable and never forced, the villain feels credible and legitimately evil, and the setting looks like a lot of fun to live in, even if some sequences (including one where having one's game unplugged is established as a fatal event) could honestly be a bit scary for young children. While some events such as a character having his armor stolen feel a bit overlooked in the grand scheme of the plot, the story and its ending are satisfying and even heartwarming. Likewise, while there's a lot going on, none of it feels random or irrelevant, and the movie's conclusion feels creative while also being logical."

","Wreck-It-Ralph is a fun, cute film with heart. The retro-style and pop culture references feel quite natural since the film is based around a video game.
The characters are lovable and quite deep. The animation isn't anything too incredible, but it's still good.
I think the concept of having 2 plots worked pretty well in this film, and both plots intertwined naturally in the end.
When Ralph is falling down to the volcano and is giving the monologue about how he is a bad guy, but he is still good, it kind of contradicts itself since he says ""I will never be good and that's not bad"" but he is in the middle of doing something really good. It seemed like a cheesy way to get an emotional reaction, however this film is still a great one, and very possibly will go down as a Disney Classic."

"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","0","11 November 2018"," Wreck-It Ralph wrecks your screen with vivid pixels, polygons and plenty of heart.
","Leave it to Disney to produce an animation hosting one of the largest character rosters all from different intellectual properties, and yet not concede to obvious product placements. I see Sonic the Hedgehog in all of his ""you're too slow!"" glory, but never once feel persuaded to go out, buy the game and rage quit after failing Green Hill Zone Act 1. The focus is completely on Ralph's story. A villain from an arcade game grows tired of being the bad guy, and so drifts off into other games in order to prove that he can be the hero. However in doing so, his game risks being decommissioned, jeopardising the characters' lives in the process. It's a relatively simple story, an individual finding their purpose and not wanting to conform to their programmed design. Ralph's development is the most engrossing aspect of this film. Yes, the animation is gorgeous and fluid, as if playing 'Hero's Duty' at 60fps and in 4K. And yes, the voice acting is unsurprisingly fitting for all characters, particularly Reilly and Silverman. But the amount of natural change in Ralph as the film progresses is quite extraordinary. It's to be expected, however it irrefutably makes him an endearing character. As I mentioned earlier, intellectual properties can be spotted in every corner. Q*bert, Sonic, Bowser and a plethora of other famous creations, roam around the hub world acting as simple easter eggs for retro video game fans. Never once utilised to progress the story, just environmental details. It works as sufficient world building. The narrative structure however is somewhat fractured, with arcade games acting as genre shifts. 'Hero's Duty' provides the action, whereas 'Sugar Rush' enhances the story's sweetness. These shifts disable a lack of narrative flow, splitting the story up into different segments. The antagonist also felt unnecessary, and forcibly had a backstory just to quantify a plot twist. Still, another creative addition to Disney's animated resurgence. 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' for the new generation."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","0","21 August 2018"," Fun and engaging animation rich in comedy; adventure and dregrees of nostalgia.
","I am just about old enough to remember arcades and arcade machines themselves - there was an ""Outrun"" situated beside a ""Michael Jackson's Moonwalker"" near the reception desk of my local sports and leisure centre back in the mid 90's. Upstairs, in another the corridor, there was a ""Pac-Man"" game. On one particular holiday, an outlet known as 'SegaWorld' was situated not five minutes away around the corner of a hotel we were staying at. This was the only real video gaming arcade I think I ever visited: it was a vast, open gaming utopia of bleeping noises; flashing lights and huge screens. Shooting games would have in-built guns pointing at the screen, driving games (""Daytona USA"") would allow you to sit behind a wheel and actually simulate driving around the track. I distinctly recall being wowed by the fact multiple people could engage in the same race at once on different screens. That sounded like the most fun anyone could ever have doing anything.<br/><br/>Not very long after all of this, Sony released their first 'Playstation' console and there was not, I do not think, really a reason to go back to arcades - I strain to recall going back to one after having obtained a Playstation myself, and I distinctly recall the arcade machines at my local leisure centre having vanished certainly by 2000. I can only guess no one was playing them anymore - Sega and Nintendo of course had certain consoles out when arcades were much bigger, but Sony just seemed to have seen the arcade off for good. <br/><br/>All of which brings us to ""Wreck-it Ralph"", an actually quite infectious animation in the mould of ""Toy Story"", with spits and spots of ""Last Action Hero"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" thrown in for good measure, about video game characters who live in arcade machines and operate within their own little universe parallel to our own. Like ""Toy Story"", they have their own rules and regulations on keeping everything a secret - it's a little more serious in this film because if game characters start misbehaving too badly, their arcade machine is shut down and wheeled off thus terminating everybody in the game. 'Work' is to fulfil what your character is meant to do within the confines of a given game - ANY game - and then chilling out in the evening ready for the next day. Sometimes, they use electricity cables to traverse to communal places, or even one another's games.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly voices the eponymous Ralph, the villain in a fictitious arcade game from the 1980's entitled ""Fix-it Felix"", which still somehow manages to pull in the punters amidst all the cool new games. Ralph, however, wants change - he's tired of being the villain and is a little depressed on account of being rejected by the other characters in the 'Fix-it' game, whom will quite happily invite one of the Super Mario Brothers to a house-party, but never Ralph. <br/><br/>Going against all the rules, Ralph bolts from the game in search of a medal, which he believes will win him the appreciation of the game's other characters given his nemesis Felix is showered in them every day for winning the very game Ralph must attempt to thwart. Facing oblivion should Ralph not return, Felix (Jack McBrayer) converses with the other characters of ""Fix-it"" and decides to follow him into a game resembling a combination of ""Mario Kart"" and those candy themed levels from ""Mickey Mouse's Castle of Illusion"" so as to drag him back... Eventually, events unfold whereby Ralph is wrapped up in a mission that threatens much more than his mere popularity. <br/><br/>What is most impressive about the film is, aside from its dazzling visuals and really quite wonderful idea of creating a universe for video gaming characters to all co-exist, its sense of adventure and the careful characterisation it provides to an array of made-up video gaming entities, of whom cane be little; large; tough-talking; softly spoken; kooky; wacky and just plain homicidal - all of which creates a wonderful palette. Thrown in for good measure is a sweet romance sub-plot Felix has with a gun-toting action heroine from a ""Halo"" style shooter named Calhoun (Jane Lynch), which I assume was partly designed to highlight the progression female characters have undergone in video-games over three decades. <br/><br/>The film's director, Rich Moore, has a background in working with people like Matt Groening on ""Futurama"" and ""The Simpsons"", and so is more than adept at delivering fast-moving, joke-riddled cartoons which are often very funny and seem to be about complete nonsense, but actually have very carefully defined boundaries that keep them from being such a thing.<br/><br/>I think much of one's enjoyment of the film will derive from whether or not you can recall heading down to arcades and having a blast on a game, either with a friend or on your own. For many, those memories originate from childhood anyway and so there can be a really pleasing clash of nostalgia with the freshness of seeing an unseen adventure. The film is much more than mere visuals and effects, and certainly, the way everything is reigned in and brought together for the finale, is more than just slightly impressive. It isn't difficult to recommend ""Wreck-it Ralph""."

The narrative itself explores occasionally powerful themes of overcoming societal conformity, prejudice and generally just being better than you or anyone else ever thought possible. It's a vibrant, unique and exciting animation that's enjoyable throughout and hits all of its emotional beats surprisingly well.

"Tweekums","8","0","0","20 October 2017"," A villain is the hero of this enjoyable Disney animation
","This Disney animation isn't centred on a hero; its protagonist is the eponymous Wreck-It Ralph; the villain of the arcade game Fix-It Felix. While he lives alone in a dump while the other characters live in an apartment block¬Ö. After thirty years he has had enough. He is told he can live in the apartment block if he wins a medal; the problem is villains don't get medals. When the arcade shuts down for the night the game characters leave their games and hang out together; he bumps into Space Marine from the 'bug hunt' game 'Hero's Duty' and decides to take this character's place and win a medal there. He gets his medal but is immediately attacked by a bug; he gets into an escape pod, with the bug, and ends up in another game; 'Sugar Rush'. Here he meets Vanellope Von Schweetz, a glitchy character who steals his medal so she can use it to enter a race to become one of the game's official racers. Now if he wants his medal back Vanellope will have to win the race so Ralph starts helping her. There are a few problems though; his own game doesn't work without him; the bug he brought to Sugar Rush threatens to breed and destroy the game and if a glitch wins the race it could leave to the game being shut down.<br/><br/>At first glance this could be mistaken for 'Toy Story with video game characters' thankfully it takes the concept in interesting new directions. I liked having a 'designated villain' as the films protagonist and the way the characters switch between games was rather fun. Ralph is a solid protagonist, even if he is meant to be a villain it is clear that he is a good person at heart. Vanellope is a cute and fun female lead so there is a character for young boys and young girls to cheer for. The secondary characters are fun too; hard-as-nails Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun from Hero's Duty and Fix-It Felix are fun, if unlikely, couple and King Candy makes a good antagonist; especially when we learn the truth about him. There are plenty of references to real video games, some I spotted but I'm sure there were many I didn't recognised as I was never a gamer. The action scenes are impressive with some really good animation; there are also plenty of laughs to be had¬Ö some might be a little too scatological for some parents to approve of but I suspect those gags would have children laughing the most. The voice cast does a really good job bringing their characters to life in a way that doesn't sound overly cartoony¬Ö as one would expect from Disney of course. Overall this is a fun animation that can be enjoyed by all children and probably most adults; especially those who grew up playing classic arcade games."

","I wasn't particularly excited when I heard about wreck it Ralph. Now I've seen it I feel the same.<br/><br/>It seems throughout this film that Disney has lost confidence in itself. The film has a panicked thoroughness together feel about it. Rather than focus on plot and animation, it seems to try and be funny and fail. Now there are funny parts in it, and their are some truly hilarious bits, but for every joke they got right, there is a joke that falls flat. And unfortunately they stand out and have nowhere to hide.<br/><br/>The animation is OK, but not as good as either tangled and frozen (Disney's other 3d animated films). This wouldn't be so bad but it is a long way off either of them and thus falls flat. <br/><br/>But the biggest problem by a mile is the plot. Without giving away any spoilers I will just say it has a similar feel to despicable me or mega mind. Being the most recent of the three it feels a little recycled, and while the other two are strong compliments of each other, this is left in their dust.<br/><br/>Having said all that their are points to compliment this film on. In places it is truly hilarious, he idea of the characters being from various computer games is clever, and surprisingly this film does play a little on the emotions. There are moments of genuine heartbreak, something Disney has been afraid to try in recent years.<br/><br/>The saving grace of this film is glitch. ( she does have a really long real name but for he sake of the review I'll call her glitch.) for one she has a real expressive voice, also something Disney have failed in recent years. It's through her we get the real laughs so she does stand out. But it's her innocence, and her quite real struggles that is a stroke of genius. Seeing her befriend Ralph through a child's eyes and seeing him slowly being one over by her makes this film watchable. <br/><br/>To sum up. It's not a complete waste of time but a long way of classic"

Kids watching this will never know what bad graphic was, because they never had to experience that. Good/bad for them is what you could say. But even they won't hold it against this movie, especially because those sections are not that long.<br/><br/>Great comedy and good family entertainment movie."

","Taking a page out of the ""Toy Story"" book, ""Wreck It Ralph"" is about the characters that populated our childhood, and what they do when we're not watching. (Unlike Woody and Buzz, however, these guys don't give a darn if the kids who play with them like them or not. It's just a job.) Ralph is the bad guy in a video game titled ""Fix It Felix, Jr."" that occupies space in an old-fashioned arcade - the kind that actually took quarters and was managed by a guy wearing, for some mysterious reason, a referee's striped shirt.<br/><br/>When the arcade closes and the kids go home, the characters' lives go on. But Ralph doesn't have much of a life, because he's a bad guy, and everybody in his game hates him. The rest of the characters throw a party, but they don't invite Ralph. Instead, he goes to a Baddies Anonymous meeting, where he commiserates with Zangief (from ""Street Fighter"") and Bowser (from an endless number of ""Mario"" games) about how hard it is to be a bad guy. Zangief reminds him that ""just because you are Bad Guy, doesn't mean you are bad¬Öguy!"" Their motto as a group is ""I'm bad, and that's good."" The meeting doesn't help Ralph much, maybe because he's not the one that needs to hear it. What they really have is a PR problem; instead of sitting in an Anonymous meeting, these bad guys really should be taking their message to the streets.<br/><br/>Ralph decides he's going to win a medal, just like Felix does, and thus win the love and respect of the folks in his game. So he sneaks into a HALO-style first person shooter and steals the medal from the end, in the meanwhile setting off a chain of events that threaten the existence of the entire video game sub-world.<br/><br/>This all happens in the first half hour, and, if this were just an average movie, I would be able to guess the rest of the film at this point in it. Ralph would spend the next 60(ish) minutes trying to clean up the mess he'd made, and in the process, he would save the video game world, and at the end, just when he thinks of himself as a bad guy for real, everyone would see him as a hero and they would give him the medal he so badly wanted and tried to steal. <br/><br/>But this is a better, more interesting film than that. Ralph gets himself into trouble, and is plunged in to the candy-coated world of Sugar Rush, a go-kart racing game where nobody is quite what they seem. He loses his medal to a punk kid voiced by Sarah Silverman, and is forced into an agreement with her where if he helps her win a big race, she'll give him his medal back. But then King Candy, the ruler of Sugar Rush (voiced by Alan Tudyk, doing a spot-on and very entertaining impression of Ed Wynn from ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"") pulls him aside to explain that if the kid is allowed to win the race, it would spell doom for the entire game, as well as certain death for her. What's Ralph to do? <br/><br/>""Wreck It Ralph"" does an excellent job of layering its exposition, so that a seemingly throwaway comment in one scene suddenly becomes an important plot point ten or twenty minutes later. That's a pretty simple storytelling principle (though it's far too often ignored in Hollywood,) but what's really impressive is that these comments never feel like they're being dropped on purpose; it's never obvious that the screenwriters are telling us something we'll need to know later in the story. That takes talent, and it's on display here. ""Wreck It Ralph"" creates and inhabits a clearly unbelievable world, but it's written so well that it feels more believable, more lived in, than some movies that purport to exist in the real world. Contrast this, for instance with ""Looper;"" that movie did a lot of things right, but the hints it dropped were so clunky and obvious that they broke the illusion; I knew what was coming well before it came, and spent nearly the last half of the film bored.<br/><br/>Another of the things that I loved about this film was that both main characters' quest for actualization puts their respective worlds in jeopardy. When Ralph is absent from ""Fix It Felix, Jr."" the game can't function, and the real world owner of the arcade (the guy in the referee shirt) prepares to junk it. The punk kid (I've been avoiding her name, because it's such an unholy mouthful, but for the record, it's Vanellope Von Schweetz) feels in her bones that she's a racer, but following that impulse threatens to bring her whole world down around her ears. Their problems look like personal problems, but really, they're community problems; for both of them, the perspective of their entire community is going to need to shift before things can be restored to order and harmony.<br/><br/>That's an awfully academic paragraph about a kids' movie. But ""Wreck It Ralph"" isn't your run-of-the-mill kids' movie. It passed the kids' test in my house; my 4 year old likes it, though she thinks the bugs are too scary. I like it, too, because it offers something deeper, meatier and more nuanced for adult eyes. And I'm not just talking about the '80s video game references that go right over my pre schooler's head. This is one I won't mind watching over and over again."

I was at a friend's house to use his wifi when mine broke down and he had just bought the DVD. He played it and I was not interested the first minute then I was hooked! The movie is GENIUS Genius in story, story telling, script writing, switching between the world of the tiny characters, in between their little worlds, and then ""our"" world. The script is flawless.

Ralph decides to leave and get recognition in other community/games that he can not get in his own game. This is so true in real-world workplaces, people always jump out and in, trying to get higher salary and more respect. Skipping the long adventure Ralph had in other game, the ending is other citizens in Flex-fix-it recognize the importance of a role of a bad guy in a game and comes to appreciate his presence... and Ralph gets the recognition in his own game...

The storyline was pretty well thought out with bits and pieces of funny stuff thrown into the cartoon. With it being a movie made based on several games, it would help if you were a gamer though that is really really not essential to understanding the movie. This is because it helps if you recognise the side characters portrayed and may help add to the humor, but I repeat, this is not essential and will no way affect how one enjoys the movie!<br/><br/>So grab a popcorn and a drink and sit back to enjoy the movie with your family or friends!"

","Wreck-It Ralph was released in 2012 and is a happy little story about video game characters. Everyone I knew who had seen it said that they absolutely loved this movie, and were thoroughly entertained. Hearing so much great stuff about it I was of course very excited to see it, yet on watching it yesterday I found that it did not meet my expectations.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly voiced the lead of this film, playing the title character. He did a fine job, but as far as animated films go the actors do not have too much of a task. It is true that voice work can be difficult, but it rarely elevates or brings down the movie when it is done well or poorly. Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, Alan Tudyk, and Sarah Silverman voiced the other leads of the film, the only notable one being Silverman who did the cute but often irritating voice of Vanellope Von Schweetz. <br/><br/>Rich Moore directed and co-wrote this film along with Phil Johnston, Jim Reardon, and Jennifer Lee. The storyline of Wreck-it Ralph was excellent and the dialogue was hilarious and entertaining, yet it wasn't great. Perhaps it was the directing were Wreck-It Ralph seemed to fail for me, but I am unable to pinpoint where exactly the directing went wrong, if it did. There was also a perfectly fine score provided by Henry Jackman, which fit the whole movie, and made a great backup. I think the greatest fault of this film is that it didn't feel like the director, writers, and composer loved the movie they were making, and didn't put their all into it, and simply made a pretty good movie. The result was an entertaining film that will probably be forgotten rather quickly.<br/><br/>I didn't like Wreck-It Ralph, but I didn't hate it either. I'm not sure why this was the case, it seemed like the perfect formula for a good movie, a great idea with good writing and animation, but it didn't seem to hit me as a movie I particularly enjoyed. Wreck-It Ralph was nominated for Best Animated Film in 2013, but lost out to Disney/Pixar's Brave.<br/><br/>I give Wreck-It Ralph a forgettable 6.9/10"
"marc5477","9","0","0","20 May 2013"," I actually stayed awake... and it wasn't bad.
","This movie was a pleasant surprise. I went in expecting to fall asleep as my fianc√© (A big Disney fan) enjoyed her movie, but it really was better than expected. I think the reason I liked it was because it did not take itself very seriously like other pretentious movies nor was the plot inappropriate for the target audience (like falling in love). It was a simple story about immature characters learning a little more about what life is really like and how unfair it can be then growing up a little by the end. I think this would be a great movie for young kids and for us... older kids, we can always enjoy remembering our childhood and how we learned those very same lessons in a less stressful and more forgiving way (movie rather than real life). There was no over the top bloody killing scenes or silly overdrawn dramatic dialog nor artsy fartsy elements, just a story about a guy who was bored and wanted to make friends only to find that that the best friend was the one who understood him best, not the ones he tried to impress. It also teaches that you don't have to be famous and win medals to be important and that hard work and cooperation is required to make the world go round. All good lessons for kids. Maybe I am a sap but since stories cant surprise me anymore, I would rather there be a good lesson rather than nothing at all like most movies today."
"TxMike","Null","0","0","14 May 2013"," Good, funny story, a very entertaining animated feature.
","I am always leery when any movie gets lots of praise, and this one has had its share. But it deserves all of it. The story is very interesting, reminding me a lot of ""Monsters, Inc"" in that the characters in arcade games had lives of their own when the arcade was closed and they were not being ""played."" And the voice-acting is some of the best I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Plus the animation makes the characters' expressions so interesting. With all the mediocre animated features out now, this one shines as one of the best.<br/><br/>The feature arcade game is ""Wreck-It Ralph"", where Ralph wreaks havoc and Felix the repairman with the magic hammer has to go behind him and repair things. That is the object of the game, players need to manipulate Felix to repair Ralph's messes. But Ralph after 30 years has become tired of being the bad guy, he wants to be a hero, to be liked.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly is the voice of Ralph, doing a good job. But the real star is Sarah Silverman voicing Vanellope, the little girl in a different arcade game that Ralph enters. When you put her voice acting together with inventive animation, she is as much fun to watch as ""Wall-E"". <br/><br/>The visual design is very clever. In the arcade all the various machines (games) are plugged into a common power strip. Since characters in arcade games are just electrical signals, in their miniature world they travel within wires and circuits. So the inside of the power strip is made to look similar to the concourse of a train station, with the several tunnels off to each side leading towards the power cord of a different arcade game. So, even though they are not supposed to leave their own game and enter another, they are able to do so and in fact do enter other games. All very interestingly done.<br/><br/>The overall story and its conclusion is a bit intricate to summarize easily, but is straightforward and easy to follow. Good, entertaining movie."
"damittaja","9","0","0","7 April 2013"," An excellent movie for kids and adults alike
","I didn't read any reviews or watch trailers before I went to see this movie in the theater so I expected it to be a regular kids film with a silly story, action and fart humor. My expectations were utterly smashed right from the beginning as the movie revealed itself to be a bow to both the good old and modern times at the same time. I've grown around video games and arcades and this movie is full of those and characters from popular titles. It's part of the pull - you try and see how many you can spot and recognize. I laughed out loud how humor was made out of these characters that would never get a chance to meet otherwise. The jokes very pretty brilliant and yes, there was a few that I just didn't find funny, but that is humor often is - you bundle up a lot of ideas that you think will make people laugh and some of them will hit while others miss.<br/><br/>The story in the movie was interesting and full of twists. You can call it a bit predictable, but hey, kids are supposed to be able to follow it too. The animation was smooth and pretty. Effects and styles were used appropriately in my opinion. Sound effects were fitting also. Because I went to see this film with a few kids, we had to go see the version that was dubbed in Finnish. The voice acting was fitting in that version, but I always prefer the original one and sadly I can't comment on that here.<br/><br/>All in all, if you or your kids like video games this movie will rock for you. That is not to say that you must be a gaming addict to enjoy this one - it's just a nice bonus."

","Wreck It Ralph was by far one of the most enjoyable movies of the year for me so far. I was tired of seeing the movies ""the hangover"" and every other stupid drunk/party movie of the year, so, I bought Wreck It Ralph. First off, I thought the animations were AWESOME. I love the hidden Easter eggs they have hidden throughout the whole film. The high score in Wreck it Ralph being Walt Disney's birthday, the pictures in Tappers hallway being characters from Street Fighter and the Wreck it Ralph designer himself. Everything was animated like it was a real video game (like the pixilated mickey mouse before the film starts), and the lagging movements of the game characters throughout the film. The Skrillex and Sarah Silverman cameos were right on the spot. I'm a huge fan of Skrillex and thought it was amazing how they made him look. Vanellope Von Schweetz was the cutest, most sassy little girl I had ever seen she was in a Disney movie and I liked it. I LOVED her and her attitude. I've watched this film about 8 times already I think (yes I know that's probably more than I should have), but every time I watch it, I find something different in it every time and I enjoy it every time as well. I would recommend the movie to anyone and everyone. Watch it, and I guarantee it, you'll enjoy every second."
"estreet-eva","7","0","0","1 April 2013"," Like Pixar used to make
","Back in the day Pixar would put together culturally-aware, well-written animated fare for children and the parents who had to take them to the movie theater. While ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is no ""Wall-E"" or ""Monsters, Inc"", it is a smart, fun little romp through the annals of video gaming history. John C. Reilly nails the titular role by essentially playing it as the anti-Robin Williams. His even keeled, thoughtful, world-weary, voice work brings a deserved respite from the rapid-fire, jump-cut work of the animated videogames that serve as the film's locations. Rather than the over-the-top scene chewing, you would get from most other voice actors, Reilly delivers a believable relationship arc with Sarah Silverman's video game racing little girl. This warmth carries the film through some slow spots and obvious points where the writers have to wait for something to happen or where they have to write themselves out of corners (wait, so characters who are a product of programming code can change programming code?). Television actors Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch are cast to type and log decent costarring performances. The animation they inhabit is very inventive and smartly emulates thirty years of computational improvements from Fix-It Felix's Donkey Kong clone to the latest Halo-esque first person shooter. However, even non-gamers will find smart references and good performances worth seeing. In short, definitely one to add to your must-see animation list and hopefully one John Lassiter and the boys at Pixar saw."

"caiged","9","0","0","17 March 2013"," Absolutely brilliant, absolutely must see and must own!
","Every once in a while a movie will come out of the blue and hit you right between the eyes, in a good way. Wreck-It-Ralph (WIR) is just one of those movies. It is perhaps one of the best movies I've seen this year, and can confidently put in in the top 5 that for the entire year, despite it being a 2012 release.<br/><br/>Normally, I like to be as objective as possible, but I must confess a certain degree of bias for WIR for it has good visuals, good characterization, and most of all an excellent story.<br/><br/>I state the visuals as being good because that's the best word I can use. They're not stunning compared to other animated movies both old and new but it has been aptly rendered to fit with the video game like feel of the characters.<br/><br/>The main strength of the movie is the story, a clever weaving of different video game characters and giving them a more fleshed out and ""human"" quality. The behind the scenes story was refreshing and highly entertaining. I enjoyed how the story created a link between an arcade player and the character he/she chose. There was also a nice blend of various genres of game styles, appealing a wider viewing audience. The clever part was that pretty much anyone could associate with the characters, across genders and age groups, as we've pretty much encountered similar games over the year. Some of the characters were instantly identifiable, such as the Street Fighter characters or Qbert, but others were play on characters so you did have to stretch your imagination and association.<br/><br/>The story is very well told and moves at a good pace, never stagnating. It's hard to put my finger on it but WIR had an original vibe to it, even without it being a completely new idea. Think of it as a re-imagining of a fairy tale story, only there isn't a dragon, or a chivalrous knight, or a damsel in distress. Again, it's very cleverly done. The range of emotions that movie displays is also staggering. It has everything for everyone- action, humour, romance, drama.<br/><br/>If there is a slight drawback to the movie it would be in the voice over department. I have nothing against John C. Reilly but I felt that his presence took away from Ralph. Every time Ralph spoke I didn't see or hear Ralph. I saw and heard John C. Reilly when I really wanted to see and hear Ralph. A no name but a good voice actor would have been preferable, at least to me. After all in animation movies the characters are promoted, not the actors voicing them. Did mothers and their daughters flock to the cinemas to see Brave because Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson were doing the voice overs? I didn't think so either.<br/><br/>All in all this is a movie that everyone should see. The endearing quality of the movie will have you smiling, laughing, tense, frowning and maybe even in tears. I have been recommending this movie to everyone I talk to about movies, and if you read this review and watch the movie I hope you do to. This movie deserves a rating closer to 9.5 than that overall 7.9 that is stated."

","I don't play video games. Although I work at a store that specializes in movies first and video games second, I get the strangest looks from people when I tell them that. My first reaction is hand gestures that define how much of the store is made up of Blu-rays and DVDs in relation to video games. I didn't get the job there because of my love for video games. That's why I can't say I was all that excited when I saw the trailers for ""Wreck-It Ralph.""<br/><br/>After 30 years of playing the bad guy in his own video game, Ralph (John C. Reilly) is ready to move on to bigger and better things. All he wants is to be accepted by the other characters of the game and be recognized as a hero instead of a villain for once. In order to prove he can be just as good as he can be bad, Ralph embarks on an adventure to other video game worlds to win an award and the respect of his associates. His journey pits him against the ruler (Alan Tudyk) of a racing game obsessed with keeping a glitching character named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) from participating.<br/><br/>I'm more than positive that ""Wreck-It Ralph"" pleases gamers with its homage to video games past and present. The characters are all charming and filmmakers did a wonderful job capturing the looks of different types of old and new games. The only thing I couldn't quite get over was why Ralph and Felix looked so new, but their companions from the 30- year-old game still stuttered a bit when walking and talking.<br/><br/>One thing that impressed me was how animators found a way to keep the style of the different characters consistent while being from different games and decades. Each game had a unique look but still somehow fit together in the grand scheme of the film. A good example of this was the blending of the vastly different ""Hero's Duty"" and ""Sugar Rush"" worlds.<br/><br/>The voice cast for ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is an interesting mix of actors. Instead of the usual Disney TV stars and A-list celebrities we're used to, filmmakers dug a little deeper here. John C. Reilly (""Step Brothers"") lends his voice to the title character while Jack McBrayer (""30 Rock"") plays his nemesis, Fix-It Felix, Jr. Sarah Silverman (""Crank Yankers"") takes on the role of mischievous racer Vanellope von Schweetz. Jane Lynch (""Glee"") voices Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun from ""Hero's Duty."" It's quite a ""mature"" casting choice for a family film, but it works.<br/><br/>Although being a bit complex for younger viewers, ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" will win children over with its mesmerizing animation and appealing characters. Its family-friendly fun which parents who used to play ""Pac- Man"" and ""Super Mario Bros."" can find something humorous in as well. However, it might not have the same appeal to those who never played video games."

","At first glance this would appear, as some reviews have sighted, the new Toy Story (1995). Maybe it is, but I just didn't feel it. I'm old enough to remember these 8-bit games and even though Fix It Felix, Hero's Duty and Sugar Rush are all fictitious, they're all rooted in the reality of the industry, with their real life counterparts being Donkey Kong, Call Of Duty and Super Mario Cart.<br/><br/>The plot is basically that of any Disney film and this is kind of where it fails a little. This isn't Pixar and I'm spending most of the time wishing that it was. Tangled (2010) had the same problem, with it being good, in fact better on the second viewing but not as good the masters of digi-mation would have made it. But Wreck-It Ralph would seem to cry out for the Pixar treatment. Its similarity in tone to Toy Story, with computer game characters coming to life when the kids leave, rather than toys, as well as the fact that this is the perfect subject for a Computer Generated movie!<br/><br/>The comedy was decent, with more of the successful jokes revolving around candy, Mentos and cola, rather than the arcade worlds themselves, but still, plenty of references for the game heads, which my wife is but I'm not, really. It was fun and the final reel was exiting, with the running time pushing two hours, it wasn't overly long but still felt wanting.<br/><br/>I think that it would have been better if there was more that just one line cameos from the established arcade characters, but I'll say it again, that for me, this wanted to be a Pixar classic but just couldn't match the standards."

It's nostalgic top see the old plated characters, or as the film says, retro characters. the story is great, it contrasts squeaky clean games and violent games, and exclaims what the world has come to (in Disney's point of view anyway).

","If you imagined this film to be like'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' except with video game characters,chances are you're going to be a bit disappointed.If,however,you're looking for an entertaining, family friendly film for over the half term that appeals to everyone,then 'Wreck - It Ralph' might be up your street. It works when it wants to and it does have its funny moments. Although considering other Disney films,it doesn't have as many laughs but I think that works because then it makes the comedic scenes all the more funny,especially the sergeant's back story and the laffy taffy which are some of the highlights of the film. <br/><br/>As far as the characters go,I think they're decent enough. Sergeant Calhoun is a pretty good character with a hilariously tragic back story installed, Vanellope is just annoyingly cute, Fix it Felix Jr is a likable character as is Ralph. But the character that stood out has to be King Candy. My favourite aspect about him is the design,I just love how much the design and his personality is based off the mad hatter and it shows throughout. <br/><br/>Now for the things I didn't like. The pace of the film is a bit distracting as about forty five minutes in, Vanellope is already being introduced and from then on,you're pretty much stuck in Sugar Rush. There are a few cut away scenes but they don't last for more the five minutes. Another thing that I didn't particularly like was the training sequence. The scene itself was good but I felt the song they chose to go with it felt out of place and it didn't go with it. But my biggest gripe about this film is the 'I'm bad and that's good. I will never be good,and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me.' thing. It is a good message and all,but I find it a bit mushy for my tastes.<br/><br/>Overall,a pretty good film and is definitely worth checking out at least once."

","With 'retro' very much in fashion these days, and the children of the late 1980's and 1990's now reaching an age where one can get nostalgic about one's childhood, it is the perfect time for there to be a film that harks back to early games consoles. After all, consoles such as the NES, Sega Mega Drive and the SNES, although now very amateur when compared to recent incarnations, were the godfathers of mass mainstream gaming, and a key form of entertainment growing up for the likes of me (I was born in 1984). Wreck-It Ralph, Disney's latest colourful crowd- pleaser, portrays both the demise of blocky finger-bashers, as well as celebrating their retro appeal. It's hook is that its main character, Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), is a bad guy. He spends his days destroying an apartment block with his over-sized hands, while the hero of the game, Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer), uses his magic hammer to fix Ralph's destruction, and therefore winning the game.<br/><br/>Fix-It Felix, Jr. is an old-school arcade game in a similar vein to Donkey Kong, a simple premise, existing solely for it's retro charm amongst modern shoot 'em-ups and dance-mat games. Treated badly by the game's inhabitants due to being the thug of the game, Ralph decides to leave to win a golden coin, cementing himself as a hero. He sneaks into a Halo-like alien shooter called Hero's Duty in which a tough female commander Calhoun (Jane Lynch) narrates to the player, but gets himself into trouble by accidentally taking an alien into another game during his escape with a golden coin. He lands in Candy Land, a colourful racing game with a similar sickeningly sweet feel to Mario Party, where glitch outcast Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) steals his coin and uses it to buy an entry into the main race. Seeing potential disaster for his game, the ruling King Candy (Alan Tudyk), tries to put an end to Vanellope's entry, but Ralph wants his coin back, and the only way to do that is to help her win.<br/><br/>Like the majority of Pixar's, sorry, Disney's output (John Lasseter acts as executive producer), Wreck-It Ralph has the ability to appeal to adults, as well as giving the squirts enough colourful imagery to keep their minds busy between whatever they get up to these days. Although it derives much of its humour from a reliance on the audiences' knowledge of retro computer games, the film has enough playful adult humour to appeal to a wider audience, and is most importantly sweet enough to engage the audiences emotions. Yet for people like me, who grew up on the likes of Super Mario World, Street Fighter II and Duck Hunt, Wreck- It Ralph proves to be an oddly touching lament of a time when games generally had a very basic premise, but were executed with such a charm and addictive quality, that they were entirely endearing.<br/><br/>An early scene that borders on genius sees Ralph in an AA-style meeting for computer game bad guys, with Bowser, Zangief and Clyde from Pac-Man offering support for our titular hero. Upon revealing himself as longing to play the hero, the group erupts, with Clyde going into panic mode the same way he did in Pac-Man. It's a celebration of computer game ticks, with the apartment-folk from Ralph's game moving in a sudden, glitchy fashion, and Felix making a boing sound when he jumps. In fact, it's this ingenuity that leads to the tragic story of Vanellope, who is a glitch in the system, who's potential participation in Candy Land could lead to the player's giving up on the game, causing it to go out-of- order and entering arcade obscurity. Facing this catastrophe, the games inhabitants can at least escape with their lives before the power switch is flipped, but Vanellope cannot exist outside the game, and will die with it.<br/><br/>It's this gentle sentimentality that makes Wreck-It Ralph so enjoyable. Pursuing Ralph is Calhoun and Felix, two contrasting game characters from two entirely different generations (Felix is smitten with her hi- def look), and start a bizarre love story that is as ridiculous as it is oddly touching. Thankfully, it is these types of moments and characters that you take away from the film, and not the overly familiar themes and narrative. Although the setting is unfamiliar and exciting, the plot shares a lot with the likes of Monsters, Inc. (2001) and Toy Story 3 (2010), and climaxes with a staple car-chase, something that seems to plague kiddie-film these days. But Wreck-It Ralph is undeniably irresistible and really quite clever, and although I would have liked to see more game-hopping ingenuity, there is enough here to sustain until the inevitable sequel comes along."

","I didn't really know what to expect when going to see Wreck-It Ralph this week.<br/><br/>The trailer looked promising, but I decided to reserve judgement based on the decline of animated Disney movies over the last number of years, such as the largely unremarkable Cars, Bolt and Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>What played out before my eyes, however, was a visual feast that succeeded in achieving what so many classic Disney movies had before it ‚Äì creating a totally captivating and immersive world for people of all ages to enjoy.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is set in a gaming arcade and begins with a voice-over by none other than Ralph himself, palpably performed by the gummy vocal chords of actor John C. Reilly.<br/><br/>Ralph explains that he has been carrying out the same job for thirty years ‚Äì a job that has seen him play a video game villain throughout this time.<br/><br/>We discover that Ralph has been largely neglected by other characters in the gaming world and as a result no longer wants to be a bad guy; he wants to feel appreciated and accepted for who he is.<br/><br/>Attending a support group for video game antagonists, Ralph confesses his desire to be the good guy for a change, and deciding to prove himself as a 'hero,' Ralph leaves the world in which his own game is based and travels into other games within the arcade, aiming to win a medal he can bring back to prove his worth.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph features a number of stand-out characters, all of which help keep the plot gunning forward at a sharp pace.<br/><br/>A striking feature about most of the characters in the film is that they closely resemble the actors voicing them, including Ralph himself and characters Fix-It Felix and Calhoun, played by Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch respectively.<br/><br/>The main supporting character Vanellope, voiced by Sarah Silverman, however, left me a little disappointed as I felt her character wasn't strong enough for the amount of screen time she had.<br/><br/>Lovers of retro arcade games will no doubt enjoy many of the subtleties and attention to detail that has gone into planning the arcade universe.<br/><br/>It is this attention to detail which makes Ralph's journey all the more enjoyable, coupling a heartfelt and entertaining storyline with an array of breathtaking and colourful visuals.<br/><br/>Free-flowing camera sweeps and a series of well-designed shots further exemplify the environment created in this film, leading us to really come away feeling like we have visited the fictional world in which Ralph lives.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph epitomises the very essence of family entertainment and overall I loved this movie and would regard it as among the best animated films I've seen in recent years."

","Wreck It Ralph, an animation film which entertains more adults then children. I went to see this film in cinema and the room was filled up with different generations and not one person kept a straight face and did not laugh. Video games comes to live.What more could you ask for.<br/><br/>It keeps you laughing constantly. With the voice of Ralph from the fantastic John C. Reilly from the classic Step Brothers, you are sure you love it if you love him. The one thing which was quite bad was the film is in 3D but there wasn't much 3D stuff. They could of made more things pop out, if you get the jist. Disney animations<br/><br/>have certainly made a good film which suits every person.

"michaelthepichael","9","0","0","10 February 2013"," Wreck-It Ralph - An instant Disney Classic
","Ever since that little alien said ""I'm Lost,"" danced with a Hawaiian girl to an Elvis song, and ended up learning the meaning of Ohana, I'd prayed for another motion picture of pure Disney animated magic to match the instant classic that was Lilo and Stitch. That was October 2002.<br/><br/>It's taken ten years for that movie to arrive. It was worth the wait. Wreck-It Ralph is one of Disney's finest creations. Every last one of you has to see this because it's, to quote the critics, ""As phenomenal as Toy Story... Unmissable."" I had high expectations for this, and normally a film disappoints when I do, but this blew them out of the water.<br/><br/>I would not dream of spoiling a single moment in the film, because it, more so then any film of recent memory, creates a world of it's own and the rules governing them. Every action every character makes is true to their personalities. In visuals, sound, music (all perfectly balancing the right mix of retro nods and genuine storytelling) it is a triumph, as well as the voice actors' work, who are well-known but not huge celebrities, and never make you think of the actor instead of the character (except for cameo character Sonic, but his voice in the last decade had become infamous for annoying die-hard Sonic fans).<br/><br/>Another great triumph is how it mixes the video game nods with it's story, which actually delves into what these character's lives are like when the arcade is closed. The references, both to video games and other films, as as well-structured as those in Bug's Life, Toy Story and all the Pixar classics. No doubt the work of Executive Producer John Lasseter, and Director Rich Moore, a Simpsons and Futurama veteran with several Emmys under his belt.<br/><br/>Animation-wise? It's a triumph. Though it follows the more modern CGI rule of animators working on scenes as opposed to specific characters like all the 90's Disney films, the gestures, facial expressions and movements of the characters fit perfectly and make them as believable as fish, monsters, or even robots. Not just the five key players, but others too, showing that the crew love the source material. The design glows, both from the 8-bit graphics we see from outside the game to the fleshed- out interiors. Fix-It Felix Jr. purposefully looks like a not very visually detailed game on the inside. Hero's Duty is a mix of every Sci-Fi FPS out there from Halo to Gears of War. Game Central Station is a vast hub room, and it makes sense.<br/><br/>But Sugar Rush, where we spend most of our time, is gorgeous (even if the film only had visuals going for it, there would be plenty of eye candy to behold). It meshes the speed of Mario Kart (the game's fictional release date is, not coincidentally, 1997) with the cuteness of Kirby, feeling like it was from Japan (no coincidence that the film's Japanese title is Shug√¢ Rasshu, securing at least moderate success for it over there).<br/><br/>You can't talk about a Disney movie without mentioning the soundtrack, can you? Not including two existing songs (Shut Up And Drive serves some narrative usage) there are four new songs, one a gritty remix for Hero's Duty, and the other three being credits songs. 'When Can I See You Again?' is to this what 'Down To Earth' was for WALL-E, continuing the story during 3 minutes of a stylistic epilogue. 'Wreck It, Wreck-It Ralph', written by the same people who did the Pac-Man Theme Song, is a single that reveals some fictional back-story for Ralph and Felix. And 'Sugar Rush' makes some inspired decisions, especially being sung by Japanese artists and having some Japanese vocals in it. They are along the line of Tarzan's songs - tasty, catchy junk food. I predict them becoming a guilty pleasure for many.<br/><br/>Outside of The Lion King and possibly Dinosaur, Disney scores rarely stick around too long in the viewer's head. Composer Henry Jackman blends video game stylization with standard modern orchestration, and the style dominates, both to it's credit and against it. It certainly helps the movie feel more authentic, though the themes won't stick with many. Then again, hands up anyone who remembers specific cues from the Toy Story films? Regardless, it cannot be faulted, and does it's job effectively, ranging from Carl Sterling territory to full orchestral sections in the more tender moments. The Act III cues, in particular, do everything right (The denouement cue is beautiful, and I love it after one listen).<br/><br/>I have several dozen other, well-structured reasons why this film is a masterpiece, but I want everyone to discover all the surprises in it. Decades from now, students will be studying this film's structure alongside Star Wars, Wizard of Oz and Jaws. OK, maybe I'm being too optimistic there, but this is the same guy who has A Bug's Life as his favorite Pixar film, so what do I know? Obvious joke there aside, video game fans will naturally have a field day in the cinema (or on DVD/Blu-Ray - I'm sure, unlike many recent animated films, it won't lose it's impact outside of the cinema).<br/><br/>Recommend this to everyone. Don't forget to take the kids - they'll enjoy it almost as much as you will. Even cynical teenagers should love this (I'm still the latter, but not the former). Wreck-It Ralph is an instant classic, and I'm intent on paying it another viewing or two, in the cinema. See it, enjoy the cleverness of it, feel for the 3D characters (structure-wise - I saw this in 2D) and love it. Never take the film for granted, because it's to movies what Super Mario Galaxy was to video games.<br/><br/>""As great as Toy Story 1, 2, and 3."" ""Destined to be a classic."""

","After a stomping success in the States, this witty retro gaming homage is the first bow in the Disney Animation Studios' arrow to be as ardent and artistically ballsy as the work from those neighboring Pixar bigwigs.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly heads a staggeringly good voice cast as the eponymous Ralph, an oafish behemoth who has spent the last thirty years as a bad guy in an old fashioned arcade video game. His daily routine sees him having to smash up an apartment building, only to find goody-goody superbuilder Fix-It Felix (voiced by 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer) come whizzing in to repair the damage. An outcast amongst the rest of the game's characters, Ralph sits in on existential Bad Guy group counselling classes. While he may have friends in fellow heels Dr. Robotnik and Bowser, Ralph wishes that he could give up on the villain's life entirely and switch over to the light side. On a pursuit to prove his valor, he wanders across various gaming platforms on the hunt for a honorary golden medallion, which sees him taking orders from bossy Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) in a Halo style shoot-em-up; to meeting kindred spirit Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a lost little girl stuck inside a sickly sweet K- pop parody racing game called Sugar Rush.<br/><br/>If, like me, you spent many rainy day hours festering in front of a gaming console, you will simply adore this film. The first twenty minutes are brimming with nudging sight gags that pay homage to old greats like Space Invaders and Sonic. Directed and co-written by Rich Moore (The Simpsons, Futurama), Wreck-It Ralph successfully adopts the Toy Story model by being genuinely universal; entertaining both for the nostalgic Generation X adult audiences and their iPad wielding children. It's artistically ambitious too, embracing the old fashioned, staccato movements of 8-bit arcade games in one scene, and then moving to contemporary, HD fluidity in the next. Equal parts traditional and transgressive, it means that the impressive 3-D rendering benefits the story, rather than impinges it.<br/><br/>Another huge achievement is in the pitch-perfect casting. Reilly is sublime as the downbeat hero at the heart of the film, perfectly complemented by Silverman's shrill as precocious girl- racer Vanellope. Fans of the recently terminated NBC series 30 Rock will cherish hearing McBrayer going full-on Kenneth mode as the ebullient, Super Mario styled Felix, and Lynch, well, Lynch is always fantastic, isn't she?<br/><br/>It won't turn you into a blubbering mess like the regular gushing Pixar fare, and the story of heroism and friendship is hardly revolutionary, but Wreck-It Ralph is a defiant and highly entertaining passion project. Similarly to Sony's fantastic Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs, Disney have created a CGI animation feature which will eventually become known as a retro cult-classic.<br/><br/>More reviews, interviews and other film stuff over at www.theframeloop.com"
"madkaugh","7","0","0","4 December 2012"," Great Disney kids animation. Adult mileage may vary.
","It may not be quite fair to say that Disney kids animation has essentially one plot line, and multiple settings; for one thing, the lead is a male here. Still, the ubiquitous Disney themes and tropes are there, and if someone says Disney princesses, you know exactly what they mean.<br/><br/>I went in with a party of four adults and two very young children. The kids loved it. The adults thought it was humorous at times, and we caught the video game references. Meh, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World did the retro-video game humor better.<br/><br/>This is essentially Shrek, substitute 'video arcade universe' for 'fairy tale fantasy universe' and remove the anti-Disney snark. Production values were Pixar quality; visually, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Take your younger kids, then impress them with your arcane knowledge of video characters from the primordial days of 8 and 16 bits. Watch the group therapy humor, targeted at you, not them. Enjoy the excellent silent arty short, The Paperman, that plays before the main movie. If you stay for the credits, watch for ""The Caffineator"".<br/><br/>I'd rate this 10 out of 10 for very young kids, maybe 8 out of 10 if you are a video gamer that remembers the older games, and no more than a 6 out of 10 if you are not a gamer. If 'Disney cute' isn't your cup of tea, this will definitely not be."

","'WRECK-IT RALPH': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Disney attempts to do a Pixar quality animated picture without Pixar and they don't do a bad job at it! The film tells the tale of an arcade world where the arcade characters are alive and one video game bad guy is tired of being a villain and sets out to be a hero for once (abandoning his game, which causes trouble for the rest of the game world). John C. Reilly stars as the voice of the titular character and Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch and Alan Tudyk co-star. Rich Moore (a veteran director of cartoon shows like 'FUTURAMA', 'THE SIMPSONS' and 'THE CRITIC') made his feature film debut directing the movie. He also co-wrote it along with Phil Johnston, Jennifer Lee and Jim Reardon. John Lasseter (a veteran Pixar director and producer) executive produced the film. The movie doesn't match the very best of Pixar but it does rival it's less than stellar offerings (There's also a Disney short film before the movie, 'PAPERMAN', that rivals the best of Pixar's shorts).<br/><br/>The film is set at Litwak's Arcade where video game characters roam from game to game at night when the arcade is closed. Wreck-It Ralph (Reilly) is tired of being the villain of the game 'Fix-It Felix, Jr.' where the other video game characters have treated him like an outcast all of the game's thirty years of existence. Ralph decides one night, while at a video game villain support group, he no longer wants to be a villain. After learning that characters in the new first-person shooter game 'Hero's Duty' can win a medal for heroics in their game he abandons his game and sets out to win a medal there. This causes havoc not only for his game but the entire arcade as he accidentally unleashes a Cy-Bug, with powers to multiply and destroy everything in it's path (and when a video game character dies outside his own game he dies for good). Ralph meets an outcast, named Vanellope (Silverman), in a kart-racing game and the two team up in order to help each other find happiness and better fit in in to their own video game worlds.<br/><br/>The movie is a little like a cross between 'TOY STORY' and 'TRON'; it resembles 'TRON' because of it's story involving characters that live inside a video game and 'TOY STORY' because these characters do what kid's want of them during the day but have their own lives at night, when they're not being watched. Several characters from actual video games have cameos in the film and the movie is a good tribute to video games and arcades. It's funny at times and also has a lot of melodrama (like most Disney, as well as all, animated kids films). It's got a lot of cheesy humor and drama but at times it's genuinely funny as well as touching (like most Pixar films). The message about acceptance of outcasts is also very powerful and positive for kids. It's not quite as clever as the director's TV work or as classic as 'TRON' or 'TOY STORY' but it is as good as your average Pixar film, which is what I think Disney set out to do.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ"

Great concept but fell short. Even with all the kids in the audience, there wasn't a lot of laughing going on. The movie tried too hard to be funny. Most of the attempted try at humor was in the trailer. I would recommend taking your child but definitely not an adult themed movie. A very big disappointment."

After wanting to see this movie since its release, I am sorry to say what an utter disappointment it is.<br/><br/>While it is no doubt packed with imagination, Disney hitting every single note square on the head as they do - complete with annoying character mannerisms, perfectly timed plot point points and predictable twists - takes the heart completely out of this movie.<br/><br/>All you need to do is listen to the song that plays over the ending credits. It is an over-produced pop song that caters to the lowest common denominator - a perfect match for the movie that is supposed to be Wreck-It Ralph. Unfortunately, if you possess an inkling of film appreciation, your hopes of a thrilling throwback to the days of Donkey Kong arcade games will be left sorely unfulfilled.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a great animation, avoid Wreck-It Ralph at all costs. Instead, go watch Ratatouille. Don't believe me? Even Victor Haboush (veteran Disney animator who worked on Sleeping Beauty and more) calls it the best animation since Pinnochio. Oh, and A Bug's Life."

It's message seemed to be that kids aren't meant to aspire to improve or change their lives to be happy. Another problem I had with the film was that the relationship between Wreck It Ralph and Fix It Felix was barely explored other than a description of who the characters were. The third problem was that Vanellope von Schweetz took up too much of the plot and the only scene I liked her in was the one on the tree. The last major problem I had was that too much attention was given to the emotions of Vennelope Von Schweetz and not enough was given to either Wreck It Ralph or Fix It Felix. The film did have some funny moments and I also liked the therapy scene that Wreck It Ralph attends, the reason I liked this scene was because it had several entertaining or funny characters such Wreck It Ralph, Zangieb, The Zombie and the little blue Pac Man. I enjoyed the use of the Flo Rida song in the previews but was disappointed to not hear it when I saw the actual film.

I remember liking this quite a bit when I saw it in theaters, but maybe I was just on a high after seeing Paperman play right before it. It's frustratingly mediocre, and the fact that it doesn't seem to have any ambitions beyond that makes it even more disappointing this time around.<br/><br/>Ralph is a pretty lovable character by the end of the movie, though I had a really hard time feeling sorry for his plight at first because he seemed to cause all the problems for himself, but once he meets up with Vanellope and helps her along he becomes a big-hearted guy worth cheering for. I wish he had a better movie around him. I think the moral of being comfortable with yourself is a little hazily told, but it seems like a good lesson for kids.<br/><br/>I will say that despite my distaste for much of it I was never not engaged. The world is a lot of fun and the voice actors do well. I completely love the idea of the central station, that's so clever. So is the bad-guy group session.

"nickmesafilms","10","2","5","13 November 2012"," Wreck-It Ralph (2012) - You're a Bad Guy...But That Does Not Mean You're a Bad Guy!
","""Wreck-It Ralph"" is the newest addition in a series of classic films brought to life from the one and only Disney Animation Studios. It's the film that will steal the hearts of millions and millions of video game fan-boys, but also some film lovers, as well. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" tells a newly original story about a video game character named Wreck-It Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, who's the bad guy in an arcade game named ""Fix-It-Felix Jr."", a game that has been around for 50 years. Ralph is the bad guy that wrecks the building, while Fix-It-Felix, voiced by Jack McBrayer, is there to fix the building with his trusty hammer. But, when the lights go off at the arcade, the video game characters come to life, when nobody is looking. Yeah, it's very similar to the premise of ""Toy Story"", but this is a different movie with it's own way of telling the story. Anyways, while Fix-It-Felix is the character of the game given the most recognition, it's Ralph that is given tons of loathe, since his reputation is just being the bad guy who just wrecks the building. But Ralph doesn't want to be the bad guy anymore, and he wants a chance to actually become the good guy for once, and actually get the recognition he has always wanted. So, Ralph decides to go ""turbo"", jumping from one game to the next, trying to win a medal for a game that will turn him into a good guy. I should stop discussing about the plot at this exact moment, because it's completely better to walk into this film with a clear state of mind, and I bet you, you'll walk out incredibly surprised. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is one of the best and one of the most entertaining films of the whole year. It's that rare family film that never loses it's heat. Reminding me a lot of another great film, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"", this movie does a great job of delivering a lot of great pop-culture video game references, while not going too far by throwing them at your face. If you're a die-hard video game lover, there's going to be a lot of familiar video game characters that they'll easily be able to spot throughout the entire 92-minute run time. I also loved how this movie ""pokes fun"" at the video game world, where video game characters can travel from one game to the next, and how some characters can come to life after the arcade closes. It's one of those rare concepts that will definitely keep audiences entertained for the majority of it all. Now, that we got all of that ""fanboy"" talk out of the way, let's focus on the rest of the movie! The animation is made perfectly, and it's so great to look at, it actually felt like a Pixar-film at times. John C. Reilly and Jack McBrayer both deliver some of the most memorable voice performances of the year, especially John C. Reilly, who delivers such a realistic performance that feels more like a human being, than just a video game character. But there are plenty of members in the voice cast that have their ability to shine. From Sarah Silverman's role as a little girl that Ralph meets in a game called ""Sugar Rush"" (a cross-over between Mario Kart and Candy Land), Jane Lynch as the bad-ass leader of a group of soldiers in a game called ""Hero's Duty"" (think of ""Call of Duty""), to Alan Tudyk as King Kandy from the Sugar Rush game, who seems to be a duplication of the Mad Hatter from ""Alice in Wonderland"" (the original one, not the one with Johnny Depp). As the film continues to entertain all audiences alike, it's until the third act when the movie starts to do something unexpectedly. It reaches to an emotional level, leading to a heartwarming final act. From the first shot to the closing credits, this is a feel-good and entertaining motion picture that knows it's audience, and keeps the entertainment factor cranked all the way up to 11, even with the usual and traditional storyline of believing in yourself, and always stay true to who you are, even if others view you differently. From a cool soundtrack, clever use of video game references, beautiful animation, incredible voice acting, and a great heart, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is the best animated film of the entire year. ""Wreck-It Ralph"", in my review, ""satisfyingly entertaining, a truly enjoyable delight""."

","The most falsely promoted kid's film since BRAVE, this has little to do with the title character, a video game villain who, like Donkey Kong, wreaks havoc atop a building while the good guy named Fix-it Felix gets all the glory.<br/><br/>Felix lives in a nice house while Ralph resides in the city dump and isn't allowed to party with society folk. An interesting premise is derailed once our misunderstood hero, after sharing his troubles with a group of other antagonists including the Pac Man Ghost, wins a military award and then accidentally winds up in a game called SUGAR RUSH where everything is made of candy.<br/><br/>Ralph meets an annoying little girl named Vanellope who wants to qualify in an important car race. Meanwhile he's lost his medal and can no longer prove that¬Ö well... who really cares about the initial plot (a bad guy wanting to be good) because the movie sure doesn't, getting lost in the vapid saccharine world where an evil king (who at least has a professional sounding voice-over) rules with an iron fist. Not even Felix, joined by Jane Lynch's gung-ho militant babe, can help matters.<br/><br/>Because the main problem with WRECK-IT RALPH is the title... with all the glossy distractions, the big lug hardly matters at all.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","I went to the cinema expecting a classic animated film such as Finding Nemo or Toy Story and was left bitterly disappointed!<br/><br/>The comedy was lost on me in this one. I was left with the dilemma, sit and watch the end of this movie and be bored to death while missing my bus home or make a quick escape. I chose the latter.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm sure this will appeal greatly to young children of no older than 10, but anyone looking for anything more than a few childish jokes will likely be left very disappointed.<br/><br/>I gave this 3/10 which is probably harsh but I've seen a lot of high ratings that don't seem accurate and wanted to even it out."

","This movie is excellent. The direction, animation and hats off to writers. Excellent story that have changed my perspective on animated movies. I am finding myself very much lucky to born in the era of this movie. Completely blown my mind. I have not seen any other movies like this. I am now waiting for part 2 to come. Again do not miss this. It will change your views on animated movies. I believe this is once in a life time movie. Beautiful script won my heart. I am very much disappointing that this movie does not won Oscar. The rating should be more than 9. It is very much disappointing that such movie does not get support from viewers.

","Brave sucks BEAR NOSES! Take home that Oscar, Wreck-It Ralph!<br/><br/>I just re-watched this film with some friends (who had never seen it before) and I was reminded of how much I loved it! My friends found it pleasantly surprising too! They loved how it was a universe of video game characters that came & gathered together,much like ""Toy Story"". Even with many fictional games being created for the film was quite a talented thing to do! I never thought of it that way before! The villain was interesting, the plot was smart, the jokes were just TOO funny, and all the characters were just all-round likable without being too over-the-top. And that Owl City song at the end certainly was the icing on the cake!<br/><br/>How the flying FRIDGE does an unlikable & unoriginal film (Brave) beat a funnier, smarter, enjoyable, touching, & better original film???<br/><br/>""Brave"" was so silly, so rushed, so uncomfortable & cringe-worthy & stressful - I can't even remember anything likable about it. Though to be fair, I will say Merida from Brave might LOOK like a creative & interesting princess, but the story was just a MESS! Plus, it's quite hysterical that if the rules apply, if Merida shot all the arrows and won against the others (even in slo-mo. I know, wut??), wouldn't that mean should would have to marry herself?? lol (Hey, ""The Little Mermaid 2"" explored the daughter-mother concept better than ""Brave"".)<br/><br/>I call it completely COWARD-like of the Academy to perform this action of giving the Oscar to the WRONG movie! Did they even SEE the same movie I did!?? Put ME on the Academy - I'm sure I could do things a whole lot better.<br/><br/>(And no, I'm not one of those who think that ""Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Oscar"" - c'mon, I have a whole page dedicated to talking about male celebrities who're SO MUCH hotter & talented than him. He doesn't deserve to get a majority of the praise for playing the same shouting, foul- mouthed, insecure, degenerate in so many darn movies! And seriously, his talent really is just limited to shouting)<br/><br/>Anyways, I'm SO excited this movie exists, it's a great nostalgia trip to anyone who grew up playing video games, and that 'Wreck-It Ralph 2' is in the works! ""Brave 2"" better not steal the Oscar this time! lol<br/><br/>Glad ""Frozen"" won the Oscar Disney SHOULD have for Wreck-It Ralph.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>PS: Not also do I like this film for introducing me to the talented Sarah Silverman, but the actress herself is Jewish! And I've got quite soft spot for Jewish people - and I never did find her character, Vanellope von Schweetz, at all annoying (like my sisters did). She was just TOO cute, funny, and likable!"
"pavelb-968-44685","4","2","6","19 April 2014"," Imagination overload?
","Disclaimer: The writer is an old guy who never played video games, or frequented Arcades. This is a very imaginative kid's picture that might have benefited from a decrease in visual intensity. The use of pinks and purples everywhere did something negative to my older brain (I found Sesame Street to be too frenetic) and so had to look away numerous times and go to the 'fridge often. The main character is quite good - the ultimate ""blunt instrument""- but the little girl didn't come across as well as any of the little girls in 'Despicable Me'. The strange green-sphere character reminded me of the depressed robot in Douglas Adams'""The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy"", but strangely, wasn't developed at all. In a way, this is a blended LSD-enhanced sequel of ""Toy Story"" and ""Cars"" with a 'situation' to decide who belongs and who's best. The car race should have been dumped - it's been done to death - and some sort of intelligence or loyalty (veiled morality?) puzzle used to end the show in Ralph's favour. This isn't a bad picture, it just pales in comparison to other animations. I sympathize with the writers and get the strong impression that good novel scripts are elusive."

","I wasn't really looking for much going into this movie. I figured there would be a story, some plot development, and something to neaten things up in the end. I don't think I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Wreck-it Ralph starts as a first person account of a bad guy in a video game, quickly jumps from that to a self-help group, moves into some other video games where non-pressing problems are resolved, and wraps it all up in a ending that may or may not be happy. It was just as flat as it sounds. No CGI eye candy. No human interest development. No real attempt. I get the sense that the video game theme was meant to carry the picture, but it didn't.<br/><br/>This film compares well with sequels that were never supposed to be shown in the theatre. If you spent time in an arcade or played any video games the characters do what you would expect. Beyond tugging at memories of past gaming experiences Wreck-it Ralph is just a disconnected collage of those same memories. Watch it and then go play some video games to erase it from your memory."

In another words: a strong second half.<br/><br/>Make no mistake: this is a kids movie. However, there are things an adult can enjoy. While I found very few laugh-out-loud things, it still kept a smile on my face for a decent part of it.....and the colors were astounding. Please see this on Blu-Ray, if you have the opportunity. I don't have a 3-D player so I can't comment on that aspect. Bet it looks cool.<br/><br/>Overall, a fun film that I'd watch more than once."

","This film is possibly the BEST viseo game vased film I have seen. It excceded my expectations and was really suprises that it was made by Disney, as it feels more like a Pixar or Dreamworks film. This film truly works well as a 3D animation. I love the visuals in this. The story is also very good as well. I absolutely love Ralph and Penelope and all the other side characters. The villian is ok, but I do like his back story more. It is an amazing Disney flick that I 100% recommned. Disney Animation were on fire during this time.

"adampkalb","10","1","2","31 July 2018"," Are you a fan of video games? Then you'll love this movie.
","Wreck-It-Ralph was a cool film. The video games made up for this film, Fix-It-Felix and Sugar Rush, are both inspired by real video games that are Mario-related, which are Donkey Kong and Mario Kart. The Sugar Rush also reminds me a lot of the Sweet Sweet Canyon from Mario Kart Wii. There's also another game called Hero's Duty that's obviously Call of Duty renamed. Much like legos in The Lego Movie and toys in Toy Story, Wreck-It-Ralph also bought the rights to show or cameo other pre-existing video game characters, like Qbert and Sonic. They even remembered Tapper! That's a very obscure game from 1983.<br/><br/>From what I hear, they actually could afford the rights to show Mario (Charles Martinet) in Wreck-It-Ralph, but had no place in the story for him. They barely even had a spot for Sonic (Roger Craig Smith) in the PSA about dying out of your own game. I really loved this film, but I still wonder how come everybody from all the old 8-bit games (including Ralph and Felix) still has their own modern CGI design on the other side of the screen. I thought Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch played off each other very well, and this film also made me a fan of John C. Reilly. Vanellope was annoying at first, but then I started to like her more later in the film. She's very cute and she also sounds exactly like Sarah Silverman's Ollie Pesto from Bob's Burgers.<br/><br/>I just want to say that I love Wreck-It-Ralph so much and I can't wait for the sequel Ralph Breaks the Internet to come out. All of the princesses from earlier animated Disney films will be in this movie, but I am most excited to see Mario! Maybe he will have an important part in the story helping Ralph and Vanellope. Bonus points if Luigi gets to be included in this. Hopefully Ralph Breaks the Internet will have better execution of The Emoji Movie's plot of traveling through various products, and get to be an admirable video since The Emoji Movie was the 146th atrocity video. I just hope Wreck-It-Ralph 2 doesn't fail like Mulan 2 from destroying the first movie's principles, where Felix feared Ralph was ""going Turbo"" by leaving their video game for Hero's Duty in the first film and Wi-Fi in the second film."

"zkonedog","7","1","2","5 March 2017"," Tapping Into Arcade Nostalgia
","Before the invention of home video consoles or the smartphone games that are now so ubiquitous, there was the ""arcade generation"", who controlled their pixels at the arcade via quarters. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" taps into that ""arcade nostalgia"" by focusing on the ""downtime"" exploits of the arcade's heroes and villains.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" follows a premise very similar to ""Toy Story"" in that when the arcade closes for the night, the characters behind the glass come to life. In one particular game entitled ""Fix-It Felix Jr."", the ""bad guy"" character named Wreck-It Ralph (voice of John C. Reily) is having a rough time due to the fact that he is an outcast in his own game. One day, Ralph decides to game-jump (a move that can have devastating consequences on all parties involved) in a quest to prove that he isn't all bad. Along the way, he meets up with a ""glitch"" named Vanellope (Sarah Silverman), who helps him to understand what being a ""good guy"" is truly all about.<br/><br/>Story-wise, this is pretty stock Disney fare. It is a feel-good message that, at times, can get a little predictable. The voice-overs match the characters, the plot moves along nicely, and overall it is just a well-paced film. It is full of enough sight gags and crazy antics to hook the kiddies in right away and keep their interest throughout.<br/><br/>Of course, the new era of Disney animation needs more than that, so the ""hook"" of this film is the nostalgia that adults will feel towards the arcade atmosphere. The film has cameos from many past games (Bowser, Q*bert, & the Street Fighter cast being the most obvious), as well as pays homage to the ""beeps and boops"" and sometimes jerky motions of those old classics. For true fans of the history of gaming, there are enough ""easter eggs"" hidden in the background, so to speak, to pique your interest and/or make you chuckle.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a fine film filled with humor, heart, and (most importantly) video game nostalgia. It isn't quite as perfectly polished as some other Disney fare (thus the one-star deduction), but it still was fun to watch for both old and young."
"christinemsky","7","1","2","28 February 2017"," Wreck-It Ralph
","The hero in this animation is Ralph. He was a villain in a pixel game. Disney did expand its imagination that the story was set in the world of characters from recreational machines in a game room. In Ralph's game, he, as the bad figure, he wrecked things and damaged buildings. Every night when the game room was closed, the figures in Ralph's game took rest and had fun while Ralph was isolated, sleeping on the garbage hill. By incident, he ran away and caused trouble of being shut down for his game. During his journey afterwards, he accidentally met a girl from a racing game who was also marginalized. After destroyed the big conspiracy in the game world, Ralph finally accept his identity as a bad guy while the figures in his game accept him as well. Once, the I have learnt from Disney animations was nothing more than platitude, such as loving others, being kind, having an optimistic attitude and so on. This animation particularly changed my bored notion towards Disney even the whole animated motion picture world. From Wreck-It Ralph, I find the exact thing I myself want to achieve ‚Äì be the most authentic self, in the end, there definitely will be the people appreciate you. During the climactic plot when Ralph wanted to sacrifice himself, he whispered to himself: ""I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me"". That is the exact moment that Ralph's acceptance revealed from his lines, and audiences truly reach the gist beyond the traditional spirit of adventure. In the end of the story, Ralph said: ""Turns out I don't need a medal to tell me I'm a good guy. 'Cause if that little kid likes me¬Ö How bad can I be?"" Superficially it seems that Ralph considered him a good guy due to the Little girl's fondness. Actually, Ralph was recalling his memorable adventure with the girl and emphasizing the significance of accepting oneself. Disney shows its transition from animations purely for preschoolers to impressive artworks with polysemy which thus makes those acceptable to people at all ages. By the way, the detail settings were stunning. Apart from the Villain Mutual Aid Society which the first line quoted in last paragraph was from, the environment in the snack world was amazing. The designer applied mints as stalactites and cola as magma. When the mints fell from the dome, there would be a volcanic eruption."
"troublesometasha13","10","1","2","31 October 2016"," Disneys forgotten diamond - absolutely brilliant!
","This is truly one of disneys best works and I've seen pretty much every Disney movie released. Wreck it Ralph is fun, original, cool with a piece of Disney magic as always.<br/><br/>The concept of gamer tokens coming to life, having their own lives and visiting other games when the arcade is closed is simply brilliant!! <br/><br/>The cast is fabulous, not going to lie I was put off I heard who voiced Ralph as he is more of an adults actor but it works really well and the voice of vanelope is perfect... I was shocked to read on here that she was a fully fledged adult! I entirely expected her to be voiced by an actual child. <br/><br/>The way the movie mixes classic retro games with new hi tech games is brilliant and the music that accompanies the various scenes is spot on too. The only one snag with the music is I do love it when the Disney characters belt out a tune themselves - but I'm not totally convinced Ralph would have been suited to singing out loud! Lol<br/><br/>We must have watched this film a hundred or so times by now and it never gets boring! It's a shame it wasn't better advertised when it was released - I don't remember seeing much anyway, because I believe it is one of disneys best films to date."
"battlestar_pilot","10","1","2","5 October 2016"," A wonderful piece of filmmaking both to look at and experience. Love it!
","It's impossible not to feel a strong sense of nostalgic amusement, if not sheer delight, at the comings and goings of all these characters. Too bad there was no Mario appearance. But the story is phenomenal, the voice acting is perfect, the comedy is hilarious, and the animation is breathtaking.<br/><br/>So about the animation¬Ö WOW! There are so many different styles in this film from the 1980s Qbert-tastic era to streamlined present-day gun-slinging war games. Characters like Felix, Jr., and Ralph move smoother because their characters have more to do in the video game, hence, they would have better animation to begin with. You also see the old school video characters who have less detail and range of motion to them, which I think was a gorgeous addition to the believability of the world (the Tapper scene says it all as you watch the blinking eyes while he cleans a glass). Details in the living spaces, food, props of the worlds, etc., were also very well thought out and animated. I loved it when Ralph smashed the cake and the frosting splattered on everyone. Well, of course, the splatter pattern is that of a low-pixel 1980's game! It splattered in blocky groupings! Noticing that made me laugh out loud.<br/><br/>This film made use of multiple different settings. There is the ""Fix It Felix, Jr.,"" early 80's pixelation, freshly plugged-in military ""Hero's Duty,"" sugary sweet ""Sugar Rush"" racing, the Game Central Station, and other locales in between that the characters visit after the arcade's closing time. To create just one believable game world is mind blowing enough. But the distinction between all these different worlds and the work it must have taken to put this film together is unbelievable! Colors, textures, lighting, etc., were all plotted out uniquely for each place the characters visited. Even the sounds, like the ping of Felix's hop, help to detail the worlds to a T.<br/><br/>This film is great on so many levels. I enjoyed every minute of the film. Its got the fast-paced race scenes with Sugar Rush, a bit of an espionage feel as Ralph and Vanellope (who has pixlexia by the way) secretly make a racing vehicle and retreat to a secret hide- out, its got surprises, plot twists, and great albeit unconventional characters. There are so many gorgeous-looking moments in this film proving that every detail was painstakingly thought out by the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Some other fantastic bits: 1) The reveal of Calhoun's backstory and how she pulls out this massive gun from her wedding dress! 2) Fix-It Felix, Jr. He's such a hilarious goodie two shoes down to the sweet Southern accent and innocent metaphors. ""She gives me the honey glow¬Ö"" 3) The voices never get in the way of the characters. In some movies, you can clearly picture the actor over the character. I had this problem with Meg Ryan voicing Anastasia. This movie, everything is perfectly played. There is a fine line with Calhoun, but the other characters help to balance out Lynch's otherwise ""Glee""- attitude ways.<br/><br/>It's a pretty wonderful piece of filmmaking to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, and the characters are all lively and written with a skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a ""simple"" kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw let audiences know just how ""pretty"" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals."
"hikerhetav","7","1","2","5 August 2016"," Are you bad enough to be called a bad guy? You just need a pal to call you nice
","Well, I'm not into animated films that much even though I've seen quite a few films in the genre. I've liked one or two of them and again got bored by two another. Wreck it Ralph comes in first category, thankfully it didn't bore me that much in the end. See, if I plan to see animated film I always think about its emotional factor. I always see cartoon movies just for relaxing my mind. That doesn't mean I don't see other genre. I see a lot of genre movies and I like all of them if they convince me on understandable grounds.I liked Rango, Lion King and even Brave. But Big Hero 6, just due to its poor second half ruined my time. But in this 'wrecking' movie, it didn't wreck my time, it really wrecked my haunting emotions. So, even though I watch many movies based on their technical grounds, I am not going to crop out what's bad or what's good. It did make my time good and that's what I matter most. <br/><br/>Coming to the movie, Ralph is a guy to watch. He gets a plethora of condemn in his life for whatever he does. Yes, but he is not a 'let it go' person. However he knows he just can't change his work whatever he's doing, he takes a long break and finds another way to have some interesting work where he can get praise as well as self satisfaction. And he is really good at that. But what it is to see here is, there should be none else to call you again that you are bad or incapable of doing any good if you haven't ever done that. In life, we should remember that however how bad enough we are or how bad work we are able to do, but if some pal of us praise us and our work, that's enough for our meaningful life. We don't always live or race in our life for a medal which might symbolize how great we are. Instead we just go on doing our work honestly and without any expectations of achievements, but if we can get praise from any one of our pals our life is successful. I think that's it from the movie. <br/><br/>So if you ever get bored of your usual movies whatever you see, and needed a change to get your nerves relax, this is the one medicine for all that pain or stress in life."

Also, he wants to be a hero like Fix-it Felix Jr, so he can not be convinced by his situation. So, he always has an emotional turmoil. Not only Ralph but also every character have a problem , so we can empathize with everyone, even if he/she is a real villain.<br/><br/>Afetr I watched this film, I felt warring emotions which characters in it have reflects the actual world.

And Jane Lynch is a perfect choice for the call of duty like female gamer role! I really loved how this isn't just one of those pointless kiddie movies about nothing special, but this is actually a very well thought out film worthy of many big time cinematic roles.

","A lovely animated modern animation from Disney and it's thoroughly enjoyable without all the usual fairytale folklore and princesses. Ralph is a computer game bad guy in the ""Fix it, Felix junior"" arcade game. He longs to be celebrated as a hero and just given the decency of been included with the other pixels. One night while out drinking in the in- between world of the arcade games (where all the arcade game characters live when the arcade is closed) Ralph hatches a misjudged plan to get into another game and finally become a celebrated hero, ideally with a medal too so he can 'stick it to' the characters in his own game. Disaster strikes, Ralph crashes from one game to another and inadvertently takes a viral component with him. Unbeknown to Ralph who is trying to solve the oddities if the Candy racer game the virus is mutating in the game. Can Ralph solve the candy racer game and help his new friends or is he doomed when the virus mutates out of control, watch this lovely film to find out. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this. I'm a games nerd so I was delighted to see a lot of retro game characters from various consoles all coming together in one film, I particularly liked the bad guy therapy sessions that Ralph was included in. Like most Disney films this is good old fashioned family fun for all. Gamers and geeks amongst you will enjoy the attention to detail and accuracy of some of the statements and signs littered around the film. There were thrills and spills, action and adventure, and importantly fun and humour everywhere. The world which was presented was a beautifully crafted place which made the film visually appealing. The voice actors all hit the mark, I didn't question the inclusion of any of them and they all delivered. <br/><br/>I've been delighted to read all the top reviews this film has received and I'm happy to add to those by giving this an 8 out of 10."
"mellowo","8","1","2","13 February 2016"," Animated movie of the year
","I criticised Super Mario Bros. as a bad movie adaptation of the video games, so after I reviewed that I decided to write a review of a good movie about video games and I consider Wreck-It Ralph to be among the better ones.<br/><br/>The plot follows a video game villain called Ralph who has served as the bad guy in his video game for 30 years, but he's sick of being a bad guy and decides to leave his game in order to become a hero in another. He ends up becoming a hero by getting a medal in a FPS, but when he's leaving he ends up losing it and is thrown into a racing game and in there he encounters a girl called Vanelope who has dreamed of competing in the race for ages and finally gets a chance to when she steals the medal from Ralph and uses it to enter the race. Ralph learns the only way to get his medal back is to help Vanelope win the race. However, back at Ralph's old game, due to Ralph not being in the game, when their game starts up, Ralph is not there so they are temporarily put out of order, so Ralph is also on a time limit to get back to his old game before it's shut down for good. Scenes seem well thought out and seem to know when they might seem to start to run stale and cut themselves off before it does, with the exception of a couple of scenes. Scenes are also well thought out however a couple of scenes near the beginning there were a few scenes that felt unnecessary. For example near the beginning, Ralph is going through a metro, which is actually the wires running from the back of the arcade machines which all lead to a power source and can go to whatever game they want. The scene when they do this feels unnecessary because the whole 3 minute scene builds up to a joke which I only got a chuckle out of.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is very good. They have a mixture of sets that they experiment with and all of them add to the overall feels that we are in totally different environments as we jump from game to game. When we're in sugar rush, we are in a bright colourful environment with bright personalities but when we're in the fps, we're in a setting that looks a bit like the Alien movies with dark setting and more serious personalities.<br/><br/>The films comedy is mostly good. Most of the jokes work however there were a couple of jokes that I predicted the outcome. One thing I'll admire about the joke department in Wreck-It Ralph is that it doesn't rely on running gags to fill in it's comedic element like most other comedies, instead it relies on mostly thought out humour and light hearted jokes to get itself through and I admire it for that.<br/><br/>The music is well composed but there are a couple of questionable music choices. For example when Vanelope is driving around they chose ""shut up and drive."" That might sound like a good music choice on paper but in my opinion, I don't think it works in it's execution. Apart from that the music is good.<br/><br/>The acting is also good, however none of the acting particularly stood out. The acting was good but I can't really think of any voice actors in particular that gave a noteworthy performance, except for Alan Tudyk as King Candy. He gives off a gr8 comedic voice for a villain that still fits in with the game he's from.<br/><br/>Overall I still really enjoyed Wreck-It Ralph despite the film having a few shortcomings. I would recommend it to nearly everybody I know. Go out and watch this film."
"quincytheodore","8","1","2","24 December 2015"," A sincere tribute to video games and genuinely heartwarming animation
","If you have picked up a controller at any point of your life and liked it, chances are Wreck-It Ralph will entertain your gamer within. Full of pop, retro and gaming references, it's a fun and clever commentary that will be enjoyed by old and young audience alike. Firstly, the poster and trailer show Bison, Zangief and such, but they are only brief cameos, so don't expect Sonic to headline the movie. It's essentially the quest of titular Wreck-It Ralph, a designated villain of 80' arcade game, to obtain much longed acceptance.<br/><br/>The theme is universal, and it will resonate for gamer or non-gamer. In what seems like a video game version of Toy Story, the movie tells a secret consciousness the game characters have inside the virtual realm. After the arcade closes, they will return to their lives, the game is their job, so to speak. There are support group for the villains, bars, and homes, making these digital avatars more humane. Its main characters are different representatives of popular game heroes and villains. Fix-It Felix is similar to Mario, Wreck-It Ralph has Donkey Kong feel, and Sergeant Tamora looks similar to Fem Shepard. I imagine the cost of hiring actual famous characters would be detrimental to their budget.<br/><br/>Story is pretty fast, giving plenty of personalities to the main characters and still manages to snuggle dozens of references. The different gestures, tidbits, and even sound effects are amusing, the alert noise from Metal Gear is gold. Each character has their own style of speech and body language that not only fitting for their stereotype, but also for the voice actors. Fix-It Felix is voiced by Jack McBrayer, the goody two-shoes from 30 Rock, I can literally picture the actual person doing the silly stuffs the on-screen character does.<br/><br/>John C. Riley, the comedian, plays Wreck-It Ralph well and adds his own slightly crude demeanor. Jane Lynch, angry coach from Glee, is my favorite as Sergeant Tamora from the game, Hero's Duty, a comedy mix between two first person shooter giants. Video game isn't just cosmetic appeal in this movie, it has sincere role, and the fact it has many 80' and 90' references gives it a wide range of demographic. The creator shows plenty of respect and knowledge of the source, it's integrated seamlessly and without disrupting the pace of the story. Bountiful and meaningful fanservice made just right.<br/><br/>The movie is simply entertaining and funny with spot-on family value, it's also a homage to video games done right."

","When I first looked at Wreck-it Ralph I was like ""no, not gonna see it, way too childish for me"". But somehow I ended up seeing it anyway - which I did NOT regret! Even though it's animated this movie just got some things not even all ""real"" movies (which would be the not-animated movies) got. The plot is amazing written and the story is sweet with a bit of an edge with a hint of surprise.<br/><br/>I really fell in love with the characters. Ralph is - which is one of the many things I liked the most - hard as a stone on the outside which make him an outcast, but on the inside he's a total sweetheart and he knows it.<br/><br/>All summed up this is an AMAZING movie. Not only for children. Watch it alone, with your friend, your girlfriend/boyfriend, your family or something completely different - the only thing that matters is that you watch it!"

","Wreak-It Ralph is Disney's newest animated film that easily captivates the minds of all ages, and <br/><br/>will excite gamers everywhere.<br/><br/>The story's protagonist is Wreak-It Ralph, the villain of the video game, Fix-It Felix Jr. He is a <br/><br/>large kind hearted fellow with a short temper inside a game where all he does is wreak things, <br/><br/>and gets hated for it. Ralph begins to dream of becoming a hero and sets out to make this dream <br/><br/>come true. But once Ralph leaves his game, he sets off a chain of events that may change the <br/><br/>entire arcade for the worst.<br/><br/>This movie does a great job creating a strong, video game feel. It uses references from old video <br/><br/>games that adult gamers will love, as well as current favorites that will cause children to shriek in <br/><br/>excitement. Any gamer would have tons of fun with this movie with just these references alone, <br/><br/>with appearances from classics like Pacman, and Street Fighter 2's Ryu, to the modern rendition <br/><br/>of Sonic; it really is a treat to enjoy. But while the movie pushes these references in just about <br/><br/>every trailer and advertisement out there, it's actually a solid movie that may survive without <br/><br/>all the video games. The movie even goes so far as to push past video game appearances and <br/><br/>ventures into music, where you can expect to see a special guest appearance from an animated <br/><br/>Skrillex, as well as an exclusive song from this popular dubstep producer.<br/><br/>Just don't expect a video game jumping, franchise exploring epic. This movie only actually <br/><br/>explores two games, and most of the movie ends up taking place in the most annoying game <br/><br/>that could only be described as Candy Land meets Mario Kart. Plus the other main character; <br/><br/>Vanellope von Schweetz, ends up taking over the majority of the movie once introduced. This <br/><br/>wouldn't be a bad thing if she didn't come off as so utterly annoying, although some people <br/><br/>around the theater did find her quite cute. Eventually the movie tries to pick up for lost time for <br/><br/>when Vanellope wasn't in the movie and this causes the story to drag. If the rest of the movie <br/><br/>wasn't so great, this would have killed the movie altogether.<br/><br/>The movie overall was fantastic. People will enjoy the movie's colorful visuals, and hilarious <br/><br/>word play. So while the movie has a few dull moments, it also has a lot of blood pumping <br/><br/>excitement to compensate. The movie really brings back the special feeling the most Disney <br/><br/>movies have lost over the years. So grab your kids, cousins, or just the entire family, because <br/><br/>Wreak-It Ralph gets 9, out of 10"

","Disney was really well played in visual and in storytelling! They've been making different things and surprising me recently, so I've made myself to be the Disney's fans. I like the old fashioned low definition game, but not that much for the shooter game. Well, Disney did it, connecting the fun of both generations. I thought it would be impossible to gain old people's interest to newer games... Here is the point, if someone ask you to read the books that you don't like to, they have their way! And they do the new leap in storytelling! The games are so memorable, and very stimulating, whilst the story of friendship is so touching, it is well arranged and clear. Sometimes the characters faced betrayal, faithfulness, and complicated. Well that's the friendship! Bringing all games together with fun and romance, without breaking the rules of digital world! Wow! They actually added emotions, their heart and souls, trying to think how were they suppose to make me really love to read books without forcing me to do so...They don't took the games just as the games, they took me into the games and feel it, making me though that I'm one of them! It is truly original and creative! I hope that my teachers can do that way, but I'll recommend them, as well as the readers like you to embrace the friendship and enjoy the movie!

"japamo","10","1","2","1 June 2014"," A Left-Out ""Lummox"" Learns About His Place in the (Video) Universe and What a ""Hero's Duty"" Really Means in ""Wreck-It Ralph"",
","or many of the same reasons that the ""Toy Story"" franchise has proved to be an enduring masterpiece, the ""Video Game Story"" ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" (hereafter ""WIR"") is certain to do the same. From seemingly dull-witted, destructive, and vilified ""bad-guy oaf"" Ralph's (John C. Reilly's) simple wish to earn a medal and subsequent respect from other video game characters, WIR explores prejudice, rejection, the need for acceptance and appreciation, compassion for fellow misfits, and the requirements of true heroism. We've been exposed to these lessons before, but WIR is a nostalgically winning, kinetic, and ultimately poignant refresher course.<br/><br/>In particular, I appreciated WIR's subtle reminder not to judge a book by its cover. Resembling a human version of Donkey Kong (no offense, Ralph), Ralph might lead us to the knee-jerk conclusion that if a character is physically impressive, he must be short on brains. Ralph isn't. Especially for a guy whose job it is to demolish a video game penthouse before cheerful carpenter Felix (Jack MacBrayer) can repair it, Ralph is a pretty sensitive, observant, and rational soul. He knows it's not right that the other Fix-It Felix, Jr. characters shun him and relegate him to the nearby dump and won't even invite him in the video game's 30th anniversary party. Ralph has tried support-group villain therapy, but it doesn't really work because the other members are resigned to a fate they think they can't control. Even Tapper (Maurice LeMarche), Ralph's bartender confidant, has no suggestions for breaking out of the rut.<br/><br/>However, fate literally collides with Ralph when he runs into an armored infantryman from the ""Hero's Duty"" war game, who informs him that anyone who breaches a tower in the game wins a medal. Ralph believes that by winning a medal, he can win others' respect. Ralph takes the infantryman's place and, despite his strength, finds it tough sledding handling the non-stop battle to stop a bunch of attacking giant alien beetles (shades of ""Starship Troopers"") AND handling tough, brusque no-nonsense Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun (Jane Lynch). Nevertheless, Ralph manages to scale the tower and win the medal.<br/><br/>Through more ""Hero's Duty"" mishaps, Ralph lands in a fighter-type flyer with one of the alien bugs, zooms throughout the video universe and eventually crash-lands in another video- game, a candy-land race-car game named ""Sugar Rush"". A crafty, sassy, little wannabe racer and ""glitch"" named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) seizes the medal from Ralph and uses it to earn a spot in the ""Sugar Rush"" racing derby. As a ""glitch"", Vanellope finds it hard to literally keep herself together. If she competes in the derby and finishes the race, even if she doesn't win, Vanellope will become a full-fledged, ""unglitched"" video racer.<br/><br/>Although Vanellope is even more of a misfit and pariah than Ralph, naturally the two snipe at and antagonize each other at first. Then Vanellope realizes they can help each other; if Ralph can help her build a race car and train as a racer, she can win back the medal for him as well as achieve her dream. Ralph grudgingly agrees and a close (if still contentious) friendship blossoms.<br/><br/>But Ralph's actions have opened a Pandora's Box of chaos for the video universe. Without him, the Fix-It Felix, Jr. game is out of order and defunct, compelling Felix to join up with Sergeant Calhoun to seek Ralph and the lost flyer/beetle respectively. Some video characters fear Ralph has become like ""Turbo"", a fiendishly rogue racer who has disrupted (and may still be disrupting) other video games. The seemingly kindly and addle-brained King Candy (Alan Tudyk), ruler of ""Sugar Rush"" may have a hidden sinister agenda regarding Vanellope. The beetle Ralph accidentally brought with him to ""Sugar Rush"" may be multiplying and proliferating and threatening Candy Land's existence. Worst of all, as a ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" video image reminds us, a video character who dies outside his game dies permanently. Can Ralph undo the disorder he has wrought and rise above his desires to save not only Vanellope but the whole video universe, even if he has to sacrifice himself?<br/><br/>WIR is an unbridled visual, sensory, and mental delight that again vividly reminds that all beings (even ""bad guys"") have a purpose in the universe, that we all deserve care, attention and respect, and, as Ralph eventually and spectacularly finds out, that finding redemption and heroism means putting others' needs before our own."

","If you like video games, or if you played any kind of a video game anytime in your life, this is a movie that you will most likely love. Various characters from famous titles live in their own game worlds and when the Arcade room is closed at nights, something that most players never thought about happens. You will see several cool references about video games in the movie that will make you smile, that will make you remember that moment in your childhood when you were having so much fun pushing some buttons in a device that brought you into another universe while you were just sitting there. Other than these, Wreck-It Ralph also carefully speaks about friendship and encouragement for both young viewers and elders. A must-see if you are already thinking about which game to play tonight."
"Angels_Review","9","1","2","27 December 2013"," Fun and entertaining, great for the whole family!
","So for all those that really like retro gaming and such, Your going to love this. For those who are into new school games, you will enjoy it too. I know I loved it when I saw even the basic concept of a game like this. You have all manner of games covered; retro, first person shooter, racing, and little hints of other styles of games that don't have a big role in the show. Frankly, I would love if they gave us a sequel if it's made this well, in order to look at the other games.<br/><br/>Anyway, the basic idea to this show was that there is a guy who is always looked down on because he was considered a bad guy. It wasn't that he really was a bad guy, but it was in that he was only programmed to be the bad guy. At least, that's what they all say through the show. I don't know about you, but if my home was suddenly moved to the dump because someone wanted to put a condo on the place I lived, I would be wrecking a few things myself. And now even though he was the main villain and the game would never have any sort of plot without him, he was always shunned and laughed at by the other characters and even Felix. No one gave him respect; they all just treated him like the garbage they thought he was. Something tells me he was getting the short end of the cord no matter what way you look at it. He wasn't like Bowser who always stole the princess just because he wanted to (or in fan fiction, because he wanted to you-know-what with her) or Eggman who wanted to take over the world. He was just a simple person who got his land taken away and was having a temper tantrum. As you watch the show, you find that there are a couple game characters like that even if there are not very many.<br/><br/>I loved how they tried to show the difference between the styles of games; we have at least the background characters of Ralph's world every once in a while jumping from one pose to the next because they didn't have enough sprites to do the in between. Then we have the rather high definition of the first person shooter games where everything was happening rather high resolution and more 'real' as the show aloud. They also have the rather playful cutesy style of Sugar Rush where they had rather bright and colorful candies and characters that will make your sweet tooth ach.<br/><br/>The animation is rather awesome. I didn't find any real hiccups in it at all, probably because it was made for any hiccups to be lost in the show. The textures match the different words that Ralph jumps into from the high res first person shooter to the rather cute and playful racing game. The only one I feel sadly lacks its own identity is Ralph's old game. The characters and surrounding look a little too high res for the type of game it is. Its understandable how they were trying to make it feel a bit closer to all the other worlds but it just felt a little off.<br/><br/>The voices are amazing, each person having the perfect voice for there character although I first cringed when I heard Sarah Silverman, voice of Vanellope. I did grow to like the voice but the sort of rapines that came with it seemed to make the character sound like a smoker rather then a little girl. It's no offense to Sarah though as it wasn't so problematic that it bothered me for the whole movie. It was only when I first heard it that it made me cringe. Jack McBrayer was the perfect voice for Felix, giving him a sort of old school happy voice that was rather gentleman like. It did annoy me on how he would almost censer his 'cussing' but I forgave him because it did make him even more old fashioned and really worked for his character.<br/><br/>All in all, the show was rather delightful and I think everyone should see it at least once. I can't get enough of just how fun and playful it was."

","It is approximately 15 years ago I played the game first time. I have to say time flies. Fix-It Felix now could not be a popular game among the children but it's still in our hearts. I say this movie is amazing because it turns a sort of old boring (comparing with today's games) game into a vivid animation. In this film the game is never inferior than those new games like Sugar Rush and Hero's Duty. And it made the roles much more lovely than they originally are, especially Ralph. A bad fierce guy in the game surprisingly got a mild personality. Game is just a game, people never got a deeply thinking about it, about what could happen if the characters gain different personalities. This film did, and made them cute.<br/><br/>The motivation for Ralph to leave his own game is very simple ""to be a hero, to get a medal"". So there is nothing perfect than Hero's Duty. However accidence happened which also gave Ralph a chance to be a real hero. Although it is only a animation, it gets not a few things deserving adult to think about. Like being reckless with greed, the ending of competing in illegal ways, what the attitude to the honesty and responsibility and so on.<br/><br/>The whole story is complete and consistent, the plots are reasonable and creative, the roles and the voice are awesome, the picture and animation are vivid, and the emotions come from the characters are real and overwhelming. Anyway, you will not regret for your time."

","This film was made for people like me. For anyone who grew up playing video games in the 80's and 90's, here is your childhood in a nutshell... Not only do a lot of your favourite icons make cameo appearances, but the 8-bit and 16-bit graphics are extensively referenced too. Not to mention, the wonderfully dated sound effects and tunes. Even with CD technology nowadays, the music back then knocks most of today's efforts into a cocked hat. As I watched it, and picked up all the small background details and little touches, a tear of nostalgia dribbled down my cheek *SNIFF*. A lot of love and attention went into the making of Wreck It Ralph, and it shows.<br/><br/>Ah, but does the rest of the film match up, you wonder. Glad you asked... the answer is an emphatic YES. The writing is so good... every character is uniquely interesting in their own way, and their interaction with each other is wonderful to behold. Who could have thought a relationship between a cheeky little girl and a huge, clumsy lug could be so effective? And who came up with the idea of matchmaking a sexy, tall female commando with a magic hammer wielding midget? The fact they do, and it works so well, is testimony to a fantastic screenplay, choc-full of action, wit and pathos. It is also mandatory to watch with a big, goofy smile on your face too.<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentleman, I think we have a classic here. (P.S, the short film on the DVD called Paperman. All I can say is WOW.) 8/10"

","""Wreck-It Ralph"" is in my opinion one of the best animated movies of the last few years. It can be compared to other great, recent films from Disney like ""Toy Story 3"" or ""Tangled"". The two are better, mainly because it lacked the amount of touching moments which were great in ""Toy Story 3"" and ""Tangled"". Nevertheless it is still better than ""Brave"" which in turn won the Academy Award instead of ""Wreck-It Ralph"".<br/><br/>The movie tells a story of a arcade game villain who becomes bored of his ""job"" and sets on a journey to prove himself worthy of being a hero. This is a great thing by itself because it shows the great amount of imagination. Throughout the whole movie there are many scenes that depict Ralph dealing with various situations like attending support group, fighting outer space alien bugs or wandering through candy-themed land.<br/><br/>""Wreck-It Ralph"" has got what the good film should have; interesting plot, unusual setting, full-blooded characters, good music and great message to the viewers."

So my past reviews I did two huge TV shows / will smith film / Rain man / a base ball movie with GINGER Geena / two bizarre Johnny Depp films / one about work being like prison even worse and lastly the one with 14 year old Blonde Reese and now this one my 10th review Wreck - It Ralph. <br/><br/>To be honest I thought for sure that the first animated movie i would have reviewed on here would be a Pixar < cause I'm a huge fan of them> examples here are - Toy Story 1 or 2 or 3 or Monsters Inc. / Monsters University ( that i saw the night it came out !!! ) / finding Nemo /a Bugs life and more ..... But before I got a chance to I watched Wreck-It Ralph last night and it steps right up there surprisingly. The movie is about a video game character thats a villain / bad guy in his game wanting to be a Hero and get a medal for once instead of getting thrown in the mudd unlike his co-WORKER Fix-It Felix who always gets the medals and more attention. I have to say the name John C. Reilly sounded familiar to me but i could not put a face to his name but he was outstanding voicing Ralph , I also liked the other 3 Sara Silverman / Jack Mcbrayer and Jane Lynch they all deserve credit.<br/><br/>I loved game central station it was cool to see all the cameos of classic video game characters - It was kinda like a good Deja Vu feeling. It reminded me of Toy Story / Monster Inc. and Who framed Roger Rabbit but in a good way though. It was cool to see all them and even hear there sounds/ audio from there games !!!! so cool I'm not even a super gamer - however I have played a little bit of every game. So I totally saw 100 % accuracy of the characters and made me enjoy it more.<br/><br/>The world of video games has quite the danger , It seems like determination helped Ralph and friendship with Vanellope who was a quirky little character that added to the story. I liked also how Ralph realized he has to be himself no matter what the situation is. I know I mentioned Jane L. but she gave her character attitude enough be different and give the movie a little edge. Felix and her character Calhoun had a great click and were cute and funny too.<br/><br/>SO FINAL RESULT IS - this is a great movie where Ralph has his negatives then positives throughout the movie , has a lot of funny parts , you liked toy story ? then you will like this movie , Great main characters / and comical cameos , The script was excellent and idea was original / I might sound redundant but its everything in this movie i liked and caught my eye. Im shocked this is not from Pixar - However John Lasseter was executive producer so that made me smile as well. Watch this movie its a great a family movie and ranks close to toy story !! key word "" close "" ."

It was like Toy Story at times as I felt it shared some of the same ideas.<br/><br/>Ralph is fed up of being the bad guy in his video game. The only way he can gain respect from the other characters in his game is by winning a medal so he jumps to other video games in search for one. <br/><br/>The different video games we see are very well designed. There are quite a lot of jokes that only video game fans will get but it's still a great watch for all. It was a surprise how many licensed characters were used which was a great plus. It was entertaining through out and was made into a proper story for it would of been easy to make it into a gimmick. They got a balanced of keeping it both relevant to kids and also enjoyable for adults. <br/><br/>John C.

So Ralph just wants to be a good guy as he is not respected that much in his own arcade game. Inorder to do that he has to get a medal. I am not going to spoil too much although I slighty used some spoilers in this paragraph.<br/><br/>Now while watching this movie 2 times, there is some flaws I would like to discuss.<br/><br/>1. The movie doesn't take place in any memorable areas (aside from Pac-Man and other arcade titles) instead the areas in this movie are made-up. And speaking of areas there is really only about 5 (or 6 areas if you count the arcade itself) in this movie and only 3 of them are actually important to the story.<br/><br/>2. The movie duration is really short. Only like a hour long.<br/><br/>3. Some of the most memorable villains in the villain meeting don't even speak (if you don't count Bowser's sound effect 'voice') Now don't let those 3 flaws get to you, it is still an awesome flick to watch and I love some of the cameos of old time friends (Q-Bert, Sonic, Clyde, Pac-Man, etc.) So if you haven't watched the movie yet go get it right now!"

","Directed by Rich Moore<br/><br/>Starring John C Reily, Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch.<br/><br/>Written by Rich Moore, Phil Johnson, Jim Reardon, Jennifer Lee, Sam J Levine, John C Reily and Jared Stern.<br/><br/>'A video game villain wants to be a hero and sets out to fulfill his dream, but his quest brings havoc to the whole arcade where he lives.' As I was watching this film, I kept thinking how predictable it was going to be because all G and PG rated films are these days. But once I was guessing the right way, the film went left and I was very impressed.<br/><br/>'Wreck-it Ralph' was an amazing movie. I loved it. There were so many aspects I enjoyed. Examples include the great effects such as how each arcade serves as a hangout for all the characters during closing time. I found the story behind that similar to Toy Story and Who framed Roger Rabbit. How each toy comes to life as humans leave the scene and how the society of characters in arcades acted as 'Toon Town'. Another effect aspect was how they portrayed the first person shooting game within the game itself. It shows the characters point of view rather than the gamer. It was innovative and awesome. The writing in this film was great. The characters were drawn out so well and the plot twist was something I was not expecting. I salute the writers!<br/><br/>The cast and characters were astonishing! I was surprised with John C Reily. I never would suspect he would be a voice in an animated feature. I love him as an actor but I never paid much attention to his voice, plays really well in this movie. It's quirky, funny and has meaning. Gives a lot to his character. I enjoyed seeing all the characters from old video games including Bowser, Ryu, Sonic, Zangief and Pac Man. It was a joy to look on screen to see all the familiar faces again. The story between Jane Lynch and Jack McBrayer's characters was heart warming and hilarious. I don't want to give away too much information away because it was something I was not expecting and brightened up the whole film for me. My only criticism, which is very small is that all the familiar characters from old video games didn't have much of an impact on the story. Though the story was great, it wouldn't have hurt to add a classic character to the mix.<br/><br/>This film blew me away! The characters, effects and writing all came together to portray one of the best films of the year. It's difficult to find a PG film these days that will satisfy all age levels and this film does just that. A definite must see!"

","'Wreck-It Ralph' is a Disney movie that could easily be mistaken for a Pixar film. It is about Wreck-It Ralph who is a bad guy in an arcade game who is tired of being the villain and leaves his game to get a medal in order to be respected by the good guys in his game.<br/><br/>The film has some great vocal performances by John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch. The story itself is entertaining for both children and adults simply because there are jokes in it that suit both groups. As far as children's films go it is actually quite unpredictable as there are a few revelations and funny scenes that you don't see coming and they take you by surprise. The soundtrack also fits this film perfectly; a mixture of popular songs that everyone will know and enjoy with some other arcade-sounding music that works really well in the fast pacing scenes. <br/><br/>Overall, 'Wreck-It Ralph' is a really nice, heart-warming film that is enjoyable for both children and their parents. There are also lots of funny video game references dotted throughout the film that a few people will get."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","1","2","2 February 2013"," A Sentimental Arcade Adventure With Tons of Style, But Limited Substance
","Cute, family-friendly adventures with a wealth of buried treasure scattered about for long-term arcade denizens. It's a fun twist on the sentimental framework established by Toy Story, but when the sight gags, winks and grins run out it feels a bit thin. The prologue hints at something really dense, vivid, expansive and bright, especially in the bad guys' support group scene that's featured in all the trailers, but the story never truly delivers on that potential. As a small-scale adventure it's just fine, and I certainly appreciated the efforts it made to secure so many cameos from classic gaming characters. It looks great, both in full 3D and pixelated 8-bit facsimile, and the voice acting is a series of loose, warm, top-notch efforts. The concept feels like it never gets fully off the ground, though, and a long layover in one particular game world puts the brakes on what was, until then, a slick, snappy pace. I guess at the end of the day, the comparisons to recent Pixar and Disney epics are inevitable, and it's a clear step or two below that level of prestige. A good, safe effort that's worth a lazy watch, but not exactly what I was hoping for."
"jburtroald95","7","1","2","3 January 2013"," Not exactly a must-see, but the best thing to see with the little ones
","Much has been said of the way that Disney's latest and of this decade greatest animated release portrays the inside world of video games as inventively as Pixar first caught our attention by opening up the world of toys. Indeed, the familiar and invented video game characters featured in Wreck it Ralph move and talk in their off-duty periods just as you would imagine, being sure to please avid gamers just as much as Pixar's first feature delight toy-lovers. The joys of being an arcade favourite are highly prized and quite viciously fought over between games, just like the need to be played with in the toy world. Even more so, the threat of suddenly being deemed defective or dull, and consequently ""unplugged"", hangs ominously over the proceedings. The children in Toy Story were always prone to having fads, novelties, and maturing interests draw them away from formerly beloved toys, but it would still take them a long time to finitely abandon their physically present plastic companions. In the gaming world, it can happen in an instant to any game it seems, apart from classics like Pac-Man. <br/><br/>Both films also have, as a narrative starting point for the main adventures, the visible jealous frustrations of a protagonist who feels unjustly treated. However, while Woody's bitter envy of the effortlessly popular Buzz Lightyear was graspable, but not terribly sympathetic, the plight of the title character of Disney's picture rings immediately with undeniable unfairness and endears us completely to the poor man. Ralph (appropriately voiced by the always endearing John C. Reilly) is the burly villain of the fictional game Fix-It Felix Jr., all day performing the thankless task of smashing a perfectly constructed red brick house floor by floor, so that Felix, the lovable hero, can repair the damage and receive a medal from the ever-so-friendly residents, who then toss poor Ralph off the top floor and into the mud.<br/><br/>In the opening expositional scenes of the film, he shares his misery with his fellow villains at a meeting of Bad Guys Anonymous, and to the audience. He desperately wants the respect and love that the heroes are laden with each day, and becomes convinced that to somehow procure a medal like the ones Felix is always get will see him enjoy these privileges.<br/><br/>To any frequenter of animated children's film the plot point of this superficial quest seems bound for one resolution only: a session of sentimental moralising where Ralph realises that the medal doesn't matter, that it can't buy him friendship that he shouldn't seek to be anything other than what he is. Woody's story went down a similar path, but unlike Woody, Ralph eventually meets an unlikely kindred spirit in his loneliness and torment. Vanellope, a little girl car racer from the aptly named Sugar Rush game, threatens at first to be the writers' self- confessed highly annoying comic sidekick, but is soon shown to be just as much of a sympathetic outcast as Ralph. King Candy, the erratic, word-playing sovereign of this Willy-Wonk-like land of creative confectionery constructions and pricelessly sweet puns has marginalised her as a poisonous glitch in the game, preventing her from racing. A stickler for game conventionalism, he quickly becomes the adversary of the odd couple of heroes, who are also being chased by the stout Felix as well as Calhoun, the fearless, no-nonsense army commander of Hero's Duty.<br/><br/>As lovely as the friendship between the tiny girl and giant man may be, not quite enough time is spent on the entertaining banter and remittent co-operation between the prickly indomitable woman and the smaller, sweeter man at her side. That said, we certainly get a satisfying amount of the wacky King that seems a deviously eccentric cross between Uther Pendragon from the new TV series Merlin and, more obviously the Mad Hatter from Disney's cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland (1951), with the look and voice of that character clearly being an inspiration. Alan Tudyk, who's perhaps best known for playing the naked drugged-up fianc√©e in Death at a Funeral (2007), in many ways emulates Ed Wynn's zany sing- song tones, exaggerating even more the hilarious lisp. He and Sarah Silverman, who, at 42, miraculously reaches the giddy heights of an 8- year-old's voice as Vanellope, were the two unexpected pieces of perfect casting. As expected, John C. Reilly as the gentle Ralph and Jane Lynch, who plays Sue Sylvester in Glee, as the fierce Calhoun are effortlessly brilliant, and it's also a nice surprise to hear the voice of Ed O'Neil as the owner of the arcade.<br/><br/>On top of the humour, the pathos, the quality animation, the action and the clever characterisations, which you'd expect from a director ‚Äì Rich Moore ‚Äì who's worked quite extensively on The Simpsons and Futurama, the visual design of literally several whole universes inside the games world is quite stunning, especially the joyously colourful land of Sugar Rush, but it's really the excitement of the story that makes the biggest impact. It would appear that executive producer John Lasseter has enforced the old Pixar maxim ""The story is king!"" as the graphics, as impressive as they are, are never expected to carry or even save the movie, that job has rightly been given to the narrative. Now that the new digital Disney studio is finally starting to learn a thing or two from the medium's greatest pioneer, let's hope the pupil hasn't outshone the master after the release of Monsters' University, the third consecutive sequel that Pixar has produced this decade."

","Disney's new animated feature Wreck-It Ralph is written and conceived by people who have thought a lot about video games. They have obviously put a lot of thought into what life must be like on the other side of that screen and what they create is a dizzying display of creativity and imagination. They imagine what a fun and colorful world video games must be on the inside, but also what a confining space it must be for your garden-variety villain. How sad can it be if you're station in life is one of violence and destruction. What must life be like if your function is to be hated and reviled over and over and over and over.<br/><br/>The conceit of the film, similar to Toy Story, is that once the arcade shuts down, the characters in the game have some down time. We get a glimpse of the sad, lonely life of Ralph, (voiced by John C. Reilly) a bulky guy with massive hands that function well in a classic video game called ""Fix-It Felix, Jr."", which is not a million miles removed from ""Donkey Kong."" His job is to trash an apartment building, break bricks and smash windows while the game's hero, Felix (voiced by John McBray), tries to fix the building before it crumbles to the ground. Among the tenants of the building, called Nicelanders, Felix is a hero while Ralph spends his nights sleeping outside on a pile of discarded bricks that have accumulated over the years. On the game's 30th anniversary, Ralph is dismayed by the fact that the Nicelanders have invited Felix to a party. When Ralph tries to crash the party, he smashes the ceiling and the doorway just trying to get in.<br/><br/>Ralph goes, frequently, to a support group attended by other video game villains like Clyde, the ghost from ""Pac Man"", Bison from ""Street Fighter"" and Bowzer from ""Super Mario Bros."" His supporters are helpful to explain that just because he is a bad guy doesn't mean he's a bad guy. Ralph shocks the others in the group with the pronouncement that he doesn't want to be a villain anymore.<br/><br/>So Ralph leaves his game behind and decides to get himself some recognition. First trip involves a visit to a ""Halo"" type world where a medal is the top prize and he meets up with a tough-as-nails Space Marine named Calhoun (wonderfully voiced by Jane Lynch) who, we learn, has ""The saddest back-story ever written."" Then Ralph crash lands in a girl's racing game called ""Sugar Rush"" where he meets a sweet-headed character named Vanillope Von Schweet (voiced by Sarah Silverman), a glitched character who is forbidden from being part of the race because the proprietor King Candy (voiced by Alan Tudyk) thinks that her presence will cause players to abandon the game. In this world, the worst thing that could happen is for the game to be deemed faulty, unplugged and retired. One of the great observances is that once video games are retired, some characters like Q-Bert and Coily become homeless.<br/><br/>Most of the movie takes place in the ""Sugar Rush"" world, a candy-coated landscape that keeps getting more and more inventive as the movie goes along. The rolling hills are made of fudge and ice cream, while the trees are suckers and peppermint sticks. Then there are smaller areas as Ralph and Vanellope visit an area of the game that was part of a bonus level that was never finished. Later King Candy gets inside the strange world of the game's programming and does a little creative maintenance. Yes, the movie ends with the inevitable fight to the finish, but the movie is so much fun that it doesn't really matter. What is interesting is the way that the video game world sets up rules for itself that create the drama. Much like Disney's other video game world ""Tron"", there is a danger to spending too much time wandering around.<br/><br/>The best thing about Wreck-It Ralph is that the film's burst of imagination come from the writing, not the marketing department. These writers have played a lot of video games and know what fans might expect. This is probably the best animated feature this year to get a major release this year. It is right up there with Brave in its creativity. It isn't as funny as Hotel Transylvania, but it is much better for your kids than the dreary ParaNorman or the ho-hum Rise of the Guardians. Here is a world so full and so detail and so much fun that you'll want to go back again to catch all the stuff you missed the first time around.<br/><br/>***1/2 (of four)"
"dvc5159","6","1","2","5 December 2012"," When the arcade closes, the games come out and play...
","While watching, I chuckled aloud in the theatre hall, already packed with kids, their parents, and accompanying couples enjoying themselves. But there is a fourth demographic this animated movie is aimed at - the video gamers - and I suspect that most of the audiences are/were gamers themselves at one point in their life. I know I was.<br/><br/>Which was why I was pleasantly surprised at ""Wreck-it Ralph"", Disney's latest CG-animated film, and most certainly there will be more to come. It's an enjoyable treat for kids and adults alike, and if they were avid gamers, extremely nostalgic to see some of the mechanics and characteristics come into play here, if they manage to get past the cameos of other real game characters.<br/><br/>When the arcade closes at night, the games and the characters come to life, interacting among one another. Ralph (appropriately and charmingly voiced by John C. Reilly) is the villain of the (fictional) classic game Fix-it Felix, Jr., and so desperately wishes to be beloved and respected as the hero Felix (Jack McBrayer, whose voice fits Felix to a T) is. When he gets rejected, he leaves his game, in one out of many creative ideas, to look for the sacred hero's medal.<br/><br/>How the screenwriters used this familiar plot device (""Despicable Me"" and ""Megamind"" were two years away) and incorporate it into a series of fantastical and imaginative ideas is pure movie magic. They have created a living, breathing fantasy universe within the video-game realm. I can imagine the number of kids/video game fans screamingly excited at the mere thought of it, and it's brought to life vividly here. It's not everyday you see Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter, and the ghost from Pac-Man, discuss among each other ""Why Being Bad is Good"" in an Anonymous-style meeting.<br/><br/>Ralph doesn't want any of it. And so he ""game-hops"", from a ""Halo""- styled sci-fi shoot-em up led by the spunky Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) to an anime-influenced, syrupy racing game where Ralph meets Vanellope, a feisty but adorable glitch (Sarah Silverman), who is banished by everyone in the game, especially King Candy (Alan Tudyk). One thing leads to another and before you know it, the fate of the arcade rests in the hands of Ralph when enemy bugs from the sci-fi game, which only knows how to consume and destroy, ends up invading the candy racing world.<br/><br/>Sure, I've seen this story before. But this is a fresh, lively and colorful spin to it, thanks to writer/director Rich Moore. The visuals and animation are crisp and top-notch, and the styles of animation and various character designs pull you into the gaming universe even further. Even the difference in game generations is humorously poked at by a terrified Ralph in one scene. The music by Henry Jackman really helped to underscore the zany goings-on throughout the movie. Of course John Lasseter had to be involved. ""Toy Story"" in a video-game world. And it works.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this animated movie a lot more than I expected to. It was funny and exciting at times, it was bright and colorful, and it had a proper and cohesive story to fit the universe, something other video- game to movie adaptations had problems doing. It even has a likable and charming hero (yes) and some really fun supporting characters to boot. Both ""Megamind"" and ""Despicable Me"" tried, but this is the clear winner.<br/><br/>Overall: 78%<br/><br/>Another thing. Go early to see a very charming, classic-like short called ""Paperman"". The whole thing is in glorious black-and-white."
"sford605","10","1","2","3 December 2012"," Wreck-it Ralph is a classic!
","So Wreck-it Ralph came out to theaters on November 2. I'll admit, I'm a huge a Disney fan (seriously, I'm even wearing a Grumpy shirt as I write this). And I also love movie soundtracks. To top it off, I'm a big ol' gaming nerd. Yes, I am very fond of gaming. What's more, I'm a big fan of old school gaming. So when I heard that a Disney movie with a score from Henry Jackman (who has been mentored by Hans Zimmer for years) was coming out to theaters, well I was excited. When I learned it was a movie about old school gaming, well let's just say that I was excited as a dwarf standing three feet in front of a chest full of mithril. So here's a brief description of the movie, which I will then follow up on with my thoughts on the movie. Just so you know, I'm going to keep this description very brief and vague so that if you've already seen the trailers then this won't include any spoilers for you. <br/><br/>Description: Wreck-it Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is 9 foot tall, 600 pound (approximately) bad guy with abnormally large hands in a 30 year old video game in an old arcade. His game is called ""Fix-it Felix Jr."" (named after the star of the game). Ralph is the wrecker whose job is to wreck a building that Felix can then fix with his magic golden hammer. Ralph is tired of just doing his job and being shunned for it. He even goes to a bad guy group therapy session to help deal with the stress. Ralph is so distraught by his situation that he abandons his own game and enters another game. On his travels he meets a young girl named Vanellope (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from the game ""Sugar Rush"". Though at first they appear very different, they realize that they are much more alike than they had at first imagined. Eventually circumstances force the two to work together and they have many grand adventures that forever change both their lives.<br/><br/>Review: So I came in with very high expectations for this movie. When that happens, it's generally very bad for my opinion of the movie. Because if I come in with very high expectations, then even the smallest issues ruin my opinion of the movie. But after watching Wreck-it Ralph, my opinion leaving that theater was actually very favorable. 1. Animation. The animation was quite excellent. I've seen this in 2D and in 3D. Now I've never been a big fan of 3D, but as far as 3D goes, it was quite good. They put a lot of effort into the details as well as the obvious bits, which I think it really important in judging truly excellent animation. They also did a wonderful job in keeping the video game characters' motions similar to how they appeared in their respective video games. This really made you feel as if you were watching your favorite video game characters, rather than just random characters in a movie. 2. Music. There were several songs included in this movie and its soundtrack. Now, while I didn't care for most of the songs, the truth is that they complimented the mood of the movie very well. So while I did not care for Rihanna's ""Shut Up And Drive"", I really did not mind it either. It really did fit the moment. As for the score, it too fit the mood of the scenes in which it appeared. Henry Jackman not only managed to include enjoyable music, but he managed to do so while keeping in the spirit of the video games in which the characters were in. It's definitely not the equal of the How To Train Your Dragon soundtrack, but it was an enjoyable soundtrack. 3. Characters. Nerdy brats, bored assistants, annoying perfectionists, unhygienic brutes, pompous royalty, cranky soldiers... How on earth did this movie include all of these weird characters and yet somehow make you love them? Truth be told, I don't quite know myself. They did though. After viewing this movie I found that I very much liked nearly every character included. They're all interesting, funny, tragic, lovable, or some mix of these. 4. Storyline. So maybe you don't really care about the music. Maybe you just care about the storyline. Well, I've got good news for you. This story is actually very good- albeit at some points predictable. I'm usually very good at predicting movies' story lines. And so while I was able to predict many parts of the storyline, this one still did take me by surprise at some points. 5. Humor/Drama. So Wreck-it Ralph is a very funny movie. I'll admit that there are many parts of this movie that leave me grinning like a moron. But there are actually moments that are just really moving. At some scenes there were literally people crying in the theater. Not me of course. I'm tough like granite so I never cried during any parts of this movie... of course. 6. Child Friendliness. There's some violence and there are some scary scenes. One of the characters says some pretty unfriendly things, but I don't recall anything terribly inappropriate. I would avoid showing this to young children who are easily frightened. Other than that, I'd say it's pretty good for kids.<br/><br/>Summary: Wreck-it Ralph is a beautiful movie full of humor and emotion. Definitely worth seeing in theater. If you don't feel like seeing it in theater, then certainly rent it. You won't regret it!<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10 stars"
"follis12","8","1","2","28 November 2012"," Very creative kids movie - but probably a bit ""out there"" for some
","Wreck-It Ralph is definitely appropriate for children and lovers of video games. It is exciting, colorful, and easy to follow. They even left out some of the usual adult oriented innuendo. <br/><br/>Parents may enjoy the nostalgia of the video arcades. It reminded me of when video games were simple, and my imagination ran wild with possible story lines and personalities of the characters. <br/><br/>The story is built around a parallel universe where video game characters exist and interact with one another - sorta Tron like. It is very creative, and overall I was very impressed. If you are looking for an entertaining movie for the family, you can't go wrong with this one."
"lasttimeisaw","7","1","2","18 November 2012"," Wreck-It Ralph
","A 3D cinema-going for the weekend of this latest Disney animation (by the luckiest chance I found one in its mother tongue). Being mainly ignorant towards the video games territory, which surprisingly did't impede my joyous time with this well-manufactured cartoon.<br/><br/>Disney has cleverly introduced a novel space of wonders (especially towards the 1980-1990 generations who are the mostly reminiscent of the 8-bit video games era), and has conjured up a magical and colorful world with our anti-hero, Wreck-it Ralph, a villain in his game arcade pining for the penthouse life and admiration which belongs to the customary hero (Fix-it Felix). Then the storyline meanders into a default hiccup when Ralph is devoted to grab a medal to alter his villainous destiny, which for me is a bit befuddling (perhaps due to my void of background information) and stands as the low point of the film (for me at least), nevertheless, when the chief setting alters to the saccharine Sugar Rush, the film also speeds up by introducing our anti-heroine, Vanellope, a girl glitch in the game's system, who has her heart set on winning the race car competition and becoming a regular member of the game. A natural bond between these two unorthodox characters has slowly connected, with some unexpected twist in the plot (which is supposedly looming during the mid-time but executed with a quite cogent measurement). Friendship has to be tested, and a final battle is in the offing, a foreshadowing Alien-esque invasion looks like a proper payoff. <br/><br/>The sidekicks are a tad less interesting compared with Disney's other ventures (and don't be deluded by the poster, most of the fringe characters on it have only cameos in the film) notwithstanding, the great technique of the picture (the 3D effects are also aptly conducted, at least I didn't feel giddy this time) and a not-too-star-studded but pleasantly ear-friendly voice cast should be felicitous compensations (I had put my high hope in Jane Lynch but the high point must be granted to Sarah Silverman). Thus, seriously it is a potent contender for the BEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM.<br/><br/>p.s.: there was an opening 7-minutes black and white animation short PAPERMAN (2012, 8/10) by John Kahrs which is also an exquisite treat for its romantic context."

The movie takes me back to the old days when graphics wasn't key when making a video game, just fun. I loved seeing M Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter.<br/><br/>We all struggle with accepting who we are or accepting the purpose for which we are created, and that is what Wreck It Ralph is all about accepting yourself for who you are and being proud of it.<br/><br/>My high in this movie is the support group for video game villains, all the villains had issues with being tagged as the bad guy.<br/><br/>The movie had been in production since the 80s but had been pushed back a lot, but finally Disney went ahead and just like Who Framed Roger Rabbit 1988 Disney featured a lot of cameo characters from many video games like Clyde the orange ghost from Pac-Man, Doctor Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog, and Bowser from Super Mario Bro.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by Reilly) is a character in a video game, he is the bad guy and the games protagonist and his antagonist is the game's perfect Good Guy, Fix-It Felix (voice of McBrayer).<br/><br/>Ralph is fed up of being the bad guy, as he wishes he too could get a hero's medal, so when he runs into a first person shooter game character that was running out of his mind, Ralph took the advantage of the knocked out character, took his gear and set himself up to be used to accomplish the games objective so as to get a medal.<br/><br/>Things took a turn for the worse when Ralph found out that the character he was impersonating was in a game that was wild and dangerous, he panicked wrecked the gameplay and while the others were resetting for another run, Ralph broke all protocols as he went after the medal, he so desperately craved.<br/><br/>The craving led to him breaking into another arcade game meeting Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Silverman), a young troublemaking ""glitch"" from a candy-coated cart racing game, who turned Ralph's life around and showed him that there is more to life than his selfish ambition of being accepted by everyone.<br/><br/>Wreck it Ralph is directed by Rich Moore who is best known for his work in the Simpsons.<br/><br/>Rich Moore dropped an idea that he and Disney may do a sequel that may cross in to online and console gaming.

","I'll keep this brief. I grew up in and help create the arcade generation, and so I had high hopes for this movie. Sadly it seems they could only afford a couple of licenses so most of the games are made up or obscure. There are so many games that should have been in there (reply with your lists!) but instead you get a version filled with apparent 'Chinese knock off' games.<br/><br/>Why is that important to this film? Well, frankly it is the weak script and writing. It is all so standard nowadays and I saw so few deviations since the first CG kid movies coming out started. You can apply this formula to almost any kids movie in the last decade:<br/><br/>1. Loser needs to prove self. 2. Loser has love interest. 3. Loser gets quest 4. Loser disappoints everyone. 5. Loser redeems self. 6. Happy ending with pop music.<br/><br/>(Try applying this formula to any CG film and you'll see it fits quite well)<br/><br/>Seriously, are the writers in Hollywood THAT lame now? For God's sake, somebody do better than this garbage so another country deserves the profit for a change.<br/><br/>Other than that all the cast do a great job and the animation is of course top notch (I must admit that at least).

Asteroids 6. Space Invaders 7. The Phoenix 8. Scramble 9. Gyrodine 10. Hard Drivin' (EDIT - #11. R-Type! How could I forget that?! Okay, you could have had the bug monster from it or something.... Maybe #12. Operation Wolf too....)<br/><br/>Mind you... I am just wondering if I am assuming that I was in the arcades when the games in the movie appeared... Why would kids today relate to things in my 80's childhood? (Damn, now I hate this movie even more now because I feel old)."

","Me and a friend went to this movie and were highly disappointed! The previews are funny and cute, but when you start watching it just gets dull. They got all the aspects of the arcade down and how things travel and so forth, so you were never lost, well for what i saw anyways. I walked out part way through the movie. The main thing that i got from the movie is Disney was pushing a lesson on kids, like they always do, except in this case, i didn't like the message that was introduced. To me it seemed that ralph was unliked and seen as a mean guy because of his appearance and the fact that he didn't have a medal. To me its not something i would want pushed on to children, then again maybe the ending teaches something completely different, i just wasn't going to wait for that."

"lee_eisenberg","5","1","3","13 February 2017"," Have you got time to Wrecktify all the things that you should...
","First, I should say that I prefer animated short films (namely the old Looney Tunes cartoons) to the animated features. Second, I wouldn't call myself a fan of Disney movies. Nonetheless, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" isn't a bad movie. Like ""Toy Story"", it depicts man-made objects - in this case video arcade games - coming to life when humans aren't around. While the good guys from the games get sycophantically celebrated, the bad guys feel cast out and just want to get accepted. Perfectly understandable that they'd want this. As with ""Monsters, Inc"", the world of these non-human individuals is made to look like another version of the human world: the plug socket is a video game version of Grand Central Station. Basically, the tykes can enjoy all the silly stuff while the adults can laugh at the references to the real world.<br/><br/>And of course I can't avoid mentioning the cast. We all know who John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch and Ed O'Neill are. I had seen Jack McBrayer in a number of movies and TV shows but hadn't learnt his name until now. Alan Tudyk also voiced the Duke of Weselton in ""Frozen"" and more recently appeared in ""Trumbo"". I loosely know about Mindy Kaling's work. Dennis Haysbert is known for ""24"" but also played the love interest of a 1950s suburban wife in ""Far from Heaven"". Edie McClurg often appeared in John Hughes's movies and notably received a profanity-laden rant from Steve Martin's character in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"". The rest of the cast includes Laraine Newman (one of the original ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members) and Maurice LaMarche (Egon on ""The Real Ghostbusters"").<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'd say that you'll probably like the movie.<br/><br/>PS: Litwak is an anglicization of the Ukrainian name Litvak."
"Howlin Wolf","6","1","3","6 January 2014"," Starts out with a good idea... but then wrecks it, in favour of the traditional 'quest for redemption' journey...
","I was enjoying the almost Bergman-esque angle of a bunch of video game characters and their search for self-worth, and a strong identity... but alas, then it tossed away those themes to focus on a more straightforward path that was largely preoccupied with achieving goals...<br/><br/>Don't introduce interesting subplots, if you aren't then willing to follow those threads, all because you have to get back to your far less interesting (to me, anyway... ) conventional 'main plot'... <br/><br/>Don't get my hopes up if you're just going to whet my appetite, but then leave me with very little that is satisfying. <br/><br/>Plenty of films have a disposable plot, or narrative where the vast majority of it is just a selection of major characters goofing around (""Clerks"" might be considered one, ""Be Kind Rewind"" might be thought of as another... ) Sure, the execution may vary, and not all of them may work (""Be Kind Rewind"" doesn't, really... ) but you'll never know unless you try to build a story around that setup. The issue here for me is that the most interesting line of thought in the movie was given the least exploration and screen time. I would far rather watch an interesting 20 minute short based around popular video game characters, than an anticlimactic full-length movie about original characters who are much less captivating (again, to me... ) <br/><br/>I would have been happy to go along with the original storyline, if only I had not been shown something better, which was then abandoned to follow a formula that is common to 95% of movies that are already out there."

","About 3 months ago me and my mom along with my brother decided to go to see Wreck It Ralph in the cinemas.<br/><br/>The movie chronicles on a villain named Ralph voiced by Stepbrother star John C Reilly,who is celebrating his 30th anniversary as the bad guy who always breaks things and his nemesis Fix It Felix JR has to fix what Ralph breaks with his big gigantic hands,but Ralph is so sick of being treated like a villain and he wants to be treated like the good guy. Oh does THAT sound FAMILIAR e.g Megamind,Despicable Me etc. So he travels to each game to prove to the other video charcthers like Fix It Felix Jr voiced by that guy that featured in that Mariah Carey Video Touch My Body and the others who were with Ralph at the meeting about the gaming world in the beginning of the movie that he is a good guy. Ralph soon enters a world that's like Halo and meets up with a female captain voiced by Glee Star Jane Lynch called Calhoun and later meets a quirky young girl called Vanellope who is really a glitch in the ever so colorful world of Sugar Rush which is like Mario Kart Racing or is she. And of course there is also a villain who isn't know until the very end of the movie but you will be surprised who it is?<br/><br/>So lets talk about what I like about it well first is the animation. The animation is brilliant in this movie,its colorful,its dark and the charcther design is fantastic especially on Wreck It Ralph who looks almost like Shrek's human form in Shrek 2. Also the charcthers are really cool as well and it was cool to see a cameo of Sonic The Hedgehog in the beginning of the film. Now to the bad of this movie and I have to say the story and the voice acting. Don't get me wrong I do like the story but it started off great and then it went down hill and the voice acting I hated the voice actor who voiced Vanellope Sarah Silverman,I dunno why but she didn't really sound that great at all they should have had someone with a sweet voice doing her like Mandy Moore or Anne Hathaway for example. She just sounded like someone on crack to me. <br/><br/>Another thing is that for Disney's 52nd animated feature after Disney's 51st Winnie The Pooh and Disney's golden age flick Tangled,it didn't feel like a Disney movie to me at all,IN FACT it looked more like a film that Pixar would make. Also I think Brave should have been Disney's 52nd and not this movie but hey that's my opinion. <br/><br/>In my honest opinion I did enjoy this movie but my mom and my brother hated it so much,even my brother got scared at the Halo scene cause it was too dark and creepy. But in saying that I prefer Disney's 50th over Disney's 52nd maybe I wasn't the target audience for this movie,but in my opinion i'd watch it a few more times and that would be it.<br/><br/>For me I'm giving it a 6 out of 10."

","Disney's latest animated adventure is a wild ride that nerds and boring people alike will find irresistibly fun! But ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is ultimately for the gamers, who will likely have more fun chuckling at all of the clever in-jokes and cameo appearances by famous video game characters. Beneath it all is a plot-structure older than Atari, but it's the shiny box the story comes in that makes it so desirable. John C. Reilly voices Ralph, a video game villain who longs to be loved and appreciated, desiring more for himself than his angry job description dictates He game jumps (Gasp! What will his home game do without him?) in search of a way to become a hero, and in doing so meets new friends and risks his life (if you die outside your home game, you die for good) to give them a better one. Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch, and Jack McBrayer also offer their voices to this high-energy sugar rush that gives life to impossible characters and situations in an exhilarating way that no one has done since Pixar dunked us deep into the waters of Australia.<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond"

","Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph , the villain in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy.<br/><br/>I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever ‚Äì a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.<br/><br/>So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than All the recent animated movies so far.<br/><br/>I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D. The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.<br/><br/>The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.<br/><br/>It's a classic no doubt, and Wreck-it Ralph will be one of those movies on my ""favorites"" shelf for decades to come. The true triumph? Wreck-it Ralph feels like that classic game that has been a part of my childhood ever since I can remember; the type of classic where you throw hundreds of quarters away and you honestly just don't care, because it is just that good. Highly recommended, and a 10 out of 10 for me, as I expect this will be my short list of favorite movies for years to come"

","When I first read the summary, I thought it'd be an interesting watch; especially because as an 80's child, I highly enjoy any reference to the good old arcade games. I was a little bit disappointed that there weren't more of them, however; but not as much that I couldn't enjoy the brilliance of the movie.<br/><br/>The best thing for me would have to be the characters from the ""Fix it Felix Jr"" game moving just like the old 8-bit characters moved in the real games: those unnatural jerky movements. I found that little detail endlessly entertaining. The graphics were very good, especially when we were shown ""Hero's Duty"" and ""Sugar Rush"". Vanellope was adorably done and I just know that if I'd been a kid still, I would have fallen utterly in love with (the sweets in) her (hair).<br/><br/>I did find some parts of the movie a bit long and I was disappointed that over half of the movie was built around Sugar Rush.<br/><br/>But apart from that: solid story, solid graphics, lovable characters and references to a few 80's Arcade Games. Definitely worth to see!"

"MartinHafer","6","2","12","1 March 2013"," A lot to like--a lot to annoy---it's a real mixed bag here.
","""Wreck-It Ralph"" is incredibly inventive and enjoyable--or at least MOST of the film. Up until the movie neared the end, I would have scored this one an 8--it was that good. But, the ending managed to annoy me and create a lot of ill-will in me.<br/><br/>The film worked very, very well in several ways. Seeing the arcade characters on their 'time off from work' at the end of the day was GREAT. In fact, I wish I'd seen more of this--especially the homages to classic arcade games like Sonic and Q-Bert. It also had amazing graphics. But, it also seemed to have too much story--way too much story. And, at the end, just about every clich√© known to Disney (even including the Disney Princess notion!) was tossed in--and destroying much of the momentum in the movie. Then, all the inventiveness was gone--and it a by-the-numbers film that just stopped being fun when the whole race plot began. Overall, a very mixed bag. I loved most of it but cannot heartily recommend it. My advice? See it once. Or, if you are a little kid and can watch formulaic Disney fare again and again, then by all means watch it until your brain drips out your ears. This should have been a lot better--it's as if Disney was more concerned about marketing than providing a top-notch film."

","From the get-go, I really enjoyed this film. It was a clever premise, that computer game characters are real and interact with each other. The characters were well drawn, fun and endearing. Typical children's film in that it speaks to the underdog and outcast being the hero, and friendships being formed unlikely places. For children, to be sure, but certainly enough in it for adults to enjoy. Really enjoyable, entertaining and laugh out loud funny in places. Great voice-actor performances from an all-star cast including John C Reilly, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman and the design of the entire film is in the style of many video arcade games, which is clever. Lots of little in-jokes and asides for gamers to enjoy."
"OllieSuave-007","5","1","4","25 June 2015"," Video Game Rush!
","Disney's 52nd full-length animated feature film takes us to the video game world, where villain Wreck-it Ralph is tired of being the bad guy and living in the dumps. He wants to be a hero so he could join his ""hero"" friends in their upscale pad and, therefore, seeks to become one by obtaining a medal. However, he inadvertently causes a virus to be unleashed in the central game console, threatening all the games in the arcade.<br/><br/>I thought the idea of an animated movie about video game characters was a clever touch from Disney; it was interesting to see what the video game characters with their time after the arcade closes (like the toys coming to life after the kids leave in the Toy Story movies). They travel back and forth to their own versions of meeting rooms, bars and penthouses through stations, which in real life are the areas behind power outlets. It was also interesting seeing famous video game characters come to life like Sonic, King Koopa and Pac-Man. This gave the film a very intriguing start and draws you into the story and the plot of the virus invading the entire arcade. However, I thought all the hype and tension faded away when Ralph enters the Sugar Rush candy game and meets the bubbly but overzealous and annoying Vanellope, who wants Ralph to help her win a car race. This plot element consumed a huge part of the movie and overshadows the virus threat story. I may be in the minority on this, but I think the film would have been much more fun if the virus plot was emphasized more and actually showing all the arcade characters in danger or contributing to the mission of destroying the virus. It's too bad the more famous characters like Sonic, Mario, Koopa, Pac-Man and others weren't given larger and more significant roles in the film (I'd prefer the filmmakers use those over some of the main characters used).<br/><br/>The animation was nicely done, giving you a very video-game feel and reminding you that Disney animated movies have really come a long way. I didn't care much for the rock music soundtrack or the Sugar Rush plot, though, and I thought the film had limited suspense. I do like the Ralph character and his purpose in the story, but it's really just a big car race and a search-and-destroy movie, with too much of an emphasis on the candy stuff.<br/><br/>Grade C-"
"christophe92300","6","1","4","27 February 2013"," Enjoyable
","The concept of Wreck-It Ralph is excellent but the end result maybe didn't live up to the expectation. Seeing the poster for example, one might think that the movie will really feature the characters of the classic video games, but ultimately there are only a few interactions with them and you can count their scenes on the finger of one hand.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is enjoyable despite the fact that the script revolves mostly around the Sugar Rush universe, which isn't bad, but maybe didn't deserve that much room in the story.<br/><br/>The dialogues are rather well written, and a few puns and product placements smartly add a fun touch to the scenario. Unfortunately, the movie maybe lacks a bit of a more adult humour, more caustic probably, or different layers of interpretation like some Pixar productions managed to do."

","I must say that ""Wreck-It Ralph"" was something different than most other animated movies I have seen in quite some time. The whole aspect of the characters on the arcade machines coming to life in their own worlds once the arcade halls close down for the evening was quite interesting. And it was nice, for a gamer since the early 1980's, to recognize characters from the many different games.<br/><br/>The story in ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is fairly straight forward, though awfully predictable. About Ralph, the villain from a golden oldie arcade wanting to be a good guy and sets out to get win a medal to prove his heroism in another arcade game. But his well-intended efforts end up proving to have catastrophic ripples in the land of the arcade, as virus bugs threaten to take over.<br/><br/>""Wreck-It Ralph"" offers a good amount of likable characters that are nicely animated and fleshed out on the screen. They are given good personalities and they had a good ensemble of people on the list for the voice acting.<br/><br/>The animation in the movie is good, as to be expected from a Disney production.

","Wreck-It-Ralph is a cute animated movie from Disney about a video game bad guy who decides he wants to be good. In the video game world that is created here, characters are shown to be like actors and actresses in a studio, playing roles for the benefit of their quarter carrying customers - generally preteens. Anyway, this I thought was fun. So Ralph is like an actor fed up with playing bad guy roles. Rather than wreck things, he wants to be a hero for a change. Built like the incredible Hulk, he yearns to be able to use his strength and wrecking power to do good, not bad. The plot then is built around finding a way for Ralph to be able to be this hero.<br/><br/>The set up is engaging. Ralph find he can't really be the hero he wants to be in the game he is presently playing, so he ""walks out"" and enters some other games in the same arcade. Meanwhile, we go behind the scenes to a place that looks like Grand Central Station where game characters come and go, mingle, and spend their spare time when not ""on the set"" i.e. not playing their game roles. In other words, when no quarters are inserted in the machines, Ralph and other ""cast members"" can be found ""backstage"" like actors taking breaks. Its all kind of cute in a way. And with the set up the way it is, it also makes possible migration of characters to different games. This is where the plot takes off. Also, when game characters leave their game for whatever reason, the game is declared ""out of order"" and all characters are affected (i.e. put out of work like being laid off). So, this is the world we are introduced to here, and is what makes the story function and have some logic to it.<br/><br/>OK, so Ralph leaves his game, putting it out of commission, and searches for one where he can be a hero. His first try fails, but in his second attempt, he meets an unfortunate but engaging little girl trapped in a CandyLand type game called ""Sugar Rush"" who is in need of a hero. Meanwhile, his fellow characters from ""wreck-it-Ralph"" come looking for him. Also, some insect like monsters he inadvertently unleashed in his first alternate game get transported to CandyLand also where they eventually wreak havoc. So, in the end Ralph gets to be the hero he craves, saving his little girlfriend while defeating the villains, both imported and ""indigenous"".<br/><br/>And so what we end up with here is a little morality play about good and bad and how love can change everything. You see Ralph is a big crude dude and no one loved him in ""Wreck-it- Ralph"". But in ""Sugar Rush"" he is able to get a fresh start, find love, and put his wrecking power to positive use. And so eventually we learn that Ralph is a softie at heart and simply needed some love to feel good about himself. In the end, the hero's medal he craved takes a back seat to the love he found during his quest for that medal. Thats good as I didn't want him to become ""good"" just because he found himself a little piece of gold to hand around his neck. It was looking that way for a while...<br/><br/>Anyway, I am not a gamer, but you can see that throughout the movie there is much homage being played to gaming. The plot is well thought out with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. And the journey through CandyLand was fun with lots of humor thrown in as characters stumble across the sweet landscape. So, all in all, throw in some good music and visuals, and I found the whole trip entertaining.<br/><br/>And if you remember ""The Wizard of OZ"", expect to see some references and parallels to it in Ralph's journey through CandyLand. Its as though Ralph traveled to OZ in search of a wizard (King Candy) to give him a medal only to find that through love and good deeds, he earns it naturally. Same lesson - you don't get something for nothing. I think it was on purpose that we come to wonder at first if Ralph can be ""good"" simply by stealing medals not belonging to him. No, he has to earn them, and eventually he does."

","Earlier today, I saw this movie at my local movie theatre and all throughout, I was entertained.<br/><br/>I like the film's idea of what video game characters do when the arcade closes down, which reminds one of the concept of Toy Story. Needless to say, Disney and Pixar (in spite of the former's flaws) have managed to answer some questions like this very well. Unlike Over the Hedge, this film has actual reasons to sympathize with the main character by giving the audience legitimately good reasons to understand him.<br/><br/>I normally do not see modern computer-animated movies at a theatre, mainly because I feel that a lot of ""modern"" children's movies (with some exceptions) often have loads of innuendo and toilet humour, but this one I had anticipated ever since I saw the trailer. I am a huge fan of Disney and Pixar movies, but a lot of DreamWorks films (except Shrek 1, 2, Bee Movie, Monsters vs. Aliens, Prince of Egypt and The Road to El Dorado - the latter in 2D animation) I find intolerable The movie has its share of funny moments and the little kids sitting behind my almost 21-year-old brother, my 14-year-old sister and I didn't seem too disappointed. Luckily, it was more witty dialogue and visual jokes than toilet humour (which is strictly verbal and is limited to a couple scenes) Unfortunately, I cannot go into detail because then I might spoil the movie for whoever is reading this. I warn you that a lot of it won't really make sense unless you play a lot of video games (or just know the popular ones very well)."

"The-Sarkologist","6","0","1","8 February 2019"," Life inside the Video Arcade
","There is basically two reasons why I ended up watching this film: the first being that my brother wanted to see the second film, and when I watched the second film there was so much about it that didn't make sense I really felt that I needed to watch this one to actually understand some of the subtleties that was going on in the second one, such as why some super-mario bros type of character was actually married to this character that looked like she had come straight out of Halo.<br/><br/>Well, things now make a lot more sense, and they certainly explain how this rather unusual relationship came about. You see, in the world of Wreck it Ralph, the characters are all characters in video games. During the day they simply play their parts, however at night, when the arcade shuts down, they all go about doing their own things. The problem is that because Ralph is a 'bad guy' he sort of gets left out, and he also lives in a garbage dump.<br/><br/>The problem is that Ralph actually isn't all that bad a guy. He's actually quite nice, it is just that not only is he somewhat misunderstood, but he is also quite lonely. However, it seems that nobody really wants to give him a chance, so he decides that he will go and get himself a medal, which he actually manages to do, namely by going into this Halo style game. The problem is that one of the bugs from this game escapes into a third game, and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>The thing is that there is a lot more going on behind the scenes besides Ralph wanting to get this medal and earn the respect of the other characters in his game. The problem is that characters aren't supposed to cross games, because if they do it is believed that the game is faulty, and the game is then unplugged and shipped off. Well, that is bad news for the characters in the game because when that happens, if they don't get out of the game then, well, they die. However, if they do get out, then they are basically homeless.<br/><br/>This was a rather fun movie, though a part of me felt that it did drag a little bit too much. In a way it is your typical Disney film, though it turns out that it also has a not too typical Disney princess (though Venelopee isn't an official princess so we probably can't actually call her one). As I mentioned, there is more going on than just the bug, and the medal. In fact, it turns out that there is a rather interesting twist in the film, and it does lead up to it quite well, with a few comments, and some explanations, going on in the lead up to the big reveal.<br/><br/>I guess this is one of the things I did like about this movie, and that is that it starts off going in one direction, and suddenly you find it moving towards a completely different ending with a completely different conclusion. However, there are also multiple plot lines as well, which all converge rather well. Yeah, it was somewhat slow to start, and a little annoying, but it did actually end quite well."

The typical classic Disney's way of establishing insecurity is to let us audience feel and experience what the characters feel and experience throughout the story. This time Disney truly fails me for they are trying to show what the character's feeling through
DESCRIPTIVE dialogue. TRULY UNBELIEVABLE!
What an innovative and ground breaking move, Disney!
The only heartfelt moment I can recall is when they have to be separated. That's the only truthful moment in this movie. The rest? CHEESELY FABRICATED!

","Wreck-It Ralph sees Disney trying to go the Pixar route before they decided to buy the company. It is a brisk colourful animation taking a retro look at arcade games. However the makers saw too many Pixar films because you can easily guess who the real villain really is going to be as it follows the Pixar beats too closely and adds some Disney mush to it as well.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is the villain in an old 8 bit arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr. It really is a thinly disguised version of Donkey Kong. Ralph though has had enough of being a villain with no character development. He does not even get invited to the game's 30th anniversary party that Felix and his crew throw.<br/><br/>Out of the game Ralph is a nice but clumsy guy who just wants to join in with the others but the villains of the arcade games tend to be ignored.

","Let's start of by saying I played some video games back in my day¬Ö I was quite the MASTER at being the second player and not knowing all the cool combos. I was the KING at complaining and whining that I didn't know any of the moves and characters. I was very SKILLED at handling my remote while I waited for my turn to play because my friends never died.<br/><br/>Even though I was not a gamer and I played only sometimes, I still saw some familiar faces in this movie (cameos galore). I recognized some cool video game characters that I was glad to see.<br/><br/>Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... I liked it. Well actually I liked the second half of it. The first half was a bit slow and very establishing and fact filled, which is necessary but well, boring.<br/><br/>I always have a favorite side character in a movie and in ""Wreck-It Ralph"" the award goes to Sarah Silverman. As soon as she came into the picture the movie really began for me. This has nothing to do with my crush on Sarah Silverman. She actually did a great job playing an adorable little girl with a bit of a lovable potty mouth, not her usual role. <br/><br/>The only game I play is ""Call of Duty"" nothing else really interests me but hot damn I really hope they make some of the games they showcased in this movie. ""Sugar Rush"" looked like wicked fun.<br/><br/>Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says¬Ö The marketing of this movie was not so hot. The posters are all wrong. The characters displayed are not the major players so don't expect anything from it. And the other poster with Ralph's 8 bit face? Even worse! This is one of the few movies I have seen without watching the trailer first and there is a reason for it. Digitally animated movies have the worst trailers. Challenge me on it I dare you! ""UP""? ""Finding Nemo""? They tell you nothing about the sentimental value they offer just a bunch of gags and slapstick! I mean find one good digitally animated movie trailer out there! Oh wait, I did it for you, it's this one. I avoid these trailers like math and now that I saw it I can honestly say they did a pretty good job.<br/><br/>The digital animation itself was not over the top either not too flashy not too fast and in your face. They had to really slow it down for the video game sequences and this forced the filmmakers to keep a nice flow. <br/><br/>Jack ""The Parent"" says¬Ö duh? Take the kids! They will enjoy the wreck out of it! Like what I did there? They will enjoy it more if they have played video games. They will enjoy it more if you cry like a baby during special scenes and they look at you like you are some weird monkey donkey. Yeah it has some scenes so be careful if you are a softie!<br/><br/>On a side note there is a lot of name calling (they do it in a cute way) and some punching in the face violence (also done in a cute way) just had to throw it out there for you I mean my kids can take it and we all love that stuff but you never know."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","10 July 2016"," Surprisingly good story and not just a gimmick movie
","A rather big racket was raised when we first heard that Disney had acquired the rights to all these classic video game characters and was in the process of making a movie about them. What was the story going to be right, were our beloved characters going to be treated fairly, who was going to be in it? Well, as it turns out, we barely get to see any of them. Most of the good parts were in the trailers. And, in my opinion, that's good.<br/><br/>This is an original story, utilizing mostly original characters and fictional video games, but with a background of classic games and characters. And that feels right. The story is set in an arcade, where after the lights turn off for the night, the various characters from all of the games gather and spend time together. One of these characters is Wreck-It-Ralph, from the made-up game Fix-It- Felix, Jr. - a pretty blatant Donkey Kong rip-off, but in a loving manner. Villains are treated with quite a large amount of disdain by the other characters, and Ralph feels like he doesn't get the respect he deserves. He is in many ways the second most important character in the game, but the others treat him like dirt. So he leaves, trying to find recognition elsewhere.<br/><br/>And from thereon out it's exactly what you've come to expect from Disney. Great characters, great visuals, good morals and lessons, exciting adventures and even a decent twist near the end. Ralph meets a young racer girl character named Vanellope in his travels and these two are very funny together. Ralph's way more gruff and jaded, but also somewhat wiser because his game has been around for so much longer, whereas Vanellope is much more willing to push the boundaries and able to roll with the punches, never letting anywhere stop her.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film? No. Personally I'm somewhat disappointed that we only get to see three games, when we had to whole arcade to explore. From the story point of view it makes sense because it always takes time to establish a new setting, but it still feels like they didn't explore all the possibilities. The secondary characters, mainly Felix and his love interest, are also somewhat boring in my opinion, though they have their moments as well.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's still overall great entertainment and an excellent addition to the Disney canon."
"datautisticgamer-74853","7","0","1","21 May 2016"," As lackadaisical as my experiences watching it were, it's easily the best film based on a video game so far
","By lackadaisical, I meant that it was cycling between undeniably exciting and neutral moments that bordered disappointed, tedious anticipation. Wreck-It Ralph, while not based on a real game (the game was made by Disney themselves as a promotion, not in 1982 by... whoever), has plenty of moments where I expected something to happen, but my anticipation was a bit exceeded by what ended up being offered. It redeems itself by offering beautiful animation that simultaneously feels like actual game sprite renders or watching someone play the game (Calhoun was F****N badass, just like her influence Samus Aran), great character development, and a moral that you wouldn't expect in a film centered around or based on a video game. Somehow, with the way that they merged the world of arcade games, they made it seem both obsolete (but in the classic way, like you can always come back to it, rather than outdated) and up to date. The gags were funny half of the time, and other than that, it's another mixed bag of a Disney feature that just does things better than other mixed bags. Check it out even if you don't game or have never gamed in 1982 or later."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","8 April 2016"," The Story Of A Regular Guy Just Looking For A Little 'Wreck-ognition'
","The year of 2012 was a wicked one for both Disney & Pixar as the two animation studios attempted to emulate the other one's forte in their very own features. Pixar's Brave marked its first foray into fairy tales, a subgenre that Disney pretty much owns, while Disney's Wreck-It Ralph employed Pixar's own formula of observing life from a different perspective, this time exploring the world of video game characters.<br/><br/>The story of Wreck-It Ralph follows its eponymous character, an arcade game villain who is tired of playing the bad guy over the years & dreams of becoming a hero. Things are set in motion when he sneaks into a different game to win a medal of heroism but inadvertently unleashes a serious threat that could affect the entire arcade and ultimately crash-lands into another game where he meets a young ""glitch"" who makes him realise what it is to be a hero.<br/><br/>Directed by Rich Moore, Wreck-It Ralph begins really well and brims with a big splash of nostalgia for grown-ups & an inviting enough world for rug rats. Many notable characters from classic video games make their brief appearances plus it also incorporates their unique characteristics into the narrative. However, the second half of the story fails to live up to its brilliant first half and suffers from an overdose of sweetness that nearly ruins the whole picture.<br/><br/>There are still a whole lot of positives for the arcade games it puts on screen are refreshing to look at, the script is sharply witted although there are some moments when it feels a bit too forced, the animation is top-notch for the images vary from 8-bit arcade games quality to modern console HD graphics yet there isn't any friction between the two distinct visuals for its integration is seamless. And the character of Ralph is quite relatable, features a surprising depth & a well-defined arc.<br/><br/>Where the movie loses a few points is in the storyline set in the candy-coated cart racing game as that sugary sweet world & the characters it inhabits become annoying real soon. The vibrant, vivid colour palette, the kiddish humour & juvenile figures is more appealing to the younger audience. It does help in further developing Ralph's character arc but the sweetness is a tad too much to bear at times. The voice actors do a good job in their given roles, with John C. Reilly being the standout choice.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Wreck-It Ralph has something in store for viewers of all ages, is a wonderfully animated tale that's full of colours, joy & nostalgia, effectively delivers on the entertainment scale, and sensibly covers the themes of responsibility, identity & isolation. Smartly balancing the retro & new school vibe and featuring a tale that's approachable, accessible & amusing, Wreck-It Ralph is a definite surprise from Disney and would've left an even bigger impression if it hadn't gotten a bit carried away. Nevertheless, absolutely worth a shot."

","Wreck-It Ralph (2012) Dir: Rich Moore / Voice: John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch, Alan Tudyk: A love letter to video games. This one regards a change of thinking as Wreck-It Ralph desires to be a hero as oppose to the villain. He is part of an arcade game where he wrecks apartment buildings with his huge hands while hero Fix-It Felix repairs damages with his magic hammer. Ralph grows tired to being tossed in the mud and living in a dump so he sets out to earn a medal by entering another game called Hero's Duty. With Ralph gone his game is threatened to be terminated so Fix-It Felix sets out to find Ralph. This leads to a colorful arcade world called Sugar Rush where Ralph meets the tiny heroine named Vanellope who desires to win a race. Her issue is that she is a glitch and must win the race in order to repair the glitch. The colors are explosive and inventive with witty in jokes that are a delight to the eye. John C. Reilly voices Ralph whose desire is to matter. This whole idea of it being okay to be bad is not exactly the best message for young children but the focus will be on the colorful candy wonderland that leaves us in awe. Sarah Silverman steals the film as the youthful Vanellope with her energy and hilarious comebacks. Jack McBrayer voices the love struck Felix whose affection for the Hero's Duty heroine, voiced by Jane Lynch must penetrate her traumatic past. Alan Tudyk voices the villain King Candy whose secret runs deeper. Children will love the images while adults will reflect on those video games that impacted our imagination. Score: 9 / 10"

Or even, he should've been included with the main cast, he would be an awesome partner regardless his sarcasm!

","I put aside playing video games a number of years ago, but all the same I sat down to watch ""Wreck-It Ralph"" with a smile on my face, because I was anticipating nostalgia from seeing references to video games I used to play. As it turned out, a feeling of nostalgia did go through me a number of times, but there were other good things about the movie. The animation is excellent, and there aren't any dull spots anywhere in the story.<br/><br/>However, all the same I did feel that the script should have been worked on some more before the animators started to bring the story to life. The premise doesn't feel totally original - sharp viewers will recognize elements from other family movies ranging from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" to ""Toy Story"". Another problem is that there are some noticeable gaps in the story, where linking footage seems missing. (This may be because the movie as it is runs over 100 minutes, quite long for an animated movie. Maybe some cuts were made during production.) The biggest problem with the movie, however, is that except for the characters of Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope, there is not one likable character in the movie. At least, when it comes to likable characters that are given some depth and personality.<br/><br/>I suspect that these problems won't bother (younger) kids in the audience, who will probably gobble this movie up. As for older kids and adults, while they may see the same problems as I did, they will all the same find the movie okay. There are a lot worse family movies out there."

","Wreck it Ralph is a story about a bad guy in a video game who only wants to be the good guy for once. His challenge is laid out for him by his fellow game members, who tell him that if he wins a medal, he can live in the penthouse with them. This causes him to ""Go Turbo"" (Meaning that he leaves his game to participate in another, therefore disrupting the intended way of doing things) to be the good guy for once. However, Sonic the hedgehog clearly states at game central (the Power adaptor where all the games are plugged in) If you leave your game, and die in another, you don't respawn.<br/><br/>The premise of Wreck-it Ralph is appealing to everyone. Most of the people in the 20-30 year old demographic will have a good time here, as they'll notice all the little references and memes the movie has to offer, from King Candy entering the Konami Code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start) to get into his video game's coding, to the graffiti reading ""Aerith lives"" on a wall. I was also pleased that Disney acquired the rights to real video game characters and not just parodies. It was kind of nice to see Bowser and Dr. Robotnik (To me, he's Robotnik, not Eggman) in the same room.<br/><br/>Ralph, Felix, and Calhoun all made great characters. Ralph and Felix made a great parody of Donkey Kong and Mario while Calhoun was a great parody of someone like Samus Aran. They all fit well together. However...<br/><br/>The biggest negative was Vanellope. I thought she was purely annoying and I wanted her to shut up just as much as Ralph did. I understand she's not meant to appeal to me, but at least give her something funny to say rather than annoy the heck out of me.<br/><br/>One Final Note, Being an Animaniacs guy, I was pretty happy to see that Jess Harnell and Maurice LaMarche had roles in this movie, albeit very short ones. However, I think Harnell had one or two lines and LaMarche was Tapper. Kind of sad to see such talent go to waste.<br/><br/>Overall, This movie's worth a view. I'd be interested in a Sequel, and chances are there will be one, maybe 10 years in the future."
"Pedro_H","8","0","1","4 March 2014"," Cobbled-together clich√©-following script, but very entertaining nevertheless.
","Wreck-It Ralph is a video game bad guy (clearly modelled on Donkey Kong) who detests his life as a much-hated dump-living loner and longs to be, instead, a hero who saves the day and is loved-by-all. Better still have a shiny medal to hang around his neck. With this in mind he leaves his own game and seeks a medal in the other games in the arcade.<br/><br/>(Naturally by doing so he puts the ""whole of video arcade in danger."")<br/><br/>The internal logic of this cartoon doesn't really stand much scrutiny because video game characters don't have a life outside of their games and even if they did this is contradictory in the extreme. I suppose we have to suspend all our facilities as regards belief and logic, but why would a bad guy (created for the purposes of this alone) have a heart-of-gold? While this may be unimportant the film can't even decide on its own internal logic. Why would the characters die if the plug is pulled? Do they die if they have a power cut as well? Equally why didn't they die before they got to the arcade? <br/><br/>(This is a movie written by people who don't know their ROM from their RAM?) <br/><br/>For those old enough to remember eight-bit games and the early days of computing there are plenty of laughs and references. Q-bert was my favourite. Not a fan of shoot-em-ups generally and they play on screen worse than they do in any actual game. They just don't create any sense of danger. They are simply there to be shot and never seem to do anything to avoid being shot. They are about as menacing as wasps around a picnic.<br/><br/>For my money it would have been more fun for Ralph to go in to loads of different games and interact with loads of our old favourites. Here he only lingers in two. Clearly this would have cost a lot more and, who knows, meant having to pay licensing. From the information about the film available here this was one of the original ideas.<br/><br/>Ralph is quite a complex character in being a bit stupid (for laughs) one minute and quite cunning (for convenience) the next. I guess that a lot of dim characters are like this in movies, they have to serve the general plot and be whatever is needed. Worse the central character is such a bland retread of Shrek. John C. Reilly's voice performance is simply great though.<br/><br/>The King Candy (Alan Tudyk) character seems to be indicating he is gay (lots of pink - sorry salmon - in the castle) and speaks with a bit of a camp lisp. While attacking some prejudices (the girl racers are all bitches ripe to be made good) it endorses others? He is a lot of fun though and adds a tiny bit of danger to a plot where nothing-bad-can-happen-and-we-all-know-it.<br/><br/>Too cute and sharp tongued by-half Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) is a would-be racer who Ralph helps and is the co-central plot thread of the movie and while fun and entertaining, what follows is like watching somebody else's video game from over their shoulder.<br/><br/>I guess the end message is go and see this film, enjoy it and think about the character references (if you know them), but don't start thinking about it too much. It really falls apart if you do. Strangely for a film about growth and change, the payoff is actually pretty weak. Like many cartoons and animated series the central message seems to be that everybody should know their place and be happy with it. Another clich√© box ticked, sadly."

","Did you ever wonder that maybe deep within the code of your video games that the actual world of the characters might really exist in some sort of Matrix-like universe? What if the personality coded into them gave them life? That's the premise of Wreck-It Ralph, a sort-of Who Framed Roger Rabbit for the video game generation.<br/><br/>In a busy arcade filled with classics such as Pac-Man and Q-Bert (out of order) to modern kart racers such as (the fictitious) Sugar Rush, a humble Rampage clone called Fix-It Felix is nearing its 30th anniversary. During the night, when the arcade is closed, the characters from all the games come together in a hub located inside the power supply. Wreck-It Ralph, the antagonist of Fix-It Felix is feeling lonely and depressed at being treated like the bad guy outside of play-time and resents never being invited to parties. Tired of this alienation he takes off on a quest to gain trust, respect, and adoration by becoming a hero.<br/><br/>True to his name, he just causes disaster, but soon meets another outcast in the glitchy form of Vanellope von Shweetz, a deleted character locked away in the code of Sugar Rush. They bond, and work together, and in this middle act the film sags, lurching dangerously close to Shrek territory, substitutes the video game culture the fans have been enjoying for candy-based puns, which feel like they belong in a different movie, and recycles the ancient ""be yourself"" moral that Disney has been milking for many decades. Vanellope is ultimately likable, but her appearance and personality is torn straight from the Pixar Book of Universal Character Clich√©s and Child Brats (the movie is actually a Disney production, but the comment still stands).<br/><br/>Thankfully, the movie recovers and kicks into high gear for the final act. Ralph accepts his role as a villain within his video game and secures his status as a hero to the audience, up there with Baloo and the Beast. He IS similar to Shrek, but superior, and his is a superior movie.<br/><br/>Video game fans will love the diverse range of characters featured here (Kano, Sonic, Zangeif - among many others) while all viewers will adore the beautiful color pallet and Henry Jackman's fun score. There's a lot of imagination here and, middle act aside, Disney have created a lot of potential for a very wide universe and franchise. I eagerly await Wreck-It Ralph 2."

","Disney sets a high bar though. The movie was good and entertaining but still, it was kind of forgettable. It had the usual Disney theme of ""love yourself, appreciate yourself for who you are, you don't need to be something you're not"", which seemed very familiar since I just saw ""Monsters U"" the other day. But when they pound on those poignant themes it always brings a tear to my eye. The movie has masterful use of classic storytelling and archetypes, as is expected from Disney. Gorgeous animation and CGI, from Disney it practically goes without saying.<br/><br/>I have to complain though: Why did they pick Sarah Silverman of all actors, to do the voice of a cute little girl? When I heard the voice I immediately could tell it was her because it sounded so obnoxious and out-of-place. The voice of Ralph wasn't that great either, it reminded me of Barney Gumble.<br/><br/>The movie starts out interesting, then has a boring lull in the middle, but then the ending it gets exciting again."
"Stompgal_87","8","0","1","10 January 2014"," The best computer game-themed animated film since 'Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase', although not Disney's finest
","I have wanted to see this film for ages since I like computer games although I do not play them now as much as I did when I was younger. 'Wreck-It Ralph' has a great mixture of characters, fantastic backgrounds, a varied blend of animation styles and a diverse range of music but I found the story confusing in places.<br/><br/>While the most prominent animation style is 3D computer-generated, I like the old 2D computer game-style animation whether it was used for the stylised Walt Disney Animation Studios 'Steamboat Willie' logo (the best incarnation since the one used before 'Tangled' to commemorate it as Disney's 50th animated classic feature-length film) accompanied with a vintage video game-style arrangement of Mickey's whistling or used for the Fix-It Felix Jr. arcade game segments. The 3D replica of the world of Fix-It Felix Jr. had some jerky animation on the characters but I guess it was done intentionally to reflect the jerky animation in the original game. Nevertheless the majority of the 3D animation was superb and matched the same standard one would expect in a Pixar film. The backgrounds were imaginative, in particular the inner workings of the arcade machines, their power supply and the sweet pastel-coloured world of Sugar Rush (what a great name for a candy-themed racing game). The latter environment had some clever and witty elements such as Nesquick sand, laughing Laffy Taffy that hung above it, the Diet Coke swamp and the Mentos falling into it, thus putting a new spin on the now-slightly outdated soda-and-Mentos-fountain trend.<br/><br/>The best characters in this film are Wreck-It Ralph (albeit having blocky arms and legs yet a more rounded head and body), Fix-It Felix, Calhoun (one of the most realistically-designed characters in the film), Q-Bert (who I remember from an updated version of the game for Sony PlayStation) and Vanellope (sounds like a cross between Vanessa and Penelope) Von Schweetz, who reminded me appearance and personality-wise of Agnes from 'Despicable Me'. John C. Reilly was impeccable as Ralph, Jane Lynch really brought her Sue Sylvester (the harsh cheerleading coach in 'Glee') side to Calhoun; and Q-Bert was amusing with his gobbledygook style of speech with his speech bubbles similar to those used to suggest profanities (which there is little to none of in this film); however I was uncertain about Sarah Silverman's voice for Vanellope to begin with since she made her sound like a cross between a cutesy little girl and a teenager but Vanellope became more likable as the film progressed.<br/><br/>The story is mostly original but there are parts of it that were derivative, such as the main character being a villain (a la 'Despicable Me' and 'Megamind') albeit its references to video games that were fun to spot (including Dr Eggman and Sonic the Hedgehog, Q-Bert, Pac-Man and King Koopa/Bowser from the Super Mario games), and complicated, especially in the middle but I liked its dramatic twists such as Ralph destroying Vanellope's new car but Felix fixing it and that during the car race as well as the idea of Ralph and other computer game villains attending an Alcoholics Anonymous-type group and the arcade characters coming to life at closing time in a similar manner to the toys coming to life in the absence of humans in the 'Toy Story' franchise.<br/><br/>Although a lot of today's music is not as diverse as it used to be, I found this film's soundtrack very diverse indeed. It consists of electronic old computer game-style music (I liked this style applied to 'Oh, Susanna!'), more-familiar chart hits (Kool and the Gang's 'Celebration' and Rihanna's 'Shut Up and Drive' that played along their corresponding scenes very well) and some lesser-known numbers such as 'Sugar Rush (reminded me of those quirky Japanese pop songs you'd hear in a Cybercandy store)' and Owl City's 'When Will I See You Again?' that played during the end credits. I did, however, find parts of the soundtrack generic since they sounded similar to other musical scores for films of a similar genre and I wasn't too keen on the piece of instrumental modern dance music played during an earlier arcade scene because I usually only like dance music if it has added vocals.<br/><br/>Overall 'Wreck-It Ralph' did not meet all of my expectations but it ran at a reasonable length, paid homage to video games in a unique way and above all was the best computer game-themed animated film since 'Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase.' 8/10."
"badoli","7","0","1","7 December 2013"," It's a good movie.
","Some friends saw it and told me it's too Disney-esque. Now that i saw it i would say that's not really the issue here. True, from a gamer point of view it falls a little short on paying tribute to the idea. After the first half hour the video game references are used up, which was a little disappointing. But from a movie point of view it's definitely one of the better animation movies i've seen.<br/><br/>This is mostly due to the clever script. It tells the story of two outsiders unwillingly joining forces to archive their dream of being accepted for what they are, each in their own respect. For a recent Disney movie it deals with quite some serious topics like loneliness, peer pressure and social exclusion. And it handles those as respectful as possible in the sugar-sweet environment it takes place.<br/><br/>Finally the mandatory happy end kept on the saner side of kitsch, which is already a lot to ask nowadays. So yea, this movie is definitely worth a watch."

","This film is fantastic! I was sadly disappointed the academy did not share my opinion as it being the best animated film of 2012. Its got it all: excellent story, great VO talent, superb animation, focused pacing, sound design, music ( no Randy Newman, thank you very much!). Even as an adult I was surprised at the plot twist at the end. The characters are all likable and accessible. It sort of compares to Pixar's Toy Story in one key way and that is instead of actual toys being self-aware of their role in human life, its digitized characters who reside in arcade games. The film builds to a great climax at the end, but never leaves you wanting anything more during the adventure. I have only one complaint and its THE only reason I don't give it ten stars, and that is I wish it had showcased more familiar arcade-game characters. I used to play a lot of those games and it was great seeing this application of retro/vintage characters represented however it would have been cool to see references of the more popular games of that era, which sadly are not at all. I cant help but feel this was intentional as Disney has unlimited resources to license such things. The connection to familiar game/characters would have only made the film that much stronger. But that aside, Wreck-it Ralph is a slick, smart animated masterpiece on par with anything else that has ever been released."

","Wreck-It Ralph is a wonderful nostalgic treat. I'm not a gamer whatsoever and I gave up on them before the war games became popular but I have to admit I still play the occasional arcade game. Regardless, I loved the way they fit the format of a video game into raising the film's stakes. As a script it's really great, with fantastic puns, cute pair-ups and a thoroughly thought out world. However, as cute as it is, it does feel like it was taking this world and applying the formula. I don't know what it is about animation and their scripts, yes they're the most imaginative but they're also the least brave. It's great to have a tight script that's beat- by-beat on the money, especially if the twists are genuinely surprising and there's affection for the characters but I think it's more in the rigid structure of the scripts rather than the moments themselves. It lacks a certain elegance that makes it potentially inspiring, even if it has great use of escalation, a huge climax and a sweet epilogue. However, I hope this current generation treasures this film as I can imagine it'll forever have that effect on them as Pixar's earliest does for me. I do already want to see it again and I hope it grows on me. It's the type of film that uses a lot of iconography and hopes to establish some of its own. We'll see if it does, that'll take time.<br/><br/>edit: And after a rewatch, my appreciation and enjoyment of the film just grows. Previous complaints proved wrong.<br/><br/>8/10"

","With some unabashed nostalgic throwback into the glory days of arcades, writer-director brings Rich Moore brings one of the most charming, if somewhat generic, animated movies in a while. The movie focuses on video game villain Wreck-It-Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) - referencing the Donkey Kong barrel throwing gorilla - is tired of being the odd man out in his world, constantly thrown off the top of the building by the hero Fix It Felix (Jack McBrayer) and the apartment house inhabitants. Forced into solitude, living in a dump on the outskirts of the video-game, Ralph hopes for a change in fortunes, aspiring to become a liked and cherished character. In search of glory he decides to jump game into a first player shooter ""Hero's Duty"". A sequence of events however has him crash land in the kart racing world of ""Sugar Rush"", where he meets Vannellope (Sarah Silverman), an apparent glitch computer character, whose sarcastic wisecracks seem at odds with the sugar-coated wonderland in which she lives. Here Ralph finds a close affinity to the outcast girl and attempts his best to aide her in winning the go-kart race. Here however they must first overcome the flamboyant mad-hatter King Candy (Alan Tudyk), the kooky leader of this game world. Meanwhile the goodie-two-shoes Felix ventures out of his game in order to bring back their sole villain, soon finding aide in ""Hero's Duty"" commander Calhoun (Jane Lynch).<br/><br/>Albeit not a classic, ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" has enough wit, humour and magic to make it a fun re-watchable dash into the past of arcade games glory days, together with guest appearances by Pac-Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Q*Bert or Dowser. The overall concept of computer characters lounging out of their computer game worlds after the arcade closes, much like toys coming to life when the child is outside of its room, brings about some novel ideas, like a support group for villains struggling to accept their endless role as a baddie. Possibly the most intriguing is the use of animation, where each game has its own specificity with rigid, jumpy animation in the outdated Fix-It-Felix to the ultra-realistic realm of the ""Call of Duty"" rip-off. Most of the movie takes place in the ultra-colourful candy-land realm of the go-kart racing, gloriously over-the-top, ultra-sweetened, but with characters contradicting the external niceness of the game (instead full of vindictive, insensitive racers and its conniving king).<br/><br/>Through this internally contradictory exposition come most of the enjoyment the movie has to offer, even though the general plot heads into strikingly predictable territories once the initial premise becomes clear. Therefore, ""Wreck It Ralph"" becomes a bit of a hostage to the clich√©s it incorporates (story-wise as well as character-wise, as referencing is the name of this game), placing its strengths strongly on the shoulders of the dedicated worlds, computer game homages and several well drafted subversive characters (with Vannellope the stand-out). The satire brought about by endless clich√©s and references does wear thin making the inside jokes tiresome and entirely predictable at length, but thankfully that is not the only thing going for the movie and the nostalgic qualities will definitely hit home with most seasoned gamers.<br/><br/>Of note, there are several moments of on-screen brutality, which may make parents uncomfortably squirm, while corner-checking out the reaction of their kids, as well as a few cumbersome inadequate jokes not suited for the target audience."
"kematian81","9","0","1","13 June 2013"," Review Singkat
","WRECK-IT RALPH is Disney's latest animated movie about the world of arcade game characters. It's a delightful, morally uplifting family movie. <br/><br/>Litwak's Family Fun Center is full of arcade games for all ages to enjoy; but, when the lights go off and the doors close, the characters inside the arcade games live a life of their own. The characters are made of programmed code and can travel between different arcade games through what they call Game Central Station, which in reality is the power strip into which the games are plugged. We are introduced to Ralph, a character in the 8-Bit arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr. <br/><br/>Ralph is a big man in the world of arcade games. Nine feet tall and 600 pounds, he's a formidable force. His job is to wreck the apartment building of the locals who are called ""Nicelanders."" As he wrecks the building, Fix-It Felix, Jr. comes in to fix the building. If Felix fixes the building without getting hit by the bricks that Ralph throws at him, he (and the game player) wins, and the Nicelanders then proceed to throw Ralph off the building and into the mud. The Nicelanders then celebrate with Felix and award him a medal as Ralph goes to live in a pile of bricks. This is Ralph's job. After all, he's the bad guy in the Fix-It Felix Jr game. <br/><br/>Because of his destructive nature and his social inept-ability, the people of Niceland ostracize Ralph even when the game isn't being played. Ralph even attends a Bad Guys ""Anonymous"" group where one member tells Ralph that just because he's a ""Bad Guy"" doesn't mean that he's a bad guy. However, Ralph is tired of being the one that is never appreciated and always has to lose. Ralph says he would like to earn a medal for once, but he's told that ""Bad Guys"" can't win medals. Finally fed up, Ralph angrily tells Felix and the Nicelanders he's going to go get a shiny medal and that when he does, they will have to accept him. <br/><br/>Ralph leaves the world of Niceland to find a game where he can find a shiny medal to award himself. As he travels between different games, he meets a young girl named Vanellope who's even more alone than Ralph is. Through Venellope, Ralph learns an important lesson of helping others instead of himself. <br/><br/>WRECK-IT RALPH is highly entertaining. The story is genuinely fun and moving. Also, characters are each unique with their own little quirks and personalities. Children will enjoy the great animation and adults will love the jokes about the games from the 1980s and 90s. Best of all, WRECK-IT RALPH has a strong moral world view of loving your neighbor as yourself, literally ""your neighbor"" in Ralph's case. The movie appears to have a Christian, redemptive definition of loving your neighbor and being a true friend. <br/><br/>WRECK-IT RALPH does have a slight ambiguity. Ralph is programmed to be the ""Bad Guy"" in the arcade game and, according to the movie, that's not bad. Even so, in the end, even though Ralph is still the ""Bad Guy"" in the game, the people around him choose to accept him because he chose to act selflessly. Thus, younger children could be confused about Ralph in the end being a ""Good Bad Guy."" There's also some light action violence and some scatological humor in WRECK-IT RALPH, so caution is advised."

","I saw a review for this film on TV and I was definitely up for seeing a Disney computer animated movie (without Pixar), I do like video games and have fond memories of the classic ones, so I was interested to see which ones would be incorporated into this film. Basically Litwak's Arcade is full of video games, and when it closes at night the various characters within them travel through the cables into the game platform and can travel to the other games, when doing this though they cannot regenerate in a game that it not their own. Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) is the bad guy of video game Fix-It Felix, the game consists of him wrecking buildings filled with residents while Fix-It Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer) tries to fix the damage, but Ralph is tired of being the villain, and he is shunned by the other game characters. His game is celebrating its 30th anniversary, he is not invited by the Nicelanders to the celebrations, and he unintentionally spoils the party seeming aggressive. In the game Tapper he gets the idea to be accepted by his fellow characters by winning a gold medal, so he enters first-person shooter game Hero's Duty, but entering with no-nonsense leader Sergeant Calhoun (Glee's Jane Lynch) he unintentionally interferes with the player's experience, but he gets the chance to climb the alien tower of the game and reach the medal to be won, which he does. Using an escape pod he flies out of the game, not realising that he has taken a Cy-Bug with him, the alien enemy of Hero's Duty whose only instinct is to multiply, eat and take over, and with Ralph out of his game it is reported to the arcade manager, and he sticks on the Out of Order sign, meaning it may be unplugged. Trying to land Ralph unintentionally flies and crashes into kart racing game Sugar Rush, a sugary land full of candy and chocolate, and he loses his medal while flying, trying to retrieve it he meets glitch character Vanellope Von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), who steals it from him, using it as a token to enter the race of the game. Despite her paying her way into the race King Candy (A Knight's Tale's Alan Tudyk) and the competitors do not want her to participate because they think a game playing will mistake a glitch as a technical fault which would cause the game to be unplugged, but Ralph defends her and they make a deal so that she can race and he can get his medal back. Meanwhile back in Hero's Duty Calhoun meets Felix who is looking for the villain of his game, they find out he is somewhere in Sugar Rush along with a Cy-Bug, the gun wielding leader wants them dead not just because they will take over, but because she has a back story where her fianc√© was killed by one of the aliens when she was to be married. In her secret home in Diet Cola Mountain, beneath the mound of Mentos rocks falling and causing explosions in the liquid, Ralph and Vanellope have brought the kart that they built together in the factory earlier, the wrecks a race track for her to practise on, and he is confident that she is a great racer that has the potential to win, and she is willing to do so. King Candy has hacked into the computer system of the game and managed to retrieve the gold medal that Ralph took, he tries to convince Ralph that he can take it if he assures that his young friend will not race, explaining the glitch problem could mean the game being shut down, he is sad to do it, but he does what he feels is right in telling her this, but she thinks he only cares about his medal. Returning to Fix-It Felix he sees that all the characters have abandoned the game, because they believe it will be shut down the next morning due to his absence mistaken for a fault, and looking out into the arcade he sees Sugar Rush, but he notices on the side a picture of Vanellope on the cabinet, so he realises she is meant to be part of the game. Ralph returns to the sugary game, and he saves Felix and Calhoun who were being held in the prison by the King, the handyman character fixes the wrecked kart for his friend to race in, but when it commences the Cy-Bug eggs hatch and the alien creatures take over, and then it turns out King Candy is actually Turbo, a character from a racing game that got filled with competitiveness and caused a rival game to be shut down. After a big battle between the alien bugs and the disguised real villain Ralph races to Diet Cola Mountain to release the mound of Mentos and create a beacon to kill all the creatures, including Turbo who is one himself, Vanellope saves her friend from being killed, and she is able to cross the race finish line to become a real character and no longer glitch, and in the end Calhoun married Felix, and Ralph is accepted as a nice guy by everyone. Also starring Adam Carolla as Wynnchel, Futurama's John DiMaggio as Beard Papa, Kevin Deters as Clyde and Roger Craig Smith as Sonic the Hedgehog, with additional voices by Jim Cummings and Elizabeth Daily. Reilly is a great choice for the cuddly voice of the shunned big bodied but big-hearted character, and Silverman is funny as the slightly annoying young girl insistent on racing, the special effects to create the familiar and new characters is fantastic, the script and jokes based on video games are clever to be enjoyed by adults and children watching, it is just a fun animated adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Good!"
"ShootingShark","6","0","3","13 February 2013"," Charming Animated Fable Of Video game Bad Guy Seeking Redemption
","Wreck-It Ralph is the villain in an old video game who is fed up with constantly being defeated and excluded. Hoping to win the admiration of his fellow game characters, he vows to win himself a medal and leaves his home in search of adventure.<br/><br/>This clever, imaginative, touching and nutty little drama is a great Disney picture with a terrific storyline, rich visuals and excellent characters. It's a tad reminiscent of Toy Story or The Incredibles in that it's about a cartoon guy struggling with his own identity, but the videogaming context and the wealth of interesting environments make it highly original, contrasting Ralph's own game (Fix-It Felix Jr, a platformer in the vein of Donkey Kong), with the action-packed Hero's Duty (a first-person shooter not unlike Halo), the cutesy Sugar Rush (a glitzy racer reminiscent of Super Mario Kart), the Game Central Station hangout where the characters go to relax and even the real-world arcade where the kids come to play. The movie weaves in and out of these places and they all have a great look and feel to them, but it's the characters themselves which really grab your attention. Ralph is a very unconventional Disney movie lead, and all the richer for it as he struggles to find a balance between self-centred brute and a man on a quest for dignity and respect, whilst Vanellope's lovably smart-mouthed and self-confident exterior gradually dissolves to reveal the vulnerable girl within. Reilly and Silverman's vocal performances contrast fantastically well and the support cast and characters are great too. Video game fans (like me) have much to enjoy, both in the lovely styling of the animation (I love the flickering eight-bit Felix sprites) and the plethora of cameos by characters from thirty years' worth of famous games, but as is so often the case with movies made for children it's the quality of the story and the depth with which you identify with the people which make it such a winner. Packed full of funny scenes, crazy action, eye-popping moments, tender drama and winning characters, this is great family fare."

The once fired employee of Disney in the early eighties who wanted to use computers to create animation was hired by a small time movie maker whom you might have heard of...George Lucas. John then with a special group of people created PIXAR with the help of super geek Steve Jobs, creator of Apple Computers. Now Jobs who is on the board of directors of Disney and Lassiter and friends in charge of Disney studios can create movies like Tangled and this wonderful movie.<br/><br/>Ralph is a great movie for all ages and centered on what is important...The story."

","Have you ever felt like you were stuck in a role you never wanted to play? Constantly subjected to scorn and ridicule simply for performing the only task available to you? What if you could change that?<br/><br/>Fix-it Felix Jr. has been a popular game in Litvak's for years. The hero and titular character, Felix (voiced by Jack McBrayer) has a magic hammer that can repair any damage done by the game's villain, Ralph. When the game is over, Felix is given a medal while Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is tossed off the roof by the tenants of the building he failed to destroy. When the arcade closes and the game is turned off, Ralph returns to his home atop a garbage heap in the nearby dump. For recreation, he visits Tapper's, a vintage game that assigns the player the role of a bartender. Also, upon our introduction to the story, Ralph makes his first visit to a support group for video game villains. Among the villains in attendance at Bad-Anon, we see M. Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter (voiced by Gerald C. Rivers and director Rich Moore respectively), a ghost from Pac-Man (voiced by Kevin Deters), and a zombie (Raymond Persi). During that meeting, he announces he no longer wants to be a bad guy. With the 30th anniversary of Fix-it Felix Jr., the tenants throw a party and ""forget"" to invite Ralph. Ralph crashes the party, in every sense of the word, and leaves soon after. Before he's left, he vows to return with a medal, something denied him by Felix and the tenants of the building he destroys. He seizes the opportunity to travel to a new game, a first-person shooter game called Hero's Duty, when a character from that game passes out in the bathroom. While at the center of Hero's Duty, Ralph is overwhelmed by the violence in modern games and refuses to heed the orders of his superior, Sergeant Calhoun (voiced by Jane Lynch). Once the arcade closes and the game ends, Ralph decides to forgo the usual hurdles of Hero's Duty and steal the medal typically awarded to the winner. After stealing the medal and, unwittingly, bringing a menacing enemy insect known as a Cy-bug with him, Ralph heads to the kart-racing game Sugar Rush. It's there that he encounters the perpetually glitchy and terminally annoying Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman). Despite the initial friction, Ralph and Vanellope (Silverman) bond over their shared status as outcasts.<br/><br/>There is, of course, more to the story including Felix's pursuit of Ralph into the various other games and his budding romance with the no-nonsense Sergeant Calhoun, the true origin of Silverman's character, and an eventual revolt in the world of Sugar Rush. All of it, and I do mean all of it, had me riveted. I will say that, as a fan of old-style video games, I would've preferred seeing the character of Ralph travel to more than just the two different games besides his. Regardless of my criticisms, Wreck-It Ralph is hilariously entertaining and fun for viewers of all ages. Check it out."

","It takes a while for a video game to be considered ""retro"". For a while, games that feature jumping plumbers, flashing ghosts, and super fast hedgehogs were just considered old and stupid. I think there is a certain amount of time that has to pass before a game reaches retro status. It has to withstand the test of time before they become charming again. Before they are remembered fondly, instead of just being remembered. Wreck-It Ralph does for video games what Toy Story did for action figures. It remembers them fondly and brings them back to life in brilliant computer animation and talented voice work. Much like the way that Tom Hanks was the center piece for Toy Story, John C. Reilly is the mainstay for Wreck-It Ralph, however, he is hardly what makes this movie great. The supporting cast of voice talent, including the saccharin and overly adorable part of Vanellope played by Sarah Silverman, and the comedic genius combination of Fix It Felix, played by Jack Mcbrayer and the strong and hilariously tragic heroin of Calhoun, mastered by Jane Lynch. These two together steal the movie. The story is classic. A misunderstood giant who people cower from based solely on looks and is doomed to be alone forever because of the hand that life has dealt them (ahem, Shrek). Ralph takes it upon himself to try and change his fate so he ventures out of his own game through a very imaginative subway system that connects all of the different games in the arcade. In his travels, he enters into a first player shooter game where he feels alive for the first time in thirty years. On a freak occurrence, he enters into the game ""Sugar Rush"" which is like a diabetic cross between Mario Kart and Willy Wonka's factory. This is where the adventure truly begins. Wreck-It Ralph is colorfully gorgeous in every scene. The story makers work in classic video game characters at just the right amounts, which will appeal to parents taking their kids to see it. A hologram Sonic the Hedgehog, an elegant well spoken Pac-Man ghost, and a homeless Q-Bert are all good for reminiscent laughs that your kids won't understand. This movie will make you want to dust off your old game system and fall in love with your pixilated buddies all over again. Also, it's a shoe-in for best animated feature come Oscar time.<br/><br/>Bottom Line:<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph delivers for audiences of all ages. It brings humor, action, and subtle doses of heart throughout. Which way to the closest arcade? briancudemo.blogspot.com"
"KineticSeoul","9","0","3","20 November 2012"," Probably the best CGI animated movie of 2012
","This movie is a blast from start to finish and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. When I first saw the trailer showing a CGI movie blending video game characters within video games. I thought it was a cool idea and thought it was going to be a good entertaining flick. But this turned out to be a great entertaining flick. Some reviewers compare this movie to the ""Toy Story"" franchise. I can see the connection but this has enough of it's own elements to stand on it's own without it going in a really gimmicky direction. There is also a bit of emotion and heart to this movie and doesn't seem forced in. The protagonists are all likable in there own way and I couldn't help but care for all the main characters in this movie. Overall this is probably my favorite CGI animated movie of 2012. And can't wait for the sequel.<br/><br/>9/10"
"RainDogJr","7","0","1","17 November 2012"," Fun! Friends! And Fix it Felix Jr. featuring Wreck-it Ralph
","In my recent IMDb commentary for HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA I mentioned Disney's new film WRECK-IT RALPH. This is what I wrote about it: ""one of the trailers I got to watch was the one of the upcoming Disney film WRECK-IT RALPH; it seems that ""Ralph"" will not miss the chance to deliver really clever material out of a mash-up of classic characters (video games characters, like Nintendo's Bowser, in that case)"". <br/><br/>Now that I have finally seen it I can say that this is a film with a very nicely constructed alternate universe where video game characters are much more than a bunch of pixels. I mean, ""Ralph"" does features a whole lot of classic video game characters ‚Äì in fact, it's one of those things, like the IMAGINATIONLAND trilogy of SOUTH PARK, that you have to watch frame by frame to identify all the famous characters in it. There's Pac-Man, Sonic and the STREET FIGHTER characters. <br/><br/>Anyone who grew up in the eighties will be especially thrilled to see those characters, although they are only extras or, in some cases, just part of the background. This goes for that creation of an alternate universe; and it's a real success, with really clever and fun ideas. It's a TOY STORY sort of thing, just replace toys with video game characters and try to answer that same question of ""what would they do if they were anthropomorphic characters?"" If the toys have to work for the kids, the video game heroes and villains too ‚Äì here's there's a whole working system, like in MONSTERS, INC. <br/><br/>Yes, in ""Ralph"" we have clever ideas through and through, as if it was another gem from Pixar. For instance, we learn everything that happens when a game either breaks or goes out of fashion (it's pretty rough for the characters as you can tell); we have too stuff like a great reference to the differences between the games from the golden age of the arcade and the modern HD ones such as CALL OF DUTY and GEARS OF WAR. The premise itself is really nice: the villain of a game (Ralph ‚Äì voice of John C. Reilly) is simply tired of his daily job and wants to become the hero! <br/><br/>As a movie about video games, ""Ralph"" is definitely a blast. But as a whole, well, it's not something annoying and noisy like ""Transylvania"" but nevertheless it's an average, just-to- see-once, flick. It ain't a gem like, you know, almost every one from the catalog of Pixar. <br/><br/>*Watched it on 11 November, 2012"

","Wreck-It Ralph Disney is awesome 3/4 stars <br/><br/>After taking in quite a few animated films with my kids i would have to say this surprised me as i found the others duds and actually quite boring. Great original storyline that has all the bad guys from the 80's era games or 8-bit if you will meeting regularly to share the dark secrets are astonished when the bad guy and main character from The Wrekk-it Ralph game announces that he wants to be a good guy and for once be the one who gets the medal and stands on top of his famed apartment building with the tenants he saved, In Wreck-it Ralph, Ralph destroys the building whilst fix it Felix jumps up and down the building fixing all that Ralph has destroyed both antagonists racing to the top to save the tenants. Felix usually saves the day and stands proudly on top with the tenants as poor Ralph sits angrily at the bottom of the building in a puddle of mud.<br/><br/>Ralph has had enough of this and tells Felix during a 30th anniversary celebratory party that he is done 'wrecking' and is gonna find his medal so he can be the victor for once. this starts the film leading us into something i personally imagined as a teen gamer growing up in the 80's...what it would be like to be inside the game? Ralph jumps from game to game inside an arcade...going through the wires and digital circuitry. True to his name, Ralph wrecks everything and ends up unleashing a evil force onto the gaming world and has top team up with a young 'glitch' racecar driver named Vanellope who was outcast from her car racing game 'Sugar Rush' in order to win the race and defeat the evil so all is well in gaming land yet once again.<br/><br/>Actors lending their vocal talents to the film were John C. Reilly (Ralph), Sarah Silverman (Vanelope) Jane Lynch (Calhoun..who comes from a HD graphic FPS game and whose character was definitely drawn perfect for her) to name a few. Great CGI animation and kudos to Disney for providing a movie that the whole family can enjoy, even someone like me who doesn't really care for this genre of films. It was a very nice change then sitting bored out of mind for 1hr and 30mins."

","I'm as cynical as it gets when it comes to Disney, but even I have to give props when they do something right. And ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a winner. The father/daughter relationship between Ralph and Vanellope is sweet, endearing and a punch to the gut. John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman are ideal choices, but it's a pretty great cast from top to bottom. and despite the sticky sweetness of Sugar Rush, the ending doesn't come off schmaltzy.<br/><br/>That said, the opening setup is my favorite part. I do love the Pixar-like invention of the first half hour; seeing what happens behind the screen and traveling from one game to the next through the power cords. It's very ""TRON"". And I love the movie's sense of humor with Bad Anon. They could've been cheap with the video game references here, but they feel authentic and are genuinely funny. <br/><br/>This is good stuff.<br/><br/>7/10"
