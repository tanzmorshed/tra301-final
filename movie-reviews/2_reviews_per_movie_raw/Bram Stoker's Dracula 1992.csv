"Moonlyn","10","362","482","14 February 2005"," Oldman is the Best Dracula Ever!
","This is the best rendition of Dracula ever captured on film. Gary Oldman's dark and sensual personae outshines any other vampire who ever dare put on a cape. To me Gary Oldman is the most talented and underrated actor ever. He becomes who he is playing, however in this role... Dracula became him... Oldman set the bar so high it is untouchable even to Bela Lugosi. Winona Ryder's delicateness suited the role of Mina/Elisabeta nicely and Keanu Reeves played the unsuspecting and naive Jonathan with satisfaction. However the whole movie comes together because of Gary Oldman's intoxicating essence. He draws the viewers into his darkness and passion and guides them through until the end. This film is drastically romantic and hauntingly captivating- just like a real Dracula movie should be. The cinematography deserved Oldman's phenomenal performance and perfectly created a true vampire realm. Francis Ford Coppola is brilliant. This is the spirit of the vampire."
"MovieAddict2016","7","66","84","18 October 2005"," Visually striking, but Coppola's storytelling eccentricities are ill suited for the story itself
","""Apocalypse Now"" worked due to its hazy, surreal vision of a hellish world. Coppola returned thirteen years later and created a similarly haunting and poetic so-called ""masterpiece,"" a supposed truthful adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula tale - when, in fact, the truth is that this movie is no more faithful to Stoker than the (superior) Universal Pictures original.<br/><br/>The hazy film-making is visually satisfying, and some of the special effects are - simply put - amazing. Coppola's backlighting and use of shadows is creative and unique. But, unfortunately, after a while his emphasis on style over content begins to eat away at the film's other strengths - the relationship between the heroine (Winona Ryder) and Dracula (Gary Oldman) is weak. Many story links are completely nonsensical and people appear and disappear at whimsy. The heroine's fiancée (Keanu Reeves) writes to her from Transylvania, asking her to depart at once to marry him; in a matter of one or two scenes she has suddenly traveled a vast distance and is standing at the alter prepared to wed. It seems like Coppola loses a grip on his characters and plotting very early on.<br/><br/>Oldman gives a chilling performance but isn't given very much to do, because he's set aside and the special effects take over. The opening scenes of his battle and his motivation to become the King of the Undead is very enthralling - if Coppola had maintained this mixture of style and content the movie would have been far better.<br/><br/>The casting of the weak Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder in leading roles harms the impact of the film as well. Reeves sounds like a Californian pothead imitating a Brit; Ryder treats the material as if it is a dramatic, over-the-top theatre rendition; every line she speaks is sickeningly cheesy.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins turns in a disappointing performance as the utterly forgettable Van Helsing, who is given very little to do in this particular film apart from show up when convenient and sprout fancy little one-liners, most of them dramatic closers to scenes (e.g. ""We are dealing with a demon!"", then a cut-away to another scene.) Overall, ""Dracula"" is a good film and is worth seeing for its visuals alone. It is not, however, the strongest adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel; given the hype surrounding its release in 1992, the completed effort is rather lackluster in the story department."

","First of all, sorry for my English: I'm Italian and I don't know if I am able to express not in my language my thoughts with the proper terms. Anyway, I loved this movie, even if I agree that the title should have been F.F.Coppola's Dracula. In fact it is a very personal read of the original script. So, I can understand, but not agree, with all critics about important differences to Bram Stoker's masterpiece. It's a movie you can love or hate, there is no midway, as all comments prove. Personally, I loved the way Coppola reviewed the classic tale, giving Dracula a reason to be what he became after the loss of his wife e to search in England the reincarnation of his lost love. Gary Oldman is absolutely fantastic, lavish, romantic,chilling, in particular as he plays an old Dracula in the beginning of the movie. Definitely the best character of his career until now (let's see how he portrays Churchill in the Darkest Hour). Winona Ryder is so sweet and adorable that I forgive the fact she hasn't been the best choice to play Mina. The other actors (except for Keanu Reeves, completely outcast and unable to act) are all good choices. The music is wonderful, as cinematography, art/set direction, make up and costumes (who cares if Dracula wears John Lennon style sunglasses...). This Dracula is seductive as no other movies ever showed and as no other actor was able to portrait the dark prince. By the way, the choice of Keanu Reeves and some screenplay bad errors and holes don't allow to give a 10. But at the same time I can understand it's not a movie for all tastes. As I already written, you can love or hate it."

","Though I did not read the book and can't compare it to the movie, I found Bram Stoker's Dracula quiet excellent. The costume design, lighting, camera work, make-up-fx are all very good and make for a very atmospheric movie.<br/><br/>There are some truly outstanding things in this film.<br/><br/>1, the editing... excellent, I love the way they worked with dissolves, the hypnotic feel they created with the careful editing. Every frame flows in the other, the whole style grabs you and never lets you go... I simply could not turn my eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>2, the acting... Gary Oldman is THE Dracula, IMO. Seductive, strong, bad and scary in his own distinctive way, yet really romantic.<br/><br/>Hopkins is funny as Van Helsing and quiet ironic.<br/><br/>Winona is a great Mina. Beautiful, innocent. She looks great in these Victorian costumes.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is not as bad as many of you think. He makes the best of his underwritten character.<br/><br/>3, the Score... haunting, romantic, scary. It works beautiful with the pictures.<br/><br/>I think this movie is a great cinematic achievement and very underrated. It's a shame they don't make movies like that any more.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","113","159","13 August 2001"," Francis takes on Dracula and makes it into a masterpiece
","One of the best known and most popular Dracula films is by Francis Ford Coppola. At the time he really hadn't made a hit film since The Godfather, he was going bankrupt. So what better way to get out of debt than to make something that is pretty much a guaranteed thing that audiences will love? We got the scares for the boys and the romance for the girls and it equals Dracula. Many people ask me what is with the appeal of vampires? My opinion; it all equals sex. The dashing handsome man coming into the young lady's room at night confessing his desire for her and her giving herself completely to him is not only romantic, but dangerous and filled with adventure. I always found it funny that Dracula was supposed to be the villain of the story, but he's offering to take the girl on this incredible adventure through the world and time yet her usually bland boyfriend doesn't want it that way so he rips her from that experience I don't know, maybe I just look at things too differently. However moving onto the film, Francis took on the classic tale claiming to be ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", not really being 100% faithful to the novel and really over glamed it, however still made this into a very good movie.<br/><br/>In 1897, newly-qualified solicitor Jonathan Harker takes the Transylvanian Count Dracula as a client from his colleague R. M. Renfield, who has gone insane. Jonathan travels to Transylvania to arrange Dracula's real estate acquisition in London, including Carfax Abbey. Jonathan meets Dracula, who discovers a picture of Harker's fiancée, Mina, and believes that she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta, his long lost love. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be seduced by his brides and sails to England with boxes of his native soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey. In London, Dracula appearing young and handsome during daylight, meets and charms Mina. When Mina receives word from Jonathan, who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent, she travels to Romania to marry him. In his fury, Dracula transforms Lucy, her best friend, into a vampire. The men: Van Helsing, Holmwood, Seward and Morris kill Lucy. After Jonathan and Mina return to London, Jonathan and Van Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey, where they destroy the Count's boxes of soil. Dracula confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina's friends, but a confused and angry Mina admits that she still loves him and remembers her previous life as Elisabeta. At her insistence, Dracula begins transforming her into a vampire. The men are now determined to save her before her transformation is complete by killing Dracula.<br/><br/>What makes this film so special compared to other Dracula movies? I think it was Gary Oldman's performance, he made a very memorable Dracula. Ranging from creepy and disturbing to romantic and charming. I think a lot of people connected with the love story, even if it was over romanticized, a lot of people would like to think that ""love never dies"" and someone would ""cross oceans of time to find them"". Does the film have flaws; oh yeah. Between the laugh fest that was the battle of the bad accents between Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder. There are scenes that are very over the top and over acted, sometimes also equaling a little too MTV generation. However, you cannot deny that the style of the film is absolutely memorizing and very elegant. The costumes and sets are very stunning and who could forget Dracula's ""butt"" hair-do? This film has had so many parodies making fun of the lines and hair, but I think that goes to show the impact that the film had. It also started a stream of the Universal Studio remakes with ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" and ""Wolf"" later on. The film may be flawed, but I still love it. It's not faithful to the novel, but gets more things correct compared to other films like Dracula's death and some lines directly taken from the novel like ""Yes, I too can love"". I think this will go down in the horror classics when it comes to vampire movies, it's got class, violence, blood, style and a lot of sex appeal.<br/><br/>8/10"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","121","175","22 April 2006"," A Treat For The Eyes And Ears
","As is the case with many of these latter-day horror movies, this is visually stunning. This one is particularly so, with beautiful colors, wild special effects, lavish sets and a handful of pretty women, led by Winona Ryder.<br/><br/>It isn't all beauty; there are some horrific, bloody moments in here. I've seen the film three times and the first two times was terrifying to me in parts. The last viewing wasn't as scary, but maybe I was distracted by seeing this on DVD for the first time, which enhanced the visuals and added some nice 5.1surround sound.<br/><br/>At two hours and 10 minutes, it's a bit long but there are very few lulls, if any. Gary Oldham gives his normal intense performance as Dracula and it never hurts to have Anthony Hopkins in the film. <br/><br/>The only negative I found was Keannu Reeves, who sounds a bit wooden in his lines. Is it my imagination, or is he a terrible actor? Maybe it's just his voice. Nonetheless, Cary Elwes, Richard Grant, Sadie Frost and Bill Campbell all give good support to this film which is a real feast for the senses."
"jhclues","9","107","156","24 March 2001"," An Artistically Rendered Tale Of Darkness
","The most famous vampire in the history of literature and film is brought graphically to life in `Bram Stoker's Dracula,' directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and starring Gary Oldman as the Count from Transylvania.  Working from a screenplay (by James Victor Hart) that is a faithful adaptation of the novel, Coppola takes an artistic approach to the material and creates some startling and effective images-- some quite intense and erotic-- to tell the story of Count Dracula and his world of the undead.  Unsettling at times, and often shocking, the film is mesmerizing and thoroughly engrossing, delivered with a full palette of colors and shadows that form a backdrop against which the characters so vividly emerge to play out the drama.  It's a visual and emotional feast that is satisfying in every respect, beginning with a brief history of Dracula and the circumstances of his life that ultimately allied him with the forces of darkness and evil. 	Initially, the casting of Gary Oldman as Dracula seemed inauspicious and ill advised; in retrospect, the choice of Oldman was inspired.  Though many actors have done the role before and since (Schreck, Lugosi and Lee, just to name a few), Oldman manages to make the character uniquely his own, with a nuanced performance infused with depth and acuity.  Even when delivering famous, oft quoted lines from previously filmed versions of the story (Lugosi's `Children of the night, what music they make,' for instance), Oldman makes them spontaneous and fresh, with a conversational tone that makes you feel as if you're hearing them for the first time.  His presence is self-assured and menacing, which makes the character strong and intimidating, and you sense his longevity and the dark wisdom afforded him by his many years of existence.  There is a fastidiousness about Oldman's methods of inhabiting a character that makes you wonder if there is anything as an actor that is beyond his grasp.  At this point, I would think not. 	As Van Helsing, Anthony Hopkins puts his personal stamp on a well known character as well.  His portrayal of the famous professor is zealous and lively, and touched with an eccentricity that makes him an interesting and welcome presence in the film.  Winona Ryder, too, gives a believable performance as Mina, a somewhat emotionally challenging role she addresses with the restraint demanded of her by the character.  With her dark, winsome looks and natural intensity she is perfect for the part, and displays a femininity that contrasts well with the overt sexuality of Dracula's three `brides.'  And Tom Waits gives a memorable performance as the mad, insect-eater, Renfield, as does Sadie Frost, as Lucy, Mina's young and nubile best friend who unwittingly falls prey to Dracula's dark powers.  The single member of the cast who seems to struggle a bit with characterization is Keanu Reeves, as Jonathan Harker; he gives a passable performance, but fails to ever get a firm grasp of the character.  Still, he has an engaging presence and, though lacking depth, his portrayal is at least credible enough to maintain the continuity of the film. 	The supporting cast includes Richard E. Grant (Dr. Seward), Cary Elwes (Lord Holmwood) and Bill Campbell (Quincey).  Exacting in detail and imaginatively rendered, Coppola's `Bram Stoker's Dracula,' is an impressive, memorable film.  By boldly juxtaposing images and shadows, embracing the innate sensuality of the vampire, and blending it all together so seamlessly, Coppola has taken his film, not only to the zenith of the horror genre, but beyond.  It's a journey into the regions beyond the known, wherein the forces of darkness thrive and survive; a cinematic experience you'll not soon forget, courtesy of Coppola, a superlative cast, and the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10."
"Sleepin_Dragon","9","8","9","16 January 2020"," A visual feast.
","I have seen multiple versions of Dracula, but none compare to 1992's version starring Gary Oldman, the definitive Count Dracula in my opinion. This film is lavish, decadent and wonderfully vivid. It captured the gothic spirit of the novel, it's deep, romantic, and mixed with tender and violent moments. The visuals to this day are exquisite, the costumes, sets and scenes of Victorian England are superb.<br/><br/>Oldman is incredible, but the supporting cast of Reeves, Hopkins and Ryder are terrific, Winona Ryder's delicate character is superb. The accompanying soundtrack was also fantastic, great songs from Annie Lennox.<br/><br/>A true classic. 9/10"
"silicondoc","10","31","44","21 March 2006"," The best Dracula movie ever made.
","I have watched this movie probably ten times. It is no doubt the best Dracula movie ever made. The cinematography is superb, the sound effects are absolutely incredible. It is enchanting, haunting, endearing, and enthralling all at once. It is the type of movie that is done so well it seems there are endless stories within it, and you can certainly lose all sense of yourself when watching it. Absolutely tremendous. Top of the line. A classic for all time. It has a bit of a good western in it, some of the old style early movies, plenty of modern visual effects, a good amount of sexual flair without overdoing it, the enduring innocence of the several young ladies that lighten the screen. The first person storytelling aspect that fades in and out is also a very well done key effect, detaching you from the scenes in an observant listener fashion without danger of entering, allowing you to witness or imagine the coming horror unfolding, then drawing you in deep within the screen until you're lost in it's essence.<br/><br/>Tremendous film. Definitely recommend. Do not deprive yourself."
"tfrizzell","Null","122","195","18 April 2003"," Interesting and Mostly Accurate Take on the Horror Classic.
","""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is one of those films that reeled people in by making its audience believe that it would be an intense horror film on par with productions like ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""The Exorcist"". Instead, director Francis Ford Coppola stayed more true to Stoker's novel and put a focus on an intense love story that transcends time, the elements and even life and death. This naturally turned off many horror enthusiasts who would rather see a film that thrives on shock value rather than a movie that thrives on heart, brains and emotion. The film is naturally about the titled character, an immortal man (played superbly by the nearly always exceptional Gary Oldman) who has turned against God and now lives through the powers of darkness. By the late-19th Century, the titled character is trying to lure back a reincarnation of his one true love (Winona Ryder) and of course attempting to eliminate all those that might stand in his way (Ryder's fiance Keanu Reeves and professor Anthony Hopkins most notably). Overall ""Dracula"" is an amazingly good looking film that benefits from high production values and guaranteed performances (mainly from Oldman and Hopkins). Coppola's direction is strong, but a bit overbearing at times and sometimes it is unclear what the tone of the production truly is. Watch for Italian beauty Monica Bellucci as one of Oldman's beautiful, but deadly wives. 4 stars out of 5."
"ienge","10","151","248","16 December 2004"," After Gary Oldman as Dracula, there is no other Dracula
","This movie I feel has not gotten high enough vote in your system. Therefore I gave it 10 points despite a few details that would normally deprive it of one point.These are firstly that the character of Jonathan does not measure up to the standards of the rest of the actors. The second little detail is the scene with the party where Lucy joins together her worshipers. Quincy is holding his hat in front of the sofa when Lord Holmwood arrives. The next time we see him he is given his hat with apologies from the doctor Jack Seward who apparently has sat down on the hat. He already sat there in the former scene when Quincy is holding the hat. Very irritating with such a big blunder in a super movie like that. Now, what makes the movie a ""tenner"" is everything else, in particular Gary Oldmans interpretation of the count, and Anthony Hopkins as doctor van Helsing.The scene with Mina and Dracula in bed is one of the greatest romantic scenes ever, and sure to make any girl cry."
"Cheetah-6","10","122","198","14 January 2002"," Lush and Sensual
","This one really nails it.  Lush, sensual, sexy\gory, beautiful and creepy. With just the right touch of humor to keep it in perspective. Tom Waits as Renfield gone bonkers is great comic relief.  Nosferatu of 1922 or Werner Herzog's version of 1979 are also very good but they've got nothing on this one. It stands well with them and is a must for any Vampire story lover. This one pulls of Dracula's story in high style!  One of Coppola's Best works."
"stamper","9","107","173","29 October 2001"," One of the most romantic stories ever told
","The background of this story is the myth / legend of Count Vlad Dracula (son of count Dracul) nicknamed' Vlad Tepes (Vlad the impaler). Vlad was, as the film tells us a warlord in the 15th century who fought the Turks. According to the myth he drank the blood of his victims and impaled them. This is a real myth, as it was and maybe even is still believed in Rumania. A lot of information about Vlad Dracula was later gathered by Irish writer Bram Stoker, who, combined it with myths of vampires into this tale of the well known blood -sucking Vampire. Another thing that is real in this film are the pictures in the book Vampyr, which is read by van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) in this movie. The pictures you find there are also to be found in history and school books, complete with ancient writings beside them.<br/><br/>
I will not reveal to you the nature of the plot, but I must say this bloody horror film is one of the most sad and romantic stories ever told. It is about a man who loses his wife and cannot rejoin her in another life. So he turns against anything people in the 15th century believed in and is punished by god to wander the earth as the undead. He is cursed to be feared and hunted, for he needs to drink the blood of man to keep alive. He is nosferatu (vamyr), he is Count Dracula.<br/><br/>
He lives miserably for about 400 years until he falls in love again. And by doing so we are dragged into the fortune and misery of a creature who lives eternally. He is alive, but lifeless on the inside. He is rich, gentle and loving, yet he must feast on humans to survive. He is damned forever, whilst he did not do anything wrong.<br/><br/>
The settings of this great story is late 19th century Europe (England and Karpathia). Karpathia is not well known to man, the wild side of Europe. All this bears with it the mysticism of this story and the epic and tragic background. As for Dracula (Gary Oldman) himself, he drags us into a world of blood, lust and erotica. He seems only to be driven by his great love for Mina (Winona Ryder) and the need of being together with her. TRUE LOVE<br/><br/>
There are some great (and famous) actors in this film: Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder, Gary Oldman, Cary Elwes and Keanu Reeves. They all contribute greatly to this film, although I must say that the best acting comes from Gary Oldman (Dracula), Sadie Frost (Lucy), Sir Anthony Hopkins (van Helsing) and music legend Tom Waits (Renfield). Do not get me wrong the rest is good to and do their job's well, but these four really put the dot on the i.<br/><br/>
Besides the actors there are a lot of things that stand out (look at the list of prizes and nominations at the Oscars), but I must say two people are left unaccounted for there. The director Francis Ford Copolla and the genius behind the haunting and touching music Wojciech Kilar. They both bring so much to the greatness of this film, I would have felt like an idiot if I had left them out.<br/><br/>
This does not  only make an excellent horror / epic / romantic film, but surely is (in my opinion) a great date flick, about love everlasting and the tragedy of a man who is cursed to live forever and roam the world alone, for he is feared and hunted.<br/><br/>

"rturner231","1","142","234","31 July 2006"," Coppola ruins a great novel by adding his own flavor.
","I was supremely disappointed by this, ""Bram Stoker's"" Dracula. I have read the classic novel by Bram Stoker, and I don't think this would have gained his approval. The only things common between the movie and the book are the names of the characters, and that Count Dracula is from Transylvania. I don't know why Francis Ford Coppola felt he had to spice up a story that has stood up for generations of scrutiny as a classic story of good vs. evil and dress it as a love story. There is a reason that other horrible characters have been created in literature, but there are only a few that endure. Dracula is one of them, and it is because of the chills a reader feels when in his presence in the world Stoker created. The novel has suspense, feeling, and good, noble characters throughout. The movie has none of these qualities. <br/><br/>Everyone in the book has their own vices and greatness. Dr. Seward: doubtful but brave. Dr. Van Helsing: brilliant and cunning. Quincey Morris: simple and impetuous. Arthur Holmwood: sophisticated and selfless. Jonathan Harker: loving and loyal. Coppola manages to remove all these qualities from the characters in this movie. But the worst tragedy of them all was the butchering of the character of Mina Harker. She is the heroine in Stoker's story, a great woman who was indispensable in their pursuit and ultimate destruction of the monster. In the movie, she is the reincarnation of Dracula's lost bride and loses all of her charm and any connection with the audience by pining for an undead demon. Who, by the way, Coppola manages to humanize by somehow justifying his thirst for blood by showing us how much he loved his bride hundreds of years ago. <br/><br/>If I had not read the book, I might be less disappointed with the movie. I did enjoy Anthony Hopkins' performance as Dr. Van Helsing, although he turned the doctor into a bit of a religious crackpot. I have never seen the ""Dracula"" starring Bela Lugosi, but I intend to, if for no other reason to go back to a time where movie makers developed plot lines and characters rather than just splashing blood and bared chests across the screen."
"petra_ste","6","11","14","6 August 2007"," I have offended you with my ignorance, forgive me
","This Dracula adaptation accomplishes a seemingly impossible task: it's both a quite faithful AND an astonishingly unfaithful adaptation of Stoker's novel. It's faithful because no other adaptation I know of keeps all the characters of Holmwood, Seward and Quincey Morris. Besides, apart for the prologue, the story is basically true to the Transylvania (first act)/London (second act) /Transylvania (ending) structure of the novel.<br/><br/>And yet Coppola's movie is, character-wise, very much unfaithful to the book: the Count is a tragic character rather than a soulless monster; Mina is the reincarnation of Dracula's lost wife, so the script actually develops a romance between the two. Now, when it comes to adaptations I am not against changes, AS LONG AS the final result is true to the spirit of the book: here, it's not.<br/><br/>The always awesome Oldman is a charismatic and chilling presence as Dracula, but other performances are either forgettable (Ryder, Elwes) or hammy (Grant, Frost, Hopkins). I was especially disappointed by the latter: his Van Helsing is turned into a comedic character, a sort of Grampa Simpson on drugs. Waits is an effective Reinfield, but the fact Dr. Seward is so absurdly over-the-top makes their scenes together ridiculous - the madman here does not seem weirder than his doctor.<br/><br/>The worst is by far a miserable Keanu Reeves, here the very portrait of hilarious miscasting, who appears to break the fourth wall while uttering the quote I put in the review title. With his repugnant English accent and laughable delivery - my favorite lines being ""if I may inquire"", ""blue inferno"" and especially ""Look! He's grown young!"", which had me howling with laughter - he gives the kind of performance which should be punishable by law.<br/><br/>At least Dracula is visually compelling: it's luscious, with interesting composition, odd colour palettes, memorable costumes - Coppola toying with every trick of the medium.<br/><br/>6,5/10"
"p_liles","1","106","180","24 January 2006"," Very little even watchable material in this film
","There are two good things about ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". They are: Gary Oldman (as Dracula) and Anthony Hopkins (as Professor Abraham Van Helsing).<br/><br/>Other than that the negatives regarding this movie are seemingly endless. I'll touch of the main problems.<br/><br/>1. This movie had beautiful costumes and sets, but I was unable to enjoy them with the herky jerky camera editing that the director Francis Ford Coppala decided to go with. I got a headache trying to focus on the action.<br/><br/>2. Many movies have been made based on books. There are varying degrees of staying true to the original story. However, if you title your film ""BRAM STOKER'S Dracula"", then you better stay true to Bram Stoker's version of the story. I had just read the book, and was eagerly anticipating the film. It didn't take long to see that most of the original story is either simply ignored or actually changed. I'm not talking about minor details. I am talking about major themes in the book that are totally destroyed. The movie should have been named ""Coppala's Vampire"", then I wouldn't have wasted my money on going to the theater to see it.<br/><br/>3. This movie, in my opinion, has to be one of the worst cast films in the history of movie-making. At least, when you consider that the two main characters are played by Keanu Reeves and Wynona Rider. They are two of the most limited actors in Hollywood, and should never have even been allowed to read the script in the first place. As bad as they are, they do not even give a good performance even by their standards, most likely due to the poor matching of script to abilities.<br/><br/>Watching this movie is literally one of my least favorite movie-going experiences ever. It's basically a case of ""three strikes and you're out"", because of the poor acting/casting, lack of staying even close to the original story & irritating editing that leaves you straining to focus on what's happening."
"bob the moo","Null","60","98","14 November 2003"," A rich telling near the source material
","Opening with his vow to rise from his grave and take revenge on a God who allowed his beloved to die while he defended Him on the battlefield, we see Count Dracula in the 1890's, conducting business with a London firm.  When his first consultant goes mad, Jonathon Harker is sent to Dracula in his place, only to find himself trapped in the castle.  Meanwhile, Dracula travels to London where he feeds on the lovely Lucy Westenra.  Her various suitors try to help her and call for Professor Van Helsing to come and help  they realise that this is not a simple battle against a disease of the blood.<br/><br/>Although a little too long for my liking, this film is a very rich gothic telling of a story that has become watered down slightly with the many different versions of stories with the characters.  Here the basic plot follows the tale from the creation of Dracula, his love and his confrontation with Van Helsing and the various suitors of the lovely Lucy. The story is told with a real respect for the source, perhaps a little too much as it can be a little to heavy and lacking in spark at times.  However, for the most part the gothic telling works very well and feels very lavish and rich.<br/><br/>Visually the film is great  rich colours in the scenery and costumes really bring the goth out of the film.  Meanwhile Coppola works well with shadows and images in the backgrounds to make the film have the feel of an old silent movie version (eyes in the storm) but with modern standards.  It's not really scary, but I didn't need it to be, I was more interested in the overall story, and that worked well.<br/><br/>The cast suffer from a bit too much respect for the material, some of their performances are a little too hammy and heavy.  Oldman is good when compared to the better known image of the `Bela Lagosi' Dracula, but I did still find him a little too hammy at times.  Likewise Rider is not totally convincing. Hopkins is quite fun to watch and the three suitors (including Ewles and Grant) very much play stiff upper lipped straight men!  Of course of their performances tower with majesty above the sheer miscast ineptitude of Reeves.  From the start his accent is horrid, but his inability to bring out emotions and character basically kills his character off before the film has even got going.<br/><br/>Despite this the film is actually very enjoyable even if it is a bit too respectful and long  occasionally making it feel a little heavy going.  The rich presentation and loyalty to the source material makes for a very enjoyable story even if it isn't really what we'd see now as a horror."

","While Bram Stoker's Dracula was being made, the press made a lot of stink regarding this as Coppola's ""Cape Fear"", referring to Scorsese's big-budget remake of the original of 1962.  Scorsese did a commendable update of that flick, but Coppola, a director known for his eccentricity and innovation, has taken an old myth and turned it upside down.  I've never seen such visual effects, creating an expressionistic mood that would make F.W. Murnau (director of 1922's silent Nosferatu) proud.  This is German Expressionism and Dali mixed together in color. On top of its visual power is the treatment of the Dracula story, remaining very faithful to Stoker's vision.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman turns in his best performance to date, both terrifying and compassionate, and is the most frightening Count since Max Schreck donned the Dracula gear back in the 1922 original.  He takes on forms past filmmakers could only dream of putting on film.  Obviously, the chemistry between Winona Ryder & Oldman is there.  Hopkins is solid as always playing Professor Van Helsing, who has a few supernatural tricks of his own.  Of course, Keanu Reeves is as solid as a piece of plywood, but that's another story.<br/><br/>It's the visuals and effects that really put an auteur's mark on the picture. You can tell a lot of money was spent, but Coppola utilizes every penny (something he has failed to do in some past films i.e. One From the Heart, Rumble Fish).  We see some seriously disturbing images such as eyes in the sky and a stairwell in the Count's castle that seems to go beyond the infinite underneath.  What a movie.  This is a must see for all film fans and a reminder that Francis Ford Coppola has and always will be one of the best directors of all-time.  Just sit back and let the film assault your senses."

","A young lawyer named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves, though Coppola has openly criticized his own reasoning for casting Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker ; according to him, he needed a young, hot star that would connect with the girls) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe . He is captured and imprisoned by a strange vampire and his bloodsucker girlfriends . He really is a 15th-century Romanian warrior who lives on through the ages and gone back life . Avenging the death of his beloved wife ; the undead vampire named Dracula (Gary Oldman , among those who auditioned for the part were Andy Garcia , Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas and Viggo Mortensen) comes to England to seduce a visitor's fiancée (Winona Rider) and inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers , but these supernatural powers have sinister origins . Dracula starts a reign of seduction and horror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost) . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords (Gary Elwes , Bill Campbell , Keanu Reeves) acquiring the assistance of the Vampire expert Prof. Abraham Van Helsing 8anthony Hopkins) .<br/><br/>Colorful version about the famous personage with an all-star cast , brilliant cinematography by Michael Balhaus , glamorous gowns and spectacular production design by Thomas Sanders , including evocative sights on Victorian London . And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in ¨Mishima¨ produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup. <br/><br/>This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : ""Bram Stoker's Count Dracula"" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; ¨ Dracula¨ (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , ¨Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version ¨Dracula¨2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula ."

I am sitting here in my living room literally unable to come to terms with how execrable this 'film'was.<br/><br/>How anyone can think this is good is quite beyond me. A few points: -The look of the film is not 'grandiose' or 'lush', it is crap. The effects are crap, the sets are crap. It's just a royal glut of crapness from start to finish.<br/><br/>-Every cast member excerpt Gary Oldman turns in a career-worst performance par excellence.<br/><br/>-Calling it 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is an exercise bordering on the farcical. This film should be called 'Francis Ford Coppola's unashamed molestation of Dracula, aided and abetted by the most staggeringly inept fake English accents ever committed to celluloid'.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves' English accent is (deep breath) worse, yes WORSE than Dick Van Dyke's horrific cockney aberration from Mary Poppins. This in itself is quite an achievement and almost makes the film worth watching. Actually, no it doesn't.<br/><br/>To sum up, by all that you hold dear do not watch this film.

","DRACULA gets off to a great start as 15th century Romania finds itself on the front line against muslim hordes charging into Europe leading to a Romanian hero losing the love of his life <br/><br/>That`s the best part of the film . Other good aspects of DRACULA carry on throughout the movie , aspects like the very moody cinematography and the very impressive visual tricks , but there`s things that clog up the works , things like the intrusive ham acting on display . A lot of people have commented on Anthony Hopkins ham performance but I don`t have a problem with it and neither do I have a problem with Gary Oldman`s performance either . I do however have a problem with Sadie Frost`s performance as Lucy and Tom Waits as Renfield , both give over emphatic performances while both Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder are utterly unconvincing as 19th characters from England ,both are miscast and they`re not even bad enough to be entertaining. Francis Ford Coppola`s directing style may lead to accusations of "" ham "" directing  ie over directing but it should be remembered this directing style was very common in the early 1990s and a lot of American directors did this most notably Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone . I do wish Coppola had more input into the script ( He is one of the best and most under rated screenwriters Hollywood has produced ) because the one here by James V Hart isn`t all that good . The dialogue isn`t memorable and in several scenes , especially romantic ones , it`s rather corny . It`s also rather over long and not very well paced , but I`m led to believe Bram Stoker`s novel is badly structured but even so that`s no excuse <br/><br/>This version of Dracula has its moments but it`s never the sum of its parts.

","There will never be a more sexually drawing and enticing performance of Dracula then there was in this. Gary Oldman has been the best and, most likely, always will be. His ability to use several accents makes his Dracula a dark, mysterious, sexually arousing lover and character. It makes some forget the true horror he is supposed to instill, but that shall never be a problem in my book. It would have received a 10 if Lucy's lovers didn't always seem to be sucking up to her or another one person. They just seemed to be constantly quarreling in their minds about one another and always trying to win Lucy from Arthur! This should of course seem normal, but just makes them seem weak. Overall though this movie is great for Romance and slight amounts of Horror."

","It is called ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" The title is deceiving.<br/><br/>This film is an incoherent mess, to put it rather bluntly.<br/><br/>The effects, which look beautiful, only take away from the story-- you forget that this is a vampire movie and you are left with an impression that it is a special effects promo. And for crying out loud, what is with that tagline ""Love Never Dies?"" This film has taken a classic story and mutated it into a romance. Granted, there were huge romantic elements in the original Dracula-- the gothic horror classics such as it and Frankenstein flowed elegantly like poetry, and romance was used. But this film has taken something that Bram Stoker never intended and made it the key focus: Mina is now a riencarnation of a lover who Dracula lost while still Vlad the Impaler, and the whole film is basically an endless trek as they find each other and rediscover their lost love. OOOOKAY!<br/><br/>As far as events in the book goes, it is pretty accurate, but that's not the point. The point is, they completely changed the focus on some kind of unnesseccary love story. If Coppola had made the film an accurate account of the legend, it would have worked great. If he had changed the title from ""Bram Stoker's"", I might have liked it a little better (Even though the endless effects, as I have mentioned, made it mind-numbing and incoherent). Instead, it is only boring, tedious, and an insult to everything Bram Stoker hoped to accomplish. Poor Mr. Stoker....If he knew such trash like this would come out of his work, I'm sure he would have never written it.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good Dracula film, watch the Klause Kinski version of Nosferatu. It certainly isn't faithful to the novel, but at least it doesn't PRETEND to be,  like this sorry excuse for a Dracula epic does.<br/><br/>I would give this film a negative two hundred on a scale of one to ten, if not for Anthony Hopkin's brilliant performance as Van Helsing. Truly, he's the only brillaint thing about it."

"jaredpahl","8","12","17","30 October 2016"," Coppola's Dracula Is An Atmospheric Masterpiece That Falls Just Short Of Greatness
","Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic vampire story is unlike any other film I have ever seen. A beautifully crafted Gothic horror romance, Bram Stoker's Dracula is infinitely rich in haunting atmosphere, but a conventional love story prevents it from becoming truly great.<br/><br/>Bram Stoker's Dracula is a mostly faithful adaptation of the original novel, telling the story of Dracula's quest to find his long lost love through four characters, Keanu Reeves' lawyer Jonathan Harker, who experiences Dracula first-hand after being imprisoned in his castle, Harker's fiancé Mina Murray played by Winona Ryder, the subject of Dracula's affection, Van Helsing the vampire hunter, played by Anthony Hopkins, and the man himself, Dracula, played with intensity by Gary Oldman. All four principle actors do well in their parts, lending a heightened drama to the fantastical story. Reeves is comfortably quiet as the straight man in the story. Ryder is an attractive presence on screen, wisely dialing back on the melodrama that may have infected her performance. Conversely, Anthony Hopkins gives a delightfully over-the-top turn as a man obsessed with killing Dracula. And speaking of the Count, Gary Oldman's irritating habit of wildly over-acting is actually channeled here into something incredibly watchable. Dracula is a fascinating presence every time he's on screen, especially when he's wearing Eiko Ishioka's brilliant costumes or sporting some of the most convincing creature makeup I have ever seen. <br/><br/>The problem with the narrative in Bram Stoker's Dracula is that it spends too much time on an somewhat standard love story. Winona Ryder's character is well written and her arc works well enough, but at a certain point, the erotic love scenes only carry so much weight. I was far more interested in Dracula's point of view, and aesthetically, I simply wanted to spend more time in his castle. The first chunk of the film is so consistently engaging, both visually and thematically, that it is a pity that the rest of the movie never manages to get back to that level. I can't say I have a real problem with the love story. Like the rest of the film, it's well written, crafted, and acted, but the Dracula point of view as well as Van Helsing's vampire hunt were both more interesting story lines than the conventional love story, and I wish they would've gotten more screen time in comparison.<br/><br/>Even with nagging problems regarding the story, I can't deny the power Coppola infuses into this film atmospherically. The costumes, music, sets, and special effects are uniformly amazing and they work together seamlessly with Coppola's direction to create a final product that is uniquely Coppola and uniquely Dracula. From the first shot of the film, Dracula is constantly surprising as a audio/visual experience. The first 45 minutes in particular showcase some of the most captivating visuals ever put on film. The opening flashback sequence alone is masterfully designed, composed, and shot. There is a heightened reality to the sequence, a storybook detachment that had me transfixed on the screen from the first second, and it didn't let up. The time spent in Dracula's castle is the highlight of the entire film, with the vast corridors of the castle illuminating with eerie shadows in some of the most daring and artistic cinematography I've ever seen. Dracula himself is a haunting creation, as he glides and coils about in an unsettlingly alien manner. The film never gets back to the same level of atmospheric intensity after we leave the castle, and that is a real shame, but still, Coppola continually shows us new visual tricks and inventive effects throughout the film. As a sensory experience, everything works. Coppola gives the film a breathtaking visual signature, utilizing age old camera tricks and special effects to create something that puts you in another world. It's not just unique locations we're treated to, it's a unique method of filmmaking. Wojciech Kilar's music is similarly special. Big, bold, haunting, and dramatic; the soundtrack here is exceptional. The same can be said for the costumes and makeup. There is a boldness to every technical department here.<br/><br/>In Bram Stoker's Dracula, Francis Ford Coppola has created something daring, ambitious, and different in the best way possible. Unfortunately, the movie's best section is its first, and the story lingers too long on it's least interesting story line. While those complaints keep the film from being truly great, they don't stop Bram Stoker's Dracula from showcasing a master filmmaker's unique vision. This is a special film, an extraordinary sensory experience, a 2 hour journey to a dark, foreboding dreamworld that I won't soon forget.<br/><br/>85/100"

","Vampires, nosferatu and the undead have become somewhat of a cultural phenomenon over the years, with the countless re-tellings of the primera vampire story that is Dracula. From the publication of Bram Stoker's novel in 1897, it has succeeded in evoking fear and terror into the hearts and minds of the millions who read the Gothic magnum opus. There have been many adaptations of the Dracula story; F.W Murnau's German expressionist masterpiece, Bela Lugosi's elegant and sublime portrayal and Christopher Lee's various 'fangtastic' performances.<br/><br/>But for me the most faithful and best movie adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel is without a doubt 1992's aptly named 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'. With Francis Ford Coppola at the helm, what could go wrong? The movie was fabulous, visually stunning and capturing all the various aspects of the Dracula myth; the dark, Gothic horror and romantic sympathetic cruelty of Dracula's fate. And the cast was also fantastic with Gary Oldman doing a great job at the very complex and difficult role of Dracula and Anthony Hopkin's brilliant portrayal of his nemesis Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Winona Ryder was wonderful as Mina Murray as was Richard E Grant and Sadie Frost as Dr. Jack Seward and Lucy Westerner respectively. But the only disappointment was Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker. What horrible casting! Reeves' performance was drab and boring from his first terrible lines of dialogue, pulling off a hopeless English accent and making himself look the idiot acting opposite such distinguished actors as Oldman and Hopkins. Despite this little hitch, I felt that 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' was absolutely brilliant, with exceptional performances (minus Keanu), a great script and Coppola's usual genius as a director, this is one the best films of all time. I loved this movie."
"MamzelleLilliette","1","71","128","30 January 2007"," Francis Ford Copolla should get on his knees and BEG for forgiveness from Bram Stoker!!!!
","Firstly, I'm NOT going to say that the story of Dracula is strictly for Gothic culture (whatever's left of it) because, truthfully, such a fabulous example for literature is something that anybody of refined taste should enjoy. However, Dracula, due to being a story about the children of the night and their haunting impulse on the world of the living, has become associated with Gothicism. But it makes the Gothic genre of art and literature (I'm referring to Byron, Henry Fuseli, the Romantics etc) look poor and squalid because of the way it has been TAKEN and MAIMED by modern day Hollywood. Now this review is not about me personally, but I want to mention how I, as a Gothic, can no longer look at this story and admire it. Want to know why? Because every time I hear the name 'Dracula', horny, tanned and frankly un-vampiric Gary Oldman and his groaning, self-orgasm-ing miniature Harem (the three brides, Mina AND Lucy, for those of you who didn't guess) fill my head! What has Francis Ford Copolla done?! What possessed him to mutate such a beautiful piece of Victorian literature? And what the Hell makes him think-HONESTLY THINK-that his pornographic, dirty, lecherous,flea bitten vision is SO worthy of the title ""Bram Stoker's"" Dracula?<br/><br/>I could talk all night about the mistakes he's made. For one thing, Johnnathen Harker and Mina Murray, not just as sweethearts but also as aristocratic Victorians, have a CHASTE and PURE relationship; a relationship that does not require sloppy, sweaty sex to show virtue and passion. F.F.Copolla has not only discarded of Johnnathen Harker's importance to the story, he has also totally distorted Mina's gentle, heroic character by pretending to himself that she is actually Dracula's long lost reincarnated 'love'. Having a tag line like 'LOVE NEVER DIES' and a theme of love between Dracula, the wraith, and Mina, the maiden, is ludicrous.Its not only ludicrous because its NEVER what Bram Stoker intended; its also ridiculous because Mina and Dracula DO NOT love each other! How can Dracula rape Lucy, have a harem of brides AND adore Mina all at once? Whenever the two are around each other they behave like sex-deprived, sex-seeking, silly little lustful teenagers-sucking each others nipples and canoodling each other in public places. Where is the love-REAL love-in that?<br/><br/>You see, the Victorians had extremely strict ideals about love and marriage. Mainly all marriage was prearranged, the entire point of the corset was to keep a woman faithful to her husband (the husband laced her corset up in a specific way so that, if it was ever undone and then redone up, he could tell.)...and the characters in Bram Stokers book just go to show that that scummy thing we call 'sex appeal' is not actually important. Stokers characters are valiant, beautiful, in corrupt. Or were. <br/><br/>I think Copolla should be ashamed for ruining such a beautiful story. If he wanted to make a movie-another scummy excuse of a vampire movie-he should have wrought it with his own story and his own characters. Why he felt he had to deform this perfectly beautiful story about the triumph of purity over Death, is beyond me. And I will hate him forever for what he has done."
"80sHorror","10","16","24","1 May 2012"," Visually stunning!! a classic
","Francis Ford Coppala's approach is unlike Bram Stoker's famous book, not horror, but more an approach to the Love-side of the story. There still is a lot of horror in the film that really frightens you, but the story is more centerd around the tragic lovelife of count Dracula. Also, another thing that makes this movie a really fascinating movie experience, is because of some erotic scenes. They make the scenes extremely powerful which really helps to power the emotion and the horror. It also makes it the most erotic Dracula film ever.<br/><br/>The movie is made with beautiful sets and colour. There is a real colour theme going on in the movie that is truly maqnificent and which pleases the eye. The use of music and sound is also fantastically done. It makes it more frightening and exciting. The casting of this masterpiece is absolutely perfect. Gary Oldman plays the count Dracula with true emotion and lust. He steals the show. Also, Winona Ryder as the lovely Mina does a fantastic job. With further rolls of Anthony Hopkins as the professor Van Hesling,(who plays him with lots of joy and wickedness. He is the one who brings some humor into the dark world the movie is in), Keanu Reaves as Jonathan (A great choice for the part), and Sadie Frost as Lucy (Who really acts great! She made quite an impression on me because she played Lucy perfectly) makes this a wonderful movie experience.<br/><br/>So are you in for a night of Horror, Erotica, Love, Action, great special effects and a lot of Vampire teeth? Than ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is the movie for you to see. This movie will truly amaze you from beginning to end. When the credits role over the screen, you do understand the tagline of the movie: Love Never Dies. Worth viewing many times!"
"punk_rawk_chick18","1","75","138","16 September 2006"," Awful adaptation of the book
","I saw Bram Stoker's Dracula last year without having any knowledge whatsoever of the book. As I watched it, I was almost certain that it was an inaccurate representation as there is so much vile nudity and violence that it seemed to be a glimpse into Coppola's disgusting, misogynistic brain rather than a 19th Century classic. I have just finished the book and I would like to proudly say I am correct. Although the book subverts women entirely and paints them as weak, timid creatures that need to be protected by men, they are at least far from wanton (except, of course, for the siren-like vampires). Lucy's character is completely corrupted from what Stoker intended her to be, and never in the book does Mina even have the slightest desire to become a vampire. There is NO love between Dracula and Mina and this is absolutely crucial to the story. This does NOT add a 'cool twist,' nor make the story any more interesting. It betrays the original Victorian notions that are embedded into the story and turns it into a gratuitous, abhorrent representation of modern Hollywood. Dracula is the embodiment of pure evil; he abhors life, purity, goodness and wishes to gather as many that he can to join in his evil existence and to do his bidding. The love in this story comes from Van Helsing, Dr Seward and most of all the love between Jonathan and Mina. The ending of the book captures this beautifully, yet this horrid film (no pun intended) fails to graciously offer its audience a glimpse into what this story is about."

","This 1992 version of the Bram Stoker novel is different from the previous Dracula movies that were made in 1931, 1958 and 1979. The visual style is stunning and I just love they way they handled the characters.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the best thing about this movie is Gary Oldman in his role as the blood sucking count from Transylvannia. His Dracula is like a mix of the scary looking Nosferatu from ""Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens"" and the gentleman and sensual Dracula played by Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee in the earlier versions. The result is a Dracula that we can both fear and feel for. Yes, Gary Oldman really is my favorite Dracula (although not the best). The sequences between Oldman and Winona Ryder are really steamy, that was quite some passion on screen!<br/><br/>The movie handles all of the characters very well. All of the classic characters are present (Van Helsing, Mina, Harker, Renfield etc.). All of the characters are really deepen out, something that was not really the case in earlier Dracula movies which only really focused on Dracula's character. But that also brings me to the one problem I had with this movie. It focused on too many characters. It was kind of weird, in the beginning it only focused on Harker and Dracula, in the second halve mainly on Mina and the third halve mainly on Van Helsing, it was very inconsistent all.<br/><br/>Not only the main cast but also the supporting cast consists out of big names like Cary Elwes, Bill Campbell and Monica Bellucci.<br/><br/>The musical score by Wojciech Kilar is really on of the best and most fitting scores in movie history.

","If you want a plot summary, read some of the other reviews, because I don't want to regurgitate what they're saying. All I wanted to add was that this movie tops any of the Dracula films ever created, and actually goes so far as to make me appreciate the book more<br/><br/>Yes, the book. This is the ONLY Dracula movie ever to stick almost directly to Bram Stoker's novel, and it does so with only one variation. In the novel, Mina Harker never has an affair with the Count, and never speaks to him except from at her husband's side. For that matter, nothing of Elisabeta was ever mentioned; obviously all of this just popped out of Francis Ford Coppola's head, and I admire that. Other that that... the movie follows the book practically page by page, through Jonathan Harker's journal, through Mina's letters, through Jack Seward's diary, and through Abraham Van Helsing's letters. You can say what you like about how boring Keanu Reeves was, or how over-the-top Winona Ryder was, but I believe that the characters in the film were excellently copied from those in the book, and that the movie was extremely well casted. (Jonathan Harker WAS boring, and Mina WAS a bit melodramatic, by the way...)<br/><br/>I can't say which I like better, the book or the movie, but I can at least admit that Count Dracula is my favorite Gary Oldman role. The special effects and costuming are fantastic, and the supporting cast is amazing, as well. Anthony Hopkins's is the most true portrayal of Abraham (and the recently renamed ""Gabriel"") Van Helsing, of any other in film, and you can only love his eccentric-godfather sort of role to Jack Seward. The diversion of the film from the EVIL of Dracula, to his more human side, is much different from the book, and is both refreshing and attractive.<br/><br/>I have nothing more to say, except that any person who reads the novel, must next see this movie; it brings ideas to the mind that the book alone did not. Thank you for your time, and enjoy the show."

","This has to go down in film history as one of the greatest films that has ever been produced. As someone who is deeply interested in vampires and a big fan of the ""Dracula"" novel, I have been dying to see this film for years and when I first saw it about eighteen months ago it quite simply blew me away. This is the definitive film version of Bram Stoker's novel, and if anyone is not stunned by the magnificence of this film or the phenomenally good performance of Gary Oldman in the title role, then I think they should be checked for a pulse. This film left me literally speechless, and compared to the Christopher Lee versions of the 1950s, '60s and '70s, it stands up as being the most accurate and faithful screen adaptation of the novel that has ever been made. So all in all, this film is the one that any fan of the novel should see first, and I think once they have seen the Lee versions they will agree that this film is the very best and the most faithful to Stoker's novel.<br/><br/>To start with, Gary Oldman is the personification of the Dracula portrayed in the novel. Apart from looking almost exactly how the centuries-old vampire is described in the novel, his vocal and bodily performance is so unbelievably good that it will leave you transfixed. He wonderfully combines Dracula's charm, grace, sinister aspects, desire for revenge against God, lust for the women who surround themselves around Johnathan Harker, Van Helsing, Arthur Holmwood and Dr. Seward, and of course his thirst for human blood. He also portrays the lover who has lost his beloved to a remarkably good degree, and his superb acting of the scenes on the bed with Mina Harker brings a lump to the throat and a tear to the eye. It is often said that an actor's performance is ""electric,"" but even that isn't enough to describe the brilliance of Oldman as Dracula. ""Stunning,"" ""wonderful,"" or ""magnificent"" are closer to the mark when describing Oldman's portrayal. His sinister exclamation of Dracula's famous quote, ""Listen to them, the children of the night, what sweet music they make"" is particularly outstanding.<br/><br/>The other characters from the novel - Johnathan Harker (the estate agent who first meets Dracula), Mina Harker (his bride and the object of Dracula's affections), Lucy Westenra (Mina's friend), Arthur Holmwood (Lucy's husband-to-be), Quincey Morris (a Texan), Dr. Seward (a medical man) and Van Helsing (a professor and part-time vampire hunter) - are also brilliantly portrayed and given enough screen time to allow their characters to be developed as much as they need to be. Keanu Reeves is an excellent Johnathan Harker, sufficiently afraid while in Dracula's castle and determined enough to kill him back in England; Winona Ryder is a fantastic Mina/Elisabeth; Sadie Frost is a superb sweet, naive and flirtatious Lucy; Arthur, Seward and Quincey are portrayed well and make excellent vampire hunters; and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing is ten times better than the Peter Cushing version and a million miles closer to the eccentric genius portrayed in the novel. These characters, and Dracula himself, are portrayed beautifully and accurately in James V. Hart's stunning script, which adheres quite closely to Stoker's novel, including extracts from the novel and sufficient explanations to allow those who have not read the novel to understand and follow the plot.<br/><br/>The superb direction by Francis Ford Coppola is beyond any faults, and his handling of the bed scenes between Dracula and Mina is enough to bring out all the raw emotions and tears among the audience, let alone between the two characters themselves! The script is pure excellence and the prologue about Vlad the Impaler losing his bride (Elisabeth) after a battle between his people (the Transylvanians) and the Turks, then in his grief denying God's existence and avenging her death by becoming a vampire (i.e. Dracula) is superb and brings all the beliefs that Dracula was partly inspired by the real Vlad the Impaler bursting into a new light, and makes Dracula a sympathetic and tragic character, instead of the charming but deadly ladies' man as portrayed by Lee. The use of Romanian language in the prologue and later in the film adds authenticity to a beautiful and tear-jerking adaptation of the novel.<br/><br/>The music is one of the very best as heard in a film, and in places is so utterly fantastic it could almost be an undiscovered Beethoven's symphony. The scenery and costumes are beyond criticism, and offer a real sense of Transylvanian and English culture and tradition respectively. Dracula's red cloak, trailing behind him like a sea of blood, and the gold dragon on his chest (suggesting he is the dragon to Van Helsing's St. George) is wonderfully designed. The make-up of the elderly Dracula is sufficiently corpse-like yet alive enough to suggest quite rightly that Dracula is caught between life and death by his vampire's existence. The half-man, half-wolf and the half-man, half-bat versions of Dracula are wonderfully created with make-up and special effects (bearing in mind this film was made in 1992) and the death of Dracula at the end (his throat slashed by Johnathan Harker and his heart impaled by Quincey Morris) is beautifully written, acted and directed, and the scene where he reverts back to the young Vlad the Impaler and is finally allowed to die with Mina (the reincarnation of Elisabeth - hence his affections towards her) next to him is so tear-jerkingly wonderful it leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.<br/><br/>Stunning. Truly stunning. There's nothing more to be said about it."

","If you appreciate terrible set-design, bad lighting, gruesome effects, awful casting and incongruous overstated music.... This film is for you! The ONLY redeeming feature of this film is Gary Oldman (as mentioned ad-nauseam by all the other reviewers). This is a lame story, with some appalling acting thanks mostly to the casting. Keanu Reeves seldom is anything but wooden (with the delightful exception of his role in The Gift - where he aptly played a redneck) but with the addition of an English accent we now have a wooden Reeves alloyed with an out-of-his-depths Depp in 'From Hell' - a similarly dodgy slock- horror thing. If you appreciated the realism and grit of Coppola's Apocalypse Now, you'll hate this as I did. Everything that was awesome about that film is conspicuously absent in this one.

","Probably the most artistic and romantic version of Dracula you will ever see. If there were ever a Dracula movie to make you feel pity or sorrow for Count Dracula, then this would be it. Dracula, after all, was a man driven by love--a deep fathomless love that caused him to renounce the Church and live eternally in order to avenge the loss of his love.<br/><br/>I guess we can all take a lesson on true love from Dracula? I don't know. I think it went past love and entered the boundaries of worship. He worshipped his lost wife and had a chance to worship her again when a woman named Mina (Winona Ryder) appeared in the likeness of his dead wife 400 years later. The only problem is that Mina was to be betrothed to Jonathan (Keanu Reeves). But that should be no problem for a Count... right?"

Its unlike any other film and although it can feel a bit much at times. Its ambitious and creative nature deserves to be commended.

","First, costumes and atmosphere, compete side by side with Gary Oldman as the stunning and moving stars of this Coppola film. Maybe Coppola had been sampling too much of his wine, but this film, while staying true to the original source material in some key ways - like Gary Oldman also serving as the coachman of the carriage which picks up Jonathan Harker at the Borgo Pass, the dark period of Harker's imprisonment in the castle - it spins off in some wild moments of melodramatic silliness. One wonders at times if this film is supposed to be a homage in parody of the classic Hammer films which preceded it? Still, it is solely Oldman's superb performance which makes this film so watchable again and again. That and the lush production and scoring, gorgeous costuming and generally artful special effects (excepting the bizarre grafting together of two of Dracula's brides!). Sadly, though definitely easy on the eyes, Reeves and Rider both make one want to break out in giddy giggles at their over-wrought earnestness in trying to convey Victorian English people. Worst of all? The ridiculous vampire bat-wolf raping Lucy on a stone altar in the garden!!!"

Dracula travels to London to seduce Harker's fiancée Mina Murray(also played by Winona Ryder).<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is deliciously evil but Keanu Reeves is well overmatched by his acting counterpart. Winona Ryder is pretty but her role desperately need her sexuality. Director Francis Ford Coppola has created one of the most beautiful lavish Gothic film. It is erotic but it isn't sexy.<br/><br/>The movie looks amazing but it lacks the pace, the tension, and worst of all, it lacks the scares that a real Dracula horror should deliver. Coppola has built a beautiful piece of art, but not a great piece of story."
"ryansassy1","8","3","3","17 November 2012"," The vampire film for the Goth generation
","Francis Ford Coppola has crafted something visually stunning with his version of Dracula. It has held up beautifully for 20 years now. If you're one of the viewers who left the theater grumbling that the 1979 version with Frank Langella was better, then you're probably not of the target generation for this film.<br/><br/>This new take on the classic Dracula story by Bram Stoker is all MTV attitude where the '79 film was something your dad probably listened to back before they invented CDs. There is a wonderful sense of lushness and extravagance to the sets and the costumes. Coppola's eye for dramatic angles and tricks of lighting brings out the magic and the horror of each scene in equal measure.<br/><br/>Emotions are conveyed through a theatrical, exaggerated style of acting: weirdly, it works well even though in any other context you'd be cringing at the hamminess of it all. Gary Oldman as Count Dracula chews through the scenery in a brilliant rendition of a tortured soul who is also a merciless killer. Winona Ryder (whom I normally don't count among the serious actors) does the role of Mina justice: proper Victorian maiden, innocent but drawn to the seductive side of darkness. Keanu Reeves' Jonathan Harker is widely criticized as a dull and wooden character, but serves as a good contrast to his rival the Count. And so we have set up an intense love triangle which draws out the tension effectively.<br/><br/>The horrific nature of this tale (ancient vampire from Transylvania crosses the Atlantic ocean to begin a reign of terror in 19th Century England)is not neglected by any means. Violence as well as the more subtle psychological thrills and creeps are in abundance here. Coppola's vampires come in many incarnations, but they are all decadent monsters of the night whose top predatory skill are seduction.<br/><br/>So then let yourself be seduced! Delicious thrills await you. Plentiful angst pours out of the dialog in torrents. Coppola is the master of dramatic emotionalism for those who enjoy this over-the-top style."
"tequila101","7","3","3","12 January 2012"," Lives up to the Original Well, Accept a Few Problems
","Bram Stoker's Dracula from 1992, a remake of the original from 1931 wasn't a bad remake and ended up been quite faithful to what I liked about the original. Before I get on with the review I will say this: I have never been a massive fan of any Dracula films but I do like the original and this film for what they were. I also think that even if this remake was a nice blend and touch to the original, it was still not what I had expected. The other thing I'll say is that I didn't have many problems, and I did like this version from 1992.<br/><br/>Dracula 1992 basically follows along the same lines as the original plot. A man is near getting married but he is called on to go to Transivania and he meets an unknown fiend named Coutn Dracula who loves blood. When Dracula gets to this man, he pursues in going to London and wishing his soon be wife away with him. A lot of trouble brews throughout England as people get hurt, Dracula gets a new look and a vampire killer/slayer named Van Helsing is on the catch to get him.<br/><br/>The story is all round the same but there are two major differences that I found with this film: The overall atmosphere and feel of this film was really different. They took it to a whole new level as they got well known actors (being Gary Oldman playing Dracula and Anythony Hopkins as the Vampire Slayer), the music was full of dread, costumes and make up was also quite up to date style and the film followed the lines of Gothic and old times (obviously as this film is set in the 18th century). The remake (like the Halloween Remake) was much more longer than the original film itself giving us more detail, back story, and a lot of story.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman was an excellent choice as Dracula. He made this role really creepy, dreadful, loving, romantic-like, soothing but also Gothic. I also loved how they kept the contents of how the vampire(s) must be killed and I liked in general what they did with Dracula's character here. They gave him a lot to do in this film e.g. (his over shadow moving in a direction that he wasn't, the way he can change from a cold blooded creature into a handsome young devil. Anthony Hopkins also did a top notch job on his role and he really bumped the film to it's peak. The other actors were good as well.<br/><br/>The film does suffer with a few problems. They give us a lot of scenes of things happening to people and then the scenes has a black out and we end up seeing that the person is alive or un hurt. I don't know what the director was trying to achieve with some of those weird scenes that I did not understand. It was a little hard to understand what he was trying to get at. But most of the time I got what he was trying to do. It was just the little scenes that I think could have been better.<br/><br/>Overall this remake is quite a faithful remake to the original. If you have seen the original 1931 film but not this. Watch this with an open mind as it is a really good remake. Not the best and it wouldn't rank up with other modern horror remakes such as Dawn of the Dead but it's still good. I just found that it was a totally different film, but worked on it's own well.<br/><br/>Not as good as the 1931 version but I still like it and give it the same score as the 1931 film. 7.5/10"
"lucasblows","1","60","114","5 May 2001"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen
","I was excited when I saw the previews for ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".  It was expressly marketed as the first movie to tell the story the way Bram Stoker wrote it.  <br/><br/>Nothing could be further from the truth.  <br/><br/>Calling it ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is an insult to the author of this classic tale.  It's not just that it doesn't compare to the book.  That rarely happens with any screen adaptation of a great novel.  However, Coppola completely changed massive amounts of important aspects of the story.  I find it amusing that after going on and on about how it was going to adhere so strictly to the original story, they had to release a new novel of Coppola's version so people would ""get it"".<br/><br/>Most of the acting is terrible throughout.  The nature of characters are completely different from Stoker's (most notably Van Helsing, Mina, and Lucy).  The love story added in is lame (at one point reminiscent of a Monty Python skit), and some of the ""imagery"" is cheesy.  There were some decent effects, though, which made about 1% of the movie interesting.  Some of the costumes aren't bad, others aren't good.<br/><br/>After seeing an interview with Coppola, one really gets the sense that he believes this is the way the story ""should have"" or ""would have"" been told had Stoker been allowed to write openly about certain topics.  That is, however, utter nonsense and arrogance.<br/><br/>Coppola has made some astounding films, but this ain't one of them.  It's amongst the worst movies I've ever seen."
"minos_","10","8","11","13 January 2017"," The essence of vampires: Alien, erotic and enchanting.
","I never was a big fan of vampires, yet one day decided to watch Coppola's take on Dracula. <br/><br/>The opening sequence was all it took to convince me. Loud and intense, with visuals so breathtaking and stylish, it left me staring at the screen with my jaw on the floor. I knew i was in for a ride, and the rest of this two hour masterpiece utterly confirmed that. <br/><br/>Coppola sucks you into an entirely convincing, dark world with his feverish editing, impressive sets, outstanding costumes, brilliant special effects and the greatest Dracula put on film: Gary Oldman. <br/><br/>Oldman's Dracula appears in many different shapes throughout the movie, and he differentiates them brilliantly. Yet, the scenes to burn themselves into your mind will be those of the first act. A legendary outfit (and hairdo!), Coppola's brilliantly creepy shadows and alien moves that would make even Sigourney Weaver shriek in fear make this the most haunting imagery of Dracula yet.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, Coppola adds one more secret sauce to this movie, one that elevates the image of vampires from creepy monsters to darkest fantasy: Sex. <br/><br/>In fact, this might just be the most erotic movie you'll ever see. No character is safe from the dark lust Dracula inflicts them with: not even the Count himself. Some scenes might outright shock you in how blatantly they display the unstoppable desire for sex that the characters display. From the first innocent chuckling at pornographic drawings in a book, to a half-naked maiden gone mad with lust, Coppola's Dracula is in control more than anything else because of his erotic aura that redefines how we perceive the vampire myth.<br/><br/>The tag line for this movie states ""Love never dies"". Indeed, this story is a tragic romance underneath it all. If you can embrace this reinterpretation of the original story, it all concludes so wonderfully, the story of Dracula becomes much more coherent. It makes sense. <br/><br/>In short, this is the greatest depiction of vampires ever put to film. A visual delight, with technical excellence displayed by director, costumers and a brilliant Gary Oldman. A feverish, sexual depiction that will leave drops of sweat on your forehead. An interpretation of Dracula that does not stray far, but makes the viewer understand the shadowy figure better than any attempt has before or after. <br/><br/>A masterpiece and the essential Dracula put on film."

","The movie starts off with a couple scenes that are too artsy so they seem cheesy but as the movie progresses it gets much better. There is some amazingly shot scenes and the actors (except Keanu Reeves who's accent isn't believable) do an incredable job portraying the characters. Gary Oldman should have won an Academy Award for his acting and if not him it should have gone to Anthony Hopkins who plays three roles. This movie only got 7.1 (when i wrote this review) but it deserves a 8.5 at least. It is one of my ten favourite movies of all time. The only reason I think anyone has to complain is if they were huge fans of the book and thought that the movie wasn't up to par but even The Lord Of The Rings has that problem."

"Kingkitsch","1","34","61","8 August 2014"," Worse than you remember
","I saw this atrocious version of ""Dracula"" when it was first released in 1992. I tried to forget about it immediately, but twenty-two years later, I found a used DVD of it at a thrift store (cost: fifty cents) and attempted to try a second time to understand why so many people thought this was the ""best Dracula ever!!!"" (see dozens of rapturous ten star reviews here on IMDb) In truth, this movie is still atrocious.<br/><br/>So. It has been thoroughly established that the title is erroneous. Oh, there's about 25% of Bram Stoker in this pile of vampire guano, but the rest is Coppola's psychedelic interpretation. Coppola seemed determined to make a mom-porn sexy version of the famous novel, so much so that it's a mystery why he didn't cast Fabio in the title role instead of the scenery-chewing Gary Oldman. The screenwriter must have moonlighted for Harlequin Romance novels. For the reported forty million dollars the film cost to make, it looks cheap and shoddy. Painfully obvious models are used for the Westenra estate, the Carfax Abbey sets look borrowed from TV's ""Dark Shadows"", and let's try to forget again about the model train chugging into Transylvania. The entire exercise feels claustrophobic. Oh yeah, the not so special effects need a mention here as well. Coppola's smug telling of the story includes the ""blue flames"", seen here as coruscating rings of fire that look like superimposed images from the top of someone's gas range. No explanation for this is given, but in the novel, the coachman (who is Dracula) stops the coach to follow the flames, telling Harker that the blue fire indicates buried treasure. Coppola probably sat back, lit a cigar and felt really literary about including this small bit from the novel, while completely screwing up pretty much everything else. <br/><br/>The much-touted makeup and costumes are so over-the-top and ridiculous it's amazing the actors wore them without laughing. Of special note is the whatever the hell dress Sadie Frost has to wear, the white lace thing with an Elizabethan neck ruff that needs it's own zip code. Miss Frost looks like her head has been detached and placed on a really large doily. Dracula's muscle-system striated armor is plastic, and it shows. Kudos to whoever convinced Coppola that Dracula wandered around his castle in a hostess gown and wore his hair in double-hump albino beehives. The Prince of Darkness is now the Queen of Transylvania. Even Liberace would have had trouble managing this look. You're in trouble when the most remembered thing about your movie is a very bad wig. Etc.<br/><br/>The actors are pretty much embarrassing, only a few escape unscathed. Oldman overplays, Ryder has the appeal of wet cheesecloth, Frost seems to think she's in a soft-core cable porn epic, Waits should have turned this down, Sir Anthony must have need the check, and then there's like, whoa!, Keanu. Wonder if he took this off his resume, if not, he should.<br/><br/>In review, this trashy version of one of the world's great Gothic tales is worse than you remember. It's not faithful enough to the source material, it's not campy enough to be a cult movie, and it's full of shoplifted touches from other, better vampire films. One of these larcenous bits is Dracula's independently moving shadow. While this does not appear in the novel, it was used first in Murnau's 1922 ""Nosferatu"", especially the ""long distance"" shadow that attends Lucy's party. In 1932, Carl Dreyer used the independent shadow in his ""Vampyr"" to portray the power the vampire had over it's victims.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll be watching this in 2036, because I gave the DVD back to the thrift store with some old clothes. Hopefully they'll be able to make another fifty cents off it."

Did anyone pay attention to how badly all those talented actors acted in this film? Hopkins' adaptation to the Van Helsing accent was ridiculous and annoying, Ryder's acting was melodramatic and unconvincing, and Gary Oldman- well he is simply in love with himself. But it's without a doubt that it was in fact Keanu Reeves who kept amazing me. And it's not as if I thought he was great in other films, but in this one it was absurd, and on the verge of parody; the way he looks when he enters Mina's room with his friends to meet the count- his scattered look, compulsive blinking, lack of any emotion what so ever- just gave me the general feeling that Keanu momentarily forgot in which movie he was playing and what was expected from him. Not to mention that hideous fake British accent, and the robotic style Reeves used to convey us he is 'in the character'. As a comedy- yes, this movie was brilliant. As a horror drama- PE-LEEEASE. It is crystal clear Coppola mis-casted and mis-directed this farce. Horror show all right And a tip to those who have the DVD- don't forget to watch the hilarious documentary, with brilliant shots of I-don't-know-what-I'm-doing-here-Reeves (""Dude, there's something soo weird with being bitten in the neck""), I-am-so-in-love-with-myself Oldman, and much much more.

"neil-476","7","9","13","22 November 2012"," An interesting take
","Dracula is a bit like Batman - the original creation has been filtered through so many different creative viewpoints over the years that it must now be accepted that the character is capable of multiple interpretations. Francis Ford Coppola chose to interpret Dracula, not as a murderous bloodstained monster, but as a tragic romantic hero. Personally, I have a bit of trouble with that particular take on Dracula, but I don't have any problem with accepting it as a valid creative option.<br/><br/>Coppola's film is lushly gorgeous - sensual, sexual, with rich colours hidden in the looming shadows, and oily, serpentine, unnatural movements all adding to a sense of unease. Winona Rider does quite well as Mina - here portrayed as a virtual reincarnation of Dracula's tragic lost wife - and the cast of helpers are all quite good: even Keanu Reeves customary stoic (read ""woodon"") persona quite suits Jonathan Harker. Hopkins has great fun chewing some scenery, not too excessively, and Gary Oldman gets deep inside a very mannered portrayal of Dracula. Perhaps too mannered, some might say, but there is no question as to the quality of the performance.<br/><br/>All things considered, though, Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula isn't my Dracula at all."

The filming and score are superb. However In my opinion some of the gross sexual parts of the film could have very well not been put in as it subtracts from the beauty and quality of the story. Leaving you with a B grade horror movie feeling. Winona Ryder was wonderful as always with her performance as the innocent, modest, Beautiful, Mina. All other performances done well.

For the sake of those who may, to my dismay, desire to watch this movie I will not go into any great detail. However, turning each character into someone else on almost every occasion, as well as making some of them (perhaps unintentionally) sickly comedic was almost too much for me.

I was incredibly surprised by the power and wonder it held, as well as being extremely well written. I was very eager to watch this movie due to the fact that people have gone on and on about how it is the most faithful adaptation. I suppose if you compare it to the other movies which bear the name Dracula but have no resemblance, with the exception of a Romanian accent and blood sucking, that statement would be true, if not wildly inaccurate.

To be honest - I had seen it shortly after it came out and it left a mixed feeling. Now I wanted to see it again to get a second chance of building an opinion... but... I didn't make it. I couldn't stand watching this movie all the way through. Normally I don't comment movies I haven't seen all the way through, but this time I felt I had to say what I think anyway.<br/><br/>I couldn't connect to the movie at all. The performances in general sucked big time, there was no real feeling - it felt more like a circus with a several hour long and chaotic number with 399 overly colourful, completely (raving mad) shrieking, crying and shouting clowns! This film left me dizzy and my brain was spinning out of control. <br/><br/>TERRIBLE! YUK!!!! 1/10"
"oopfrank","1","25","47","27 June 2000"," Creators of this film must have never read the book...
","Having just finished reading Dracula, I was quite excited to see this film. After all, the movie includes the author's name so it must be true to the book, right?  Wrong.  The initial scene is false and far too silly.  The evil ""mysticism"" of the book was far more subtle and, IMO, frightening than the boorish, bloody behavior of this introductory scene.  Fine, whatever, bad first scene intended to draw in the usual horror fans.  I can live with one bad introductory scene.<br/><br/>However, things did not improve.  Renfield was a joke.  Dracula hardly behaved as Dracula did in the book (suave, cool, well spoken), and Lucy was just plain ludicrous.  Add (subtract?) the painful acting of Keanu Reaves and his british accent and you end up with an unbearable movie.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to *mention* Winona Ryder as Mina Harker...the mind boggles.<br/><br/>One final thing, though...what was with the shadows? Pfft."
"UnderworldRocks","1","16","28","10 January 2014"," Chicken ribs...
","I would give a minus 10 if I could.<br/><br/>Something about Dracula (1992) has always been rather confusing to me, because it has been regarded by some as the most artistic vampire film, which is incomprehensible. It is ABSOLUTELY NOT a classic, and ""chicken ribs"" is more like it. (""Chicken ribs"" is an expression in Chinese that describes something of little value and taste. I don't know about other languages.) <br/><br/>Let's just forget about whether it is faithful to the original novel, and regard it as a standalone film.<br/><br/>Look! Lucy's bloody head is flying in midair in slow-mo, in a second the picture is cut to the scene where Hopkins the Van Helsing is gorging on a gigantic pile of bloody repulsive pork or whatever. It can be certain that he hasn't indulged himself like that for a very long time.<br/><br/>The same with Dracula! In broad daylight, on the streets of London, he is hooking up with Mina. Then the pair is dating each other in a warm-hued restaurant. Mina starts to have illusions of her ""before-life"". Whether this is because she is high on absinthe, or horny before marriage (with Jonathan), or influenced by the magic powers of Dracula, remains unclear. Then, Mina is rapidly in love with her ""Prince"". And later on, Dracula reveals his true identity to Mina, and Mina madly expresses her love, ""Take me Love what you love, see what you see"" She is really godly fast even when she's got a fiancé already Surely Bram Stoker never saw that coming.<br/><br/>At the moment of realizing the opponent is Dracula, Hopkins the Van Helsing bursts into a horrific laughter---He's a sage? He's a psycho?---After all, this old prick is the ultimate BOSS, and Dracula is doomed to become a tragic clown.<br/><br/>Under the influence of Dracula Mina gets ""deviant"", and on the night of Hopkins the Van Helsing's company, she says, ""I know the lust of men,"" before Van Helsing gets horny too and enters Mina's bosom. Mina suddenly says, ""You bastard. You want to drive a stake through my heart like you did to poor Lucy?"" and tries to attack the old punk before getting subdued by his little crucifix. This scene is ""epic"" whether it aims to express that Dracula's magic is potent, or that Van Helsing is full of lust.<br/><br/>Later, out of the blue, Hopkins the Van Helsing finds the dormitory of the three vamps, cuts off their heads, throws them down the cliff while screaming: ""Dracu----------------------------------!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Suffice it to say, this scene shows that Mr. Van is ""intelligent"" & ""peaceful"", a ""sage""! <br/><br/>Hollywood is no stranger to car chasing scenes, and there is also one in this film: Dracula takes a ride home, and the other main cast rides and pursues. Dracula sticks his head out of soil, looking dirty and ugly.<br/><br/>The fight sequence near the ending is very short. Dracula, his face looking like a gorilla's, for an instant appears super ass-kicking, before getting kicked in the ass. Supported by his mistress Mina, he staggers into his living room. A stake through the heart, off with his head! Blah-blah-blahthen his spirit is free! Thus the holy music gets defiled as the film closes <br/><br/>A recap: vampire Dracula has an overseas trip, tries to possess other people's wife who looks like his own who died 400 years ago, murders an ""innocent"" girl Lucy in the process, and then on the way back gets kicked in the ass and then eats the dust.<br/><br/>""Love Never Dies"" is printed on the poster. Looks like the director tries hard to show the theme of true love's immortality of a vampire, Ah! But true love! Whither art thou! <br/><br/>On one hand, it tries to impress the audience with a love story; on the other hand, it tries to depict the darkness and horror of vampire. How difficult it is for the director to do both! <br/><br/>PS: Jonathan explores the castle and encounters the three vamps who dress in a rather nude fashion, who calls to him, ""Come hereLie down"" (And he listens and obeys! He's also a prick!) The shot of Jonathan screaming to the point of faintness upon watching the vamps eating a baby is absolutely fantastic! Astonishingly beautiful! The actor Keanu Reeves truly shows Jonathan's fear. However, if the picture of his screaming face is noted with ""When Neo meets Smith"", it can be in a nice parody of The Matrix! <br/><br/>The film ""Dracula: Dead and Loving it"" seems ""vulgar"", and the story is told in a very humorous way that is mockingly funny and lovely, bringing smiles to people's faces.<br/><br/>By contrast, Dracula (1992) consciously seems to define itself as a classic magnificent masterpiece, and ends up being a big poser."

","-------Dracula.-------<br/><br/>A 9.6 but not a 10++.<br/><br/>I am giving ten well deserved stars to this version of Dracula as it is without any doubt the best adaptation of the Abraham (Bram) Stoker´s book to the big screen. Nonetheless, it´s a 9.5 or 9.6 star movie that become ten when you round and not a 10+ or 10++ because if this movie has any defect at all is that in the moments when Dracula does not appear, the tension falls dramatically, which is also applicable to some moments when Dracula appears in his human form during daytime; and it is actually a defect that it maybe shares with the book it came from. Nevertheless, I think that this wasn´t necessarily a defect 100 and something years ago when Stoker wrote his novel, as life was slower in those days and there was no TV, movies or internet. Actually if you ever read the first chapter of the original Bram Stoker´s Dracula, you will be amazed how in some few pages, the author teaches you a little bit of many things at the same time that he tells you the first part of the story. He teaches you a little bit of gastronomy, a little bit of geography, a little bit of mythology and even a little bit of German and other languages. Nonetheless, when the story advances you keep wanting less details and more action.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thanks for reading.<br/><br/>IMDb Review written by David del Real.<br/><br/>2018."

","Bram Stoker must be turning over in his grave. This horrifically inept adaptation of the famous novel earns the distinction of being the worst movie ever made by an Oscar-winning director. It is hard to believe that the man who gave us ""The Godfather"" is responsible for this travesty. Although the title suggests a faithfulness to the novel, the film takes liberties and none for the better. Although the cinematography is beautiful and there is a fine score, the plot is incoherent and quite tedious.

","Before ploughing into what's so very wrong about this film certain points of near brilliance have to be mentioned.<br/><br/>The costume design (though frequently historically inaccurate) is amazing.<br/><br/>There are several sequences (particularly the shadow of The Count menacing Harker) which are so good they really should be lifted and placed in a much better film than this one.<br/><br/>And the score is exceptional.<br/><br/>But everything else needs to tucked away in the sort of concrete bunker that nuclear waste is deposited into.<br/><br/>For a film that has the nerve to call itself Bram Stoker's Dracula, it is less true to that, so film-able but alas yet to be faithfully adapted, novel as many of the films it apparently is trying to distance itself from.<br/><br/>The 'love story' element particularly, is a very wonky add on pinched off and done better in the Jack Palance version.<br/><br/>The accents of Reeves and Ryder are shockingly awful.<br/><br/>The film seems to have been edited to deliberately remove all suspense and narrative flow from the story.<br/><br/>The most cinematic moments of the book (The Demeter Crossing, Lucy's first sighting of the Count, the death of Lucy's mother, Lucy escaping Van Helsing etc as mist, the fight between Reinfield and the Count, the tracking down of the Counts coffins) All lost or skipped over to make way for Mina's trysts with Prince Vlad.<br/><br/>Where's the Golden Krone segment? <br/><br/>And since when has Whitby been a suburb of London?<br/><br/>Lucy herself is turned from being the pretty, but silly thing of the novel (who becomes shockingly sensual as a vampire) into a naughty little strumpet who giggles at Victporniana, says smutty lines which would have made the Carry On team blush (and would have got Lucy sent off to Doctor Jack's Asylum in period the story is set) and even snogging Mina in a little lesbian cut away.<br/><br/>Mina (a intelligent modern woman in the novel) played by Ryder channelling the ghost of Princess Diana. Is more wet than a cod-lings swimming costume. Yet still manages to get away with,walking with a stranger, watching an early porn movie (before they were invented) with a stranger and taking drugs with a stranger, activities which wouldn't be tolerated in that time period.<br/><br/>The scene where she drinks the Count's blood (which played as an oral rape scene in the novel and a demonstration of Dracula's ability to completely overpower her protectors) in this film plays as a tacky seduction... The Count is almost the victim here of Mina's lusts.<br/><br/>Van Helsing ala Hopkins is a truly bizarre creation. (surely he should have been cast as the Count not Oldman) Oldman is the saddest waste of this film. At turns camp as Christmas and then truly moving, and then barmy shouty and impossible to hear.<br/><br/>Only Dr Seward and Quincey Morris are close to their book counterparts.<br/><br/>How this film got released at all is a mystery.<br/><br/>Why it's still regarded so well beggars belief.<br/><br/>I still hope that one day someone will go back to the novel and make a film that translates it faithfully, with a cast and performances that match it's near perfection."
"maggiemaexo","7","4","5","25 October 2012"," Not a scary evil vampire movie... but a good Gothic horror romance
","In 1897, newly-qualified solicitor Jonathan Harker takes the Transylvanian Count Dracula as a client from his colleague R. M. Renfield, who has gone insane. Jonathan travels to Transylvania to arrange Dracula's real estate acquisition in London, including Carfax Abbey. Jonathan meets Dracula, who discovers a picture of Harker's fiancée, Mina, and believes that she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta, his long lost love. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be seduced by his brides and sails to England with boxes of his native soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey. In London, Dracula appearing young and handsome during daylight, meets and charms Mina. When Mina receives word from Jonathan, who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent, she travels to Romania to marry him. In his fury, Dracula transforms Lucy, her best friend, into a vampire. The men: Van Helsing, Holmwood, Seward and Morris kill Lucy. After Jonathan and Mina return to London, Jonathan and Van Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey, where they destroy the Count's boxes of soil. Dracula confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina's friends, but a confused and angry Mina admits that she still loves him and remembers her previous life as Elisabeta. At her insistence, Dracula begins transforming her into a vampire. The men are now determined to save her before her transformation is complete by killing Dracula.<br/><br/>What makes this film so special compared to other Dracula movies? I think it was Gary Oldman's performance; he made a very memorable Dracula. Ranging from creepy and disturbing to romantic and charming. I think a lot of people connected with the love story, even if it was over romanticized. The settings of this great story is late 19th century Europe (England and Karpathia). Karpathia is not well known to man, the wild side of Europe. All this bears with it the mysticism of this story and the epic and tragic background. rich colors in the scenery and costumes really bring the goth out of the film. Meanwhile Coppola works well with shadows and images in the backgrounds to make the film have the feel of an old silent movie version (eyes in the storm) but with modern standards. It's not really scary, but I didn't need it to be<br/><br/>As Van Helsing, Anthony Hopkins puts his personal stamp on a well known character as well. His portrayal of the famous professor is zealous and lively, and touched with an eccentricity that makes him an interesting and welcome presence in the film. Winona Ryder, too, gives a believable performance as Mina, a somewhat emotionally challenging role she addresses with the restraint demanded of her by the character. With her dark, winsome looks and natural intensity she is perfect for the part, and displays a femininity that contrasts well with the overt sexuality of Dracula's three 'brides.' And Tom Waits gives a memorable performance as the mad, insect-eater, Renfield, as does Sadie Frost, as Lucy, Mina's young and nubile best friend who unwittingly falls prey to Dracula's dark powers. The single member of the cast who seems to struggle a bit with characterization is Keanu Reeves, as Jonathan Harker; he gives a passable performance, but fails to ever get a firm grasp of the character. Still, he has an engaging presence and, though lacking depth, his portrayal is at least credible enough to maintain the continuity of the film.<br/><br/>Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the movie is a grand experience in movie making. Everyone should go out and rent it, but don't expect to see a horror movie about an evil vampire, but a tragic love story about a cursed prince and his reincarnated princess falling in love during a very dark and horrifying time."
"dunmore_ego","7","4","5","16 August 2011"," Delicious, with a hint of sour Keanu.
","In BRAM STOKER'S Dracula, Gary Oldman shows us what acting IS and Keanu Reeves shows us what acting ISN'T.<br/><br/>We all know the concept of Dracula; it is in our - ahem - bloodstreams, but in cinema, we rarely see Dracula's origins. Director Francis Ford Coppolla opens the movie with the event that made warrior Vlad the Impaler/Count Dracule the blood-drinking psychopath he would become.<br/><br/>In 1492, Count Dracule's wife (Winona Ryder), believing him to be dead in the Turkish wars, commits suicide. The Bishop pronounces her soul damned. Upon his return, Dracule (Oldman) renounces God and stabs a holy statue with his sword. Apparently, all you need to retrieve that elusive blood-from-a-stone is to stab it, for it gushes blood - which Dracule drinks lustily, then swears an oath that with all the powers of darkness he will return from the dead to avenge his wife. (Can't figure who he wants revenge on, since she took her own life.) Which is also educative, as we see how easy it is to come back from the dead: if you vow something supernatural with a Gary Oldman level of psychodrama - it's gonna happen! <br/><br/>Suddenly - Keanu, as Jonathan Harker. (Uh, what's with the accent?) In ""modern times"" - 1800's England - we meet the peripheral hero of Stoker's novel embodied in Theodore Logan Esquire, play-acting in a posh accent like he's attending a little girl's tea party for dolls.<br/><br/>He leaves his virginal lover, Mina (Winona Ryder in another role, different dress) and travels to Transylvania to meet The Count (Gary Oldman in the same role, different dress) to strike a real estate deal for property in England. The Count is deliciously cordial and ominous at the same time, his shadow moving independently of his actions.<br/><br/>He sees a picture of Mina that Harker carries and is besot with remembered love, ageless as oceans. He believes Mina is the incarnation of his lost wife and sets his black soul on reclaiming her. (This ""eternal love"" aspect was inserted into Stoker's story, for the better I believe, as it adds depth to the tragic hero). <br/><br/>After entrapping Harker in his castle (at the mercy of his three vampiric wives), The Count journeys to England to seek out Mina and cause havoc with his drinking of blood, sleeping in coffins and out-acting everyone with one wing tied behind his back.<br/><br/>In London, while Renfield (Tom Waits) heralds Dracula's glory from within the walls of a sanitarium, Mina playfully frolics with her best friend Lucy (Sadie Frost), unaware that plans are afoot to taint Lucy's blood with disease, whilst destroying her virginity and independent thought - yes, marriage. The three men courting the libertine Lucy are Cary Elwes, Richard E. Grant and Bill Campbell. When Lucy becomes deathly pale and blood-sick long before any of the men put their tallywackers inside her, it is suspected that only a superstitious old curmudgeon can diagnose her disease, so of course they call in Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins).<br/><br/>Van Helsing is also a vampire expert and realizes that the man-sized wolf prowling the property, the intermittent liquid nitrogen fog and the BITE-MARKS ON LUCY'S NECK means only one thing: there's someone on set who is overacting even more than him...<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the production, Coppolla did opt to go a little cheap, shooting everything on stage sets, and though the indoor sets are as lush as blood-drenched wine, the medieval cello theme lending acres of trepidation to the shadowy palette, the fake outdoor sets are quite distracting.<br/><br/>Oldman sells not only the horror that his bat man brings, but the tragedy of his own immortality and love lost. When he tracks down Mina amidst a throng of cityfolk, it is as if they are the only two people on the street, as he tells her, ""I have crossed oceans of time to find you."" <br/><br/>Beyond the tactile horror of blood-drinking and stake-thumping, this Dracula is a romantic tragedy, which is not the norm with Dracula stories. Only Oldman could sell it this way. And sell it he does, in every incarnation of The Count: from his warrior Vlad the Impaler, to the Continental Count with the big hair; he sells it as the uber-romantic tousle-locked Euro bounder, and as the knuckle-twisted, fur-covered man bat.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman's thespian talents are on such display in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula that it is simply unfair to dismiss these roles as cheesy overacting, because though he does camp it overboard, his emotional spectrum runs deeper than the worm-infested soil he snuggles in at moonset. He is, so to speak, the hammer behind the nails in the coffin.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is immortal."
"matheusmarchetti","10","4","5","4 August 2007"," Bram Stoker's classic
","Francis Ford Coppola brings to the screen what is to me THE best film adaptations of the classic novel ever filmed to date. It's well paced, well directed, very atmopsheric and haunting, it's very creepy too. The look of the film is jaw-dropping, combining German expressionism with vivid colors and strange visuals very reminiscent of Argento's Suspiria. Gary Oldman does a great job as the title character, who lives on it's very own, with the scariness of Max Schrek with the subtle seductiveness of Frank Langella. Winona Ryder does a beautiful and convincing portrayal of Mina Murray. Anthony Hopkings is great as Van Helsing, who, whilst stays true to the original, has some Hannibal Lector vibes to him. The only miscast is Keanu Reeves. He really sucks in the role of Jonathan Harker, and was so terribly miscast. It's probably the only thing that really bothered me about the film. The romantic twist in the story is very nice and it's not corny as it may sound, but the film would have worked just as well without it, but still and highly recommended."

"preppy-3","1","16","29","29 July 2005"," Probably the worst Dracula ever
","Dracula (Gary Oldman) attacks London.<br/><br/>OK-there are so many things wrong with this film it's hard to know where to start. First off--the title. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". Oh really? I've read the book multiple times--this is NOT the book at all. Just the opening with how Dracula became wasn't from the book at all. It gets worse when they switch to 1897 London...and you see Jonathan Harker is played by Keanu Reeves! We all know Reeves can't act but seeing him trying to imitate an English accent was just jaw-dropping. He was TERRIBLE! He goes to Dracula's castle to help him move to London. There we met Oldman in terrible makeup giving one of his worst performances. He also seems to be wearing Japanese robes (for some reason). And he looks ugly--Dracula is supposed to be handsome. Also the shadows in the castle don't move with the people (???). It all leads to a stupid scene full of pointless female nudity where three female vampires attack Reeves. Reeves pretty much disappears after that (this is a good thing).<br/><br/>We cut to London--Dracula comes aboard. Mina (Winona Ryder) is watching for Jonathan, her boyfriend. With her is her good friend Lucy (Sadie Frost). She behaves like a nymphomaniac--not in the book. Also there's a huge rainstorm when Mina and Lucy run around giggling and end up kissing. WHY? It leads to nothing and isn't in the book either. Then Dracula shows up, turns into a wolf man (???), lures Lucy out of her bed and rapes her (????) on top of a tombstone. Bites her too. Then Mina shows up and she is (sigh) the reincarnation of Dracula's dead wife. OK--that is the oldest, stupidest cliché in horror films and, again, not in the book.<br/><br/>Lucy starts to slowly die--poor Frost has to wither around in bed with her breasts constantly being exposed. Her boyfriend (Cary Elwes) and suitors stand around and watch--they're given nothing to do. Also Dr. Seward (Richard E. Grant) pops up too and--for no reason--he's shown as a drug addict. Why? Again--not in the book. Then Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is called in. He realizes what's happening. Lucy dies (after being raped by a wolf) and returns as a vampire (one of the few effective sequences). Of course she vomits blood on Van Helsing--for no reason other than to gross out the audience. She's killed (again) and Dracula starts romancing Mina in some truly boring sequences that drag on forever.<br/><br/>It all leads up with the guys trying to get Dracula away from Mina and kill him. And the very end is (again) changed completely.<br/><br/>OK--let's deal with the acting. Oldman--just dreadful. He's a good actor but not here. Let's put it this way--when somebody mentions cinematic Dracula do you think of Oldman? Ryder was actually very good but, purportedly, her and Oldman hated each other--it comes through loud and clear. Poor Frost is forced to be topless a lot and act sex-starved--she DOES pull it off however. Reeves--just the worst here--and that's saying a lot. Hopkins--what the HELL was he playing? He's acting like he's in a comedy--not a horror movie. Elwes and Campbell are given nothing to do. Grant is just OVER OVER the top (and annoying). Tom Waits is forgettable as Reinfield.<br/><br/>The movie is chockful of visual tricks and stunning color--but it did nothing for me. It was nonstop and I got the impression that director Francis Ford Coppola was just showing off. Also it got tremendously annoying--I almost turned it off a few times. The special effects ARE good however (except for the stupid green mist that seduces Mina--don't ask). Also the music score is loud and overbearing. And what was with the costumes? An Asian man did them and Dracula seems dressed as he just popped in from China! Perhaps the gentleman should have been told Dracula is from Transylvania NOT China. I don't blame him though--Coppola probably told him to do that to add more color to the film.<br/><br/>The script was hopeless--constantly straying from the novel. The title should be ""Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula"" or ""James Harts' Dracula"" (he was the screenwriter). Also--it wasn't scary at all. Not even a little (but Frost ALMOST makes it work in her vampire getup). My main problem is this tripe about Mina being Dracula's long-lost love (or something). Crap like that was clichéd back in the 1940s--it's almost insulting that this was stuck into a 1990s movie.<br/><br/>This was a huge hit in 1992 (most likely cause it was advertised nonstop and Coppola did it) but now it's, rightfully, almost forgotten. A textbook example of how NOT to do a vampire film. I can't stress enough how horrible this truly is. A 1."
"ShadowsBeneathTheLight","1","18","34","30 August 2014"," Blasphemy to Bram Stoker and the Victorian Era
","I will say that this does follow the general plot of the novel more so than other Dracula movies, however in its attempt to capture a more modern audience, the movie to much from the authenticity and cultural significance of Stoker's novel. By this, I am largely criticizing the movie's over eroticism of every single woman met. The Victorian Era, as with Gothic literature, was a time when a woman's purity was highly valued and symbolized her holiness and overall good. In fact the concept a pure woman is a reoccurring theme throughout Stoker's novel and symbolizes her righteousness in God's eyes. However when a woman is infected from the vampire curse, she very quickly begins to become more promiscuous and appears lustful among other behaviors strange to her norm. However in this movie, the women are over sexualized even when not infected with the vampire curse. For instance, a minor scene occurs when Lucy and Mina make out in the rain, something that would have never ever ever been allowed during the 19th century nor happened in the book even when the women are infected with the curse!!!! Almost every woman flashes her breasts at one point or another (except Ryder of course) which had this happened in the novel, Stoker's book would have been condemned as sully trash and burned on the spot. The most sexual thing that happens in the book is when the 3 vampire sisters encounter Harker during his stay at Castle Dracula and try to kiss his neck (to suck his blood mind you) and that is interrupted by Dracual and Harker is distraught with that being a form of adultery he contemplates noting the event less his fiancé read and get jealous. There certainly never was any attempted rape or bestiality as that would've forever caused Stoker's book to be banned along with his excommunication from the literary world. Additionally Lucy seems to flash her breasts at every instance no matter who is around just for the sake of the plot.<br/><br/>Beyond the erotisicm of the movie, there are vast differences from the book such as Mina spending a considerable amount of time with the count long before Harker returns. Furthermore there was no romantic relationship of any kind between Dracula and Mina as this would have sullied the whole point of her purity and Stoker's symbolism/theme. Harker was never the blood feasting slave of the 3 sisters. He merely encounters them three times for a total of like 5 seconds each. Additionally he escaped before Dracula left for England and left a scar on his forehead which allowed him to always recognize Dracula in human form. Throughout the novel, Dracula only pursues Lucy until her end. It is only then, a month afterwards that he sets his sights on Mina. When Lucy is infected, she tries to kiss Arthur her Fiancé not Quincy her failed suitor, and thanks Van Helsing for stopping her to spare Arthur of the curse. Dracula's origin is somewhat altered in the movie which to this day I have yet to see a movie mention Dracula studying black magic and alchemy at the Scholomance to become the ultimate warrior and being. Van Helsing has not been searching for Dracula nor is a vampire hunter but rather a practicer of both old and new medicine and remedies and keeps an open mind. He is a symbol for the theme of the dangers of abandoning the old ways for complete acceptance of the modern era/turn of the century. Rather Van Helsing is not only pure of heart and righteousness, but also a perfect balance of preserving the old world while adopting the ways of the new world. The more I watch this movie, the more differences I see. And yes I did say that this movie does the best at following the GENERAL plot of the movie throughout, but I must also say that I ultimately find more discrepancies between the novel and movie than similarities. <br/><br/>I think had this movie left off the name of Bram Stoker in the title, I would have been much more accepting of the movie. In that case I would have given this maybe a 7 or 8. The acting is OK, some actors are good, others...need a lot of work. Although not in the novel, I love what is done with the shadows to show Dracula's true nature. I also approve of the writer choosing to keep more memorable quotes from the novel to serve as dialogue in the movie, even if it is exchanged between the wrong characters or at the wrong times. I will say that I am appalled that Lucy the Vampire looks like Keira Knightley version of queen of Naboo from The Phantom Menace. But alas, I cannot forgive all the movie's blemishes and insults towards Stoker's original work. You call it Bram Stoker, I expect Bram Stoker, not 50 shades of Vampire. As I write this I have just finished today rereading the entire book and it sits on my lap just in case I need to double check that I am referencing the book appropriately. I suggest that to anyone who loves Dracula and Vampires who haven't read Stoker's novel should read it. It's the classic that really propelled vampires into popular horror (although not the earliest literary piece on vampires) and is what the modern vampire is based off. It's exactly 400 pages long and is a quick read. You won't be disappointed."
"itogtrader2","1","24","48","16 January 2009"," One of the worst movies ever made
","This is an exceptionally poor version of the undead but beloved vampire movie. Even though Bram Stoker's Dracula is not anywhere near as funny as the plethora of Dracula spoofs out there, the acting is just as bad if not worse. The special effects are not really that special either. Believe it or not, in this major studio motion picture, there is a scene in which a blatantly bad steam-engined model train is used to laughingly represent the chase where the hero 'Jonathan' (Keanu 'Ted' Reeves) tries to get to his love 'Mina' (Winona Ryder) back from 'Dracula' (Gary Oldman) who has whisked her away to his secret lair to be his love for all eternity after the mandatory neck bite and gory blood sucking. After some word bantering, posturing and comparisons of good and evil, he, of course, wins her back from Dracula and life and the undead, go on.<br/><br/>This film is a very very long, over-acted, badly written, poorly staged, tragically directed, overrated turd of a picture, that's only one redeeming quality is that most of the soundtrack is pretty quiet and it shouldn't keep you from getting a decently long nap during the showing. <br/><br/>You needn't bother to stay awake for this rehashing of the over thrashed Dracula myth unless you yourself are an undead ghoul with nothing better to do or a hard-core old Ann Rice fan (her new stuff is just to Catholicistic) with lots of time on your hands that just can't give up on the belief that you can't really call it necking unless you draw blood."

","This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies ever made. It would almost come off as a parody, except for the fact that it is vein-drainingly awful.<br/><br/>I actually remember rather liking this when I first saw it. This was before I read Stoker's book, but I still can't imagine how I could have actually liked this horrible, steaming, squirming pile of vampire guano.<br/><br/>There is literally nothing good about this film and if there is, it has been engulfed by the horrible murk that surrounds it. This movie is actually jaw-dropping in its sheer awfulness.<br/><br/>Every part has been miscast or misplayed and every scene seems artificial. Keanu Reeves is responsible for roughly 35% of the movie's suckage, but Winona Ryder carries some of the load there; at least 15%). Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins both suck as well, but their sucktitude is merely incidental; I'm not sure they make the movie any worse than it would have been with just Reeves and Ryder stinking up the joint. Either that or their contributions (maybe 5% each) are simply rendered obsolete by the suckescence of Reeves and Ryder. The other actors (Elwes, etc.) are just sort of...there. As for the cinematography, etc., blah. If you can't appreciate the story, who gives a turd about the scenery? Anyway, it looks fake.<br/><br/>All this suckage is without even touching upon the fact that it bears scant to the novel (the remaining 40%), which wouldn't be a problem, necessarily, if he hadn't attached Bram Stoker's name to the sucky thing. If you want to make a crappy movie that deviates drastically from the source novel, fine, go ahead; but don't attach the author's name to it. The very essence of the novel has changed in the film. Stoker's demonic Dracula has been morphed into some sort of lovesick and misunderstood hero. We go from wanting Dracula destroyed in the novel to (theoretically) sympathizing with him in the movie (along with suckerific lines like Hopkins' ""We have all become God's madmen. All of us"" *groan*). Seriously, WTH? I mean, it stops being Bram Stoker's Dracula right from the opening scene; no, scratch that, it stops being BRAM STOKER's Dracula with the freakin' movie poster (the very place it makes its outrageous claim). The tagline is ""Love Never Dies."" WTH has that to do with Bram Stoker's Dracula, I ask you? On a side note, I'm not sure where the prevalent stake-through-the-heart myth comes from but I don't recall seeing any mention of it in Stoker's book. A knife seemed to the trick just fine there."

Oh dear, oh dear! She was never in love with this monkey bat beast and was forced to drink Draculas Blood, she played a massive role in the book and really was the Heroine.

"pineapple_1013","5","9","15","17 August 2005"," HIGHLY overrated little film
","This is a movie that has kind of been part of my general pop consciousness most of my life, since it came out 13 years ago when I was only 6. Today, after years of watching snippets of it on tnt in no particular order, I finally sat down and watched the whole DVD straight through. Boy, a disappointment. For one, I'm a huge, huge, HUGE fan of the book (and an English lit major), and as this is billed as ""Bram Stocker's Dracula"" one would assume it'd be pretty close to the book. In a lot of ways (and this redeemed the film somewhat) it was, down to certain lines coming write of the page, and the ""diary/letter"" format. Also, I was thrilled with the attention to some little details, such as Harker's hair gradually whitening, as it does in the novel. However, there are a lot of departures. For one, the characters of Jack Seward and Jonathan Harker are really minimized, and both are portrayed as pretty ineffectual and frankly quite lame. Granted, some of this is due to a rather stiff performance than Keanu Reeves (who I grudgingly kinda like), but mostly it's bad direction and them just being written out of the story. WHY, you may ask, are they so diminished? Because of the ludicrous back story involving Dracula's ""Lost love"" Elizabetta, who happens to look JUST LIKE Mina Harker. This is what really ticks me off. In the book, Dracula is evil, plain, pure and simple. Mina is a bright, sensible, devoted young woman, in love with her husband, and attacked by a demon. She is pretty darn resourceful in fighting the demon, suggesting that Van Helsing hypnotize her so they can spy on Dracula, and making sure that someone, if not Harker, then Seward or Quincy or Arthur, will kill her if she becomes evil. She certainly doesn't beg Dracula to change her, nor does Dracula have any qualms about turning her. ""I love you too much"" my foot. The whole plot line undermines the integrity of two of the main characters, making Dracula sympathetic, and Mina lukewarm at best. Psh. Having said that, the rest of the film is flimsy, highlighted by good moments and awkward moments. It's a very artsy film, which I know was the point, and a lot of times it works, but at other points, it's over done. The gore, violence and sexuality, while very deeply ingrained in the Gothic nature of Stocker's novel, is also taken a bit too far in a few cases. Also, Dracula-as-wolfman/batman is just ridiculous and pretty poorly done, even if it WAS 1992. By way of performances, Keanu Reeves is a bit stiff, and not so much British, Winona Ryder just plays Winona Ryder, as she does in every other film, Anthony Hopkins is a bit much at some points, as if he can't tell if his character takes this seriously or not, Sadie Frost is excellent if a tad over sexed, and Gary Oldman. . .well I'm so disgusted with his character it's hard to say. . .he's okay, but far too sympathetic, and frankly, a bit weak. No one else is given enough screen time or development to really make a comment. Final thought. . .I know that often movie adaptations of novels make big departures, and I can be cool with that (I give you Jackson's LOTR trilogy, which I love). Such departures, however, must be made within the spirit of the novel. This massive departure ruins the effect, and completely muddies Stocker's view of his creature. That's why I have to give this movie only five stars, and those stars are mostly for style and sheer guts."

","Francis Ford Coppola's take on the Dracula legend sees Gary Oldman as the Count, who as a warrior prince returns from battle to find his true love, who after believing him to have been killed, has committed suicide. Renouncing his Christianity he pledges to return from the death to enact revenge on humanity. Century's later he is back to keep his word but becomes infatuated with Mina (Winona Ryder) who bears a resemblance to his long dead true love.<br/><br/>Forget the Bram Stoker bit, this is liberty taken wholesale, and forget any notion of this being a scary Dracula movie, for this is Gothic romance opulence. There is no doubting that as a production design goes, it's top dollar, costumes, photography, score, sets and puppetry etc, all the money is up there on the screen to please the eyes and the ears. But the narrative shift to make Dracula a tragic longing figure is a mistake, as is several casting decisions and performances. It's actually easier to say who comes out of it with credit, so step up Tom Waits as Renfield and Richard E. Grant as Dr. John Seward. Oldman is committed to the lead role, and has tortured soul down pat, but someone thought it was a good idea to make him an old ponce and stick a set of buttocks on his head! You just can't take the character seriously from the moment he appears on screen.<br/><br/>There's some vampire erotica as Coppola caters for the horny horror faithful, though these scenes play out like an after midnight MTV video, so not really very sexy at all. While there's a lot of fun to be had, yes you read right, with a number of scenes inserted within the dull narrative: did the great Anthony Hopkins just sniff the cheese and Keanu Reeves attempt a posh British accent? Aaargh! It should have been a Gothic classic, but clearly Coppola was out of his depth tackling such a genre. After giving myself over ten years between returning to watch the film again, I can say with confidence that it's a film that gets worse on repeat viewings. That is unless you like unintentional comedy pictures? 3/10"

","I'm not one of those people who thinks that a screen adaptation should be forced to ""follow"" the novel or other original source material exactly. But I do believe that a screen adaptation should at least conform to the spirit of the original. This adaptation fails to do that, even though it ""follows"" the various events of the novel more closely than most other films bearing this title. The novel, as written by Bram Stoker, is the story of a few flawed but good humans versus a powerful creature symbolizing ultimate evil. Stoker's Dracula is pure selfish appetite coupled with a ruthless determination to satisfy that appetite, regardless of who gets hurt. That's what makes him totally evil, and totally fascinating. The character loses much of his symbolic power if he's portrayed as just an ordinary villain. To put it another way, we cannot imagine Stoker's Dracula refusing to bite the heroine when given the opportunity, while he whines, ""I love you too much,"" as the Dracula in this film does. Even though the Dracula films made with Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee tend to stray far from the events of the novel, they are much more compliant with Stoker's brilliant vision of the Count."

"jon-voight69","2","18","36","12 May 2008"," Gary Oldman's ""Dracula""
","Others have discussed at length this film's numerous departures from Bram Stoker's magnum opus. However, I feel that Gary Oldman's many contributions to these departures have been sorely overlooked by the IMDb reviewing community. I will address these momentarily.<br/><br/>First, a few words about the direction and concept behind this film.<br/><br/>It is clear that this movie was driven by two primal forces: (1) Gary Oldman's egomaniacal desire to be portrayed as a Victorian sex object, and (2) the makeup department. That this movie was driven by these forces amounts to a coup de tate, with director Coppolla, the famed director of ""jACK"", left by the wayside. I am willing to forgive Francis for this film, if only because every director is bound to create a ""Dracula"" at some point in their career. After all, David Fincher has his ""Alien 3"" and his ""Panic Room,"" while Michael Bay has his entire resume.<br/><br/>Conceptually, this film is lacking. It is not clear to me why ""Dracula"" merits a modern retelling, particularly when the Count himself comes off looking not like a horrific soldier of Satan, but a retired employee at the Waffle Crisp cereal factory...on a bad day. More importantly, the ""love"" theme, as well as the film's constant forays into bestiality, is curious and distracting, at best-- disgusting at its worst. When Lucy is being eaten out by Gary Oldman in wolf form and he flashes a toothy smile for the camera, I almost stopped watching.<br/><br/>In light of these concept flaws, the casting was absolutely dreadful. Where do I even begin? Keanue Reeves plays Jonathan Harker with all the subtlety and emotion of Agent Smith-- a computer generated enemy. His accent is only outstaged by the Academy Award-winning makeup team that generated Gary Oldman's asshat (aka. his cafeteria worker- inspired hairnet). Winona Ryder constantly seems as if she has just been caught shoplifting, as she steals glances at the John Lennon-inspired Dracula. Meanwhile, a hopeless Anthony Hopkins plays Van Helsing with all the enthusiasm of Hannibal Lecter's dinner guests-- I sensed throughout the film, as if he knew exactly what he was involved in-- a carnival devoted to the makeup demands of a sexually frustrated Gary Oldman.<br/><br/>Many have the audacity to applaud this film's costume and production design. I have the sense to criticize it entirely.<br/><br/>The sets bring to mind the cheap cardboard outlines of 1960's Star Trek Episodes without the visual flair. The obvious use of blue screens during outdoor scenes left me begging for the cinematography of Daniel Stern's ""Bushwhacked."" Not only poorly executed, but the attempt to use shadow puppets to present Dracula's ""ulterior motives"", was conceptually ignoble. The chase scene to Dracula's castle attempted to mold Transylvanian customs and American West stagecoach drama-- it did not succeed. Victorian London is portrayed with all the creativity of a Compton street opera. The excessive use of fog is clichéd and distracting, the dark garden scenes do nothing to put the lesbian relationships into proper context, and Renfield's prison lacked a chamber pot. Costumes-- John Lennon sunglasses, velvet suits, Leopard Skin Pillbox Hats, Fu-Manchus, and red imperial dresses have no place in Victorian England, or our time. Coppolla's deferment to his costume department is unforgivable, but in line with the rest of this production. To those who believe that this film's sets, costumes, etc. were its strength-- I agree, if only because Gary Oldman is almost certainly its most glaring weakness.<br/><br/>The title character of Count Dracula is presented as a sort of desperate lover, a man whose murderous swath through 800 years as a demon is solely the result of lost love. I beg to differ. Dracula is a vampire (""vampyr"" as Van Helsing's book points out) whom we should hate and despise. That the female lead ends up falling in love with him is a testament to the fundamentally sick mind of Gary Oldman. I refuse to believe that Francis Ford Coppolla was responsible for the excesses of Count Dracula presented in this movie. Rather, he was held hostage by Gary Oldman and his lesbian female supporting actresses. Even Keanu Reeves cannot be held solely responsible for what happens to this film the moment Gary Oldman ""graces"" the screen.<br/><br/>The ""artistic choices"" related to Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula are crippling to the film's overall message and an embarrassment to film. Dracula likes to have sex? OK. Dracula likes to have sex with three female demon slaves? Alright. Dracula likes to have sex as a wolf? You're starting to lose me. Dracula likes to have sex with women and then cause their heads to explode in blood (a la Lucy)? What the hell is going on here? Dracula likes to have sex dressed as John Lennon? You've crossed the line.<br/><br/>I'm not sure when I first decided that I hated Gary Oldman in this movie. It may have been during the crude Romeo and Juliet imitation scene in the chapel that allegedly took place during the 1300s. It may have also been the time his shadow obviously popped a boner while making threatening gestures at Keanue Reeves. Most likely, it was when he was seen crawling up and down the castle wall in a powdered wig.<br/><br/>I hate everything this about this movie, but most of all, I hate this movie for what it could have been. Throw Tim Burton into the director's chair, Jon Voight, into Gary Oldman's prep room, and Dame Judi Dench into the shoes of Winona Ryder, and you have the makings of a modern classic.<br/><br/>I give this two stars for its comedic value."

Two words, okay: Sam Peckinpaw. Cut to 1897ish. Jonathon Harker (Reeves) shows up in Transylvania, ready to sell an estate in London to Dracula. Gary Oldman, with a rather disturbing haircut, starts doing odd little things that just don't add up: not showing up in mirrors, crawling down walls, never eating, that sort of thing. Soon, Harker finds himself a prisoner. The good Count has made it to London after killing the crew of the ship (Sam Peckinpaw again!) He starts simultaneously dating Harker's fiancée Mina and murdering Mina's best friend. Somewhere in there Renfield eats some flies. No real importance there, though, since they cut his significant role. The rest of the movie consists of Mina falling for Dracula while her friends try and kill Dracula. All this I could have forgiven if they had just killed Dracula at the end! This was not Bram Stoker's Dracula.

"FilmSnobby","3","14","27","17 February 2005"," Coppola's pastiche.
","I see that IMDb calls this movie *Dracula*. In my day, it was known as *BRAM STOKER'S Dracula*. Perhaps Stoker's estate litigated at some point during the past 13 years? -- for this movie certainly isn't Bram Stoker's *Dracula*. It is entirely Francis Ford Coppola's *Dracula*. I mean, I commend Coppola on assigning the correct names to the two main heroines (Mina Murray and Lucy Westenra), which, in the history of film adaptations of this novel, is oddly a first . . . but come on! No adaptation in which the Count is the main character can rightly be called *Bram Stoker's Dracula*.<br/><br/>I also don't recall the scene in the book where Dracula appears in a red satin long-trained kimono. Between that attire, the white grease-paint on the face, and the ornate hairdo that includes a complicated braid topped off with what can only be described as a derrière-shaped basket on Gary Oldman's skull, this Dracula resembles nothing so much as an aging geisha. (Ill-advisedly, Coppola hired a Japanese costumer named Eiko Ishioka to handle the wardrobe. The story takes place in TRANSYLVANIA and ENGLAND, Francis!) Without belaboring the plot's particularities, let it be said that Coppola basically takes the easy way out and turns the thing into a Harlequin romance. ""I've crossed oceans of time to find you,"" murmurs our Undead hero, as he gazes into the vacuity of Winona Ryder's eyes.<br/><br/>The movie DOES start out promisingly. We get some back-story on the vampire: Coppola and the film's writers go Stoker one step further and explicitly conflate the fictional Count with the Middle Ages ruler Vlad Tepes (""The Impaler""), who terrorized much of eastern Europe in the 15th century. (Strangely, Stoker had sort of dodged Dracula's ""true"" identity in the novel.) Coppola and cameraman Michael Ballhaus have great fun with the mise-en-scene for the prologue sequence: silhouetted soldiers, moving stiffly in a deliberately stylized way, spear one another in the foreground of a hellish red sunset. Later in the movie, Coppola will reference this bit again at a ""cinematograph"", in which the dark soldiers -- appearing on the screens presumably because Dracula happens to be there -- become like little marionettes ineptly trying to stab each other. The visual motif here is obviously an homage to a famous bit in Dreyer's *Vampyr*. Neat-o. But this sort of thing ends up being the main problem with the movie: much of the visual references are inside jokes appealing mainly to cinephiles (there is, for instance, a torch-holder on a wall in Drac's castle that is shaped like a human arm, a la Cocteau's *Beauty and the Beast*). Almost every scene ends in a silent-era style ""iris dissolve"". The lurid color-palette is an homage to the look of the old Hammer Studio horror films. All the heavy feminine panting and moaning would fit just as well in a Dario Argento movie. The true buff will also notice the photographic similarities to John Boorman's visually sublime *Exorcist II: The Heretic*, particularly during the climax when the heroes race against the sunset to catch up with Dracula. I mean, so on and so forth, for more than 2 hours. However, what the average horror fan -- or Dracula fan -- will get out of all this remains unclear.<br/><br/>In any case, Coppola isn't content with merely referencing film-work from the past; he feels he must OUTDO them, pointlessly laying on the undiluted fruit-punch blood (smite a stone cross with a sword in this movie, and the stone gushes blood), the hallucinogenic phantasmagoria, the overall hysteria. The movie is all spectacle -- no scares.<br/><br/>One can't finish a review of this movie without mentioning the acting. Gary Oldman is in Method Mode, over-earnestly delivering his tone-perfect Romanian accent. He sounds as if his mouth is full of marbles -- he is, for the most part, incomprehensible. Others here have mentioned the inadequacy of Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves -- wait till you hear Reeves say the phrase ""If I may inquire . . ."", or, even better, the place-name ""Bukovina"" (!) in a ""British"" accent. PRICELESS. The worst of the bunch, however, is Anthony Hopkins, but this is probably because the writers tried to make Van Helsing a funny character. Didn't work, guys.<br/><br/>3 stars out of 10, primarily for not being boring."

Very bad indeed. Shame on you all. Yuck. Go back to school.

At best it is a testament to early 1990's gimmickry larded on top of poor dialog and almost supernatural idiocy.

"mnpollio","1","9","16","8 March 2007"," Atrocious!
","I adore the original classic novel by Bram Stoker and looked forward with relish to see Francis Ford Coppola's take on it, but the end result is a total disaster. Despite incorporating the author's name in the title, the end result is far from the author's original work in both tone and content. Technically, the film is beautiful. The visual effects are eye-catching, the cinematography is lush and the score is moody in a way that thoroughly evades the remainder of the film. This film adds some of the characters from the novel absent from earlier film incarnations, but as the result is irrelevancy it seems pointless. The biggest disaster is in the film's vision of Dracula. The opening attempts to tie him in with the legend of Vlad the Impaler, the inspiration for the character but something Stoker never actually did in the novel. It also introduces a ""tragic"" love story completely missing from the novel and for good reason - it sucks big time. Apparently, there is some unspoken rule in vampire films now that the focal creature of the night must be a romantic figure - so instead of Stoker's vermin-like embodiment of pure evil, we end up with an undead Heathcliff. Gary Oldman, initially plastered into old man make-up and sporting a thick Romanian accent that garbles most of his lines, metamorphoses into an 18th century ZZ Top member and fails to generate either chills or elicit sympathy. Winona Ryder, as the object of his affection, has never been more ravishing, but the screenplay cannot decide whether she should be frightened or be a heroine from a grade-Z bodice-ripper, lustfully inserting ""Oh, my love"" as every other line. The normally reliable Anthony Hopkins is a laughable ham as the venerable Van Helsing, and the less said about the remainder of the cast, including the hapless Keanu Reeves in a nothing part, the better. Coppola's visual style is also off-putting and takes one consistently out of the setting. Honestly, was he directing a film or an MTV video? And was that werewolf creature actually raping that woman? Ughh! By the time Ryder does a wild gypsy dance to bring on the night quicker and tearfully puts her beloved out of his misery, you are ready to drive a stake through all of them, especially the director and the screenwriter."

Gary Olman as Dracula just didn't work, and Anthony Hopkins didn't seem to be interested in his role as van Helsing , overall, just bad. The shame is, they are two actors I have a lot of respect for.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of the Horror genre and have seen many truly horrible horror movies.

","The craftsmanship in this movie is mostly good. The effects are decent for the time, the wardrobe is well made, and the colors and music work well to create a nice mood.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting is good. Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins and Winona Ryder all do a convincing job. Sadly, Keanu Reeves has a rather important role, and between his utter inability to show any sort of human emotion and his absolutely laughable version of British English, he completely ruins every scene he's in.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I found with this movie was the poor script. It's as if they read the book, and then threw it aside and said ""hey, let's make a vampire movie"". The character assassination of Mina Harker (Winona Ryder) in particular must make Bram Stoker turn in his grave. In Stoker's text, she's a remarkably intelligent woman who several times bails out the rest of the group by coming up with the next move, and while she has empathy for Dracula, is completely dedicated to his destruction. In the movie, she's some sort of love-stricken helpless floozy who wants to help Dracula. Most of the other characters have been made much less likable as well.<br/><br/>Obviously, a movie adaptation of a book will (and should) not be identical to the book, but turning what is a somewhat metaphysical detective story into a very hokey love story was just a very bad idea. It simply doesn't work.<br/><br/>I would say that overall, the movie is pretty terrible."

","Love Never Dies? Is that the tagline? Who thought that up? Well, I tell you something love does die. I used to love Betty Rubble from the Flintstones, but when I saw the movie it was Rosie O'Donnell! Ewww! I soon fell out of love then, I can tell you.<br/><br/>But enough of my failed romances, here's what's wrong with Dracula:<br/><br/>Firstly there's this guy who runs around killing loads of people and impaling them on spears so that they can die slowly and painfully. He's called Vlad and has got this girlfriend called Elizabeta. Now I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure that if I ran around impaling people on spears or maybe even just one person, I'd be hard pushed to find a willing cellmate, let alone a girlfriend, but clearly Elizabeta likes bad boys. Well she gets confused and thinks that he's dead so she commits suicide (because someone throws a note through the window saying something like `Hi, how are you? Vlad's dead. Love and Hugs, the enemy.')<br/><br/>Vlad is upset and shouts at god, blaming him for Elizabeta's death (Duh! It's not gods fault if your girlfriend's stupid) and becomes damned, so that he can spend eternity looking for his girlfriend. Now, if she's committed suicide then surely she'd have gone to hell and all he had to do was throw himself out of the window and they'd have been reunited. But you see, like his girlfriend, Vlad is a bit thick, and chooses to be damned instead.<br/><br/>
Fast forward to Victorian England and a guy called Jonathan, who is pretty dull and boring and doesn't impale anyone or suck their blood. He's engaged to a girl called Mina who looks a lot like Elizabeta, and is probably the re-incarnation of her. Notice that Mina is played by Winona Ryder and not by Rosie O'Donnell, then we'd have seen if love never dies! Anyway, Vlad, comes to England and manages to kill some people and Mina falls in love with him and leaves Jonathan. A bit later Jonathan tries to kill Vlad and SUDDENLY Mina starts getting angry with him! Stop being such a hypocrite woman. Sure, Vlad can go out and kill a few dozen virgins, but as soon as Jonathan starts trying to eradicate blood-sucking monsters, he's in the wrong!<br/><br/>Maybe it's just that I'm an old cynic after the Betty Rubble/Rosie O'Donnell incident, but if Mina was my daughter and came home with Jonathan, I'd think that he was a nice guy a bit dull, but he had a good job and an interesting accent. But if she came home with Vlad, I'd be quite displeased, particularly when the killing/impaling started.<br/><br/>So go and watch Dracula if you think that love never dies, but if like me, you think that love is like a precious orchid, which needs constant attention and care then take you're date to watch a proper romantic movie, like Porky's or Battlefield Earth."

I wonder where that could have come from, though; because I cannot imagine that anyone could find this film to be as great as rumored, I mean, its not even a good one.<br/><br/>Perhaps there is a bit too much of Anne Rice in me, but I couldn't take the whole part with the Count turning into a werewolf and all that. The mist and the regular wolf perhaps, but not the werewolf and certainly not that big bat-thingy right before they left London for Transylvania at the early end.<br/><br/>Also, what's with the whole thing with the count being old in the beginning but young in the middle of the film? Is he so vain (or cares so little of himself) that he doesn't find a reason to look young before he goes to London and spots Mina? Why would he want to become old and ugly in the first place, if he had the power to stay young?<br/><br/>Then we have the film itself. The lighting is awful! Somewhere along I thought that perhaps this was a joke, to make the film look as much as an old Italian horror film from the 1930's as possible, but in colour.<br/><br/>The red light in Transylvania is laughing stock, and when Keanu Reeves opens a chest and uses his candle to look into it, but the chest still being lit up when he puts the candle aside is among the worst I've seen.<br/><br/>The special effects are often pointless (Dracula's shadow, not doing the same as himself for example) or so bad that it just makes one laugh. Come on! They shot ""Star Wars"" 15 years prior to Dracula, but still SW has better effects! The only effect worth noticing really, is the sequences when wounds are opened or closed (such as Mina's burn on her forehead, or Dracula's chest wound that Mina drink from).<br/><br/>I thought that ""Dracula 2001"" was on the limit on what I call a good vampire film, but now I realize that it is one of the better ones, for ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is probably the worst vampire movie ever (despite all the great actors).<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins does his character well, as do Winona Ryder. Gary Oldman does a great work as the Dark Prince, if one would want the character to be as it is (I surely won't, not after seeing how seductive Dracula was in ""Dracula 2001""). Keanu Reeves is usually one of my favorite actors, but here he just seem lost.

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>It must be difficult, being an aging wunderkind where both your own inertia and that of your sponsors drives toward ever-reduced risk. Further, imagine the additional pressure of being near bankruptcy because of extreme business incompetence. What to do? What to do?<br/><br/>Make a film that dummies will sponsor because they think audiences are dummies. Pick a subject that DEMANDS a trashy treatment. For the girl, get that girl from `Beetlejuice.' The doctor, that doctor from `Elephant Man;' the `boy' that dumb kid from Bill and Ted's party. A Dracula requires breasts and brilliant red hair, ideally on the same body so just do it. This way you can camp it up without penalty and do some `serious' filmmaking in the background when no one is watching.<br/><br/>The problem is that Coppola isn't a well rounded filmmaker. He is in the Italian storytelling tradition (with Scorcese). That mode invests everything in character; all situations, all the notions of `seeing', every visual excess is built around that notion of the individual driving fate. It was a success with `Godfather' because it breathed new life into a tired genre and invested Italian characters with their own world.<br/><br/>The excesses here are intolerable, precisely because he fights Stoker's key notion: that fate drives the characters, not the other way around.<br/><br/>`No matter,' we can imagine him saying, as long as I do my intelligent stuff in the background. Katz/Merhige would later successfully develop the notion he uses here of the `shadow"" of the vampire in the film of that name which is deeply self-referential: films about films, representations about representations. Coppola does a childish version here:<br/><br/>
<ul><li>A dozen times or so we have the film itself as a shadow puppet play, merging into use of Dracula's shadow and further into both his other forms and the use of shadow overall. In another project, I might be awed by how manifold this is, and how well integrated. But in fact, the folds are integrated with neither themselves or the story, and especially not the shadows of the film itself (as was the case with `Shadows'). Incidentally, `Shadow' was produced by Coppola's equally blunt nephew, but he wisely kept an arm's length.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>He does do a clever thing with the notion of film itself. As Dracula comes to London, the nature of the film turns into a zoetrope which is both the name of Coppola's (financially troubled) studio and is featured in this same scene where Dracula meets Mina. Get it? The world of the imaginary meets the world of the real? Note that the staging is copied from a similar scene, with similar intent, in `Chaplin' of the same year by buddy Attenborough.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The scene where Hopkins draws a circle of fire around himself to ward off temptation by the devil (including sex) is a direct reference to buddy Scorses's scene in `Last Temptation of Christ' which dealt with precisely the same thing. In fact, he is using the same cinematographer.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Because the red hair means closer to the supernatural, Lucy is the first to go. Watch closely as Mina discovers Dracula (as a beast) ravishing Lucy in the garden. As he looks at Mina, his gaze turns her hair red. It is a pretty complicated effect that she doesn't exploit.</li></ul><br/><br/>All this motion, and none of it particularly intelligent, none of it coherent.

","First of all, it didn't take long to realize that, if you read the book, this movie stinks. The biggest similarity between the book and the movie is the characters' names. The content itself has very little in common with the book. The book is a classy tale that makes Dracula and his background a dark mystery that is lurking somewhere in the back-story just waiting to be uncovered. I think a movie that did just this would be very interesting and intriguing. Oh, nay, nay. This movie makes up some love story that makes Dracula some victim of an over-anguished heart.<br/><br/>Secondly, the book was TASTEFUL. There was very little sexuality in the book. The movie couldn't wait to take its clothes off and throw some breasts. Lucy begins as some immature girl who can't wait to talk about sex and carnal pleasures. Mina is the same way. In the book, Lucy was a smart and behaved young adult, as were the rest of the characters. The movie just didn't make the characters into those mature individuals that they should be.<br/><br/>Lastly, the movie is NOT accurate to the time period.

","Well, what can one say about this butchering of a literary classic? It is not often that I feel compelled to comment on a movie, but in this case I couldn't stop myself. While the average movie goer who hasn't read the novel may find this movie to be entertaining (fair enough, as the acting and production values are all decent), anyone who has read the novel will be appalled. Now I don't believe a movie adaptation should follow its source verbatim, it should at least maintain its spirit and focus.<br/><br/>Firstly, the focus. As many on here have already stated, the novel depicts the human struggle against the supernatural Dracula, the movie has invented a ""timeless"" love between Mina and Dracula. This is bad for two reasons, firstly it destroys the real timeless love between Jonathon Harker and Mina that was fundamental to the ultimate victory against Dracula. Secondly, it humanises Dracula and tries to excuse his fall into damnation because of love as well as inventing Mina as the reincarnation of Dracula's dead bride.<br/><br/>Next, the characters have all been distorted beyond recognition. Lucy has been turned from a classy, lovely lady whom one could believe that three distinguished gentlemen such as John, Quincy and Arthur could all fall in love with, into a trollop and whore whom repels whenever she opens her mouth. Mina I have already mentioned, but when in the movie she openly volunteers to become a vampire and drink Dracula's blood, I wanted her to be slaughtered with him and get what she deserved (although I knew this wouldn't happen). The other characters, most notably John Seward have been stripped to bit part roles in order to support our timeless romance. If I was Harker, I would be getting a divorce quick smart.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was most painful. The hackneyed chase scene (understandable for entertainment purposes), Quincy's death was handled without the dignity the character deserved, the farcical redemption of Dracula with Mina at the end, I could go on. Don't remind me of the Vlad that Impaler introduction, it was cringeworthy.<br/><br/>I could go on, but ultimately, this movie is only insulting to those who read and appreciated the novel. I didn't not give this movie a '1' as many detractors have, as the movie is far from unwatchable from a neutral viewpoint. It is by no means a masterpiece even then, as it was very overblown, especially the Dracula special effects. Personally, I couldn't wait for the movie to end and I will most definitely never watch this movie again."

","Bram Stoker's Dracula is a masterpiece of a disaster. The movie lures the viewer in with brilliant cinematography and a lack of vampire jokes, and then tears apart the novel with horrible casting, bad direction, insufferable costuming, flimsy plots and utterly senseless decisions in everything while the viewer watches without a complaint, transfixed by the cinematography.<br/><br/>If you like the novel at all, you will detest this movie. It goes with the idea of having a romance between Dracula and the young woman Mina Harker. But instead of actually using the real characters from the book and creating a believable romance, they mangle both the characters to force them into a relationship that is realistic for neither of them. The casting of the insipid Winona Ryder as Mina does not help them. The whole romance plays around the idea of Mina being the reincarnation of Dracula's wife, who killed herself. The dynamic between them runs along the lines of ""Well, I lost you in that life, for I'm coming for you now."" ""Oh, my Prince...what were you saying again?""<br/><br/>The secondary characters are also quite lacking. Keeanau Reeves plays Jonathan Harker, Mina's husband, with absolutely no emotion at all when necessary, and far too much emotion when it is not necessary. It is hard to believe he did not act this horribly on purpose.<br/><br/>Sadie Frost plays a Lucy that may be completely unrecognizable to readers of the novel, though this I blame on the director, for Frost does well in what she seems to have been instructed to do. The scene in which Dracula arrives in England, a rain filled night when everyone seems to go insanely, with Dracula deciding that becoming a sort of wolf-human hybrid, Mina and Lucy deciding that they are bisexual, and Lucy developing a taste for wolf- human hybrids, may make this clear enough to anyone who chooses to dare watching this movie.<br/><br/>There is one advantage (other then the cinematography, of course) to this movie, and that is the chance to see Anthony Hopkins play the most interesting, slightly disturbing, and bizarrely close to the novel Van Helsing ever seen in a Dracula movie. So, if you want to risk watching the movie, I would advise skipping through the beginning and only watching the scenes with Van Helsing."

","There's no particular reason why a film should be faithful to its source; indeed, the best screen version of `Dracula', the John Badham version of 1979, is not based directly on the novel at all, but on the Edwardian stage play.  And a good thing too.  `Dracula', the novel, consists entirely of primary documents - diary entries, letters, newspaper reports, and the like - arranged in chronological sequence.  This kind of novel REQUIRES surgery when a script is being written.  But Coppola, possibly with an eye to his place in the history books, includes scenes, like the introductory ones in Dracula's castle, that only work in literary form.<br/><br/>Apart from including a handful of previously unfilmed scenes - for no very good reason - Coppola's film is remarkably unfaithful to the book.  Yes, this is no sin in itself.  But if Coppola is so foolish as to call his film `Bram Stoker's Dracula' he can hardly complain when critics say, `Well, no, it isn't.'  What riles me is that every change is not only for the worse, but also completely witless.  There are scenes of warfare in the Middle Ages, adding a plot element so utterly at odds with the central story, and so completely out of nowhere, as to render the film ridiculous in the first few seconds.<br/><br/>Indeed, Coppola has gone out of his way to make his film ridiculous.  (And yet somehow he seems to take it all so seriously.)  The sometimes-praised LOOK of the film is absurd: not natural, not nineteenth-century, not attractive, not anything.  Dracula has a blob-black shadow that moves with a life of its own.  Why?  It doesn't even yield striking images.  Transylvania is bathed in a ruby-red light that is otherwise only seen in Italian Hercules films.  There are pointless visual references to the fact that the story takes place during the first years of motion picture technology.  Why, yes: the story is also set around same time as the Boer War, but so what?<br/><br/>And the acting - oh, the acting.  Anthony Hopkins and Keanu Reeves bellow at each other in unidentified accents as if vying with each other to see who can make the biggest fool of herself. Winona Rider is cast adrift by the script, but I admit she does what she can.  All of Gary Oldman's talent is devoted to transmitting at least SOME sense of character from beneath his ludicrous make-up and Princess Leia hair-do.  This film is not some minor mishap.  It is a major disaster: an enormous bellyflop that drenches us all in stupidity."

"Spineshivers","1","11","21","6 March 2010"," Lamest piece of junk I've ever seen
","What did I just see? Where is ""Bram Stocker's"" Dracula? How is this accurate? I could go on and one writing ten pages here on how and why this movie sucked. I'll just point out some major flaws:<br/><br/>1.Lucy wasn't a whore looking at porn, she was actually a decent and rather timid person.<br/><br/>2. Mina didn't want to be a vampire and she was never in love with Dracula(not even under hypnosis) nor Dracula in love with her, if anything Mina gave directions to the monster's whereabouts.<br/><br/>3.Dracula was an intelligent, infantile blood sucking monster not a Don Juan. 4.The relationship between Lucy and Van Helsing, in this movie it's nonexistent where as in the novel Van Helsing cared for her much. He actually said that he has to cut her head in a sarcastical, funny way!! What the hell? These four denaturations are the main reasons of why this movie hasn't anything to do with what Stocker wrote, this isn't a romantic novel, at least not relating to the monster and anyway, not this cheesy.<br/><br/>Coppola takes out 60% of the original story, takes out what made the novel actually creepy: insinuations, shadows, and strange landscapes and turns them all into rubbish.<br/><br/>The ""Transylvanian"" scenes were a joke even for 1992 and did not deliver the feel of the novel's first pages, I could notice a mile away that they were in a studio, I'm curios how much money were involved in those scenes, it was all soooo artificial.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman and A. Hopkins delivered some decent acting but Keanu Reeves should stick to Matrix. Oldman's and the other actor's Romanian(except for the vampire women whom are Romanian for sure) sucks big time(I admit I ask too much here as I'm a native and it isn't an easy language) <br/><br/>There are hungreds of small things that further accentuate the alienations with the novel:<br/><br/>1.Most of the initial Transylvanian story line was shrunken down to a lame carriage scene and replaced with that ""story"" in the 1400s that had NOTHING to do with the book and its only purpose was to induce further false plots further into the movie.<br/><br/>2.Dracula's shadow and hair, OMG what the hell? He had a pair of boobs on his head and a comical shadow, I nearly *** myself laughing (and I was supposed to be scared!!!)Dracula (in the novel) didn't have a shadow as he didn't have a reflection and I don't know where Coppola read that he had hair like that.<br/><br/>3.The scene with those three vampire women, I must admit that was the single thing I liked about this movie but it was fake too, if the novel were newer and if Stocker afforded to be more ""libertine"" maybe he would have done it that way but he didn't! That wasn't a porn scene in the book.<br/><br/>4.Dracula didn't break Harker's mirror just by thinking it, he just threw it away.<br/><br/>5.Lucy wasn't raped by a big(poorly looking) Dracula wolf.<br/><br/>I could go on and on in how this movie sucked in terms of plot, landscapes, acting etc etc etc but it wouldn't make it better. This movie could have been very well a comedy or a parody, a lame one too, it almost makes Nielson's ""Dracula, Dead and Lovin' It"" (a parody after this movie) unnecessary and I recommend that one cause it is at least funnier. Coppola shouldn't named the movie that way if he wanted to do his own vampire movie(I think it sucked even with other names).<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this, awful. Sorry for my errors in spelling and/or grammar, not a native."

","This is a prime example of false advertising. The title indicates that it's the movie adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula but, with the exception of the character names, it has nothing to do with the book itself. It's a sexed up/Hollywoodian shell of the original story. It's a waste of time and I would have rather watched paint dry than this S%#&. Then again, with the exception of Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Oldman, the cast itself did not particularly build confidence of the movie being anything but ordinary. Back in Vlad Tepes' time, I think he would have used this movie to torture people instead of impaling them and ripping their limbs off."

","Although I may be a tad bit biased in my review (because this is my favorite movie) this is an awesome Dracula love story.

The cast selection was great! Anthony Hopkins was a fitting selection for the famous Van Helsing and of course Winona Rider playing Dracula's long lost love was just superb!The way it ended was just gruesomely romantic (which is where i I think true blood got its idea of the ending of Bill and Sookie from the final season, but that just my opinion..)

","If you haven't read the book then yes you may like this movie. However, I read the book and I was very disappointed. I know that most movies aren't EXACTLY like the book. But this movie added so much crap that it didn't follow the book very well. All of the people that keep calling this ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" are idiots. This isn't his, it's Hollywood's. I am sure a lot of them didn't read the book. The book is long and a little old and I did get bored. However, I am sad to say I liked it a lot better than the movie. It is annoying how some people are trying to compare it to the book who haven't read the book. Couldn't sound less illiterate! Please don't make reviews and say something like ""I didn't read the book, but I thought this movie was great.""

","I even reduced the spoiling in this, but it still is a SPOILER, I'm sorry <br/><br/>In my opinion, this was a really bloody movie - in both meanings of the word. My father told me it was a good film and I had to watch it (one day - maybe not before my 16th birthday, but he didn't say that). But I had to tell him that I didn't agree. I usually don't watch horror movies. I only watch them when they're about vampires. And then, it's not because I love blood and perverse ideas (there were a bit too many of them in this movie), but because I find vampires really cool. That is why I only enjoy these films when the vampires are presented in an  for me  acceptable way; and true vampire freaks possibly won't believe me when I say that I even liked ""Underworld"" and ""Van Helsing"" better than Francis Ford Coppola's version of ""Dracula""  because the idea of the vampires in it just fit better with mine. I didn't read the novel by Bram Stoker, so I can't compare it to the movie; I can only say that ""Dracula"" was a waste of time for me, because I didn't like it at all. I didn't like the story, which was hard to understand and partly ridiculous; I didn't like Dracula and the disgusting creatures he could turn into; I didn't like the nightmare-like atmosphere in too many parts of the film, and that is for the same reason that I don't like horror movies  I'm scared easily; I didn't like the actors' performances (though Ryder and Reeves really look good, but I'm afraid that's already all), nobody could convince me; I didn't like the exaggerated erotic scenes, and it really disturbed me that Lucy and Mina always had to show their breasts. But I liked the camera tricks, for example the fading of images. Which surely doesn't make a good movie for me."

","Watching this film is kind of like being downwind of a large cinematic garbage dump. It was supremely, incredibly, wonderfully bad. You can smell the dialogue and acting from miles away. Keanu is in full Keanu form with his Ed Wood-en quality acting. He is choice in Much Ado about Nothing, but he runs that performance a close second here. If you didn't realize that they all received plentiful paychecks, you might feel sorry for the many miscast actors. I recommend this if you're in the right mood for it! Great fun."

It is so frustrating when a movie has much potential but either the director was asleep during shooting scenes or the wrong clips ended up on the editing floor. What a waste of two hours. The characters were so much different than the personalities in the book. I never understood why John aged a lot in the movie, but then became young again at the end. I expected so much more from Coppola. There was some edginess that I liked, but some of the special effects were just dumb effects. He should have watched it"
"rmax304823","5","6","10","15 October 2009"," A Stylish Rendition of a Familiar Tale.
","It's like an Italian prose opera in seventeen acts, full of directorial flourishes, special effects, and epic displays of elaborate wardrobe and intricate sets.<br/><br/>Basically, it's the plot we're already familiar with from Bela Lugosi's first sound movie through various sequels and parodies. Renfield is a madman who eats flies. Harker goes to Castle Dracula to clinch a real estate deal with you-know-who, is semi-seduced by the brides, and imprisoned for a long time. Dracula takes a ship to London and moves into Carfax Abby. He sucks the blood of the frivolous Lucy and then turns his attention to the virginal Mina, fiancée of Harker, who has escaped from the Borga Pass and then Helsinki, I mean van Helsing, is called in on a consult and there is garlic and mirrors that crack and a cross that Himself finds disgusting and a narrow escape and the avoidance of daylight and smashed coffins in the castle basement and --<br/><br/>What dazzling imagery! Coppola's camera first hides Harker's and Mina's kiss behind the tail of a peacock. The eye on one of the feathers becomes an iris that dilates and reveals a dreadful castle half hidden in roiling gray clouds that shade into a murky vermilion. It's a feast for the eyes. Gary Oldman's hair do alone is worth a look -- two revolting wedge-shaped buns of gray extending from his head at oblique angles. Not that either the costumes, the set dressing, or the production design in general strive for authenticity. It doesn't look like London or Rumania in 1895. It looks like a nightmare after a mushroom omelet, in which settings resembling a ghoul-haunted London and Rumania in 1895 manage, after a struggle, to put in an appearance. <br/><br/>Winona Ryder is winsome with her too-tight bodice and long sleeves and those frightened calf-like eyes. Keanu Reeves is lightweight as Harker. Sir Anthony Hopkins' presence in the last half of the movie is encouraging because we all know it adumbrates the undoing of that bloodless freak and, thus, the end of the movie.<br/><br/>All this effort has gone into a story that isn't really very interesting nor even, in its specifics, very original. I didn't care much who lived or died though I hoped for a happy outcome. The lighting is striking. Not one scene in broad daylight -- not that one would expect poplar leaves fluttering under a blazing autumn sun. Everything is murky and dark, as it is in all movies about the Undead. The creeping, luminous green mist was equally well done in ""Something Wicked This Way Comes."" The smoky shadows lurching around in the carnation light were from the Frank Langella version of the myth. The scene in which van Helsing holds the cross over the spasmodic body of Lucy, chanting ""the power of Christ compels you!"", during which she vomits in his face, is immediately recognizable.<br/><br/>Dull and overwrought.<br/><br/>Unless, unless -- was it all meant to be a JOKE? Are we supposed to laugh when the Count tells Harker, ""I never drink . . . wine."" How about when Harker is first met at the Borga Pass by the black coach and the coachman is wearing the head of an enormous hawk? Or how about when one of Dracula's maids seems about to fellate Harker, opens her mouth to hiss at him, and reveals the incisors and canines of a saber-toothed tiger? Shouldn't any ONE of those things give Harker reason for pause?"
"SashaWrites","2","6","10","8 September 2006"," Future episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000
","(SPOILER is only in the very last paragraph.)<br/><br/>This film finally answers the question, ""What could be funnier than Keanu Reeves with an English accent?""<br/><br/>The answer is: a lot of other things in this picture. Such as Count Dracula's hairstyle throughout the opening, which looks like he's wearing a giant buttocks on his head. (In one of these first scenes, a cool and creepy effect is wonderfully ruined: the audience starts to notice that Dracula's shadow doesn't perfectly follow his actions, which is neat, but within the minute, the shadow itself is overacting to such a hokey and ridiculous extent that the only possible reaction is laughter.)<br/><br/>The only good thing to say about COPPOLA'S Dracula, is that someday it will make a wonderful edition of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" It didn't take long in the room in which I saw this film, for all watchers to start giggling, and eventually just descend into abject ridicule, of the absurd accents of Reaves, Winona Rider, and, reprising his fake Brit from ""A Princess Bride"" (where it fit, in a kind of Errol-Flynn kind of way), Cary Elwes; of the dumb special effects (that blue halo around the coach was pretty humorous); of the stilted dialogue; of the melodramatic direction and acting. You name it. This movie is fun to see with a group of witty people, but that's all.<br/><br/>This whole film was a shame, right down to calling it ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" Bram Stoker surely did a few turns in his own coffin on opening night, particularly given the Beauty-and-the-Beast HAPPY ENDING, in which Dracula is saved by the grace of Mina Harker's love. Unreal! Disgusting, really. The test audiences must have gotten to this one, so they utterly changed the (admittedly anti-climactic) original death of the count as related in, well, um, come to think of it, BRAM STOKER'S Dracula."
"theBeest","3","6","10","22 July 2006"," Hammier than Hammer
","I'm not a big fan of vampire movies, and I'll admit I've never seen the Beli Lugosi version, but this rendition was just ludicrous. I have read the book ""Dracula"", which is also melodramatic and old-fashioned, but I expected something a little more subtle and sophisticated from the legendary director of ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now"". Throughout this film, wolves howl and women chant on an incessant loop. Gary Oldman's makeup and prosthetics are elaborate and constantly changing - he becomes wolf-man, bat-man, and plastic-skinned-elderly-man-with-extra-joints-on-digits. Winona Ryder attempts an English accent (I almost wept!) and creepy shadow effects are bungled over and over again. Where's the subtlety? Never once was it believable. We are taught that a soundtrack is only working if we do not notice it. This one blared like a rude car radio. We are taught that fear comes from not knowing quite what the danger is. Oldman's Dracula does not emerge from shadow, but is illuminated from the beginning by excessive studio lighting. For all its opulent budget, this film never once began to draw me into the story - I was too caught up observing, ""My, what an opulent budget this film had! Look at the costumes! Look at the sets! Listen to that expensively recorded soundtrack!"" It never became real.<br/><br/>Another point which confuses me greatly is this: Coppola was determined to be loyal to the original text. He lovingly named the project ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". He apparently made the actors sit for two days and read ""Dracula"" together, so that he could make sure they knew exactly what happened and come to him with things he might have left out of the script. He wanted to make it just right. Completely faithful. And yet he allowed a highly prominent subplot to be introduced in his film: the suggestion that Mina (Ryder) is the reincarnation of his long-dead love, Elisabetha. Not only was it absent from the novel, it was quite excruciating to watch.<br/><br/>The performances rather upset me. Oldman was a disgusting mixture of earnest and hammy. Ryder was... well, she's more there for her heaving bosom, but lovely as it was, she just wasn't meant to play a period piece. Keanu Reeves put up a fairly decent performance as Jonathan Harker, but his slightly Asian features put me off balance. Like Winona, he just didn't really fit.<br/><br/>They say scores upon scores of movies have been based on ""Dracula"". I've yet to see one I was impressed with."

"MacBalthus","4","9","17","26 December 2006"," Too much for its own good
","After the first 20 minutes, you have had quite an impression of how the rest of the movie is gonna be. What works in a novel is not automatically right for a movie. I've read the novel and it was the only one ever to bring me nightmares, just with its sophisticated way of telling and explaining. The horror is hidden, crouching, spiteful. In a nutshell, quite amazing.<br/><br/>But the movie is a poor piece of trying but not achieving. Coppola made THE GODFATHER, one of the two 9.1 of this website. But this here is a great disappointment.<br/><br/>Why? Because they try to stay close to the book. Fine. Dracula is described as an old but strong man with hairy hands and a big nose. They did this here. But at this point it seems they've stopped to stay by the book and started to do their own flick. I can't recall that Dracula had some kind of a relationship with Mina others than his desire to drink her blood and make her his slave. Then this crap with Renfield. In the book, he escapes and fights with the strength of five man, just to have his spine snapped like a twig by Dracula a few pages later. Here, we see a whole different type. He also only eats one fly. If you start with it, you should go with it and not just drop it, because the movie gets to long even without this feature of it.<br/><br/>Lucy, the charming, beautiful and truly happy Lady Westenra appears here as a man-eating slut. Abraham Van Helsing, the sophisticated, strong, dauntless scientist is a crazy, weird and jumpy old fart, who can't even keep himself from kissing obsessed Mina. The three men in Lucy's life appear as shallow punks, hard to distinguish by their appearances or by their behaviors, but never to be taken as full breathing and feeling beings. Mina Harker, the good heart in the story, whose loyalty to her beloved Jonathan can't be shaken by evil powers is here the reincarnation of Dracula's old bride and actually in love with him! With him! If that's not crap, what is? <br/><br/>Last but not least, Dracula. It is true that Gary Oldman can fill a cinema screen with his charisma as the deep and bad villain. But here, he is not a former butcher, who killed whoever stood into his path, here he is the disenchanted lover, who lost his bride and can't bear loving a faith anymore, which bans his one love into eternal damnation just because she took her own life. This is just not the way it is in the book! Fine, do your own thing but don't claim to stick with something and just don't do it then. That's not the way to make things.<br/><br/>There's no horror in this movie, if you don't consider a poorly made wannabe-werewolf, a guy in a spandex-bat-suit, ridiculously green smoke and stupidly obvious shadow-plays to be horror. The scene with the wolf was a bit creepy, so was the man of rats and Renfield had the potential to be a scary character but they didn't make anything out of that.<br/><br/>Coppola tried to create horror by showing everything instead of just leaving hints like for example in HALLOWEEN, but he failed to show really scary images and so the whole movie appears like a colorful children's birthday. It simply doesn't work at all. It's not even especially nice styled or designed. They tried to copy Tim Burton throughout but never reached his class. The castle is a mistaken effort to build a memorable building, the Westenra Mansion is an annoying piece of architecture and, sorry to say so, but the costumes, which earned several awards, look like they were taken from the local Halloween spooky shop. It's more of a Scooby-Doo film than a true Dracula movie.<br/><br/>It's waste of talent, time and money.<br/><br/>Stick with HORROR OF Dracula with the incomparable Christopher Lee, THE GODFATHER trilogy and APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX. Forget this embarrassment."
"BA_Harrison","3","5","8","23 June 2012"," Bram Stoker's Dracula my arse!
","If I were to rate Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula based on style alone, it would get a pretty decent score, the film boasting some truly striking visuals achieved through a wide range of classic pre-CGI movie-making techniques. Coppola's bold aesthetic decisions are wasted, however, on a film which suffers from a dreadful script that strays way too far from its source material, features some of the most embarrassing performances imaginable, and is quite simply a very, very dull viewing experience.<br/><br/>Over the years, I've developed a pretty good idea of what makes for an effective vampire: undead soul-less agents of Satan, their only desire should be to feed on the blood of humans, the more cruel and ruthless they are in this pursuit the better—oh, and if possible, they should look cool while doing so. They certainly shouldn't fall in love.<br/><br/>And yet this film sees Dracula (Gary Oldman hamming it up for all he is worth), supposedly the most evil vampire of them all, sporting a really stupid get-up that makes him look like an old queen, and has him pining for a woman. And not just any woman, but bloody Winona Ryder, quite possibly the most insipid actress ever. In short, he's a bloody embarrassment to bloodsuckers everywhere!<br/><br/>As if that wasn't bad enough, the film also features Keanu Reeves in the role of Jonathan Harker, a more miscast actor you would be hard pushed to find; Reeves's lamentable attempt at an English accent rivals that of Dick Van Dyke's dreadful Cockney in Mary Poppins for sheer ineptitude, turning his scenes into unintentional comedy gold. Anthony Hopkins fares little better as Van Helsing, Tom Wait's Renfield isn't a patch on Dwight Fry's in the 1931 classic, and Sadie Frost is overtly sexual when she really shouldn't be.<br/><br/>For all the incredible sights on offer in this elaborate production (including the scrummy Monica Belluci once again baring her magnificent chest), this is a truly retched attempt at bringing Stoker's novel to the screen, and one that should be treated with contempt by all genuine Dracula fans."

"apoc_100","2","5","8","12 July 2006"," Abhorrent
","Before I start criticising the film I should like to point out that I have read the original book and that I thought the actors portrayed their parts brilliantly. Right, now that the pleasantries are over with I can point out why this film is absolutely abhorrent and why it should be avoided at every single hurdle.<br/><br/>The film is ultimately about a sinister noble named Count Dracula whose passion for his apparent resurrected wife Mina/Elisabetha (Ryder) returns him to England so that he can pursue her with greater ease. Obviously there are people that try to stop him including Dr. Van Helsing (Hopkins), Dr. Seward (Richard E. Grant) and Mina's husband Jonathan (Reeves).<br/><br/>I read the book and I thought it was a masterpiece-it was chilling, filled with suspense, some parts were gory even softly pornographic as well as being a proper novel encompassing the horror and Gothic novel genres. The film is only about 50%-60% faithful to the narrative of the original which I found insulting. The whole Dracula-Mina love story is extremely over portrayed and frankly serves no purpose to the story apart from providing a little annoying distraction. Furthermore, there wasn't enough Van. Helsing at all. In the book he is integral at finding out that it is in fact a supernatural creature-the vampire- that is wreaking havoc on innocent victims and not purely a scientific or medical means. He doesn't appear nearly enough in the film-in fact his role seems quite minor and I found this absolutely appalling.<br/><br/>I have another complaint as well. This film seems to turn the chilling suspense of the novel into some kind of soft porn flick with Ryder and Frost kissing in the rain as well as what seems to be a forlorn ""gang-bang"" with Reeves and the Brides of Dracula. This is absolutely absurd as in the book, the three brides merely seduce Jonanthan on a chair (a chair!) and not on a bed so they can slink onto him! Also , throughout the film, Ryder falls in love with Dracula. Why?! She doesn't in the book, why does she have to do it in the film! Her role in the book is intricate, clever and positive. She is deemed as a faithful wife to Jonathan and a devoted friend to Lucy. In the film her character is drastically altered to someone who is unfaithful and seemingly uncaring to the fact that her friend has died! Why did they do this? There seems no logical reason! Finally, and this is what I find ultimately insulting, the film is entitled ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". Yes, I understand that because of copyright reasons they had to rename it but is is so far from ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" it might as well have been written by your next door neighbour.<br/><br/>I apologise to the fans of the film for my continuous rant at its awfulness but I have yet to see a decent and faithful adaptation of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". Who knows, we might get one soon. And please, if we do STICK TO THE BOOK!"
"Draculas_guest","2","5","8","11 December 2001"," Visual flair can't make up for weak film
","This film looked stunning, it had a gorgeous array of colors and had an excellent level of production, but even that cant hide a weak film.<br/><br/>First off, the acting. Everyone else seems to have mentioned this already. Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder were dreadful at attempting to play an English couple. Winona Ryder's acting in this film was ok, but hardly her best by any standard. Gary Oldman was completley OTT as the Count, and would have been perfect for a cheesy Hammer film from the 50's and 60's. He may as well have said ""I vwont to suck yur blood"" and been done with it. His make up and clothing was lavish, but pure fantasy. Hardly the menacing figure of the novel.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins. One of the best actors about, and even he had to put up with another ridiculous accent. Perhaps this was all intentional, but it misplaced the film as a parody of Dracula, or a farce.<br/><br/>Obviously the book is far too large to be adapted faithfully to the screen, and a straight adaptation would have been awful, but some of the more memorable moments were completely skimmed over. The passage where Dracula is transported to England on the Demeter was described in detail in the novel. It creates a real feeling of dread as the crew gradually get picked off by an unseen force. Dracula is barely seen, but comes across as genuinely scary with incredible demonic powers. Yet the film only skims through the scene and drastically misses out.<br/><br/>Later on in the Novel, Lucy is attacked by Dracula. Van Helsing is called in and realises they are dealing with a vampire, and Lucy desperately needs blood transfusions to save her life. Again, in the novel Dracula is rarely seen, but comes across as horrific as he literally drains the life out of Lucy over the course of several evenings, creating a real sense of struggle as they try to keep her alive. However in the film, the scene is breezed through and any mystery is constantly killed of by Dracula's constant appearance as a B-movie hound or demonic creature.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes that were in the film lacked a real sense of atmosphere. Many of the outdoor scenes looked like they were filmed within a studio which gave the film an artificial claustrophobic feel, rather than an expansive Gothic atmosphere. More time is given to the story of Dracula's lost love and the romance between the Count and Mina, but this cripples the pace of the film, only when Mina drinks Dracula's blood does the romance have any impact, as well as horror. Adding depth to Count Dracula himself is a nice idea, but the idea of him searching for a lost love just came across as terribly cliched.<br/><br/>Overall the film felt deflating. Nice design, gorgeous colours, fabulous costumes, but plot and acting seemed hollow. Good for a giggle at Keanu Reeves accent, but the film felt very flat"

","'Dracula - Dead and Loving It' is a far superior film, because at least it is funny, while Coppola's film is not scary.<br/><br/>The character of Dracula is poorly written, the romance is unpersuasive, and frankly the whole thing quickly gets very boring. I couldn't care less for the fate of the protagonists and I was alienated by the fact that instead of horror I was being served a love story straight out of a cheap women's novel.<br/><br/>This film is pure kitsch, and it's not even entertaining kitsch. That's two strikes. The fact that good actors were wasted in this film is strike three. Coppola, you're out. I'll stick to classics like 'Nosferatu'."
"LeeVanNero","1","8","15","4 June 2012"," Overblown Pompous Nonsense
","In simple terms, this film is easily one of the worst I've seen in my 48 years on this planet. It contains some of the most diabolical 'acting' it's ever been my misfortune to witness. It just doesn't work on any level whatsoever, is pretentious beyond comprehension, badly scripted, directed and written. Oldham is truly awful, as usual, but it's the addition of Reeves and Ryder - check out those accents ! - for extra wooden effect that tip's this film from what might have been watchable nonsense, into a dire, embarrassing, incredibly expensive and totally unwatchable farce. Everyone in the film from Tom Waits to Anthony Hopkins - who normally serves up only the finest quality ham - is so over the top, so often and so intensely that it becomes nauseating after a very short time. It could only have possibly been made worse by being directed by the talentless, overrated hack Tim Burton. This film is basically trying - way too hard - to be horror for people who don't actually like horror, and is made by people who think they understand and can do Gothic, but really don't have a clue, a la Mr Timothy Burton. To my mind this version of Dracula is simply overly verbose, plastic goth, dressed up - emperor's new clothes style - as 'real literature' or art for the clueless middle classes."
"Steamlord178","4","3","4","22 October 2015"," Some interesting moments, but self-indulgent and overwrought in all the worst ways.
","I'm generally not a fan of Dracula adaptations that delve too deeply into his back story or focus on his human side, but of course that's entirely a matter of personal opinion. Our first introduction to Dracula, rather than the mysterious and menacing one we often see, is instead his back story, followed by a genuinely comical encounter with Harker in his castle. There's no buildup, it just drops us in amidst the bombastic music and crazy special effects that go far beyond mere foreshadowing. It's almost cartoonish. Give us some foreshadowing, build the tension until the moment Harker discovers the truth about Dracula. I understand Coppola may not have wanted to retread the same plot points that other adaptations have, but come on. I also wasn't a fan of some of the over-the-top visual elements, such as Dracula's shadow doing weird things all the time.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman does a good job with the interpretation of Dracula he was given, but never once is he anything close to scary; he's just silly. Hopkins's Van Helsing is equally ridiculous. I won't say anything about Reeves's performance. We...we all know.<br/><br/>The sound design is far too overbearing. What's with the random whispery sounds going on all the time? Is that supposed to be diegetic? If so then why isn't Harker freaked out by it? And if not, why is Coppola trying so hard to scare the viewers with silly things that aren't even part of what's happening in the film?<br/><br/>And then there's Mina. What a horrible, irredeemable character. The entire romance subplot was just awful, and it was far more disturbing than any evil act Dracula himself might do because it's just so wrong, and yet by the end we're supposed to feel something for Dracula and Mina and their relationship with its Love Conquers All conclusion? I don't think so. It's not a matter of hypnosis either; the film makes that pretty clear. Mina genuinely falls in love with this monster who eats babies and murdered her best friend and left her fiancé to die an agonizing death. Almost everything in this movie points to it being some kind of parody.<br/><br/>That said, it has some cool moments. There's a lot that is pretty faithful to the book - moments I haven't seen addressed in other adaptations - and it looks pretty great for the most part. <br/><br/>To boil it down to one complaint, I found the movie far too indulgent. Show some restraint; it works wonders in horror."

","Dracula was disappointing. The filmmakers spend so much time focusing on visual effects (which were impressive), that other areas of the movie suffer. Most of the performances are either flat (*cough*Keanu*cough*) or over the top, and the film itself seems disjointed. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer Tod Browning's Dracula or F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu to Coppola's attempt at Bram Stoker's novel."
"Moviefan-Two-Kay-Four","2","4","6","11 November 2017"," Satanic Torture Porn, and Little Else...
","This movie is both easy to describe, and yet difficult as well. I say this because while I like many of the design elements, the music, and some of the performances...the story and most scenes are outright horrible. They're far too explicit compared to the novel, and many scenes in this film have no place in Stoker's work at all. As I understand it, Francis Ford Coppola placed the author's name in the title to avoid either confusion or a lawsuit with Universal Pictures, owners of the classic 1931 film starring Bela Lugosi. Nonetheless, this film represents Coppola's desire for a Dracula story much more than Stoker's...so the director should have used his own name instead.<br/><br/>How to criticize this film beyond the title - oh, let me Count the ways (pun fully intended). First, Dracula's existence as a vampire is shown to be the result of him renouncing God after his wife commits suicide, and driving his sword into a large Christian cross...which gushes blood that Dracula then drinks. He even tells the priests in that scene, ""I shall rise from my own death, to avenge hers with all the powers of darkness."" That's some seriously messed up spirituality to begin with, and it appears nowhere in Stoker's book.<br/><br/>Second is the depiction of Mina Murray, as a reincarnation of Dracula's wife centuries later. Coppola's version of Dracula is motivated completely by this, in spite of the fact Stoker never wrote it either. More changes include Dracula's beast form attacking and having sex with Lucy, and Dracula giving his brides an innocent baby...presumably to eat or defile sexually. The writers were sicker with these inventions than Stoker ever was, and Coppola's a fool for supporting it.<br/><br/>Another element in the film is very common to adaptations of the story, yet it appears nowhere in the novel. That element is the idea of Dracula being an undead or cursed Vlad Tepes, a 15th-century prince of Wallachia. This is a very popular myth which has persisted thanks to Hollywood, but again Stoker never equated Dracula with Vlad.<br/><br/>Aside from the excessive sexual, Satanic, and gory elements in the movie, there's actually a very talented cast in it. Gary Oldman has done phenomenal work through his career, as has Anthony Hopkins. Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were fairly well-known in 1992, but had not yet reached superstar status. Billy Campbell's main role prior to this film was ""The Rocketeer"" for Disney, a perennial favorite of mine. Cary Elwes had done ""The Princess Bride"", which remains his most popular role 30 years later. But all these fine actors were wasted on a tale that, in spite of bearing Stoker's name, has only the slightest commonalities with the book.<br/><br/>If you're going to adapt someone's work, and use their name in the title...keep your film as close to the source as possible. This movie is a violation of Stoker's book in so many forms, the title being the least one. There's so much here that is absolutely horrendous; I'm surprised Stoker's estate didn't sue Coppola and American Zoetrope."
"rdvljunk","3","4","6","4 August 2014"," Disappointing
","What a absolute disappointed was this movie to the point of total annoyance. When it started it was absolutely stunning, the styling, the sensuality, the effects (for 1992), great imagery. And then suddenly it seems like the budget was gone, they cut vital parts from the movie (ok Prince Vlad is Dracula but we never see the transformation) and they finished it quickly. From the moment Jonathan and von Helsing burn the earth the movies turns fully the other way from high quality to 1930's board-carton special studio effect. The storyline is brought quickly to an end, the chase and fight that should be the climax is just a joke so cheap it was made. Even in 1992 this was probably laughable, maybe good for the 1930's. And there are many more, Dracula should rest in his own ground, but why then is he hanging like a bat on the ceiling at night (why is it still in boxes), when he is supposed to be most active? What is this guy in the jail having to do with everything? With the corruption of the original story this movie never should have been released and anyone that admires great classic literature should have risen against it.<br/><br/>Absolutely annoying after such a great start of the movie. And it kept me annoyed several days afterwards"
"Cristi_Ciopron","8","4","6","17 August 2012"," Testing a palette
","I have been out of blue reminded of Coppola's calligraphic, fancy and more atmospheric than scary 'Dracula', while reading an Italian discussion, brief and vivid, of the Hammer movies and their actors; however, Coppola didn't seem to look for inspiration in the Hammer films, when shooting his own 'Dracula'. There is a lot of beauty, and a lot of beautiful things, and much to be said about this star—studded shocker of exquisite calligraphy and high—minded; idiots may mock, if they wish. There was a time when Coppola—well, there were, _intermitantly, several such moments—when Coppola seemed to emulate Bertolucci; Scorsese tried his hand at this as well, but Coppola is the more telling instance. <br/><br/>'Dracula's cast leaves nothing to be desired—a team of stars, some of them in rocketing ascension by then. <br/><br/>What this movie certainly has, and in abundance, is gusto, appeal—immensely tasty kitsch. Like with most of his other movies, Coppola seems to have had nothing in particular on his mind—and in this respect, a comparison between the New Hollywood directors—De Palma, Lucas, Spielberg, Scorsese, Coppola, perhaps even Cimino, Millius and Stone might be thrown in here --some of these I have badmouthed and cursed here countless times, writing about their outings in a dismissive and contemptuous way, even with certain nastiness, as if Kusturica cursing 'Die Hard', which you must have found out that he did—I like all of them, nonetheless, and gladly watch their flicks—a comparison between the main New Hollywood directors, dependable craftsmen, would prove enlightening; anyway, resuming, Coppola often seems to be on to nothing in particular, and this surely is the case with his take on the vampires. 'Dracula' is more of a palette, a study of approaches, devices, etc.. I have seen it many times, and enjoyed it—twice in a movie theater (the first times I was quite disappointed, I now seem to remember), countless times on a video cassette. Very glamorous, very playful—avoid those campy, corny, cheesy—much of it works; at the opposite end, a movie that also works this way is PSYCHO, austere, restrained, stark, unglamorous—it can be watched countless times—even on a daily basis—for the sheer joy, and one that doesn't work and even cloys is ANGEL HEART .... <br/><br/>I thought Hopkins was very good in this. I hate Oldman's sunglasses—but Oldman clad in iron, with his medieval armor, that lavish Transylvanian teaser, with the return from the war . There is also a feel of Victorian corruption and spleen, insidious spleen, given in the over—the—top language of the big—budgeted kitsch ....<br/><br/>Do you at least remember, chaps, that ghoulish orgy, that made Reeves, then still in his youthful days, as it seems, a person so envied and despised, that dreadful fancy of submission and of highly corrosive so—called pleasure? One would suppose it nonetheless takes a very deviant fellow to enjoy that creepy orgy—to say the least—yet it even got a Friesian admirer—yes, a Friesian philosopher quotes it—as he quotes yet another image from the very same Coppola roller-coaster . More about him, below. One might suppose—one would be entitled to presume—that such sicknesses pass unnoticed but by the very perverted .... <br/><br/>Yeah, it looks as if for less than sane souls, for less than healthy minds, such rotten fantasies might prove of some interest .... <br/><br/>A convinced admirer of Coppola's goth exercise is the Friesian philosopher Kelley Ross, who quotes at least two images from the movie—the three broads taking over their victim—and Dracula morphing into rats, dissolving, dismembering into rats, turning into a running hoard of rodents. I have found these two quotes in Ross' pages, after all he's a consumer of popular culture—Cameron, W. Allen, Lucas, etc.; the more important fact to be underlined here about Ross' fair use of the popular culture tropes is that he doesn't distort them, or twist them to mean arbitrarily assigned things. In his pages, these places in the popular culture mean what they originally meant, he keeps their intended meanings, and finds interest and joy in these their original meanings; you should read K. Ross, in case you didn't already.<br/><br/>The unrecognizable Oldman under thick layers of makeup is a cartoon, but young Ţepeş's love is genuinely touching—that awesome line about the oceans of time—traveling oceans of time to find his lost wife—that's chilling, and mind—blowing . Drãculea whispers in a sonorous low tone that he had traveled oceans of time to find her, who had been lost . Other than that, Ţepeş—the Voivod of Muntenia, I mean, the historical character, the wild, perhaps demented cub of the Drãculeşti—has never been a favorite of mine, though we share the first name; I was 14 when I have seen, in that blessed summer of '92, my 1st Dracula movie, one starring Lee—but none surpasses or even matches that breathtaking, ravishing, heartrending and engrossing masterpiece, the NOSFERATU. Watch that one—in case you didn't up to now.<br/><br/>These are the best two intros in the whole genre cinema, starring two of the most dashing leads—Oldman, leonine in his armor, at the beginning of Coppola's 'Dracula', and Crowe, before the battle, at the beginning of 'The Gladiator'. Do you know other intros as dashing?"
"kclipper","7","4","6","21 May 2011"," Beautiful but eccentric adaptation of Bram Stokers classic love story.
","Francis Ford Coppola ambitiously directs this colossal budgeted adaptation of one of the greatest and most tragic love stories ever written featuring an all star cast and colorfully lavish set design. At times, this is too eccentric for its own good as some Coppola's films are, but beautifully photographed and an almost perfect performance by the underrated Gary Oldman as the Count himself.<br/><br/>After defeating an army, count Dracula returns to find his beloved plunged to her death after receiving news of his alleged peril, and is then transformed into the creature of darkness after swearing his revenge against God and humanity. Many years later, Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania only to fall victim and prisoner to the count after the realization that Harker's soon-to-be bride is the reincarnation of his lost love. The events unfold in a startling attack on the senses as Coppola uses a multitude of camera techniques and tricks to tell a modern age Gothic period piece that is as close to the original Bram Stoker novel as your going to get. This deservedly won three Academy Awards including Best Make-Up, Best Costumes, and Best Sound-Effects Editing. The only thing that hurts this is a weak performance by Keanu Reeves and his atrocious English accent as Harker (Keanu probably received the role at the time for his fame and not his talent), and the visual overkill makes the action incoherent at times. This is made up for by an awesome performance by Anthony Hopkins (as usual) as the vampire hunter Dr.Van Helsing and terrific pace that keeps the pulse alive throughout. The obscure but prolific singer/songwriter, Tom Waits plays the lunatic Renfield in a role he was born for, and Winona Ryder adds enough innocent charm as Mina. Overall, this is a successful effort by the creator of 'The Godfather' and 'Apocalypse Now'."

","In 1897 one of the greatest authors of his time, and I say of our time as well, published the absolute classic Dracula. One of the greatest books to ever be written. It is able to be read and re-read without missing a beat or being bored. Dracula is one of those novels that continues to excite and captivate the reader like few authors today even come close to doing. Sadly, modern films have learned to gloss over and ignore the genius behind the work and take the film into a completely opposite direction. And that's exactly what Coppola does here.<br/><br/>I don't think Coppola even read Bram Stoker's Dracula before he slapped together this horrible sham of a movie. While he focuses on the stupid unimportant details of costume design and lighting he completely changes the whole story line and misrepresents himself. I could care less what the story is like but happening to be a fan of the book when I bought this movie I was hoping to see Bram Stoker's Dracula portrayed on film not bestiality and lesbianism.<br/><br/>I really am disappointed in this movie but I'm glad that Coppola pulled his head out and moved on to produce some more interesting things."

( Loveline between Dracula and Mina, Lesbian sequence between Lucy and Mina, Harker being held captive by the three brides in Dracula's Castle.) The list of in-discrepancies goes on and on. Also, great characters from the original novel were simply downplayed into trash in this film. All four leading male roles were written as great men in Stoker's masterpiece. In this film, however, Keanu Reeves is a joke and really doesn't fit the role, Richard E. Grant as Jack Seward plays him as a fumbling fool, Cary Elwes is more or less a prick and very inconsistent. Hopkins and Gary Oldman are great actors, there is no question about that. I also feel that Winnona Ryder did what she could with a very demanding role. The failure of the movie is not the fault of the actors, but of the Director and Screenwrite. What was wrong with the original novel, why did they have to change the story so much?

It is also not dark or intriguing.
Looks like the actors signed on to work with the famed director and paid no attention to the script and totally hammed it up in whatever horrible accents they could do.<br/><br/>A large part of the blame must go to the adapter of the novel - you cannot just throw in your own fantasies and gratuitous sexual content (like writhing women in silk à la Ghostbusters only with loads of women whose tops are off, beasts in disgusting acts). Adding explicit sexual content or meaningless ""layers"" to characters that are not in the original (like making Dracula some sort of hot bad boy that women are attracted to), you are only cheapening the source material, not making it contemporary. When you add something to existing source material, it should be in tone with the rest of the content, respect the characters for what they are and also be in tune with the time period. In this film, Dracula is reduced to a poor confusing joke and Mina - what is really going on with her? Don't even get me started on Van Helsing.<br/><br/>With a runtime of 2+ hours, it is way too long for this borefest but still seems like everything was rushed.

","Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)<br/><br/>** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Coppola's big-budget version of the classic story features Gary Oldman as Dracula, Winona Ryder as Mina, Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing, Keanu Reeves as Harker and Sadie Frost as Lucy. It's doubtful there's a person alive who doesn't know the story of Dracula so there's no point in telling it again so how does this version measure up to previous ones? On one hand this is possibly the greatest looking version but that can't make up for how deadly dull the film is. The beautiful eye candy is certainly something to worship but without the strong story backing it up we're left with a real mixed bag. On a technical level the movie is pretty much flawless as the sets, costumes, editing, special effects and cinematography are all top notch. The beautiful rich colors of the costumes really stand out as does the magnificent looking colors of the sky, the castle and various other items. The special effects are also quite remarkable and especially the ones dealing with the aging Oldman. The way the make up takes Oldman's age from old to young is really a marvel to look at and the fact that the actor can still move and act through it is another major plus. I think Oldman gives one of the most interesting interpretations of the Count and he perfectly nails the tortured soul of the man. Oldman also has a very interesting line delivery, which worked for me as did his rather easy way of getting across his passion. I'm also a fan of Ryder's performance here and the naive quality she brings Mina. Hopkins too gives a strong performance, although I do with he had been given some better scenes to work in. The only one that really doesn't work too well is Reeves who should have never been given this role. While everything on the technical level is masterful, I'd have to blame Coppola for the majority of the film's lacking story. It really feels as if Coppola was so worried with the look that he forgot to do much with the story because in all honesty I was bored from the first ten minutes to the end. The film, running 127 minutes, feels twice as long and I can't help but wonder what went wrong here. I know many are going to get caught up in the story and perhaps rightfully so but this film has never worked for me and it's obvious that it never will. There's a lot to admire here but in the end this goes down as an incredibly flawed but great-looking film."

Oldman was excellent, but the rest of the cast were dire and the storyline deviated so far from the book, with salacious and unnecessary sex/nudity etc, that I laughed out loud in several places.

As so many others have commented before me, if it had been called by another name he MIGHT have gotten away with it. As it is, the movie bears almost no relation to the original text.<br/><br/>Coppola seems to think he's orchestrating a lavish stage musical rather than attempting to produce a 120 minute movie. The sets and costumes are fabulous, but almost all of the cast ham up their performances dreadfully. Only Ryder seems to have any tangible idea of her character profile. It was she who originally took the script to Francis Ford Coppola; it was otherwise going to be a TV-movie. From the looks of this, it should have stayed in that format. It truly is ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show Part II"" - only without the irony.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman delivers a performance as the titular Count which - while not completely awful - is decidedly poor by his standards. The less said about Keanu's accent the better; although I can see why they cast him purely on looks. Hopkins is merely average as Van Helsing.<br/><br/>The film is way too cluttered to take seriously, and as far as I could assess, the copious sex and nudity served no thematic purpose whatsoever. It did however, manage to keep my interest amidst all the silly theatrics. Coppola fails to treat the source legend with the respect it deserves and instead directs like a hyperactive kid let loose in a toy shop, brutally destroying the merchandise.

It is definitely NOT ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". It conforms to the modern formula of style and effects over characters and story. Emptiness. To see the closest adaptation, to the novel, which I have seen, watch the 1977 BBC production, entitled ""Count Dracula"" on You Tube. It's not perfect, but at least it adheres to the original story, and has people, with whom one can identify.

Why did Coppola feel the need to take the route of forbidden love between the Count and Mina when the love between Mina and Jonathan was already quite obvious in the novel? Another thing that greatly annoys me is the excessive amount of topless women in the movie. I don't care what anyone says - nothing can make a blood transfusion sexy, not even a topless Lucy.<br/><br/>Aside from that, Coppola did manage to stay somewhat true to the book. But his movie still falls short. I have to wonder if I'll ever see the day that someone decides that it IS okay to do Stoker's novel the justice it deserves."
"jenius82","Null","9","22","24 April 1999"," It could have been fantastic.
","The all-star cast featuring a string of famous names, with such a well-known director, should have been fantastic. However, in many cases, it just comes across as laughable.<br/><br/>The acting is not good, mainly due to the fact that no-one is speaking with their real accent. If that isn't the problem, it's due to the fact that the poor script requires the actor to writhe around in agony.<br/><br/>The camera work seems to be done by someone who has just got new equipment and is trying it all out to see how many cheesy transitions and different overlaps they can do.<br/><br/>I was certainly impressed by the costumes and the set design. One exception, check out Dracula's hair sculpted into a bum (not a typo!) when he turns away from camera. The make-up and fake blood definitely need work, though. I have a theory that they used cherryade.<br/><br/>It's interesting how the film sticks to the *real* theme of the book -- Victorian repression. This is typically shown within the film as nude vamps and the portrayal of Mina and Lucy as sex-crazed women. I'm glad that it was thought necessary to expand their personalities for this film, but this was not the way to do it. However, as far as I'm concerned, this is not *Bram Stoker's* Dracula. Dracula is portrayed sympathetically and there is a whole new plot thread involving him and Mina. Also, he is given more of an origin.<br/><br/>What they could have done was to admit that the film is about Mina and Dracula's love and therefore not faithful to the book at all. Take out the title reference to the writer and redo it so the love story is completely central.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the song over the end credits is beautiful. Haunting, evocative - exactly what this film should have been. That's not to say I didn't find the film enjoyable, just not for the right reasons."

","Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic can be considered better than some of the lower ones in the genre due to a few key factors. 1) a mostly stellar cast (Oldman and Hopkins fit into their roles splendidly, Ryder does what she can, Reeves isn't too bad, and great supporting work from Elwes, Waits, and Grant) that does well by Coppola's always keen, if not exceptional, direction of actors. 2) Oscar winning effects and make-up, and a genuine look to the period. To see many of the sets and designs is to be reminded of how good big budgets can do for the story. Michael Ballhaus is also an essential asset. And 3) the take on the Dracula story (while I can't confirm since I've never read the book) seems to take a solid, novelistic approach. While Coppola does give in to some excesses with some of the music and the editing, and some of the romantic stuff in the film is less than great, the film is worthy for fans of the book and genre. As pure, horror entertainment, it delivers the chills. A-"
"neazy","3","3","5","25 April 2018"," Horrific
","Absolutely horrifically awful. I've given it as much as 3 because I did at least make it to the end, though I regretted doing so. The script is horrendous, rendering every character as a hammy caricature - this is not helped by a a great deal of overacting, and such delights as Keanu Reeves' 'English' accent. The cinematography would be interesting if it were consistent, but the changes in tone are too drastic to allow it to become atmospheric, meaning itoften feels gimmicky. The cartoon sexiness, whilst a valid angle to take on the story, is unintentionally hilarious, and really destroys any sense of menace in the vampire scenes, especially when combined with the bizarre wolfman form of Dracula, which is a strange idea even without the terrible costume.
Some of these flaws would be excusable if this film was its own animal, but when your title is 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', you must expect some form of comparison to be drawn. This isn't even remotely similar in tone, characterisation, atmosphere, anything. It rushes at breakneck speed through events where the book, admittedly a slow burner, builds suspense superbly - this pushes the film's story into the realm of pastiche, and in failing to take enough care to make anything really matter, fails to justify its ending in the way the book does. There is no suspense whatsoever, and neither is there any real horror.
To be fair, they gave a little more agency to the women, and a little more circularity to the plot, corny and nonsensical as it was, but beyond this there is nothing to recommend this mess. A great disappointment."
"Hitchcoc","8","3","5","30 December 2016"," Oh My Goodness!
","Excuse me, but I just read a series of reviews by people who are disappointed by the fact that this movie didn't follow the same old script that has been done over and over and over again. They gave a provocative movie a rating of ""1"" so they could sabotage what most people thought. Go do something else besides writing about films. This is not a perfect movie, but it takes the basic text of the Stoker novel and extrapolates from it. People seem to be reacting tot he sexuality of this. If we go back to the seminal movies, ""Nosferatu"" being the greatest example, we see that sexual tension dominates these films as well as the books. Dracula has power over people. He can draw women to him. He is not an animal, but he is a sub-human with desires to dominate. Coppola uses this to show his evil intent. Gary Oldman is the most eccentric and wonderful Dracula to come along in years. When did it become written that every Dracula should be the black-caped Bela Lugosi figure that kids still dress up as on Halloween. He is a force to be reckoned with; he is evil; and he is powerful. Remember, people accept the scenes of him sucking the blood out of women without any trouble. Why not an evil abuser of their being? Remember, they are under a spell over which they have no control."

They had plastic in the 15th Century.<br/><br/>It doesn't get better.<br/><br/>His young bride does an Ophelia when receiving false news of his death, causing Drac to curse God and turn himself into a vampire by stabbing a stone cross and drinking the blood that issues forth. See Stoker page, er, um, ahhh. We get an early glimpse of Anthony Hopkins as a priest hiding behind a fake beard that makes him look like the Monty Python ""IT's"" man. Presumably his spirit is later re-incarnated as Van Helsing, or maybe Coppola was just taking the p*ss.<br/><br/>Speed forward (geddit?) 4 centuries and enter Keanu, who obviously hired Dick Van Dyke as his dialogue coach, surely one of the most ludicrous casting decisions in history - whoa! Garth from Wayne's World would have been better - turning up at Count Dracula's steam punk castle to flog him Carfax Abbey.<br/><br/>Enter old man Drac, looking like he's just stepped out of an Elton John video and mugging the camera for all he's worth. With Dick Van Harker and Queen Drac in full flow this plays more like Dracula Dead And Loving It. ""Bloody Wolves"" had me laughing out loud. Did Crappola - sorry Coppola just give up on Keanu's acting and stick the worst take he could find of him into every scene? Sure looks like it.<br/><br/>Cue Lucy and Mina giggling over Arabian Knights' porn - who does Lucy live with, by the way? In the novel it's her mum - here she seems to have set up a knocking shop on her own. The future vampire hunters are hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Yayy it's Withnail! Falling over a bear. You can read that scene in Stoker's book at page, er, um, ahhhh. ""Oh, Quincey...it's sooooo big,"" etc. Contrary to some reviews Stoker is not revolving; he's resembling the Hadron Collider and opening up new frontiers of particle physics.<br/><br/>Harker is left to the mercy of the vampire women while Drac heads for Engurlund. His dress sense does not improve. The ship views are spliced in from the Shogun TV series.<br/><br/>Good old Keanu - he somehow fails to spot the 30ft long Fresco of his future missus on the floor of his prison. One of the vampires has earlier unbuttoned his trousers and bit him on the....you can read that in the novel on page, er, um, ahhhh. Next long shot has said trousers re-buttoned. Coppola you didn't care, did you? Vampires can move about in daytime, although their powers are reduced. See the end of this review for further info.<br/><br/>After Lucy Harlot's seduction by Drac, which includes a werewolf shag (see Stoker, page, er, um, ahhh.) we have a lot of stuff involving Lucy writhing around like a bad porn actress, getting a boob out occasionally and the expert Van Helsing called in. Van, played by Hopkins like an Old Perv on steroids, is soon camping it worse than Oldman; his Dutch accent isn't quite as bad as Keanu's English one, but it's getting there. His Humping of Quincy's leg can be found on page, er, um, ahhhh.....<br/><br/>Lucy vamps it up for about 1 minute of screen time before being staked and beheaded. No sense of spiritual redemption at all. Her dresses may have been lent to Drac for his personal use.<br/><br/>Then we get lots of B*ll*cks about hunting Drac, although he has been wooing Mina as well, by this time, having recognised the spirit of his dead beloved in her. This is pinched from Karloff's The Mummy.<br/><br/>Carfax Abbey is searched, a set so little it reminded me of Stonehenge in Spinal Tap. The actors searching out Drac's boxes look utterly hilarious.<br/><br/>""Look what your God has done to me"" What? Stuck you in a Batman movie 20 years early? <br/><br/>There are some good bits - most notably our good Count suddenly transforming into a posse of rats, and the final chase is excitingly done. Remember vampires can move about in daylight. So why does Oldman stay in his box until exactly sunset? He pops out like a Jack in The Box.<br/><br/>Notice Keanu's ever-changing hair? A few grey hairs suddenly turn into Doc Brown from Back To The Future and then revert again. I had great entertainment watching for these sudden hair dye changes. Thumbs up, Francis. Anyway ""Our work is done, hers is just beginning."" Said work consists of impaling Drac a bit further and beheading him. Maybe she was supposed to spring clean the castle afterwards.<br/><br/>So Over the top it's frequently hilarious - it may follow Stoker's plot but all the tone and details are wrong - the director should have changed his name to Francis Ford Cobblers..."

"ashild-blovvig","3","3","5","18 August 2013"," Love it or hate it, but I can't believe some people actually love this
","I've been in love with the Dracula story for a long time now. Bela Lugosi as Dracula was just my cup of tea. Yes, it was a long time ago and the acting was more overdone than today, but I still loved it to my heart. And then I watched this. I love Gary Oldman, I adore Keanu Reeves, and I worship Anthony Hopkins. ALL of them were terrible in this movie. All. of. them! How is this even possible? And don't even let me start on Winona Ryder. I've really, really tried to like her since I saw her in Beetlejuice. But everything else she did just doesn't to it for me. I'm doing this as a review of the movie as a movie, not an adaptation of the book.<br/><br/>The movie was really boring to watch. The curves of action and interesting stuff happening had not pattern what so ever. It looked very interesting in the trailer, especially when I heard Oldman's laughter as Dracula, but I was really disappointed.<br/><br/>The acting. Oh god the acting. I don't know where to start. I really cringed and sat with a ""what the deuce""-expression in my face during the Dracula's Brides-scene with Keanu Reeves being seduced by some horny naked vampires. I get it, vampires are sexy nowadays, especially the women. I get the seduction. But really? He only looked at them and BOOM he looked like he was getting the pleasure of his life. And when he overly dramatically said ""Music!? Those ANIMALS!?"", after Gary Oldman had said the famous ""The children of the night! What music they make!""- line, and it sounded like he said it without having nostrils, I really couldn't take any of them seriously at all.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman has a huge repertoire as an actor and it is just awesome! But what happened here Oldman? Where you drunk? Did you eat something that made your bowel movements go ""oops""? Did you watch some kind of sad children's movie before you got on set? Because it sure looks like you did these things. Him as Dracula did just not work at all! I don't know what I should say about the accent, too thick for my taste. I have no idea what a Transylvanian accent sounds like, but I didn't like it this time.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins didn't make it to me either. I love his action usually, but here something happened to him. He was fitting as a Van Helsing, he did it OK, but there was no real feeling to it. It felt like he was just thrown into the movie by Coppola, saying to him: ""Could you just do this scene very quickly? Then you can go home"".<br/><br/>And Winona Ryder. Poor girl really can't act any more. There is this dead, boring aura around here that won't go away. It's like she knows there is a camera there and she wants to shine as the best actress you'll ever see. She wants to be Meryl Streep, but she is and stays Winona Ryder. No more. And I think the scene where she finds out that ""her love"" is Dracula and he killed Lucy. She cries for less than fifteen seconds. Then she clumsily, and very unromantically, says ""I love you"". And the ""Take me away from all this death"" line? Uhm, honey, you're talking to Dracula. He kills people every bloody night. You want to be a part of him forever? You're gonna have a bad time.<br/><br/>And Sadie Frost: stop acting like you're in an adult movie. Getting bitten in the neck and being sick isn't pleasurable, like you make it sound. It is supposed to hurt, not give you pleasure spasms.<br/><br/>And I can't even say how annoyed I was by some of the ""special effects"". The blood coming out from Dracula's ""torso"", his wrinkled face floating in the sky like in a badly made goth metal band's album cover,<br/><br/>I could rant about so much more, but I have one thing I want to say did go well. The makeup. Dracula's form as a bat and an old man was actually pretty scary. Whoever did the makeup made Dracula look frightening and threatening, which I don't see too often. The same with Lucy's vampire makeup. Maybe a bit overdone (we're talking the whitest of the white faces you'll ever see), but scary. I just got annoyed by thinking of the poor child being so frightened of her that they had to really, really sweet talk with her to do the scene. But credits and stars to the makeup artists. Thumbs down and shaking of heads to the rest, especially you Coppola. You did great with the Godfather. Don't ever make vampire movies again, please."

"Steffi_P","4","3","5","18 December 2011"," ""Lives for the master""
","The story of Dracula has become the keystone horror for each generation of movie makers. From the 1922 German expressionist masterpiece Nosferatu, one of the earliest true horrors, to the 1931 Universal Studios effort that made a star of Bela Lugosi, to the lurid series beginning in 1958 that would become the backbone of Hammer studios, the tale has been repeatedly reinvented for the tastes of each era. And so it continues to this 1992 version produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the godfather of American New Wave cinema.<br/><br/>The full title of this adaptation is ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", so Coppola obviously felt a need to emphasise the picture's roots in its source novel. It is true that this version takes much from the novel that the earlier ones leave out – the vampire's ability to transform into various animals, spoken extracts from the diary entries that make up the book's text, although this latter only really serves to highlight some of Stoker's occasionally substandard prose. But it also adds a lot of stuff that is not in the novel, at least not explicitly. Stoker made some references to the real historical figure Vlad the Impaler, but this adaptation makes it overt, and even suggests that Mina is the reincarnation of Vlad's wife. This allows for an emotional and romantic angle that is strangely effective. Coppola and his writing team also gives the story a flagrant sexuality. There is nothing wrong with this per se, yet it often seems cheap the way it is presented and inserted into scenes, like the audience-pleasing smut of an exploitation flick.<br/><br/>There are some unusual choices among the cast members. It was risky casting Keanu Reeves in a vampire movie, because there must have been a chance someone would try to hammer him through Gary Oldman's heart. There are numerous layers to his badness here – he is wooden when calm, unconvincing when angered, incapable of an English accent, and pulling of laughable facial expressions. His awfulness serves to distract us from the mere mediocrity of other players like Cary Elwes and Sadie Frost. Anthony Hopkins gives us a Van Helsing with dramatic substance, perhaps a bit out of touch with the movie's extrovert tones, but brilliantly deadpan in several moments of comic relief. It is however only Gary Oldman in the title role and a wonderful Tom Waits as Renfield who really seem to get into the proper spirit of things, both of them hamming it up fabulously.<br/><br/>And yes, this is very much a picture of style over substance. Indeed that is really its one saviour. It's something Coppola is good at as a director. There's a breathtaking atmosphere that is often closer to fantasy than horror. Coppola deliberately used old-fashioned special effects, some of which directly reference German silent movies (the rising ring of fire can be seen in the 1926 Faust), and it's nice to see these tricks – each completely seamless – used once more before CGI achieved total dominance. There's also a fantastic sense of rhythm, with crafty cross-cutting building the final chase to a crescendo. The stylised look is reminiscent of the Jean Cocteau directed Beauty and the Beast (1946) – constantly flowing cinematography and dreamlike imagery, something which only works in the context of the fantastical, nightmarish subject matter.<br/><br/>And yet despite Coppola's noble efforts to recapture some of the spirit of both the original novel and the aesthetics of his cinematic forebears, there is much about his Dracula that is low and weak – the tawdry sex references, the corny dialogue, the seeming inability to allow a creepy sequence to play out without extrovert shocker moments (the scene where Oldman shaves Reeves would be brilliantly suspenseful if it wasn't for its having three or four ridiculous climaxes). And these really are all common problems of the modern horror movie (despite how much everyone claims to love The Shining with its slow tension, its influence has been negligible). Just like the famous Dracula movies that went before, this one is very much representative of the horror movies of its age."
"madcardinal","4","3","5","10 April 2011"," Mister Coppola Drops the Ball, and the Casting Director Hires Two Bush-leaguers
","There are two big problems with ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" First, the movie takes too many liberties with Stoker's novel in terms of plot and tone, especially when you consider they went through the trouble of putting the novelist's name in the actual film title. This unusual step implies that you made a good-faith effort to stay true to the author's creation. In the book, Mina does not love Dracula at all and she is not the one who slays Dracula. And although you might be able to uncover some hints of sexual symbolism in the Victorian novel, the movie makes sexuality a major component of the story throughout. Now I believe firmly in zero censorship and I'm all for frank presentation of the female and male body and, if need be, sex - when it's artistic and appropriate; but out of respect to the novel, the eroticism in this movie is over the top, incongruous, and sometimes unintentionally comical. <br/><br/>The second big problem is the casting. A man of means, Francis Ford Coppola has made the gems ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""The Cotton Club,"" and ""The Godfather."" He could have insisted on top-notch actors. How he allowed Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder to assume British roles is beyond me. O.K., so the casting director made two grave errors, but this powerful director could have stepped in at that point. Reeves always comes off as stiff and lifeless and Ryder is seldom believable, and both are thoroughly American. Coppola could have held two casting calls in England, one for the character of Mina and the other for Jonathan Harker. By blindfolding himself and lobbing 2 balled-up socks into the British actors assembled, Coppola would have come away with a much better Mina and a much better Harker. Strangely, the normally superb Anthony Hopkins turns in an unconvincing and uninspired performance in this film. While watching the film, I got the feeling Hopkins realized the film wasn't going to be good early on and simply mailed it in. <br/><br/>The four stars are for some moments of eerily beautiful and effective cinematography. On the whole, this is a disappointment and a misfire."

Winona Ryder is awful, need i go on? Why the hell does Dracula turn into so many different creatures and beings? It's not enough he's a camp old man in Transylvania, but he also turns into a worm, a giant wolf and some kind of toxic green fart.

However, rarely has a master given us as memorable a film as Francis Ford Coppola was able to create with the expert team of filmmakers and actors in this movie. For starters, having Wynona Ryder play the role of the beloved Mina is one of the best pieces of casting ever thought by Hollywood. She's as smart and passionate, a force of nature who can't understand the extent of her spell over her doomed lover. Ryder is capable of showing emotions and passions in a few minutes with a gesture or a look. In the title role, Oldman is grand. He portrays the vicious demon in three incarnations, and yet, by the end of the film, we know that the forces that control him are beyond his control.<br/><br/>There is some unsatisfactory prologue that explains what led to Dracula's downfall. It all ties to a source of despair and despondence, an act that alienates him from what society at the time considers its biggest foundation. Losing spiritual connection isolates him, forcing to become an entity that brings about horror and pain to others. The reasons he does this all lead back to his own failure to save his love and, eventually himself.<br/><br/>Oldman is brilliant as the old vampire who schemes his way into London, and though his original intent is certainly beyond owning some pricey real estate, his ultimate goal is his reunion with his princess.

"Dhawley-2","5","3","5","25 October 2005"," An expensive, lavish failure
","Although this film was released 13 years ago, and has been reviewed to death, reading the fairly positive reviews prompted me to offer my own take. As a long-time horror movie fan (and having read countless horror novels, including Bram Stoker's book), I recall looking forward to seeing this film with great anticipation. What a let-down. Without going into a rehash of the film itself, I'll simply say that in spite of a big name director, big budget and 'A' list cast, this movie was among the worst Dracula movies ever made. Only a handful of atrocious 'Z' versions of the classic tale fare worse. Why? In a word, 'casting'. To those who thought it a good film, well, we all have our opinions. Having seen virtually every rendition of Dracula put to film, starting with Universal's Bela Lugosi version, this movie reeks. While I think Gary Oldman is a talented actor, he made a pitiful Dracula when in full vampire appearance. Winona Ryder was more irritating than intriguing; Anthony Hopkins turned in a version of Hannibal Lechtor as Van Helsing (even over-acting that persona), and Keanu Reeves (who I think has turned in some good performances in other films) was way out of place in this production. Some of the other supporting players were better, particularly Cary Elwes, Bill Campbell and the oh-so-hot Sadie Frost as Lucy Westenra. I also felt that the special effects were way over the top, and actually detracted from the sinister atmosphere, as good as they appeared on film. To me, this was a squandered opportunity. It could have been the definitive Dracula, but failed. For me, the two best Dracual versions ever put to film are (1) The Horror of Dracula, Hammer Film's 1958 remake with Christopher Lee, and (2) the BBC, made-for-television version starring Louis Jordan as the Count. It was certainly the most faithful to the book."
"pyrocitor","4","3","5","10 November 2004"," 'Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula' would be a more accurate title
","When an author's name is used in the title of a movie, we are lead to assume that the movie will be an adaptation of the author's original work. This usually signifies that the film will try to follow the story of the book faithfully, perhaps changing a few minor elements to make the transition to film easier to follow, but in general, staying true to the gist of the book. However, none of this at all applies to 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', which takes the title, characters and very basic plot elements from the novel, but not much else.<br/><br/>Director Francis Ford Coppola feels obliged to add a love plot between the title character and Mina Murray, who in the novel, he merely attempted to transform into a vampire alongside himself. Presumably, the idea was to give Dracula more to do, so the vampire isn't reduced to a supporting character, but the love plot doesn't work at all, and it is handled extremely awkwardly, making it completely uncredible as well as unlikely. (what could Mina possibly find appealing in a vampire trying to drain her blood to prolong his own miserable life even more?!) And why the decision for Dracula's vampire brides to be naked? They were far too creepy to seem appealing to the audience, and their entire scene seemed really out of place, and just badly done in general.<br/><br/>Many original elements from the book were absurdly overdone, such as Dracula turning into a beast,.(there was no need for him to transform as frequently as he did) Also, Dracula's moving shadow on the wall and the instantly changing hair colour of the supporting characters were laughable at best. It's true that the story focuses almost entirely on the four main characters, which is lucky, since it is impossible to sympathize in any way with the supporting characters such as Lord Holmwood and Quincey Morris, since their parts were so one dimensional and underdeveloped.<br/><br/>However, Coppola's biggest mistake was trying to make the audience sympathize with Dracula, with him wanting forgiveness from God after swearing vengeance on him thousands of years ago. Dracula is supposed to be the quintessential monster, we are supposed to hate him, and glorify in his death, not feel sorry for him. Trying to fit both elements into the same character just failed miserably.<br/><br/>The costumes in many cases were really quite ridiculous - when Dracula is first introduced as an old man, he is wearing a ludicrous red gown of some sort, and has his hair pulled into grotesque granny buns. How are we supposed to be intimidated by that? Later on, we find the dastardly vampire sporting John Lennon sunglasses, and a typical Johnny Depp hat. So now the vampire is going out of his way to start new fashion trends?! More unintentional laughs are now provoked.<br/><br/>Coppola did manage to secure a couple of good casting jobs, but the casting of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker has to be one of the most noticeable miscastings in film history, as Reeves gives one of his most wooden performances ever here, also showing that he cannot fake an accent to save his life, and has the entirely wrong look for the period. Reeves drags down the movie more than any of Coppola's directorial misfires could. Fortunately, Gary Oldman is excellent, engaging and charismatic as Dracula, if not quite as villainous as one would have hoped. Winona Ryder is another who at first glance appears to be miscast, but she actually turns out a decent performance, particularly in her scenes with Van Helsing. This is of course aided by the excellent casting of Anthony Hopkins, who is very suited to the role, although he played it much colder than the character in the novel, who was considerably more warm. Hopkins' Van Helsing is a no-nonsense, no time to waste, places to go, vampires to kill kind of guy. Tom Waits also stands out as raving lunatic Renfield, one of his strongest acting performances to date.<br/><br/>It is an insult to Bram Stoker's novel just by naming the movie after it, as it would be even if Coppola's adaptation had been done well. So many changes were made to the plot that the movie has very little in common with Stoker's book. If the film had been titled 'Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula' we would have a better idea of what to expect. Although, Coppola doesn't deserve much critical acclaim for the multiple directorial misfires he makes here. In Coppola's defense, he was probably trying to put his own spin on the tale, to leave his mark and offer a different take on the novel. But surely there were better possibilities for the film than this one.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Gothic Horror movies are probably my favorite genre, so it was a terrible shock to see a fine story turned into a soft porn movie. The movie wasn't even centered on Stoker's book but on the tired old lost love plotline. There were several characters with similar names to those in the book but usually not doing the same things. The film seemed to concentrate on scantily clad women panting and even sex with a wolf. Any character development or fun action sequences were shown at high speed in a blurry montage , and then back to more sex. Even the man himself, Count Dracula, first appears dressed as an old circus clown,or aging D.C. Comics Superhero, then later as a 70,s John Lennon. Not even any dignity for him.YUK!

Gary Oldman was doing his sleepwalking act again - glower glower, sneer sneer, yada yada. Winona was, as usual, truly irritating as only she can be - but I give her credit for going well with the decor. Hopkins has been much lowered in my esteem, and Sadie Frost made me cringe. (Let's not talk about Keanu. It's just too painful.)<br/><br/>Even the much-praised visuals weren't all that spectacular. There were some unforgettable moments, filmed with great imagination and style; but also the unmistakable look of the soundstage that clashed rather horribly with the feel of the film. In terms of production style, lavish and decadent would have to be the words of the day; but again, the feeling of artificialty overpowered.<br/><br/>Finally, its status as a horror film. There are certain characteristics of Gothic horror films that have, through long and exhaustive use, become passe - the strategic lightning and thunderclap; the walking-around-mysterious-corners-at-night; the rising storm; and the little things like rats and worms. The challenge for modern horror films is rise above these cliches, to come up with something new and different to challenge the audience.<br/><br/>Not only does Dracula not avoid these cliches, it positively takes a running jump, clutches them in its scaly embrace and slowly sucks the life out. The dialogue was in a similar vein. It was shocking, but in a totally negative way.<br/><br/>To sum up - don't see it."

","Simply in terms of fidelity to the original material, Bram Stoker's classic story of 'Dracula', Francis Ford Coppola has made a hashish smoker's ideal adaptation of a story that could have been truly horrifying by being realistic. What we have here is a Playboy version for adolescent adults (and real adolescents) who are dazzled by anachronistic costuming and hairstyles and bits and pieces of carnival sideshow trickery.<br/><br/>There is much that is beautiful in this film, notably the musical score by Wojciech Kilar and Michael Ballhaus's cinematography. The set designs for Dracula's Transylvanian castle are fascinating in a sort of Edward Gory-esquire way but not at all scarifying. The back lot sets for Victorian London are equally fake-looking but nicely detailed and well-populated with immaculate extras all acting like perfect ladies and gentlemen. A far cry from the real streets of 19th century London. This is another studio bound evocation of a period, as in Tim Burton's flop 'Sweeney Todd', which would have made Mary Poppins feel right at home.<br/><br/>The cast has difficulties mostly due to the sophomoric script. Only Gary Oldman (Dracula), Anthony Hopkins (Van Helsing) and, surprisingly, Tom Waits (Renfrew) are able to deliver potent performances with the words provided.<br/><br/>Some people don't like Gary Oldman's Dracula. I do, very much. He rises above the defeating script to deliver at times a powerfully touching portrait of a tragic man. Whether the character he plays is authentically Stoker's is not Oldman's fault. He does his very best and for him alone I keep returning, periodically, to watch this adult fairy tale.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is quite weird and spooky as Van Helsing, scarier than Dracula to my way of thinking. The shade of Hannibal Lecter, which he filmed the year before this role, is ever- present in his threatening and eccentric man of science. But Hopkins doesn't appear to be taking this role seriously. He's camping it up throughout.<br/><br/>Tom Waits' insane Renfrew has entered the annals as one of the most memorable bizarre characters on screen, right up there with Jack Nicholson's Joker in 'Batman' and Klaus Kinski's Dracula in Werner Herzog's 'Nosferatu' (now THAT is one frightening and creepy movie).<br/><br/>I also enjoyed Sadie Frost's Lucy. This character, as interpreted by Coppola, is completely out of place, far too modern and slutty, especially for a well-brought up English maiden of the aristocracy. And where could she have come up with the red, dominatrix teddy she wears to her first encounter with Dracula at the bottom of the garden? The original Victoria's Secret? Her costumes are totally ridiculous, if gorgeous, but she looks wonderful in them and goes with the flow, turning in the most camp and over-the-top performance of the entire cast. <br/><br/>Cary Elwes is a total stick as Lucy's fiancé but, again, not his fault; it's the lame script which reduces him to human wallpaper. I liked Bill Campbell's Quincy, the handsome, sexy Texan, but there is something a bit too cartoony about his character. But, this is a human cartoon version of this story so his Quincey doesn't seem so very out of place. Normally I enjoy Richard E. Grant, who plays the morphine addicted student doctor who runs the insane asylum, a place that he belongs in himself, but not as the manager. Again, a fine actor is reduced to stock melodramatics in the face of the fatuous script.<br/><br/>Worst of all are the two romantic leads, Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder. They are both stiff and self-conscious, as they attempt to spit out their ideas of upper crust English accents and in the process crippling what little acting ability either of them ever possessed in the first place. They look beautiful, especially him, but they are painful to watch and, especially, listen to. Why does Winona Ryder slur her 'S's all the time? She sounds slightly drugged when she does this and it's terrificly annoying.<br/><br/>Coppola has now retired to the vineyard in Napa County from where he sententiously pronounces on the imminent demise of Hollywood, and appears to have made his last movie, at least for the moment. If so, he will go down in celluloid history as having been a four flick phenomenon, 'The Conversation', 'The Godfather' (I & II) and 'Apocalypse Now'. This would be tragic if he were a great auteur who shunned the public eye, but he's not and he doesn't.<br/><br/>A disappointing director, all in all, as proved by his over-bearing and self-indulgent work in this 'Dracula' which smacks of amateurishness and too much ganja at the planning stage. He and Reeves and Ryder deserved one another, but the rest of his fine cast is criminally wasted.<br/><br/>But I repeat, Gary Oldman is fantastic as Dracula and worth seeing. He deserves another shot at this role in a faithful, realistic adaptation, and without the silly wig he is made to wear in Castle Dracula, but it will never happen now.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good, modern vampire movie, try Herzog's 'Nosferatu' or Tony Scott's 'The Hunger' or Neil Jordan's 'Interview with the Vampire' or, best of all in spite of the awful dubbing, Tomas Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In'. All of them succeed where Coppola fails."

","This could have been the defining ""Dracula"" movie, but like many Hollywood movies, it took the low road. Too much focus on sex, and capturing the all important 18-40 demographic led to this movie's demise. First, let's start with the casting. When will people learn that Keanu Reeves should NEVER be cast in anything but surfer dude roles. His performance was so bland, and his ""accent"" so phony, I can't help but wonder if this is the same director that gave us ""The Godfather"" Second, Wynona Ryder is not much better, sorry folks. Her accent is barely passable, and she doesn't really seem right for the part either. (How about casting some British actors for the British characters?) <br/><br/>The movie does start strong in terms of storytelling, showing us the back story of the Dracula legend, with Gary Oldman as Vlad Dracul (or Tepes) the Romanian knight who goes off to war to fight the invading Muslim armies. After returning victorious, he is crushed to learn that his wife has committed suicide on the false information that he was killed in battle. Renouncing God, Vlad vows to fight for the powers of darkness, etc etc. <br/><br/>Fast forward 400 years, and Jonathan Harker, solicitor (Reeves) arrives to help a weird looking, ancient, Romanian Count (Dracula) purchase some property in London. What the costume designers and more importantly the hairstylists were thinking when they came up with this is anyone's guess. While Dracula is a creepy character, it goes completely over the top with the ridiculous hairstyle they give Drac. After some strange goings on, Harker realizes he is being help prisoner in Drac's castle, while Drac travels to London to seduce Harkers fiancée Mina, (Ryder) who is a dead ringer for Drac's late wife. <br/><br/>Needless to say, lots of sexual situations and ""erotic"" scenes ensue, with hammy acting on all accounts, especially from Anthony Hopkins (in the quasi comic relief character of Dr. Van Helsing, vampire hunter) The movie just never really realizes the potential the material has. Instead of making an ""erotic thriller"" , they should have tried making a scary vampire movie. (The novel does have enough material to do that) It's a shame this movie never lives up to it's potential, but that's Hollywood..."

","Dracula is the result of the melding of history and fiction, taking the story of Vlad the Impaler and adding it to the novel ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker, with a little bit of romance stirred in to add body to a one-dimensional plot. If you need to know more, glance at stamper's review.<br/><br/>The only believable acting in this film is provided by Gary Oldman, as the title character, and Winona Rider, as his love reincarnate. Oldman provides humanity and personality to his character, and unlike some of the other accents presented in the film, sounds somewhat believable. When Ryder plays opposite to him, it is very reminiscent of her work in Edward Scissorhands, which works beautifully in this context, even if it feels a little forced.<br/><br/>When these two step on screen, it's easy to forget about the other actors in the film. Though Sadie Frost's Lucy is believable and provides some of the little energy in the film, she is merely a plot device. Anthony Hopkins has little stage presence, and his character is so completely inconsistent that he takes an already iffy character and elevates it to new heights. The three loves of Frost's character, played by Cary Elwes, Bill Campbell and Tom Waits, meld as one persona, merely divided by the three accents. And as for Keanu Reeves, you could get greater expression and emotion out of a cardboard cutout. He could be ravished by three vampiresses or be talking to his wife, Ryder, and it is all the same for him.<br/><br/>The writing, at least, was well done. The love story is well developed, and though the opening is a little silly and melodramatic, when the lovers reunite all is good and the audience can feel the couple's struggle. The set design was true to the novel, and the makeup job on Oldman is superb. However, the visuals don't save what is basically a so-so film."

","I have an astonishing confession to make: I have never actually read the book written by Bram Stoker. However, I do have a vague idea of how the story goes. There's this alarmingly mysterious character that lives in a castle in Transylvania who goes by Count Dracula. He possessed some dude he met named Renfield to secretly find some victims with fresh, delicious blood and to eat nothing but insects and thrive on their souls. Dracula picks the wrong girl to bite (Lucy) and after her health and behavior become questionable (along with Renfield's actions), her peers seek the help of Professor Van Helsing, not a Broadway-loving Australian but a doctor who specializes in the abnormal. Lucy dies and rises again as a bloodsucker, only to be murdered again by the VH crew. Van Helsing says she was the victim of a vampire and that the ringleader of the vampires must be killed for this chaos to end. They figure out it's Dracula, and after a heated battle, a stake is driven through Dracula's heart, thus putting an end to his terrorizing, and everybody else live happily ever after. (I'd like to thank my clearest source, the Mel Brooks film Dracula: Dead and Loving It.) This film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, succeeds in educating the audience about the mostly unmentioned, and therefore unknown, elements of the story, but its weakness of containing a mostly undevoted, undedicated, and cluelessly unaware cast damn near overpowers any knowledge that can be learned by having the audience focus on glaring errors rather than interesting tidbits.<br/><br/>The most horrible work is brought to the table by that often-mocked thespian Keanu Reeves. The man of ""Whoa!"" plays Jonathan Harker, an Englishman who takes it upon himself to investigate Dracula's castle and is held captive for quite a while. Read that sentence again. Keanu Reeves plays an Englishman. Imagine Reeves not even trying to discipline his surfer ways and deliver lines in a British dialect. Now multiply that monstrosity by two, and you have his laughable performance. Still can't imagine it? Read this line aloud: ""I've seen where the bawsterd sleeps!"" Also, I suppose out of fright and terror, Harker's hair turns white, which looks ridiculous with Reeves' golden tanned face. In Reeves' defense, I will say this: These days, he has at least shown a little improvement in his movies since Dracula.<br/><br/>To be blunt, the actors that disappointed me a bit more than Keanu were the dread pirate Cary Elwes (as one of three guys who wanted to get in bed with Lucy) and respected Oscar-winning thespian Sir Anthony Hopkins, who played Van Helsing. Before I dis Elwes' performance, I will say he has done much worse (see Saw), but Dracula is another example of his bad habit of overacting from time to time. Perhaps he was trying to upstage the other two horndogs after Lucy; ultimately, none of the three are interesting in the least. As for Hopkins, he disappoints his new found fans from his first go at Hannibal Lector by taking a juicy role like Van Helsing and sleep-acting throughout the film.<br/><br/>The best performance of the film belongs to Gary Oldman (surprise, surprise) as the title role. His dialect actually sounds Transylvanian, as opposed to Bela Lugosi's more famous Hungarian dialect, and he brings the perfect doses of sensuality and blasphemous vengeance to the role. My favorite scene is in the beginning, when the not yet undead Dracula, a warrior returning from battle, finds his love (Winona Ryder, briefly playing Elisabeta) has committed suicide and takes the matter personally, in powerful anger, with God. Oldman, through an odd mix of hatred and sympathy, has the audience eating from the palm of his hand from that point on, and he delivers his tortured lines in another language! Watching the movie, I actually felt sorry that the phenomenal actor put more thought, research, and heart into the film than anybody else in the cast and the director did. Had this been a better movie, Oldman would have better roles on his resume and more nominations under his belt.<br/><br/>Tom Waits, who plays bug-munching Renfield, is always delightfully mad fun, but I wish he had more scenes. As for Ryder, her Mina participates in some great seductive chemistry with Oldman, but her scenes with Keanu slump in appeal. Finally, Sadie Frost, who does a fine job of moaning, rubbing herself, and showing her bare chest as Lucy, would have had a great career in porn after this movie if she had pursued it - too bad I don't remember or recognize anything else she has done (I know, I know; she was married to Jude Law once. So what?).<br/><br/>Oscars were received for the costumes and sound editing, and while the costumes were creative and colorful, they did not seem to match the realism the film was going for. The award-winning makeup for the vampires was absolutely astounding and reminded me of much later creatures made for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. On the other hand, to make the film all the more uneven, the visual effects and set design were sadly dated, relying on tricks from the '60s, like black silhouettes battling in front of a red-lit backdrop. Overall, the movie is heavily weighted down by its faults, but thanks to Oldman, this bat is still barely in flight."

","What makes this version of Dracula so outstanding is the profound emptiness at the center of the vampire's heart. His many guises-- the werewolf, the bat, the beast-man, the toothy old man, the courtly suitor, etc.-- reveal the absence of any one true self. While skilled and seasoned by the passing of the centuries, Dracula lacks a center. In 1462, he looses his cardinal virtue by desecrating his own god (Christ), and so he comes to London (in 1892) attempting to fill the void in himself by finding the reincarnation of his lost love. Oldman's Dracula is both a master manipulator of character and circumstance, and, at the same time, a highly emotive and reactive persona. His thirst for blood does not come from some biological nuance (as is often peddled to us by the trendy, scientistic wave of the Blade-ish, neo-vampire garbage). It is the insatiable thirst for a past that he cannot retrieve, or better, a past that he has only this one chance to retrieve via Mina-Elizabeta. Thus, the irony of this version of Dracula is that if Dracula had actually been graced with Mina's hand in the end, he would have surely ceased to be a killer."

","Here's a question from the Cultural Aptitude Test. Warren Spahn is to Casey Stengel as Tom Waits is to ........??? Warren Spahn pitched for Casey Stengel in the 1940's for some woeful Boston Braves teams in the years before Mathews and Aaron showed up. He also pitched for Casey in the 1960's for some woeful Mets teams in the days before Tom Seaver showed up. In between, from 1949 to 1960, Casey won ten pennants in twelve years, including five consecutive World Series. Spahnie was fond of pointing out that he was the only man who worked for Casey before and after he was a genius. My analogy doesn't work perfectly for Tom Waits and Francis Ford Coppola, because the chronology is off. Waits never worked in Coppola's pre-Godfather movies, but he worked in some when Coppola's genius seemed to be in remission. Most glaringly, he was Renfield in Dracula.<br/><br/>What a disappointment it must have been for Coppola to read the reviews of this movie. He was a certified genius, he got enough money to make a comeback big-budget movie, and this is what he churned out. Don't think the movie is without value. If you nominated this as the most visually splendid movie in your knowledge, I would not dispute that at all. The recreations of Gothic Transylvania and Gaslit Victorian London are splendid - sometimes beautiful, sometimes chilling. But what possessed him to cast this cast?<br/><br/>First there is Dracula. Let's see, we need the most over-the-top actor in the business. Shatner is too old and fat, and Larry Storch is too silly - how about Gary Oldman? His movements and monologues are so exaggerated and campy as to make Burt Ward look like a master of subtlety. I laughed out loud several times when I watched the tape, especially when he took Keanu's shaving razor and licked the blood off of it. Tom Waits, the skid row Sinatra, matches Oldman measure for measure, an overacting symphony unmatched since Shatner himself  went toe-to-toe with Montalban in The Wrath of Khan. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is equally atrocious. Keanu Reeves is Harker, the brilliant young London attorney. OK, let's pause on that one. You want to cast an actor who can be convincing as a brilliant young 19th century attorney, and you want him to speak with an aristocratic accent from Victorian London? Who would you hire? I'll bet not one of you out there would have been stupid enough to hire Keanu Reeves, but that's exactly who the genius Coppola came up with. Cary Elwes was right there on the set, in the cast in a minor part, and could easily have handled Harker in a workmanlike and professional way, but no-o-o-o-o, get me Keanu.  ""Whoa, bitchin', vampire-dude!""<br/><br/>And what was the deal with that Cowboy guy? ""Now jes' hold on there, Dracula, you orn'rey sidewindin' bloodsuckin' whippersnapper, or I'll blast ya to kingdom come, pardner"".<br/><br/>You know what happened, don't you? It was the emperor's new clothes. Hundreds of smart people involved in the movie knew it was full of malarkey and they knew exactly why, but nobody had the chutzpah to look the great genius in the eye and say so. Who could presume to question the guy who did ""Apocalypse Now""? Same thing happened to Tarkovsky when he made ""Nostalghia"".<br/><br/>The plot centers around Dracula's search for the reincarnation of his centuries-ago true love. Of course, he was looking a little better back in the 1400's, when she committed suicide, thinking him dead. A sweet love story amid the Gothic wreckage? Phantom of the Soap Opera? Well, I suppose Winona isn't going to get a lot of action from Keanu Reeves, so why not take on Drac?<br/><br/>The movie won the great genius three statuettes, for things like make up and costumes and sound effects. Talk about damning with faint praise. How many sleepless nights have you passed wondering who would win the Oscar for best Sound Effects Editing?<br/><br/>I could have forgiven the comic opera acting because of the movie's strengths, but the movie had one unforgiveable element. It is boring. Tedious. Seems infinitely long. Stylish, but not scary. In the entertainment field, boredom is the only true sin. I loved the first 15 minutes, then I had to fight off sleep except during the unintentionally comic interludes. My friend Count Floyd sent over these tips for you youngsters who want to make scary monster chiller horror films (1) Speeches aren't scary (2) Monsters that can be clearly seen and defined aren't scary. People fear the unknown, the unseen, the shadowy, the unexplained. When you show things too clearly, they start to seem familiar, or comical, or trite."

This makes it seem very real and quite true to the original story. The plot is almost exactly the same as the original book, and it keeps the interest pretty good, though the movie is a little slow. The acting is very good, good performances by all the actors. This is probably because most of them are big names; Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins. The special effects are pretty good, even though the film is over a decade old, the effects don't seem dated. The cinematography is also very good, sometimes even fantastic.

Although the gall of such claims is insulting, unfaithfulness to the book isn't necessarily problematic. Having seen a bunch of Dracula movies since reading the novel, I'd probably agree with others that the 1977 TV-movie ""Count Dracula"" is the most ""faithful"" screen adaptation; it's also not especially good. Far better to interpret one or a few major themes, or to create your own, than to slavishly render another story's details. That said, Coppola's ""Dracula"" does include many of Stoker's details, as well as material from prior Dracula films and even adds a few things itself, but its main concept or reinterpretation of the story is stupid. They made the Gothic horror novel into a reincarnation romance, and even that is unoriginal (it's lifted from the 1974 TV movie of the same name). Nevertheless, the excessive style and sometimes-brisk pacing helps adapt and update the long-winded Victorian-age novel to postmodern cinema. It also brings the story's sex to the forefront, and the inclusion of the invention of film is apt.<br/><br/>In the novel, Van Helsing only briefly suggests that Dracula could be the historical Vlad the Impaler, and Stoker was only partially inspired by the historical figure--not even researching him enough to locate Dracula in his real country of Wallachia instead of Transylvania. Never mind, movies like this one have blown this connection up beyond any resemblance to Stoker's fiction or Vlad's historicity. Here, Vlad's fictional wife is tricked into suicide, and Vlad renounces God in an outlandish scene of sacrilege, which says more about the filmmakers turning away from the faith in Stoker's book than it does about the character of Dracula. In the rest of the film, after all, crucifixes are easily dispensed with by the vampires, and only Van Helsing makes a few passing references to the holy war that consumed Stoker's verbiage. Fair enough, this is hardly the first irreligious Dracula movie.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman's Transylvanian Count, with wig and playful shadow, is ripe for parody, and, indeed, he inspires some of the best gags in Mel Brooks's ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" (1995). The make-up and visual-effects crews did a bang-up job with the gross-out views of a weird, non-Stoker variety of Dracula's transformations: from ancient undead, to cocoon state, to sex-crazed werewolf, to plain-ole wolf, to ugly melting-face crybaby, to giant batman, to rats. The very-non-Stoker, good-looking Dracula is different. He's not sociable enough to be in the Bela Lugosi suave-vampire tradition; he's more of a flaneur or dandy type, with the top hat and sunglasses, lurking about crowds and being a force of surveillance. Oldman mumbles and slurs his lines (""the children of the night"" one was particularly flubbed), but, at least, he seems to have attempted an accent, which is more than can be said of the rest of the cast. For a story mostly set in England, its most-prominent British stars (Oldman and Anthony Hopkins) play the leading foreigners, while two North Americans (Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves) play the lead English characters. At this rate, they should've got a Continental European to play the Texan Quincy. And musician Tom Waits must be a reference to the film's music-video stylization; otherwise, his Renfield is pointless, and his metal gloves and the box-cage helmets for the asylum guards are just bizarre.<br/><br/>While Dracula is ruined by turning into a sympathetic, reluctant, lovesick crybaby of a vampire, Van Helsing is made more fun this time by turning more devilish. He's a ""sick old buzzard,"" as Quincy quips, after he humps Quincy's leg while remaking on the late Lucy's wantonness. For Mina, Van Helsing eyeballs her up and down, sniffs her and forces her to dance with him upon first meeting; later, he's eager to have sex with her before the vampirism gets in the way. I'm all for this interpretation of the Dutch doctor. His lecture in his first scene on syphilis also exposes the vampirism-as-venereal-disease subtext of Stoker's tale and casts this adaptation as a sexual struggle, in addition to the regrettable reincarnation romance.<br/><br/>Lucy's the whore; Mina's the Madonna--at least in Dracula's eyes. For all its sex, like most Dracula movies, this one is more regressive in its depiction of women than Stoker's 19th-Century novel. Whereas Mina was the primary hero for Stoker and his surrogate storyteller--compiling the diary entries, journals, letters, etc., that comprised the book's epistolary structure--, here, she spies for the vampire (same thing happened in the sexist 1979 ""Dracula""). In one of the vestigial devices carried over from the book's narration to this film, the last journal voiceover is that of Jonathan, not Mina. Meanwhile, Mina's struggle with unfaithfulness is summarized in her horrendous love scene with Drac, where she hits him for murdering Lucy, which, then, cuts to Van Helsing and the boys burning stuff, before cutting back to Mina now, laughably, pawing Drac and begging him to do her.<br/><br/>That they display the early-cinema show complete with stag films, a train film on a loop, battle-scene puppetry and a poster for a passion play picture also speaks to the film's incongruity. Ditto the early-cinema-styled shot earlier, which renders people's movements overly jerky. Oddly, Dracula is the one who praises the science of cinema, whereas Mina mocks it. This figures with the rest of the filmmakers' mishandling of Stoker's novel. Stoker's ancient Dracula was defeated because the humans used then-new technologies, including blood transfusions and trains, which this film keeps, and Mina's typewriter, which is just a prop here. Adding cinema to the list of new technologies was apt, especially for a screen adaptation, but making it the province of a shades-wearing vamp is to misunderstand the source.<br/><br/>Stylistically, this Dracula is all over the place, too, but, at least, the pure excess, the sometimes-frenzied cutting and swinging camerawork keep the pacing brisk, as though the filmmakers themselves ingested some of Dracula's absinthe or Seward's morphine. I prefer it to the romance, which tends to grind the plot to a halt. Take the ending, where we must endure strung-out testaments of love between Mina and the dying Dracula. ""Our love is stronger than death,"" Mina bellows, as I barf. Seriously, why must so many Hollywood movies reduce everything to their infantile notions of love?<br/><br/>(Mirror Note: Dracula's non-reflection in Harker's shaving mirror is standard, but his lack of one from a storefront window, as he stalks Mina, is a rare touch of subtlety.)"

","Being someone who reads (or read) a lot, I feel bad about not having read the original Dracula novel. It makes it hard for me to determine whether or not certain films are direct retellings of the original or completely new stories. As I've seen the famous Bela Lugosi version, this seemed to follow the same plot as that one. Of course, when you have something as big as Dracula, you can't help but know a bit of the story. This is most likely the best Dracula movie I've ever seen. I remember how the hairdo was parodied in a ""Treehouse Of Horror"" episode of ""The Simpsons"". It's a shame that just disappears thirty-six minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>I had no idea Anthony Hopkins was in this movie and boy, does he do an amazing job! I loved him as Van Helsing and appreciated how all of these characters had such unique personalities. I didn't even recognize Keanu Reeves! It's great to have so many beloved actors in a movie. I was surprised at how sexual and bloody this film was. It really does seem like a whole new take on Dracula. The first five minutes are the best as it actually explains his origin. It's a short scene, but dang, is it poetic. I thought this would be longer, but I think the length was perfect. I just love the atmosphere, the bright colors, the costumes, it's a wonderful film. ***1/2"
"PinkfishPirates","6","2","3","16 March 2016"," Keanu ""Doing"" An English Accent Is Simply Hilarious
","Don't get me wrong this film will appeal to a lot of people, compared to other vampire films this is definitely up there, but that's like winning first prize at an ugly contest. What is great about this film is the drama and theater style applied from the director and set designers. However the cast choice is simply wrong, Keanu is a great actor, but not capable of an English accent. At this early stage in his career all I see when I watch this movie is Bill and Ted coming through in his voice and mannerisms. I end up laughing at him dealing with an English accent which doesn't really help put the fear of Dracula into me. Its a great film but for me it borders on being a comedy due to this. Many I am sure will completely disagree. If you want a classic refined British accent hire an actor from classic British decent, instead of stoner Ted Theodor Logan :)"

"nikozwan","7","2","3","14 November 2014"," A beautiful mess
","This movie is very hard to pinpoint. Like somebody pointed out, the actors are pretty terrible. Or rather, they're a good bunch of actors but they don't do very well. Then we have Mr. Coppola who don't really seem to know what to do with his script. Parts of the movie are scary, parts are campy. There's a very erotic undertone that I don't get from the book.<br/><br/>The movie starts out pretty strong, then gets lost for a good deal of time. When Van Helsing arrives, it regains some of its momentum. The ending was pretty strong, although I personally did not like the actual resolution of the film.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was an interesting watch. Time has been surprisingly kind to Dracula. Cinematography, one of Coppola's strong suits, was again phenomenal. He also uses some very interesting techniques that remind us from old b/w classics. Staccato POV shots and obsolete cameras add to the splendid mess that makes this movie a Part of Horror History.<br/><br/>That being said, I think that the time is ripe for a remake that is more aligned with Stoker's book."

","Some mind-bogglingly bad performances have been captured on film. Exhibit A: Al Pacino's laugh-out-loud performance in the notoriously overrated SCARFACE. ""Who joo talking to...?"" Exhibit B: Martin Landau's who-gives-a-f*** turn as Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD. Exhibit C: Nicole ""You gotta be kiddin' me"" Kidman in COLD MOUNTAIN (or whatever it was called). Exhibit D: EVERYBODY in DICK TRACY (ESPECIALLY Madonna and Warren Beatty). Exhibit E: Jeff Bridges in the American remake of THE VANISHING. I could go on (and on and on; this's an EASY one, once you get started), but time's a'wastin'. I'm here to talk about Gary Oldman in ""BRAM STOKER'S"" Dracula. (Wynona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were TRYING, damn it, though Anthony Hopkins just phoned it in- again...) Oldman's mangling of whatever accents he was attempting is hilarious to watch: he may well have had a mouthful of marbles (it would explain a lot). The movie LOOKS great, but there are times when Looks just ain't enough. THIS is one of them times. Rewriting Stoker is never a good idea; filmmakers do so at their own peril. The ""origin"" story of Dracula, lifted from the black and white Dracula LIVES! Marvel Comics magazine, adds little to the film (well, it extends the running time, but that's about all). Next time around (and there WILL be a next time; you can count on it), maybe it'd be a good idea to just do it By The Book. And, while I'm at it, whoever's up next with an attempt at a theatrical version of Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND should get a copy of HIS script for same from Gauntlet Press; it sure as s*** couldn't hurt..."
"HelenMary","7","2","3","5 December 2012"," Dracula epic film, faithful to the brilliant Bram Stoker classic
","Coppola's film tackled the original story so well, the book being one of my favourites of all time. Written entirely through the medium of letters and journal entries, it is an intimate tale that is spine chilling in it's intensity. It doesn't rely on gratuitous frighteners, but plays on all our deepest darkest fears, the things that go bump in the night and not being safe anywhere against this kind of threat, and losing our mortal souls.<br/><br/>The film captured the feel and nature of the book well. With Gary Oldman in the titular role - a very talented actor - and he played it elegantly and with a lot of style. Winona Ryder played Mina/Elisabeta, his star-crossed lover. I've always admired her and she suited the period nature of this film, and I liked the semblance of innocence in her way of playing her character compared to her worldly friend Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost). There's a lot that was a little cheesy, and the acting wasn't the best - everyone seemed to play it a little hammy. Much was made of some of the English accents in the film (ie how bad they were) by Reeves and Ryder but I'm afraid I judge the Director for not picking up on them. There's a lot that's a bit silly in the film, and the accents weren't the worst of it. Even the great Hopkins (Helsing) was touched by the silly-stick and played up his role to the nines. In short it certainly wasn't a dry production as he also ramped up the arrogance and insanity of his role too. <br/><br/>At the time of release much was also made of the bestiality scene between Dracula in his wolfman form and Lucy in the garden, I have to say she was brave to take on that! It's shocking, a little, the first time you see it but it's really not bad. The famous Renfield (Tom Waits) was cringeworthily gross, as the craven and mad slave of Dracula. Reeves as the long-suffering Jonathan Harker was not at his best in this, but how do you research walking into a client's home to find he's crazy beehive haired vampire? He comes across out of his depth in this, and I don't know why. He's well cast as Harker, though, he suits the period gentility and properness exceedingly well, but perhaps he was playing up his discomfiture about his character's predicament (justified!) - especially finding himself in bed with three blood-smeared wenches! <br/><br/>So much of this film was great, though, despite the over-the-top acting, laughable at times, but it works.Very well. This story is frightening, but it's not in the way that typical horror movies are, and the humour helps you manage it, but there is also intense love and seduction in this story; it is mainly a love story after all. The poignant scene where Mina meets Dracula and a wolf escaped from the zoo walks in... lovely. So much deeper than cheap horror. <br/><br/>Victorian sensibility had the Vampire at odds with God, his immortal soul lost to salvation. Prior to Stoker vampires were vile loathsome creatures but he made them magical illusory and a seductive beauty who tempted impressionable young ladies into his eternal death. The film gives room for the spiritual morality tale, accurately and with a sense of the hugeness of what it represented; Vlad Dracula turning his back on God as he felt he had been abandoned after losing his love. Finally, the music used in the film was very good - Love Song for a Vampire by Annie Lennox was superb - and the costumes were stunning, particularly the dresses Winona Ryder got to wear. It's a beautiful film, if you see past the dripping yowling toothy wenches and Monica Bellucci stealing babies."
"henryonhillside","8","2","3","1 March 2011"," Excellent
","It's not really Bram Stoker's Dracula, it's Coppola's Dracula, plus Oldman and Hopkins, and that's plenty. Lots of blood; more would have been better (I guess they wanted the R rating rather than X; too bad). Oldman is superb. Hopkins is funky, funny, eccentric, excellent. Ryder - well, I actually think they should have made her into a cousin visiting from America, and told her to drop the English accent entirely, because the accent is atrocious, and comes close to sinking every scene she's in. The costuming is stunning. Coppola's direction is very fine, with a few bumps here and there. I might just add that Coppola's commentary on the DVD is flat, bored-sounding, and almost entirely lacking in cool details - unusual for him and quite disappointing."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","2","3","23 May 2010"," Visually audacious, eerie and operatic version of the undead legend
","There were several reasons why I wanted to see Bram Stoker's Dracula, and after seeing the film finally I was really impressed. No seriously I was. It is not perfect, but on the whole it is very well done.<br/><br/>I have read Bram Stoker's book several times and love it to death, it is rich in detail, it is haunting and it is shocking. This film is not the truest film version of the book, and that's putting it mildly, but it is one of the more visually beautiful and intriguing ones. That is no way a flaw, I am not the sort of person who says if this adaptation is untrue to the book I pan it, or at least I try not to. Speaking of flaws there are two significant flaws, one is more significant than the other, that stop the film from perfection. At over two hours the film is probably a little too long. But the biggest problem is Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker. I know it is not old news to rag on Reeves's performance, and I will say I am not a fan of his, sure he has been in some very good films but he is nearly always one of the weaker assets which is exactly the case here. Jonathan Harker is an estate agent who is threatened by Dracula, but I found Reeves's acting far too too inept, flat and emotionless, complete with a very unimpressive accent. For instance, when he says ""Oh, I'm very sorry""- Keanu I know there aren't many ways to say that phrase strictly speaking, but do actually try to sound as though you're sorry.<br/><br/>Flaws aside, Francis Ford Coppola's film is very, very good. It is eerie, it is romantic and it is even operatic. For one thing, it is exquisitely mounted, very grandiose in its visual approach. From the sumptuous costumes, the lovingly crafted settings, the superb make up and the basic yet atmospheric lighting complete with more sophisticated techniques it is a feast for the eyes. Another strength is the score, it was very like an opera, rich, soulful, haunting and melancholic. I also liked the script, it was poetic, it was intelligent and it was sophisticated, and the plot is coherent with some effective scenes such as Mina following Lucy into the garden when Lucy is later attacked by Dracula. And the direction is wonderful, a lot of fashioned touches are made to make this film very watchable at least once.<br/><br/>With the exception of Reeves, the acting is very good. Winona Ryder is an improvement certainly, she is beautiful and intense thus she becomes the object of Dracula's devastating desire. Her chemistry with Reeves wasn't quite there, but with Gary Oldman it was pretty much smouldering. Anthony Hopkins was one of the main reasons why I wanted to see this film in the first place, he is a brilliant actor, one of the best there is actually. See him in The Elephant Man, Shadowlands, Howards' End and the Remains of the Day, all wonderful films, and he is impeccable in all of them. I enjoyed him here, here he plays Dr Van Helsing, a famed doctor who dares to believe in Dracula and in the end even dares to confront him, and gives a delicious performance making the most of some inventive one-liners. Richard E.Grant, Cary Elwes and Bill Campbell all give great support, but it is Gary Oldman's towering performance as Dracula that dominates the film. An excellent, underrated actor(Immortal Beloved is just living proof of his talent), Oldman is menacing, suave, handsome, charismatic, tragic and just amazing here, his transitions from old to young and from man to beast are completely believable, in short it was one of the more interesting interpretations of Dracula. Also look out for Monica Belluci as one of Dracula's wives, she is breathtakingly beautiful, even Sadie Frost was surprisingly good as Lucy.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want a faithful adaptation of the book, you may be disappointed. However, if you want a visually stunning, richly scored and compelling movie this is perfect for you. Regardless of how it deviates from the book, I liked it a lot, and would definitely see it again. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"rdmingham","5","2","3","10 September 2009"," A terrifying epic novel torn apart
","I will not say too much on this title. Just 2 good points and 2 bad points.<br/><br/>Good point 1 - The story sticks very rigidly to the original novel...aside from the romance between Dracula and Mina. It truly got horribly annoying to watch this film, especially so soon after reading the book. Because of it, the character of Mina was completely....COMPLETELY destroyed and changed!!! In fact, her role was swapped for Dracula's. He seems good, and you can empathise with him in it!! Obscene!!! I guess this is now a 3rd bad point and now we are down to one good point. (best to save best until last so the 2 bad points now).<br/><br/>Bad point no 1 (or 2) - The film seems to have been made too dramatic...too much of the 'in-your-face' music, too much fast paced cinematic devices with the camera. Just treat the material with respect and let it tell the story for itself.<br/><br/>Final Bad point - KEANU REEVES!!!!! I'd like to just leave it there, but that would be unfair. I must give my reasons....firstly, his over played British accent (take it easy!!) that continually slips into American on words that I guess don't normally have a heavy British inflexion (short words at the end of the sentence for example). And also his diabolical acting. 2 examples, his reaction when seeing Dracula for the 1st time in London, and also his pleading with Mina when on the ship (he really doesn't seem too worried).<br/><br/>Only Good Point - Anthony Hopkins. By far the best Van Helsing I have ever seen act. Completely eccentric, but believably a genius. Hell bent on a righteous path, seemingly as a madman mostly, but there are points in time throughout the movie that reveal his character as caring, genuine, honourable and true. A gentleman on a divine mission"
"LukeBHoopes","3","2","3","20 April 2008"," I love horror movies, but I HATE Dracula
","Okay, I like horror movies don't get me wrong, but this movie just didn't interest me. There was a lot of violence and sexuality which are strong points in the movie that grab my attention. But with this it is Dracula - it is totally unreal and he is an evil person that is against Christianity. So in this movie I really can't root for the bad guy. I never really liked Dracula. There are also a lot of false things in this from a historical perspective. Vlad the Impaler was real and those scenes were very good. But the part where he renounces God changes every thing. A lot of this was not real, which is another reason why I didn't like it."
"chvylvr80","10","2","3","15 October 2003"," the most faithful adaptation of the novel
","Bram Stoker's Dracula is most faithful to the original story and the only Dracula movie I'm aware of that takes notice of both the sexual tension of the Victorian era and the love story that Dracula presents. Dracula is a fine film that shows off the talents of all it's actors save one and the talent of Francis Ford Coppola.<br/><br/>The one actor to screw up his character is Keanu Reeves. They made him look like he was from 1898 all right but he has trouble bringing his character to life. That comes as no surprise to me because I've always known that he is a marginal talent that has his looks to thank for his fame. He is really Ted in every movie. In The Matrix he was Hacker Ted, in Speed he was Cop Ted, in Point Break he was FBI Ted, and in Dracula he is Victorian Ted. The fact that Keanu sucks shouldn't distract you from the great performances of his fellow actors though. Gary Oldman is probably the most underrated actor ever. He is a master at accents and is a completely different character in every movie he's in. Oldman plays Dracula without a hint of camp and with all the emotion that the character demands. Anthony Hopkins is another talent that fills the screen with his good but a little over the top portrayal of Dr. Van Helsing. Winona Ryder, Sadie Frost, Richard E. Grant, Bruce Campbell, Cary Elwes, and even Tom Waits all turn in masterful acting jobs.<br/><br/>The visual aspect of Dracula is it's greatest strength in my opinion. The spectacular sets really bring you into the story. The elaborate and beautiful costumes by Oscar winner Eiko Ishioka are incredible. The original score is quite moving and fits the scenes that it is in perfectly.<br/><br/>Basically what I am trying to say here is that Dracula is the most well made vampire movie and the best told Dracula story ever. It is told lovingly by a director who is a master of his craft and a cast that relishes their roles. Except for Ted, er Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: It really sucks that this film has not received the Special Edition DVD treatment yet, as the current DVD has no extras at all and not even a trailer. If you haven't seen it then rent it, see it, fall in love with it, and then wait for the Special Edition to come out. It will eventually. Look how long we had to wait for Indiana Jones."

","There are those who find this film flawed. I must admit that there are times when the story lags. And yes, Keanu Reeves' performance does provide for some unintentional comic relief. But this is not a movie where you should scrutinize too closely. It's a big epic, a sweeping spectacle full of gushing blood and heated eroticism. It has somptuous costumes and sets. The score is absolutely fantastic. The make-up effects are quite chilling and effective, especially when Dracula is transformed into a beast. As for the cast, like I said, Keanu will give you a good laugh. Gary Oldman may have seemed an unusual choice for the lead at the time, but I can't think of anyone else in the part. Winona Ryder is good, too. Her proper girl is a nice contrast to the adventurous, sensual character played by Sadie Frost. Although this $40 million production was expected to be a big turkey after negative test screenings and tracking, it turned into a $200+ worldwide million box office smash in 1992. A bloody good show, indeed. And winner of 3 Oscars. Grade: A-"

","To anyone who has ever read Bram Stoker's Dracula, I have to ask why? Because, although I am an avid reader I found the book to be exceedingly dull. If this movie had followed the book nobody would have went to see it. I love this movie for it's feel of darkness and the great ambiance it sets. And although people harp about this and that, the movie is not really about horror, gore and Bram Stoker's book so much, as it is about love. To me, the human condition (or vampire in this case) is what supremely interesting movies are about."

","Well I must say that when I first viewed this movie I (for the most part) enjoyed it.  The cast was pretty good (I won't name names on who was bad because anyone who sees this movie can easily figure it out), the direction was gorgeous, and the story seemed pretty solid.  Then I began to question things about the storyline such as: why did Mina fall in love with Vlad? Why does he appear old to some and young to others?  why does he need Jonathan?  So to answer these questions i went to the book.  What a surprise that was.  I must say that the movie doesn't really come that close to the book at all.  You would expect for a movie called BRAM STOKER'S Dracula they would've tried to come closer to the intended storyline.  Granted they did perfectly re-create some scenes but for the most part it could've been better.  I can't stress to you the fact that this could've been a much better movie (especially the ending).  Well I won't harp on that any longer but instead return to the movie itself.  If you have no real knowledge of Dracula and have an interest in the subject of vampires than this is the best place to start.  The movie did keep all the rules of the vampires from the book.  This pretty much has something for anyone: dark humor, gore, romance, suspense, gore (I say it twice because it is that bloody), and of course Keanu Reeves who is like dude the best actor on the planet yeah radical (note the sarcasm it is intended).  I would definitely rent this movie before reading the book (you will respect it more).  So give it a look and i hope your first viewing was as enjoyable as mine."

","Having just read the book and viewed the cast list, I was excited about renting the DVD and watching it.  My excitement was quickly extinguished. I realize that adaptations need to change elements of the storyline in order to make the movie flow or more easily accessible, but this adaptation took too many liberties in my view.  The acting was deplorable; I even had trouble with the great Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Van Helsing!  And I revere Hopkins.  Keanu's high school level performance was hard to watch. I can't believe Coppola directed this, nor can I understand how it won three oscars.  Lastly, is it not possible to portray ""sensual"" without getting naked?  Just my view."

"backstr","4","2","3","5 February 2002"," Not so great, really
","Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula"" is the most filmed book in the world. There are a few quite decent movies based on it, a pair of real masterpieces (like ""Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens"" from 1922), and a whole bunch of really, really bad ones. Coppola's interpretation of the story is not one of the masterpieces. By far. The creepy, mystical terror that drives the novel and the classical Dracula movies was, unfortunately, drowned in gushing blood and sexuality. Moreover, a few ""explanations"" of the background of the undead count and his acting was added to this filming of the novel, which in my opinion reduced the mystics and terror further. Coppola's film is skillfully made, contains some really good acting, and has a romantic touch to it, which is what is saving it from being grouped with the really bad vampire movies from the seventies. I rate this Dracula movie as ""decent"", not more - not less."

","As far as chain of events go, it's the closest adaptation I've seen of the book. But, while playing that true to the book, each character is quite different. There was only one seen in the movie where I saw the books Dracula come forward. When the brides are attacking Harker, Dracula frightens them away, gives them a poor baby to feed on, but then turns to Harker and laughs evilly. THAT is the Dracula I Bram
Stoked created. But once he arrived in London (in the movie) he suddenly becomes a lover that only wants to have his wife. Van helsing is also a puzzle. He is a sacred minded person but then he is laughing and excited that Lucy became a vampire and that Dracula is in his midst.<br/><br/>So, as a vampire movie it's one of the better ones I've seen and flows well. But, character wise it is extremely unfaithful to the book."
"mgd_m","7","1","1","18 January 2020"," Some flaws and some outstanding aspects
","Must-see overall. The flaws: the first part is quite clunky, the script makes no effort in trying to make things believable or coherent. Reeves is awful (he is nominated for the worst miscasting ever). Van Helsing is quite annoying, dull character and over-the-top at the same time. Some outdoor scenographies and lighting are absymal (Coppola choose to shoot everything on stage to avoid production delays). Some dialogues are silly, the XIX century language sounds weird at times. Some visual effects in the first act look quite dated and ridiculous.<br/><br/>But once the story gets going, most of these shortcomings disappear. Seems like Coppola spent all of his effort on the second and third act. The pace becomes faster. There are several jumps forward in time that help build a tragic/romantic/oniric atmosphere. The show is stealed by Ryder (perfect in acting her possession and dilemma) and Oldman. Oldman is a force of Nature: dramatic, empathic, pompous. Their love story is outstanding, spanning four centuries on the notes of a dedicated musical theme. Dracula's character becomes deep and human. The ending is well conceived. Meanwhile, Coppola starts showing his best visual effects one by one - both camera effects and prosthetics. Dracula is a powerful, mesmerizing presence, in each of his many shapes: impeccably elegant englishman, creepy old man, haunting beast. Visually the movie reaches its height during the final scene outside of the castle, that is a thing of beauty. Overall, the movie is a powerful, baroque and truly romantic narration of a XIX century tale."

","For some reason, very good movies do not catch my eye until much later. That may be because I have been in engrossed in so many movies made before the 1990's.<br/><br/>I have seen Gary Oldman play Dracula several times and will see this horror flick again. The movie deserved the awards it received and I think one reason is the special effects. Not that it had many special effects, it did. Most people think of special effects as the visual eye candy, the behind-the-scenes manipulation and tricks that horror and sci-fi are noted for. Yet in Bram Stoker's Dracula, the camera itself must take credit for the chilling atmosphere and occult crafting found in the film's visual mastery. Screenplay is what I am actually referring to, and the screenplay is what makes the movie so strong in its intent to transfer a ghost story into reality.<br/><br/>My prejudices in actors being what they always are, Anthony Hopkins is my candidate for the most credible supernatural expert on Nosferatu. It's interesting and possibly very unique that the actor plays the somewhat eccentric but intelligent physician but also a priest as well as a narrator. Van Helsing gives the movie what all dramatic movies what I call a wealth of humorous injection. Whether you or I give any credence to the occult or the supernatural, the circumstances surrounding the profound interplay between the living and undead, it is lighthearted to hear a doctor say ""I just want to cut off her head and put a stake through her heart""."

The adaptation of Francis Ford Coppola is, in spite of an almost big down in a moment in its plot, one of the best that i have ever seen (I apologize that i have not read complete the book, thing that i going to do soon). Closer of be the perfect Dracula (The best that i have ever seen is, without a doubt: Max Scherck of ""Nosferatu""), Gary Oldman embodies the ghostly and seductive essence of his character. The part in the cast is great too: Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, Anthony Hopkins, Bill Campbell and Edie Frost shines too. But maybe the most exciting and most characteristic that achieve the excellence is the image, the scenario, the colors and its music. The unforgettable -as a i say bellow- soundtrack is a real wonder. ""Bram Stocker's Dracula"" achieves in that point, something that movies like ""Meet in St. Louis"", ""Le faboleux destin de AmÃ©lie Poulain"" and ""Big Fish"" do in color and texture -althoug don't in the creepy meaning- .

","Every person that has read the original novel by Bram Stoker must have felt totally let down by all the previous movie adaptations . For the very first time , the count has not been portrayed being just a blood thirsty monster with a funny accent . Gary Oldman , perfectly cast as the count , takes the character to the next level . He manages to portray the count as a fallen angel , out of grace from God and all human beings . He adds emotion and melancholy and keeps the constant thrill of danger without becoming an overacting spoof as so many of his predecessors . This film gets his strength from the fact that storyline and character development are for more important and focused on than the horror aspect of it all . Strong casting continues with Winona Ryder as Mina Murray , who portrays the character as a beautiful and innocent Snowwhite seduced by the big bad wolf . She even surprises towards the end when Mina gets under the influence of the brides and attacks Van Helsing .It's rare to see Winona as the seductive vixen ... Anthony Hopkins has the authority to be Van Helsing , the sworn enemy of Dracula and the only human the count fears . Also Hopkins brings the so needed humor when it comes to these kind of overly serious stories . Big surprise is Sadie Frost as aristocratic heiress Lucy Westenra , her performance varies from lighthearted to sultry and adds a lot of eroticism to the movie . Especially the sequence where she , once a vampire and returning to her tomb , bumps into Van Helsing and her former beaus . The best version of this scene so far . Credits go also to Tom Waits as deranged Renfield and the casting of the brides , who where chosen from thousands of models across the world . Amongst them Italian model Monica Bellucci who made her Hollywood debut with this film . The only casting disappointment is Keanu Reeves , who's acting is without soul and his American accent is out of place , a pity . There were enough good actors available who could have given a much more pleasing performance . Eiko Ishioka , responsible for the opulent costumes , had long conversations with director Francis Ford Coppola in order to create the exact look for the movie . The costumes are full of symbolism and relate to the artists from that period ( many of Dracula's robes are inspired by paintings of Gustav Klimt ). As well do the costumes expand the personalities of the characters who wear them . Initially , Coppola had the idea to put the actors in costume and let them perform on complete black sets . The film studio believed this not being commercial and were rather aspiring box office success than the creation of an art movie . Although this movie is more than 15 years old , it remains the best Dracula adaption ever . A classic in his genre and a must see for all fans of Gothic and romantic cinema ."
"regertz","9","1","1","20 February 2005"," Best of the Dracule but...
","This is a marvelous film and Gary Oldman's is the outstanding Dracula performance, though he is ably abetted by tremendous special effects. The rest of the cast is likewise first-rate, and I would include Keenu Reeves' Harker, despite some problems, which some are too quick I feel to put on Mr. Reeves' acting abilities. In fact, he's handicapped by the script which creates a rather strange situation in which his wife, Mina, the reincarnation of the noble Princess of the Dracule, Elisabeta, is willing to betray the memory of her murdered friend Lucy, the valiant men trying to save her, and her own long-suffering husband in order to embrace eternal death with the fiend Dracula. Who, we are given to understand is not as hampered in his tormented existence as in the Stoker novel. He has retained the ability to understand right and wrong and made his choice after his wife's untimely suicide.<br/><br/>In a final confrontation after Dracula receives his death wound, having pulled a gun on poor Harker, she, having chosen Dracula and an Unlife of murder and blood lust, demands he tell her if he will kill her as he has Dracula and Lucy's vampire. Harker is forced by the script to say that he would not...Though of course it would be an act of love to save her soul, one her so-called 'loving' Dracula is apparently not capable of. Had Reeves been allowed to give Harker some bite, call Mina on her actions, and set his love for her soul against Dracula's lust to make her his undead consort, I think the role would have been far more impressive."

Unlike the book, they actually show Dracula's motivation behind his actions. Otherwise, it's fairly accurate to the book (for a 2-hour movie), thought it's much better than the book--more understandable, more exciting, less long, better dialog. The costumes are beautiful, and they also fit the time period. The music is good, and also fits with the movie since it sounds dark, and some parts sound Transylvanian. Keanu Reeves is the only one that doesn't quite fit in--his British accent needs some work. But overall, a great movie."
"dirtychild","Null","1","1","2 July 2004"," Colorful, stylish adaptation
","Bram Stoker's Dracula was a return to the original Stoker's text (a move away from those cheesy Hammer Drac films).  It tells the story of Count Dracula and Mina (a incarnate of Dracula's former lover) and their undying love for each other. This is a visually striking and arresting film - the design, costume and makeup is unforgettable (who could forget Dracula's queer hairdo...?). My only problem with the film - is the casting of both Mina and Jonathon Harker with both Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves respectively - I thought they were cast because they were the ""then"" hot young actors - but they both can't act their way out of a shoe box....  But Gary Oldman tries to ""somewhat break the typecast"" by being the subject of desire (even though he is the bad guy...)."
"Manthorpe","9","1","1","16 June 2004"," Blood.
","Francis Ford Coppola is an amazing director worthy of the status he's been given by making some of the best movies of all time. Dracula is a very decent movie but not a classic, even though I simply adore Gary Oldman and love his simply amazing portrayal of Dracula in this film. A true joy to watch and never one to disappoint. His evil laugh during ""the baby scene"" is one for the history books....too evil for words. Chilling. It also has Keanu Reeves in it, my least favorite actor. Keanu can't act to save his life, and the only rational reason for his movie appearances (notice I didn't say performances) is the fact that he's a panty waist pushover that will never object to anything any director asks him to do which makes him more palatable as a casting choice, I suppose. I can't imagine anyone who would actually think he's a good or great actor. I respect Coppola but I have no idea what in the hell he was thinking when he cast this joke and at the same time displayed impeccable taste by casting Oldman. Without Keananu, I might like it a little better. At least his role is fairly minimal.<br/><br/>I do enjoy watching this film very much and I even own it, but when I view it I'm simply waiting for Oldman to appear and display his talent. The guy is a chameleon with all of the different accents he has successfully portrayed over his years of playing villains and never falls below my high expectations, even in films that are mediocre. His Transylvanian accent is so thick that it's difficult to believe that he doesn't actually speak that way. Winona Ryder is satisfactory as Dracula's lover but she always reminds me of an upset little sister with her pouty expressions and melodrama. I will admit that there is quite an unusual amount of chemistry between her and Oldman here. Anthony Hopkins plays Van Helsing, the vampire hunter, and is amusing to watch and also does a fine job with his accent.<br/><br/>
I think the reason the film wasn't perfect other than the questionable casting choices is that it seems to take the road of style over substance. I feel it could have been perfect. The sets, costumes, and musical score are all great and the story progresses quite nicely but it seems absurd at times. Also, Coppola must've had a massive unrelenting erection while filming. The unneeded nudity and sexual provocative-ness of the female vampires seems a little silly sometimes. This very well could have been in Bram Stoker's book, which I have not read, and I could be entirely wrong but it seems to be a little much even though I truly love breasts. Some of the special effects are poor which is most likely a result of Coppolla's studio approaching bankruptcy during filming. Other than that the film has a great story and is filmed beautifully and is very enjoyable to watch. Overall, above average. I would love to see Gary get more starring roles. I'll get off his lap now, my dance is over."
"malkane316","8","1","1","23 May 2004"," quick reviews!
","The second of the literal horror movies from the nineties on my top 150 list, Dracula is a success because of the chemistry between Oldman and Ryder, two of the most versatile actors around. Of the billions of stories told about Dracula, this one looks the most authentic, although, like most others, it strays from the text to suit its own desires. Reeves is not the greatest choice for Jonathan, but the rest of the cast are perfect, including Hopkins as the enthusiastic Van Helsing, and Tom Waits as Renfield. Gory in parts, with sublime dialogue, the only let down may be that the whole romantic angle is taken too far, that we may feel too much sympathy towards Dracula. The final few scenes are stand outs."
"mdefranc","Null","1","1","3 November 2003"," Immortal
","Of the many versions to date, I have found Coppola's to be the one that finally offers the dramatic aspect no other Dracula director's camera has been able to give us. I must say that I am flabbergasted by the main co-stars' choice, being that I deem both Keanu Reaves and Winona Ryder B-class actors in ever aspect of their so-called performances. Nevertheless, Coppola's direction, the score and Hopkins' presence in the movie, with a diabolic Sadie Frost have acted as a painter's ability to make use of unwanted blemishes on a canvas, at times hiding them with passionate and vibrant strokes.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about Gary Oldman performance, which has literally disabled my ability to even flinch during the movie for how incredible it was. Those who read the novel know that the very first part of the story is probably the crucial one from both a suspense and description standpoint: Jonathan Harker's diary of his journey to Transylvania, the caleche's conductor,his first encounter with Count Dracula and supper at the castle. Oldman's demeanor, pace in his talk, attire portrays the noble and valiant man Vlad The Impaler really was, making us also turn as pale as he was in the movie for how credible he seemed. The entire movie was rich of scenes and good performances by the entire supporting cast until the end.<br/><br/>In retrospective, after seeing the movie a few times, I feel as if the viewer enters a journey into a Klimt-like ensemble of colors and objects, from the Count's long cloak to the bed in which Harker gets devoured by the vampire's mistresses (The count himself is not the one who bites Harker as narrated in the book if you noticed). The costumes choice and creation have also made an instrumental contribution to the success of the movie and its ability to surpass all other Dracula's interpretations thus far. Coppola's knowledge of how to blend drama into an almost set-in-stone story like this one has been another lesson of how far his genius can reach."

Even the much maligned role of Keanu Reeves doesn't strike me as annoying.<br/><br/>The film definately isn't you're stereotypical horror flick. Instead it tells a very visual and hypnotic story filled with eroticism, romance and blood. It's not all that scary. It just tells a morbid and decadent story about a man who has basically lost all what he believed in and feels as if he gets a 2nd chance when he sees his lost love reincarnated in a simple woman.<br/><br/>What we have here is a film about Dracula the man. Not the monster. Yes we see aspects of that but mostly we see the man. The count who has lived with grief and madness for so long.. I think this is an interesting view on the legend. We saw this side of vampires in Interview With The Vampire which is in my humble oppinion better and more epic but still as vampire films go this comes close.<br/><br/>All in all I reccommend this highly.

","The incomparable direction of Francis Ford Coppola combines well with Bram Stoker's vampire potboiler in this millionth retelling of the Dracula story. Featuring a mostly outstanding and delightfully surprising cast (note Tom Waits' role as Renfield), it serves up a touching story of a love condemned to live past death in a swirl of ornate costumes and a shower of blood. Yet it is more than a basic sex-and-blood vampire romp; Coppola's script, which is fairly closely based on Stoker's 1898 book, subtly explores Victorian ideas about class, religion, and sexuality while still presenting enough of a symbolic spectacle to keep intelligent viewers interested.  After all, Stoker's ""Dracula"" was a popular novel that only recently gained academic respect, and its leap from book to stage, and then stage to screen, was an entirely popular and natural one.  How refreshing to see amidst the puerile carnage of vampire flicks one that reflects and enhances the respect ""Dracula"" richly deserves."

"morpheus825","Null","1","1","17 December 1999"," The Pros and Cons of a modern Masterpiece
","First let me begin by saying this is one of my favorite films.  With that in mind, I will begin with the pros.  The Music:  The sound score is so overwhelmingly brilliant it adds just the right air of classical Victorian mixed with a tenor of dominating intrigue.  It is not as well mixed as the sound-score for Interview w/t Vampire but is definately one of my favorites. Gary Oldman's acting is the best rendition of Dracula to date.  His accent is flawless and he is politely charming and menacing all at once.  In all...his finest performance.  He can only be upstaged by Anthony Hopkins who is the first actor to ADEQUATELY portray the role of Van Helsing.  If you are familiar with the novel than you know that Hopkins' version stands truer to form than any other.  The cinematagraphy is the most amazing I have ever seen.  The camera angles, the lighting, the zoom-effects and the movement tricks are handled with such chaotic harmony that they are almost poetic.  Truly original and creative filming.  Renfield is truly the pitiable maniac that he is meant to be.  A sane man fighting for his soul. I can not offer this movie enough praise.  Every time I watch it, it scares the Hell out of me.  But...its not perfect. Alas...the cons. Keanu Reeves????????????  What were they thinking?  Why don't they get Boris Karloff?  I think Karloff could do a better acting job from the grave than Reeves did.  Reeves' performance did all but massacre the integrity of the story.  His British accent is so forced and inconsistent that it is pathetically laughable. Another bad element of the story:  We seem to have gone a little overboard with the costume concepts.  Yes...I know Dracula is supposed to be a blonde. And yes I know that he should be expected to wear the cultural garb of a Wallachian Boyar.  But he was just a little too frilly and ridiculous looking.  I mean...how damn long does your cape have to be?  It's a wonder he wasn't tripping and stumbling all over the place. Lastly....a little bit of clarification.  Many people believe that Dracula is supposed to be some kind of Romantic tale set within a Gothic atmosphere. It's not.  Read Stoker's novel.  His seduction of Mina is not about Romance.  It's about power.  Pure and Simple.  One human being exerting his power over another.  It is rape. Except in this instance it is not the raping of something relatively unimportant such as a person's body.  It is a rape of the soul and that is far worse and certainly not romantic.  Mina acts in ways that are completely uncharacteristic.  She is showed as being way to prim and proper to ever cheat on her husband to be with some stranger.  Dracula dominates her entirely.  She is not seduced or corrupted but completely overpowered.  Be careful not to confuse that dominative aspect of his villainy with passion or seduction.  It's not about that at all. The film...the novel...the lore...the history...the franchise.  All excellent.  Watch the film."

Gary Oldman is simply awesome, as dracula, the mannerisms, voice and emotions  perfect beyond compare.Anthony Hoppkins as Van Helsing , Dracula`s life long nemisis delivers a brilliant performance as a man obsessed to rid the world of the devil. other performances by sadie frost as lucy were also inspiring.<br/><br/>the visuals and most of all the score were simply breath taking.<br/><br/>even the scenes of blood pools were tastefully done , unlike other movies where you feel sick.<br/><br/>the most brilliant of all scenes is the seduction of Jonathan Harker by the 3 wives of Dracula... it was the most erotic horror sequence i have ever seen.<br/><br/>on the whole a brilliant film that should become a cult classic."

","This film is the most true to the novel, though it does take liberties with romance.  It is a gorgeous masterpiece.  The film's one detraction is Keanu Reeves, whose accent and acting are (always) wanting.  Several of his lines are laughable and have become trademark joke expressions between my friends and me.  The rest of the cast is however, is fabulous.  Sadie Frost, Tom Waits, and Gary Oldman are incredible. The score is brilliant and the visual effects are amazing.  The film doesn't revert to the CGI tricks that most modern movies poorly utilize and it excells for that. I highly recommend this film to any fan of Bram Stoker's novel.  If you enjoy Tod Browning's 1931 borefest, however, stay away.  You'll get confused."

In this movie, Vlad is not the evil villain as in so many other adaptions, but a victim. A victim of love and passion. Coppola created a sad but sublime Vlad Tepes in a way never shown. The emphasis lies on the love-theme, which was originally intended by Bram Stoker. If you haven't seen this one, watch it and you will be drowned in a world of love, passion and sublime romance."

"RadiationHeadpiece","Null","1","1","3 June 2001"," beautifully crafted piece of horrific love
","Of course, all dracula fans know the story and have heard it few too many times.  But, it seems as if coppola's version is somewhat different than it predecessor's.  What you must realize when watching this movie is that it is not about terror of vampires or the wrath of nosferatu, but simply about love, the universal subject of the world.   Though this seems clearly shown throughout the movie, it has come to my attention that most people have not recognized the tragedy for what it really is. Though it is violent and gory, it is also entrancing.  With the strange visuals throughout the movie including the weird blue and green lights that were almost groundbreaking in 1992, it seems that it enhanced the viewing of the movie and also knowing that they spent time on the horror element of the film rather than always focusing on romance.  <br/><br/>The part of the film I didn't like was the first-person view of the beast running through the woods.  Now, I will admit in 1992, this was probably scary, but I think that Evil Dead 2 just totally ruined that scene.  Evil Dead 2 being a very funny movie, did not mean in any way to harm the viewing of this masterpiece I am sure, but the fact of the matter is, it almost seems like it was copied.  After seeing ED2, this part made the movie cheesy in a way, and I did not like that feeling.<br/><br/>What made up for the ED2 cheesiness though, was the very solid cast and their very solid acting.  Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder, and Keanu Reeves! What a cast!  Probably the best cast in a ""horror"" film ever. Anthony Hopkins ranking way up there on my favorite actors list of all time, sord of stole the show at times, but I was glad to see not all the time, leaving more room for the other actors to show their great talent.  The cast made some of the shallow gore into a dramatic showing of epic proportions. It was like the cast felt the script when they were acting it.  The acting will remain in memory along with some of the best acting ever (Titus, Magnolia, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Silence of the Lambs, Nsferatu, American History X etc.) <br/><br/>Overall this movie towers over other dracula films (except for nosferatu of course) and is a must-see for any film lover of any kind, but remember to be awake and to clench your teeth.<br/><br/>*********/********** 9/10"
"Thornfield2","Null","1","1","24 May 2001"," A visionary masterpiece
","I was a little leary on watching this film because so many people said it strayed from the book. The book is one of the best works ever written and I wanted to watch a version that was true to what Bram Stoker had visioned. This movie did stray, however, it wondered in the best direction. I really like how the love story was developed between the Count and Mena and how the scenery, costumes and dialogue made the story like a gothic fairy tale. Of course Wynona Ryder shines as Mena Murray and she embodies the role of the compassionate, nieve, and child-like character perfectly. Gary Oldman is the greatest Dracula to ever grace the screen and his scenes with Ryder were some of the most magical scenes in a movie I have ever seen. I cannot begin to find the words that describe Gary Oldman's talent. He's truly one of the greatest actors of his generation. This is not the first film that I have seen him in. He brilliantly captures every aspect of his role as the count, from the way he quietly, but passionately gazes at Mena, to his refined, yet brooding and seductive stature and graceful movements of an ancient European aristocrat to even mastering a Transylvanian accent. The lush and colorful costumes and scenery are just a pleasure to behold and the side characters, especially Sadie Frost's Lucy were exceptional. This haunting story and forbidden love may not be true to the book, but it is a splendid marvel to behold."

I haven't been able to figure out what is up and what is down in his castle.<br/><br/>The movie has a great cast, Gary Oldman (Dracula), Winona Ryder (Mina), Anthony Hopkins (Dr. Van Helsing) and Keanu Reeves (Jonathan). They all do a great job, especially Oldman and Hopkins. Goldman has a lot of make-up as the older Dracula and a pretty heavy costume. Hopkins plays a weird character, who acts.well..weird. Also pay attention to Jonathans hair and Mina's character. They both change in a strange way. Lucy is the humor source in this movie, she does a couple of funny things. Also the men who wish to marry her, act pretty funny when they compete each other.<br/><br/>There's of course some romance in it, because Dracula thinks Mina is the reincarnation of his lost love Elisabeta. I only didn't like it that Dracula was able to walk in the sunlight. In the book he couldn't and vampires just shouldn't be able to do that.<br/><br/>But besides that it's definitely worth watching."

The only thing I didn't like was the lack of how Dracula got to be a vampire; because he wished it ? Winona Ryder and Sadie Frost are sexy, and Keanu Reeves pulls off a fair if not befuddled performance as if he's still rather distracted by his scene with the female vampires. ""Were two of them glued together at the crotch ?"" Cary Elwes is one of the heroes, but at times Anthony Hopkins' Van Helsing looks like Hannibal Lecter ! The score in the theater,though, was deafening, but is appreciated much more on video. Gary Oldham makes me forget he once played Lee Harvey Oswald, but then he is almost indistinguishable as the young or old Dracula. His wig was lampooned hysterically by Leslie Nielsen in ""Dracula:Dead and Loving It."" This movie goes to the top of my favorite vampire movies list near ""Lemora"" and ""Interview of the Vampire,"" but I just have to ask: would it have hurt to leave Winona or Sadie as a vampire ?"

","A film like this is better for its cinematic ideals rather than neccesarily the plot. The use of Keanu Reeves' very wooden english accent may seem rather tedious but as the book is based around the prudeness of victorian society I think it is very apt. There are some great camera shots in this film, a jerky style of camera is used to portray madness. Which I felt worked very well. Just because a film doesn't follw the book it was based on exactly doesn't make it a bad film, It protrays the ideas and themes that Bram Stoker meant when writing his play. All of these together make - for me - a very entertaining film that thrilled me cinematically as well as having a followable plot, something that quite often can be lost when making a version of Dracula."

","Francis Ford Coppola is a genius with everything is this film. Some critics may find the film contains excessive amounts of blood, but has anyone stopped to think, that Coppola is providing metaphors for the audience if only they would stop to figure it out. The 80's and early 90's were highlighted as the years aids did it's worst to people living in the UK, Coppola highlights this by showing excessive amounts of blood on-screen, which is needed for the transfer of HIV, and the sharing of blood between Lucy and her suitor, when he gives a blood donation as she lies in a coma. The film is excellent, and who really cares if it doesn't mirror the book's text? It's the definitive Dracula film and cinema and text are supposed to be two totally different mediums anyway. Gary Oldman gives an impeccable performance etc.. I wont go on as you've already read this. Keanu Reeves although not as polished as the other cast members, does actually try to be English, so credit is given where it's due in my opinion. Mise-en-scene (everything in the picture) and sound work flawlessly together, and the film is capable of touching the audience, because of it's heart-wrenching narrative. Gary Oldman the ultimate Vampire gets my vote, because for the first time ever in the history of vampire films, you are shown that he has human feelings too and is capable of loving another, and feeling emotions. Wonderful, fantastic, not to be knocked. A must for your video collection!"

","I first saw this movie on video because I was still too young to watch in in the theater when it came out. But the older I get the more I appreciate it.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola was able to make a respectful movie adaptation of the mythology of Dracula/Vlad the Impaler. I can tell he was influenced by Murnau in this movie but he still succeeded in making it very original.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder is so beautiful in this movie and she plays Mina with the delicacy and vulnerability that was required by her character. Keanu Reeves played Jonathan Harker with the innocence that was necessary even though many people ridiculed him. And the great Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins were very good and convincing all throughout. Like Count Dracul himself, this is a movie that gets better with time and age. I give this movie 9 stars out of 10."
"jackc232","6","3","6","9 April 2010"," A little flawed
","Everybody knows the tale of Dracula, or at least, have a vague understanding of the mythos. For those that need a little reminder the story is rather simple. Jonathan Harker travels from London to the Carpathian Mountains, on the border to Transylvania. There he meets Count Dracula and acts as his solicitor. Dracula then moves to London and all manner of strange things occur.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's version strays little from this vague introduction that I have afforded, but that, I am afraid, is where the similarity ends. The characters names remain the same but the actions they carry out are completely alien to the source material. For example the love story between Mina Harker and Dracula is a completely new angle on the tale. Throughout the movie many of these changes occur. It is so far removed from the original that you may even question if the writers ever read it! If you have read the book then you may take offense to Coppola's interpretation. The only way I managed to enjoy it, having read the book, is forcing myself to believe it is not part of the same story ark.<br/><br/>The saving grace of this film is undoubtedly Gary Oldman. It takes an acting pro to hold a film on his own, thankfully Oldman is just that. Upon watching his performance it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role. It is unequivocally the role he was born to play! It is unfortunate that an actor is the saving grace of a film but that is often the way. I will not even begin to discuss Keanu Reeves' acting in this, let's just say it wasn't that good, (little surprise there then).<br/><br/>In all this film would be more aptly named ""Coppola's Dracula,"" at least the fans of the book would be appeased. There is something to be said for the special effects on the film, as they are quite groundbreaking. I would suggest checking out the special features to see how they were done as it is intriguing, to say the least. All I can say is watch the film, it is an excellent portrayal by Oldman I am sure you will agree, but the film is ""A little flawed."""
"feralgrinn","6","3","6","28 November 2009"," This film is far too melodramatic to be effective...
","This film is far too melodramatic to be effective, especially compared with its predecessors, ""Nosferatu"" and Bela Lugosi's version of the tale. The cut scenes jump rapidly, the camera work plays like an unfunny friend telling jokes and the acting, save for Dracula and Van Helsing, is horrible. Keanu Reeves is laughable in his role as Hutter, even given the need for an ""innocent"" and naive character, while the rest of the characters are lackluster and corny at best.<br/><br/>There are a few saving graces, to be sure. Gary Oldman is stellar as Dracula. Also, the love scene with Keanu and the 3 wives of Dracula is very erotic (especially if your preference is women... or BDSM.) Lastly, Tom Waits makes a pretty good Renfield - even if he, too, is a bit melodramatic in the role. How 90's.<br/><br/>Enjoy, it is a respectable addition to the vampire canon, if not its best example."
"dusty-bottoms","5","3","6","29 December 2006"," Over-theatrical nonsense
","First of all, let me say Gary Oldman would have made a superb Dracula. I say 'would have' because what he plays here is some frenetic Hollywood-esquire demon more suited to comic books than a Gothic romance. This OTT-ness is symptomatic of our over-indulgence in SFX-laden blockbusters, where each film must be noisier, faster, more intense/expensive/silly than the last. This is like a Victorian Matrix Reloaded, a Spiderman 2 for the brain-dead (indistinguishable from the real Spiderman 2), a Batman & Robin for those with a passing interest in the classics. 'Van Helsing' is unwatchable because of this, despite the luminous Kate Beckinsale. (I LOVE Underworld)<br/><br/>Back to Gaz. He is without doubt a fine actor. A fine English actor. Such a fine English actor that I suspect most Americans (and Brits for that matter, including my wife) have no idea of his origin. His ability to BECOME the character he portrays (Leon, Fifth Element, Sid & Nancy etc) would indeed have made him the perfect choice for this role. 'The finest actor of his generation' I would venture, Tim Roth & Johnny Depp notwithstanding. Keanu Reeves most definitely is NOT. Neither is the Welsh/American Anthony Hopkins who, along with the Sean Connerys and Michael Caines of this world gets by with various versions of himself. Not a damning indictment per se (Hopkins' Titus Andronicus was stupendous, Connery & Caine unsurpassed in 'The Man Who Would Be King'). Oldman and Reeves however occupy opposing ends of the acting spectrum. Oldman is great, Reeves isn't (although I LOVED Bill & Ted).<br/><br/>Back to Dracula. A faithful adaptation of the book it isn't. The names are the same, the events have been changed to produce some sort of shouty melodrama. Gary Oldman WOULD have made a superb Dracula, it is a shame he chose to try it in this abysmal pile of dog-poo. 'Interview With a Vampire' suffered terrible mis-casting but (almost) worked. This didn't even re-create the menacing atmosphere it required (see 'Dance of the Vampires'). Five stars to Oldman for being game for a laugh, and otherwise a genuine superstar."

","OK, to be fair, I have not seen the whole movie. That's because I had to turn it off because it was so bad. Having just finished the novel days earlier, I was excited to see this movie. But I was horrified at how campy it was. How many times do we have to see creepy Dracula shadows everywhere? (note: in the book he HAS no shadow) The story is scary enough, you don't have to add all that crap. Keanu Reeves was, predictably, horrible. And, true to Francis Ford Coppola, the movie was WAY more sexual than the book ever considered being. Lucy was portrayed as a flirtatious tart, when really she is innocent and sweet, which is what makes her turning into a vampire so shocking and heart-rending. Maybe I sound like a prude, but holy nudity! Totally unnecessary. I think it an absolute tragedy that Copola would have the NERVE to title this ""Bram Stoker's"" Dracula, when I was so inaccurate and sexual. The sexuality of vampires is always subtle, not in your face ""check out my boobs."" The cinematography was awful and cheesy. You know, eyes checking you out from the sky and weird shadows, and what was WITH the hair on Dracula?? I felt this was an awful movie and I'm SO glad I didn't finish it! If you are not a literary person and never read the book, and happen to like dirty pornography scenes, have at it. But please. Bad acting, bad script, bad adaptation from the book, YUCK."

The dialog is ridiculous, Gary Oldman camps it up and plays it for what it is, but again, even his talents only turn this into a ridiculous farce at best.<br/><br/>Its just not believable on any level, and considering the talent Coppola gathered for this movie, in the end, its just a disappointing hammed up second rate Dracula movie (without any scary bits). 4/10."

","I was looking forward to this film when it was in production, but was very disappointed when I saw it. That feeling has deepened over time and multiple viewings. Not to say it isn't worth watching. This off-beat Dracula is artistically done and sometimes intriguing. That said, there's a LOT wrong with it. First off, and my pet peeve, is that it is NOT true to Bram Stoker's book by a wide margin. It should be retitled 'Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula' since he reinvented the whole thing and turned it into a sappy romance. Worse, the original story was scary as hell and this isn't at all. The original vampire was tall and menacing and Gary Oldman isn't close on either count(pun intended). And where did Coppola dream up that stupid hairdo in the castle? Geesh. Then, what was Coppola's problem with shooting everything indoors? This lends a certain stylization and staginess, but does nothing for effective sweep or breadth or realism in the scenes. Almost all of the outdoor shots, especially the travel ones are severely limited, the castle looks silly and fake -- it'a all done on such obvious SETS for Pete's sake! The acting is spotty, costuming overdone, Lucy's character is a total twit. Yada Yada Yada. If Coppola wants to reinvent Dracula, he has every right to go for it - everyone else has. But don't be deceptive and say it's Bram Stoker's story, cause it ain't. This is one strange trip. The definitive Dracula has yet to be made. This isn't even a near miss.

Much as I like her as an actress, Winona Ryder wasn't the right person for the job either.<br/><br/>As with all horror movies made in Hollywood, way too much use was made of special effects when the money could have been spent on a real actor to play Jonathan Harker. <br/><br/>Hopefully some day Hollywood would really learn how to make a horror movie instead of a splatterfest.

","Review:
'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is a gothic-horror film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is based on the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker.
I don't know if this movie just took me off guard or if it just isn't a movie for me, but I really didn't like this film. A lot of reviews say that the director stayed true to the love aspect of the novel and didn't take it down a horror route that the trailer teased that it would be.
The movie follows Dracula (Gary Oldman) as he leaves the captive Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) and Transylvania for London in search of Mina Harker (Winona Ryder), the reincarnation of Dracula's long-dead wife, Elisabeta. All the while obsessed vampire hunter Dr. Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) sets out to end the madness.
Gary Oldman is the best Dracula out there, hands down. He brought everything he had in this performance and he never held back. I can't say the say for Winona Ryder or Keanu Reeves as they seemed like they were sleeping through this movie. It was a shame because I didn't care about either of their characters at all. It was a weird role from Anthony Hopkins, I haven't seen him in such a abstract role as this, but he did a good job portraying Van Helsing.
There are some positives about this movie, such as the cinematography and the acting. The filmmaking is visually satisfying, and some of the special effects are downright amazing. Coppola's backlighting and use of shadows is creative and unique. I simply didn't like the story. This is a 2-hour movie and I was bored the whole way through. Also, while the acting was great, the actors were still portraying there characters as if they were on stage putting on a play instead of being in a movie.
Overall, this movie is so slow it's almost painful. The actors put on good performances, but it's nowhere what was needed for this movie to be a success.

"karmaswimswami","10","3","7","15 May 2014"," Exalted, sumptuous, sensuous trompe l'oeil Dracula
","Coppola's take on the Stoker idiom will compel you to watch again and again, as this film is so masterful and ingenious that even its flaws become attributes like the errors woven into fine Persian rugs. Oldman was born to play the ambivalent, eternal count, here sometimes depicted as a near-Eastern wise man. Coppola wryly uses the film as a quotation device for other fine tellings of Dracula, such as in the scenes in which Oldman as Dracula jack-in-the-boxes out of coffins (riffing on Max Schreck in ""Nosferatu""). The film's HIV metaphors work brilliantly, and Anthony Hopkins' occasionally off-kilter Van Helsing provides welcome comic relief. Keanu Reaves's performance as Jonathan Harker is dunderheaded enough to be oddly endearing. Michael Ballhaus's cinematography is an utter profusion of saturated colors with semiotic significance, and the old-style matte and optical special effects make CGI seem stagey, acerbic and bloodless by comparison. This may be the best art-directed film ever to come out of Hollywood, and Eiko Ishioka's costumes burn messages and motifs into the unconscious. Cary Elwes, Richard Grant, and Billy Campbell play an odd troika of unlike fellows who find thrilling common cause in fighting Dracula. Coppola features two fine debut turns from women whose performances seem larger than life: Sadie Frost as the vibrant but vulnerable Lucy, and Monica Bellucci as a lovely but fiendishly eroticized Dracula bride. Tom Waits stuns as Renfield. A resounding, enthusiastic and bombastic 10 stars."

Upon learning this-and feeling that God has betrayed him-the Romanian knight declares allegiance to the powers of darkness and is transformed into the vampire known as ""Dracula"" (Gary Oldman). From that point on he kills and feeds upon the blood of everyone within his reach until one day, 4 centuries later, he decides to relocate to London. And it's there that he sees an attractive woman named ""Mina Murray"" (Winona Ryder) who looks exactly like his long lost love which compels him he to reunite with her at all costs. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had some good points to it but, unfortunately, the further on it continued the more inconsistent and uneven it became. I also didn't quite like the appearance of Dracula who looked quite ridiculous at times. In any case, based on these criticisms I have to rate this film accordingly."

By far the worst, hammy and intensely irritating performance comes from Sadie Frost with a badly miscast Keanu Reeves coming in a very close second.

","Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula is a very good film. While the film is flawed in some ways with the casting of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, who were both bad choices for their roles. The film is otherwise excellent with state of the art visuals, exceptional,lush costumes, great set design, excellent f/x, great score and Gothic ambiance, fluid storytelling and powerhouse acting performances from the rest of the cast, especially Gary Oldman who shows exceptional range and depth as Dracula. Anthony Hopkins also is very good as Van Helsing and delivers a very good, eccentric performance. Keanu Reeves is horrible in this role and is very much more like Ted ""Theodore"" Logan than Jonathan Harker. His accent is laughably bad and performance was very wooden and unconvincing. Winona Ryder is less awkward in her role as Mina Harker, while a British actress would have been a better casting choice, she kind of makes it work. Plus the fact that Winona Ryder is stunning and absolutely gorgeous helps too. I always liked her and had a huge crush on her as well, and she is very beautiful in this film. However, I like her much better as the weird Goth girl in all those 80's movies, especially Heathers, where she really shines and is one of her best performances. But, the film is a real interesting and well made take on Bram Stoker's novel and is one that you don't need to be a fan of horror to appreciate. However, as a horror fan I love it and is a big budget epic that is a very classy and very entertaining Dracula adaptation."
"generationofswine","9","2","4","4 December 2016"," An Honest Review
","I like to read through everyone's reviews before I actually write my own. Get a feel for what they liked and didn't. Especially what they didn't like. It tells you a lot about the world.<br/><br/>With new movies, if a certain age group hates on how boring it is, that means there is an abundance of story and characterization. It usually means that it is a pretty good flick.<br/><br/>Dracula isn't one of those movies, the haters are coming from a totally opposite direction.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that the people hate because it wasn't exactly 100% like the books. To me that's boasting, it's saying ""Look I'm literate!"" It's a movie. It's the reason ""Catch-22"" fails when you turn it into a play, the formatting is too different, the time constraints too much and what works in books doesn't work in film.<br/><br/>I used to work in history and the same thing goes there, in fact a lot more in history. I don't understand those arguments at all.<br/><br/>Like the people that think they are being hip when they attack high school teachers for not teaching the REAL history. Teachers have 45 minutes a day for a few months to fit in 400 years in the US and 5,000 in world history.<br/><br/>It's not propaganda, it's not lies, it's abridgement based on time and format.<br/><br/>Who cares if it doesn't completely follow the book? You want the book, read the book.<br/><br/>Dracula was great.<br/><br/>For starters the soundtrack was moving. It was beautiful. It was sublime. It was brilliant. It was all the words for genius you can think of.<br/><br/>And for those of you that like special effects, Dracula was surreal and not CGI. I've always thought that movies that did as much as possible in camera looked better, more real and Dracula, well, it doesn't look necessarily more relativistic but more like nightmare dream. Again, beautiful.<br/><br/>And the cast. Legend has it that it was Ryder's dream cast. Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Richard E. Grant, Cary Elwes, Billy Campbell and Keanu Reeves is the only weak link in that chain...but that isn't really Keanu's fault.<br/><br/>The fact is Mr. Reeves was just too Gen-X to be in a period film. The man looks, talks, and acts like he's from my Generation and they through him in Victorian England? Really? It's not that he did a bad job, it's just that he looked out of place the entire time. Ryder is Gen-X too, but she has a look that can transcend that.<br/><br/>If they updated the film, made it in the 90s, and threw Harker in a flannel, some torn jeans and a pair of Doc Martins then people would be raving about how great of a job he did. How much he looked the part.<br/><br/>As it stands he was distracting. Not because he didn't do a good job but because it's just impossible for him to look Victorian and really pull it off.<br/><br/>And then back to the haters. ""Dracula"" was written in an epistolary format, can someone explain to me how a script is going to stay true to that? Yes, let's narrate ALL of the film? Let's sit people down in front of a camera and let them read news clippings and journals to the audience? Yeah, there is going to be some heave abridgement there. The script did a great job of making the story interesting for the silver screen.<br/><br/>Hollywood is way out over there and real life and source material are right here. If the two merge too much than Hollywood would cease to be entertaining."

","Not to fend off the evil one but to hold up to the screen to fend off this dreadfully ill-conceived movie Dracula.<br/><br/>The book had its moments - one I particularly remember was the description of Dracula climbing slowly head-first DOWN a wall. Why so chilling - because so unnatural for a human being or even almost any mammal - it is insect behaviour. More than 80 years on, the 1931 Bela Lugosi version has lost none of its power to chill and thrill. Lugosi had honed the role on stage, responding to nightly audience feedback - and the 1931 version had incorporated what Lugosi had learned. Part was very simple indeed - Dracula's super slow pace contrasted with frenetic Renfield. It marked Dracula as being in some way not human. Dracula appears on the surface to be courteous but as becomes clear, this is only to better trap his victims much as a meat eating plant emits a sweet smell to attract insects. Dracula's conversation is limited to serving his simple purposes - because that is all he has - a simple purpose.<br/><br/>Here, Dracula has become, apart from latex makeup, a bore, someone with a penchant for very extended discussion of his inner thoughts, the person who button-holes people and insists on telling them his life-story. <br/><br/>Looking at the 1931 version, one wonders if the subsequent 80+ years have been a time of adding to the the craft of film-making - or<br/><br/>subtracting from it."

The direction is outstanding. It has a very fine cast. Gary Oldman offers an excellent performance as Count Dracula, showing again his massive range as an actor. Winona Ryder bolsters the whimsical nature providing a sweet innocence with her talents, giving us a lens into the softer more heartfelt side of Dracula. Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing is terrific and creates a layer of appeal playing the quacked out, genius scientist hellbent on hunting Dracula.

I would give it a true '10'... and rank it as one of the most interesting movies ever made if they could somehow digitally replace Keanu Reaves. As he did in 'Much Ado About Nothing', his surfer dude persona sticks out like a sore thumb. It's such a huge mis-casting because the rest of the production is just so captivating.<br/><br/>Music, sets, costumes, old school effects (I mean seriously old school---like right out of the 20's and 30's). The acting is also fantastically over the top---again it's like watching something from the 30's or 40's. Some of the side parts are hammy, but frankly, that's kind of the idea.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the one exception to the over-acting is the lead: Oldman's Dracula is a tour de force. He plays The Count in 5-6 'versions' and in each guise he is a -presence-. (And BTW, his accent is amazing. His renderings only add to his gravitas... no Bela Lugosi jokes here.) <br/><br/>Can't recommend it enough if a) you can get in the spirit of English romances (I always think of Rebecca) and b) you can get past Keanu."

To be honest - I had a girlfriend when I was 16 that worshipped - falsely - the ground Francis Ford Coppola walked upon. Sure, he's made some good films, but Dracula is proof that he's as prone to error as any other mortal being.<br/><br/>There is far too much deviation from the excellent book. Keanu is in magnificently wooden form.

"drqshadow-reviews","4","2","4","13 February 2012"," A Beautiful Windbag, Coppola's Classical Horror is the Definition of Style Over Substance
","Francis Coppola's loyal translation of a classic piece of literature merely proves that many times some new wrinkles are necessary to interpret a printed property for the screen. Visually ambitious but thematically dreary, it often seems like a thin excuse to try out some of Hollywood's craziest ideas in wardrobe, set design, hairstyling and film editing. I'll tip my hat to Coppola's dedication to his craft; his demands that the entirety of the film's effects be produced in-camera have given the picture an eerie look entirely its own. When they're working, their influence makes the whole picture seem hazy, uncertain and ghostly, like a foggy, lucid dream. When it all goes wrong, though - and this happens fairly regularly - the illusion shatters and once deathly-serious scenes become downright hysterical. A super-heavyweight cast can do little, if anything, with a script so overcooked and while I'll always welcome a healthy dose of indulgent sex scenes, they really don't seem to have a point here."

","Fans of the book be warned, you may find something much different than you found in the book. In the movie adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula - we are shown the story of a man who - in the 15th century - lost everything he held dear and so turned his back on God who in turn, punished him with being undead and forced to walk the shadows of the earth for all eternity.<br/><br/>In the book, Dracula enters England only to feast and to create more Nosferatu. In the movie version, Dracula moves to London to gain the love of her long since deceased wife's reincarnation (Jonathan Harker's bride-to-be, (Wilhel)Mina).<br/><br/>I found the movie version much better than the book and nearing the end found myself wishing that Mina and Dracula would have each other - even at the expense of future human lives. I don't know what that says about me as a person, or about the movie but damn.<br/><br/>The music, the cinematography and the acting is all superb, with the not so minor exception of Keanu Reeves who is doing his best cardboard cutout impression during what little screen time he is offered as Jonathan Harker.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins absolutely shines as Dr. Van Helsing, a most likely insane or at the very least quirky Dutch doctor and scientist. He is an absolute joy to watch in this movie, even though his accent and repeated use of the word 'Ja' can get a bit jarring.<br/><br/>Never the less, it is Gary Oldman as Vlad Tepes, Vlad The Impaler, Count Dracula, Nosferatu - that steals the spotlight. His take on Dracula is touching, as a man who lost his love centuries ago and is willing to even renounce God to gain the power to have her back. <br/><br/>You must see this movie, do NOT miss it."
"secondtake","7","2","4","9 June 2010"," Glorious film-making but awkward storytelling, a wobbly epic
","Dracula (1992)<br/><br/>Well, I know this is the holy grail of Dracula movies for some people, and it really is luminous, dazzling, epic, and original. Coppola is a fabulous director at his best, but his movies have been up and down (very very up and somewhat down, of course), and this is big big budget effort, and it might actually strain from its own weight. It really is an attempt to give the legend a seriously timeless treatment, taking on a complicated layering of story lines and some unbelievable set design.<br/><br/>But it's also a pastiche, a collage of references and clichÃ©s, and downright filmic excess. To that extent it's a kind of comic book version, trading realism for heightened and simplified effects. It's bloated and in fact probably needed to be longer to make sense of some of the narrative confusions and abrupt edits. <br/><br/>There are moments, to be sure, of amazing period sets and costumes. And moments of sheer beauty, with of a kind of time-travel wonder that makes it worth watching. Gold Oldman for me may be a good actor (in the way Keanu Reeves is not) but he lacks some kind of cutting charisma necessary for a real Dracula. Other stars illuminate their scenes well--Anthony Hopkins (with a stilted accent) and Winona Ryder (impeccable)--and the supporting cast is perfect for the flavor of the film. Even Tom Waits, whose role is more Monty Python absurdism than anything, fits in to the glitziness (and bloodiness) overall.<br/><br/>So, what to say? This will wow a lot of people, and rightfully. It's romantic in a galactic way. It has fast camera and glorious front to back focus and lighting effects to make the most ordinary scenes come alive. And there are not ordinary scenes. This is, by any account, an extraordinary movie, to be enjoyed for the sheer gluttonous tactile feel."

Gary Oldman made a great Dracula and Ryder played the heroine well. Just after his success in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Anthony Hopkins actually plays the hero Van Helzing in a very astute acting style.<br/><br/>There are homages that actually quite recognizable in other, better known films. The vomiting of the blood in the THE EXORCIST, the immediate slayings similar to THE OMEN and even a nod to the 1930's Dracula.<br/><br/>All in all, a good work by Coppola and gang. It's a little distant and Keanu Reeves isn't given a lot to do but that's not unusual. Fourth billed, still not yet the major star he would become.<br/><br/>I have read the book and Bram Stoker has a very melodramatic style as was it was with the Victorians. This movie generally does follow the book's part though I believe some liberties were taken in the end to give Ryder a really good scene as well as being cinematic."
"dr_foreman","4","2","4","5 March 2007"," This Dracula bites
","Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula is a curious thing. The movie is faithful to the book's storyline, sure, but it completely subverts the morality of the book at the same time. So, in the end, I'd have to say that it's not really faithful at all.<br/><br/>The trouble is that the book is pretty conservative, and this movie is not. Dracula is not depicted as a romantic hero by Stoker, nor is the count a sexual liberator of repressed young Victorian girls. He's a demon parasite, basically, and he corrupts Mina and Lucy, he doesn't free them from the confines of their society or show them the true meaning of love. Therefore, the whole thread in this movie about Mina being Dracula's long-lost wife is clumsily grafted onto the source material, and it's clearly not at all what Stoker intended.<br/><br/>Even if you can ignore the original book and its old-time morality, this movie is still lame. In addition to being unfaithful, the romantic storyline is ridiculously over-the-top and corny. I think Winona Ryder is terrible as Mina - passionless and dull - and she doesn't generate any heat with Gary Oldman. Speaking of heat, I don't think Oldman is as attractive as Frank Langella, nor is he as mysterious as Bela Lugosi or as imposing as Christopher Lee. In other words, Oldman makes a pretty poor Dracula, and watching him traipse around Victorian London in a goofy top-hat and blue-tinted sunglasses is sad indeed. So much for the Prince of Darkness, huh? <br/><br/>The rest of the casting is pretty bad, too. Keanu Reeves is, like everyone says, painfully wooden as Harker. Richard E. Grant and Tom Waits, meanwhile, hit the total opposite end of the spectrum and ham it up like crazy. Worst of all, though, is Anthony Hopkins as a kind of perverse, religious lunatic version of Van Helsing. The character is supposed to be, y'know, a beacon of morality or something - not an old pervert who enjoys hacking up young women. In the book, Lucy and Mina are quite fond of him; in this movie, they're creeped out by his weirdness. And who can blame them? <br/><br/>One of these days, I suppose somebody will make a definitive version of Dracula, but this ain't it. The BBC's 1977 ""Count Dracula"" is much more faithful than this over-the-top nonsense; meanwhile, 1958's ""Horror of Dracula"" is a lot more fun (and spiritually faithful to the book), and Werner Herzog's 1979 version of ""Nosferatu"" is quite poetic and beautiful. All of these films are more satisfying to me than Coppola's bloody awful mess."

","Bram Stoker's tale of Dracula was never like this: an 1890s realtor is kept prisoner in the Count's castle while the vampire covets and stalks his fiancée (who is perhaps the reincarnation of a lost love) and her best friend (who proves to be just a snack). Anthony Hopkins is a half-cocked Van Helsing, Gary Oldman is the Vampyr as a Punk Rocker. Outre theatrics, imaginative camera-tricks courtesy director Francis Ford Coppola, but this is hardly a landmark retelling. Plenty of visual foreplay, but what the film lacks is a narrative that makes sense to us and doesn't shut us out.

","This version has several moments of cinematic wit and occasional visual brilliance but it's mostly hokey, pokey and thoroughly overblown. Gary Oldman is much the best actor in an uneven crew with several of the supporting players making NO impression whatsoever (like vampires I guess). The effect is like having cardboard cut-outs standing around in place of characters. Anthony Hopkins doesn't even bother to use his Dutch accent in several scenes but reverts to his best ""Remains of the Day"" Brit voice. The plot meanders and the sheer lavishness of the sets, costumes and cinematography seriously thwarts the somber/horrible mood of the movie over and over. I finally turned off the color on my TV to see if I could get into it a little more. It didn't help enough to make me feel any better about it. I'm mystified that this movie enjoys such a great popular reputation. This movie must have cost a fortune yet doesn't hold a candle to the cheapie black and white Spanish language version of Universal's ""Dracula"" shot after hours on the sets being used for the Bela Lugosi version."

","I agree with many of the previous postings, however there are some aspects which I found particularly disappointing. Many have spoken of the special effects, and many of Stoker's interest in the heart of the characters and the role of fate. Which is why I was so disappointed with the film's tendency toward cheap effects, i.e., torrents of blood, visions of corpuscles (ridiculous!). I love Coppola and most of the actors in the film. I love the book. Oldman, no. Give me Frank Langela or Christopher Lee or even the over-the-top Bela (in his day he was quite frightening). Oldman was too much like the goofy special effects: a cartoon-ish second-rate guess at what Stoker wrote so perfectly. Though I am not a film maker I don't see what was so difficult with following Stoker's vision and using his words. Especially with regard to the characters. Count Dracula was mysterious, subtle and stylish - that was the attraction for both men and women. And yes, our Mina and the other male heroes were so flimsily portrayed as compared to their characters in the novel that it made this film a shadow of the Stoker story. Give me a Hammer Studios version of the Count over this one! How could anyone find Oldman attractive? Especially as the ""old man"" version of Dracula! I did enjoy the sets, costuming, the score, and some of the acting - hence my rating."

","Francis Ford Coppola robots gush about this and that is fine. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula. The X's and O's are the same in some spots but the movie's message is just not like the book's. First off, the movie is anti-Catholic church and reaches for the pathetic plot point that Dracula became a dark vampire because of the church and that it was the church's fault. Typical Hollywood to try and attack the church and pass it off as a man's novel, a man who is long since dead and can't defend himself. Second, the ridiculous plot that has Mina being Dracula's long lost soul mate is also not in the book. That this movie can't follow a simple point that Dracula is the villain and not the hero, as the movie maintains, is pathetic. The movie is manipulative, Hollywood bilge. By the way, the scenes of beastiality (Dracula ""giving it"" to Lucy are also not in the book.<br/><br/>In the book, Dracula merely drains Lucy and is his typical ""man dressed in black self."" Mina and Lucy kissing are also not in the book. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula in that the message is closer to hardcore pornography then Stoker's God loving novel. If Hollywood wants to produce this weird mess than that is fine as that is it's choice. But saying that it is Bram Stoker's Dracula when it clearly is not is nothing but cheap plagiarism. The movie is nicely filmed otherwise but Winona Ryder is awful and confused here. Gary Oldman is great but Hopkins' Van Helsing is a goof and an outsider.

I'm certain that in the hundreds of reviews of this movie by other users, nearly every unfaithful scene has been dissected ad nauseum, so I will keep it short: if you are looking for a faithful adaptation, this is the last place you'll want to look.

Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves are woefully miscast and their performances (and accents) are as bad as expected but the super lusty Sadie Frost as Lucy is a true over the top gem and Anthony Hopkins brings life and humor to the Van Helsing character.<br/><br/>What is great about this film is its visual lushness, the tension building score and the melodrama.  I enjoyed that the count's past was explored and the timeless romantic connection between he and Mina was interesting.   Some people have a difficult time with Gary Oldman in the role of the vampire (it's probably the hot cross bun hairdo) but Oldman brings a sensual intensity to everything he does and he gives a unique and passionate portrayal of the lovesick count.<br/><br/>Dracula's renouncing of god, Harker's seduction by the brides, Lucy's being ravished by the count/wolf and the chase to beat the sunrise are all great scenes that I could watch again and again.  <br/><br/>Adding Bram Stoker's name to the title was probably done in an effort to distinguish this Dracula film from the numerous other versions.  It could just as easily have been called Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula.  It is no more faithful to the novel than other versions have been and there's nothing wrong with that considering how lackluster the book is.<br/><br/>Coppola's version is not as scary as the original Nosferatu, not as poetic as Werner Herzog's remake and not as enduring as the Bela Lugosi version but it is arguably more entertaining than all of them put together."

"Dengar","10","2","4","4 June 2003"," A masterpiece of cinema...
","My jaw dropped when I read some of these reviews of Dracula (1992). It seems the things people attack in it are things they do not have a background in. The medieval warfare plot is present in the film, because Vlad Dracula was a very real prince in the 15th century Wallachian state bordering Transylvania. In fact, the opening scene is depicted action for action with what happened historically, save for the blood gushing from the cross of course. Bram Stoker drew upon this historical character to drive his novel, for all the baggage such a figure would bring to the plate. As for the rest of the film, the look and style is very rooted in the Symbolist style of the period. In fact, many, many images in the film directly copy well-known Symbolist paintings to a tee. When the dreamy Symbolist style was not being employed, previous incarnations of Dracula on film are referenced. The independent shadow you mention was used in the first Dracula film, Nosferatu (1922). The special-effects employed were all limited to what was available to filmmaking at the time the novel takes place, using puppets, scrims, double-processing, et cetera.  <br/><br/>  The use of absinthe and filmmaking (two great diversions of Stoker's day), were employed to draw up a parallel between themselves and vampirism. I am not going to go into detail how filmmaking parallels it here, but if you are wondering, go watch Shadow of the Vampire for a detailed example. Absinthe drew many under its dreamlike catatonic spell, and as a result of its potency at the time, destroyed many lives, despite its allure. Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of the greatest artistic accomplishments to come out of Hollywood, and I think, the most beautiful. The stagey acting style mimics the many stage adaptations, as well as the fevered sense of the novel. Add to that the most beautiful costumes, wonderful makeup design, what is perhaps the greatest musical score in cinema history, and it all adds up to be a masterpiece.

","Is incredible to see how many people thinks about Dracula just like a Horror movie, I my opinion is more a Romance Film than a Horror movie. I have read the book, and is really disapointing if you have see the movie before. The narrative plot of the movie is a lot better than the used in the book. The make-up and Costumes of Gary Oldman are really outstanding, and the performances are amazing. If you want to get really scared go and see The Shining or Psycho, but If you want to see a Goth Romance movie, then Coppola's Dracula is for you. I'm really shocked with a review telling Keanu Reeves best perfomances are done in SPEED (?) and Matrix (maybe), have you ever seen A Walk in The Clouds or Devil's Advocate??? Speed is a wasting-time movie, a typical action movie, but this performance in Dracula has all the elements for a very good performance. Dracula is more than an Adaptation, is more than a Horror movie, is a conception about the Legend and the romantic implications of it, and Coppola (agains) do it at his best. Thanks."

Never thought I'd rate Winona but she really delivers the goods in this one and of course, another great performance from Gary O in the days before blockbusters were the only time you saw him (damn).

","Dracula's success rides on three things:<br/><br/>1) The strength of Oldman's performance, which reaches almost superhuman depths. 2) The romantic re-telling of Stoker's classic story. 3) The lush, heady art direction which permeates the brain like an opium-induced stupor.<br/><br/>The sexual intonations of Stoker's original plot are brought to the forefront here. Coppolla's film is more a bourgeois erotic fantasy with a supernatural backdrop, but it is so visually splendid that it is impossible not to be swept away with it.<br/><br/>Of course it has it's flaws, the most notable being the unforgivable miscasting of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan, who doesn't seem to understand the words coming out of his mouth and acts as though he warped straight out of 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'. His scenes are cringe-worthy. Winona Ryder, while not as bad, is similarly unconvincing with a British accent that would be tolerable only in an 8th grade school play.<br/><br/>The other members of the cast are admirable. Oldman literally sucks the scenery dry and oscillates masterfully between ice cold malevolence and warm passionate tenderness. Hopkins is comedic camp as Professor Van Helsing. Sadie Frost is scintillatingly cheeky as the precocious Lucy. Tom Waits is hysterical as Renfield. And Monica Belucci's breasts are divinely inspired.<br/><br/>A flawed classic."

This, together with altered ending, the story on board the ship, the invention of the green luminous cloud to explain Dracula's ability to enter closed rooms, leaves little basis for the claim of faithfulness.<br/><br/>Many of the traditional details of the Dracula story are given the briefest nod, or omitted: (1) Dracula does not ever turn into a bat (2) the business of mirrors not showing the images of vampires is not used in the story (3) the business of vampires not being able to stand daylight is very much weakened (4) the effect of showing the cross to stop the vampires is very weak (5) the business of using garlic to ward off vampires is also much weakened (6) the business of using consecrated hosts to control the vampire is also practically gone.<br/><br/>There are many other completely unnecessary alterations of the original: (a) the relationship of Lucy and Mina (b) the disappearance of the character of the mother (c) the death of Renfield.<br/><br/>The most objectionable invention is the ability of Dracula to change his appearance from the wrinkled old man to a handsome man at the peak of his virility who functions in daylight and has restaurant dates with the beautiful Mina.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the version I saw (two hours and some minutes) suffered from a lack of continuity exacerbated by capricious editing montages.<br/><br/>Summarizing, great visuals, directed with a smooth pace, very talented actors, and better than average, but somehow disappointing."
"Flak_Magnet","7","0","0","10 September 2009"," A deeply flawed, but periodically excellent rendition
","This film features terrific art direction & costuming, but suffers from uneven acting performances and overzealous use of digital effects. Overall, Coppola's ""Dracula"" isn't a terrible film, but it isn't a great one, and nearly every scene has some noticeable flaw. Perhaps most importantly, many of the acting performances are simply not convincing. (Read: Keanu Reeves and Wynona Rider). In addition, Coppola seems insistent on oversaturating the viewer with Judo-Christean and sexual symbolism that, all too often, comes across as hamfisted and gratuitous. I think Coppola could have done more with less in this area. On the positive, Gary Oldman provides a fresh and multi-dimensional performance as the Count and Anthony Hopkins makes for probably the best Van Helsing I've seen. Lastly, I thought several of the scenes were very well conceived and totally memorable. The result is a very unbalanced, somewhat messy, but wholly entertaining piece that is, at times, unintentionally funny and, at other times, completely terrific. The script is, I'm told, quite true to Bram Stoker's novel and it should appease those seeking a more faithful adaptation. In total, Coppola's ""Dracula"" is one of the best recent adaptations of the famous Dracula story. It isn't perfect, by any means, but it definitely isn't garbage. ---|--- Reviews by Flak Magnet"
"slothropgr","7","0","0","15 April 2008"," A visual treat but woefully miscast--and plagiarized without credit
","A floridly stylized and overheated, even operatic (Italian opera of course, this being Coppola) take on the book, but one of the most faithful. Gorgeously designed and visualized, yet it barely survives its casting. Did FFC really think that Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were the best available?? On the one hand Ryder handles the complexities of Mina's character (far greater than in the book) well, while Reeves is as wooden and inarticulate as ever, but neither can do an English accent to save their lives. Coppola underlines this lack by pitting them against authentic Brits like Sadie Frost and Tony Hopkins' cheerfully demented Van Helsing. The other Yank, Tom Waits as Renfield, does much better. The real casting disaster is Gary Oldham's Drac. Coppola and Hart have re-imagined this monster into one of the great Romantic (in the Byronic sense) characters, a combination of Richard the Lionheart, Don Juan, Faust and the Flying Dutchman, yet he's played by a rather plain, short and strange character (in the definitely non-Byronic sense) actor who tries so hard to avoid imitating Lugosi that his accent is possibly the ugliest in movie history, and sillier than Kevin Costner's attempt at a Back Bay drawl in ""13 Days."" Where was Daniel Day Lewis? Anyone check with Patrick Bergin or Stephen Rea? Oldman is fine as Old Weird Drac in the castle but my girlfriend (a sucker for romance at all costs, see my review of ""GWTW"") began shaking her head the moment he started playing up to Mina in London, and by the end of the flick had developed a crick in her neck. Too bad, too--the forbidden romance, which BTW was ripped off from the protean Dick Matheson's version with Jack Palance (which he took from the Karloff ""Mummy""), works well to unify a story that sprawls all over the place, and gives the ending real power. I'll close with a note on the DVD: the 5.1 is particularly effective in the castle, with creepy little scratchings and whispers and sounds all over the back channels. And the Coppola commentary is fine, he indulges in much less whining than in his ""Godfather"" apologia. ADDENDUM: According to his commentary, Ryder brought Coppola onto the picture, so she was a given. Too bad they couldn't get her a decent dialog coach to give her a Brit accent at least as good as Angelina Jolie's, if not the quality of Lisa Eichhorn in ""Cutter's Way"" whom I was amazed to find was a Yank, not a Brit."

","First of all, I haven't read the book. This is a movie I watched in 2008. The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about this movie is ""great parts, doesn't hold too well as a whole"". Why is that?<br/><br/>Great parts: there is no single scene I disliked in the whole movie; everything is presented in a rather pleasant, artistic way. There is no need to further describe why those scenes are so interesting, many have done it before.<br/><br/>Questionable as a whole: when I watch a movie, what I am looking forward to is being told a decent story in an entertaining or at least interesting way. This movie was certainly entertaining and interesting.<br/><br/>Was the story decent? I would almost be tempted to reply ""what story?"". I won't even bother to mention the aspects of the ""story"" I disliked or didn't understand. There is no reasonable character development and the transitions between scenes are so unclear. I ended up guessing what was happening, but the movie itself does not explain anything.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I did not care about the characters and I didn't fully understand the motives behind their actions.<br/><br/>May be the best way I can describe this movie is by saying ""a 2 hour-long trailer"".<br/><br/>I'm thrilled, looking forward to a version of this that will explain what is happening.<br/><br/>I gave this 7 out of 10. I could have given 8, or 6, this doesn't matter. I enjoyed it, but feel it could be so much deeper, because as others have mentioned here, each scene might carry some depth, but as a whole, it doesn't.<br/><br/>On a final note, other words that come to my mind when I think about this movie are ""sadly empty"". ""Empty"" because there isn't a decent story and ""sadly"" because I really wish I could understand those amazing characters. Isn't it awful not to be able to feel compassion for the ones in pain? May be this was made on purpose, I don't know."
"pninson","6","0","0","11 October 2007"," Good adaptation, up to a point
","This should really be called Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula. Although it follows Bram Stoker's story more closely than any other Dracula movie I've seen (except the 1977 BBC TV series with Louis Jourdan), it adds a romantic subplot that throws the story off kilter and threatens to turn a horror film into a soap opera.<br/><br/>It's soap opera, really, that's responsible for this. ABC's daytime serial ""Dark Shadows"", which ran from 1966 to 1971, featured the vampire Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid), whose true love died in the 18th century. Released into the 20th century, Barnabas immediately encountered Maggie Evans, a dead ringer for his lost Josette (and played by the same actress). Although originally intended as a standard monster character, to be disposed of after a few weeks, the tragic dimension made Barnabas a pop culture icon and forever infected vampire films with a romantic counterpoint.<br/><br/>Coppola's film opens with a depiction of the ""historical"" Dracula, Prince Vlad of Wallachia. After slaughtering a horde of Turks, he comes home to find his bride dead, and immediately turns into a wimp. He reacts, essentially, like a guest on Oprah. He renounces God, and turns into a vampire.<br/><br/>Now we catch up with Stoker's story, as Jonathan Harker embarks on his journey to Castle Dracula. The vampire sees Jonathan's portrait of his fiancée Mina Murray. Of course, she is a dead ringer for Dracula's lost love.<br/><br/>The problem with this humanizing of Dracula is similar to what Thomas Harris did to Hannibal Lecter in ""Hannibal."" By ""explaining"" Hannibal, Harris turned him from a monster into an anti-hero, a misunderstood figure whose childhood trauma ""drove"" him to become a monster.<br/><br/>What Coppola does here with Count Dracula is not much different. Dracula may be a monster, but now he's humanized, he's a tragic figure, we're supposed to feel sorry for him. And this almost succeeds in completely ruining what is otherwise a decent picture.<br/><br/>Stoker's Dracula was like the original Hannibal Lecter: murderous, unremittingly evil, powerful, uncontrollable, furious, raging, terrifying. The revised versions, so to speak, are still bad, but no longer as horrifying. They've just had unhappy childhoods.<br/><br/>The vampire-as-tragic-figure theme worked well in Dark Shadows because it hadn't been done before. And that was a daytime soap, which was never real horror. Other vampire films have used the romantic angle effectively without making the vampire a figure of pathos, but Coppola's film goes way over the top and drains the story of tension and genuine drama.<br/><br/>Still, this is a well-made, enjoyable film, if a little flat in places. I'm glad to have it in my collection as I love all things Dracula. However, it would have been more effective if Dracula were allowed to remain the beast, the pure, unremitting, unrepentant, unredeemable evil he is meant to be."

","A grave testimony to the importance of good acting even when all the other elements of a classic film are accounted for. ""Dracula"" 1992 comes damn close to having been the definitive screen realisation. It is, indeed, the only realisation to date which bothers to take a detailed, textured look at the Late Victorian period, which is richly detailed in the novel, and for that alone deserves commendation. The cinematography is lavish, and mostly very effective, although the lack of actual location filming becomes a mite conspicuous. Wojciech Kilar's score is even more effective, and generates most of the real emotion in the film, and here our problems begin...<br/><br/>In spite of a first-rate cast, there are no real stand-out performances, though Gary Oldman just about manages to carry every scene he is in. This is just as well, as Winona Ryder acts the part of his beloved with a terrible lack of conviction. Keanu Reeves has come in for a lot of criticism, and although it ought to be said that the screenwriter's conception of Jonathan Harker - as a weak-willed wet blanket - does not exactly give him a gift of a role, his delivery of certain lines (especially those requiring anger) is so unbelievably artificial it is a wonder that no-one demanded re-takes. Anthony Hopkins fares a little better, but fights a losing battle with over-the-top lines. On the other hand, he is good in the quieter moments, and provides some welcome macabre humour. Aside from Gary Oldman, the best performances are provided by Richard E. Grant and Tom Waits, who have full license to camp it up as a morphine-addicted doctor and his deranged patient. These roles are not, however, anywhere near as prominent as the aforementioned, and the film is often at its best when the actors have their mouths firmly shut and we can enjoy the music, design, and gloriously simple yet surreal visual effects (there is, thankfully, hardly any use of CG) on their own merits.<br/><br/>A cinematographic masterpiece, but - as drama - it veers from the acceptable (at best) to the banal (all too frequently). A gorgeous spectacle, nevertheless, but by no means an actors' film."

","There's something about Dracula story that anyone could not know? Johnathan Harker travels to Transilvania to help a noble to move to London. Unluckily, this noble is Dracula, the vampire, the Undead; and, as he sees a picture of John's fiancée (mina), he falls in love and decides that she must be for him. He move to London and there he fights with JOhn's friends in order to conquer Mina's heart. Said for someone as a terror film, actually is a very good love story with a very dark environment and, of course, a great quantity of violence. This violence, though, is totally needed for the story, which makes it more interesting. The actors are great, so as the make-up. Gary Oldman dressed as Dracula is totally astonishing. Despite it is 2 hours and a half long, it never seems so long and time passes quickly as the film continues; while you are involved into a precious dark love story beyond death."

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","0","0","30 December 2005"," Far from great but better than its reputation
","Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula has one major problem: some abysmal casting. Most obviously you have Keanu Reeves, but there's also Sadie Frost and Cary Elwes to help bring it down.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure what was going on in Coppola's head when he cast Reeves (in later interviews he's admitted he did it to attract young women and that he regrets his decision), but you'd be hard pushed to find a worse performance. I'm sure even nativity plays display greater acting talent. But Reeves really does nearly ruin the whole thing, especially as much of the early part of the film rests upon his shoulders. But how can you take seriously a character who sounds like he comes from London, California (I always expect him to say, ""Woah, Dracula dude"")? And how can you loose yourself in a performance that equates jerky head movements as the sole trait of the upper middle classes? It really is rather embarrassing and hard to watch; I even sometimes hide behind my hands, not at the horror in the film but as a man more wood than flesh tries to convey emotion. But having said that, there is one moment where Reeves convinces: the bit where Dracula sacrifices a baby to his three whorish vampires. All Reeves has to do is scream and he actually manages to do it half convincingly. It's just too bad the role required more than that.<br/><br/>Nowhere near as bad as Reeves, but still rather annoying is Sadie Frost as Lucy, Mina's friend. And the reason she grates is rather simple: she has an annoying voice. I don't really know how to describe it, but the sound is as uncomfortable to listen to as hearing someone scraping their teeth with a rusty file. And she also has the most terrible head of ginger hair. She looks Spuggie out of Byker Grove. But she's fine in the non-speaking bits. You know, the bits where she's getting nailed by a wolf beast and having her throat ripped out. There she's okay.<br/><br/>Then there's Cary Elwes. The man has no genuine acting talent, therefore it's rather hard to try and watch him act tough and be a romantic hero. His worst moment is when Lucy is having a blood transfusion and he flings the doors open, asking what's going on. He's trying to be authoritative but shouting and exaggerated macho striding just makes you look like a knob. And he's just as bad when he gets sentimental over Lucy. He says he'd give every last drop of blood for her. He looks like a puppy dog, albeit a puppy dog you got for Christmas and then want to immediately take down Battersea Dogs Home to be destroyed.<br/><br/>And now I think about it, even Winona Ryder isn't that good. There's one bit where she becomes some horny seductress and tries to seduce Hopkins' Van Helsing. She just isn't the least bit convincing. Her seduction technique is about as arousing as putting snails in your pants. And in other moments she looks unconvincing too. However, at other times she's pretty good. It's a very uneven performance.<br/><br/>But despite all the bad performances and all the other shortcomings (the film is really all over the place when in terms of narrative), I still find myself rather enjoying it. I guess the main reason why I'm so lenient is because the visuals are so good. I really do love the way the film looks. And I also the way the film opts for a hyper-sexualised romance over a man in a cape. It at least tries to do something different.<br/><br/>My favourite image in the film has to be the battle at the start. Everything is shot in silhouette, almost as if it's a puppet theatre. And I love the gruesome way that men get stabbed and the way a soldier that's impaled on a spike slides down it while still alive. Brilliant stuff. And then just after that there's a magnificent shot where Dracula's wife jumps out of the castle and falls down to the moat below. It's an awesome piece of visual film-making. However, even in these moments of brilliance, the great has to co-exist with the crap: when Dracula bends over his dead wife, Ryder visibly blinks. It's something that's easy to miss, but once you notice it it becomes infuriating that Coppola didn't.<br/><br/>Other great shots include the emergence of Dracula's coach and the way the horses almost float over the smoke, the shots of Dracula's shadow which has a life of its own, the crazy POV shots of the wolf beast and all the painterly shots of Dracula's castle. It's a film that doesn't give a toss about reality and which is better for it.<br/><br/>But I'm also very forgiving of the film because Gary Oldman is so great as Dracula. He manages to be frightening, amusing and romantic all in one film. It's quite something to watch, especially when most of the actors around him fail dismally to convince. But I love the schizophrenic way that he can go from one extreme to the next. As the razor-licking tit-head Dracula (that's got to be the most bonkers hairstyle ever), he's amusing one moment and unsettling the next. Then as the young Dracula he's charming and romantic. But then as the wolf beast and the giant bat, he becomes monstrous. It pummels every other portrayal of Dracula into the ground. And at the end he even manages to elicit some sympathy for his character, which is no mean feat when he's a blood-sucking madman. But as fantastic as he is, he's let down by those around him. If the film had been cast properly it could have been something really special."

","Vampire films almost by definition are parodies, just as the Victorian-era vampire story is almost by definition a metaphor for repressed sexuality. These run from the obvious (""Fearless Vampire Killers""), to the subtle (""Van Helsing""), to the self-parody (""Bram Stoker's Dracula"").<br/><br/>Coppola's ""Dracula"" is a lush high budget adaptation that bears only a slight resemblance to the Bram Stoker original story. That it takes a major liberty by adding bad history to make the title character sympathetic is forgivable, in part because it adds to the self-parody element and in part because this version still incorporates the enough elements of the original-if somewhat reinterpreted to better align with the sympathetic treatment.<br/><br/>The parody elements begin early when Dracula declares war on God by pushing his sword into a stone cross which then begins to flood the room with blood (yes it is as silly as it sounds). At one point Coppola breaks the conventions of the genre and allows Dracula to walk around in daylight. Dracula's getup for this scene may have been the inspiration for Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka look. The warders in the insane asylum spend their on camera time spraying the patients with fire hoses, and they wear birdcages on their heads while performing this duty. Throughout the film, Coppola and his post-production people parody the overuse of ""match cut"" transitions (i.e. when a light in the current scene cross-dissolves into a fire in the next scene) by other filmmakers. They make almost all transitions into overreaching match cuts. This is all enormous fun to watch but not as much fun as the wild performances by the cast.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman, Sadie Frost, Richard E. Grant, Tom Waits, and Anthony Hopkins all overplay their characters in a nice self-parodying way. They obviously are having a whole lot of fun playing this stuff for laughs. At one point Oldman gets to wear a makeup design that would work well in a Star Trek episode. But Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder act like Coppola forgot to let them in on the joke (unless everyone in the cast is happy because they are laughing at Reeves' lame attempt at a British accent). Reeves is too limited in the talent department to pull out an over-the-top self-parodying performance. Ryder's situation is a little different, her style and strength is playing all her roles as if they are real. Although this works nicely for things like her Veronica character in ""Heathers"", it leaves her at the mercy of the script. Here the Mina character just doesn't have enough complexity to justify Winona's efforts.<br/><br/>Speaking of Winona, she has never looked more desirable than in this film and the same can be said for Sadie Frost. This is ample justification for male viewers to seek out this film. Ryder and Frost even manage a brief passionate kiss during a cloudburst.<br/><br/>There is one wondrously nice sequence where the editor cuts back and forth between Lucy's last encounter with Dracula and Nina's wedding ceremony. It is really a slick bit of film magic and a nice illustration of the sexual nature of the whole vampire genre.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","Gary Oldman IS Dracula. No one before or after even comes close to the brilliance with which Oldman plays the title character. As one of too few I have seen the original Dracula and therefore I have the basis for a comparison and Oldman is far superior but as it is with many of these characters that multiple actors have played the first one is often lauded as being the one and only. This is something I don't understand. People say that Connery was the best to play Bond. Fair enough but he was also the best actor to ever play Bond and the same could be said in the case of Oldman playing Dracula. Bela Lugosi was chosen because of his accent and appearance but in the case of Oldman its pure talent.<br/><br/>Overall the acting in the film is very good. I cannot praise Oldman enough and I simply do not understand he did not even receive an Oscar nomination for the film. His voice and his ability to use different accents (which he does in almost every film I've seen him in) is quite unique and his grasp of timing, posture and facial expressions makes him one of my favorite actors. Winona Ryder is good as well but her performance pales in the scenes she has with Oldman who steals them. Keanu Reeves isn't particularly good but fortunately he isn't in the film enough to ruin anything. The only actor who can match the brilliance of Oldman is the master character actor Anthony Hopkins who like Oldman steals every scene he is in. He said he took the role to do something different from his Hannibal Lecter character and prove his versatility and he does for Abraham Van Helsing is one of the most interesting and weird characters of his career. The supporting cast is pretty good. Nothing stand out but decent.<br/><br/>The film's visual style is very unique and gives off a very unique atmosphere which is both tense and some times frightening at the same time. Mostly though the visual style is just fake and weird and oddly this suits the film very well but it is also a weakness because sometimes its just a little too weird and in those scenes the film lost me only to bring me back again later. I don't blame the actors for my sporadic loss of interest but the direction which is sometimes stellar and sometimes shaky but overall satisfactory. The music and general sound are, like the visual elements, different and atmospheric and very generally very well done.<br/><br/>The story is well told. The film takes its time and builds up the characters in a satisfactory manner and is very good at building up tension to the ending. The ending seems a bit rushed though and is not completely climactic and it is in fact only because of the rushed ending that I do not give this film a 9 because otherwise the style, acting and general storytelling is very well done. All in all Dracula is a very good, entertaining film. It doesn't rival other films that the director has done but it is nevertheless a good interpretation of the book.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Francis Ford Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is the best ""Dracula"" film I have ever seen. I am a huge vampire fan, and have seen all the ""Dracula"" films. None can compare to the ""new story"" (Vlad Dracula), scenery, or feel that you receive from watching it. Anthony Hopkins gives a stand out performance as Professer Van Helsing. He is both dramatic and comedic. Sadie Frost gives a lasting impression as the doomed Lucy Westerna. She gives a new look and feel to the character that has never been done before. She is both sexy and vulnerable. Winona Ryder gives her best performance as Mina Murray Harker, who falls for the charming Count. Gary Oldman has never been better as the vampire Count, as he changes from old & decrepit to wolf to hunk to bat... Keanu Reeves gives a mediocre performance as Jonathan Harker. He only stands out in the ""steamy"" sex scene with Dracula's brides. Coppola directs this film as a masterpiece, and it is in every word."

","I really liked this movie. The only problem I had with it was that Keanu Reeves played one of the main characters. He didn't really suit it I found. But what was lost on his behalf got redeemed with Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder. Their chemistry on screen was amazing. Gary Oldman actually makes a believable accent for Dracula(I'd like to mention someone from Van Helsing, but I won't), and Winona Ryder did a great job of being scared, and being attracted to Dracula. One other thing was that I was pleasantly surprised to see Cary Elwes in this movie. He was cool. In fact, all of Lucy's ""boyfriends"" were good in this. Two thumbs way way up for a movie that is a classic in my mind."

","WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOiLERS so if you haven't seen this movie yet or read Bram Stoker's classic book you may not want to read this review! The Dracula book by Bram Stoker is great and I have seen some movie versions which includes this one which is Coppola's take on it which he titled Bram Stoker's Dracula and with a title like that you may be mislead into thinking it's going to be totally faithful to the book but it isn't. It's more faithful than all the other great Dracula movies but has added things like the whole thing with Elizabeta and there are some gross scenes like a sleepwalking Lucy having sex with Dracula who has transformed himself into a wolf. The scene with the baby and Dracula's 3 brides was very disturbing too but that was in the book but it was more disturbing in the movie! I must admit to screaming NO when I saw that scene in this movie! The acting in this movie was great, Gary Oldman was superb as Dracula and I'm surprised that he doesn't get the recognition that he deserves. Anthony Hopkins was great too as the eccentric Van Helsing but I think he played him even nuttier than he was in the book and the character was almost psychotic. Wynona Ryder was a good Mina except I think she could have worked a little on her imitation of a British accent, it was rather weak but her acting was great. Keanu Reeves was good as Jonathan Harker and honestly I don'think his imitation of a British accent was that bad and I think his accent was better than Wynona's. The guy who played Renfield was good but not quite as good as Peter McNichol played Renfield in the Mel Brook's spoof Dracula Dead and Loving it! The actress playing Lucy was very pretty but unfortunately was very annoying especially with all her scenes where she was moaning and groaning and when I was watching the DVD I said aloud a couple of times oh shut up and just shut her up! Though this movie is not totally faithful to the book I still recommend it to fans of the book and fans of Dracula movies though I have to take points off for the weird scene of Lucy and Dracula morphed into a wolf creature! EEEEEWWWWWW!"

","As good as this film is it disappoints me because of all the things they leave out. It's almost like they read the book then thought 'Okay this time skip half the chapters' The trouble with skipping so much of the finer points of the book is that we get a disjointed film. It feels as though it's rushing through a story that has to be told slowly. Every detail in the book is there for a reason. The film however just throws the main points at us. For example: The film makes no mention of the many hours Lucy and Mina sit on an old bench in Whitby. In fact the bench outside the abbey on the cliff is completely removed from the film. The book details a beautiful scene where Lucy sleepwalks to the bench where her and her close friend spent many happy hours. Mina follows out into the dark night in search of her friend. high upon a darkened cliff where the small bench where she has sat on many occasions she see's her friend being apparently molested by a darkened dread filled figure. Mina loses sight for only a second and when she looks again the figure has apparently vanished. In the film we get Lucy sleepwalking into her garden and having sexual intercourse with a wolfman. <br/><br/>Another disappointment was that a lot of what Johnathan Harker goes through at Dracula's castle is cut out. They glide over the first 30% of the book and just throw topless women at us instead.<br/><br/>It's a shame that they didn't just film what was in the book and set it out just as the book does. The book is in diary format this would translate very easily onto a screen. Each diary entry being a scene.<br/><br/>I would say that this is yet another case of ""The book is better than the movie""<br/><br/>Paul Fletcher"

","This movie is not for all tastes. Fans of the book will probably hate this movie for using Bram Stoker's name in the movie title even though it has more to do with copyright laws than on what source the movie is based upon. I've heard that the movie isn't exactly faithful to the book as it would lead most movie goers to believe. Other movie fans used to popcorn thrills and slasher films will probably be bored here as well. They'll find it weird, odd, or strange and there's definitely something off about this movie, something amiss, but it adds to a rewarding viewing experience unlike any other.<br/><br/>I completely love this movie. I love everything about it. The costumes, the set design, the gore, the score, the performances (yes, even Reeves), and the love story. It's one of the rare instances when several things come together and make a film work when it shouldn't. Handled by another director, this movie would have fallen apart and become something resembling Merchant Ivory meets Vampire in Brooklyn.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppolla directs with passion he hasn't had since Apocalypse Now and the original Godfather films. The cast is a mixed bag of sorts: Gary Oldman is at the top of his game as the famous bloodsucker, going from menacing monster to warm blooded lover in no time. Winona Ryder, sensing that she made a mistake ditching FFC in The Godfather, Part III, makes up for her disappointing absence in that film and gives her all here. Her Mina is filled with innocence and lust, and we feel for her towards the end of the film when her loss is unlike what we originally expected. <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is in scenery chewing mode as Van Helsing, but brings great presence to a movie much in need of a balancing force compared with Oldman's Dracula. The two actors play off one another when they aren't even on screen together, but it seems like one always knows the other is there. Keanu Reeves might have a terrible accent and look really dumb with frosted gray hair, but he fits into the odd cast as a wooden and terrified Jonathan Harker, and also offers a nice contrast with Oldman's Dracula. Hint: After seeing Reeves as Harker, we now know why Mina might want to run off with Dracula. There isn't going to be much passion or excitement in Harker's bedroom.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a brave and daring film, unlike most movies that were made after the summer blockbuster was invented. Not for all tastes, this movie will reward the fans and disappoint others, but for those who enjoy it, it will stay with them forever."
"MovieFreak4702","8","0","0","22 April 2005"," A very different Dracula, and maybe the best
","This was a film that I had heard about forever but never gave it a shot. I had heard that Gary Oldman was absolutely terrific in this, and after seeing him in State of Grace I needed a fix. Well, to my surprise, this film worked. It could have been better but it worked well otherwise. My favorite aspect of this film was that it was much more of a love story, and gave you more insight into who Dracula was. This version of the story also made me sympathize with Prince Vlad, and showed me the romance that went along with the story of Dracula, and not so much of all the blood sucking myth.<br/><br/>For those of you that love the blood sucking vampire movies, don't worry, there's still plenty here. I've seen more in other films, but there is a good amount in this film. Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as Van Helsing, although at times he seemed to be playing the insanity card in such a way that it was un-believable. He was still very convincing and a nice casting choice for the movie.<br/><br/>After Bela Lugosi, it's hard to imagine Dracula being anyone, but Gary Oldman made me see Dracula in a way that I never did before, as a human. A human with a past, and feelings, and emotions that most people have but are able to get over. I don't want to ruin anything for people who haven't seen this movie yet but I will say this, after Gary Oldman, there is no other Dracula. The man deserved an Academy for this role, but of course was denied because the Academies suck, but that's another story. Definitely check this one out, if only to see a different Dracula than what you've seen before, just don't take it too seriously.<br/><br/>Rating:"

","With more than a nod to 'Carry on Screaming' Francis Ford Coppola's production of the Stoker classic goes for high camp, pressing fangs firmly in cheek as all involved are directed to ham it up something spectacular. Or so it would seem.  This film proved to be a surprise success for Coppola -- who during the previous decade had more turkeys than a supermarket at thanksgiving -- which in hindsight isn't surprising at all really, since Coppola has done what many a washed-up filmmaker has done when desperate for a hit... aim for the lowest common denominator.<br/><br/>Here Coppola directs like a man who hasn't been given this much studio leeway for the best part of his career, piling on the gore and visual effects and rushing things along with all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop.  An a-list cast of Hollywood young bloods try their hand at a British accent... and fail miserably (note: not everyone in Britain speaks like the Queen), whilst Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman's German accents elicit the kind of laughs today's comedians could only dream of.  It's all a hideous mess... but an entertaining mess.  The quick pace, Coppola's lush visuals and the unintentional comedic elements add up to a fully enjoyable experience.  Even if the mid-section seriously lags.<br/><br/>Amongst the standout sequences are Oldman's crotchety old Dracula morphing into a hulking great werewolf creature and raping Sadie Frost.  Hopkins methods of decapitation take the actor into realms of overacting that he wouldn't return to until Red Dragon ten years later.   Plus, we also have future Matrix reloaded star Monica Bellucci popping up... and popping out, as she reveals her breasts to plays one of three seductive vampire queens. Not exactly high-art then.  Despite the film's would be pretension, this is still an enjoyable slice of over the top guff, with blood spitting women, bug eating Tom Waits and a pre-jail Winona Ryder, Dracula stands as the best thing Coppola has directed for over a decade.  3/4"

Winona Ryder running in a see through dress looked good, but it was followed by a, hmm, some kind of a monster having sex with a woman in the garden. Scene with Gary Oldman licking blood from a razor with which Keanu Reeves' cut himself shaving was absoluetly brilliant.

","I suppose it's impossible to take a great work of classic literature and translate it directly to the screen... look at ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Gone With the Wind"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""... but what's even worse is when the filmmakers don't even try. Such is the way with Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"".<br/><br/>I personally have read Bram Stoker's original novel twice, and each time I read it, I like it even more. The characters are wonderful, the plot is thick and intriguing, the settings are amazing. (It has its problems, sure, but what book doesn't?) And so I set off on the all-too impossible quest to find a movie version of ""Dracula"" that was like the book.<br/><br/>That was my first mistake. My second was thinking that FFC's ""interpretation"" would be the film I was looking for.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not a big FFC fan- I have no idea even what other movies he directed- but if ""Dracula"" was any indication as to his skills as a director... well, I'd say he has none. The scenes were cluttered, ugly, dingy, dark, and far-too gothic for even this story. The characterizations were disgusting (both in appearance and in personality). And the story was chopped to bits.<br/><br/>I suppose that's the main thing that made me dislike the film: The complete departure from the original source material. One part in the book that was about ten pages long (the scene where the ""Demeter"" crashes into the bay) has been suppressed into a single one minute scene, intermingled with other scenes of Mina and Lucy and the wolf escaping from the zoo (also, the whole half-wolf/half-Dracula thing was stupid and sickening and completely uncalled for). On the surface, the idea of having Mina be the reincarnated form of Elisabeta is a cool concept. But after about three minutes after Dracula's arrival in London, it wears terribly thin. Similarly, Lucy has been completely changed. In the book, she was pure, virginal, and sweet-hearted, and that's why everybody loved her so much. In the film, she's been changed to some sort of sex goddess (not to mention she's supposed to be BLONDE). The movie does have two things right about Dr. Seward: He does run an insane asylum and he is battling an addiction to morphine, but he was much more kind-hearted and not such an animal (even to the lunatics) in the book. But what really took the cake was Dracula. He's been transformed from the lord of darkness into a hippie! He doesn't look like he'd strike fear into a kitty cat's heart, much less the whole of London! (unless you concentrate on the hair and the idiotic blue sunglasses... I suppose those were kinda scary)<br/><br/>All in all, the movie stunk. I didn't even finish it, to tell the truth... I was getting too sick of having to avert my eyes from the TV screen to avoid the nudity and too fed up with the butchered story line to continue. I suppose some of the performances were good... but not many. Cary Elwes and Anthony Hopkins were perfect for the parts of Arthur and Van Helsing. Winona Ryder was adequate but not too great. If you've seen one Keanu Reeves role, you've seen 'em all. I guess Lucy and Seward were okay, but Renfield and Quincy were total disappointments all the way around. <br/><br/>So, for all you aspiring filmmakers out there, here are three lessons learned from this monstrocity: 1: If you want to make a movie based on classic literature, read the book first. 2: If you want a large following of fans who loved the book, don't dissect the characters and storyline. And 3: If you want the entire audience to run away screaming, put the most evil being ever to walk the earth, the prince of fear, the lord of darkness, in blue sunglasses."

The fades and special effects editing are also pure eye candy, and the use of miniatures and matte painting backgrounds gives the film a wonderfully nostalgic, Old Hollywood feel.  Sadly, the attention paid to the physical details were not given to the casting and writing.  The dialogue is often stilted, and some of the plot points can zip right past the viewer.  And the only truly scary things to be found in what is essentially a love story with lots of fake blood are Keanu Reeves' and Winona Ryder's truly disgusting British accents.  But, all said, Coppola's DRACULA makes an interesting - if not entirely enjoyable - film.

","*might contain some spoilers* The story of Dracula (a.k.a. Vlad Tepesh) was told in so many different ways, that before seeing this movie you might think :""Oh, great! Fun! Another brainless story about a guy who bites everything that sleeps and eventually somebody feeds him on garlic and he dies."" This version of the story, however, is quite different from the others. First of all, the neck-biting & blood-sucking business is not the core of the movie at all. Of course, it's there, no doubt about that. It's a vampire flick after all. The whole film is centered on a love story: when Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) was young (a few centuries ago) he had a beautiful wife. As a result of unfortunate circumstances his wife finished her life in the river. Dracula became a vamp (as a sign of protest). Of course, this is just the beginning of the heart-breaking story. One day, a salesman (Keanau Reeves) came to Dracula's castle (the Count decided to trade the fresh air of his native mountains for the fog and smog of the 19th century London. Vampires are strange beings.) The salesman's wife-to-be, Mina (Winona Ryder) was the living portrait of Dracula's wife (from the movie we can suppose that she's a little more than a portrait. A reincarnation is more exact a term.) The following events are quite predictable. Dracula goes to London, becomes young in the process and the rest, you'll have to see for yourself. The charm of this movie resides in the characters. Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is absolutely hilarious (and  irritating most of the time) as the cynical, sarcastic doctor. Renfield (Tom Waits) is no less entertaining. Of course Gary Oldman is as great as ever (although his character takes five or six different forms and is sometimes a little difficult to identify). W.Ryder's English accent is quite bad, but it sounds ok compared to K.Reeves' (who is, by the way, the biggest flaw of the movie: not convincing AT ALL) Perhaps the biggest mistake not to commit while watching this movie is to expect something serious. Normally old Dracula's: ""I was told that you were a man of good...taste."" should be enough to convince you that the movie is a little tongue in cheek. If this fails, wait until you see Dracula's clumsy shadow  knocking down ink holders, walking in wrong directions  and misbehaving itself in other different ways.  If even THIS fails to make you smile wait to see (or rather hear) Dr Van Helsing.<br/><br/>In and out, Bram Stoker's Dracula is very pleasant to watch especially since visually it is quite beautiful. A must see if you're a vampire-flick fan."

","I saw Dracula without any expectations as to what the movie would be like - visually or story wise. Now, I would give it an 8 on both counts. One thing this movie has loads of is acting prowess - Anthony Hopkins, Gary Oldman, Richard E. Grant and Winona Ryder - Keanu Reeves is not my personal favorite and it is just as well that his role is subdued, and he promises more than perhaps he is capable of. Gary Oldman morphs between the older and the younger versions of the Count easily. Visually of course this movie borders on the brilliant and chaotic - not that I consider chaos to be a bad thing. Choice of colors and costumes, camera angles and lighting are all brilliant and special effects only enhance the aura, not create it.<br/><br/>One thing that struck me was the beautiful portrayal of the blood sucking brides.

","I love the book ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker and have always hoped for a film version that would do it justice. I realize it's not the easiest novel to translate to film, but still...The biggest mistake (IMHO) that Francis Ford Coppola made was casting Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder as the Harkers. Keanu Reeves plays Jonathan Harker as if he were in need of a good enema. And Winona Ryder (while good in movies like ""Reality Bites"") is clearly out of her depth here. I won't even mention their horrific attempts at English accents...<br/><br/>What saved this film for me was Gary Oldman's sinister yet romantic portrayal of the bloodsucking Count. He made him more a figure of tragedy than horror. Two other factors are the set & costume design--atmospheric, beautiful. Sadie Frost and Tom Waits are a joy to watch. I always wondered about the inclusion of the character ""Quincey Morris"" in Stoker's novel. Was he thinking of his American audience? This guy is a caricature, a Victorian Marlboro Man...which is exactly how Bill Campbell played him. Richard Grant has some good moments as the morphine-addicted Dr. Jack Seward, but those 3 Dracula brides? Puh-leeze!

","This film has two things in its favor. It has terrific production values. More importantly, it has taken the interesting position that the original story, as told in Stoker's novel through a collection of diaries and journals, doesn't tell the ""entire"" story of what happened.  That is, this film says the characters' Victorian sensibilities wouldn't allow them to record all the details exactly as they happened. Unfortunately, this film is marred as it continues the post-Hammer era trend -- now a hackneyed cliche -- of trying to portray Dracula as both a romantic hero and an evil bloodsucking human vampire. You want to portray Dracula as ""too much in love"" with Mina to bite her?  It just doesn't work.

I felt pity, sympathy, disdain, contempt, fear, love and also lust for this creature. Oldman is without doubt the best actor alive (under 50), and that made me love his character even more.  Ryder seemed mis-cast, not to mention Reeves who was terribly mis-cast, stiff as a board as usual. (Why, Cary Elwes would have made a better Jonathan Harker)! Hopkins has been criticized for being ""hammy"", or pompous, but that is what his role called for.  The paths that this film takes you on are many and winding, and Oldman's character is the essence of disguise masters. He was nothing less than brilliant. Very deserving of a nomination at least. I knew I was in love with Prince Vlad when he resisted biting Elisabeta due to his deep love for her.

I think that Francis Ford Coppola has probably left his golden years (The Godfather, etc) behind forever -- he directs this movie as though it were some sort of an MTV music video.  My two main acting (or perhaps casting) gripes are probably with Keanu Reeves and Gary Oldman.  Keanu is his usual deadpan self -- it was to be expected, but I would've liked to see a bit more depth brought to the role.  And Oldman as the Count -- what can I say, he just didn't develop that sense of combined elegance and dread I associate with the character.  Winona Ryder surprised me by being quite fitting in the role of Mina -- also her 'possession' scene is quite well done and probably the creepiest scene in the movie.  Anthony Hopkins is great and over-the-top at the same time, but I think it's what Van Helsing's character requires.  He is dramatic and funny at the same time, and is always a joy to watch (""An autopsy?  Oh no, nothing like that, I just want to cut off her head and take out her heart."").  His scene with Jonathan and Mina at the dinner table is quite funny as well.

Adapting from a literary source naturally requires considerable condensing of plot, characters, etc., but at the very least there should some of the book's essence remaining.<br/><br/>It is absurd and fraudulent to call this movie 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'.  The entire plot about Dracula chasing the reincarnation of his true love is simply not in the original ! It's actually closer to the 1932 film ""The Mummy"".  Stoker's novel has no scenes set in Vlad The Impaler's lifetime. This new film has Dracula as an anti-hero wronged by the hypocrisy of the church, which is obviously a desperate attempt to provide sympathy, and a clear motive for his evil doings.<br/><br/>The sense of the book is that Dracula has no motive beyond the pure evil that has possessed him - his behaviour is an end in itself, a far more horrific scenario than Coppolla'a new age revisionism.  And of course conventional christianity is never presented as villainous or hypocritical by Stoker.<br/><br/>Despite its own considerable departures from Stoker, the 1931 Lugosi film has much more of the spirit and atmosphere of the novel.

From the very flashback beginning, (I have a personal affection for movies with flashbacks) I was captivated, and when seeing the mad who was he again in his cell, rising from the ground all surreal I was practically jumping up and down with excitement. Then came the blow. Keanu Reeves has got to be one of the most overrated actors out there, him and Arnold Shwartznager (sorry if I killed that because I always call him `Shwartzy'). Not only was his face a stone in this movie, like in any other, but his forced, horrible British accent just plain well, come one now, even I could do a British accent better (and I am not saying I am any good at it)! All the other actors were marvelous, especially I enjoyed Hopkins and Ryder. A lot of the art was wonderful in it also such as all the scenes with the Vampire brides and the flowing gowns in the night. Some, however, were rather cheesy such as blood coming from both sides of the screen and green smokeI mean, this just kills the mystical experience of the movie when you have special effects such as that. It makes it feel like some sort of cheep horror flick, and not a good one. The constant show of red blood cells also was a bit too technical and unmystical to be shown, I thought. What should have been done was to have the blood trickle like little snaky rivers over and around things (much more subtle that way), and the smoke to be black rather then that pop green. Perhaps subtleties was another good word to use, the movie lacked it. I would have preferred it more of a drama and less of horror such as Interview With The Vampire. Dracula himself was often portrayed a bit too obviously scary, it would have been better, I thought, had he looked more normal yet had some subtle chilly notes about him. The moving by itself carriage and all such was also a bit too `evil witch of the west'ish. So while some parts of the movie I thought to be exquisite, others I just had to shake my head at. It was almost sad because it could have been a truly wonderful movie had some parts not been there, but with them I would give it (with sadness) a 6.5/10."

Then I happened to watch it again about two years ago and was stunned to find that it seemed a completely different film.  Fortunately I had taped the earlier version and was able to compare it with what I had just seen.  The version currently being shown is most definitely a re-cut. There are a couple of new scenes, but only a couple and I don't think the lengths of the two versions differ by more than a few seconds, but the re-cut is a much better movie - one where the full impact of the story comes through.  I am surprized that the IMDB does not list this re-cut in their Alternate Visions category, but it is most definitely out there and I can only think that, with the vast improvement in the coherence of the movie, this has to be a Director's Cut.

The sets and costumes are stagey and theatrical; and that's the better part of the endeavor. For about half an hour (near the beginning) the movie holds some promise, due to the excellent, strange, imaginative stuff you're being shown (Oldman plays the Count as an over the top empress dowager). But the movie suffers exactly where the Dracula story always does; Jonathan in Transylvania is interesting and eerie. But once the story moves back home to middle-class England, nothing can save it. Characters standing around drawing rooms, figuring out things every audience member already knows about vampires, is impossibly dull; in every single version of this tale.<br/><br/>When it comes to mechanics (Oldman wheeled across a room, licking a razor, shadows performed by a second actor) Coppola is intriguing, but when it comes to effects, compositing, film technology, backwards sequences, editing and script it's all a bag of clichés. The story never deepens or concerns you. The characters never get past two-dimensionality. And all the Dutch angles in the world can't make an exhausted story interesting. The last hour is a seriously uninteresting, half-hearted slog.<br/><br/>The Dracula tale is stale from over-repetition but somehow the movies still get bankrolled. What possible dramatic interest can be plumbed from newb-characters learning what a vampire is? Even with Coppola's gloss on Victorian sexuality and sex-borne pathogens it not interesting. The original Renfield from 1933 is still way creepier than Tom Waits decent effort. Scenes and ideas are lifted straight from other movies (Zentropa, Manhunter)"

","It was the scariest love story I ever saw. The special effects & the actors all worked together into the movie with excellent results. It was not only frightening but also a true love story depicting the pain & suffering of a warrior who lost his love only to find another identical to her but 400 years apart. It gave a clear understanding how ""Dracule"" felt bitterness against the Christian church when the priest would not give last rites to Elizabeta who committed suicide when she believed the lie that her lover was killed in battle. It clearly depicted the possibility of a dark side of life that could possibly consume one's sole for eternity if one gives up on or turns against God. I loved the movie but still do not feel a warm place in my heart for Dracula or Vlad the impaler."
"Coventry","7","2","5","21 March 2018"," Beautiful film, pitiable Dracula character
","Yours truly grew up during the early 90s and thus my first encounters with the classic and immortal horror sagas where the contemporary large-budgeted and bombastic blockbusters of prolific directors that starred a bunch of Hollywood icons. Kenneth Brannagh modernized ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", Francis Ford Coppola revised ""Bram Stoker'""s Dracula"" and, to a lesser extent, there were also Mike Nichols' ""Wolf"" (the updated ""Wolf Man"") and Stephen Frears' ""Mary Reilly"" (basically ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" from a different viewpoint). They're all fine films and I still consider them as essential contributors to my love for the horror genre, but somehow, I wish that I started chronologically with the Universal horrors starring Lugosi, Karloff, Chaney, etc...<br/><br/>This completely personal and irrelevant trivia note aside, Coppola's ambitious and prestigious retelling of ""Dracula"", which remains incredibly faithful to the original Bram Stoker novel, still stands as an overwhelming cinematic achievement. The film is 25 years old already in the meantime, but the decors, costumes, photography, make-up and special effects are still breathtaking even by today's high and sadly digitalized standards. ""Dracula"" is undoubtedly a pure work of art to behold, but putting the emphasis on the vampire count's romantic traumas and his pitiable craving to be reunited with his 15th Century's wife Elizabeta obviously didn't do the horror impact a lot of good. Count Dracula, once a bloodthirsty warrior who turned against God because his beloved wife killed herself, imprisons young attorney Jonathan Harker in his Transylvanian castle after he sees a picture of his fiancée Mina. She seemingly is the reincarnation of Elizabeta and thus Dracula travels to his recently purchased Carfax Abbey in Britain to reclaim her. Mina's best friend Lucy, and then Mina herself, immediately fall for Dracula's hypnotizing charms and mystical powers, but Lucy's three (!) lovers fight back and even call upon the help of the infamous Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. <br/><br/>There's a good reason why Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee are eternally reckoned for their respective roles as Count Dracula; - namely because they depicted him as an evil, invincible and relentless horror monster! Although Gary Oldman still remarkably succeeds in making his Dracula performance somewhat menacing and creepy, the script introduces the lead character as a grieving and immortal widower. Long white fingers, weird hairdos and diabolical laughter aside, this vampire isn't frightening. Gary Oldman is always great, even when the role is really difficult, but apart from him only Tom Waits puts down a memorable performance as Renfield. Anthony Hopkins is quite pompous as Van Helsing and both Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder are too immature for their roles. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" nonetheless remains a must-see for every self-respecting horror fan (and even every film fan in general) if it were only for the lavish sets and stunning decors, the enchanting soundtrack (Annie Lennox' ""Love Song for a Vampire"" is a classic), the sublime photography and subtle display of eroticism (including a young Monica Belluci as a bride!) and the few but notably atmospheric moments of true horror (like the sequences inside Lucy's tomb)"

","One of this movie's strengths is Francis Ford Coppola sticking closer to the source material than do the many other versions of Gothic horror's most oft told and familiar tale. Of the four principals I find Richard E. Grant as Dr. Jack, a beloved courting Lucy the most fascinating. The other three principals, Gary Oldman, Winona Ryer and Anthony Hopkins are method actors whose style works well in the silent film type Gothic horror Coppoola creates but to me never jump across the screen to grab you as communicators Other than too much darkness on screen in a darkened theater or home entertainment room this film works perfectly."
"waterman_harry","9","2","5","30 September 2014"," Gorgeous to Watch
","I adore this film. Francis Ford Coppola crafts a tragically epic romantic horror adaptation from the source material of Bram Stoker's classic vampire story Dracula. The film is primarily a melodrama that refuses to ever hold back on the special effects and sometimes over-the-top theatrics, but it all fuses together extremely well with the stripped back performances of Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder. I also enjoyed the film because whilst it appeals to a film-conscious audience, it also stays truthful to the book and does the novel justice. Dracula isn't a monster movie in the vein of 'American Werewolf in London', it is however one of the most obscurely romantic films you could want to watch. I enjoyed every minute of it."
"jzappa","7","2","5","25 January 2014"," Makes Tim Burton Look Like Aki Kaurismaki
","Francis Ford Coppola's madly elaborate Dracula rendition is set between London at the advent of a modern-ish age and Transylvania according to an explosion at the Batman: The Animated Series factory. We meet a young attorney named Jonathan Harker who is supposed to venture to Dracula's castle to arrange some kind of real estate whatever stuff. The last guy who went there ran into some snags. No big deal, though. He goes, and there begins a series of deafening and flagrant omens, none of which seem to deter or even catch the attention of young Harker en route.<br/><br/>It seems as though every stop is being pulled out on Jonathan Harker's journey to let him know that danger is near. Many find the casting of Keanu Reeves in the role laughably wrong-headed, but if you think about it, he's the only one with a blank and vapid enough stare to be believable as someone who manages to miss the most aggressively blatant signs of suspicion.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Professor Van Helsing as a guy who may not be able to save victims of wolf rape, but sure can explain the hell out of it. Now, there is a lot that transpires between the voyage to Salvador Dali's Looney Tunes night terror and the werewolf violation, but Coppola and his creative team show every brazen sign of being far more interested in parades of extravagance and ceremonious tableau than with narrative power. The movie is extraordinarily theatrical in how it favors intensification over flow.<br/><br/>The lavish use of expressionism reaches to such heights that it ends up eliciting unwanted laughter. Every set, every backdrop, every detail, foreshadowing, subtext, atmospheric flourish and mere shadow on the wall is screamed at us. It makes Tim Burton look like a Scandinavian minimalist. But all the same, it can be fun letting yourself get swept up in the energy and exhilaration of the whole go-for-broke enterprise.<br/><br/>It does, after all, salvage the title character from the creative flatness of most of his other movie interpretations, and then some. I'd argue that Werner Herzog's Nosferatu takes the cake as the more deeply affecting choice, but I mean, it didn't have wolf rape or baby-eating nymphomaniacs or Tom Waits as an insane guy. Or wolf rape. And Gary Oldman is here. And Sir Anthony Hopkins. They've never detracted from the quality of any movies either have been in as far as I can tell. But more to the point, as the movie sees it, there is a reason why the three Oscars it happened to win were for makeup, costume design and sound editing. It was also nominated for one more, and that was art direction. By now, you surely see the common thread: As a sensory experience, it's a gasser."
"MikeSmash","7","2","5","17 February 2006"," Oldman's Nosferatu is superb in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula""
","Francis Ford Coppola's horror spectacular ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" stays very close to the original true account of Vlad ""the Impaler"" with all the blood, sexuality, gore, & carnage but does not leave out the fangs. Of all the Dracula films made over the years this one was missing one key component, that being Gary Oldman. Oldman's portrayal of the Transylvanian count supersedes any other & makes this film edgier, more sensual, & much more interesting to view. Oldman does more than drink blood or morph into a hideous beast; he shows a side of himself rarely seen in that of a lover. Oldman's Dracula is vulnerable, crazed with broken heart, & the consummate tragic figure. I found Oldman's performance to be one of the best if not the best performance of the Count I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The story is simple but moves at a good pace. Many, many years earlier, Vlad Dracula is a prince who is deeply in love with his bride, Elisabeta. For pride & protection of his realm, Vlad leads the kingdom's forces against the Turks with success, which also gains him the nickname of Vlad ""the Impaler"". Unbeknownst to Dracula, a Turk spy shot an arrow into the castle with a note attached bringing false news of Vlad's death. Hopelessly distraught, Elisabeta threw herself into the river below to her death. After returning from his successful war campaign, Dracula is stunned to realize what has become of his lovely young bride. The High Priest tells Dracula that Elisabeta is damned forever for committing suicide according to religious belief. Filled with uncontrollable rage, Dracula renounces his faith, curses God, & thrusts his sword into the Holy cross which bleeds in gushes. Dracula drinks the blood & is forever transformed into what we now know as Count Dracula. Meanwhile in Carfax Abbey, England, two young lovers Mina Murphy(Winona Ryder) & Jonathan Harker make plans to marry. Before all plans are to be finalized, Harker must go on a business trip & complete a big transaction for his boss' firm. Young Jonathan Harker(Keanu Reeves) goes to Transylvania to complete a real estate deal made with mysterious Counnt Dracula(Oldman). During an evening supper, Harker mistakenly shows Dracula a photo of his beloved Mina, who eerily looks a lot like Dracula's Elisabeta. The devious Count devises a plan to keep Harker at the castle while traveling to England to seduce an unsuspecting Mina/Elisabeta. The strange Count holds the poor Harker captive in his castle indefinitely. Packed in his native earth aboard a ship, Dracula nightly feeds on crew members until the ship floats into England unmanned. Dracula infects the rats on board & holds the legions at bay to use later to release a plague on the city. Dracula then goes on the prowl for Mina & seduces longtime friend Lucy Westenra, a local wealthy young woman. As time went on, Lucy fell under the curse of Dracula with a form of anemia & strange physical symptoms. Baffled & confused, Dr. Jack Seward tries to cure Lucy to no avail. Dr. Seward, beau Lord Arthur Holmwood, & Quincy P. Morris all scramble to find answers to Lucy's condition. In desperation, Dr. Seward calls upon the expertise of his former medical professor & friend Prof. Abraham Van Helsing who arrives to help cure Lucy. Van Helsing reveals Lucy's condition as vampyrism, the curse of the foul Nosferatu. Lucy's condition worsens & results in death. Meanwhile, Mina meets the seductive Dracula & begins a strange courtship. Mina cannot understand her magnetism to the Count but still will not totally break her love for Harker. Sensing her need to go to Harker, Mina sets sail for Transylvania to find her love. Harker, who escapes Dracula's brides stumbles upon a nunnery in the mountains where he is nursed back to health. Mina reunites with Harker & the two marry. Furious by Mina's betrayal, the Count knows that Harker must be destroyed & that he must release the plague on England to further his ire. In the crypt, Van Helsing, Seward, Holmwood, & Morris discover that Lucy is the undead & must be vanquished. Holmwood sadly drives a stake through his fiancé's heart & Van Helsing decapitates her. Mina & Dracula share an intimate moment with Mina accepting the dreaded curse in order to be with him forever. Reluctantly, Dracula condemns Mina to an everlasting life of blood thirst. Van Helsing & the men intrude on the interlude with Dracula escaping. Van Helsing, knowing that Mina is now cursed, gathers the men together & sets off to Transylvania to destroy the evil Count. Dracula, using Mina's thoughts, travels to his homeland as fast as he can before Van Helsing & the others reach him before sunrise. Van Helsing finds Mina only to realize that she is in league with Dracula & must help her fight the thirst swelling within her. Also, Van Helsing must fend off Dracula's brides who are in a trance fueled by their loyalty to their master & their blood lust. Once caught up with Dracula, Van Helsing & the men fight the master vampire to the death. Dracula is mortally wounded & falls into the chapel inside the castle with Mina. The fallen Nosferatu begs the lovely Mina to end his suffering & release her from his curse. Mina grants Dracula's wish & breaks the curse within her.<br/><br/>With great costumes, terrific scenery, well done make-up work, & wonderful performances by Oldman, Ryder, & Hopkins, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula will mesmerize & enthrall you. One of the best Dracula films made to date. I give the film a 7 out of ten with a big thumbs up!!!"
"belasart","8","2","5","11 January 2006"," close but not perfect
","Bram Stoker's Dracula... Before calling it such, it should actually be faithful. While being closer to the novel than most other adaptations there are some rather large deviances from the novel that need addressing. While this version did comprise most of the characters from the novel usually missing in the others, save for Lucy's mother, and include direct dialogue and narration as well as scenes from the novel, romance should NEVER be present between Dracula and any of the women in the film. Dracula is not a romantic story. Dracula is a repulsive, hairy palmed creature with only evil intentions. He is not a seducer, he is a killer with more in common with Hannibal Lecter than Don Juan. Lugosi, Lee and Schreck had it right. I guess we can blame Langella for giving us this sad, attractive take on literature's most famous undead villain. That aside, Oldman does quite well portraying the character and has his moments of true terror. The feeding of the baby to his brides, the murder of Lucy, and his rampage following Mina's departure to marry Johnathan are among them. <br/><br/>Also, there is no connection between the literary character and the historical Dracula except in that Stoker borrowed the name. His novel, originally entitled ""The Undead"" contained a character (Dracula) named Count Wampyr until he discovered Dracula's name in a book about Transylvania well into the writing of the novel. (for more on this see David Skal's commentary on the Universal Legacy Collection DVD of Dracula)<br/><br/>This aside, the visuals and the costumes as well as the acting( save for Reeves and Ryder) make for a well told and entertaining movie. Yes, when adapting books, there are often changes made to story lines and I am not opposed to such. There should be however, some responsibility in this however in making sure that those who are not familiar with the source material aware of the differences so that should they discover the book, they are not completely shocked. I have had many a person borrow one of my copies of Dracula and complain about the lost romance they expected from seeing the ""based on the book' version of the film.Being aware of the liberties that Coppola and Co. took, the film still stays with the major points of the novel. Oldman left his mark on the character much like Lugosi and Lee before him. I would definitely rank him up there with those two brilliant actors as the three definitive portrayals of Drac. Hopkins is amazing and in my opinion brings much more to the table than Van Sloane or Cushing in his portrayal of Van Helsing. He embodies the quirkiness of the character and the intelligence often ignored in other films. He is not the cardboard cutout vampire hunter that appears in most genre films. The acting by the two lovers portrayed by by Ryder and Reeves is laughable at times and their accents are anything but British. <br/><br/>The film did win Oscars for makeup and special effects which was rightfully deserved as the costumes, set design and creature effects are outstanding. Dracula was possibly the only exception as in the book he is never seen in anything but ""clad entirely in black without a spec of colour about him anywhere"". Trivial I know, but for a scholar of the book I would at least like to see the main antagonist appear as described in his original element. The only scenes in which Dracula appears dressed as Stoker described is outside Lucy's window prior to her death and when walking the streets of London.<br/><br/>The final chase scene is what I expected and wanted aside from the final scenes with Mina consoling and beheading Dracula in his castle. He should have turned to dust...<br/><br/>I hope I have not been too negative because aside from the 1931 Tod Browning/Lugosi film and Herzog's 1979 version, this is my favorite Dracula film. I just get very annoyed when many viewers are led to believe that this film is completely accurate to the source novel. There never has been and never will be a movie that is completely accurate. This one comes closest, but not perfect. Read the book first and then watch the film. Have fun with it and enjoy the liberties taken. This is overall a solid horror film in almost all areas. It is moody, depressing at times, full of action and gory as hell. Do not let my gripes deter you, not everyone is a Dracula geek like me. There are such things. Be warned!"
"Moekat1318","10","2","5","25 September 2005"," Bram Stoker's Dracula
","This movie embraces the historical image of Dracula in all of his lure, romance, horror and seductiveness. It encompasses the mystery of the vampire; sex, seduction, horror, magic, and ruthlessness. Francis Coppola took these characters and brought them to life in this hauntingly powerful rendition of Bram Stoker's book. The settings and scenes are wonderfully glamorous and hypnotic. Each scene melts into the next. You experience the Gothic genre in its glory when Dracula and his brides tempt the souls of Mina and Lucy, which is the sub underlying theme of the movie. Starting with Mina witnessing the pillage of Lucy by Dracula, who has turned into a werewolf. The symbolism of sex, lust and weakness are rampid in this scene. Mina is confronted with the powers of Dracula, but his power overtakes her and of course, she forgets what she has seen. Mina is now ill minded, not knowing what she has thought and experienced, but knowing that she wants some part of it. <br/><br/>There are many hypnotic effects in this movie that aren't even noticed until the third or fourth time seeing it. The Count's eyes are there, watching Mina, symbolisms of death and/or sacrifice come up when you least expect it, the movements of the Count are quite eerie as well. she has the perfect<br/><br/>Winona fascinatingly takes this in and plays the part of Mina fabulously. You can look at Winona and know that this period piece will be spectacular, which it was. She embraces the part, like no other. Her and Oldman create magic, mystery and power in this movie. You come yourself, to believe, that they are lovers from a past life. <br/><br/>Winona has the best face and presence for period pieces. She says that she is a bad inconstant woman, this depicts her character perfectly. She is good, yet her intentions become bad, all evolving from Dracula's power over her. He is whimsical, alluring, sexy, mysterious, fearsome and romantic. He plays the part to T. In fact, Oldman isn't playing Dracula, Dracula is simply playing him. By far, the best Dracula the big screen has seen, other than than Nosferatu of 1922. Yet Oldman is not only Dracula, but also a human being, with emotions, feelings and a longing for his long lost Elisabeta. <br/><br/>The story line of Elisabeta being reincarnated as Mina, is quite fascinating, you don't see that too much in movies, especially a Vampire movie. Its very romantic, mysticizing and plays on the wild realm of imagination of the human mind.<br/><br/>The special effects, imagery, plot, costumes and general directing of this movie is phenomenal. Its larger than life, but not in an obnoxious Hollywood way. You feel like you really are in 19th Century England, the Karpathians, and Transylvania and experiencing the fascinating mystery of Dracula. I give this movie a 10. Coppola created a Masterpiece with this one."

","It is no surprise that this movie sells for $1 or less. It is a deliberate pornographic movie that cheapens what could have been an entertaining movie. The story line is the same as other Dracula movies. What makes this one better than others is the special effects which are well done. The actors are fairly good, except for Keanu Reeves, whose acting is dry, poor and bloodless -a pun! His London accent is rather forced and not convincing. There is some humor but it is mute because of the excessive nudity and exceedingly overdone, long-suffering, lengthy, extensive, time-consuming sensuality - do you get my point?. The quality of the ""Superbit"" DVD is very good. The video does appear to be significantly clearer than regular DVD movies. If you want a really excellent Dracula movie with great special effects, watch Van Helsing, 2004 version, which does the movie right without the filth."

"CountVladDracula","10","2","6","18 June 2011"," Best Version of Dracula
","I strongly feel that THIS is the best Dracula film ever made. Unfortunately Bram Stoker's Dracula is highly under-rated and over looked today by what I would consider contemporary snobbery resulting in a divisiveness of any film lacking in the over-saturation of obvious and unrealistic computer effects and the fashion of mocking such actors as Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>No other version of Dracula has come this close to following the original novel by Bram Stoker. This film is the most faithful adaptation of Dracula to date and it also gives depth and personality to Dracula that no previous version had before.<br/><br/>There are some changes from the original novel but it does not hinder the story but rather enhances it. In this film Dracula and Mina were in love with each other and Dracula is more or less redeemed through love, and other than that embellishment is, to date, the most faithful film adaptation of the Dracula novel by Bram Stoker. This film is beautiful and very Faustian. But don't think that romantic and humanistic redemption makes this like the sappy, sparkly vampires you see in the undeserving of mention- Twilight. Dracula, in this version of the story, can still be frightening, sinister, seductive, manipulative and intimidating and yet masterfully balanced with sympathy, compassion and romance for the character. For this reason I have to say it has the best portrayed Dracula in... well... ever."
"TensersFloatingDisk","9","2","6","10 September 2006"," Keanu Reeves makes the movie
","This is probably my favorite of all the many, many film adaptations of Stoker's novel I've seen. Despite its slightly psychedelic visuals, Coppola really captures the essential tensions of the text, and if he focuses too much on the Dracula/Mina love story, he is still closer to the action of the book than 90% of the film versions available.<br/><br/>But the real winner here is whoever did the casting for this flick. Oldman is suitably snarky as the Count, more dirty-old-man than fiend here, while Rider and Hopkins chew the scenery in most of the right places. But the gem of the bunch, and the actor who really sells me on this version as an accurate adaptation of Stoker's work, is Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves, like Jack Nicholson, is strictly a one-trick-pony, acting-wise. For Nicholson, it's the gigglingly violent manic-depressive. He's got the crazy-thang down pat, but whenever he plays any other kind of role he falls right on his butt. For Keanu Reeves, think back to his star-maker, Bill n' Ted's Excellent Adventure. What Keanu Reeves, in all his blow-dried glory, pulls off well is pure California Stoner.<br/><br/>Cast him as an action star in The Matrix and you've got crapola, cast him as a Shakespearian villain in Much Ado About Nothing, and it's laughable. But cast him as an everyman who is caught up in Things He Cannot Control, and he pulls it off neatly. Think of his signature line: ""whoah."" It's the mating cry of the laid-back schmuck, run up against something WAY too heavy for him to handle. It's why the only parts of The Matrix that work, acting-wise, are those in which Keanu is dorking around, bumbling from one chaotic nightmare to another, totally over his head. The second he tries to pull off the uber-cool hero schtick, he blows it.<br/><br/>Luckily, in Coppola's Dracula, all Reeves has to do is play his best role. Johnathan Harker is Stoker's everyman, a typical English twit, prissy, correct, and utterly devoid of imagination. The whole reason the Count can get away with his invasion of Englan is because Johnathan is too dull to conceive of really cosmic evil. Dracula gives the guy about 400 clues as to his demonic nature, and they just wash over Harker like oil over a goose. Reeves plays that up in the flick...blue flames, giant wolves, people crawling backwards down the walls, and he just goes ""whoah,"" then gets on with arranging paperwork. Pure gold.<br/><br/>When you get to Hopkins or Rider's overly-dramatic huffing and puffing, it's almost a let-down from the subtle humor of seeing Ted 'Theodore' Logan trapped in Castle Dracula. Grade: A."
"boo_4ever","10","2","6","15 December 2005"," Dracula : dead and loving this.
","For me this is simply an amazing film. Having been a big fan of the novel it was refreshing to see someone go back to basics and create a film that sticks as closely to the book as possible. In much the same way Peter Jackson nailed the look and feel of the Lord of the Rings books (even if you do have doubts about his storytelling) Coppola has, for me, nailed the mood and atmosphere of the Bram Stoker classic.<br/><br/>The story needs no elaborating on. What is worth mentioning is the stunning performance by Gary Oldman as the man himself. Bringing an element to the character seldom scene (except maybe in the Nosferatu films) you begin to almost sympathise with this evil creature. Thats quite a feat! Anthony Hopkins is one of my favourite actors and his casting as Van Helsing was inspired. What wasn't quite so clever in my opinion was the bizarre decision to cast Keanu Reeves as Harker. The guy is so wooden that two more of him should be planted if he is ever chopped down.<br/><br/>A lot of people complained that the horror took a back seat in this film. True maybe, but it still contains a lot of creepy and downright horrifying scenes. The wolf on board The Demeter, the ""rape"" scene in the garden, the Lucy scene in the tomb, the bat creature and the crucifix etc. More then a lot of other balls out horror films. Not only is it creepy it also looks incredibly lush and boasts a Gothic atmosphere not matched in many films, in part thanks to the fantastic music.<br/><br/>A must see for fans of the book and horror / Gothic fans everywhere. Its also a film so good anyone can enjoy it. Except those of course who support the notion that Keanu Reeves is a good actor."

But I've seen several Dracula films and I can honestly say that this is my personal favorite.<br/><br/>As far as production values go, this is hands down better than the rest. And it is clearly much more faithful to its source material than the others. There are many flaws, but it's still a good film. It kept me engaged despite not being a fan. Recommend."

","A weird one in all honesty I had some high expectations for this film as I'm a fan of Coppola's work but this was average at best, performances of varying quality, an odd and meandering story that's occasionally broken up by flashes of brilliant and clear Coppola work in the cinematography or some odd possessed sex scene it's a weird tale of lust, love and violence that happens to feature a vampiric creature. Not all that bad but then again not all that good, probably a Halloween season watch"
"tomasdavisd","6","1","2","9 September 2017"," Loyal story-line, excessive image
","In giving an image to a story written on a book, I suppose there's a very complex difficulty with interpretation. Everyone has a different conception of characters as described in books: we all build the image that best suits the given description by the author, using as many resources as we possess.<br/><br/>But in Coppola's film, it is just too extravagant, too excessive. If looked through the filter of Bram Stoker's novel –considering the title of the movie itself declares to be loyal to the author's name, I don't find other filters to be more accurate–, the image portrayed by Coppola is a disgrace.<br/><br/>I must say that the story-line is quite complete and does not contain unnecessary changes such as in Browning's version (1931) or in Herzog's (1979), regarding who leads the actions. What these two lack in story-line, Coppola's lacks in image (or exceeds in it and takes it off track). Characters like Jonathan Harker, Quincey Morris and Abraham Van Helsing in Coppola's version are quite well-made; while Lucy Westenra is a complete disaster."

","""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is a two-movie that succeeds in passing an extremely gloomy, Gothic and terrifying mood, with an extremely theatrical direction, the long show all vampire classic archetype, sex, seduction, blood, shadows and monsters are exposed from A linearly beautiful and unique way. The script brings us the story of Count Dracula, imprisoned for centuries in this land after renouncing Christ for the church not wanting to bury his wife, realizes that his beloved reincarnated in London, and the same part for the English capital in the Victorian era to seek your beloved. The script, although confusing at times, is beautiful, the story is adapted from the spectacular book by Bram Stoker written in I897, which yielded numerous adaptations for the film, path is directed by genius Francis Ford Coppola, one of the best. Dracula is a passionate man who uses the sins and pleasures of the flesh to control everyone around him, a distinguished man who wanders unevenly across our land in search of a reason to live, the film touches on subjects such as sexual liberation, passion, Exploration of the myths for explanations, among others .... ""The Dracula of Bram Stoker"" Technically, Coppola's work is fabulous, with an incredible art direction, even in some moments, the effects are visible and extremely dated or even bad Made, this is part of the charm of the film that brings a very theatrical appearance, it is almost as if we were watching a piece or a long horror of the 1920s, the Coppola film exudes charm, nostalgia and care, with a highlight the soundtrack , Which does not let me lie in relation to the theatrical part, it is used several times, always from the weakest tone to the climax, it is worth highlighting the incredible and frightening makeup and again, never too much, a p Arabéns the direction of art and dark and yellowish photography. We have great performances here, although Keanu Reeves is not so well, Gary Oldeman is spectacular as Dracula and Anthony Hopkins sometimes scare more than the Dracula prophetic as his antithesis, Dr. Van Helsing, is worth a salve to the beautiful Winona Ryder as Mina , The beloved of Dracula, and Sandie Frost, who has a performance that highlights her wild beauty, and convinces and frightens her transformation into a vampire. Finally, ""The Dracula of Bram Stoker"" is a sensational adaptation, even in his Rhythm and in changing some things in relation to the book - For worse - nonetheless, it is a great film, with a great direction, and the last great one Vampire movie"
"maxastree","7","1","2","18 June 2016"," High-end Vampire myth, still just about sex and blood.
","I can't help but get the feeling that critics gave Coppola the benefit of the doubt with so many curiosities in this wide release film, he was of course a much lauded director and just putting his name on the film poster was sure to get asses on seats at the local multiplex.<br/><br/>It should be noted that in the early nineties, Oliver Stone's movie the Doors, the deplorably bad Natural Born Killers and of course Bram Stoker's Dracula were all completely overblown in their production design and editing - as if these talented filmmakers had given in to the misguided idea that smothering the narrative in distracting effects and post production tricks would appeal to audiences, rather than confuse them.<br/><br/>Dracula is actually a pretty good example of the genre (if ""totally overproduced early nineties movie"" is a genre) in that many of Eiko Ishioka's costume designs are strikingly bizarre or beautiful, the sets are stuffed with opulent Gothic and Victorian decoration, and of course Anthony Hopkins is great as Dr Van Helsing, a remorseless dutch Dr and metaphysician of his time, trying to rid the world of the Nosferatu, played by Gary Oldman.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film's ""ambitious set design"" is that it's so often distracting. Some viewers could be wondering why in the films preamble, 15th century Romanian warriors are wearing bizarre red suits of plastic and leather that look nothing remotely suited to the era. The period costumes actually resemble science fiction items from Mario Bava's 1965 film Planet of the Vampires. The heavy religious imagery and chiaroscuro lighting add an impressive renaissance flavor also, but my main complaint is that the ingredients don't really create a convincing narrative whole. The very set-bound and design-oriented nature of the film is impressive, but not convincing.<br/><br/>Coppola's intent of course is that it's all visual prosody, i.e: that the film's endless special effects and overstated design are riffing on themes of blood letting, mortality, repression, lust, venereal disease and the corrupt, horrible evil of some ancient ruling class. Good idea, but its all too flashy to truly sink in.<br/><br/>The special effects are frequently excellent, as Count Dracula in this picture appears as a person of different physical ages, he casts no reflection, he is a familiar of wolves and bats, and can turn into wolves and bats, also he appears sometimes as a hideous writhing humanoid bat of about seven feet in height. Sometimes he appears as a sickly green fog. <br/><br/>You get the idea: in almost EVERY shot in this film, there are visual effects, but also Coppola gives into the temptation to add wacky editing techniques including bits of sped up and slowed down film to create a very opulent period picture that frequently looks like a music video. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the film is about two things: lavish production design and sleazy, erotic encounters showing vampire mistresses or Victorian ladies on the verge of orgasm with vampires. It could be a ""comment"" on Victorian sexuality, but more likely its just sleaze for the sake of sleaze, titillating the audience in much the same way that cheap teen comedies of the era liked to depict tall, naked legs or plunging breast shots on the VHS cover. <br/><br/>My last issue, as so many raised in 1992 is that Keanu Reeves isn't exactly suited for Gothic material. His previous two hits, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Point Break were teen-oriented summertime movies, and while he has on screen sex appeal, his character Jonathan Harker would have benefited greatly from a quality actor, like say Daniel Day Lewis, who could make a realistic effort of the required accent for the part and most importantly his emotive skill would be the focus area of a given scene, two things that Reeves just isn't really capable of."
"Maladjusted_1","6","1","2","12 March 2016"," An imaginative but heavily flawed adaptation of the Stoker classic.
","At some point or other, everyone watches a 'Dracula' film. Some people will remember Bela Lugosi's seminal portrayal of the vampire; others will think of Christopher Lee and the Hammer horrors. Fourteen years ago, the legend behind 'The Godfather' brought us a different, more imaginative type of adaptation. Whilst Coppola doesn't work with Stoker's work as well as Puzo's, his film holds several significant merits. Before I talk about the performances, I must commend the crew members responsible for the make-up, costumes and special effects, as 'Dracula' is a near-unparalleled visual experience. Too often, the people tasked with refining a film, enlivening its characters and placing them within a vibrant environment are forgotten by audiences. The scale of the 'Dracula' crew's feats has secured them a place in the vivid memory of film fans, and should continue to do so for a long time. Equally memorable are some of the performances. Gary Oldman is one of the greatest working actors, and his excellence as Bram Stoker's legendary villain makes Coppola's 'Dracula' worthwhile. The then-recent star of 'The Silence of the Lambs', Anthony Hopkins, delivers a similarly enjoyable performance, although the visual and written restrictions placed on character of Dr Van Helsing prevents him from ever wresting the spotlight from Oldman. Another decent performance is provided by Winona Ryder. I wouldn't place her in the same category as Oldman and Hopkins, but she manages to play a fairly boring part with conviction. Now for the elephant in the room You could fill the pages of 'War and Peace' with a compilation of criticisms regarding the casting of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker, and so I won't go into detail on this issue. It should certainly be acknowledged, though, as it has to be one of the worst casting choices to ever take place in a major Hollywood film. The atmosphere developed by Oldman's outstanding acting is awfully diminished in scenes involving Harker, and so Coppola's 'Dracula' never becomes the horror it has the potential to be. The film, probably for this reason, feels longer than its runtime of 128 minutes; at least half an hour longer. It's worth enduring, however, as the inevitable climactic scene does not disappoint. Overall, Coppola's 'Dracula' bears some significant flaws, but accomplishments in visual style and dramatic performance make it a rather enjoyable film."
"utgard14","7","1","2","29 August 2015"," ""The blood is the life... and it shall be mine.""
","Francis Ford Coppola's sumptuous retelling of a story that, frankly, has been told to death. It's one of the more fresh and inventive versions of the Dracula story that has ever been filmed. That isn't to say it's without flaws (the limited acting abilities of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, for example) but it has a lot going for it that few cinematic Draculas do. The script reworks and expands upon Stoker's tale in some brilliant ways, adding depth to the Dracula character that is largely missing from the novel. Gary Oldman's performance is wonderfully theatrical without going too far into camp territory. It's one of Coppola's best post-70s films. Possibly the best, in my opinion. Of course it doesn't match up to his classics from that decade but it is far more memorable than most of his efforts since. The visuals in this movie are simply stunning. The colors, the sets, the costumes, the effects, the editing are all remarkable. Wojciech Kilar's evocative score is deserving of more praise. <br/><br/>This isn't the scariest Dracula movie ever made but it is one of the more interesting. It may wallow in its excesses at times and it is probably a tad longer than necessary, but it's a gorgeous film with so much going on in every scene that I never felt bored or uninvolved. Lugosi and Lee will always be paramount in my book but this Dracula has earned a special place in my heart over the years. It's a movie I revisit from time to time and I am always finding more things about it to enjoy."
"deideiblueeyez","8","1","2","4 May 2014"," Wonderful adaption of the book
","I must admit that I didn't finish Dracula when I read it back in 6th grade. I got to the part about the zoo and then completely conked out and never picked it up again, so I'm glad this film followed the source material to the virtual T.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman shows his trademark chameleon ability to inhabit whatever role he is given and his accent was overall spot-on as well. Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was an odd choice but he played the part of the eccentric monster hunter/physician surprisingly well, though his German (?) accent seemed to slip just a bit at times, especially during his initial appearance. My standards for Keanu Reeves are always low because honestly I feel he is a very wooden actor, and he proves this again in this movie, but everyone else picks up the slack with their phenomenal acting.<br/><br/>The cinematography was clever in its fade outs and overlapping of images to convey simultaneous happenings, though sometimes it felt a little overdone. The outfits were well-researched and fit their respective characters perfectly in terms of their personalities, backgrounds, and of course for historical accuracy's sake. <br/><br/>The ending felt the tiniest bit...cheesy but that's neither here nor there when it came to the journey. Overall I'd give this film a watch since it makes an already entertaining Gothic horror story something entertaining and beautiful to watch."
"pundit-1","6","1","2","22 April 2014"," Another film that failed to be better than it was.
","This movie is one of those films that could have been better than it was. Instead I felt the movie was ruined with too many special effects, which I think took away whatever atmosphere or Gothic creepy ambiance it could have had. Also overdone with the sex scenes which didn't help. Instead of a really good original horror movie what this turned out to be is just another typically bland Hollywood blockbuster. Full of flash and erotica but with little substance, that seems so typical of the usual Hollywood productions.<br/><br/>Also it has been advertised as being based accurately on Bram Stoker's novel which isn't completely true. In original story there was no romance between Mina Harker and Dracula. Also there was never any mention of Mina being a reincarnation of Dracula's dead wife. That and his wife committing suicide in the beginning of the film was simply added into the movie to turn this into a romance story.<br/><br/>It's one of those films that I found disappointing or a real letdown. I couldn't help but feel that it could have been way better than it was."
"jackasstrange","6","1","2","10 January 2014"," Incoherent, disappointing effort
","Dracula clearly had potential to be a great film. Excellent source material, an excellent director and a excellent cast. Which more is needed, right? Unfortunately, nothing works. The adaptation of the classic book to the film is mediocre at best. <br/><br/>The story came in pieces, and is absolutely incoherent further first viewing, that is the most important. It improves upon a second viewing, mostly because you can pay attention to other aspects of the film which is impossible to do with the consistent cuts and scenes rising out of nowhere in first viewing.<br/><br/>Still, there are totally nonsense scenes (the cemetery scene is a prime example) in the film that are there for whatever reason. The film captures one of the most important aspects in the book, that is the ambient, the erotic and romantic atmosphere contrasting with the horrific monsters and the dark, Gothic tone given by the excellent art direction. The visual effects tough, are outdated and horrible, it is even awful at times.<br/><br/>The acting, apart for the good performance by Gary Oldman, is average and even mediocre at times. Winona Ryder is pretty disappointing in it. Keanu Reeves it's in one of his best performances here, and still that's not saying too much. Anthony Hopkins is meh, neither good nor bad, just mildly convincing. The first sequence, explaining how 'Draculia' turns in 'Dracula' has one of the worst acting efforts I've seen in a long while. But despite that, it's not as big as a problem as the editing is. Frankly, it's a disappointing film mostly because it had everything to be a great and big one. It seems that everything was done badly and in the laziest and campy way possible. A shame. One of Coppola's weakest efforts. 5.7/10"

","I think the biggest crime of Bram Stoker's Dracula...is the fact that it is called BRAM STOKER'S Dracula! Seriously, Coppola took such extreme liberties with the original text of the novel, that he shows some nerve by implying that his film is so definitive a treatment. In reality, this is the director's most schizophrenic masterpiece, astonishingly artful in some areas, distractingly clumsy in others. I mean, Keanu Reeves? He looks so adrift and horribly out-performed by everyone else in the cast. I like Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman's performances though. There have been MUCH better Dracula movies (Nosferatu, anyone?) and far more charismatic interpretations (Bela Lugosi, but for what it's worth, ""Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula"" is a worthy addition to the long and storied mythology of Bram Stoker's legendary idol."

"Wuchakk","8","1","2","31 March 2011"," Dracula: A Love Story
","Released at Christmas time 1992, Francis Ford Coppola's version of the oft-filmed tale was fairly successful at the US box office, costing $40 million and bringing in $82.5 million; it earned an additional $133 million worldwide for a total of $216 million. These are good figures for back then.<br/><br/>POSITIVES:<br/><br/>* This is easily the most stylistic and visually opulent film version of Dracula.<br/><br/>* The first 88 minutes, up to Lucy's vampiric resurrection, are great.<br/><br/>* I've always thought one of the best parts of the original novel was the beginning where Jonathan Harker goes to Transylvania to visit the Count at his castle and the ensuing horror. This entire sequence is done very well in Coppola's version.<br/><br/>* Harker's run-in with Drac's three brides is outstanding. Monica Belucci appears as one of the three ravishing-yet-diabolic brides; she was one of the most beautiful women in the world at the time.<br/><br/>* Another great scene is the surreal sequence in Lucy's lavish gardens where she's seduced by Dracula in man-wolf form, spied by Mina.<br/><br/>* Lucy's vampiric resurrection in the tomb is well done & creepy.<br/><br/>* Drac's supernatural aspects are played up here more than any other version of the tale (up to that point); he appears as an old man, a younger man, a wolf, a man-wolf, a bunch of rats, a green mist, and a man-bat creature.<br/><br/>* Sadie Frost puts her whole heart into the role of Lucy and is excellent. Winona Ryder is also effective as the meek Mina.<br/><br/>* Not to mention Anthony Hopkins makes the best Van Helsing with his determined, hardy spunk.<br/><br/>* The score by Wojciech Kilar is fitting and memorable.<br/><br/>* Writer James V. Hart gets creative and adds an interesting twist to the done-to-death yarn. I'm referring to Drac's love for Mina, who's evidently his wife reincarnated. This new element helps keep the story interesting for those who may be bored with the oft-told tale.<br/><br/>* The ultimate message of the film is great: Love conquers all and the light of God's presence brings redemption to those whose hearts still blip with a glimmer of hope, faith and love, no matter how mired in darkness. Freedom & forgiveness are there IF you want it.<br/><br/>NEGATIVES:<br/><br/>* Despite the title, this is not a faithful version of Stoker's book. The difference is that the Dracula in Coppola & Hart's version is not a paragon of unadulterated evil, but rather a sympathetic vampire with a serious case of love-sickness. Needless to say, this takes the bite out of the Count's wicked exploits as it's nigh impossible for the viewer to be horrified by a character with whom s/he sympathizes.<br/><br/>* Gary Oldman, who plays Dracula, does a great John Lennon impersonation.<br/><br/>* The film is entertaining and successfully creates a horror atmosphere, but I never found it scary like, say, the 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" (This isn't really a negative to me since I don't really WANT to be scared; I want to sleep at night!)<br/><br/>* The fact that Dracula appears in so many supernatural forms can be confusing on one's initial viewing, unless of course you're well-versed with the book; consequently, the viewer may have a hard time comprehending or even identifying the title character (Is he an old man, a younger man, a wolf, a bunch of rats, a werewolf, a mist, a man-bat or what?!).<br/><br/>* The last act, which comprises the final 33 minutes (not including credits), loses the captivating appeal of the first 88 minutes. Up to this point Coppola & Hart obviously took their time with the characters and their story and it worked. The final act, however, seems like they rushed to tie everything up by the 2-hour mark. Don't get me wrong, the last act isn't bad and it has some quality action, but it's just not as good as the first two acts; it's a little confusing and the film suffers for it.<br/><br/>* The final act contains two love scenes between Drac & Mina that are difficult to watch. I just get sick to my stomach viewing these sequences where Mina gets intimate with this nasty fiend (not sexually), particularly the scene in the chapel where Drac looks like a hellish man-bat. But, then again, I like the message: Genuine love & loyalty transcend personal failings and distasteful aspects, like a wife who still loves her husband even though she sees him floss his green teeth and washes his soiled underwear (lol).<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Coppola & Hart's version is colorfully lavish and adds an interesting love story to Stoker's tale with potent spiritual significance. This will, of course, turn-off purists who prefer the totally malevolent king of vampires of the original novel, which is what disenchanted me the first time I saw it, but who can blame Coppola & Hart for wanting to try something new with the well-worn yarn? Despite a fairly weak final act and a cobbled-together vibe, they largely succeed.<br/><br/>Although losing points for the negatives listed above, I have to admit that this is probably my favorite version of the tale, which says a lot.<br/><br/>Amazingly, the film was shot completely on studio sets, but doesn't seem like it. It runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+/A-"

","From the long-winded title (the film was originally released as 'Bram Stoker's Dracula') you might suspect Francis Ford Coppola of not wanting credit for this flawed but entertaining adaptation of the classic horror story, and he may well have a point. The umpteenth remake foregrounds all the repressed Victorian sexuality of the vampire legend with sometimes subtle, sometimes sloppy Gothic imagery and effects, but the details are by now too familiar to raise any serious goose bumps. At any rate the colorful bloodlust and overheated ambiance is diminished by all the amateur theatrics, with playacting English accents ranging from the merely embarrassing (Winona Ryder) to the downright hopeless (Keanu Reeves). A notable exception to the unfortunate casting (not overlooking an equally over-the-top cameo by Tom Waits as the spider-eating Renfield) is Anthony Hopkins deranged interpretation of fearless vampire slayer Professor von Helsing. His performance completely overshadows Gary Oldman in the title role, who shows none of the evil charisma expected from an immortal, bloodsucking aristocrat."

The story, though belongs to horror genre, has lots of delicate descriptions of beautiful nature and the also full of gratitude and admiration of behavior of the main characters for example Van Helsing and Mina and three lovers of Lucy, but to my astonishment, the story narrated in the movie, has very erotic theme, the virtuous Mina who is even blushed of consoling the three lovers (Arthur, Quincey and John), is ready to make love even with Van Helsing!!! By the way, the story of old love between Dracula and Mina is quite artificial and does not have any roots in the Stoker's novel.

So where did it all go wrong? Well, tonally and thematically the film is a mess. It feels like various different movies spliced together. It looks beautiful though. Coppola and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus creating a stunning look, draped in Gothic beauty, and Coppola seemingly knows his film history, borrowing liberally from vampire films of the past, particularly Nosferatu. The acting is a mixed bag. Keanu Reeves is uncomfortably out of his depth, struggling constantly with an English accent, while Anthony Hopkins hams it up as Van Helsing. The bright spark though is Gary Oldman, completely immersing himself in the role, even when buried under prosthetics and wigs. He makes Dracula a horrific character, while also finding added layers of pathos and sadness. It's a shame the film is such a mess though."
"kriitikko","5","1","2","8 July 2008"," Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, not Bram Stoker's.
","Francis Ford Coppola's film version of Bram Stoker's classic novel is the first Dracula film I ever saw. I don't remember much of my first reactions to it, but it did leave an impression, for since I have been a dedicated fan of Dracula. For a long time I remember thinking very highly of this film, until I started watching other Dracula film adaptations and, more importantly, read the book. Afterwards the film has proved to be quite a disappointing in many aspects, even when I would never really say it's a bad film.<br/><br/>In the 15'Th century Transylvania, Prince Vlad Draculea (Gary Oldman) looses his beloved wife because of a treachery. Feeling that he is unjustly rewarded after all of his good deeds, he curses God and sells his soul to devil, thus becoming a powerful vampire. Four centuries later he goes by the name of Count Dracula and prepares to take over the entire world, starting in London. However, there he meets Mina (Winona Ryder) who is an exact image of his long lost wife. While Dracula aims to seduce Mina to his side, his other actions don't go unnoticed by Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), and soon vampire hunters are after the Count.<br/><br/>The film goes under the title of ""BRAM STOKER'S Dracula"" and Coppola advertised it as the most faithful film version of the book. True, there are many things in this movie from the book that other versions have left out, for example for the first time every major character from the book appears here. However, calling it the most faithful version is a downright lie. That title goes to the 1977 BBC film, starring Louis Jourdan. Coppola could have made this one of the most faithful versions, if he had cut the whole subplot of Dracula and Mina's romance out of the movie (the idea of Dracula looking for a lost love is not even original but was already used in 1973 TV film by Dan Curtis). The most infuriating thing here especially is how out of character Dracula sometimes appears. There is a scene in the film, where Dracula is ready to make Mina a vampire but tries to resist, saying that he loves her too much to condemn her. I found this to bee amazing rubbish. If Dracula would truly find a woman he'd want he would let nothing get to his way. Dracula is both obsessive and possessive. This version makes it seem like he would prefer to have walks with her in a pretty park. Mr. Coppola, you got your Phantom of the Opera and Dracula mixed up.<br/><br/>However, as said this is not a bad movie either. Visually the movie is rich and amazing to watch. Garret Lewis' sets are properly Victorian like and Michael Ballhaus' cinematography is flying and imaginative. One of the most memorable aspects of the film is Wojciech Kilar's beautiful music. Although little influenced by John William's 1979 score, Kilar's music can change from powerful apocalyptic atmosphere to a tender, loving sweetness.<br/><br/>From the actor department the film has some very good choices and some very, surprisingly, bad ones. Gary Oldman, whenever he is not a sweet ""I won't bite"" mood, does a good job with Dracula. He manages to capture the powerful side of Dracula, the war lord in him still yearning for his days of power and glory. However, I am disappointed that he was made to wear weird wolf-like and bat-like suits in the film. I think an actor like Gary Oldman could have been scary without them. Winona Ryder does a decent job as a very Snow-white like Mina. In minor roles both Richard E. Grant and Cary Elwes pass as the young suitors and Tom Waits has a delightful little role as the insane Renfield. Keanu Reeves is the weakest link here as Mina's fiancé Jonathan, completely unable to bring any life to his role. Anthony Hopkins turns out to be a surprising disappointment as Van Helsing. He plays his role so theatrically over the board, making Van Helsing appear as little insane, that I personally would feel safer with Dracula than him.<br/><br/>Although I really wouldn't want to say anything bad about this film I have to admit that it has many flaws also. The greatest one is Coppola's trap of making viewer think he'll see a faithful movie version of Bram Stoker's book and is given something else. Still, a decent movie that passes through couple times to be watched."

","This movie is fine, seriously, if you like Dracula and have never read the book (nor do you ever intend to) and are completely ignorant about Vlad the Impaler, go ahead, you'll love it.<br/><br/>I, unfortunately, do not fit into either of those categories.<br/><br/>Dracula, in the book, is a *really* evil guy, there is no love between him and *anyone*. He's not mourning his lost love (one might say he's incapable of it). He's not going to London in search of anything. He's a sociopathic monster.<br/><br/>Instead, we get a lonely guy who just wants a hug and who doesn't want to hurt people.<br/><br/>No characters are spared.<br/><br/>Both Lucy and Mina are turned from virtuous women into, and I'll try to put it delicately, 'women of the night', ready to spread their legs for anyone who happens by so we get a few boob shots.<br/><br/>All of the men are turned into idiots at best, vindictive psychopaths bent on destroying Dracula for no particular reason at worst.<br/><br/>The part that gets me, though, is the connection to Vlad the Impaler. I, for everything I've read, all of the research I've done, can't fathom feeling sorry for him. It is written that Bram Stoker himself chose Dracula because he was (at the time) fairly obscure, and anyone who *had* heard of him would think ""I say! That's nasty!"" Case in point, his most pronounced victory over the Turks was accomplished by seriously freaking them out. He stopped a smaller force and took them, and anyone else he could find, put stakes up their bums (and out their mouths) and made a little forest. As I mentioned, the Turks were *seriously* freaked out.<br/><br/>As for his love story, he killed one of his wives, according to legend, by cutting her from snooch to neck to prove she was pregnant with another man's baby. No word on the results. He remarried.<br/><br/>That's not much with the movie though.<br/><br/>I feel like my largest problem is the creative licenses taken, and the places where it *isn't* taken. OK, I can't avoid spoilers anymore.<br/><br/>Every single sex scene in the movie, especially where Dracula is a big werewolf, I could do without. John Harker getting a BJ from the concubines, please.<br/><br/>Dracula had, what they call in some circles, his Rape the Dog moment. It was taken straight from the book. It fit with Bram Stoker's version, not with Coppola's: he goes out, finds a random baby, and brings it back to feed his concubines. Maybe he doesn't finish it all by himself, but make no mistake. Dracula starts off by eating a baby.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when Dracula is climbing down the wall, yes, they say in the book 'he climbed down like a lizard' and that is exactly what Gary Oldman did. I would have, I don't know, added some wind. He just looked like someone crawling on a flat surface. Just because *he* isn't affected by gravity, doesn't mean his massive cloak is the same.<br/><br/>What was the deal with the mice on the ceiling? Are they vampire mice? Are they trying to say that the wall climbing wasn't a vampire thing, but because of the liquid John Harker found? This movie felt more like Anne Rice's Dracula. Maybe they're sociopathic killers of the night, but they just want to be loved. Humans are bad for wanting to kill them.<br/><br/>If, however, you are halfway sane and have no plans of ever reading either the original book or anything about Vlad the Impaler, you'll love it. You even get a few boob shots.<br/><br/>By the way, if you've seen the baby and *do* want to read the book, by all means, go ahead. The two have very little to do with one another."
"gavin6942","9","1","2","18 June 2008"," Beautiful, Romantic Interpretation of Bram Stoker
","Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) is an Englishman and a real estate agent who has procured some land for his client, Count Dracula of Romania (Gary Oldman). But the Count (who, as the audience knows, is really a bloodthirsty vampire) has his sights set not only on land but also Harker's fiancé, Mina (Winona Ryder). Rounding out the cast is Anthony Hopkins as VanHelsing, Cary Elwes as a suitor to Mina's friend Lucy, and Tom Waits as the psychotic Renfield.<br/><br/>This is an astoundingly amazing film. It's told in such an epic fashion, and I really wish they had made the movie longer. Hopkins as VanHelsing is as good or better than any Peter Cushing interpretation (this VanHelsing is darkly comic, which works great). More of the story could have been told or secondary characters may have been developed more. The Texan, for example, seems incredibly out of place and could have used some background... and Hopkins doesn't enter the movie until the second half.<br/><br/>The deviation from the book is slight in some places and greater in others. For the most part, the diary entries were kept to move the plot along, which pleases me greatly. But there also seems to be an unusual obsession with making this a romance, which is somewhat unnecessary. There are romantic elements in the book (and my high school English teacher always stressed the symbolism of penetration in ""Dracula""), but it goes to a new level in the film that seems designed to draw in a wider audience. Whether this is good or bad, I'm not entirely sure.<br/><br/>The special effects deserve praise. Compared to today (2008), I found the effects here far more convincing. The shadows that have their own minds, the count's transformations (powered by Oldman, the best actor in Hollywood today) and more. Other films of the era (most notably ""Jurassic Park"") also pushed the limits of effects for the time, but ""Dracula"" shouldn't be under-rated in this department. Many today could take a lesson from this playbook.<br/><br/>I made a bigger deal of the cast in my plot summary than usual, but this is with good reason: the casting of this film is highly peculiar, and even more peculiar is how successful the combination of actors comes across. Keanu Reeves is not known as a great leading man, still fresh from ""Bill and Ted"", but he does a decent enough job here. Winona Ryder is also somewhat of a lightweight, but pulls it off. But, countering this, Hopkins is amazing (as already noted), Oldman is the most perfect character actor for villains... and who would have thought to consider Tom Waits as a madman? It seems so obvious once you think about it.<br/><br/>I watched this film on a DVD I purchased from a chain store for five bucks. It was worth this much and more. I am not aware if a special edition exists, but with this film's great cast, awesome plots, awards won and wide appeal, a good edition should. There is very little that could make the actual film better, but a solid audio commentary, 20-year retrospective and any deleted scenes would really provide the consumer with a worthwhile package."

Kubrick is fair-play arguing that's a good movie, since Kubrick was intelligent).<br/><br/>Anyway, from all Coppola's movies, this one is only that deserves 8/10 (and believe me, I'm really generous and nice this time) : I read the book, I've seen almost all vampire's movies and my veredict is clear, Coppola's is the closest (with Nosferatu by Murnau) to Stoker's idea.<br/><br/>By the way, making this movie a nice work : all the actors were very good (even Keanu Reeves, who does a quite acceptable acting), Sir Anthony (Van Helsing) and Master Gary (Vlad Dracul) are trustful trademarks for an excellent movie (well... if you exclude Hannibal and Air Force One, but that wasn't their fault)...<br/><br/>Not to forget, recreating Victorian England, the Mideval Rumania and all the rest of the goodies, this is an interesting movie.<br/><br/>Thanks and don't let me be misunderstood !"

","The dark tale about the legendary vampire is brought to a vivid light by the brilliance of Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola in this dark fantasy horror.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman (Air Force one) portrays Count Dracula beautifully, being both malicious but sensitive at frequent occasions as he travels to London and believes to have found a woman, who is a reincarnation of a lady he once loved many many years ago.<br/><br/>This adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel is dark and powerful, with a strong focus upon the ideology of evil, with Oldman doing superbly to portray the Count's evilness against Anthony Hopkins' (Silence of the Lambs) goodness as Van Helsing.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) is a bit of a let down as Jonathan Harker with his character not being in the film not nearly enough.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder (Little Women) is excellent as Mina Murray, Count's love interest.

"drownnnsoda","9","1","2","6 October 2007"," Sensual, Artistic, And Horrific Telling Of Stoker's Classic Tale.
","""Dracula"" begins with Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), who makes a visit to a Transylvanian castle that homes Count Dracula (Gary Oldman). Count Dracula, who is a blood-drinking king of the undead, takes a liking to Harker's fiancé, Mina Murray (Winona Ryder), who is living back in London. But when Dracula makes his way to the foreign land, many strange things begin to happen. Lucy (Sadie Frost), Mina's childhood friend, is struck ill after having a horrific incident that left her with two puncture wounds on the neck. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) comes to investigate the strange happenings, and comes to the realization that Dracula is near... and will stop at nothing to pursue Mina, because they have some sort of connection - one from beyond the grave.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"", based on the all-time classic novel by Bram Stoker, is an enthralling and consistently eerie film with many artistic qualities. One of the main things about this film that stands out is its stunning cinematography and its Gothic and grotesque imagery. Coppola has taken the classic horror tale and brought it to the screen as pure eye candy- the entire movie is really a visual treat. Surreal settings, vivid use of colors, and violent imagery blended with sexuality all make it a bizarre and fantastic experience. To my surprise, even, it was a fairly bloody rendition of the tale, but not too over the top. There are some very frightening scenes and a handful that will stick in your mind. Also notable is the special effects work that was done on the movie. The Dracula character goes through many different transformations throughout the story, from an old-aged man, to a young one, and to a vampire beast. Great work in the special effects there, I was surprised at how well done it was. <br/><br/>But, we really have to give credit to Oldman himself, who likely out-does Bela Lugosi's Dracula, with his seductive, frightening performance. He has been praised by many for his performance here, and deservedly so. Winona Ryder, although I couldn't picture her in the role at first, plays Mina excellently. The supporting cast includes Anthony Hopkins (right after his award-winning performance in ""The Silence of the Lambs"") as Van Helsing, Keanu Reeves as Jonathan (who wasn't great here, passable, but I've never thought he was an impressive actor to begin with), Cary Elwes as Lord Arthur, and Sadie Frost as Lucy. The cast was overall very strong, and it was neat to see some of the actors playing characters from the Victorian era. I admired this movie as well for staying fairly true to Stoker's novel, everything was adapted well.<br/><br/>Overall, Coppola's ""Dracula"" is probably the best film telling out there. If there's a better one, I sure haven't seen it. If you know the story well, you won't be displeased. The cinematography and visuals are enough to deem this film as a must-see at least once, but all things considered, this is an artistic, frightening, fantastic movie. Excellent from beginning to end, and probably the best vampire film that I've ever seen. Highly recommended based on its excellent script and truly stunning visuals, you won't be disappointed. 9/10."
"srhjnlynch","5","1","2","7 May 2007"," Bram Stoker's? Says who?
","I recently read the novel for the first time and was very impressed with its freshness and modernity, especially the intelligence and strength of Mina and her importance to the group. I remembered FFC's film quite well and decided to watch it again to compare... yes Gary Oldman acts his socks off but what's with the Mina/Elizabeta plot? It completely detracts from Mina's status as a strong intelligent woman and makes a mockery of her feelings for Harker. Harker is portrayed to a weak and feeble character, exemplified by the woeful casting of Keanu Reeves (doing surf Victorian it seems) and the whole tale becomes frankly ludicrous. Why would they deliver a willing vampire and lover of Dracula such as Mina back to the Count? They know nothing of her 'reincarnation'. They'd just put a stake through her heart and be done with it. It seems maybe Oldman got a hold of the original script and demanded his part be made bigger, so they swapped Dracula's and Harker's roles. Film wise, the constant cross fades are pretty annoying (for example, yeah, FFC, you don't need to show me Ryder's face in the painting in Transylvania - I got it) throughout the film and frankly I got bored as it's just too long. As for the end - well, without spoiling it, what then? Another proof that the Dracula/Mina love story is just silly. It's like FFC just stopped filming 'Quick! Titles!' It's a shame - there was obviously a lot of effort put into this film but overall I think most of those involved either didn't read the book or have never been to England. So much of it could have worked if they'd have stuck to the original story. What's next - Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights but Heathcliffe and Catherine spend the whole time having sensual sex and get married in the end?! A wasted opportunity."
"ozthegreatat42330","7","1","2","27 April 2007"," This Dracula sucked.
","I give you that the look of the film was good, the acting was adequate. The casting was terrible and done for the wrong reasons. And why must they constantly rewrite Stoker when they claim to be following his original work. My biggest complaint was Anthony Hopkins. Van Helsing is, according to Stoker, a well known and well admired physician and occultist, but the script, or Hopkins (a fine actor who I greatly admire) turned him into a raving eccentric and a rude one at that. Van Helsing, an old fashion European Gentleman would never had been as rude to Mina, as he was at the dinner after Lucy's staking. Keannu Reeves did not belong in the film either. He was totally unbelievable. And the special effects, which I often appreciate in and of themselves, actually detracted from the story. Although there was one, of Dracula gesturing with a hand and a cross bursting into flame, that I was able to incorporate into a live stage version of Dracula several years later. The film wasn't really all that bad, but I did cringe a lot when I watched it. Gary Oldman did an excellent job though, as very sympathetic Dracula, which in return made his character all that much more menacing. Still, sorry, not my favorite version."

"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","1","2","17 November 2006"," 'Gary Oldman' is really a group of actors performing under that name
","This is Coppola's inexcusably long but entertaining incarnation of Stoker's timeless 'Dracula'. Seeing it for the first time, I was sort of stunned by the theatricality of the the whole spectacle. It regrettably seems as though the heaviest weapon in the director's arsenal is style  and it shows in the large scale of sets, among other things.<br/><br/>The story should be well-known and here it opens faithfully in an intense prologue, setting the grisly and dramatic tone for the film. In the fiery midst of 15th century battle, Romanian warrior Vlad the Impaler denounces Christianity when his wife kills herself because she believes him dead  and is banished as a vampire as revenge by God. Cut to 1897 Victorian Europe, bursting with costumes, period tints and fine wine and the soon-to-be-married couple Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) and Mina Murray (Winona Ryder). Dracula now lives immortally in his dusty old castle where he imprisons Jonathan in the dungeons with his vampire brides... all to reconnect with Mina who is a reincarnation of his wife.<br/><br/>The above plot outline is by nature supernatural and over-the-top and Coppola rigorously subscribes to loyalty in translating the novel. It is therefore a highly exaggerated extravaganza, no hyperbole. With vivid special effects, lavish Gothic sets, melodramatic mannerisms, swooning maidens and evil-laughing villains, 'Dracula' takes and shakes you with flair and makes no pretense about it. This approach naturally renders whatever comedy emerges from the melodrama as camp as a row of tents, but we accept it because it is easy to get sucked in the sheer fun of the spectacle. All the while Coppola nods politely to classic horror with bloody gore that splatters in orgies.<br/><br/>Performances arguably take a backseat to the theatricality of the set. Yet, there are fine actors to be found when weeding through the lesser 'performances'. Speaking of which, let me debunk the myth that Keanu Reeves is awful as Jonathan Harker. Yes, his casting is plain puzzling  as is his permanent expression  but between all the ludicrous impersonations of his accents throughout the years (""dude""), I was almost positively surprised. The resident Hollywood deer-eyed damsel in distress Winona Ryder aptly chips in as Dracula's doomed maiden, who has now been reborn. It is no easy character to portray realistically but Ryder makes Mina/Elisabetha work fairly well.<br/><br/>But Dracula  character and film  belongs to Gary Oldman. Is there no character this man cannot believably inhabit? I think not. Here Oldman's chameleon-like charisma shapes and molds itself to form a perfectly charismatic and sometimes bruised Vlad/Dracula. I'm slowly reaching the conclusion that 'Gary Oldman' is really a group of actors performing under that name. It is also thanks to him that we are offered a few genuinely emotionally poignant moments, such as embracing Winona or the tragic and compelling fate of his past life, through the flashback device (which was very good in general).<br/><br/>Conclusion? Coppola has not created anything remarkable here; he ticks off a few too many clichés from the horror formula, even rehashing Dracula riffs; the acting is occasionally hammy; the whole thing often tips over into showy; it is too long  but weed through those shortcomings and Dracula is an epic horror adventure, interweaving love, lust, betrayal, passion, sin, jealousy, blood and eroticism in drafty old castles. <br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","Francis Ford Coppola adapts the book Dracula for the modern audience. The film is beautiful to look at in places, the costumes worn by Dracula and the women in the film are wonderful. The set pieces are also worth applauding, referencing the Dracula films that came before it, Coppola does a fine job of creating a victorian england and a wild pre-communist, superstition ruled Transylvannia. Gary Oldman is one of the finest character actors working in movies these days and seems to work far too infrequently ,even in trash ( Lost in Space) he is a standout. In this movie he does a good job of portraying the tortured, cursed count in all his incarnations. The Counts various manifestations are the best movie effects can offer, from a dessicated Count, to a huge bat like creature to a werewolf all are frighteningly realistic. Anthony Hopkins is an excellent actor and brings his usual intelligent gravitas to the role of Van Helsing. Keanuu Reeves however, ruins most of the movie for me, he is a terrible actor, after some twenty years in Hollywood movies he hasn't improved one iota and still performs with cue card timidity and paper thin characterisation. He simply doesn't have the ability to perform as anything other than a pretty face. No doubt he was a studio choice to get the women and teenage girls in to see a horror movie they otherwise may not have chosen to see. Francis Ford Copploa does a good job here and unleashes the repressed erotoscism of the original novel. He also seems to use every director trick in the book from speding up frames, to slowing them down, to reversing the action to playing it at half speed in an attempt to disorient the viewer in to accepting a dreamlike, nightmarish world of the vampire. In summary it is a visually impressive film with excellent performances and intelligently directed. But ruined by the casting of Hollywood pin-up Keanu Reeves."

Hopkins and Oldman were fantastic but Ryder(as much as I love her)and Reeves(as much as I love him) brought the film down quite a bit.Anyways maybe if I had watched more of it I would have a better opinion of it but the extreme amount of nudity was very embarrassing while watching it with my mother so although artistically beautiful(which is why I gave it a 5)it was just too ""sexy"" for my taste."

Instead, I saw a bizarre character falling in love with one of his victims. The sets, acting and cinematography were highly polished and professional, but since my pants were still dry afterward, I have to say I could not recommend it as a horror flick.

"ravravk","7","1","2","23 November 2004"," What next? Himmler as a Salvation Army worker?
","I was hardly 13 when I first borrowed the book from my local library. Stoker's language is thoroughly Victorian but much better than that of a Henry James. But he does have the knack for building up the atmosphere for terror and horror. He is a master of that, not just in this classic but in short stories such as The Squaw and Judge's House. I will not be surprised if there is universal consensus that the book made a lasting impression on all those who read it. My first Dracula film was also around that time. It was the Lee/ Cushing classic 'Horror of Dracula' on one of the many re-run tours. That was an effectively terrifying film which can deprive a young lad of sleep for many nights, when just a rustling curtain on a moonless night makes you pee. The story was not exactly faithful to Stoker but the broad outline conformed. Most people know the story or would have read a synopsis elsewhere, so I will not get into that. It is not easy to translate that horror to screen, and to avoid getting cheap like the Elm Street folks. Sequels followed and several other versions appeared with different actors, but none came to close this one (Salem's Lot was a reasonably good rendition of the book but commercially available tapes and DVDs are severely edited).<br/><br/>Then in 1992 Coppola made his 'Dracula'. Coppola's Dracula had the best visuals. I think no one can surpass this master film-maker for the sets of the castle, the use of visual signals, the final chase and so many other things. Take the scene where the masked horseman picks up Harker at the pass. That was one great scene. And then, when Harker enters the castle for the first time. Nice touches like the Count's letter signed 'D' (people don't write like that anymore, do they?), the doomed schooner, I can go on. All these make this film visually an intensely satisfying experience, at least for fans of classic horror like me. When I think of the ill-conceived and inconsistent story lines, and bad direction of recent films like Sixth Sense and The Others (let alone your teenager slasher films), I think this film stands out. To repeat, visually, this is the best Dracula ever made.<br/><br/>Do I have any reservations about this movie? A big one, and posing as an influential critic for a moment, I will cut one full star, hold that, a star and a half, from five stars for that big reservation. Coppola, paying homage to the touchy-feely, post-modern and politically correct early 1990s, wants us to 'understand' Dracula. He humanizes the fellow. And that robs Dracula of his character; his entire character, and leaves the story an insipid, tame one. It is all the more disappointing because the opening sequences are so good that you hope to see more. I do not think I am giving away anything (I hope not).<br/><br/>According to Coppola, Prince Vlad (Stoker based his Dracula on this ruthless Slavic prince) is a regular sort of chap. He is a defender of Christianity against the advancing Ottoman Turks. Some Turkish chicanery leads to his wife committing suicide (to be reincarnated as Minna in an English Household). Vlad (not yet 'Dracul' the 'vampyr') returns home and mourns. In his anger, he loses faith and desecrates the church; and of course, because of that becomes the undead. About two to three hundred years later, he realizes that his darling is growing up as Minna in London. He wants to be reunited. So the ruse for buying a house in London. He has no plans for a British green card or work permit. He just wants to get her and come back home to Transylvania. If he has to bite a few lasses on the way for sustenance, so be it. He is really not a bad guy you know!<br/><br/>This is the cheesiest part of the movie's script, and it really damages an otherwise excellent film. Vlad was only an outline for Dracula. The character of Dracula derives from unmitigating evil. As Stoker tells us, he practised the arts of necromancy during his 'life', and was condemned to be the undead for all his deeds. The undead have no feelings of mercy. They only have feelings of pleasure and survival. Both derive from from eternal existence and blood sucking. It is hinted in the book that the Count has three consorts for sensual pleasures too. Until Harker gets rid of them! The Count wants to move to London because the locals in Transylvania are getting hostile, and London is a naively scientific place where he can go about unfettered and undiscovered. The Count goes after Minna in particular for revenge and for a replacement companion. Not because he always wanted her. That is the essence of Dracula. He is condemned to be the eternal undead until someone decides to liberate his soul. Till then, he will spread his evil because that is the only thing he knows, can think of and does. That is the vampire for you!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all this is lost in Coppola. I think he could have made an even better film without the cheesy concession to the post-modernists. Teenybop Romance has no place in a serious work like this. That said, casting is pretty good in this film. Gary Oldman is very good as the older Dracula. I am not so sure about his Slavic look with those dreadlocks. Keanu Reeves never looks reassuring to anyone, and he fits the role of the whining Harker very well. Anthony Hopkins does a good job as Van Helsing.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend you watch this movie with minimal lighting and no interruptions. It is a decent movie."
"mswritesalot","Null","1","2","21 September 2004"," This Dracula Sucked
","As a lifelong Dracula fan, I was hugely disappointed in this film. First of all, casting Gary Oldman as Dracula seemed as stupid to me as casting Tom Cruise as Lestat in Interview w/t Vampire. Tommy-boy looked like a ghoulish Tiny Tim in that film, while Oldman (who is a fantastic actor) looked like a geeky Brit trying to be sexy. I thought the pageantry in this film was wasted. Keanu Reeves gave his typical cardboard performance, while Winona looked pale and miserable. The only decent role was that completed by Anthony Hopkins, who manages to shine like the truly skilled professional he is in spite of being part of this neutered Dracula. <br/><br/>I wish that the director of this film had done a little research into the Dracula Appeal. It's all about SEX, of course. Forbidden fruit, dark desires, walking on on the dark side, etc. The original Dracula, Bela Lugosi, was just an odd-looking little Hungarian guy until he played the title role. Then he became a sex symbol of the era. The same did not happen for poor Oldman. My advice: stake this version of Dracula, burn it and throw the ashes into a moving body of water!"
"thecomicbox","Null","1","2","8 July 2004"," such liberties
","Where oh where do the liberties come in making this a love story? Bram Stoker's novel is a diary account of the main characters. The count is only a secondary character who has set the wheels of motion in action. This is the story of Johnathan Harker and his love Mina. Van helsing is portrayed in the movie as an eccentric by Anthonty Hopkins. What bumpkin. Van helsing was a man of honour and integrity as all the well devised characters are in the novel. They are all three dimensional except for the count who is really inconsequential to this soap-opera story. Gary Oldman, an excellent actor, totally overplays the count to the point of misrepresentation. Dracula is a novel of Victorian manners more attuned to a Jane Austen story rather than anything Hollywood or Hammer has ever come close to. The true horror of Dracula is it's misinterpretation for over 100 years than any re-imagining that has ever occurred. Read the novel and discover the real human story contained within, rather than the crap fed to you by Hollywood."

","...you might as well go all the way. In terms of production, camera work, score, and everything-but-the-kitchen-sink scene work, Donald Trump only wishes he were as rich as this film. Taken on that production level, it is almost reminiscent of a weekend with Jim Morrison in terms of excess. But somehow, this overly-sumptuousness works for such a tale as this. And yes, I do agree that in the terms of the original story, this telling is more faithful that the host of other movies made over the decades. If you have not read the original, I highly recommend it, but save it for Samhain :)<br/><br/>Individual notes: Some of the casting in this is positively inspiring, especially Tom Waits as Renfield who was superb. Of course, the ubiquitous Gary Oldman as the Count was a casting inevitability, and he did not disappoint--pulling out so much that he gave new height to The Hilt that most actors aspire to! Boy, if ever there were a candidate for a remake of The 7 Faces Of Dr. Lao...And Sir Anthony Hopkins (slight pause for a reverent bow) captures the exact mood of the entire production in this film--bold, bawdy, lush, wicked and witty. There must have been some secret delight for him to go from the vampiric doctor in ""Lambs"" to the vampire-eradicator in this film. What other actor could find so much with so little? <br/><br/>Now, the bad notes...I know that Winona Ryder was very keen on doing this film and tried her best, but she tried TOO hard, and it showed. Her accent was almost a caricature of the true British tongue, and she almost sounded like Carol Burnett imitating the Queen on her variety show. One reader commented on and questioned her gasping through the film; it could have been an attempt to look shy and easily frightened, but I'm going to chalk it up to an overly-tight corset. And where Ms. Ryder over-did her part, Mr. Reeves UNDER-did his. I, too, kept waiting for a ""dude"" to slip into his speeches. And his pronunciation of certain words had my friends and I giggling hysterically. Which is a shame, because in the book, the part of Jonathon Harker is a major and pivotal role...though not in this film, and I can't help but suspect that the fact that Harker was played by Reeves might be the reason that the Harker character was pared down dramatically from the book for this movie. But, because of the lavishness of the rest of the material, we don't miss it much. <br/><br/>And rightly so, for this is not supposed to be a true remake of the book, but rather an experience. The true Victorian feel of the book gives way to the lustiness that would never have been expressed by Stoker (maybe not even realized...??). Why do we feel such sexual magnetism about the legend of the Count? There is something very sensuous about someone entering your mind and exerting intellectual will over yours. This was never more evident than in ""Lambs"", and in this modern version of Dracula. Also, I think what makes Dracula more appealing, particularly to females, is the way he exacts what he needs. Other fabled ""monsters"" merely slash, chop, dice, shoot, etc. There is no contact with the victim. But with Dracula, he supersedes the will of the victim by engulfing their will with his, he moves in close over them, draws from them in a ""kiss of life/death""...but does not kill the women. Instead he makes them his wives. And immortals. So not only does such a character appeal to some secret side of a woman's sexuality, but also feeds the human desire to live forever. That, to me, is why the Count survives as still the most feared, yet feared not, of all the movie ""monsters"". And these facts are what this movie captures - the written fable, the primal desire AND the imagined legend. <br/><br/>So to sum up...Goth doesn't get better than this. Be prepared to laugh and lust. Give your will over to the bawdiness, and enjoy--it really is a carnival ride of a film."

"triple8","7","1","2","29 February 2004"," Oddly enthralling yet hopelessly boring in certain places.
","When I saw Dracula I went in not having read the book or knowing the story at all. That was probably a mistake. This is a movie that's extremely difficult to follow if you go in blind, not knowing the history. Therefore, there are many places where you won't really know what's going on if you don't know the history of the story.<br/><br/>In spite of that, and in spite of the flaws in the film, I did mildly enjoy this-even though I felt oddly lost at many times throughout the movie. The cinematography, as mentioned by many before me, is simply enthralling-richly gorgeous sets, breathtaking photography, the movie succeeds in setting the dark Gothic tone of the movie-on a scale of 1 to 10 the movie gets a 10 in that respect.<br/><br/>However, the reason I enjoyed this wasn't the scenery. Rather it was the almost hypnotic chemistry between Oldman and Ryder which has got to be among the strongest I've ever seen on screen. the scenes between them are so luminously beautiful, you kind of go through the whole film just to see the two of them on screen together. The casting of these two in the main roles definitely produced movie magic-when Rider utters the line""take me away from all this death"" I got shivers down my spine. Both of them gave Oscar worthy performances. But it was the on screen chemistry between them that singlehandedly fueled the movie and made it what it was.<br/><br/>In spite of that, though, there were so many flaws to the movie I couldn't give it above a 7. There was a muted quality to the sound, at times it was hard to understand what anyone was saying. Likewise, there was a choppiness through many of the scenes, a lack of smoothness that as I mentioned makes the movie extremely difficult to follow and frankly when Rider and Oldman are not on the screen the movie is at times boring. I wish the movie had flowed more smoothly then it did,and had been a bit shorter, in spite of those flaws there is an enthralling beauty about the film which Rider and Oldman deserve a lot of the credit for. My rating is 7 out of 10. A good movie with some great moments-but not perfect."

"jaywolfenstien","Null","1","2","18 November 2003"," Vision of Coppola and Stoker
","Only Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow can match the wonderful fantasy visionary that Coppola's '92 rendition of Dracula brings to the silver screen.  Where music and imagery combine to narrate on its own level above the dialogue and its subtext.  But Coppola takes this beautiful film one step further and laces it with a talented cast and crew that further develops the story we're all familiar with and have seen/read countless times.<br/><br/>Most notable is Gary Oldman's performance under varying degrees of makeup, semi-reminiscent of Orson Welles in Citizen Kane minus the flashbacks. Coppola and Oldman reinvent the nefarious count in a way that's neither Max Shreck nor Bela Lugosi; Dracula has that surreal sense of elegance found in Lugosi's performance, but possesses both a visual and more subtle monstrosity found in Nosferatu.  In essence, Oldman plays a hybrid of the two old-school Dracula images . . . but not really.  It's more like an homage or a simple nod in their direction, while Oldman goes off on his own way.  I really appreciate this approach, and it's refreshing to see a new, very distinct, incarnation of Dracula.  <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins plays Van Helsing in a way that reminds me of a hyped up version of Edward Van Sloan, though I won't criticize Hopkins for it. Whether intentionally derivative or not, when looking on screen I saw more Van Helsing than Anthony Hopkins, and that's always a plus in my book.  In fact, I was impressed with most of the main players for the level they developed their characters.  Perhaps not to the point of George C. Scott's Patton or Dustin Hoffman's Raymond Babbitt, but if I keep the comparison within the horror genre I draw blanks as to when a cast performed this well.<br/><br/>The surreal fantasy nature of the film's atmosphere bled into the performances, enhancing the experience of watching a dramatized novel with a few anchors in reality.  At the same time, Dracula feels apart from the genre it Â‘belongs' to.  Coppola does not bow to cheap scares or gimmicks. Instead he throws all that away, and relies upon Stoker's solid novel, his more-than-competent film crew, and the talented cast he assembled to keep the audience's interest . . . like all films really should do. <br/><br/>
I also appreciate the film's unique score provided by the little known and underrated (yet very talented) Wojciech Kilar, whose utilizes what sounds like a primitive orchestra combined with a sound seldom heard in film.  It works beautifully for this score.  Very dark, very appropriate.  It stands as well alone as it does with the film.   <br/><br/>I appreciate it when a director has enough faith and trust in his material and resources to not pull a fast one every half hour or find a gimmick to hide behind.  Bravo Coppola & crew."
"bregund","Null","1","2","19 October 2003"," The accent is on bad accents
","***There are spoilers in this review.***<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola is one of those people who works best as a starving artist.  During the production of the Godfather films, he was constantly kept on the fence, wondering whether he would be fired the next day.  The result?  Two brilliantly executed films, among the best of American cinema. Will Coppola ever meet or exceed his early directorial efforts?  Thirty years and many mediocre films later, it seems doubtful (witness `Peggy Sue Got Married').  Maybe he needs to lose all his money so he can be a starving artist again, and won't produce another `Jack'.  I wonder what kind of fantastic film could be produced then.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't know what I liked least about Dracula:  Keanu Reeve's fright wig halfway through the film, the uneven direction, the disembodied voiceovers, the terrible accents, the disorienting double exposures, or the general bad acting.  How do you mess up Dracula, one of the most popular novels of all time?  Given millions of dollars and an army of talented people, Coppola manages to screw it up.  That aside, the costumes and sets are rich and lavish, immersing you in the place and time, and the special effects and makeup are quite good.  <br/><br/>Gary Oldman is a wonderful actor but, like Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Jason Leigh, his talents are best displayed at the hands of a capable director who can harness the histrionics.  Here he lets loose and hams it up.  Do we really need to hear Dracula cry?  Or watch him in orgiastic ecstasy as Mina laps up his blood?  I'm shuddering as I type this.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder is too petite, fragile, and snotty to play movie heroines.  She has beautiful features, but her tinny voice does not carry very well, and despite what must have been hours and hours of English accent coaching, her California hippy inflections stubbornly remain.  And who can ever understand the inexplicable popularity of Keanu Reeves, whose acting ability consists largely of open-mouthed stares.  His mouth is open for roughly one-third of the film.  And poor Anthony Hopkins, saddled  with his own terrible accent, looking inordinately lost and befuddled in this messy film after his groundbreaking role as Hannibal Lechter in the Silence of the Lambs. Heh-heh, the only English actor in the bunch, and they give him a lousy accent.  Wait, I'm forgetting the watery-eyed Richard E. Grant, who somehow manages to never, ever look comfortable in any film he's ever done.<br/><br/>Because much of the movie features people standing around and talking, the overall impression I got of this film is that it's an updated version of those old Hammer movies.  Did Coppola watch back-to-back Hammer films as inspiration for Dracula?  I half-expected to see Christopher Lee somewhere in this mess, standing somewhere and talking, and drinking a brandy, in a Hammer-like way.<br/><br/>To sum up, this film is alternately funny and campy as it strives to reach dramatic depths and continuously comes up short.  The film is stuffed with half-finished scenes that have little to do with each other, leaving a curiously empty feeling not unlike the way you feel after watching a short-film festival."
"DrEbert","Null","1","2","5 October 2003"," Lots of spectacle and little story; Has its flaws and strengths, but ultimately does not quite succeed
","Though this film probably bears more resemblance to the original novel than any other film version, a movie called BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA should remain relatively faithful to the original story.<br/><br/>This film starts with the story of Vlad the Impaler, a sequence that is filmed well and gives a context for the story. After that, it starts where Bram Stoker starts the novel and for about twenty or so minutes, is faithful. Though Keanu Reeves clearly cannot do a British accent, this portion of the film is done well.<br/><br/>But then, things start to change. The novel and the film start to go their separate ways. The novel provides a motive for Dracula's desire to go to England; the film does not. There is also absolutely nothing resembling a love story in the novel, but considering that this film is made by Francis Ford Coppola, I am not surprised that there is one in the film.<br/><br/>I don't mind Coppola changing the story, though I wish he had picked some other title if he was going to do that. Where this film fails is in the ability to tell that story.<br/><br/>This film depicts a series of events that have very little linking them. If I had not read the novel right before watching this film, I would surely have been lost. Things happen, but we don't really know why or how. The best example I can think of for this is Arthur's change from a complete skeptic to a vampire hunter in less than five minutes. The film also makes heavy use of superimposed and flashing imagery that confused me as to what was real, what was dreamed, what was imagined, and what was ""real but unreal.""<br/><br/>This brings me to one of the strengths of the film. The depiction of the Gothic environment and terrifying moments of the story are laden with special effects. This, at the same time, is one of the film's flaws. The subtlety of the Dracula story and its many aspects--the hints towards the vampire's true nature, the transformation of Lucy, and the sexual innuendos--are lost. There is nothing subtle about this film, especially with the sexuality.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that one of the keys to the Dracula story is its sexual overtones. The bite of a vampire is, in many ways, a form of rape. But this film depicts the concept so explicitly that it loses the mysterious and Gothic mood. (Mina is probably the only female character we do not see topless.)<br/><br/>The same holds true for the film's depiction of blood. Blood, the root of the vampire, is also shown so frequently and in such high quantities that its subtle and mysterious nature is lost.<br/><br/>There are certain things that are true strengths for the film. I happen to really like one scene where a vampire is destroyed with the standard stake-through-the-heart with decapitation. In this scene, the vampire is decapitated, the head goes flying, and the scene immediately cuts to a dinner scene. A flying decapitated head is juxtaposed with roast beef. Enough to make you go vegetarian, no?<br/><br/>Also, even though the love story does not hold much as a story, it has a very fitting and suitable ending with heavy religious overtones. It tries to end the way it begins, and though it doesn't succeed, it gets pretty close.<br/><br/>As far as the characters go, I don't know what to say. None of them are developed, except maybe Dracula. It's hard to discuss characters or even care for them when we know so little about them from the way they are depicted. From what I saw, I can say the following: Van Helsing is an eccentric and unrealistically well-versed old man, Jonathan Harker is mute and weak (and suffers from unexplained hair color loss), Lucy is a playful and somewhat rebellious young lady, Mina is slightly uptight and very seduceable (is that a word?), and Dracula is an extremely emotional tragic villain (that's right, I feel sorry for the monster).<br/><br/>I still hope for the day when a film will be made that depicts Bram Stoker's novel faithfully. Until then, this film is the closest thing to it, but it's still far enough away that I don't think it deserves to bear the name of Dracula."
"kidwltm","9","1","2","10 July 2003"," Visually Impressive, and Not Too Bad Elsewhere
","Francis Ford Coppola has always been a two-faced director.  He can be subtle and atmospheric in his style, or he can go all out crazy with visual element of his production.  He is great either which way.  This film and ""Apocalypse Now"" are the only two Coppola films that are really swamped with visual beauty.  Sweeping cinematorgraphy and terrific set designs only enhance the splendor.  It may be too much for some to take, but I personally hold no objection to visual indulgence in film.<br/><br/>So, we established the incredible technical production of the feature, but I needs mention the film does have problems.  The acting, for the most part, is either below average.  Winona Ryder, whose usually rather good, fails to present anything other than acting either incredibly stupid or horny. Hopkins, as so frequent later in his career, just sleep walks through his role.  Gary Oldman is the best of the cast as the title character, though he does (as usual) go a little over the top at moments.  As far as Keanu Reeves goes, I doubt anyone was expecting him to be good anyway.<br/><br/>The screenplay is above average, but not superb.  Firstly, cinema and books are two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT forms of artistic expression, and no  one should evaluate the quality of one based on the other.  That said, the dialogue well written, and the film kept a linear focus, good for what Coppola was trying to achieve.<br/><br/>If you don't like an overload of visuals in your film, or are pre-determined to hate it because it varies from the source material, stay away from this film.

Sure, the characters have the same names and the plot is mostly the same, but the crucial mistake the screenwriter made was trying to turn this horror thriller into a love story.  The result is grotesque and absolutely off-putting.  Instead of being wickedly seductive and menacing, this Dracula is a whiner, constantly bawling about his lost love and staring at her pathetically with a hangdog expression.  Maybe this would have worked, if Mina had not reciprocated (heaven knows why) the monster's feelings.  Then his lust for her  would truly have been terrifying, because he would want to turn her into a vampire against her will.  But this Dracula swears he will never harm her, which immediately and proposterously takes all the menace out of the film.  Unlike the novel, none of the characters in the film is sympathetic, except THE WRONG ONE (ie the villain)! Why don't they just all get on with it and die in the mass orgy the director seems to think they want?  Jonathan is a stiff, Seward is himself a psychotic, Van Helsing is a pervert and Quincey and Arthur's roles are almost non-existent.  And this film perversely propagates a stereotype of women that is stuck in some chauvinist's wet dream.  From the start, which does not fit in at all with a Victorian sensibility, Mina and Lucy act like two libidinous nymphomaniacs just waiting to burst out of their corsets, as if women are just all hanging around, waiting for some wierd wolf-monster to ""liberate"" them. Everything about this film is excessive, over the top and absurd: the acting, the special effects, the cinematogrophy.  I guess there'll never be a film true to the novel, since this film doesn't reference the novel, but the hundreds of vampire films that have gone before it.  If you want to groan as another character screams maniacally (oh, I forgot, this is the measure of good acting these days) or laugh at a supposed romantic moment, then by all means, watch this film, excruciating for all the wrong reasons.  2 out of 5."

","The best film Francis Ford Coppla ever made in my opinion. This magnificent production deals with Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) finding a woman (Winona Ryder) in the 1800's who resembles his long lost love who killed herself many centuries earlier. Gary Oldman turns in the performance of his career with this effort; he is romantic, scary, and captivating while changing from young man to an old ghoulish looking old man to a beast. Winona Ryder also does her best work in this film also; she captures the right balance between innocence and terror. Even Keenua Reeves who was something of a joke at the time of this production is credible. The costumes and sets are lush and breathtaking and the make-up effects are frightening. The film does an admireable job of balancing its romance sub-plot between the terror. And the film is always entertaining and haunting in its own way, especially the ending.

","It's very difficult to say whether this film is good or bad.  I found the gore excessive (the movie teeters as if on the tip of a needle, without falling into either the drama or horror pools), and I found the levels of nudity and sexuality (note:  I found the ""brides of Dracula"" and ""Lucy meets the Dracula/wolf hybrid creature"" scenes to be disgusting and disappointing in the extreme) quite superfluous and repulsive; still, the majority of the images in this film and the way it's played out make it very attractive and memorable.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder's performance is fairly enjoyable.<br/><br/>The two other major players in this film are more enjoyable.  Gary Oldman plays a very good Dracula with whom it is difficult not to sympathize (well, most certainly not when he's renouncing God, but later in the film!).<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is set most directly against Dracula, and the viewer will no doubt spend much time cheering for him, as well.  Oh, he's fantastic, yelling with glee about Lucy's ultimate fate (""She is the devil's concubine! Ha ha!""), waving crosses at the undead and invoking God's protection.  He plays Dr. Van Helsing as much, much more fanatic and, well, enthusiastic than Stoker's original character, but this interpretation is quite entertaining, and of course the plot diverges from that of the book sufficiently that the book's portrayal of Van Helsing would have seemed out of place here.<br/><br/>By presenting the viewer with such enjoyable characters on opposite sides of the Eternal Struggle, the film attains a bit of a feeling of dichotomy and frankly left me somewhat depressed and confused.  Still, it is visually appealing (in those scenes that did not inspire its R rating), to the point that I find myself wanting to watch the exposition (including Harker's earlier experiences in Dracula's castle) and some of the Van Helsing scenes over and over.  The film lacks the depth of, for example, ""The Godfather,"" but it does show that Francis Coppola is a very competent visual director.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect, and it indulges far too much in sex and violence at times, but it is very frequently entertaining."

","This is a very good movie, and an excellent love story. Gary Oldman is Dracula. Whenever I hear the Name Dracula now I will think of Oldman not Lugosi. This monster is quite different than any Dracula seen before, he changes shape at whim. Winona Ryder plays ""Mina"", and you can't help but fall in love with her. Watch Dracula's shadow,great special effects,excellent sound, and fantastic costume/makeup. The only flaw that we found with this movie is; Dracula is so powerful how does he pass up the numerous chances to kill his pursuers,he has ample opportunity to take them all out. I have watched this movie about 40 times and still see things that I didn't notice before. Good job to all involved with this fine, fine movie."

Keanu Reeves miscast  2. Winona Rider miscast (see her in ""How To Make An American Quilt""  3.

","I like ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" just the same as ""Interview With the Vampire"", because they are both different in their own way.  Anyway, about ""Dracula"", I kind of view it as a dark romantic film with a strange twist of horror.  This film is kind of like taking the romantic elements of a William Shakespeare tragedy (such as ""Romeo and Juliet"") and adding a big taste of something dark yet beautiful, somewhat like you'd read in an Anne Rice novel.  I loved the vampire graphics with the blood and the many looks that Gary Oldham has to bring his character alive.  Winona Ryder's character, Mina, was second best next to Gary's.  It was a really good movie!"

","Despite my dislike of horror: one can't ignore a movie with Gary Oldman. This film however has little to do with horror.

But what especially got to me was the grief, the irreversibility of choices made and the inevitability of the outcome."
"Starbuck-13","9","1","2","4 May 1999"," Powerful
","This film is a good example that some stories can be re-vamped without loosing their touch.<br/><br/>In the case of Dracula, a myth I never really cared much for, an old story has been taken and been transformed into a brilliant adventure which does, unlike most other vampire flicks, not only rely on horror effects, but does rather focus on the characters and their relationships. The mild erotic touch of this Dracula version adds to the new flavour of this film, and I have to confess that I was really stunned by the visual power Coppola was able to create. Finally, the actors played great, especially Hopkins as Abraham van Helsing, always on the brink of madness. Excellent!<br/><br/>Though die-hard vampire fans probably cried out loud about this one, I think the average audience gets a total package here. The main message (""love never dies"") may sound a little bit too ""Hollywood"", but the movie has so many strong moments which are both moving and exciting that I always enjoy watching it again."

The sets and costumes are marvellous and those alone make the movie woth seeing.<br/><br/>But except for Jonathon Harker's interactions with the count at the castle, this movie is not scary. Gary Oldman is scary as the old count and he makes the film. But the rest of the movie is mystery and eroticism and there is little horror involved.<br/><br/>The characters are also somewhat different than as written. Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra are apparently nymphomaniacs. Van Helsing has been written down to nothing more than a talkative perverted  Dutchman. Thank God Renfield has been left untampered.<br/><br/>If you have to see this film, expect to be somewhat scared for the first forty minutes and awed by the ambience of the film throughout. But this is not Bram Stoker's Dracula. That Irishman would have never written characters like the ones in this film."

Later I bought the laser disc and upon subsequent viewings I was literally amazed at the artistry the director infused into the film.  Each time I view this film I am fascinated by every articulate detail.  I now have the Superbit Edition on DVD and the film looks like a beautifully rendered painting brought to life.  It's a real visual and sonic treat especially when viewed on a wide screen HDTV and progressive scan DVD player.  The eerie Dolby Digital 5.1 sound track only enhances the cinema experience.  I can now view this masterpiece at home at the best available quality than was available in the theater when I first viewed it.  Though the film tends to drag a bit especially towards the end.  It's still an amazing film to watch and it gets even better with each viewing.  It is by far my favorite version of this horror classic."

","Ahhhh, the grandest or ironies! Francis Ford Coppola, Columbia and Zoetrope Pictures have spared little expense in bringing to the screen a film all about hearts and souls, yet in a fashion almost devoid of those two essential qualities.<br/><br/>This is Dracula for the MTV generation; lotsa flash, quick-cutting, hammy performances (especially Oldman's Dracula, and Hopkin's Van Helsing is hardly a study in cool reserve, either) and little bite (pardon the pun!) Oh, and it's unmercifully overlong, to boot.<br/><br/>Much of a love story? Not really. Ryder's reedy voice and all too obvious strident histrionics negate any emotional involment. This and Oldman's scenery-chewing Drac doth a soggy blanket make. Goodness, and Mr. Woodenheart himself, Keanu, will have you yawning quicker than you can say ""Nosferatu"".<br/><br/>It would be polite at this time to commend the stunning visuals of Michael Ballhaus and the beautiful score provided by Wojciech Kilar. And I shall offer that courtesy. But it's only the most hollow of flatteries. It wouldn't be much to expect these peripherals given that this is from a studio called Columbia, a film-maker named Coppola, boasting a not inconsiderable budget. Any film these days with such credentials usually fall over the line in these areas.<br/><br/>I'll conclude by citing the movie's one outstanding achievement in emotional, connective, terms - Annie Lennox's haunting (sorry, that's two puns) ""Love Song For A Vampire"". Why is it that so many special songs with potential to lift a movie from the doldrums only appear over the credit roll? The shame of it! And this in a film indicative of the MTV sensibility. Well, I started with an irony....."

The movie started out very intringuingly, and Gary Oldman as the vampire is fairly good, but the whole thing became increasingly unraveled with the passage of time.

"HenryHextonEsq","5","1","2","13 December 2001"," Not much good.
","Bearing in mind I have seen three other Dracula adaptations I feel I am well placed to judge this picture's success and failures. Coppola and the writers clearly set out to make a more ""adult"" Dracula, giving the old Count a more ""human"" side. It is telling that he becomes more sympathetic when dressed as a young dandy, and pursues a passionate romance with Winona Ryder. While the romance was reasonably played, I didn't feel it truly added much focus to the story. Perhaps it made one root for the Count, as does the inept quality of Keanu Reeves' performance as Ryder's husband-to-be. Having said that, I don't feel, importantly, that Oldman is as good as, say Max Schreck (portraying evil incarnate) in ""Nosferatu"" (22), Bela Lugosi (portraying a charm and evil of some magnetism) in ""Dracula"" (31) or to a lesser degree Klaus Kinski (portraying a sinister-looking parasite) in Herzog's ""Nosferatu The Vampyre"" (79). Oldman is certainly adequate, but he is not outstanding, and that is what one needs for a Dracula. Winona Ryder was a little bland, one might say, but reasonable, in a more substantial female role than was given in earlier versions. Sadie Frost is passable as a somewhat flighty dame, but it is a performance of not much subtlety. Anthony Hopkins really is absurd as Van Helsing, making him pretty much a madman; certainly hammed-up, and not up to the definitive Edward Van Sloan of the Lugosi version. Tom Waits gives probably the most effective performance as everybody's favourite lunatic, a Mr Renfield. He imbues the part with empathy, madness and absurdity, if only having a few scenes. Nearly as good as Dwight Frye in the 1931 film, but lacking Roland Topor's truly insane laugh in Herzog's filming. Richard E. Grant, Bruce Campbell and Cary Elwes are seldom used; a pity. Least said the better about Reeves; he's patently only there to draw in the 1992 multitudes. And now to atmosphere; well, there really ain't enough of it; whether it's predictable music (Philip Glass's new minimalist score for the Lugosi one is superbly fitting and atmospheric), over-ripe acting, under-cooked acting or a lack of economy in the script, it's clear this is lacking. It is directed reasonably by the formerly great Francis Ford Coppola, but is nowhere near films like ""The Conversation"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" in terms of memorable imagery or impact.<br/><br/>Plusses? Well, there are some; Waits, the attempt to go into the Dracula character in more depth, larger female roles, some very effective moments here and there. However, I cannot say I liked the ""prologue"" which attempts to root Dracula into some slightly melodramatic past. This just didn't work for me. <br/><br/>Most tellingly, I just wasn't as entertained by this movie as by the other 3, and I don't feel it to be as well-crafted or atmospheric as those three films, which do each have their flaws, but are on the whole excellent.<br/><br/>Rating:- ** 1/2/*****"
"harri_b","Null","1","2","24 November 2001"," what a way to ruin a great story..
","i am sorry but this movie defines suckiness. i thought it would be impressive at least..francis ford coppola is a pretty cool guy, right? and the cast is superb..though i am never quite sure why keanu reeves was ever cast as anything. but i was wrong. much of the acting is wooden and pretty damn unfeeling. keanu reeves' and winona ryder's pathetic attempts at an english accent are laughable..wot no voice coach? the count, though suitably scary-looking, also looks like something out of star trek. gary oldman sadly overdid his acting, as per usual. keanu reeves simply makes a fool of himself with his dull acting and non existent presence, dreadful haircut, and aforementioned terrible english/american valley guy mixed accent. winona ryder is pretty but bland in comparison to the bright and lovely sadie frost, and her accent sucks too. the texan drawl of the american dude is sadly overstated, just when you thought things couldn't get any worse. the story has been ruined..anyone who has actually read bram stoker's novel can see that. for example what's with lucy westenra's character?? she has been morphed into some kind of nymphomaniac, whereas in the book she is written as a kind and sweet young girl, which is why everyone cares so damn much about her anyway. the beautiful use of descriptive language used in the book's collective diary entries has been abridged in such a way that we hardly believe such supposedly literate individuals could write that kind of 8 year old's account of important events. credit is due to superb performances from the brits amongst the cast..richard e grant is a convincing and brilliant dr.seward, sadie frost is perfect as lucy westenra, and anthony hopkins plays the role of van helsing beautifully. it is, sadly, half what it could have been. despite cast members salvaging some credit, this is a thumbs down. :("
"The_Core","8","1","2","16 November 2001"," It Grows...
","""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is one of those films that absolutely *demands* repeat viewings to appreciate.  The first time I saw it I would have rated it a 4 or 5 maybe, but it has only 'grown on me' over the years.<br/><br/>The movie never takes itself seriously, which may disappoint horror fans looking for 'the real deal', as suggested by the film's title and director. Truly corny/inane lines of dialogue are regularly followed by inspired passages, creating an engaging, quirky experience.<br/><br/>One of the geniuses of this movie is the playing off of one of the world's worst actors (Keanu Reaves, in what has to be his flattest, most sophomoric and lifeless performance to date) against one of the best (Gary Oldman, who's obviously relishing this role) -- the contrast creates a fascinating film dynamic in which Reeves' character seems to almost disappear from the screen, while making Gary Oldman's acting (as Dracula) appear ten times better.  It almost seems as though the casting was planned that way -- anyway, it works well.  <br/><br/>Tom Waits (as Renfield) gives a real gem of a performance here... sadly, he gets very little screen time.  Winona Ryder is... well, Winona Ryder.  Her character works as Jonathan Harker's fiance, but not nearly as well as Dracula's 'love interest'.  Anthony Hopkins plays a darkly comic Van Helsing, yet another truly enjoyable performance.<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes are toward the beginning of the film, in the castle. One really gets the impression of dark, squiggly things hiding in corners and terrifying secrets kept over centuries.  As always, Gary Oldman grabs and holds your attention, smoothing over plot sections that might start to stutter and drag in the hands of a less seasoned actor.<br/><br/>It definitely takes repeated viewings to get to the point where you're really questioning (and understanding) what's happening there on the screen -- and when it finally clicks, the movie 'works' exceptionally well as a 'kitchen sink' horror/comedy/tragedy/romance.  In all likelihood, you won't enjoy it too much the first time (except for select performances), but reserve your judgment and try again a few months later.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Ok, plain and simple, i loved this movie.<br/><br/>There is very little else to say to be honest, this movie had everything in it which i think makes a good movie. It has cute actors (Keanu Reeves...) it has a MAJOR bad guy (Dracula) and also it has a soppy, but (somehow) believeable love story stacked in the middle! This movie fortutantly, relys on the ""old"" method of doing effects, there is some CGI filming technolgy here, but it is alot of old fashioned techniques used as well, and in my opinion this is what makes the movie the more freaky!<br/><br/>I love the scenes at the castle and also the characters add to the movie as well, you can't have a movie as creepy as this and then have some crappy characters who don't know how to act! This is why i thought the film and the characters were well thought out and extremely well made.<br/><br/>I like the fact that in this movie they FINALLY use Ol' ""Vlads"" powers as they were meant to be i.e. He CAN sustain direct sunlight, but it bloody weakens him unlike the myth which says he can't. So i was glad to see that go in. Also i liked the love story behind it and how God forgives all in the end, it made me wanna cry... NOT! But it was a well crafted story line and it did have its moments, i wish i could tell you what they were.. but if you're looking for a movie in which you don't have to worry about how much the director has put into special effects, this movie does have special effects, but they don't domainate it like other movies *COUGH PHANTOM MENANCE COUGH!*<br/><br/>Go see this movie, have a few chills at the scary movies and then go home with your b/f or g/f and wonder if you could really last over 600 years (or so) in waiting for your true love, it makes you think don't it?"

The plot is interesting at times, with some incredible eye-popping visuals (especially the final half-hour).  Although, I felt that the romance between Dracula and Mina Harker (Rider's character) was unnecessary, and just made a feeble attempt to play on the audience's emotions.  But, the first few minutes of the movie, which tells about Dracula before he became a vampire,  were very well-done (although not a part of the novel).<br/><br/>If you are looking for a faithful adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel, you'll just have to hope somebody makes one someday.

So anyways, you know the story, let's not dwell in that. Let's talk about how Coppola made this film, one of the most beautiful at it's time, using great ambience and lightness in it's pictures. Many people think it's a horror-film, but compared to ""I know what you did last summer"", ""Scream"" and other abominations, Dracula is so elegant by comparasing.<br/><br/>The story suffers a little from the adaption. There is a lot of so on and so forth, and many of the characters seem weakly drawn, and vague. Directors have to remember that NO we did not read that seven thousand page epic of a story, before entering the cinema. This is, at times, forgotten by the director of this film.<br/><br/>But who cares? With Oldman, Hopkins, Ryder, Reeves and even Tom Waits, you tend to let the story slip out your mind, as you enjoy the violent, beautiful pictures, and the wonderful gothic score of Wojciech Kilar, ending with ""Lovesong for a Vampire"" by Annie Lennox, the greatest lovesong of all.<br/><br/>You're gonna see this one, and you're gonna love it.<br/><br/>9/10"

The one thing which bugs me is Keannu Reeves, which proves how untalented he is, without ruining the movie. I mean, you have to pity the guy for being such a lame actor in such an incredible cast.

At least `Nosferatu (1922)' made it's point and was done.  This film had every little detail, and kept going on.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman was a terrible Dracula.  They could've at least made him look like Count Orlock rather than a stylish character.  Or, if they wanted a stylistic character, than they could've casted a better actor, that wasn't so ugly.  Maybe more of a nice face.  It just seemed too weird that a guy as ugly as Gary Oldman, could get with a hot woman like Winona Ryder.  But it wasn't just his looks, he was too old also.  If you want to see a good Dracula movie, see Nosferatu.<br/><br/>On the upside, the casting and acting was great; besides Gary Oldman.  It really respected it's story, and made it one of a kind.

","**Warning - it's got spoilers**<br/><br/>This film had SUCH potential. It had a talented crew, great cast (disregarding the two Hollywood beauties) and the story is timeless. But, like most films based on books, this was absolutely terrible. It is clear, in my opinion, that to truly enjoy this film, you must never ever read Bram Stoker's book which, unfortunately, is one of my favourites.<br/><br/>
The first half an hour of the film was okay-ish. It's even forgivable for the Lucy/Mina kiss, but by the time Lucy died, it either got boring or plain bizarre. Coppola completely twisted the book out of proportion by making Mina fall in love with 'Prince Vlad' who in the book she never met until near the end(I know, I'm so picky).<br/><br/>The supporting cast was wonderful, including a wonderful Hollywood debut by Sadie Frost. Richard E Grant and Anthony Hopkins were wonderful, as always, and, although Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were possibly not the best piece of casting, they put up valiant efforts, and Gary Oldman was a brilliant Dracula, although nothing could ever compare to his predecessors.<br/><br/>

The standout turn has to be Keanu Reeves' ludicrous attempt at playing a refined Englishman... but really hardly anyone comes out of this looking good. And the golden turkey has to go to Coppola himself for guiding this mess. What WAS he thinking? The most successful efforts are around the periphery... for example Richard Grant as Dr. Jack Seward manages to deliver a performance of which he need not be ashamed, which in the midst of this farrago is quite a testament.

","""Dracula"" is one of the most popular characters in film history.  Yet, few 'vampire' films are on the same level as ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". <br/><br/>
Even though it's no secret that Coppola watched ""Nosferatu"" (the best of the genre) before making this film, Coppola has added his own touch.  I can't think of any 'Dracula' film that started with the historical background of Vlad the Impailer in Romania/Transylvainia; nor can I think of a film director that captured the Victorian era better than Coppola (I love the stag film shown in the background during the 'white-wolf' scene in London). Finally, Coppola actually read the Bram Stoker book:  reading the source novel doesn't seem to be a popular Hollywood practice.<br/><br/>I'm surprised at the negative reviews this film has received.  Coppola has guts for filming a big budget picture on sets, especially after losing it all by doing the same thing with the Las Vegas settings of ""One From the Heart"".  The sets and costumes were brilliant, as well as the cinematography (it reminded me of 'Excalibur'). Finally, Gary Oldman makes Bela Lugosi look like a boy scout.<br/><br/>Coppola has made a couple of bad movie's in his career (need I mention ""Jack""?), yet ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is not one of them."

"utku_kamil_ozen","4","2","7","9 November 2019"," Almost Everything About the Film is Wrong
","First of all, I must preface this review by letting you know that I am not necessarily a big fan of vampire films, but I have nothing against them either, they are like any other kind of movie to me.<br/><br/>I've recently started reading the book and I decided to see the movie, while I am half way through the book. First thing that I can list among many other things the movie has done wrong is that its tone is totally different than the book, the book is not campy! I hate when people make movies as if they are telling children tales for grown-ups. This movie does exactly that. For the same reason, I don't like the hobbit films, despite the fact that I love The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But to be fair to Peter Jackson, The Hobbit is a children's book. But Dracula isn't, so, Coppola has really no excuse of making a mockery of the book and then going further and calling it 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'. No, it's Coppola's Dracula and it, in my opinion, sucks.<br/><br/>Another major wrong of the film is the casting. Young Winona Ryder is indeed a beautiful woman. But I cannot imagine her as Dracula's bride. She has sort of a childish beauty, more fitting to a college girl role or something. For Dracula's bride, I would imagine a woman who is more exotic looking or somehow beautiful and unsettling at the same time. When Winona's character turned vampire(sort of) she wasn't intimidating at all, she is too adorable and childlike. Olivia Wilde comes to my mind as an example, who would make a great bride for Dracula, though I am aware, she was probably a kid when this movie came out, it is just an example. I had the same feeling for Gary Oldman, I can't picture him as Dracula. He just looks weird as old Dracula and he looks comical with that mustache when he turns to young Dracula. Keanu Reeves is just horrible in this. He is even more emotionless than usual. Anthony Hopkins, an actor I really like, was also miscast in my opinion and he, like most other actors in the film, just hammed it up. And lastly, although I don't have any problem with the actress who played Lucy, she is the one character that is most butchered by the film. She is totally different in the book, such a sweat and likable young woman with dignity. Weirdly, she is portrait as sl*t in the film. Some of the attributes that she gains after turning a vampire, like being seductive, etc. are given to her character as her default attributes in the film.<br/><br/>Then there are the weird edits and comical looking miniatures. It's really hard to believe that the same person who made The Godfather has also made this film. There are weird technical and artistic choices that baffles you and reminds you the bad movies that are unintentionally funny. For the sunset deadline scene, it seems like they've filmed for several different sunsets then decided to use them all at once. Some of the edits are like a bad dream and I don't believe they are intentionally so, for they are unrelated to characters' horror, fever moments.<br/><br/>I'll finish saying there are some good ideas here and there, but they are just buried under so many mistakes. I can understand that some people can enjoy this film, so I am not gonna make a positive or negative recommendation, but I can't stress it enough that this is not Bram Stoker's Dracula, it's Coppola's..."

","An unconventional film adaptation, Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 blockbuster has aged well, with the passage of time smoothing out some of its more glaring faults. Although the performances are distractedly weak (in particular Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder and a buffoonish Anthony Hopkins), there's no denying the visual beauty and power of Coppola's technical approach. Employing just about every cinematic tool within his arsenal, Coppola's version of Bram Stoker's immortal novel focuses on opulence and splendor over the less savory aspects of its blood-soaked story, and the result is a peculiar, unique horror entry that often feels like several movies playing at once. It's a confusing, majestic, inconsistent, frustrating, and splendidly entertaining movie unlike anything else, and remains deeply fascinating even decades later. Amidst a sea of weak performances, watch for a stunning vampiric turn by Sadie Frost as Lucy, who walks away with the movie."

"goreilly40","8","1","3","11 May 2018"," Different but still good
","When comparing this adaptation to Stoker's novel, it is more faithful than others but the story has an added element to it, that of romance and love over time. This element along with the back story at the beginning and the explanation as to why Dracula is the way he is, makes him a more complex character, you think of him more as a tragic hero, and as such puts him in a more sympathetic light than his pure evil counterpart in the book. Gary Oldman as the title character is brilliant as he displays the Count's many different faces, from the tragic hero, to the monster to the charming seductive younger version, so much so you almost pity him when he meets his demise at the end. The rest of the cast, with one exception are all very good as well, Anthony Hopkins as the legendry hunter Van Helsing in particular is excellent. The only downside was Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker, his performance, accent included was very unconvincing and wooden. Winona Ryder in her duel role as Mina/Elisabeta is another one who stands out, her performance was really convincing as someone who was at first terrified, then falls for the Count. <br/><br/>The movie portrays both 1897 London and Transylvania perfectly, it is also well paced, you feel gripped by it and the chase at the end is very exciting and makes for a good ending.<br/><br/>The actual story, like the title character is more complex with added elements that make it fascinating and the changes don't adversely affect it. <br/><br/>If your a fan of the original novel, then this is an adaptation you'll really appreciate and enjoy, just be prepared for a different and more complex but not a weaker story."

"tapio_hietamaki","10","1","3","21 January 2017"," A faithful adaptation with flashy cinematography
","Francis Ford Coppola called his film 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' which is a little presumptuous, seeing how Bram Stoker had nothing to do with the production and was indeed dead 80 years since when the movie was made. I read 'Dracula' as a boy and did an 8,000-word paper on it at the university so I can call myself an expert on the subject, and there are many things I could point out that the movie made up. However other Dracula movies differ from the novel even more than this one. All in all this might actually be the most faithful adaptation I've seen. The biggest changes are the scenes where Dracula and Mina meet in London - which never happened - the beginning with Dracula's backstory, and the ending where Mina goes after Dracula and cries on his corpse. The whole storyline about Mina being Vlad Dracula's reincarnated lover is new, but it actually makes sense and gives the movie a bit more punch so I accept it. Everything else can be derived or interpreted from the novel, I think (such as Lucy's sexuality which is obviously exaggerated but still acceptable in the light of the original text).<br/><br/>Still, the movie is more than anything 'Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula' - it's his movie, flesh and bones. It's a very flashy movie - I mean that it draws attention to itself, it's not subtle. Almost every scene has superimposed images, the pace is fast, there are a lot of special effects, vivid colors and hammy acting. It's a gorgeous movie but not for everyone, some will find it too exhausting, too in-your-face.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman's and Winona Ryder's performances are classic, and Keanu Reeves is classic in his wooden non-acting."
"hoxjennifer","5","1","3","6 November 2014"," Actually...?
","I was really excited to see this movie and had high hopes for it. I am a fan of ""true"" vampire movies (none of this Twilight business - I'm talking Interview with a Vampire, Queen of the Damned etc...) It suffices to say, I was completely mislead by rave reviews and have formed my own opinion that this movie just doesn't cut it for me. In sum, here are my reasons that, despite my generally ""nice"" movie reviews, this film gets my lowest rating yet of 5/10:<br/><br/>1) Acting: Absolutely horrible. With the exception of Winona Ryder, in my humble opinion, the major actors/actresses whose reputation was used to promote this film gave some of the worst performances I've seen. Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker had this dumb, confused look on his face for the first 20 minutes of the film that I just could not deal with. Example: As he's entering Dracula's castle and he sees wild animals and a random pit of fire, he retains the same confused look on his face that he started with at the beginning of the film. Now if I was about to enter a creepy castle and saw the flames of hell spontaneously appear before me, I think I'd react a little bit more dramatically. He sees Dracula crawling up the walls for god's sake and his face is just like ""Well, then...that's interesting.""<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins, - who I adored in Silence of the Lambs - turns into a crazed Christian fanatic. He's like the priest from the Exorcist on speed. And I'm sorry - Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula doesn't seduce me as much as he is hyped out to be. <br/><br/>2) Characterization: Now, as I mentioned, Winona Ryder's acting is tolerable. But her character, oh my god I wanted to shoot Mina. Her character makes no sense and it frustrated me so much just how wishy washy she was. I'll have to read the book to compare how she is portrayed in the book - but I have a feeling her character isn't as empty and one dimensional as this movie makes her out to be. And what of her husband, Jonathan Harker? He just seems to be okay that she basically had an affair with some random Eastern European Prince while he was away on business? He's okay with this? He doesn't put up a fight? I can't see how this can even make sense.<br/><br/>3) Storyline: Too many plot holes. Nothing makes sense. Yes, I know I'm supposed to give the benefit of the doubt when it comes to horror/fantasy but I just can't do it here. For example, what is the purpose of Lucy's character? Dracula travels to England to find Mina - so what's he doing trying to seduce Lucy? How does she become a target? I don't see what her role is in this movie other than providing titty action.<br/><br/>4) Discontinuity: Is it just me or was anyone else confused throughout the whole film (besides poor Keanu Reeves of course...)? The cuts between scenes made absolutely no sense. For someone who hasn't read the book (which I understand is written in letters and newspaper clippings so I can see why it would be cut so much) - the movie just doesn't flow. I see no character development. I don't see we go from Point A to Point B. I just don't get it.<br/><br/>I read some of the reviews here where users gave 1/10 and agree wholeheartedly with these reviews. But I am a little more generous, and will agree that this movie deserved the Academy Awards for costume and makeup. The setting was beautiful, and I did enjoy the costume (although Dracula's hair was admittedly very distracting). I can see why this became a cult classic, but I just don't see it being as amazing as it is being hyped up to be. On further note, I am biased as I haven't read the book and will need to do a thorough comparison to educate myself more on the matter but as for first impressions - this movie just doesn't cut it."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","3","24 May 2014"," Pompous, overblown, flawed...but not without merit
","BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is a lavishly Gothic adaptation of the Stoker novel, directed by Francis Ford Coppola like he's doing an imitation of Tim Burton. This is Dracula as high camp, with a highly theatrical performance from Gary Oldman (with tongue firmly in cheek) playing the Count as both an old-time romantic and modern-day ghoul. Let's be clear: Oldman's performance is far from definitive (that honour goes to Christopher Lee), but it is memorable.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the film is hit and miss. For every hit there's a miss, for every great idea there's one that doesn't work. The art direction and set dressing is top notch, and I appreciate all the artiness of the direction; the stuff in the skies, the blood fountains like something out of Kubrick's THE SHINING, the overblown musical score. Elsewhere, the special effects have dated considerably, particularly Dracula's transformation into a cheesy giant bat. Plus the whole romantic sub-plot drags things down and goes nowhere.<br/><br/>The cast is equally mixed. Anthony Hopkins really gets into the spirit of the thing, delivering a performance loaded with high camp as Van Helsing. Tom Waits's Renfield is arresting, Cary Elwes and Richard E. Grant are fine in minor parts, and somehow Sadie Frost works as the sexually frustrated Lucy. But two of the main parts are given to Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, and it's clear from the outset that their hearts aren't really in it. They give dejected, dispirited and artificial performances, which isn't great.<br/><br/>Still, with all the gory effects and imaginative interludes on offer, BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is a film that it's hard to dislike. Indeed, when I first saw it as a 14-year-old boy, I loved it to bits. Many years later, it feels deeply flawed, a movie that's all over the place. Coppola's scattershot film-making works in some places and not in others, and it's fair to say this is a bit of a mess. A riotous, entertaining mess, but a mess nonetheless."
"MissSimonetta","8","1","3","20 May 2014"," Over-the-top but fun
","I don't think anyone's ever made an accurate adaptation of Bram Stoker's vampire novel, though this one comes close. Honestly, this Dracula (1992) feels more like a remake of the basic story of The Mummy (1932) in that the villain is a centuries old undead creature who has damned his own soul once he loses the woman he loves, and his main goal is to reunite and possess her reincarnation in the modern world.<br/><br/>The film is hindered by poor supporting performances and downright silly moments. Keanu Reeves is shockingly bad as Johnathan Harker, making the oft-criticized David Manners in the 1931 version look like Laurence Olivier in comparison. Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, and Sadie Frost have their share of both serviceable and cringe-worthy moments.<br/><br/>I found the lack of subtlety in the handling of the story's themes of sexuality to be laughable. For example, I know Lucy's supposed to be more openly sexual and man-hungry, but when she started spitting out those ridiculous double entendres that only a sixth grader would giggle at, I could not help but think it was a little overboard.<br/><br/>The film is saved from total mediocrity by the spooky atmosphere, its haunting and romantic musical score, and most of all, through Gary Oldman's performance as Dracula. He's not the evil creature from the novel, but he does succeed in being simultaneously threatening and sympathetic, no easy task.<br/><br/>Once again, don't expect a perfect recreation of the novel, but it is an entertaining, if flawed, vampire film. I'd certainly watch it over the 1931 Browning version, and this is coming from someone who loves 1930s horror."

"C22Man","8","1","3","29 October 2013"," Lavish, scary and engaging despite its problems.
","The Dracula novel has seen a ridiculously high amount of film adaptations. But if anyone could bring something new then it probably was acclaimed Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola made some very smart decisions when making the film, mainly deciding to stick closer to the book than most and paying many tributes to the iconic images seen in vampire films of old.<br/><br/>The plot does stick quite close to the story. Young solicitor Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to sign over land to Count Dracula, who plans on coming to London to wreak havoc. However, upon seeing a picture of Harker's fiancé he believes her to be his old lover and attempts to win her heart. Although many dislike the added romance it does offer a lot and shows that Dracula does have some kind of soul, making the character more three dimensional. It also adds to the plot as it makes the film more than a struggle against a beast, but a struggle to win the heart of a person. While most argue that Dracula should be a cold monster, I think that it was a wise decision to offer a more sympathetic version as one hadn't been seen before at that point. I'm especially impressed with how the story juggled all of its elements so well, as the romance never felt forced and the scary stuff worked superbly.<br/><br/>You can forget about Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee, as Gary Oldman steals the show with ease in an incredible performance as Dracula. He encompasses every single thing he needs to in order to make the role work, he can be both savage and creepy as well as humane and somewhat loving. Oldman made Dracula someone I feared but still felt sorry for , which is no simple task. He is still identifiable in a lot of make-up and the chilling accent is spot-on. Even the way he moves and expresses seem to have been worked to perfection. Should have won an Oscar in my book.<br/><br/>The movies biggest stumbling block is with the acting however, seen with a trend of the support outshining the leads, bar Oldman, strangely. Sadie Frost puts a lot of energy in as the seductive Lucy and her feisty nature comes off well. Richard E. Grant is perfect for the part of Dr. Seward and plays the smart doctor well, even if he is underused. Both Cary Elwes and Billy Campbell do solid as can be jobs and make the most of their underdeveloped suitors. Tom Waits was also extremely enjoyable as the insane Renfield.<br/><br/>The other three leads are the source of the films main problems for me. Keanu Reeves is horrifyingly bad here, there may actually be planks of wood that have more charisma than him. He is just so wooden in everything he does, his expressions don't convey any of the fear they should and his accent always sounds too fake to be convincing. Winona Ryder never truly convinces either. She just doesn't seem to know how to convey emotion properly and doesn't kind Mina the right depth, but she is just about acceptable. Anthony Hopkins just hams it up as Van Helsing and it comes across as ridiculous (He even humps Billy Campbell's leg at one point).<br/><br/>Almost everything else in the film is spot-on. Coppola shot the film in extremely striking and attractive way, as almost every frame oozes richness. The effects are all in camera which is so impressive given the scale of some of them and they still look fantastic to this day, showing CGI isn't always needed. The costume design rightly won an Oscar. Everything fits the Victorian time frame perfectly and it looks beautiful as well as authentic. Dracula's many different costume are also outstanding. The locations look realistic as well, it really captures the gloominess of Victorian London and the makes Transylvania look like a creepy place.<br/><br/>The scary scenes were just that and I'd say the film can boast some of the most wildly scary images of any horror centred film since the 80's. The film carries a very Gothic and eerie atmosphere that allows the scary moments to develop more, this is very apparent in the sequences in the castle which are really creepy. Dracula's frequent monstrous forms are demonic and frightening, they are also really well designed and add to terrifying aspects of the character physically. Other times when the film captures a classic horror feel are seen with Harker's encounter of the Brides and the confrontation with Dracula, which both rely on mood to produce terror and it works wonderfully.<br/><br/>A lot of praise has to be given to Wojciech Kilar who composes one of the greatest scores I've ever heard. Kilar manages to create a score that has the absolute perfect balance of bone chilling and sweeping beauty. The music feels like it is coming alive at times and enhances certain scenes ten-fold. It is too great to really put into words, but it's one of the few soundtracks that can make you paranoid with fear as well as make you shed a tear of sadness. <br/><br/>So does Coppola succeed in making the ideal Dracula movie? I'm going to have to say yes. Whilst I can see that there are aspects people won't enjoy, mainly the romantic sub-plot and some of the poor acting, the film has an extremely high amount of excellent features. The production design, effects and score are some of the very best you will see in film, and visually the film is still a magnificent achievement. It also achieves many of its aims, Gary Oldman is a superb Dracula, the scary moments are very scary and it sticks very close to the book. It may not be the perfect film, but it is extremely well made and very memorable."

","Although it is not possible to ever replace Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula, Gary Oldman offers us an interesting interpretation of the most famous of vampires in Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula. This film is probably closest to the novel that Bram Stoker wrote which in fact is a series of recollections of the events of the story by its various characters.<br/><br/>Added to it is a prequel where we see that the Count back in the 17th century was a warrior repelling the Ottoman Turk invasion. But on arriving home from the wars, Oldman discovers that his beloved has died. Cursing the Deity, the Deity gets back at him by leaving him undead with a thirst for human blood. His beloved is played by Winona Ryder.<br/><br/>Flash forward to the end of the 19th century and the story picks up in many ways from the classic film with Bela Lugosi. Dracula has moved his base of operations to London to be near the reincarnated version of his true love, also played by Winona Ryder. She's slightly engaged to Keanu Reeves who is held as a prisoner by Dracula's demon wives after closing the deal on Carfax Abbey in London.<br/><br/>Dr. Van Helsing is played by Anthony Hopkins who dusts off the accent that Laurence Olivier perfected back in the day. Hopkins does overact a bit here, but the part is a showy one, almost as much as the title role.<br/><br/>I did see a college production of the play made from Stoker's novel and this one was closer than any other Dracula I've seen. <br/><br/>But with all due respect to the fine cast involved, there will never be another Bela."

","Dracula is just one of those movies that provide the opportunity to scare you no matter how many times you watch this. It's all because of the acting, costume design, and makeup.

Dracula heads to London to face his love once more.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman makes the perfect Dracula. He was the perfect choice to play the Count.

","Francis Ford Coppola is a great director, and his adaptation of Bram Stoker's widely influential novel, Dracula, is perhaps his most ambitious and technically impressive film next to Apocalypse Now. Taking a very famous story and recharging it with incredible cinematography and camera work, this is an incredible looking film; one that transports you back to the times and is completely engrossing from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The most common criticism of this movie is that the narrative is not very strong, so it makes it difficult to get emotionally involved with the characters and the story. But, I don't think Coppola was concerned about that. Instead, it is obvious that the look and feel to the atmosphere of each scene was the most critical and key part of it all. Indeed, that is what looks the best so it is the best part of the movie. I do wish that the storyline would have been more clear because there were times when I was a little confused at what was happening and who exactly these people were. Nevertheless, the acting is strong enough to support the plot and the visuals accentuate it.<br/><br/>As for the acting, the entire cast is excellent save one Keanu Reeves, who like many of his roles is so wooden and unemotional that he drains all the energy and feeling from his scenes. Putting him against a wild and charismatic actor like Gary Oldman or Anthony Hopkins hurts their performance and the scene. Still, the positives clearly outshine the negatives.<br/><br/>The sets are incredibly detailed, the costumes are first-rate, the photography is dark and seductive and the music from Wojciech Kilar is among the most effective scores I have ever heard in a movie. It had its weaknesses, but it certainly affected me and I can imagine that was all Coppola needed to know this would be a success. Besides, compared to those Twilight supernatural creatures, this movie is astonishingly accurate and convincing."

","Journalist asked once from Ernest Hemingway, what he thought now that Hollywood had destructed his books. Hemingway said something like: ""What do you mean ""destructed""?

Hart's ambitious, cinematic script follows the plot quite faithfully, but makes changes to the characters and their relationships. Costumes, studio sets and rich colour photography have fruitcake, visually glorious and romantic fairytale quality, mixing a period and the Gothic, and the music score is equally sublime. Mina and Lucy are gorgeous like angels in their dresses, full of lust for life, and Gary Oldman's Dracula is a mix of the vampiric evil and the dark grandeur. Even nicely old-fashioned special effects are lovely. Despite all the negative crap said and written about this movie, Bram Stoker's Dracula is a wonderful movie."

Oldham does fine in scenes opposing him but Ryder, who is supposed to be a weaker character, seems unreal because who could be more of a schlump than Keanu? It is a travesty that he played this part and I assume it was a studio requirement to get the movie made. Otherwise, the pace, cinematography and acting are first rate. As I said the story is not first rate, owing to the predictability of (nearly) any horror finale. Still, the ending is accomplished better than most of the genre.

","Dracula starts in Transylvania during 1462 where Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) goes to battle, hearing of Dracula's death his bride Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) commits suicide. However Dracula wasn't dead & upon hearing of Elisabeta's suicide he renounces God... Jump forward to 'London 1897, Four Centuries Later' where Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) is instructed to travel to Transylvania to conclude the sale of Carfax Abbey in London to Count Dracula who is now a member of the blood drinking undead, Harker has to leave behind his fiancé Mina Murry (Winona Ryder again) but does so & sets off. Once there Dracula imprisons Harker in his castle under the control of his Vampire Brides (Monica Bellucci, Michaela Bercu & Florina Kendrick) & travels himself to London where he meets Harker's fiancé Mina whom he believes is the reincarnation of his bride Elisabeta. Dracula drinks he blood of Mina's friend Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost) & her doctor Jack Seward (Richard E. Grant) calls in professor Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) who quickly realises that they are dealing with a Vampire & that they are in great danger...<br/><br/>Co-produced & directed by Francis Ford Coppola this is maybe the greatest adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel ever committed to celluloid, in my opinion anyway. The script by James V. Hart probably sticks to original source material more closely than any other screen version of Dracula I've seen, apparently this is the first time the Texan character of Quincey Morris (Bill Campbell) appears in any screen version & the climactic chase through the Carpathian mountains where Van Helsing uses the psychic Mina to track Dracula. It also changes a few things as one would expect since film & literature are two very different mediums & to keep Dracula himself at the forefront of the story he makes Mina the reincarnation of his dead wife & turns the story into a sensuous romantic tale which works very well. I think all the character's are great, I liked then dialogue, I liked the story & the way it moves along & I liked the back-story given to Dracula although I have to say at over two hours in length it's a touch long even though I can't really think of anything I'd like to see less of.<br/><br/>Director Coppola does a magnificent job here, I recently saw John Badham's 1979 Dracula & really liked that with it's immaculate & precise period production design which seems very historically accurate. An approach Coppola's Dracula ignores in favour of a wonderful Gothic comic book look & feel, it's very extravagant & wild as the filmmakers lets their imagination's run riot & as a result it's a joy to watch. A lot of time & effort went into the look of this film with fantastic production values, the sets, the costumes, the decor & the cinematography is all style & visual flair plus there's a great dark sexuality running through the film as well. I was impressed. There's not much in the way of gore, there are a few decapitations, a cool close up on a slashed throat & a bit of blood but little else.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 Dracula is technically brilliant apart from some truly terrible model shots, it's got a tremendous style to it & it is very well made. The acting varies, Ryder lets the cast down with a timid & forgettable performance, Oldman makes for a decent Dracula, Reeves is miscast as Harker while Hopkins overacts somewhat as Van Helsing & Grant as Dr. Seward is somewhat underused.<br/><br/>Dracula is probably the best version of the tale I've seen on the screen, I don't think there's anything I didn't like about it other than it was a bit long. It stays close to the original novel, it looks terrific, it has a good cast & it makes for good entertainment. Definitely recommended."
"barnabyrudge","8","1","3","26 July 2006"," Lush version of the old Dracula story  very well-made, though not as faithful to the book as people like to suggest.
","You might think that with a title like ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", this 1992 version of the oft-filmed tale might stick more closely to the Bram Stoker original than most of its predecessors. And there is a little truth in that, but not nearly to the extent that certain misinformed film critics would have us believe. Maltin called it a ""sumptuous retelling of the Dracula legend as originally conceived by Stoker in his 1897 novel"". Erm actually Mr Maltin, this film alters quite a lot from the Dracula of Stoker's conception. Variety was even wider of the mark, stating that this was ""both the most extravagant screen telling of the oft-filmed story and the one most faithful to its literary source"". Had either of these critics actually READ the book? I would suggest probably not. For a start, the film hinges its story on the concept that Dracula declared war on God when his bride-to-be committed suicide in the 15th Century, and after 400 years feeding off blood eventually found what he believed to be her reincarnation living in London under the name Mina Harker. Anyone who has read the book will know that none of this is taken from it. I get very annoyed when people say that this version follows the novel more faithfully than any other, because any fan of Stoker's book will be able to tell you that it really isn't all that faithful at all. Having said all that, if we take ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" on a film level  as we should, since it IS a film after all  then there's plenty here to enjoy and admire.<br/><br/>Romanian prince Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman) fights and wins a fearsome battle against the Turks in the 15th Century. The beaten Turks fire an arrow into his castle tied to which is a note that deceitfully informs his bride that he has died in battle. Upon finding the note, his bride Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) kills herself. When Dracula returns and finds her dead, he erupts into a frenzy of violence and declares war on God, vowing to rise from his own death to have his revenge. The story leaps forward to the 19th Century, where young estate agent Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) heads off to Transylvania to help a reclusive count (Oldman, again) complete the purchase of a property in London. Harker realises pretty quickly that the count is both dangerous and inhuman, but by this time he is imprisoned in the castle with no hope of escape. Dracula makes his way to England, where he spots Harker's fiancée Mina (Ryder, again) and believes her to be the reincarnation of his long-mourned Elisabeta. Dracula's big mistake is that he first vampirises one of Mina's closest friends, Lucy (Sadie Frost), thereby alerting others that he is on the loose. Famed doctor and vampire expert Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is brought in to deal with the threat posed by this ultimate Lord of the Undead.<br/><br/>The film is stunningly designed with lots of incredible visual trickery, including atmospheric red skies, point-of-view camera shots as Dracula prowls around in the guise of a wolf, clever tricks with shadows, moody lighting and awesome sets. The events on screen are brilliantly emphasised by Wojciech Kilar's tremendous score (arguably the best music score from any film of the '90s). The performances vary somewhat, with Ryder doing exceptional work as Mina Harker and Hopkins enjoying himself in a hammy yet controlled display as the vampire hunter Van Helsing. Oldman's Dracula is interestingly portrayed too, alternately threatening and tormented, intimidating and insecure. Reeves tries hard as Jonathan Harker but doesn't quite convince; Richard E. Grant and Cary Elwes are wasted in under-written roles as, respectively, Dr Seward and Lord Arthur Holmwood. On the whole ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is a very impressive achievement and a film of real depth and flamboyance. It differs from the book, so don't be fooled by those who try to say that it is the most faithful adaptation ever made. Instead, approach this one on a film level and enjoy it for its visual splendour, its amazing music and its frequently engrossing performances."
"cinemutterings","Null","1","3","16 April 2006"," Should be called Dan Curtis' Dracula or The Dark Shadows of Dracula
","This is a beautiful adaptation but it has little to do with Stoker's novel. I just finished reading it so don't even bother to argue about it. The story of the vampire's long lost love being reincarnated in Mina Harker is lifted almost directly from the main premise of each of the many incarnations of Dark Shadows - the original 60s daytime soap opera, the 1970 theatrical movie version, the 1991 revival prime-time series and the 2004 WB pilot. Francis Ford Coppola has long been on record as one of the many fans of the original series (as well as some of pop culture's most influential artists, such as Anne Rice, Stephen King and the material girl herself, Madonna).<br/><br/>In fact, Oldman's Dracula is the first of any of the countless film interpretations to be even vaguely ""reluctant."" Bram Stoker's Dracula is not even remotely vulnerable or guilt-ridden about his fate, while that remains the most distinguishable characteristic of his ""Dark Shadows"" vampiric counterpart, Barnabas Collins. Don't get me wrong, I don't think of this as a knock at all on either the movie or the integrity of Mr. Coppola. I assume this was an intentional homage to a pop culture phenomenon that has continued to reverberate long after its initial sensation. Indeed, while this show is mostly forgotten its legacy apparently lives on - in the novels of Ms. Rice and Mr. King, and, almost certainly, in this supremely altered retelling of the Dracula legend.<br/><br/>Frankly, it makes the whole thing a lot more romantic and worth watching. Christopher Lee took the Dracula-as-monster to its illogical conclusion. What's the point in trying to make it ever more bloody and violent? Vampire stories are almost never truly scary. With the exception of ""Salem's Lot"" (which itself owes much to ""Dark Shadows""), vampire movies are mostly cheesy and uninteresting to anyone over the age of 12. It works much better as romantic and - one may argue - vaguely homo-erotic drama. Surely that has something to do with Mr. Stoker's own apparently closeted homosexuality. The idea of a love that is animalistic, compulsive and ultimately causes death - that must be hidden at all costs - is certainly Victorian in its repressive view of sexuality in general, homosexuality in particular.<br/><br/>Mr. Curtis simply found a way to make the character human, as was necessary to keep him as a recurring lead character in a serialized drama. Thank goodness someone else finally had the sense to take his lead."
"domino1003","9","1","3","22 December 2005"," Oldman Breaks Your Heart
","""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is as close to the novel that we'll ever get. Under the direction of Francis Ford Coppola, we are given an interesting twist to the story and a motivating factor as to why Dracula became what he was.<br/><br/>The film opens with Dracula (Gary Oldman) about to go into battle against the Turks. His wife Elizabeta (Winona Ryder) fears for his life, knowing that there's a good possibility that he won't come back from this battle. We witness Vlad the Impaler on the job (in an interesting use of shadows, by the way), striking down his enemies in the name of God. However, his devotion to God turns nasty when he returns home to find his wife dead (She threw herself into the river because of a phony message from the Turks saying that her hubby was dead). Knowing that suicide is against God's law and that she will be damned, Vlad isn't a happy camper. And he shows it by denouncing God and cursing himself in the process, refusing to serve the God that had betrayed him.<br/><br/>The next thing we know, 400 years has passed, and Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) kisses his fiancé Mina Murray (Ryder again) goodbye, heading to Transylvania to do business with Count Dracula. Harker doesn't even care much that previous real estate agent, Renfield (Tom Waits), went insane and is now locked up in the loony bin, eating lots of bugs.<br/><br/>Harker's trip is strange (wolves, blue flames, creepy coach driver) and his stay at Castle Dracula doesn't make things easier: watching a potential client leave the castle by scaling down a wall will do that to a person). Plus, Dracula's brides make a play for him (Oh yes, a LOT of sexuality is in this film).<br/><br/>Mina during this time is staying with her childhood (and wealthy)friend Lucy (Sadie Frost). Lucy is pursued by 3 prominent men: Quincy Morris (Bill Campbell),Dr.Jack Seward (Richard E. Grant) and Lord Arthur Holmwood (Cary Elwes). But it seems that Dracula wants to have a little taste of Lucy as well, practically raping her in the form of a wolf when he arrives in England. His sole purpose is to get with Mina, who is the spitting image of his late wife. However, with the arrival of Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins, who seems to still have a little bit of Hannibal Lecter trapped inside of him) and Jonathan's escape, things get a bit complicated.<br/><br/>I absolutely adore this film (except for one thing that I will later explain). The music by Wojciech Kilar is haunting (My favorite piece is ""The Brides."") and the costumes by Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka is incredible (And won a deserved Oscar for her work). And the craft-work of Coppola shows throughout the film.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, with one exception: Keanu Reeves. Although it seems that he is really trying, he keeps slipping in and out of his English accent as badly as Kevin Costner's in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."" But it is Oldman as Dracula that shines. Dracula truly loves Mina. When Mina leaves to reunite with Jonathan, Dracula's emotions tore at the heart. After all, how many of us were broken up when the girl (Or guy)of your dreams dumped you for someone that isn't as cool as you? (Come on, Jonathan was as stale as year old crackers). The scene when Mina finds out the truth about Dracula is just as heartbreaking. Despite what he has done, she still loves him. Dracula loves her, but doesn't want to subject her to his fate (""I love you too much to condemn you"" he cries). Her answer is priceless: ""Then take me away from all this death."" Even though this may be classified as a horror film (After all, stakes and be-headings happen a lot in the film), the heart of the film is the love story. Who hasn't done something incredibly stupid for love?"
"rpawliko","7","1","3","1 November 2005"," Good but not great - some strange changes to the story line
","While I feel the film is very good, and certainly a competent retelling of the tale, I feel that it falls short of reaching the status of a ""classic"".<br/><br/>Coppola has given us an operatic ""Dracula"" One almost expects Van Helsing to break into a rousing baritone aria when he realizes that he is chasing not just a vampire, but ""THE"" vampire; and a final desperate duet between Drac and Mina at then end as they share a final kiss before she cuts off his head.<br/><br/>I found the bits of narration through the first half of the movie a bit irritating. Coppola's a master story teller - why did he need help with narration for exposition? <br/><br/>The sequence of Harker's imprisonment in Dracula's castle was, for me, the best part of the movie. Oldman's performance is quirky, spooky and fascinating as the near corpse-like count. The licking of Harker's razor after he cuts himself shaving is wonderfully disgusting. The cinematography and special effects in this sequence are great - especially the Dracula's somewhat disobedient shadow, almost an entity unto itself, sometimes with Dracula, sometimes apart from him.<br/><br/>The casting of Keanu Reeves as Harker disappointed me. So many terrific English actors, and we get the man most frequently associated with the California inflection of the word ""Dude""? He was adequate in the part, and I really think he was miscast.<br/><br/>Lot's of exposed breasts throughout the film, but especially in the first half. I couldn't help but think of Terry Thomas' admonition in ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World"", ""What is this American preoccupation with bosoms?"" <br/><br/>I can just see some executive production meeting where a rep from distribution was saying, ""look Frank, the Dracula thing's been done to death - if you want to do it, fine, but make sure you've got something to bring in the 15-25 year old boys..."" <br/><br/>Honestly, I'm not a prude, but most of this stuff was pretty gratuitous. On the IMDb, one listed anachronism was ""when Dracula bites Mina, her 20th century bikini briefs can be seen beneath her sheer 19th century night gown."" In consideration of everything else, it makes you wonder if it WAS an accident.<br/><br/>Lucy was a little too ""tartish"" for me. A tease, to be sure, but her line, ""Oooh, Quincy, what a big knife you have...""? Just doesn't fit into my idea of a Victorian woman of privilege.<br/><br/>Mina, as portrayed by Winona Ryder, was beautiful, innocent, torn between her two lovers, yet I wasn't completely won over by her character. I think this is more the problem with the story line (see below) than the actress.<br/><br/>The character of Dr. Seward, played as a borderline drug addict in charge of a mental institution was wrong for me. The character is far from the Dr. Seward of the novel and the play. When faced with good versus evil, the original character was a skeptic who must come to terms with the limits of science. As depicted in this movie, he's neither skeptic nor scientist, he's mainly just there as a vehicle to bring Van Helsing into the story.<br/><br/>I liked Anthony Hopkin's Van Helsing, although there were aspects of the character that didn't make sense to me. Why would a man, seemingly advocating an open mind to the super natural, almost in the same moment be almost callously scientific in his dealings with other people? <br/><br/>When Mina asks if Lucy was in great pain as a vampire, Van Helsing's response is, ""Yeah, she was in great pain! Then we cut off her head, and drove a stake through her heart, and burned it, and then she found peace."" It's comic, but hardly the spiritual kind of response we'd expect from Van Helsing.<br/><br/>Tom Waits turns in a very good Renfield. I think they could have backed off on the make-up just a little bit, but he does a good crazy. The scene where Renfield asks to talk to Mina, and and ends up blessing her was terrific. We fear for Mina, and we want to find some way to help poor Renfield, but know he is doomed.<br/><br/>For me, the fundamental flaw in this production is changing the main themes of Dracula - good vs. evil, faith vs. science, chastity vs. pleasure, sanity vs. rationality; into a love story that transcends time.<br/><br/>Coppola has lifted the a minor point in the original story - that of Mina asking for Dracula's executor's to be merciful, and extended it to a doomed love story.<br/><br/>I like my Dracula's bad, lustful, and irredeemable, but Coppola gives us a Dracula to understand. After all, he's not such a bad guy, he only turned away from God because his wife committed suicide.<br/><br/>Personally, I reject the idea that love is not only blind, but amoral. At it's core, Dracula IS a morality tale. We cannot give entirely to lust, for it robs us of our humanity, and makes us the same as not just animals, but the lowest carnivores - blood sucking bats, or wolves howling in the night.<br/><br/>In sum, I rate this as a good Dracula movie, but not a great Dracula movie. The scenes with Harker and Dracula in his castle are among the best in screen literature. The women are beautiful and sexy, but a little too sexy to be virtuous, The men seem somewhat two dimensional, with the exception of Renfield and Dracula himself. The cinematography is excellent, as are the special effects. The music was fine. The sound could have been better, but was certainly adequate. <br/><br/>For me, the problem is an unsupportable point of view, that has changed the story line to a kind of Gothic ""Love Story"", where love is never having to say your sorry, even if I bite you in the neck and steal your soul."

","This movie is surprising because it follows the novel so closely on many points, but at the same time, Coppola deviates entirely from the main focal issue. The movie is more of a tragic love tale for Dracula, trying to regain his lost love Mina. At the same time, Mina is drawn to him, but forced to try and destroy him, and it's all very tragic. This is completely contrived by Coppola; there was never any love interest between Mina and the Count in the novel. This is not some minor plot detail or a little omission from the original; this is creating an entirely different story within the context of the original characters. By itself, the movie is flawed, but it could stand on its own. But I cannot ignore the fact that Coppola changed the characters and their motivations so radically in his movie."
"rparham","8","1","3","12 February 2005"," Not a horror, a tragedy
","With the possible exception of Frankenstein's monster, there isn't a more venerated horror icon than that of Count Dracula. Created by novelist Bram Stoker in the late 1800's, Dracula is popular culture's ultimate icon of the idea of vampirism, the idea of the dead continuing to exist by feeding on the living. The most famous and enduring adaptation of the material is Universal's 1933 version, which starred Bela Lugosi and created the image of Dracula which has become the yardstick by which all versions are measured. In the early 1990's, director Francis Ford Coppolla decided to try his hand at the Count, and while his Bram Stoker's Dracula will most likely never be viewed as the definitive take on the novel, it is to me one of the more successful I have seen.<br/><br/>I must admit that upon first viewing, Bram Stoker's Dracula didn't make much of a impression on me. It was a visually interesting work, that's for sure, but I felt that it was, like many of Coppolla's other ""experiments,"" an example of style over substance. It was only with repeat viewings that I began to see what I was missing the first time: this version of Dracula is much more a story of a tragic character trapped in damnation by his love for his lost bride than a horror story about an unredeemable creature tormenting the living.<br/><br/>Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), working for a London real-estate firm, is dispatched to the wilds of Transylvania, where he is to complete transactions with the mysterious Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) to purchase several properties in London. Once he arrives at his host's home, though, he quickly notices that all is not normal with the Count. The castle he inhabits is practically empty and in a decrepit state; the Count speaks of events of the distant past with the fervor and memory of a man who lived them, and the Count fails to eat, drink, or cast a reflection in a mirror. Upon seeing a picture of Harker's intended bride, Mina Murray (Winona Ryder) in a locket, Dracula believes her to be the reincarnation of his bride, Elisabeta, who took her own life in 1462 believing her husband killed in a battle with Muslim Turks that were invading Transylvania, which caused Dracula to renounce God and enter his current state, that of the walking undead. Dracula imprisons Harker in his castle and then sets out for London with the intention of taking Mina for his own.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mina is living with her friend Lucy Westerna (Sadie Frost) who is busy juggling suitors, eventually deciding on Lord Holmwood (Cary Elwes), but not before Dracula can arrive and begin feeding on Lucy, turning her slowly into his minion. Another of Lucy's potential suitors, Dr. Seward (Richard E. Grant), has summoned an old mentor of his, Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) to assist in the case. It is Van Helsing who determines that Lucy's illness is not a disease, but the result of the feeding of a vampire. While using Lucy to meet his dietary needs, Dracula is trying to forge a relationship with Mina, but his plans are dashed when Harker escapes from his castle and Mina rushes to reunite with him, even as she is realizing that she does have feelings for the Count after all.<br/><br/>In a departure from Stoker's material, screenwriter James V. Hart have transformed the character of Dracula from soulless creature to tragic figure. When the story has no real villain, it becomes difficult to root for the hero's to succeed, which makes Dracula a confusing watch, especially the first time. However, when viewed in the context of a tragedy, it becomes a more engaging story than if you were looking for a more traditional scare-fest.<br/><br/>There are several standout elements in Coppolla's production, but few are more impressive than Gary Oldman's turn as Dracula. He embodies the character's naked ambition to be reunited with his love, mixed with his unending need to feed on the living. Oldman is most impressive as the aged Dracula seen at the beginning of the picture, before he transforms himself into a younger version to attract Mina. In the scenes set in the castle, Oldman commands the screen with his performance and is a treasure to watch.<br/><br/>The film is also visually stunning, boasting some impressive costume design from Eiko Ishioka, giving a very different, more Asian influenced look to the characters in many situations that is a departure from the normal black coat that Dracula is most famous for. Coppolla and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus also utilize color rather boldly in the film instead of painting everything in various shades of gray as previous productions have been apt to do.<br/><br/>This is not to suggest that the film doesn't have weaknesses. Aside from Oldman and Hopkins as the eccentric Van Helsing, the supporting cast is lackluster, most especially Elwes and Reeves. While the change in focus on Dracula from evil villain to tragic hero makes it more palatable for the other characters to not have much of an impact, the wooden performances from the supporting players is a significant failing of the film. Reeves, especially, seems miscast in the role of Harker, seemingly spending all his time focusing on his English accent and not on his performance. The star qualities later on display in films such as Speed and The Matrix are all but missing here. One final standout, though, is Sadie Frost as Lucy. She plays the character with a great deal of energy and playfulness, first as the young débutante searching for a suitor, then as Dracula's minion.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, Bram Stoker's Dracula stands somewhat in the upper-middle of the stack of adaptations of the famous novel, but not quite at the top. The most important fact to remember when watching the film is to not expect a story of terror, but one of pathos."
"fortafananza","10","1","3","20 January 2005"," Oldman makes this version believable!
","This version of Dracula was magnificent. Oldman makes the viewer believe he is so real that at times you can actually feel sorrow for such a character. Ryder did not fit the part in my opinion as I think she lacked maturity and she never really quite matched the passion of Oldman. This movie was not given high enough reviews and Oldman should have received ""Best Actor in a Motion Picture"" award. Reeves was underused here but he gave the part and his character a degree of fear and confusion that the audience could relate to. Overall this movie was the best in a long list of ""Dracula"" movies thus far and definitely demands a 10 from me."
"DrLenera","Null","1","3","11 October 2004"," The best of all Dracula films
","Bram Stoker's novel has inspired many adaptations over the years, and F.W.Murnau, Tod Browning ,Terence Fisher and Werner Herzog all made especially fine versions {and even the 1979 John Badham version was pretty good}. However, this superb film tops them all, with Francis Ford Coppola really pulling out the stops to create a wonderfully stylized work which seems to reference it's fore bearers while topping them for horror, eroticism and sheer cinematic skill.<br/><br/>Despite what some have said this IS the closest cinematic version to the book. Amazing scenes from the novel which have either been absent from previous versions or not done to their full potential are present here, such as Dracula climbing down the wall of his castle, or Dracula giving a baby to his brides to feed on so they spare Harker. A great many other scenes are heightened, for instance the werewolf ravaging Lucy. This was only vaguely suggested in the book, so Coppola and his writer James V. Hart do what every good adapter should do and develop and expand the idea to suit their purpose while still being faithful to the feel and intention of the original. Another example of this approach is the extremely erotic sequence with Harker and Dracula's brides.<br/><br/>Of course the 'eternal love' subplot, which seems partially borrowed from some versions of The Mummy, was not in the book at all and does make Dracula a little bit sympathetic, but kudos to the filmmakers for having an emotionally complex Dracula who is not just a bogeyman.<br/><br/>More importantly, Bram Stoker's Dracula is just so stunningly CINEMATIC. From the costumes to the sets to the cinematography, it is amazing to look at, while Coppola uses almost every possibly cinematic tool at his disposal to enrich his story. He crosscuts feverishly during some sequences, achieving an operatic grandeur while on other occasions he is more subtle, such as the opening battle, done brilliantly in silhouette. No shot is uninteresting, and one thinks of Coppola constantly trying to find the most interesting way to show something. Wolliech Kilar's score is extraordinary, often building levels of sound to striking effect while still delivering a poignant love theme.<br/><br/>Some of the acting is a bit hammy, but that was probably the best way to compete with everything else in the picture. Maybe Christopher Lee and Bel Lugosi were scarier than Gary Oldman, but his performance and characteriation of Dracula is more varied. Anthony Hopkins is simply just having fun as Van Helsing ,while Keanu Reeves, well, as with most things this actor does his performance is often criticised, but he doesn't even TRY to compete with Oldman and Hopkins, and that's just fine, Harker should not be that interesting anyway.<br/><br/>This is a stunning piece of cinema, and it's doubtful there'll ever be a better Dracula movie."
"Swampthing316","Null","1","3","10 October 2004"," This movie is actually pretty good!
","I grow tired of reading all the criticism this movie has received on this site about how this movie isn't really Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br/><br/>If anyone did their research well, you'd know that Bram Stoker based his novel on a real life person named Vlad Tepes.<br/><br/>Bram Stoker visited the real Transylvania which is located in Romania, this city and country as well as the story of Vlad Tepes became the inspiration for Bram Stokers novel ""Dracula""<br/><br/>I will explain who Vlad Tepes was for those of you who do not know who Vlad Tepes was. <br/><br/>Vlad Tepes was a warrior, a very bloodthirsty warrior who was known for his brutal methods of torture, in fact he acquired quite a nickname for himself, Vlad The Impaler, he is also known as Vlad Dracula.<br/><br/>Vlad was imprisoned for a while, he drank the blood of rats while in his cell, when freed he would fight again.<br/><br/>The Turks eventually killed Vlad Tepes in Battle, decapitating him. The head of Vlad Tepes was put on display on a stake. The body of Vlad Tepes disappeared, one theory is that perhaps the Turks burned his body after taking his head, another theory is that his body was buried but stolen, the third theory is what spurned the myth of Count Dracula.<br/><br/>Eventually The Head of Vlad Tepes disappeared as well. To this day neither the head nor the body of Vlad Tepes have been recovered.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola attempted to combine History with Fiction in his version of Dracula. <br/><br/>This film remains true to the book for the most part, however Coppola gives us more background on the Character of Dracula himself, using the theory that Dracula is Vlad Tepes resurrected.<br/><br/>This film took home one academy award if I am not mistaken. Coppola did not disrespect the book at all. The changes Coppola made were in fact for the better not the worst."
"tdelaney1","10","1","3","8 September 2003"," Second Best Dracula
","To tell the truth, I'd rather watch this than any other Dracula and I have many times. But, I just can't bring myself to say it's the best, because I've still gotta give that to Bela Lugosi. Third goes to the bizarre Dracula by Warhol (well, Morrissey, really). I could get effusive about this movie but won't. It is rather true to the Stoker novel with the addition of 'prequel' data about the said source of the vampire legend, Vlad the Staver.<br/><br/>The sets are extravagantly gorgeous, the interiors lavishly opulent and almost smell of decay. Everybody dies over Coppola's Godfather series but or Apocalypse Now. They're great movies but I can't watch any of these again whereas I'd watch Dracula again right now. I think it is the most artistic direction of Coppola's career to date. The casting and acting are superb. I love Gary Oldman and this is my favourite of his. So sensitively portrayed with such a commanding presence.Keanu Reeves has always been a bit stiff but that trait is used as an asset here. Dracula's brides are definitely the stuff of arousal and Dracula's gay side exposure was eloquent with little verbiage. The capper in the acting category was the brilliant touch of Tom Waits as Renfield.<br/><br/>Get comfortable and immerse."

Everything about this film is great from the original soundtrack (that is still being used in film adverts today) to the terrific script and performances. Ten years on and it is still in the top five biggest horror movie hits of all time and I could never imagine I better film based on the book by Bram Stoker."

","For some reason, one can call it a guilty pleasure, one can call it just a rare bird, or whatever, I really liked this film.  I haven't read the book yet, but I've had friends that have read it and watch it and they were very able to enjoy the film, almost as much as I did.  No matter how true the movie is to the book, it dragged me in pretty well.<br/><br/> In brief, Bram Stoker's Dracula is about a Romanian warrior fighting for the Catholic church.  As a lot of stories go, he won the battle.  But a messenger for the enemy sent a false message to the warrior's wife or girlfriend, one of the two.  The note said he'd died from the war and she committed suicide.  He got pretty darn p****d by this and did some weird stuff but it's dark and mysterious.  He lives on through many many years and sets his sights on Victorian London.<br/><br/> The cast is surprisingly good, except one person.  Gary Oldman was perfect for the role of Dracula himself.  Winona Ryder sure surprised me with her performance.  Anthony Hopkins, always good.  But the real surpriser was Tom Waits in his supporting role.  Keanu Reeves was the only real downfall to the movie.  He was only really good in Bill and Ted, and maybe the Matrix. But nevertheless, surprisingly good acting overall.  The movie received three well-deserved Oscars.  Sound Effects, Costume design, and (particularly) make-up.  But Wojciech Kilar's score should've won something, it was unbelievable.<br/><br/> Overall, one of personal favourites.  Some may disagree but I'm sticking to that."

","*Easily* the finest film adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", though it should properly be called ""Francis Ford Coppola's McNally and Florescu's Bram Stoker's Dracula"" for its unmatched amalgam of cinematic style, historical research (the visual evocation of Vlad the Impaler's battlefield triumph is just nonpareil) and Stoker's actual plot. Coppola had the nerve and integrity to combine the historic Dracula (even including his wife's dramatic suicide, a documented event!) with scenes from Stoker that had never been filmed before and some lovely extrapolations (including a revival of the classic ""reincarnation of lost love"" theme) for a fresh, richly beautiful and emotionally powerful version of this much-filmed tale. Sumptuous in every sense of the word."
"Chris-332","10","1","3","3 October 1999"," One of the greatest works of art I have ever seen!
","I am absolutely outraged at some of the reviews I read about this beautiful movie. I can't believe that people said it was boring! How could you think that this movie lacks in story?! And come on, Gary Oldman gave the greatest Dracula performance of any recent vampire movies! He's right up there with Bela Lugosi. The acting in the movie was great! Okay, maybe Keanu Reeves did a bad accent and was miscast. But he was hardly in the movie past the beginning. Winona Ryder was spectacular as Mina. And one thing that I absolutely hated about some reviews was the fact that they say the movie wasn't scary. Of course it wasn't scary, it was a dark romance!The movie was a flat out love story between Dracula and Mina. That's what was so great about the movie. It turned the story of Dracula, a story filled with horror, into a love story.<br/><br/>The way the movie was filmed was stunning. The different ways Frances Ford Coppola directs the movie is astounding! The film truly is a work of art.<br/><br/>
The cast was brilliant. Anthony Hopkins was amazing. Winona Ryder was marvelous. Gary Oldman did such a great performance as the cursed prince, who you actually feel sympathy for as the story goes on. Keanu Reeves was miscast, but he didn't ruin the movie whatsoever.<br/><br/>The story was excellent, absolutely excellent. It was great how the story was divided into three parts: 1) Johnathan Harker goes to Castle Dracula and plunges into madness as he discovers the terrifying secrets of the Count. 2) Dracula comes to visit Mina, and they fall in love. 3) Prof. Van Helsing and the main characters hunt down Dracula by train to stop him before he gets to his castle in Transylvania to grow strong again.<br/><br/>Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the movie is a grand experience in moviemaking. Everyone should go out and rent it, but don't expect to see a horror movie about an evil vampire, but a tragic love story about a cursed prince and his reincarnated princess falling in love during a very dark and horrifying time."
"uruguay-2","10","1","3","7 September 1999"," A TRUE MASTERPIECE!!!
","The best horror movie of the nineties, a masterpiece created by Francis Ford Coppola and J.V.Hart, based on Bram Stoker's homonym novel. This movie has everything: mystery, romance, black humour, sex, beautiful women, death, literature, religion, history, controversy, screams, blood, costumes, special effects,make up, gorgeous places, scary sound track, great and mesmerising epoque reconstruction, social drama and even is a very terrifying one. With excellent performances by Anthony Hopkins, Sadie Frost, a non exaggerated but multifacetic Gary Oldman as the torturated count (where is your oscar?) , and a never more neurotic Winona Ryder in her first ""19 century"" movie as Dracula's victim I think that Ms Ryder is the center of the movie and has the most difficult character, and she play terrible well this innocent and victorian girl, with her charisma and that beautiful brown eyes movement that only she can do, and of course her beautiful dark hair, who remembers me  other heavenly actress of the glory past such as A.Herpurn, N.Wood, O.Hussey and I.Adjani. Also good performances by K.Reeves, C.Elwes and R.E.Grant. Dracula was the first and best big horror gothic production of all the United States filmography history. The others like ""Interview with the vampire"" and even the ""Mommy"" there were not as inspired, romantic, clever  and of course terrifying as this cult movie. It is my favourite movie"
"Movieman-133","10","1","3","20 August 1999"," Beautiful film. The relationship of Dracula is winning.
","After watching the pitiful John carpenter film Vampires,   I find Bran Stoker's Dracula to be extremely artful,  full of amazing acting,  and erotically romantic.  I instantly fell in love with Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder as the two rekindled their love in a daring and rich fashion.   And talk about performances,  Winona Ryder with her dazzling curly long black hair,  her blood and yearning fiery emotion, I was absolutely dazzled. The movie for me took a while to get into to.  But eventually the film gets better with the the possession of the two female ""victems.""  This film even makes blood look lovely and extravagant.  This is one of the few films where I wanted Dracula to win and i saw Hopkins as a nuisance,  a pest if you will.  His performance was good,   but his role alone with Keanu Reeves was very limited.  Keanu wasn't bad as an actor,   but I would much rather see him in the sexy Devil 's Advocate.   The sets ,  costumes,  and make up was magnificient and I feel this must be the greatest Dracula film ever creted.  After teeny bopper films like Beetlejuice,  and Edward Scissorhands,  I never knew Winona could act,  but this proves that she does have potential."

He gave Dracula SUCH a beautiful heart - despite his entrapment in such a life...<br/><br/>I am a fan of Anthony Hopkins as well - but frankly, I thought his performance as Van Helsing was completely POMPOUS and over- done.

","Bram Stoker's Dracula I have seen this movie at least 70 times. The thing that stands out above all is this beautiful/complicated love story that spans centuries.A monster that can change form or become formless. The ""Monster"" is not the Dracula you remember from Lugosi or Christopher Lee. This monster is very powerful, very powerful. The only part of this movie that is hard to believe; is that this creature/man has survived centuries, has ample opportunity and the means to kill everybody in the cast, yet allows himself to be slain and be separated from his lifes love. The first time I saw this movie I wasn't all that impressed, but something about this movie attracted me, and I had to watch again, and again. This is first and foremost a romance. Watch everything, especially the shadows. Dracula got my respect on this one, the only problem is, that now I want to be Dracula. To have power over the beasts and the wind,to be able to cross oceans of time. Congratulations to everybody involved in this film, and thank you very much. And to Mr. Gary Oldman; I don't think Sir that you will ever have a better role. I have been impressed by Gary Oldman in everything I have seen him in. Bravo"

"Alan Grant-1","9","1","3","6 May 2002"," Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder - towering performances!
","Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula in 1992 certainly was a little different from 'normal' vampire films.<br/><br/>I won't give anything away, but as the sub text says ""Love Never Dies"", the movie characterized Dracula as more of a romantic than previously believed. Don't get me wrong - Dracula (Oldman, whose performance as Dracula was possibly the best in cinematic history) was still evil!<br/><br/>But that is precisely why this movie appealed to me - because it was a little different from previous Dracula movies.<br/><br/>The performances by Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder - wow! I don't think I have ever any actor or actress speak with such a brilliant accent: that thick, syrupy Romanian accent dripping off Oldman's tongue - I mean, that guy IS DRACULA! Winona Ryder, one of my favourite actresses also put in a stunning performance as Mina Murray ('Harker' later in the movie). Her English accent and her sensual portrayment of a mortal in love with a monster (Dracula) was wonderful and unforgettable.<br/><br/>The movie itself was of real quality, with other excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins as a slightly 'campy' Van Helsing, and Tow Waits playing the lunatic Renfield very impressively (pretty good for a rock star!).<br/><br/>Whilst this movie may not appeal to fans of gore and sheer violence, it is a nice little diversion. The acting, the costumers, the sets, the special effects and indeed the reasonably-close-to-Stoker's original story makes this movie one of my favourite films of all time.<br/><br/>There should be something in this film for everybody!"

","Francis Ford Coppola and Jim V. Hart deliver in so many ways on this wonderful, heart breaking film. Gary Oldman is the tortured demon, who for once is given a soul. Winona Ryder is the reincarnation of his long lost wife who becomes the object of his all-consuming desire. The production values are absolutely flawless in every category, the acting is all top notch (besides Keanu Reeves, obviously struggling), especially, Oldman, Ryder, Sadie Frost, and Tom Waits. The tragic, crushing ending is one of the most emotional Hollywood has ever created. A success on many different levels, and the most faithful adaptation of Stoker's timeless classic ever made."

"TexMetal4JC","10","1","3","26 July 2001"," Fantastic atmospheric horror
","Of all the mythological scary creatures, none might be as popular as the erotic and malevolent ""vampyr"" especially when Hollywood comes into play (11 vampiric movies come to mind right away: Nosferatu, Dracula, Phantom of the Night, Salem's Lot, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Interview With the Vampire, Night Flier, John Carpenter's Vampires, Blade, Dracula 2000 and Shadow of the Vampire). Hollywood doesn't always make good vampire movies, but they sure do give it the ole college try. And Bram Stoker's Dracula, starring Anthony Hopkins, Winona Rider, Gary Oldman and *shudder* Keanu Reeves, is one of the best.<br/><br/>This version of Dracula tells the story of Prince Vlad Dracul (Oldman), who renounces God after his fiancee commits suicide and drinks her blood as a replacement for holy life. The result is eternal undeath, and the story picks up at the turn of the 19th/20th century. Here it is the same old story. Dracula entertains real estate agent (Reeves) and falls in love with agent's fiancee (Rider). Lots of sex, lots of violence. Dracula is tracked by obsessive doctor with extensive knowledge of diseases of the blood (Hopkins). Lots of Latin, lots of crucifixes, lots of decapitations. Climax between Dracula and the fiancee and his pursuers. End. Credits.<br/><br/>
This is not to undercredit the plot, for it is indeed wonderful. It is excellently-paced and atmospheric to the core - this is definitely one of the best atmospheric horror movies ever. Coppola's directing is superb, using light and shadows to create a fairy-tale unreality at first, and later a brooding malevolence that culminates in the final red-tinted climactic sunset chase. Coppola also uses jerky camera movements and hectic splicing to create first-person views that are both real and dreamlike. And he uses these to perfection. Dracula is a pleasure to watch and soak in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The acting is fine all around. Well, almost all around. Oldman is fantastic as the many incarnations of Dracula, lending the role the vehement evil it requires while adding the melancholic longing necessary to the plot. Hopkins is not disappointing. He is a first-rate actor and provides a first-rate performance as the eccentric yet intelligent Dr. Van Helsing. Rider proves herself capable to stand beside Bette Davis and Ingrid Bergman as one of the greatest actresses of all time. Her portrayal of Mina Murray, the fiancee torn between the suave and handsome Prince Dracula and her true love Jonathan Harker, is heart-wrenching and pity-inducing. Unfortunately that leads to Harker, played by the abominable Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>
Reeves is a hack actor, incapable of playing even the least demanding role (and this one was not very demanding). His stone-faced, surfer-boy acting in the face of the greatest evil he has ever come in contact with is deplorable. The fact that someone dared cast an actor this terrible in such an excellent movie is disturbing (the same should be said for The Devil's Advocate and The Matrix, as well). Reeves is the lone blemish on this movie, and while he doesn't ruin it altogether, his presence on the same set with actors such as Hopkins, Oldman and Rider is ludicrous and unfortunate. The only thing Reeves does well in Bram Stoker's Dracula is narrate Harker's diary, which is not surprising considering how narration is generally monotone anyway.<br/><br/>But -- with the exception of Reeves (and everything good about Dracula must be used in this context) -- ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is not only one of the best vampire movies ever, it is one of the best movies period. Fine acting, perfect directing, interesting plot. And enough violence to make even the generally brainless modern-slasher fans happy.<br/><br/>10/10"
"timefreezer7","10","1","3","8 June 2001"," Masterpiece
","I can 't say much more than I regard it as the perfect movie . It is a beautiful Gothic fairy tale . The success is not much due to the script . The plot based of course to Bram Stoker 's book is not very original . The fact that the monster falls in love with a woman who wants to save him is a well known formula . But the direction is so powerful and the actors gave larger than life , poetic performances who enhanced the power of a story and made the film divine kind of an ancient Greek drama . Sometimes overacting is not necessarily bad .<br/><br/>The direction is very good on the acting side but I believe that the real kudos will have to go to the technicians : first of all the sets and costumes create a convincing victorial London and a haunted / scary Transylvania . The make ups of Dracula are very good . But the gothic cinematography and music score are the ones which steal the show 70 % of the success of the film is due to the atmosphere which photography and music create . Who can forget the beginning sequence ? Who can forget the marriage scene (with the most intense music I 've ever heard) . Who can forget the finale ? Coppola made a splendid job for the supervision and guidance of those professionalistic jobs . The SFX are credible . One of the greatest charms is that you can 't easily designate who is the lead . The center moves continuusly . The movie starts with Jonathan (Keanu Reeves) who visits the tour of Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) . Then the count comes to London and approaches the beautiful Mina (Winona Ryder) . Mina and Dracula are somehow the focus until the middle of the film Dr Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) enters and becomes the lead . The acting is uniformly beautiful and very effective . As I said overacting was the only way to give this story the biblical proportions it deserved . Oldman and Ryder are very good , the underrated Keanu Reeves is quite credible (and stop those silly complaints about the bad accent-he IS half British in reality you know) Hopkins is somehow the scene - stealer because his character is wise and funny . Coppola exploited to maximum the make-up facilities and gave all the sides of the vampire with the transformations : the monster , the aggressive hunter , the eternal being , the human who needs love , the loneliness , and the hopeless life of living in the dark . The good direction is also apparent in some contrived (written) scenes which become chilling and powerful .E.g. when Dracula reads the letter and learns that Mina is gone he cries from anger and orders winds to blow. The winds obey and a room full of candles goes to the dark . In the end we have shots of the sunset which are also chilling . If you like romantic stories then stop reading and see it now It is pure masterpiece .<br/><br/>10 / 10"

The best part of the film as I recall was Sexy Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost)She was at her most humorous when Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) showed her a crucifix. She broke out in a violent failure overture and then just laid back in her coffin as if nothing happend!! Ha ha ha ha ha! Then she sprayed blood on him, remember the pea-soup in The Exorcist? Most of the film was very steady although the segments with Keanu were very uneven, though the dreary and elaborate sets cover up most of the plot holes.Sadie Frost was immaculate as the naughty red-head Lucy Westenra. Remember Richard E. Grant from ""Henry and June"" his portrayal of the troubled Dr. Seward was ample and important.Keanu was a real wimp and portrayed it well. Again, Anthony Hopkins is another eccentric Doctor. And Winona sparkles as Elisabeta/Mina Murray in this masterpiece! And Gary Oldman was  perfect for our favorite bloodsucking malicious Count.Way to go Frank!

","The casting for this film was great.  The movie didn't include all the details of the book but it showed key elements.  I loved Winona Ryder as Mina and Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula.  The scene where the wolves are howling outside of the castle as he says ""the children of the night, oh what beautiful music they make"" and the look in his eyes were very believable. Keanu and Winona also portray their characters very well and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Van Helsing was very entertaining.  The quick shots, ie. when Dracula stalked Lucy, also added to the effect well.  I also thought the backgrounds and sites were perfect.  Hey and the three seducing vampires were not bad either, of course they were not as captivating as Mina.  One of my all time favorite movies."
"VivienLeighsnumber1fan","10","1","3","28 July 2000"," Beautiful Film!
","I love this movie! It makes Shakespeare films look like puke. Not only does it have beautiful cinematography and dialogue. The Cast is great all except Keanu . He really sucked his acting has pointless and his accent wasn't even British. Gary is scary as the vicious but lovestruck Romanian Count. Winona is great as Mina/Elisabeta Dracula's long lost love. Another juicy doctor role for Hopkins. But the best out of all of them is sexy Sadie Frost who gives a splendid performance  as the naughty redhead, Lucy Westenra. It is all great and I love the scary Romanian atmosphere. If you pay attention real closely you can see Dracula's face in the red sky of the Carpathian Mts. How beautiful that is.<br/><br/>10/10. Buy it ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Note: Do not buy the DVD version it is fuzzy and blurry, you are much better off with the VHS."

","Bram Stoker's Dracula is a love story. Coppola's vision of true love, as to reach through the folds of time and space, to reunite two lovers, is an epic retelling of this wonderful story that has had some additional competition in all media forms....Folks, this film won OSCARS. Great soundtrack, great acting from Gary Oldman for capturing that spark within Prince Vlad,  to bridge the gap between monster and man.....<br/><br/>Sure, some of the acting within this tale was stilted, but considering the task to recreate the period piece, and to do it with young actors such as Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves, you have to give Coppola a lot of credit....Set Design, art direction, costuming, special makeup effects, they are all ""cogs"" within the wheel that drives this picture to greatness...<br/><br/>Many films of this genre have come before this one, and many will come after....Regardless, I believe Bram Stoker would appreciate this retelling of his story the best...."

","Coppola's version of Dracula is his least exciting effort. One of numerous adaptations of Bram Stoker's tale, this movie is all over the place. Sometimes a horror movie, sometimes soft porn, and some other times action, this movie has it all, and not in a good way. At the root of it, it is just a silly love story that's way too long.<br/><br/>However, what really stands out is the acting. On one side you've got the always wonderful Oldman and Hopkins, really impressing with their acting range and screen presence. On the other end, you have got Keanu Reeves. Oh, poor Keanu Reeves. Even though he is a great guy in real life, his acting is so very questionable sometimes, and I am not even a hater. I enjoy some of his movies. But in this one he was awful, especially his attempt to reproduce an english accent.<br/><br/>Not a fan of this one."
"utslitt","9","1","4","10 July 2019"," Hauntingly Beautiful Story!
","Everything from the passionate encounters between Ryder and Oldman's characters, Mina and Count, to the eye-catching, enchanting gothic scenery had me absolutely mystified and my eyes glued to the screen.<br/><br/>The story follows somewhat closely in comparison to the novel, giving life to the classic in quite a splendid retelling (if you will). Everyone is familiar with the story, or at least the character, Dracula, so going into this film I'm sure everyone has their own set of expectations. What I didn't expect was to be as intrigued and truly interested as I wound up being. The (just over) two hours of film manages to fly right by as Coppola shows us his take on this beloved classic. Oh, boy, I cannot tell you truly just how much every little detail of this movie from the shadows, to the scene's setting, to the character chemistries and portrayals, and last but definitely not the least, the score of the film pieces together a striking visual that is hard to forget.<br/><br/>As many others stated on here in their reviews, Oldman sets the bar so high, giving the most untouchable performance as Dracula, that even the OG Dracula himself couldn't surpass nor could even wish to replicate it.<br/><br/>Another great portrayal that I feel must be noted is Hopkins' role as Van Helsing. Hopkins' delivers this character to us in such a way that's so ""as a matter of fact"" that you wind up rooting for him as much as you do Dracula himself.<br/><br/>So, why a 9? Why not a 10?<br/><br/>Simply enough: Keanu Reeve's misperformance. His attempt at playing Johnathon Harker is as stiff and underwhelming as it is painful to watch. Watching him play Harker makes me truly wonder what the everloving hell Mina Murray sees in him. Obviously it's not his personality because the character falls about as flat as a cardboard castle on a rainy day. Surely someone as in love with his fiance as Harker claims to be would show a little more expression if things went as south as they did in this film. As big of a Reeves' fan as I am, I wholeheartedly believe this movie could have truly benefited from a different actor as Harker, and then would be without a doubt worth rating a perfect 10."

"herrmanngoldsmithrozsa","10","1","4","27 April 2018"," Bram Stoker's Dracula: ""The Blood is Life""
","What Dario Argento's Suspiria did for witches, and what Nobuhiko Obayashi's House did for haunted houses, Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula does for the titular vampire: create a film as large as the myth itself. Dracula is a character immortalized in pop culture, born out of the 1897 novel by Irish author Bram Stoker and adapted into a string of acclaimed films, including the 1922 German adaptation Nosferatu from German expressionist F.W. Murnau, Tod Browning's 1931 American adaptation that would launch actor Bela Lugosi to icon status with his performance as the Count, and the beloved Hammer Films series of Dracula pictures starting with 1958's Horror of Dracula, starring the marvelous Sir Christopher Lee as the Prince of Darkness. But what set's Coppola's take on the character apart from the previous is how he approaches the material.<br/><br/>1992's Dracula focuses on a different kind of Count, an amalgamation of Stoker's creature of the night and the historical figure of Vlad the Impaler, from which much of vampire myth stems. This Dracula, portrayed with a chilling passion by Gary Oldman, is a man whose wife killed herself believing that he had died in battle. When he finds his beloved, he renounces his Christian faith and soon becomes the vampire we all have come to know. The story from there is your rudimentary take on Bram Stoker's tale. In this case, a lawyer by the name of Johnathan Harker, played by Keanu Reeves, is brought to the home of Count Dracula. Harker is trapped by the Count and, inspired by the likeness between Harker's beloved, Mina, played by Winona Ryder, and his own former wife, Elisabeta. In London, the ancient creature wreaks havoc and sucks the life out of Mina's close companion, Lucy Westenra, portrayed playfully by Sadie Frost. This brings everyone together to battle the vampiric menace, including the iconic Abraham Van Helsing, played with fantastic enthusiasm and dryness by Sir Anthony Hopkins.<br/><br/>To say James V. Hart's script is the heart of the film would be a bit of a disingenuous claim. While Hart crafts a unique version of the tale of Count Dracula, one drenched in eroticism and Gothicism, and one that is very creative in crafting a more complex version of the Count, it simply isn't the sharpest tool in Coppola's shed. It serves in organizing the film and the events of the story well enough, and there are a lot of great bits of character writing, particularly for the character of Dracula, creating a tragic figure that isn't as contrived as what one would expect, and even one whom you can be as charmed and moved by as with Lugosi or Lee. But it does get rather confusing in its narrative progression, but that comes with the more expressionistic approach Coppola sought to take, one favoring extremes to illicit emotional responses rather than tighter writing. The actors and actresses all play their parts with a great level of investment and enthusiasm, safe for two. And yes, it is our two leads. Oldman, Hopkins, Frost, and the rest of the ensemble are all enveloped by the material and sets, they are the characters. But in the case of Ryder and Reeves, they seem like they're sleepwalking through the film. Their performances are a hair subdued, and it doesn't work in favor of the operatic heights everything else is reaching. The score explodes with dark bombast, the lighting burns a fiery red, everyone around them acting like it's a glorified Mario Bava film produced by Hammer, and you have two wooden boards walking amongst it all. Ryder does fair better though, thanks to her chemistry with the young Count and her role in the film's finale, giving her some of her best scenes. And to be fair, Reeves's first scene with Dracula's brides is terribly effective, in part due to his performance. But on the whole, there is no real damage done knowing where the heart of the film truly lies. And that place is in the production itself.<br/><br/>I associate Coppola's Dracula with the work of Argento and Obayashi's cult classic as these are dreamlike films, films that focus on creating a sensation, an emotion, and an impression, rather than tell a truly cohesive tale. And I support these efforts so long as they are committed to creating this dream, or nightmare as in the case of horror. And Coppola doesn't screw around when it comes to crafting this sensation. He guides everyone through the film through a combination of offset requests, such as having actors hanging out to improve their onscreen chemistry, and by emphasizing the surreal, expressionistic qualities of the material, with a parade of references to classic German expressionist films including Nosferatu and Faust, and even a nod to Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1932 horror film Vampyr. Coppola lets the camera linger on such baffling and grotesque imagery, including a bestial creature in two striking scenes with Lucy. He also builds up the presence of Dracula very well, particularly through the use of shadows and striking effects shots, such as Dracula's eyes being superimposed on a shot during Harker's journey to Transylvania. Thomas Sander's production design and Andrew Precht's art direction have been praised to the high heavens, and I'm joining the chorus on this one. If there was ever an apt description, it would be Mario Bava directing a Hammer horror film. The potent saturated colors of films like Blood & Black Lace are combined with the gloriously moody and macabre depictions of London and the Count's castle, as seen in the best of the Hammer library, to yield a powerful effect, a flooding of the senses that elevates the film well above other renditions of the tale. The award-winning costume design by Eiko Ishioka also fits in well, especially considering how it is stylistically reminiscent of costuming for traditional Kabuki theater. Dracula's look, notably the long cape seen early on in film, is a very extravagant piece of work that develops this massive personality and creates a sense of nobility that the Count maintains in his old age. <br/><br/>All of this is captured by the expert lens of Michael Ballhaus, echoing his ability to film striking uses of color in his collaborations with Martin Scorsese such as The Color of Money and Goodfellas. But here, here it is above and beyond the call of duty. Like with the aforementioned Suspiria and House, the extreme saturation and creative lighting schemes are shot so elegantly with wicked Dutch angles and great tracking shots that further escalate the already operatic and unsettling atmosphere born out of the sets and the majority of the performances. The effects work, too, is another aid in creating this larger-than-life atmosphere surrounding the Prince of Darkness. Coppola sought to employ practical effects, with a heavy emphasis on miniatures, front projections, and gruesome makeup effects. This makes the film feel more like the expressionist films Coppola was inspired by, and creates a morbid fantasyland for the story of sensuality and horror to unfold. And then there's that score. Polish composer Wojciech Kilar brings a lush, ballsy gothic score to the film. Percussive, romantic, and explosive, this score completes the atmosphere by drenching the film in shower of robust choral passages, a yearning love theme that reaches for the heavens and carries with it a tinge of Bernard Herrmann's own gothic tendencies, and thunderous themes for the two warring forces of Dracula and the Vampire Hunters led by Van Helsing. It remains supremely effective and doom-laden effort that puts the final nail in the coffin in creating the ultimate opus of visual gothic horror.<br/><br/>This film, in spite of its script sometimes seeming incoherent and the often-bland performance of its romantic leads, is a must see of modern expressionist horror. It explores stylistic excesses that have been the major appeals of German expressionism and Italian horror. It's unashamed focus on creating a glorified tragedy of the Dracula character is on full display through every element of the production in terms of the technical. It's stylized celebration of a character who had, for a time, been relegated to some objectively poor films throughout the mid-century. It will blow your mind with the scale and surreal scope of this masterful horror film from one of the great geniuses of the latter half of the 20th century. Highly recommended for fans of horror, of the Dracula character, of German expressionism, and of Francis Ford Coppola, for this film is just another example of the director's versatility in terms of genre."

","I have no idea why they called this Bram Stoker's Dracula. It has very little to do with Stoker's novel. So if you come to the film like I did, hoping to see an interpretation of the story that's faithful to the original, you'll be very, very sorely disappointed. You're going to have to simply forget all that and try to take the film on its own terms.<br/><br/>It's hard to do so. The acting of Winona Ryder's and Keanu Reeves' acting hits their low points here. I think the problem is that they had to speak using British accents which are unnatural to Americans, and they seem to have been always instructed to speak in heady hush-tones. The Englishmen in the film do fine - even Anthony Hopkins even though he's not using his standard British accent but rather trying (and succeeding) to sound like a Dutchman speaking English. Whatever the case, the Americans' performances here are belabored and flat.<br/><br/>The film is mostly concerned with a timeless love plot line (again, this plot line is entirely absent in Stoker's original). This focus is abundantly evident from the very start of the film and informs all else that happens. In the service of this goal, the film's almost unconcerned with generating horror. What you get is the base amount that you'd expect to derive from any story involving a Count Dracula.<br/><br/>Well, the sets are good. The cinematography is dark, but that's expected given the content. It does move along at a fair pace, so it's not too boring.<br/><br/>But it's just not that memorable."
"beresfordjd","7","1","4","31 August 2012"," Not Stoker's
","This was definitely not Bram Stokers Dracula!! That said it was an enjoyable take on the Dracula story which, quite frankly, has been done to death. Gary Oldman is/was simply the best characterisation of the Count I have ever seen. I doubt he will ever be bettered. In all his incarnations young or old he really nails it. it is so true to the representation in the book as I remember it (if not the actual description it is the total feel of the character). it has been 30-40 years since I last read it and it scared the bejesus out of me! I really did not enjoy Hopkins in this - far too mannered and hammy for me. Keanu Reeves is pretty awful, mainly because of his accent. I think he was cast for box office reasons. I hated Sadie Frost when I first saw this and still don't love her after having seen it about 4 times, but she does grow on you - I guess she was doing as she was told by Coppola. Costumes were superb and the sets were great. There are a lot of flaws in the way the story was told and I would like to see a better, more coherent cut with as much of Gary Oldman as possible - he really should have won an Oscar for his towering performance in my opinion. The way he delivers his line ""The children of the night...."" is worth the cost of admission alone."

","After I have seen this movie, I became a vampire movie fan 12 years ago. Since that day, I have been looking for similar dark, atmospheric experiences. This forced me into an odyssey of bad Vampire movies. Coming back 12 years later to the beginning, made me realize how good this movie actually is. And how hard it is to direct a vampire movie without making it, pathetic, corny or stupid. <br/><br/>This movie isn't free of flaws. Actually, I probably would not rate any other movie with 10 points that has as many flaws as this movie. Some special effects look very trashy (for 1992 it was probably very good). Some scenes look odd, maybe too experimental, and don't fully fit into the rest. Some characters motivations haven't been fully explained, especially the end seems a bit incomplete. <br/><br/>It is all excused by scenes of unbelievable beauty and a dark (and sexy) atmosphere that is unmatched in any other vampire movie. Visually the movie is very experimental, which partly created those very odd scenes, but overall created beautiful and totally unusual scenes. The music is amazingly atmospheric and catchy. After not seeing the film for around 10 years, I was totally impressed when I noticed that the tune was engraved into my brain cells – this rarely happens to me when it comes to soundtracks."

"peegeedee3","10","1","4","12 April 2005"," Gary Oldman
","I totally agree with other commentators. This is acting at it's best. Gary Oldman has always been one of the finest actors that ever graced the cinematic screen, and as Dracul/Prince Vlad he has no peers. Vlad is so sensuous he could make female viewers swoon, this female viewer in any case. This was like looking into another's most precious memories, frame for frame, Gary dominated the view, regardless of who was there with him. I found it hard to take my eyes off of him. Winona was delicate it is true, but the scope of her acting was enhanced by her foil, Gary. She truly seemed to be a woman in thrall of her deepest emotions, unable to escape. Mina honestly made it seem as if the princess' spirit had been re-born in herself, and that the love she felt for her prince had not, and could not ever die. Prince Vlad, soon re-awakened in Mina the spirit of Elisabeta that had been dead for centuries, and recaptured her affections, those that had once belonged only to Johnathan. The interaction made it seem natural, and their love, a natural consequence of their meeting. Even with some events that were so horrible, such as the prince giving the baby to his hags to feed upon, had no effect on diminishing his appeal. As the ancient and wizened Count, there shown out a captivating radiance that was mesmerizing in itself. This happened to be the third or fourth time I watched this film, and yet, it was as if I were watching it for the first time. This film had some of the best characterizations by the actors I have ever seen. Cary Ewels was perfect as Holmwood, the proper English Gentleman. Bill Campbell was very masculine and handsome as the American cowboy, Quincey Morris, loyal friend, and brave combatant to the end. Richard E. Grant was wonderful as the obsessed doctor Seward, trying to help his insane patients with all his might, his gauntness lending a touch of reality to his dedication to his work. Tom Waits, perfectly insane, and thoroughly devoted to his master, as Renfield, 'til he looks Beauty in the face. What a backstabber! Sadie Frost, exactly what you'd expect from the rich débutante aristocratic, Lucy. Prim and proper outwardly, inwardly a wanton slut, aching to be set free. Then there was the maniacal way that Anthony Hopkins portrayed the world famous vampire hunter, Van Helsing!! That was worth the price of the ticket, right there. Driven mad by his quest to destroy the evil Dracula, led him to using such terminology as ""The devil's bitch"", when he was speaking of Lucy to her husband to be, and Morris. Such scenes were hilarious, and well placed. Brilliantly acted out also, by the incomparable Mr. Hopkins. I say, if this was the world Bram Stoker envisioned, or even more, actually lived in, I'd have to say that they must have had one grand Ole lusty time at that!"

The question is about the film, not the book. Seductive, romantic, splendid! Oldman is really good; noble and mysterious, dark and melancholic, romantic and dangerous together. And Winona Ryder as Mina... Oh, my beloved actress, and in this role... so suitable, adorable, the woman whom everyone would desire to... bite, and love forever! A cinematographic masterpiece! I give 10 out of 10, because of the emotion and thrill gave to me, regardless if it is or not enough scary as a horror film (who cares? go and see splatters if so)."

"fezziwig2084","9","1","5","9 June 2014"," A refreshing sort of horror movie
","Originally, the only reason I saw this movie was because it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and was very skeptical about it at first. The movie is a pleasant surprise. There was more of an emphasis on acting and setting than violence and shock value that exists in most horror movies today. Also, the acting itself is very natural and the casting was well done. The best was Oldman as Dracula. He is the creepiest Dracula to date and strikes fear into your heart as you watch this movie. In this movie Dracula apparently has some seductive power and seduces Winona into falling in love with her. Oldman's performance is frightening and pulls you into a trance at the same time. Winona gives a brilliant performance as Mina a young, innocent woman who is engaged to be married to Jonathan who is a solicitor and is traveling to meet Count Dracula to arrange his real estate acquisition. Jonathan soon realizes that Count Dracula is very strange and sees some bizarre and unusual things. Coppola does a very good job directing and I hear that he stays very close with the source material, which would explain Bram Stoker's name on the title. Francis lets the character's draw you in and except for some weird stylized moments seems very authentic to the time period and I felt as if I was living in 1897."

","As a big fan of Bram Stoker's novel, it's no wonder I tend to like this movie a lot. The soundtrack is perfect - absolutely great! Costumes, extraordinary old-fashion-looking special effects and sets - I liked all of it. However, what I particularly love about it is the following: Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of this storyline is a perfect blend of the two opposite literary ideas of vampirism: the Melancholic Vampire (as exemplified by Romantic poets like Byron, Shelley and many more) and the Monstrous Vampire (as exemplified by its creator Stoker and many followers later). Both types of vampires exist until today (although today we are confronted with a third type, namely the harmless, romantic, oh-so-beautiful, socially-accepted High School Vampire). What Coppola did, however, was to combine these two main types into one single ""Dracula"", into a character that is both monstrous, evil, contagious and melancholic, love-stricken, suffering. This perfect blend and encompassing portrayal was only possible because an excellent actor could be won for the role of Dracula. Gary Oldman is impressive and I am sad that he has never got much attention for this role."

"trentpatterson518","10","1","5","24 February 2013"," Best Adaption of Dracula
","Not only is this movie good because it is about the Horror legend of Dracula, but because it stars Gary Oldman as Dracula. He gives Dracula a personality, instead of just being a monster he gives a performance showing him as a Human. This movie is also back up by and excellent cast: Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins and Cary Elwes. This sets and costumes are also very well done, and the special effects are excellent. There are two notable consumes that Gary Oldman changes into: The Werewolf and the Giant Bat which were very creepy. The acting is very good; the only problem I seen was the Keanu Reeves performance seems very stiff and 1 dimensional. Other than that the movie as a whole is very good, and I believe most of the credit should go to Gary Oldman from his performance as Dracula, if it were anyone else I don't know how well the movie would have done."
"ViktorDrake","10","1","5","29 June 2012"," A True Gem
","I absolutely love this film. The visuals are fantastic - there are so many shots in this film that are so intricately put together and incredibly well designed, it's as if every scene could be framed and hung on the wall as art. With the exception of Keanu Reeves (who would give an Ikea wardrobe a run for it's money in the wooden-ness stakes here), the performances are all first rate, with Gary Oldman in particular as the standout (somewhat unsurprisingly). And while the story isn't exactly the same as the original novel, it's great to see chunks of the original script making an appearance on film. It's also great to see vampires portrayed in a different way from either dinner-jacket wearing counts (á la the Hammer movies), rampaging beasts (30 Days Of Night), or agonized, moping teens (as per Twilight). Great movie all round. 10/10"
"minamurray","10","1","5","13 September 2009"," Full of stunningly beautiful and interesting imagery
","Whatever they say in those negative reviews, they are wrong. Wonderful imagery of lush colours, lovely women in lovely fruitcake costumes, gorgeous sets, roses which boom and wither, rich rubyred blood... Special effects are beautiful and actually support the story. Characters - ah, the characters! Yes, Dracula is sadistic massmurderer before turning to a vampire, so the film-makers sympathy plea IS obscene, but Oldman's portrayal is multifaced - he is probably best Dracula, easily outshining much-hyped Christopher Lee. Lucy is turned from virginal, wimpy heroine as nymphomaniac, making poor Stoker to spin in his grave like a mad, but like delicate, doe-eyed Mina (ideally cast Ryder), she is both full of life and feast to the eyes. James V Hart's script is excellent, and the score is a masterpiece in it's own right. The film is great baroque fun, like Hammer Gothic made in modern times... just mistitled. Not for Dracula purists, though, or fans of gore/exploitation crap."
"filipemanuelneto","10","1","6","9 September 2015"," Dracula revisited ... and revalued.
","This film tells the story of Dracula, the notorious vampire created by the imagination of Bram Stoker, based on the life of the king Vlad Tepes of Wallachia. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, James V. Hart has script and the participation of Gary Oldman (Dracula), Winona Rider (Mina Murray and also Elisabeta, first wife of Count), Anthony Hopkins (Van Helsing), Keanu Reeves (Harker, Mine groom) and Monica Bellucci (one of vampire brides of Dracula).<br/><br/>The film seeks to tell the story faithfully Dracula to Stoker's novel, which is obviously one of the main attractions of the film. Indeed, Dracula's character has never been well treated by cinema: we almost only see this character in trash or low-budget films, unless the laudable exceptions of the Bela Lugosi's movie (1931) and some (few) movies with Christopher Lee. In this film, the gloomy atmosphere is stilted for photography and soundtrack, written by Wojciech Kilar. Make-up is also wisely used in various situations, highlighting some of the changes that the Count suffers, assuming grotesque shapes. The sensuality is also present in various scenes and characters. We cannot forget that, thanks to traditional bite in the neck, Dracula is one of the horror characters more directly linked with sexuality and lust.<br/><br/>I don't feel able to make negative comments. The little that could be bad is well compensated by many highly positive characteristics. For all this, that is one of the best vampire movies of recent years and the best film about Dracula in decades. An opportunity to revisit and upgrade the character, giving him again a seriousness that he had lost, and that was very well used by Coppola."
"MidoriFiore","10","1","7","3 February 2010"," The Ultimate Vampire Movie
","This is the ultimate vampire movie. But before i will tell you about all the things i like about it i gonna rant about the things i don't like(HERE ARE SOME SPOILERS BUT I WON'T GIVE AWAY ANY THING IMPORTANT): <br/><br/>First, Keanu Reeves. WTF?!!! What he is doing can hardly be called acting! Come on, show some expression! Coppola should have hired Johnny Depp or Heath Ledger(RIP). Whouldn't what been awesome? Heath Ledger instead of Reeves. Second, the Brides Of Dracula(by the way, if Dracula loves Elisabetha/Mina so much why would he have THREE other wives?! If those were his children i could get it but his BRIDES?). What is the deal with the rape of Keanu Reeves? It seemed blood wasn't the only thing they sucked... :P It just seemed so weird. I saw a musical version of Dracula with a similar scene, but they did it much better.<br/><br/>But what is the good things about this movie? Everything else! Anothny Hopkins, Winona Ryder, Tom Waits and the others a great! But above all others are GARY OLDMAN. This is the role he was born to play. Why he didn't get an Oscar is a mystery to me. I am starting to think the academy is not as great as it seems. Oldman succeeds in making the count both sinister and sympathetic. It's sympathy for the devil.<br/><br/>The love story of the movie is so much better and more complex than the one from recent vampire stories such as Twilight. The music goes perfect with the beautiful images. If you are thinking of watching a vampire movie for the first time out want to show one to your kids for the first time, make it this one."
"sagans_moon","10","1","7","17 January 2010"," Brilliant Fun!
","Most people look at this film all wrong.<br/><br/>Instead of trying to see it as High Art, accept it for what it is: High Camp.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman chews up the scenery with magnificent aplomb - He's such value for money in every scene. Winona is lovely to look at and manages to not bump into the furniture (bless). Sadie Frost tries to ham it up while being overshadowed by the most hideous bridal gown know to creation. Anthony Hopkins, Richard E Grant and Tom Waite seem to be simultaneously confused, embarrassed and over-stimulated by what they're doing. And then, of course, there's Keanu: beautiful to look at and understated as ever. You know, I love this guy. Sure, people say his accent was a bit dodgy and he was miscast, but who cares? He's no worse than Winona (bless) and infinitely more fun.<br/><br/>One to be enjoyed in the spirit it was intended."
"imnotjohncandy","10","1","8","18 June 2014"," Vampirific Masterpiece
","The story takes place in England, the era is 1462 and Prince Vlad/Dracula (played by Gary Oldman) has returned from war, having won the night attack battle against the Turks - to find that his wife committed suicide after a false report of his death. Enraged by this, Vlad renounces the Lord and vows that he will rise from the grave to avenge her. In a fit of rage, he stabs the cross and drinks the blood from it. <br/><br/>Flash forward to 1897, where Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) takes in Dracula as a client to R.M Renfield, who has become insane and was sent to a mental asylum run by Dr. Jack Seward'. Now, here's a little bit of an interesting fact for you - there is a real life condition known as Renfield's Syndrome which is the obsession with drinking blood, such as getting excitement for the taste of it or getting turned on by it.<br/><br/>Jonathan travels to Romania to arrange Vlad's estate acquisition in London, including Carfax Abbey and he meets the count himself, who discovers a picture of Harker's fiancée Mina (Winona Ryder aka Lydia Deitz) and believes her to be a reincarnation of his late wife. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be seduced by his many brides. Damn are those brides sexy as hell.<br/><br/>Dracula takes on the form of a wolf-like creature when he arrives in London, amid a fierce thunderstorm and then uses his hypnotic powers to seduce, entrance and knock up Lucy Westenra who Mina Harker is staying with her while her fiancé Jonathan is over in Transylvania. He then bites her.<br/><br/>Over time, Lucy is slowly being turned into a vampire as indicated by her deteriorating health and her change in behavior, which prompts Mina's old suitors Quincey Morris and Dr Sedward along with her old fiancée Arthur Holmwood to call Dr Abraham Van Helsing, played by Anthony Hopkins. Who recognizes her as a victim of a vampire attack.<br/><br/>One of the many things I love about this particular movie is how much attention it pays to classic vampire lore, as although most vampires are typically seen with the ability to transform into a bat - in classic vampire lore it is indicated that vampires can also turn into wolves, smoke/mist, or sometimes swarms of insects. It's even implied that if an improperly disposed of werewolf were to die, he/she would actually come back as a vampire. Hmmm...that kind of explains why that keeps happening to Eliza and her two 'other halves'.<br/><br/>In the daylight, Drac appears in his more youthful and handsome appearance and charms Mina. And handsome is right. The funny thing was I thought that was Johnny Depp at first before I knew it was Gary Oldman. Even though this movie came out before Johnny Depp became known for his roles in movies like Edward Scissorhands. Young Drac looks quite yummy if I do say so myself.it's not hard to see where Russell Brand stole...oops, I mean 'borrowed' his look from.<br/><br/>They receive word from Jonathan who has escaped from the castle and recovered at a covenant, Mina travels to Transylvania to marry Drac. In his fury, Drac turns Lucy into a vampire. Lucy is killed out of mercy by Dr Abraham Van Helsing, Arthur Holmwood, Dr Sedward, and Quincey Morris the following night.<br/><br/>I am not going to go over the rest of the plot because well this movie is too good for me to spoil, plus everyone has already seen this movie and they are familiar with it already. I mean who isn't familiar with the tale of Dracula? No one? Exactly!<br/><br/>Bram Stoker's Dracula is in my opinion one of the most elegant monster movies i've ever seen, everything about it is just so visually stunning, classy, and well made. I love the sets, I love the props, I love the costumes, I love the musical score, I love the acting and I adore the makeup fx. No wonder this movie won a few Academy Awards, it deserved them for being such a marvelous piece of work.<br/><br/>Sure, some people have made fun of this movie because they thought the acting was too over-the-top and have even made fun of Keanu's 'English accent' , but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it. It's one of my personal favorite vampire movies and always will be.<br/><br/>Last but not least...I ADORE this movie's ending theme 'Love Song For A Vampire' by Annie Lennox, it's so sad but also moving and an overall beautiful piece. The lyrics are very moving as well, well written and full of emotion."

","This movie is beyond bad. The only reason I didn't give it a lower rating was because it did a somewhat decent job of remaining consistent with Stoker's novel. DECENT, at best. The love story made the movie much less intriguing and took away from the main story, which was extremely rushed. Very poor acting (Keanu reeves was abysmal), way over sexualized (the characters are supposed to be God-fearing people that primarily focus on their faith and purity to defeat their foes), and the the writing and general story telling was done terribly. The idea behind the film is perfect and had so much potential, but ultimately fell on its face. If you loved the novel like I did, do not waste your time with this film.

","It's a pretty poor movie but it's faithful to the novel in one sense....it's a pretty poor novel. The first 50 pages of the book are good but then it becomes deadly dull at best and ridiculous at worst. If you want an interesting movie you have to take liberties with the original novel. That's why most Dracula films are totally different. This film, though making changes to try to put some excitement into the story (such as putting the most interesting character, Dracula himself, into it beyond the opening, which doesn't happen in the novel) doesn't manage to create an interesting work. The least said about Reeves and Rider's acting the better.
A more faithful rendition of Stoker's Dracula is possible but it would be even worse than this and that's why it hasn't been done."

","When the fim was released I was around 10 years old.That is why I did not watch it. And I remember at that time special effects in movies weren't great but they were not THAT bad either. I remember the knight rider, back rogers etc and they did have superior effects.
Anyway I just saw the movie.And it is faulty. But I don't judge it very harsh because it has a 'poetic' feeling.
I really liked Gary Oldman , nice style. Keanu Reeves had a terrible British accent. I mean terrible.Winona Ryder spoke as if she was sobbing.
But the story was interesting and decent.
I wish it was better executed.
This movie was not scary at all but it was upsetting. The moment dracula hands the baby to the female vampires or when Lucy holds a child on her way to the tomb. Also some serious plot holes.
Mina seems enchanted by Vlad, she goes out with him, she lets him hold her and kiss her etc and then when the telegraph comes from the fiance she does not really care about, she goes (alone) in Romania to marry him. I mean it does not make sense how se even managed to get there. And why does Jonathan want to marry her so bad? Should not he be recovering from all the trauma he had been through?
At the end why Mina cuts his head off?I mean she embraced the fact that he was evil, she wanted to be with him and he is dying,she pushes the sword deeper to release him. Ok I get it, he was dying anyway, but why cut his head off? If he had any chance for a second chance it was gone..
When mina attacks Van helsing and the other 3 vampire ladies come, van helsing performs a small exorcism and the we see them attacking horses or something,next scene they are lying next to each other and Van Helsing cuts their heads off. When did all these happen?
The movie was absurd but all together it was interesting and memorable. I have watched movies and at the end I could not remember watching them. I don't think I will forget Gary Oldman as Dracula."

Aside from those 2 flaws, the story is melodramatic and sad, the sets look like a an eerie and gloomy converted attic space playground, and all in all the 2 hours will be spent in a nostalgic ""Saturday morning horror sofa time""-feeling.

","Dracula's classic comes to life with Coppola's work, being a story that combines different elements within one, remaining in itself as two main: Romance and terror.<br/><br/>Dracula is a unique film in its design, execution and narrative. Sometimes it feels slow, other times it feels very fast, the scenes stand out for their great practical effects and camera angles, the design of Dracula is especially fantastic and probably one of his best reincarnations on the big screen. The atmosphere of the film stands out for its incredible gothic atmosphere, dark and mysterious, perfectly building the great weight that has the name of Dracula. It contains incredibly disturbing scenes, especially if we take into account the year in which it was released, also taking into account the lustful scenes that pass around the film, you could say that it is a sensationalist film.<br/><br/>However, the film has a strange structure, feels rushed giving big blows in a premeditated way, the characters are not very calm, reaching almost unrealistic extremes, although it must be taken into account that the book also had certainly fantastic and sensational dialogues rather than realistic or logical.<br/><br/>It is a good film of terror and romance, innovative and unique for its effect. However, the fear effect is probably not as strong as it used to be because of the outdated effects, and the romance is quite coarse and snatched. It's a good classic, which comes as a surprise with its incredible level of visual narration, with excellent disturbing scenes and an exciting ending. A classic, no doubt."

","This is a film about how understanding and misunderstanding propagate destiny. Everyone is following their own little role in life imposed upon them by their circumstances. The spirit of their time and their personal position within that era dictate their actions. Mina feels resistance to hanging out with the rich people. Any violation of their sense of reality is labelled as insanity. Harker and Renfield are deemed insane by people that didn't come into contact with Dracula. These rules hold true for everyone except for Dracula, who escaped the bounds of time, and van Helsing, who escaped the expectations of his position in life. Van Helsing is a professor and is expected to be totally rational and scientific and yet he beliefs in the supernatural. He always knew that his knowledge was leading him towards some great work, and here it is. Dracula. Both characters are aware of wisdom beyond ordinary comprehension whereas all the other characters get sucked into events that elude their understanding. Because of how stuck they are in their own time they are simply unable to understand van Helsing. They're prisoners of fate and van Helsing and Dracula creators of it.<br/><br/>How was van Helsing led towards Dracula? How did Dracula become a supernatural force? Those are questions that even van Helsing and Dracula themselves don't understand, which van Helsing admits in the movie. All they can do is play their roles in the context of possessing that knowledge. So it turns out that there is a hierarchy of fate, with 'God' at the top.<br/><br/>Several strong points of this film: Engaging and creative cinematography and art direction. Beautiful sets and costumes. The soundtrack is very fitting and beautiful. Good pacing. Whenever things seem to be getting a bit dull some amazing scene unfolds and draws you right back into the movie. The story feels very solid and fleshed out. That's undoubtably so because of the strong source material on which the film is based.<br/><br/>The acting is great too. Keanu Reeves performance is cool. It feels like he is a bit of an anxious guy just trying to do his job and live a good life. Van Helsing is a typical Dutchman. He is very blunt, intelligent and doesn't care much about being judged by others when he does his thing. Brilliantly portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. But Gary Oldman really steals the show as Dracula. An incalculable dark creature of the night who commands respect and imposes his will, yet a tragic anti-hero all at the same time. Winona Ryder is lovely and she plays the role of being slowly seduced very convincingly.<br/><br/>Why don't I rate this movie a 10? Because if the movie was an hour longer with more character development it would have had the potential to become a classic epic of cinema like Apocalypse Now, The Good the Bad and the Ugly or Matrix Revolutions. Just like in Interview with the Vampire there is still room for more. 9/10."

But your brain recorders everything and stores the data for later.

Her Werewolf action is just totally unexpected, gross but also deeply allegorical: this sort of bestial, wild, blind sex (see also Dante's Howling and again werewolves) can really happen and this total surrender is hot stuff. In that way, this Lucy recalls me the future Lexi Belle (#45)! <br/><br/>Anyway, all the talents are gathered in the movie: wardrobe, sets, music, cast... those old tricks effects, baroque vision and inspired editing really makes a gothic lovestory: Coppola did it once again!"

","The prologue tells us how Dracula came to become a fiendish creature; having gone to fight against the invading Turks he secures an unexpected victory; however escaping Turks have told his beloved wife Elisabeta that he died so she took her own life. His clergy say that she is damned for her actions so he renounces his faith. Four hundred years later young lawyer Jonathan Harker is sent to Transylvania to finalise Dracula's land purchases in London of course nobody realises that he is so old! Dracula sees a photograph of Harker's fiancée, Mina, and notices that she looks just like his Elisabeta. He keeps Harker in Transylvania with his 'brides' while he heads to London. Once there he bites Mina's friend Lucy before befriending Mina. Lucy soon gets ill and her friend and doctor summons his mentor, the great Dr Abraham Van Helsing. Harker manages to escape and summons Mina to Ronania, where they are married, they then return to England but Mina is still in great danger. Ultimately in a bid to save her they all head to Dracula's home where they must battle for her soul.<br/><br/>This is an interesting telling of the Dracula story; as one would expect there are plenty of gory moments and some horrific moments however at its heart it is a romance as Dracula seduces Mina. This manages to be quite erotic at times without slipping over to being sleazy. Gary Oldman dominates proceedings as Dracula and Winona Ryder impresses as Mina. There are also notable performances from Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing and Richard E. Grant as Dr Seward. Then there is Keanu Reeves's performance as Harker, usually I enjoy his performances but here he doesn't feel right; most notably his accent is pretty terrible. The special effects are really good not because they are modern CGI but because they are deliberately old fashioned; this adds to the film's atmosphere. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a horror film that isn't just about the horror."

","Not for me this visually rich and indulgent movie version of the classic story but of course this highly stylised take on it does have its merits and its place in the canon. Coppola creates an atmosphere so thick it may stifle you as it did me. I was riveted for the first 40 odd mins while also feeling queasy and this was every time of the three or four I tried watching it through. I'm intrigued still but I'm not going through that again, it's like sea sickness at best.<br/><br/>I reckon Coppola created a film watching substitute for heroin in making this. Not that I've tried it but I just assume the two experiences must be alike. That's one area he got the novel spot on, in the woozy dreamlike tone and atmosphere of the early chapters. Very impressive technically but I personally just couldn't get beyond this without feeling unwell. Oh well I'll just have to stick to the hilarious Mel Brooks spoof instead."
"mikeydewsnap","9","0","1","24 March 2017"," fantastic film - decent adaptation
","Being a fan of Gothic literature, it often bothers me that these famous stories are so often misrepresented by Hollywood and edited so the only recognisable thing left in them is the monster itself and maybe a certain lead hero. Such examples of this can be found with Dr Frankenstein and his monster, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Dracula and Van Helsing. As a result on certain occasions a film adaptation will come along, claiming to be actually 'accurate' to the novel it's based on. Such is the case with Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 adaptation: Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br/><br/>What's interesting about this adaptation is that while it follows the plot of the book very accurately, it fails to match the tone or the mood of the novel entirely – a feat previously accomplished much better in Hammer's 1958 film version. The Gothic element is almost entirely lost in this adaptation as Coppola seems to be more fixated on adapting the sexual undertones of the book rather than its atmosphere. While the book will simply imply some sexual moments between certain characters, Coppola overtly sexualises certain characters in peculiar ways (this is most notable when looking at the character of Lucy). Yet despite this emphasis on sex, he seems to deliberately leave out many homosexual messages the book contains.<br/><br/>This is my main problem with this film as, despite Gary Oldman delivering a fantastic performance of the infamous character, Dracula here is written as too heterosexual in my opinion. When studying the book, I noted many hints that strongly imply that the Count has a strong sexual attraction to Johnathon – something which would have considered horrifying to the Victorian audience it was written for.<br/><br/>Most of the other casting choices are sheer perfection. Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder, and Richard E. Grant all deliver performances so suited to their novel counterparts, that when I read the book now, I can hear their voices in my mind whenever their respective characters speak. The castings of Keanu Reeves and Saddie Frost as Johnathon and Lucy just do not work however, as one simply cannot do a British accent to save his life, and the other is over acting to a point where you would never believe she would be allowed out of the house in the Victorian England setting. In a modern setting I wouldn't have a problem with her performance, however it tears me out of the believability.<br/><br/>From an artist's perspective of the world, this film truly is spectacular. Visually this film is a treat: choosing to focus on practical effects rather than computers, and making every scene and transition between fascinating to look at. As a film on its own, it is masterfully crafted, and dripping with atmosphere – even it's so over the top that it stretches beyond believability and does not accurately represent that which the book created. For students who wish to watch a film adaptation of the book they're studying, I would redirect them to Jesse Franco's Count Dracula (1970) starring legend Christopher Lee as the title character and Klaus Kinski; who plays the best Renfield ever put to screen. The budget, and art direction may not be up to par with this film, resulting in a much lower quality movie, however it is more successful of matching the tone of the book and follows the actual plot line just as well as this film does."

","** THIS REVIEW COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS. IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED FOR YOU, I SUGGEST WATCHING THE FILM BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU **<br/><br/>Awesome. Down right awesome. Everything was done so good in this film. Before I get into details on why I liked it so much, I must say this is the only movie (in my opinion) that they didn't have some corny Dracula running around. <br/><br/>This film's colonial setting felt extremely appropriate for the film, and no better than KEANU REEVES to play Johnathan. Johnathan, a real estate investor, is sent to the Count's castle to offer property to the Count, that the Count wants to buy. When he gets there, he sees a series of supernatural events happening. Very short events, but assuredly supernatural events. As he is welcomed into the castle by the Count, he sees a horrific amount of things that would make anyone cringe, or more, including the Count's mistresses preparing to feed off of a new born baby. As weird as it sounds, this got me more into the movie. Not just due to weird gore, but because the vampires are always too sissy in other movies. The traditional ""biting on the neck"" stuff just doesn't do it for me. If you need blood, your going to rip someone apart, especially if your some kind of immortal monster. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Johnathan's soon to be wife is back in her home country, awaiting his return, to be wed. That's when Dracula (the Count) takes her from Keanu. He seduces her, using Lust, as she reminds him of his love back before he was a monster, when he was in the war. The acting is very spectacular and the actors do give a genuine early 1800's feeling to the film. The script was also well written and edited. Speaking of actors, Anthony Hopkins also gave a terrific performance of not having a ""too over the top"" Van Helsing. This movie was very down to earth.<br/><br/>As an overall opinion, Bram Stoker's Dracula is the best Dracula/Vampire movie that isn't too over the top, or cheesy. The acting was good, and the characters did a good job of making the film, and story, connect with the viewer. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, hence the 9/10 rating."

","Academy Award winner Francis Ford Coppola digs his Godfather-like hands into a classic novel, and unlike Part III of the saga that made him a household name, this one is easy to follow, and very well written. The casting for this version is exceptional, and like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein two years later, would consist of a dream cast. The acting is top-notch (say what you will about Keanu Reeves' performance, I think he played the role exactly as it was written), the music is beautiful and absolutely hypnotic, with the closing song by Annie Lennox providing the perfect ending to a wonderful, full-blooded movie.<br/><br/>Contains mild spoilers.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman stars as the titular vampire made famous by Bela Lugosi in the 1931 classic Dracula, Winona Ryder stars as Mina, a woman who may be the reincarnation of Dracula's lost love, Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins stars as Doctor Abraham Van Helsing, an eccentric man who has sworn to destroy Dracula at any cost, and Keanu Reeves stars as Jonathan Harker, Mina's fiancée and Dracula's rival. Sadie Frost, Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride), Richard E. Grant, and Billy Campbell (Disney's The Rocketeer) round out the supporting cast. Monica Belluci appears in a minor, but full-bodied, role.<br/><br/>As with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, this photo-play of Stoker's novel takes liberties with the source material, but they serve to enrich the movie rather than harm it. In addition, elements of the novel that are not usually present in motion picture and television versions are retained here in all their cinematic glory.<br/><br/>The Workprint of this film should be officially released, as it probably contains scenes not present in the deleted scenes including the fleshed-out version of the scene where Mina seduces Van Helsing. <br/><br/>There is, however, one question I have. Why were scenes that were in the trailer along with some lines cut from the film before release? At least one scene shed light on Doctor Van Helsing's remark that survives in the final cut: 'Dracul. The foe I have searched all my life.' How and why the good doctor searched for Dracula all his life is never explained, although eagle-eyed viewers will see that Mr. Hopkins, in addition to playing Van Helsing, also doubles as the Priest in the prologue and as the Captain of the Demeter in voice-over. Another deleted scene, originally intercut with Mina and Dracula dancing, shows how Jonathan tried to escape from Dracula's castle. That scene should definitely have not been eliminated from the film, in my opinion. Oh, well. At least, most, if not all of them (for whatever reason), are included on the DVD.<br/><br/>Rated R for vampire violence, and some sexuality."

Anthony Hopkins is good, but he gets carried away too with the role. Winona Ryder was OK, but she was way over dramatic in most of the movie. Now to the maligned Keanu Reeves. It seems in all of the reviews I have read about this movie, he seems to get a bad review. I do not understand why. He and the other actors who played suitors in the movie were probably the least over the top performances. What I am trying to say, they were more natural in their roles. Mr. Reeves is a great actor. Why he is so maligned I do not know. Witness his movies: A Walk In The Clouds, Hardball, Constantine, The Devil's Advocate, Matrix Trilogy, The River's Edge, Tune in Tomorrow and of course John Wick. Oh and I forgot The Gift where he played a great part. Anyway, I thought he was good in this movie with the role he had to play. An enjoyable movie and well made. A true classic."

","Well everybody knows Dracula or at least thinks they do. In reality most film portrayals emphasize the gory blood-lust horror aspects of the character, excluding everything else. These stereo-types probably do for Dracula what ""Jaws"" did for the white shark. Bram Stoker intended his novel to be a Gothic Romance. Although Francis Coppola does not stick faithfully to the novel, his film is probably the closest so far.<br/><br/>The performances are uneven at times, but are overall quite good. Coppola gathered some fine actors together with Gary Oldman in the title role, Oldman gave the role his own touch, especially his Bela Lugosi imitated accent. There were arguments with Coppola over some the star's renditions of Dracula's personality. Oldman won out, the proof is in the final cut, a fantastic performance. Anthony Hopkins plays a rather more eccentric Professor Abraham Van Helsing and plays it as if the part was made for him. Sadie Frost's portrayal of the extroverted Lucy was the best performance of this character Which I have seen to date, While Keanu Reeves came over as a wimpish Jonathan Harker, which by Stoker's description, he was not, No fault of Reeves, but rather a directorial error.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 7 out of 10."

","Every generation needs a Dracula adaptation. Bram Stoker's Dracula in 1992 is one of the most faithful to the original text (or so I hear) and one of the scariest vampire movies ever made. The movie met with polarizing reviews, but I am pretty lenient--I think of this as a good popcorn flick on a Saturday night.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola does his best job in directing, even superior to Apocalypse Now. I'm not saying Dracula is even in the same ballpark as Apocalypse Now, but the way everything is set up and the general look of the films are stellar. As I mentioned earlier, this movie is pretty polarizing, but even the haters must admit how awesome this movie looked. The feel is fantastic, the camera movements are awesome, the set design/costume/make-up are all vibrant, the special effects are sick, the atmosphere is perfect, and the music is haunting. In other words, almost everything in front of the camera is done to precision. Then we get to the other things infant of the camera and most of what's behind it...<br/><br/>The first flaw right off the bat is Keanu Reeves. I do think he is talented and does good performances. But Dracula shows that he cannot play everything well. His accent isn't as bad as people say, but other than that he isn't good as Jonathan Harker. Winona Ryder plays Mina, who is good in some scenes but bad in others. Everybody else is good, with Gary Oldman (of course) shining as Dracula.<br/><br/>While most of the actors are good, the characterizations fall flat and the movie never really seems to find a sense of direction. There never really seems to be a rhyme or reason behind them, or clear motivation. Everything involving the characters is so poorly organized, good thing Coppola is a talented movie maker with a talented cast.<br/><br/>Look: 10/10 Characters: 6/10 I love all of the visuals.

"guisreis","8","0","1","6 December 2015"," A movie of two extremes: great and awful moments
","Coppola's version of the classic novel by Bram Stocker is a good film, but quite irregular. It quickly moves from excellent moments to ridiculous ones, and then to another fantastic scene, and so forth. There is a heterodox filmmaking, which mixes many different styles alternatively. It works properly; however, the problem is that while some scenes are visually astounding (like the Brides of Dracula, the powers of the vampire, the women possessions), there are also many ridiculously kitsch ones. Why the hell Coppola decided to show hemoglobin?! Why showing those Dracula eyes in the sky? That's so cheesy that perhaps even in ""Twilight"" that scene could not be included. On the other hand, off course any of the many fantastic parts of ""Dracula"" is much better than the best moment of the entire ""Twilight"" series. Gary Oldman plays a very frightening and bizarre quasi-androgynous master of evil. Winona Ryder is also charming in the role of Mina. Keanu Reeves is convincing as Jonathan Harker too. Perhaps the great actor who does not do a job as good as we could expect is Anthony Hopkins, whose performance as Van Helsing is tepid."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","0","4","27 October 2015"," Gorgeous..compelling... My favourite version
","Bram Stoker's Dracula, as lovingly retold by the skill and talents of Francis Ford Coppola, is for me the definitive film version of the classic tale. It's so sumptuous, opulent and visually grandiose that it's as if the words themselves have jumped right off the page into living, breathing reality. I can't remember if it was nominated for its production design at all, but it looks just fantastic, from hellish corners of darkest transylvania, to moonlit mountain passes shrouded in fog, to a bustling, lively Victorian London. It's all dazzling, and I haven't even gotten to the actors yet. Gary Oldman is fierce, funny and electrifying as Dracula, my favourite film incarnation. From vicious warrior knight, to gnarled old castle dwelling ghoul (his hairdo is a macabre treat), to youthful, virile young man, he's a wonder to behold. Oldman's calling card is intensity, and he's so implosive here his performance almost combusts, giving the count a sorrowful sympathetic edge, counterpointed by a malicious evil glee. Winona Ryder is breathtaking as Mina Murray, the reincarnation of his lost love from centuries before. Anthony Hopkins blusters through his scenes as a madcap, hyperactive Abraham Van Helsing, Sadie Frost is a seductive standout as Lucy, and Tom Waits a hoot and a half as bug eating whackjob R.M. Renfield. Richard E. Grant, Cary Elwes and Billy Campbell are great as well. The one weak link is Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker, clawing his way through a pathetic British accent. Don't know what they were thinking there lol. The film has an episodic feel, like the ebb and flow of a book's chapters, each new vignette a gorgeous package of mystery, Gothic romance and primal terror. Dracula has so many forms it's a wonder Oldman didn't get exhausted playing him; On top of his three distinct humanistic looks, there's two or three other beastly variations that show off some elaborate makeup effects as well, that transform him but never take away from his transfixing performance. I can't think of any other version of this story that puts forth the sheer atmosphere, spectacle and feeling that this near flawless adaptation strives for, and succeeds with. A milestone in the vampire genre, a showcase of many actors at their finest, and a blood red crown jewel in Gary Oldman's fascinating career."

","After returning home to London, a lawyer finds that his friends' strange behavior is caused by a vampire count looking for a reincarnation of his lost love and sets out with a professional hunter to stop him before it's accomplished<br/><br/>When this one really tried to, it had some really nice stuff to it. The main to it is that there's some wonderful, individual scenes here, starting with a really creepy scene near the beginning where a man walks through a foggy, dark cemetery as he hears voices throughout and out-of-nowhere runs into a black-hooded figure holding a lantern in front of a horse-and-carriage, a prisoner strung-out dealing with the brides in a dried out, decaying pit in the castle basement and the action of being on the ship has a few really neat scenes. The longer ones are also worthwhile, with the main one being the appearance of the brides as it's not enough to have three women appear topless in elegant Gothic gowns but to do it from within a bed-sheet next to their target is impressive and adds a dream-like quality to the film. Also quite good are the scenes depicting the start of the transportation, which is represented with a series of really nice and impressive dream scenes that are at first merely flash cuts of horrific images before giving way to a tense chase through a maze and finally to a hairy creature feasting upon a blood-soaked victim. Even more impressive is that it leads to the scene of the creature's attacks in real life, watching an unknown beast claw through several guards in violent manner through its POV is really fun and enjoyable. The other part here that works are the fun, action-packed bookends to the film, with the opening on the battlefield and the castle-ground finale is pretty good while the ending assault at the castle itself is a highlight. These here are the film's good points as this here was pretty problematic at times. The biggest thing to this is the length, which is pretty big at two hours. This one is really epic yet only feels that way for reasons that have no bearing on why it should be. The first is that scenes tend to drag on forever that could've been shortened since they take too long to make their point. The most obvious one here is the first scene in the castle which manages to occupy twenty-minutes of time as Dracula rattles off several speeches about being in love that lasts for quite a longer time than it should have. As well, this one works for the fighting in the tavern as it's quite boring watching Dracula hurl people into furniture before making ominous threats. The other factor which brings out the length is the seeming multitude of scenes that are so useless they never needed to be there, like the two walking around London trying to win her over with his charms, the scenes of the two girls joking around at the party and the scene of them in the garden talking about the wedding. These are mostly responsible for the film's length here. The last flaw is the dearth of blood and gore amongst the body count, with this one really should've had more for as big as it is but it's not as detrimental as the other flaws. Otherwise, this one wasn't all that bad and had some good points to it.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, Brief Nudity and a sex scene."

","The movie was quite overblown in comparison to the book. The book Dracula was never popular but when the idea of vampires became in vogue there was a resurgence of interest. The book in no way is linked to Vlad Tepes. Stoker used the word Dracula as the characters name because of its basic meaning and not because of a person. This is a point that shows that Coppola did very little research on the book and went along with previously believed ideas that have been debunked.<br/><br/>The choice of actors to portray the parts was not a good one. Winona Rider is a good actress but didn't fit the part of Mina in my opinion. Both Oldman and Hopkins over-act throughout the whole movie. It is an opulent and stunning rendition but too much for my liking and why I gave it a lower vote. It isn't enough to make it a good movie if the title is Bram Stoker's Dracula since it is Coppola's idea of the character Stoker created and is only partly true to the book. I realize it is only an adaptation but if one is calling it Bram Stoker's then the idea of Vlad the Impaler should have been left out of the story line.<br/><br/>The character in the book is Hungarian and of a warrior class and not Romanian at all. At the time the book was written, Transylvania was not part of Romania. Another thing that comes up is garlic but it was garlands of garlic flowers, not cloves that are mentioned in the book and should have been used in the movie. I did see some flowers around Lucy's neck but also the cloves which isn't correct.<br/><br/>In the book a box comes for Van Helsing containing garlic flowers which he uses to protect Lucy. ""Garlic flowers are essentially the flowering seeds of the garlic plant. They emerge at the tip of the garlic's above-ground stem."" In the case of the book, it was white garlic flowers and not the cloves. The essence of the story does have to be gleaned since the book is written in epistolary style and why it wasn't that popular. The overall movie is fine but not the best vampire movie compared to many others. Anne Rice was mentioned but there were books well before hers where vampires burst into flame. It became a popular idea used by many writers just not in this story, although it has been used in some theatrical versions of the book.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like a fanciful version of Stoker's story this would be the one."

The sets were so amazing to look at, especially when it came to Dracula's castle! Well deserved Oscars! I adored Dracula's brides here, the way they behaved, presented themselves, the manner in which they spoke, all of these aspects were cranked up in their portrayal of these three evil wives of Dracula, especially in the scene where all 3 seduce Jonathan Harker. I'm glad that scene was in the film, it really shows and reveals the true nature of Dracula's wives, and I just love the way they handled themselves, with fangs, a smile, the elaborate costumes, and with a very very sensual manner, which is an integral point of his wives. There were a few awkward moments as far as acting, but overall, very good! I also really embraced the beginning story of how Dracula became himself by losing his beloved. And the ending was actually and surprisingly very touching, and I'm glad it was, nice to see Dracula have some real emotions and feel love like a human.

","First, I have to admit that i haven's read Bram Stoker's novel so i won't be comparing this excellent movie to it. I can't say to such extend it's faithful to it. But from what i've seen in other reviews, there is one basic difference. The love story between the count and Mina/Elizabetha. I think that when you film a book, you have to stay faithful to it as much as possible. But, god, am i glad F. Coppola didn't in this aspect? I think Dracula presented with more human, romantic and vulnerable side along with the face of a dark, cruel, merciless killer is great decision. It makes his character much deeper and i like it that way far better than the one-dimensional blood- thirsty psychopath many of the viewers prefer and weirdly dismiss Coppola's Dracula as ""dull"".<br/><br/>Winona Ryder was perfect as his lost and then rediscovered true love. She was much more then damsel in distress here as some of you have tried putting it. Mina is a great character and very well developed in my opinion. And the scenes between her and Dracula (fantastic performance of Gary Oldman) were so passionate, so raw and heartbreaking...Enough said about that. :)<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins's performance was classy and brilliant as always and no matter how much i loved Gary and Winona's characters, the movie wouldn't be the same if the role of the infamous vampire hunter had been given to somebody else.<br/><br/>So my final conclusion is: intricate,dark,eccentric, sensual, epic, romantic. A great horror movie and a great love story. A film you should not miss. 10/10."

","Think of the monstrous ego of the vampire. He thinks himself so important that he is willing to live forever, even under the dreary conditions imposed by his condition. Avoiding the sun, sleeping in coffins, feared by all, he nurses his resentments. In ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" the new film by Francis Ford Coppola, the vampire shakes his fist at heaven and vows to wait forever for the return of the woman he loves. It does not occur to him that after the first two or three centuries he might not seem all that attractive to her.<br/><br/>The film is inspired by the original Bram Stoker novel, although the author's name is in the title for another reason (Another studio owns the rights to plain ""Dracula""). It begins, as it should, with the tragic story of Vlad the Impaler, who went off to fight the Crusades and returned to find that his beloved wife, hearing he was dead, had killed herself. And not just killed herself, but hurled herself from a parapet to a stony doom far below, in one of the many spectacular shots which are the best part of this movie.<br/><br/>Vlad cannot see the justice in his fate. He has marched all the way to the Holy Land on God's business, only to have God play this sort of a trick on him. (Vlad is apparently not a student of the Book of Job.) He embraces Satan and vampirism, and the action moves forward to the late Victorian Age, when mankind is first beginning to embrace the gizmos (phonographs, cameras, the telegraph, motion pictures) that will dispel the silence of the nights through which he has waited fearfully for centuries.<br/><br/>Coppola's plot, from a screenplay by James V. Hart, exists precisely between London, where this modern age is just dawning, and Transylvania, which still sleeps unhealthily in the past. We meet a young attorney (Keanu Reeves) who has been asked to journey out to Dracula's castle to arrange certain real estate transactions. The previous man who was sent on this mission ran into some sort of difficulties . . . health or something . . . all rather vague . . .<br/><br/>Reeves' carriage, driven by a man whose hands are claws, hurtles at the edges of precipices until he is finally discharged in the darkness to be met and taken to Dracula's castle. There, everything is more or less as we expect it, only much more so. Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) waits here as he has for centuries for the return of his dead bride, and when he sees a photograph of Reeves' fiancée, Mina Murray (Winona Ryder), he knows his wait has been rewarded at last. She lives again.<br/><br/>Back in London, we meet other principals, including the fearless vampire killer Prof. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), and Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), a free spirit who has three suitors and is Mina's best friend. When Dracula appears in town, Van Helsing's antenna start to quiver. And the movie descends into an orgy of visual decadence, in which what people do is not nearly as degraded as how they look while they do it.<br/><br/>Coppola directs with all the stops out, and the actors perform as if afraid they will not be audible in the other theaters of the multiplex. The sets are grand opera run riot - Gothic extravaganza intercut with the Victorian London of gaslights and fogbound streets, rogues in top hats and bad girls in bustiers. Keanu Reeves, as a serious young man of the future, hardly knows what he's up against with Count Dracula, and neither do we, since Dracula cheerfully changes form - from an ancient wreck to a presentable young man to a cat and a bat and a wolf.<br/><br/>Vampire movies, which run in the face of all scientific logic, are always heavily laden with pseudo-science. Hopkins lectures learnedly on the nosferatu, yet himself seems capable of teleportation and other tricks not in the physics books. And the Ryder character finds herself falling under the terrible spell of the vampire's need. Many women are flattered when a man says he has been waiting all of his life for them. But if he has been waiting four centuries? The one thing the movie lacks is headlong narrative energy and coherence. There is no story we can follow well enough to care about.<br/><br/>There is a chronology of events, as the characters travel back and forth from London to Transylvania, and rendezvous in bedrooms and graveyards. But Coppola seems more concerned with spectacle and set-pieces than with storytelling; the movie is particularly operatic in the way it prefers climaxes to continuity.<br/><br/>Faced with narrative confusions and dead ends (why does Dracula want to buy those London properties in such specific locations?), I enjoyed the movie simply for the way it looked and felt. Production designers Dante Ferreti and Thomas Sanders have outdone themselves. The cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus, gets into the spirit so completely be always seems to light with shadows.<br/><br/>Oldman and Ryder and Hopkins pant with eagerness. The movie is an exercise in feverish excess, and for that if for little else, I enjoyed it. by .rogerebert"
"mark.waltz","9","0","3","1 December 2013"," Stunningly different with an occasional element of silliness that prevents the film from total excellence.
","The legend of Vlad the Impaler (Gary Oldman) has taken over the Dracula legend through books and documentaries, and the premise of this movie has added an interest to the real-life historical character who once fought on the side of the Catholic Church in a manner so evil and brutal that the vampire legend sprang out of his existence. Here, he is fighting the Turks for the church, impaling them on sticks, although the film cuts out the visual of him dining while surrounded by the bodies, some of whom were still alive and in agony as they lingered up in the air gasping their last breaths. The suicide of his fiancée (Winona Ryder) upon falsely learning of his death makes the church damn her, and he in turn, damns the church. He's turned instantly into a blood-drinking demon who will rise up from death after sending a sword into a cross, and all of a sudden, 500 years later, looks like a combination of Benjamin Franklin and the aging Salieri from ""Amadeus"", albeit with a very bad hair style.<br/><br/>When Keanu Reeves, as a British attorney, makes plans to head to the Carpathian Mountains to meet an aging count (actually you-know-who), he bids a sweet farewell to his worried fiancée (also Winona Ryder), and after heading through the spookiest looking mountain range, ends up in the company of this aging ghoul. Oldman continues to play the part, taking every ounce of it seriously, which makes it easier to forgive the laughable wig he is wearing. (Mel Brooks would playfully spoof that with Leslie Nielsen as the Count in ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It""; A Broadway musical version which was a huge flop also kept it in. Go figure.) Odd things happen, especially with the Count's three wives who seem to be literally connected at the hip in one scene, and a gruesome gift for them from the count himself may upset some viewers. Between Oldman's wig and Reeves' over the top attempt at serious acting, this sequence is both intriguing and sometimes too silly to be believed, especially a shot of Oldman literally shooting up straight as he comes out of a coffin.<br/><br/>When Dracula finally arrives in London, he's taken on a third look, and here, he's a dashing aristocrat who can walk about during the day without fear of the sun. This has upset some ""Dracula"" connoisseurs, but for plot purposes, it works, at least in this version. The chemistry between Oldman and Ryder as they connect in some sort of time travel re-meeting is undeniable. But a vampire is a vampire is a vampire, and with ethics or not, the blood lust means evil, and evil must be destroyed. That brings in Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing, sort of silly at first, but never imbecilic. Sadie Frost is a delightful flirt as Ryder's pal Lucy, but that wedding dress that she must wear seems more appropriate for some gay priest drag ball.<br/><br/>Overall, however, this is a satisfying update of the story, and you certainly feel that they've captured each era of the story wonderfully. As directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this is one of the first modern films with this high definition look, and the photographers went overtime to get everything just perfect. Shadows of Dracula moving in other directions than the actual character on screen make an unforgettable visual, and as Dracula is able to turn himself into whatever image he likes (including a werewolf at one point), makes his legend more intriguing. A tense finale has everybody back in the Carpathian Mountains and is followed by a beautiful Annie Lennox song that wraps everything up neatly. While not perfect by any means, it is still a film I can watch over and over again, finding new elements in it which I missed in previous viewings. If only the lack of subtleties in this had been a lesson to learn and had influenced Coppola in his very busy ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" remake, that film wouldn't have been as disappointing. You can't repeat the same formula twice and necessarily succeed."
"nexton","6","0","1","1 July 2013"," Bram Stoker would be disappointed if he's alive!!
","I read the novel and finished it about one week and the next day i watched the movie.<br/><br/>Well, i just want to say that if i watched the movie without read the novel first i would have given a better rating maybe 8.<br/><br/>Its not a bad movie but very unfaithful and disrespect the novel. I am disappointed with this flicks because the title is the straightforward ""BRAM STOKER'S Dracula"". Bram himself should be regretting himself to wrote the good book and abused after his rest in the grave.<br/><br/>***SPOILER***WARNING!!!<br/><br/>1. The film clearly abused the novel with humanizing the Dracula, how the Dracula feels regret when turning Mina into vampire and all other scenes. While in the novel Dracula is something a curse creature, unforgiven, cursed by God, inhumane, heartless, deserves to die, and has a childish frame of mind.<br/><br/>2. In the novel there are no explanations about the Dracula having lovers or wives or whatever. So turning Mina into some kind of reincarnation of the passed Dracula lover is something ridiculous. And the film even worse makes the love relations between Dracula and Mina into the main topics is disgusting.<br/><br/>3. The novel shows the very deep modesty relation between Mina and Jonathan, they very loves each other, very respecting each other, they feel their emotions each other, they show their grieves deeply if one another has the problems, and it's affecting us...REALLY. But the film turns Mina into an unfaithful wife with her desire to the Dracula and they even almost make love in Mina's desire...MY GOSH!!!!<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDS!!<br/><br/>Finally, i understand if a film isn't exactly words by words with the novel version, but if they changed the main topic and the heart of the novel which is the beast Dracula in to something humane Dracula, thats too much. And turning the faithful and religious Mina into the unfaithful Mina in the film, thats just unthinkable.<br/><br/>For the casual beholders and yet to read the book, it better to watch the film first then read the book so you wont be upset. Even better After watch the film and don;t do the reading, it will make you feel cheated.<br/><br/>But for the beholders that have no desire to read the book, its the best for them, the film could be a fun thing. The pesky beholder (just like me) is the one that after read the book then watched the movie. Just sad thing."

"Hey_Sweden","8","0","2","13 May 2012"," Big budget production has a lot going for it.
","This incredibly lavish film, courtesy of screenwriter James V. Hart and director Francis Ford Coppola, is a very respectful adaptation of the classic Bram Stoker novel, so much so that Coppola gave ownership of the story to the author in the film's official title. It's got all of the wonderful sets, costumes, and special effects that money can buy, and has plenty of dark and stormy atmosphere. The set pieces are memorable, as are the various guises for the immortal blood sucker, who in this instance is connected to the real life historical figure of Vlad the Impaler, who loses his beloved wife Elisabeta upon her receipt of (false) news of his death, and furiously renounces God, living on through the centuries as an undead fiend who decides to put down roots in late 19th century London. He fixates upon the lovely Mina (Winona Ryder), the spitting image of his long lost love, but an intrepid team of vampire hunters are determined to prevent his reign of terror from enduring. Right from the start, it's amazing just how much pizazz Coppola and company put into this thing, and he and his cast & crew deliver entertainment on a grand scale; the ambiance is just overwhelming, and the film not only succeeds on a visceral level (with generous doses of the red stuff) but an emotional level as well. It's important to note that Dracula is not an entirely unsympathetic figure, and his scenes with both Mina and Lucy (Sadie Frost) have the appropriately sensual, seductive quality. The most potent ingredient in the mix is the phenomenal performance of Gary Oldman, one of the great actors of his generation who is never less than completely convincing, whether he's being forlorn or just plain creepy. Anthony Hopkins (as Van Helsing), who actually generates most of the laughs, Richard E. Grant (as Dr. Seward), Cary Elwes (as Arthur Holmwood), and Bill Campbell (as Quincey Morris, the Texan) comprise a wonderful supporting cast, and singer Tom Waits is most amusingly cast as the inimitable Renfield; Keanu Reeves gives the role of Jonathan Harker an honest effort, but he's simply miscast and tends to stick out too much. Be sure to look out for the likes of Monica Bellucci and Jay Robinson in small parts. A first rate technical crew includes cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, production designer Thomas Sanders, costume designer Eiko Ishioka, and composer Wojciech Kilar, who immerse us in this vivid environment totally and completely; the period recreation is as good as one could want it. The film gets particularly rousing towards the end with the journey to Dracula's castle through snowy weather, although the final battle is over rather quickly. Nevertheless, this is great fun, and can rightfully take its place among other cinematic interpretations of the Dracula tale. Eight out of 10."

","This was alright! Scary in some places, boring in others, add some humor, (both intentional and unintentional) and you get a pretty good movie. Gary Oldman plays a fine Dracula here, sneering and slurping at every turn, he's pretty awesome, and Wynona Ryder as Mina plays a fine counterfoil. From there, it gets mighty curious, with Anthony Hopkins playing the most insane Van Helsing ever (he gets all the best lines, and is almost as insane as Renfield it appears) and yes, Keanu Reeves as Harker. Ahhhh man, Reeves killed me with that one. You haven't seen acting until you see the surfer boy deer caught in headlights pose Reeves always looks when he delivers his lines. So as you can see, something for everyone!"
"oneguyrambling","7","0","1","27 January 2012"," This Dracula might look Spectacula - but it isn't an all time genre classic.
","Francis Ford Coppola and co pulled out all the stops in this faithful retelling of Bram Stoker's classic masterpiece about undead luvin', everything short of hiring quality young actors that is The short version of the plot goes like this: When a renowned Transylvanian warrior finds that his much adored wife has taken her own life while he was out and about crusading on the Lord's behalf, Count Dracula he renounces the Church and gives himself eternal life just because of the passion of his speech! The now undead through sheer force of will Count potters about his vast castle, eating babies, growing and training minions and influencing beings of lesser intellect to do his bidding. Gee that was worth hanging around hundreds of years for <br/><br/>This all changes when his personal banker Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) makes his wooden way across the seas to pay the Count a visit in order to have some documents signed and sealed. Unfortunately the last personal banker to make the journey went nuts shortly after and was confined to an asylum to eat bugs and alternately mutter under his breath and scream for his master at the top of his lungs, but still – a promotion is a promotion, even if it takes you away from your loved ones.<br/><br/>It is after the Count spies a pic of Harker's missus awaiting his return in jolly old London town that the situation changes. The Count firmly believes that Mina (Winona Ryder) is not only the spitting image of his once beloved dead some hundreds of years, but is in fact her. And he in turn is destined to be with her.<br/><br/>So only after packing numerous ornate and resplendent outfits does the Count wend his way across seas to be with his destiny.<br/><br/>Now I might've forgotten to mention but the Count is actually somewhat of a vampire – not sure if he willed that part or if it was merely a side-effect. Nonetheless this grants him special powers, including but not limited to: shape-changing (bat/dog/wolfman/mist etc), brainwashing, fire-breathing and apparently flight.<br/><br/>Once in the UK all Drac wants to do is hook up with his laydee, but once his presence is made clear it seems that all the women he comes into contact with are more than willing to disrobe for him, often in public, while all the guys want to ram a stake through his heart and cut off his head.<br/><br/>(Coincidentally enough the same effect Matthew McConaughey has on the general public.) The star of Dracula is the production design. The sets are opulent and immaculate with the finest detail being obvious and Gothic themes and vivid creative imagery on display in almost every scene. The background is awash with vivid and lustrous colour and the costuming similarly intricate.<br/><br/>On top of this there are numerous eye-catching elements including the oft-parodied and copied mismatched shadows, the overlapping backgrounds which morph into other scenes or subtly show subliminal imagery, and the special effects for the time are quite impressive.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman fully vamps it up as the Count in his various incarnations, giving nothing less than 110% at all times in a role that demands cartoonish elements. Anthony Hopkins is no less over the top as Van Helsing, only perhaps in a role that doesn't require the same degree of hamminess. But both Reeves and Ryder find ways to average out the film with their wooden performances and stilted delivery. I do not pretend to know a great deal about the nuances of acting or the techniques required to lend credibility to a period drama – I just know that whatever it is they didn't have it.<br/><br/>Blood is a recurring motif in Dracula, for obvious reasons, and as the film progresses toward the inevitable much is shed, though in a Sleepy Hollow so violent that it can't be real way.<br/><br/>In the 90s when I was far more impressionable it was all so easy to be swept up in the orgy of imagery and visual flourishes that Dracula provides, and to blindly see the over the top performances from Hopkins and Oldman as masterworks. Now 20 years on these things aren't quite so impressive, Dracula remains a very good film with an awful lot to look at and admire, but it is by no means an all time classic.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Immaculate production and lush designs make Dracula spectacula, but still can't create the quintessential Vampire movie."

","I am watching the movie as i write this, and i am 42 minutes in, and so far nothing i have seen was in the book. For example, the book mentions Mina seeing a 'dark figure' with glowing red eyes behind Lucy, not a werewolf raping her on a bench. another is that Dracula was not in love with Mina, nor do i remember the book mentioning anything about Dracuala's love affairs. The three Vampires came to Jonathan while he was sleeping, or so they thought, but retreated their attack after seeing his crucifix, nowhere in the book does it mention him having an orgy with the three. What ever happened to walking into Dracula in his sleep and seeing a young Man. i understand that the directors can put all the details, because it would lead to a 5 hours movie, but they could've at least made it more accurate. some anal details, like when Lucy is telling Mina about the three men it was in a letter, not a personal encounter between the two. All in all it is not a bad movie, but in terms of the book it is nothing like it."

","So, last night I re-watched Bram Stokers Dracula (1992) and I have to say: ""This movie was pretty bad"", Casting was OK at best. I think Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was the best casted role. For a movie that was made in 1992 the special effects were sub-par for its time. Throughout watching this, I kept asking myself did the director even read this book? Yes, it was and still is the most accurate depiction of the book to date, but I still feel as this movie just does not live up to book (cliché I know). <br/><br/>There are some really good things in this movie that were done really well but I just feel like the bad acting, horrible effects, and the constant sounds in the background took away from the story.<br/><br/>Please someone remake this movie, someone with a large budget and a better vision of this tale. This is the Vampire story to rule all vampire movies. I think Francis Ford Coppola had his heart in the right place when he set out to make this movie, but Dracula is not a horror story as much as it is a romance."
"Vivekmaru45","10","0","2","26 October 2010"," Highly paced and special-effects extravaganza of Bram Stoker's eternal classic.
","The brilliant Mr. F.F Coppola (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now) directs an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br/><br/>He wisely sets the pace as a good one omitting unnecessary dialogues and scenes. He decides to dazzle our eyes by providing a visual feast of special effects.<br/><br/>The casting is good too. With veteran actors like Gary Oldman as Count Dracula and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing what could go possibly go wrong? Also as a bonus: the handsome Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker and the sexy Winona Ryder as Mina and Elisabeta.<br/><br/>Now for the story. It is a love story as well as a horror story.<br/><br/>In 1462, Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman), a member of the Order of the Dragon, returns from a victory against the Turks to find his wife Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) had committed suicide after hearing false reports of his death. Enraged at the notion of his wife being eternally damned as a suicide, Dracula desecrates his chapel and renounces God, declaring that he will rise from the grave to avenge Elisabeta with all the powers of darkness.<br/><br/>In 1897, law clerk Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) takes the Transylvanian Count Dracula over as a client from his colleague R.M. Renfield (Tom Waits), who has gone insane. Jonathan travels to Transylvania to arrange the formalities of Dracula's real estate acquisition in London, including Carfax Abbey. Jonathan meets Dracula, a wrinkled, pale old man (Oldman) inhabiting a bizarre castle. During the signing of the papers, the Count discovers a picture of Harker's fiancée, Mina (Ryder), and is astonished to find that she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be seduced by his brides (Monica Bellucci, Michaela Bercu, and Florina Kendrick) and sails to England with boxes of his native soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey. His arrival is foretold by the ravings of Renfield, now an inmate in Dr. Jack Seward's (Richard E. Grant) neighboring lunatic asylum.<br/><br/>In London, Dracula emerges as a werewolf-like creature amid a fierce thunderstorm and hypnotically seduces, then rapes and bites, Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), with whom Mina is staying while Jonathan is in Transylvania. Lucy's deteriorating health and behavioral changes prompts Lucy's former love-interests Quincey Morris (Billy Campbell) and Dr. Seward, along with her fiancée, Arthur Holmwood (Cary Elwes), to summon Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), who during a blood transfusion recognizes Lucy as the victim of a vampire. Dracula, now young and handsome, meets and charms Mina. However, when Mina gets word from Jonathan, who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent, she travels to Hungary to marry him. In his heartbroken fury, Dracula transforms Lucy into a vampire. Van Helsing, Holmwood, Seward, and Morris kill Lucy to stop her undead suffering, and save her from eternal damnation.<br/><br/>As Jonathan and Mina return to London, Jonathan and Van Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey, where they destroy the Count's boxes of soil. Dracula enters the asylum, where he kills Renfield for warning Mina of his presence, and visits Mina, who is staying in Seward's quarters while the others hunt Dracula. Dracula confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina's friends, but a confused and angry Mina admits that she still loves him and now remembers her old life as Elisabeta. At her insistence, Dracula begins to transform her into a vampire. The vampire hunters burst into the bedroom, with Dracula claiming Mina as his bride before escaping by changing into thousands of rats. As Mina begins changing the same way Lucy had, Van Helsing hypnotizes her and learns via her connection with Dracula that he is sailing home in his last remaining box. The Hunters depart for the port of Varna to intercept him, but Dracula reads Mina's mind and evades them. The Hunters split up, with Van Helsing and Mina traveling to the Borgo Pass and the Castle, while the others try to stop the Gypsies transporting the Count.<br/><br/>At night, Van Helsing and Mina are approached by Dracula's brides. They frighten Mina at first, but she gives into their chanting and attempts to seduce Van Helsing. Before Mina can feed on his blood he places a communion wafer upon her forehead, leaving a mark. He proceeds to surround them with a ring of fire to protect them from the brides. In the morning, he infiltrates the castle and decapitates them. As sunset approaches, Dracula's carriage appears on the horizon, pursued by the hunters, and arrives at the castle. A fight between the hunters and gypsies ensues and at sunset Dracula bursts from his coffin. Harker slits his throat while a wounded Morris stabs him in the heart. As Dracula staggers, Mina rushes to his defense. Holmwood tries to attack but Van Helsing and Harker allow her to retreat with the Count, turning instead to Morris, who dies surrounded by his friends.<br/><br/>In the same chapel where he renounced God centuries earlier, Dracula lies dying, now in an ancient demonic form. He asks Mina to give him peace, by stabbing the sword through his heart. They share a final kiss, as the candles adorning the chapel miraculously light in God's presence, and the hole in the cross heals itself. Mina shoves the knife through his heart. The mark on her forehead disappears as Dracula's curse is lifted, as well as Elisabeta's soul. She then decapitates him and gazes up at the fresco of Vlad and Elisabeta ascending to Heaven together. Mina is then finally free.<br/><br/>Actors of note: Gary Oldman is OUTSTANDING as the portrayal of Dracula. Along with Winona Ryder playing both as Elisabeta and Mina. Anothony Hopkins needs no introduction and he plays his part effectively. Keanu Reeves is disappointing as he has a small part in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall a must have for your DVD collection. Overall 10/10 a visual Masterpiece."

","It must say that I was impressed with the tagline in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" one that will grab your attention and will keep you at the edge of your seat like any love story that includes tragedy and horror mixed in for good measure. <br/><br/>This movie breaks all barriers that stands in the way as we embark on viewing two lovers able to overcome their betrayals no matter how big the consequences are. And unlike some other vampire movies that are not worth mentioning, this one delivers what it promises as it adapts to one of the greatest vampire novels of all time and one novel that you can absorb to while reading it.<br/><br/>Set in Romania in 1462, nobleman Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman) has come home from his victory over the Ottoman Turks to be the victim of bad news as word comes on that his wife Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) has took her own life and her soul can't seek redemption because of her Catholic faith. Angrily, Vlad condemns God, and gains an obsession out of drinking blood that penetrates through the walls. <br/><br/>A few centuries later we go back to 1897, London, a young British gentleman named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) is set to marry his young lover Mina Murray (Ryder) until words come out that his accomplice Mr. Renfield (Tom Waits) has gone loony and has an appetite of eating insects. Harker leaves merry old England to Transylvania to take over Renfield's place as Vlad's client who has a profound interest in real-estate. Dracula has taken interest in the Carfax Abbey and asks Harker for help in the acquisition. Harker feels uncomfortable with the Count and the whole situation as his anxiety goes from bad to worst. But everything was taken care of smoothly and successfully and Harker couldn't have been more relieved. <br/><br/>However, Dracula sees a portrait of Mina and believes that she is the incarnate of his lover and now his focus is on taking her back. In return, Vlad makes Jonathan pay by falling prey to the four lady vampires who almost drink out all his blood but keeps him alive due to food shortage. Vlad goes off to London and changes his appearance from a decaying old man to a young man like he was three centuries ago. <br/><br/>In London, while passing the time away, Mina awaits for her lover to come back as she spends some quality time with her friend Lucy Westerna (Sadie Frost).Lucy is quite popular with the men as three guys have proposed to her a Texan (Bill Campbell), a physician (Richard E. Grant) and a nobleman (Cary Elwes) whom she chose. When Dracula makes his way to London, he sexually lures Lucy into his trap and takes her off to the living dead. Seeing her strange behavior, that Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is called on to see what's ailing her. Vlad thinks now's the time to get his hands on Mina manipulating her into forgetting about Jonathan. <br/><br/>I for one thought the Van Helsing character was the most interesting one because he cries out for some much needed humor in this pretty melancholy story which lack in charisma or passion that makes this movie kind of dry at times. The lines given to Vlad and Mina feel like a love scene from ""Dark Shadows"" and the relationship between them seem held back. And they never fully reconcile. Once she hears that Jonathan is still alive, they go off to Hungary to get married and coldly gives him a Dear John letter. Who's the bad guy here? The evil blood-sucking vampire or the deceitful ex-lover?<br/><br/>I must admit some of the dramatic scenes helped improve Stoker's novel. Mina as Elisabeth's incarnate was very effective to the movie and was handled with care and her being romantically involved with Jonathan and it should have kept that story that way instead of killing them off in the realms of English propriety. <br/><br/>Reeves and Ryder were really good in their roles, I'm saddened to say the Oldman fails to impress as the Impaler himself. Sure he looks good for the role, but the lines given to him were pedestrian and not very provocative. Ryder is also guilty in this conviction, but not as bad as Oldman. <br/><br/>It's a shame the leads lacked the panache given to the characters, but the supporting players were beyond excellent and it was them who held my interest throughout, though they weren't given much to do. Which is sad because to me this story was like a car that is nice to look at on the outside, but doesn't have that steam to carry on through."
"zardoz-13","10","0","5","2 August 2010"," A Different Kind of Dracula
","Acclaimed Oscar winning film director Francis Ford Coppola sinks his cinematic fangs into the most notorious vampire in film and literature and delivers his own unique interpretation of the wicked bloodsucker with his romantic horror chiller ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" Basically, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" qualifies as possibly the fourth remake of Todd Browning's ""Dracula"" (1931) with Bela Lugosi. Nevertheless, despite some exhibitions of fidelity to the source material, Coppola and scenarist James V. Hart set out to differentiate themselves from the previous incarnations with elements that aren't quite identical. Dracula emerges as a protagonist only vaguely related to his cinematic predecessors. Indeed, the legendary vampire appears initially as on elderly gentleman with white hair. Unlike virtually every vampire since ""Nosferatu,"" Coppola's ""Dracula"" can stroll the streets during the daylight hours without the sun cremating him into a pile of ashes. However, he lacks his full vampire powers. Originally, the silent film ""Nosferatu"" altered the vampire's ability to thrive during the day. Mind you, in his celebrated novel, Stoker allowed his infamous bloodsucker to circulate during the daylight hours. The Dracula in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" never turns into a bat, but he does transform himself into a hideous rodent, a horny gorilla, and he has powers that go beyond his physical presence. For example, Dracula wanders around in the foreground, while in the background his shadow assumes a life of its own in contradiction to everything that his physical presence does. Although he dresses in dinner attire, this Dracula wears a number of different outfits.<br/><br/>Interestingly, neither Coppola nor Hart seek to scare the hell out of their audience. Instead, they deliberately set out to make a romantic vampire movie filled with surprises, revelations, and a little soft-core nudity. An interesting prologue charts the history of the protagonist and how he lost his wife and then turned his back against God. The historical context that Coppola and Hart establish for their Dracula is unlike any other ""Dracula."" The performances are uniformly excellent, with Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins taking top honors. Hopkins is incredible as the vampire slayer Van Helsing and he displays a sense of humor that is refreshing. For a change, the usually stiff Keanu Reeves seems credible as a stuffy Englishman. Wynona Ryder, who brought the screenplay to Coppola after she bailed out of the director's ""Godfather 3,"" is suitably cast as the beautiful object of Count Dracula's desire. As Mina, she is the reincarnation of his dead wife. You can separate the different Dracula movies by their fidelity to the source material by the use of the two characters Mina and Lucy. Some Dracula movies reverse the two, so that Mina becomes the weak girl who dies first, but Coppola and Hart stick with Stoker in this instance.The lush visual imagery is perfectly entrancing, and Coppola experiments with lots of ideas. According to the commentary track, Coppola sought to do something different from the earlier ""Dracula"" movies, and he succeeds in large part with his version that makes Gary Oldman's Count Dracula look nothing like Bela Lugosi's bloodsucker or Christopher Lee's fangster. Atmospheric, intellectual, and sexually risqué, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is a bat of a different leather."
"aernest","7","0","1","22 November 2009"," Visually stunning, some liberties with the plot
","First off, this film is great to look at. I loved the way Coppola used what he called ""naive"" special effects - very simple, but effective. The costumes are sheer genius, with their Kabuki overtones, thanks to the Japanese costume designer. Oldman (whose pedestrian appearance should have worked against him) gives a virtuoso (if not true to the novel) performance. But yeah...then there's Keanu Reeves. What was Coppola thinking? He ruins every scene in which he opens his mouth. Winona Ryder is not much better in the accent department, but she's a better actor than Reeves, so she gets away with it. Have to admit, I don't always get Sir Anthony's take on Van Helsing...getting seduced by Mina? No, I don't think so. I'm a big fan of the book, but this is one of my favorite movie versions. The other? The little-seen Louis Jordan version."

","This film is incredible. The special effects, the story, and the attention to detail stay loyal to Stoker's novel (which I have read) with a little leeway for the director to work. The acting is top-notch, featuring Keanu Reeves who does his best with the British accent and Gary Oldman, who gives in my opinion the performance of the century. His portrayal of Dracula is horrifying, heartbreaking and suave all at the same time (think of a mix between James Bond, Hannibal Lector and an actual bat). Ford Coppola's direction is astounding, which does not surprise due to the magic of the Godfather. If you do not mind blood, you like action, romance or a good monster movie, see this. You will be disappointed only that the movie ended."
"gommetje","10","0","3","19 July 2009"," Most romantic story ever
","Even though many people tend to say that romeo and Juliette is the most romantic story ever told, I strongly disagree. I belief that Bram Stokers Dracula deserves that title. Where Romeo and Juliet let their love die with them, Count Vlad Dracula lets his love transcend death and defy god (whome obviously means almost everything to him). Time, space, death nothing has an impact on his love for his wife. It's there, everlasting, and there is nothing he won't do to be with her. You can only imagine what it must be like to love somebody like that. Or to be loved like that. Dracula is in my opinion not a story about vampires, it's not a horror story. It's a story about love, the vampires are just a means to an end. And this movie really nails that. Gary Oldman is without a doubt the best Dracula that I have ever encountered on screen. He really made the part his own. At times I felt I could actually see the pain over his loss in his eyes. I loved it from the beginning until the end."
"eamon-hennedy","10","0","2","16 June 2009"," Masterful piece of horror and romance.
","There is a moment, around thirty minutes from the end of Francis Ford Coppola's film, when Mina Harker drinks from the blood of Count Dracula, an act that in the space of the same moment mixes brazen sexuality with blood curdling horror for the Count soon turns into a hideous bat like creature before dissolving into a pile of rats. It's a scene that encapsulates the romance, the beauty and the ugliness that is the cornerstone of the movie. The first thing I should really say about this film is how much I love it. To me it is a superb slice of film-making from a man who, at this point in his career and twenty years after the masterpiece that put him on the map, was not regarded as highly as he once was, at least in terms of the films he was currently making at that time. Certainly his previous film, prior to this, was the third installment of his Godfather series and that was a film that divided just about everybody based on whether or not it was a necessary film, to plot developments right through to the casting of the actress playing Al Pacino's daughter.<br/><br/>Admittedly, and I will be the first one to say so, there are some issues here to be had. Some of the performances, or more so, the accents of some of the performers leave a lot to be desired, and yes, I'm looking at you Keanu Reeves. There are moments where one does expect an utterance of the line ""it's the Count dude"", and while, thankfully, we never get that, it says a lot about said accent that no matter how many times one watches this film, you can't help but expect it. The whole aura of the film also feels over the top at times, the bloodletting, the overt sexuality (Sadie Frost's performance as Lucy comes across as a walking orgasm for most of the film, but this only seems to add to the fun considering the character comes across as nymphomaniac even before she becomes a vampire) and Anthony Hopkins' accent, but it works in the spirit of the film. What does work triumphantly well are the performances of the two leads. Gary Oldman, probably one of the best actors working today in film, and Winona Ryder, forever and always my favourite actress despite her inability, supposedly, to pay for her shopping, sell the love story of Dracula and Mina in a way that is almost heartbreaking beyond belief, with furtive glances, genuinely moving chemistry without resorting to playing it in a ""I want to remove your clothes now"" sort of a way, is backed by sensitive direction from Coppola and a terrific music score that never intrudes and tells the audience how to feel, instead complimenting the emotion on screen. Winona's performance is beautiful and understated, as always, selling you her character's feelings and thoughts without overplaying it, whilst Oldman, seemingly, until the Christopher Nolan Batman films came along, forever and always playing villains, actually gives us a villain, although not as black and white as that description would suggest, that you want to root for, a man who has fallen into darkness based on an emotional loss that in turn places all those he comes into contact with into a similar place but who eventually fulfils a redemption in those haunting, final moments.<br/><br/>The best performance could be held over for Francis Ford Coppola, here working as a director for hire in a studio film, but making it, as he always has done, through his own personal eyes. Instead of relying on modern technology available at the time, Coppola utilized old fashioned filming techniques and technology that was only available during the birth of cinema to present his vision of the tale. Old fashioned models, in camera trickery with not even a whiff of CGI. It's refreshing and original and brilliant. Of course not everyone will speak of the film in the same breath as the Corelone's or the Kurtz's but to me this is a crowning achievement, despite some bad judgments (again, I look to you Keanu Reeves), from a director who we all have to thank for the cinema that we have. At the time of writing (2009), horror has become a genre that is creatively dying, with torture porn and remakes of films that really shouldn't be remade when they were already good to begin with. Here we have an adaptation of a piece of work that has been made so many times, yet here it feels fresh and original, almost new. How many horror films, or even better yet, romantic films, can say that in this day and age?"
"krazieandwickedal","10","0","3","31 May 2009"," A huge bloody, gory, sex filled, death fest and I loved every second
","I've always loved Dracula. I always found the story to be quite intuitive and intriguing. It's depiction of love at all costs, even in the nature of murder, lust, and insanity, is brilliant. It's a grand story and no film depicts the story better than this. 1992's Dracula is beyond amazing. They took the basic story of romance that Bram Stoker wrote a hundred years before and made it ten times better with the inclusion of the over-dramatization of many scenes. While that word could be insulting and even make a film sound horrid, this actually works well with the Dracula story and gives it a more Gothic, evil taste. The acting is superb, including Gary Oldman's performance. Who knew that the Batman commissioner could act like this!? He plays Dracula well and gives him a more deadly and beautiful taste unlike I've ever seen before. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Van Helsing. A character of dark humor and devilish wisdom has never been played better. The script is amazing and it's hard to believe that this great update of the 1800's classic was going to go straight to TV before Winona Ryder picked it up. And Francis Ford Coppola does a great job of directing this feature. It seems like everything he touches turns to gold. Dracula, is no exception. It truly captures the emotions of lust, ecstasy, sex, blood, death, and love like no movie ever has before, and for that, it is simply brilliant. One of the best adaptations I've ever seen. I highly recommend this film. If you love horror, romance, or gore, you find this film to be a homage to the original Dracula and you will love this film as much as me. I give it a 10 out of 10."
"Eumenides_0","9","0","2","4 May 2009"," The Best Dracula Movie Ever
","Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula is the most ambitious and technically-impressive adaptation of Bram Stoker's much adapted novel. It's the only version I know which keeps the epistolary structure of the novel: letters, diaries, logs, newspaper clips, etc. form the complex narrative of the movie. I think it's also the one that tries to put so much of the novel's original plot in the movie.<br/><br/>Visually, it's a feast. Particularly impressive are Eiko Ishioka's Oscar-winning costume design, which produced medieval armors unlike any I ever saw and the Count's long, brilliant costumes. The make-up also has an important place in the movie, considering they had to age a 34-year-old Gary Oldman into a vampire who seemed older than time itself. It's the best horror make-up after The Exorcist's. The art direction turned Victorian London and Transylvania into sinister places: whether it be a derelict castle full of rooms, or a madhouse, the sets are always heavy with dread.<br/><br/>And then there's the cinematography. As much as the novel was about different types of writing, this is a movie about different styles of film-making. We have scenes that evoke old German Expressionist movies; we have scenes that seem like they were shot with an old 19th-century camera. Coppola uses the iris in/iris out technique, and even uses fast-motion, and makes it look good.<br/><br/>Much has been said about Keanu Reeves' poor acting, but what does that matter when he's barely in the movie, and when the movie focuses mostly on Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins? Bram Stoker's Dracula is not just a great adaptation of the novel, it's a great movie, and arguably the last great movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola."

"HelloTexas11","9","0","2","24 November 2008"," fantastic film-making; best Dracula ever
","This version of 'Dracula' is I feel the best ever. It really manages to present on the big screen what Bram Stoker's original vision probably was. It is scary, funny, erotic, lush and memorable. Francis Ford Coppola pulls out every cinematic trick in the book it seems to bring to life the story of a centuries old vampire who moves to London in search of fresh victims and a woman who apparently is the reincarnation of his long-dead wife. The movie is richly detailed and at the same time, fast-paced. The opening sequence, where Prince Vlad renounces God and attacks a sacred altar with his sword, is like a hammer-blow to the chest and sets the tone for the rest of the film. There is not a wasted second of celluloid in 'Dracula;' it is superbly written and visually striking, even breathtaking at times. Gary Oldman makes a moody and menacing Dracula, who adopts various guises throughout the movie. I suppose if I have one criticism, it is Oldman's speaking voice- he adopts an accent so thick he hardly seems to be speaking English at times, and making it even more difficult to understand is the halting, half-choked manner in which he speaks. I would say at least a third of his dialogue is virtually unintelligible. The surprise is that the movie does not really suffer because of this. It only adds to the overall atmosphere. Professor Van Helsing is portrayed with great gusto and playfulness by Anthony Hopkins, who's interpretation of the famous character suggests he's been driven about half-crazy by his pursuit of Dracula. Winona Ryder makes a fetching Mina/Elisabeta, and Keanu Reeves registers well as her fiancé and later husband Jonathan Harker, who's hair understandably turns grey after his experiences in Dracula's castle. The energy level of all the performances suggests the actors involved took great pleasure in their roles and the production. Coppola's direction is assured, almost never hitting a false note though he takes a great many risks. He has fun with the Dracula legend but never slips over the line into parody. You will find yourself smiling, laughing, and then cowering in your seat within the span of a few moments. We even get Dracula's trademark line, his equivalent of, ""Bond... James Bond."" Which of course is, ""I never drink... wine."" This is an absolutely awesome movie."
"lingcod9","Null","0","1","24 October 2008"," Faithful to novel ??!!
","After reading all the objections about this movie compared to Bram Stoker's book it must be remembered his novel was a compilation from many different sources anyway. Stoker created Dracula from a hodgepodge of ideas, superstitions, and history, so there's nothing really sacred about it. Except his name. All the other Dracula films lack a convincing reason for his existence. A false message was actually sent of Vlad death by the Turks. I thought it reasonable how this was worked into the film, and gives us a foundation for why Dracula is the way he is. Where else could he have come from? Like the chicken or the egg dilemma, there has to be a 'first' vampire or source, and this is as good as any. <br/><br/>I still love the 1931 movie and think Bella is great . . .but the range of characters Oldham portrays in this version is much closer than other actors have done. In my opinion. What deviations and differences there are between movie and book are simply because of the two mediums. I commented to a friend how War of the Worlds would have been so much better if it followed the book.<br/><br/>Silly me. How could it? Observations and impressions are hard to impossible, capturing on film. Each have their merits, and both can be enjoyed, if we keep that in mind.

The film is based on the Victorian horror novel written by Bram Stoker in 1897 about the vampire Dracula, who travels from Transylvania to London to find the young woman Mina Murray, who is the double image of the love he lost centuries earlier. I do have an interest in the occult and vampires are starting to be my favorite monsters. And I love movies starring one of my favorite actresses Winona Ryder (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and Little Women).<br/><br/>I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the whole film, Bram Stoker's Dracula is the most faithful film adaptation of the book and I am thinking of reading the novel.

","Francis Ford Coppola's interpretation of Bram Stoker's legendary tale seems to have plenty of mixed reviews. Many Dracula purists loathe it, some love it's romance and stunning images. Even though I've read the novel, I'm no purist, and I thoroughly enjoyed this take on the novel. In Coppola's hands Dracula is a tortured soul who searches for his lost love across oceans of time. Gary Oldman's Dracula is completely different from Bela Lugosi in that he is sexy! I actually think Oldman's performance and the ramped-up eroticism is closer to what Bram Stoker actually intended in his novel. I remember all these wonderful descriptions of draining veins, re-birth, flesh and women who seem more turned on than scared by the vampire. It's an incredibly visual film, and great to look at. Winona Ryder is little and sweet as Mina, the re-incarnation of Dracula's beloved Elisabeta. Keanu Reeves is just a terrible actor and I wonder why he was cast as Jonathon Harker. He was a teen heart-throb at the time, so maybe it was to broaden the appeal of the movie? Maybe Coppola wanted a conventional pretty-boy who acts like a piece of wood juxtaposed with the interesting Oldman, to make him doubly attractive? I was a little bit disappointed with Anthony Hopkin's performance, by his standards he's not really memorable. Overall, I liked the film a lot."

In the book, Renfield, the random man in the insane asylum, is just that -- a random man in an insane asylum. He was not, as the movie tried to show, a clerk similar to Harker. Also, there was no such romantic triangle amongst Mina, Harker, and Dracula. The vampire actually went after Mina almost randomly, as he did with all of his victims.<br/><br/>With all of these superfluous connections, the movie felt completely bogged down to me.

","Coppola's transcription of what I consider the best horror novel has been praised and lauded for the excessive lush and comfort spilled in it's design and production. The only highlight is how writer Hart could absorb Stoker's ramble on sexual hysteria, repression and explosion finally, in which Coppola translates into seductive movements, innuendos and deep colors. What is, indeed, as sexually inducing as sucking the blood, the life out of others? But in the development of action, the only highlight is Oldman's interpretation, cold, slow and chilling. The make-up dangles in between baroque and exaggerated. Reeves and Ryder make for a couple with no flair, nor joint or individually. All of the attention put in the design and context should have been taken into Dracula's internal conflicts, the spawn that grinds his eternal years of solitude, the fear and hate towards mankind, his reclusion, his eternal love.<br/><br/>Besides that, they forgot the chapter of the book where peasants attack and clog Dracula's mansion, and claim for vengeance on the death of young women.<br/><br/>Stoker's flair is sadly removed, at least much of it."

"gftbiloxi","6","0","1","3 February 2008"," Darkly Beautiful--But Sterile and Uninvolving
","Although it received generally positive reviews and proved a world-wide box office success, public reaction to the 1992 BRAM STOKER'S Dracula was significantly mixed. To a certain extent, this reaction was based on the film's slightly abstract, extremely operatic visual style--a style which seemed to overpower not only the actors but the actual story itself.<br/><br/>Dracula has a spectacular visual design that mixes ideas about Victorian style with flamboyant color and ornate, border-line baroque detail that seems more suited to an Asian stage play than a film presumably set in 1890s England. The cinematography follows suit, using double and triple exposures, shared screen photography, and intense washes of color. The result is tremendously moody, both beautiful and ominous. It is also extremely distracting, and it tends to bury the actors, script, and story to such an extent that the film becomes less about these elements than about the mood and look inflicted upon them.<br/><br/>At the time it was released, Dracula was touted as the first film version that was faithful to the 1897 novel by Bram Stoker--but this is not true, as any one who has read the novel can attest. The film has been deeply influenced by the Bela Lugosi film, the Boris Karloff THE MUMMY, and the ""Hammer Horror"" vampire films of the 1960s; it explains how Dracula became a vampire, incorporates dollops of reincarnation, includes a very romantic subplot, and presents us with an ultimately sexy vampire--none of which exist in Stoker's novel. There is also considerable sex, and while this is a part of the original novel its power there arises from its subtextual nature; here it is rendered explicit and consequently seems less powerful than merely commonplace. Even so, the core story of Dracula's transition from Transylvannia to England, his attacks on Lucy and Mina, and his ultimate destruction remains much the same.<br/><br/>The casting of Gary Oldman as Dracula and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was a stroke of genius, but sad to say the production-heavy nature of the film doesn't allow them the necessary wiggle-room necessary to create the memorable performances you would expect. Winona Ryder seems very aptly cast as Mina, as does Sadie Frost as Lucy--but the script undercuts both, leaving Mina slightly chilly and Lucy excessively overheated. As for the eternally wooden Keanu Reeves, he lives up to his reputation as one of the least interesting actors of the era, delivering a memorably wooden performance.<br/><br/>When the film delivers, it does so memorably, with the scene in which Lucy is laid to rest for once and all a case in point. But overall, BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is not Bram Stoker, nor is it actually a cohesive variation: it simply a particularly exotic vision forced upon a story that doesn't support it. The result is often darkly beautiful, but it is also somewhat sterile and surprisingly uninvolving. The recent ""special edition"" DVD actually undercuts the visual interest of the film; the transfer is dreadful. If you are a fan who wants the bonus material--and there is a goodly amount of it--you would do best to hang onto your original DVD copy as well, for it will be superior to the version offered here.<br/><br/>GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

Dracula looked in the beginning like a fag with 2 white giant balls in his head,an unnecessary long red jacket dragging across the floor,some kind of chronological contradiction between his arriving and his wild attack against Lucy, an interesting tribute to the original ""Nosferatu""(the shadows over the wall showing his over nailed hands),a dislikeable scene almost gay with Jonathan shaving and cutting out his neck,the look of Vlad:a wolf,a black vampire,a white bat(when Van Helsing was blessing his ""cave"" Dracoul seemed to attack Van Helsing and allies,but Mina was his target instead),the long hair and mustaches like the original Vlad Tepes Dracoul never used in the classical movies of our childhood, Vlad could walk even in the daylight(Mina was met of that way),Bellucci dissolved the Jonathan's cross to suck him(but Dracula could not with another),yet with mistakes and ""goofs"" this movie is better than all the made until now,though if those wrong stuffs hadn't been the result may have been superior,but it's a good flick in all the cases."
"soulthiefs","10","0","1","10 November 2006"," It's not Bram Stoker's Dracula, but it's still a good film
","OK, it's been mentioned a lot in the comments, but if you are watching the film instead of reading the book then don't. The book is completely different, as are the characters. Stoker spends a long time building up suspense, as you read the book you find yourself scared to read on in case Dracula comes out. Dracula wasn't waiting for his lover, and Mina was devoted to Jonathon, she was also a strong intelligent woman. Lucy was a sweet girl not a sex addict. If you however ignore the title this in my opinion is a great film. There are some great performances, Dracula and Van Hellsing are brilliant. It also has great scenery and I like the way it is told. In all honesty I don't think it's particularly easy to truly capture what Stoker did in literature on film. Suspense in films can't be the same as in literature. I think it's a great film and worth watching."
"windypoplar","8","0","1","14 September 2006"," terrific, sensual , entertainment
","Where to start. This is one of my all-time favourite movies, horror or otherwise. Coppola does a fantastic job of brining Stoker's story back to the Victorian era. The sets are lavish, the costuming and photography excellent. Kilar's core is simply haunting, breathtaking in spots, it stays in your head forever.<br/><br/>What I really loved about this though was the acting. Oldman is great actor and he simply becomes Vlad Drakul. Amazing stuff. Hopkins Van Helsing is a bit punchy, but that suits this version just fine. Winona Ryder was considered too young at the time for this serious project, but I think she does some of her best work. She is innocent and romantic and totally appealing. The rest of the cast is good too, though some work out better than others.<br/><br/>My only real complaints with this version, and they are very minor, is Tom Waits doesn't quite have a handle on Reinfeld and the ending is all Coppola, differing form James V. Hart's script quite a bit. Still its marvelously entertaining from start to finish. Each time I watch it its like a new experience. Very, very good film. It certainly doesn't stint on the scares, or the blood! a must for serious fans of horror."

","This movie's cinematography makes it one of the best movies I have ever seen...only rivaled by Gone With The Wind. The mood and setting are unparalleled by any other movie I can think of. I am about to write a short story for a new book of mine, with a follow up to Dracula in Transylvania -- but in the present day and age. This movie is RESEARCH for me in writing that chapter. I have seen this movie no less than 30 times and any time it comes on cable, I STILL watch it yet again. The acting is superb...cast perfectly...and the visual effects are amazing. I think I finally became a fan of Keanu Reeves when he appeared in this picture! Gary Oldham, to me, will now always epitomize the definitive Dracula."
"lee_eisenberg","5","0","1","15 July 2006"," Mainly good now that Mel Brooks's ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" and that one ""Simpsons"" episode have spoofed it.
","I guess that eventually, there had to be a version of Bram Stoker's classic novel following the original story. However, Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"" suffers under its own pomp, and Keanu Reeves is not really the right choice to play Jonathan (I kept expecting him to say ""Whoa!"" or ""Dude!""). Still, you can't deny that Gary Oldman makes a pretty neat version of the Count, alternating between looking like a centuries-old creature, a modern businessman and a wolf. As Mina, Winona Ryder really gives the impression of a delicate person who may have more to her than we realize.<br/><br/>I actually think that the best part of the movie is the part set in 1462 Romania. The way that Prince Vlad impales the Turkish invaders gives one the feeling that even before he became a full-fledged vampire, he already had sort of a nasty side (although the Turkish invaders probably deserved what he did to them). And I don't think that anyone could have predicted the sword-in-the-cross scene! Anyway, this version is good in the sense that it sticks to the original story, but it's too full of itself to really merit any recognition. And since the Bela Lugosi movies were kind of silly, I still say that the best Dracula movie ever was Werner Herzog's ""Nosferatu"". If nothing else, this movie at least saved Coppola from financial ruin. And how often do we get to hear Romanian, Greek and Bulgarian spoken in movies? Also starring Anthony Hopkins, Cary Elwes, Sadie Frost, Tom Waits and even a very young Monica Bellucci.<br/><br/>Two really cool spoofs of this movie are the ""Simpsons"" episode ""Treehouse of Horror IV"" (where one of the vignettes portrays Mr. Burns as a vampire praying on Bart) and Mel Brooks's goofy ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" (starring Leslie Nielsen as a hapless, clumsy version of the Count)."
"rachelp1984","8","0","1","8 July 2006"," Addicting
","While this is not the best version of Dracula, it is highly addicting. I've watched it at least once a day for a month now. Gary Oldman is brilliantly fantastic, he is both scary and sexy at the same time. In my opinion, Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder are two of the most annoying people ever to be caught on film, and pairing them as Jonathan and Mina Harker is absolutely nauseating. Keanu is boring. Winona is not believable. However, the fact that I love this movie is a testament to its other fantastic features. The direction is genius, the acting - for the most part - is amazing, and Gary Oldman's Dracula is one of the best things you will ever see. Gary is never given as much credit as he deserves."
"john_oneill41","7","0","1","27 June 2006"," Has the word of the novel (more or less) but not the spirit
","The problem I think with this version of the story is that although for a lot of the story it keeps faithful to the book, it seems to lack the spirit of the novel, something the 1958 version with Christopher Lee captured perfectly.<br/><br/>Having said that, the film has a lot going for it in other areas. Gary Oldman was suitably creepy as Dracula and Anthony Hopkins was nice and eccentric. The cast in general were a pretty good choice, with one glaring exception. I really wanted Keanu Reeves to pull this off and if he were to take the role on now, perhaps he might manage, but as it is, most of the criticism is unfortunately justified. He seemed to have only one facial expression the whole time and his attempt at an English accent was at times truly awful. Sadie Frost was exceptionally hot as Lucy and Winona Ryder, unlike Mr Reeves, pulls off an English accent that is spot on.<br/><br/>Visually the movie was stunning, with the proper atmosphere being evoked when necessary. Especially effective was the use of the red sky at the beginning of the film when Jonathan is in the train. However, I found one or two of the scenes in the castle somewhat confusing, such as when Jonathan is trying to escape and is seen to be edging along a ledge with what appears to be a great yawning chasm below him. He reaches a corner and then appears to fall sideways rather than downwards. Of course it could all have done that way to add to the mind bending effect and I'm just too slow to get it.<br/><br/>As I said before, the script for the most part has the word of the novel but doesn't seem to capture the spirit. There isn't really a sense of relief at the end when our heroes win and in fact the entire movie is relentlessly grim. However, all praise must go the scriptwriters for finally having written a version that has Quincy Morris, a character all too often ignored.<br/><br/>Probably the most horrific moment in the whole movie is when Dracula produces a baby for his brides to feed on.<br/><br/>By the way, Quincy/Arthur must have the strongest terrier dogs in the world. When they all chasing Dracula and the gypsies at the end, our heroes are on their horses, galloping like mad, and yet in several shots, the terriers can be seen keeping pace with the horses and hardly breaking a sweat.<br/><br/>I think overall the positives outweigh the negatives and you should see this film."
"one_of_dan","9","0","1","30 May 2006"," My love of Dracula and film
","I love horror books and films as well as the old British hammer house of horror so with all three mixed together I find myself loathing the greatest vampire pix ever made. Yes you can say it was first a book that then scared the life out of many by being put on stage, there have been many Dracula/vampire films made but 1992's Dracula gave what only the book itself could give and that was a true feeling to all the actors, adding romants, making you one minuet against the vamp but then you see he wants a woman who is so much the same as his wife. It's a horror film not to chose sides when watching, one minuet Dracula's look alike wife is taken then he wants her to take his live(to become at peace).<br/><br/>One thing that always keeps my eyes to the screen isn't just the great acting(except, you know, the one from the Matrix)but the amount of detail giving the film a feeling of different mixtures of art, from its us of shadow to the first main screen shot of the three vamp woman I feel it goes well with the flowing of the film."
"alv123","8","0","1","30 April 2006"," A great Horror Movie
","This is a great movie, not because I'm Romanian, but the gore, sensuality, and spirit of Dracula are meticulously crafted. Too bad it wasn't filmed on location, in Transylvania, but Copolla did what he could with the budget he was allocated. There are many factual errors which could have been avoided if more research could have been done. The language in the beginning of the flick is very cool. The Romanian spoken by the priests sound like long gone ex-patriots with clearly accented foreign Romanian. I have to hand it to Copolla for using a lot of the language though, something that is not evident in most Dracula movies.The chicks attacking Keaanu (nice scene)are pretty good examples in the Romanian language. I have the original on VHS, saw part of it on cable just recently, and had to rummage and watch my video once again. If you're squeamish, this is not the movie for you, it is tastefully designed to magnify the destruction that Vlad committed and has truth to that aspect. If only Vlad Tepes was alive today, where would he roam...."

I highly recommend this film for anyone, anywhere, any time at any pace. The most emotional scenes are in the beginning and end. The beginning when we see Dracula fighting as a warrior (Oldman looks a LOT like Vlad The Impaler, it's scary), and finds that his lover is killed by the church, Dracula is filled with anger and stabs the giant cross. Blood seeps from the cross and then we see the title.

"A_Roode","8","0","1","3 April 2006"," Time has made this a better film.
","I remember watching ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" when it first came out and being ... dismayed? Is that the right word? The problem was maybe in Francis Ford Coppola's choice of using 'Bram Stoker' in the title. I believe if you just say 'Dracula' it gives you a bit more creative license -- that is, you can tweak with the story for dramatic purpose and won't have insanely idolatrous fans of the book banging on your door at night screaming about how you've ruined the movie. It has taken 14 years for this version of 'Dracula' to finally strike a chord with me. I'm glad it did because giving it another chance was the best decision I've made in a while (I apparently don't get out much and choosing which movie to watch is more challenging than it appears ...).<br/><br/>What a marvelous performance from Gary Oldman! His character and performance are deeply nuanced and complex. Is he my favourite Dracula of all time? No, but I think he was very strong in this role. Tom Waits also turned in a great performance (though to be honest he was largely unused and while heretical of me to suggest, his entire story and part could have been cut from THIS VERSION of the film). An actor who cheerfully chews scenery, he shares a memorable early scene with fellow scene-chewer Richard E Grant. Grant is very decent in the film although Waits rather victimizes him. Two scene-chewers on screen at one time are rarely good for anything but comedy and that was not the goal in the asylum. Waits was more flamboyant and deserves credit -- Grant would have been wiser to play it a bit straighter. Hopkins and Elwes were impassioned and very good.<br/><br/>What struck me most about this film was the lusciousness and texture. Beautifully (Oscar-winningly) costumed, wonderful score that was brilliantly employed, gorgeously photographed, I could go on. It is from a technical standpoint very good. I love the fact that they employed a lot of older film tricks and looks. The use of the iris to fade in and out, blending different frames of film to superimpose images, using faster and slower speeds -- this film is a breathing textbook. The sets and design are just awesome. I think it is the best work that Francis Ford Coppola had produced in quite some time. Perhaps this titan of film had been sleeping for a while. In my mind, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was a sharp reminder that Coppola is a master craftsman and that he is still capable of producing top-notch films.<br/><br/>So what would have been his attraction to this film? I wonder if there was some attraction to the notion of Dracula being at the centre of moral and spiritual rot -- Physical rot even. This seems to run through much of Coppola's work and I see it here too. The film doesn't take the easy route though which many of my beloved Hammer Horror films do. This Dracula is not just some monster to stick a stake in. He was human once and (while close) is not totally beyond redemption. And, for the record, the opening scene and back-story is tremendously filmed. Unbelievably atmospheric!<br/><br/>There are very tense scenes of menace and horror in this film. There is a cross-country chase scene that is an anxiety-filled race against time and it is fantastically well done. At one point Hopkins must defend himself with fire. Yet another tense and well-done scene. Coppola uses a lot of quick cuts to show the speed of the vampire and while it isn't the scariest film out there, it is still very good.<br/><br/>A lot of the flack that this film takes comes from the emphasis on the love story. It was what I remembered most from my first viewing a decade ago and partially why I detested the film so much then. Time has made this a better film for me and I don't mind the love story so much. The film becomes a redemptive tale. Will the rot that I mentioned earlier consume Dracula and everyone he touches or can they, even in the darkest final hours, be saved? We've seen this played out in other vampire films before but not like we do here. ""Dracula"" is worth another look. And don't worry: the irony that a film about redemption (which I didn't like) but have come to change my mind on hasn't escaped me."
"dupodong_adu","10","0","2","2 April 2006"," love conquers all-------a beautiful tragedy about love and evil
","It's my favorite vampire movie all the time. Full of passionate scenes. The desperate love between a unparalleled beauty and a horrible vampire, who loved her deeply and intensely, even though the love for his princess has passed for nearly 400 years, he never put it to an end, but planted it more deep in his heart and never stopped it from growing stronger and stronger. Maybe he is a devil, maybe he'd drunk up millions of beauties blood without a bit of mercy, but how enchanting he was! His kisses would make every women on earth drunk like a drunkard, never knowing the way home. He would bring you to a place where you never imagine yet ever wanna go. He would make you desert your husband and abandon your sweet marriage to follow him unconsciously. Undoubtedly, he was a monster, but when you'd have met him you'd never know how to reject him, for he was such an enchanting man, a man of men, a pure man,a manly man. What he thought was to press his kisses upon your sexy lips,what he wanted was making a tender yet passionate love with you, what he had done was making you crazy forever. Because God owe him a true love, so he forsook God with millions of rebellions against each beautiful woman he met. But as long as he'd kissed his princess after hundreds of years thinking of her, he at last transfigured into a handsome prince with a full love in his heart. Yes, he was dead, but how beautiful his death was! And how can you imagine another death ending with a beautiful wife around you with her warm arms, and her pure kisses upon your thirsty lips? Hail to the genius of Coppola! Long live the charm of Dracula!"
"nycritic","9","0","2","21 March 2006"," Dracula in Tones of Grand Opera
","When one looks at the works of director Francis Ford Coppola, horror-opera doesn't quite enter the mind, but in 1992 that's just the route he took and it paid off in some ways, while in others, not quite.<br/><br/>Coming off the critical and commercial failure of THE GODFATHER III, which itself closed a decade peppered with cinematic ups and downs, the decision was considered controversial. Throughout the film community (if it may be called so) there was the thought he'd either run out of material or that maybe this was going to be another of his incursions into insanity much like with APOCALYPSE NOW. Either-or, he made the film he wanted to make, and the results are of a director in full command of his talent, his vision, his cast, and even his excess.<br/><br/>And thank God for Coppola's dramatic excess, which is his view. This is the first time I've seen Dracula treated as an opera in which every moment held sway the power of flourish. I enjoyed it. It's very close in style and substance to Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA in lush atmosphere, shadowy visuals, grand gestures, and over the top music. A definite feel for silent Hollywood in which effects were made the hard way, from exaggerated postures, sequences filmed backwards -- every trick in the bag is present, and every one of them is a stroke of brilliance.<br/><br/>I loved that throughout Dracula there is a strong element of Fate, not Chance, from the very moment we see Vlad and Elisabeta being separated through actions not entirely of their own accord. This is vital for a story about romantic horror to work, because it's clear that at some point in the future they will cross paths again, even if the road to this re-encounter will be a bloody one. Had matters been left as they were in the novel -- Dracula being this one-dimensional evil -- this would have been a much darker, grim monster story. Under Coppola he becomes human, the true romantic anti-hero.<br/><br/>And as is with many anti-heroes, he comes with so much baggage and centuries of marinating in his self-absorbed ego within the ruins of his castle in Transylvania it's a wonder he's able to seduce Mina Harker when he catches up with her in 1897 London. Of course, not being quite human in flesh, he is able to manipulate his own energy into the form of a beast or a mist. Knowing his Elisebeta is out there after all, he begins extending his subtle self by one hapless Jonathan Harker (Mina Murray's fiancée). He creates a storm while being transported on the Demeter from his native land to London. As he approaches the new land, Mina feels a shadow move around her, and soon Lucy Westenra, her best friend, is a victim (in more ways than one) of a horrible vision equal parts lust and terror. Mina of course will not see Dracula until later in a beautiful sequence where both meet on the streets of London and converse in a museum where chaos erupts around them, maybe in reaction to his own dark nature. Even so, their acquaintance is formed and evolves until Mina can almost see herself in her prior incarnation. Yes, it departs from the novel but Coppola knows what he's doing: making this horror accessible. Making Dracula a tragic figure, and resolving that which was left in shambles.<br/><br/>At times, though, Coppola's love for grandiosity turns shrill. Scenes in which Winona Ryder must express difficult emotions -- such as her realization of who Vlad really is, and that he killed Lucy -- falters. Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing overplays his role and in trying to bring the wry humor his character was written as possessing he hams it up. Keanu Reeves... well. Could he be more bland?<br/><br/>Adding to this, there are one too many emotional/visual/musical climaxes: deleting just one would have been more than enough as long as they were not Lucy's death scene intercut with Mina's wedding or the tour de force that is the actual climax in itself as the blood-red Sun hurdles down to Earth while two parties race towards Dracula's castle. Just on this basis, BRAM STOKER'S Dracula as per Coppola is a great tale of star-crossed lovers bookended by his forbidding castle."
"dawn2dusk","5","0","2","4 February 2006"," This is not Bram Stoker's Dracula
","This is a fine film, quite enjoyable, good performances throughout (except Keanu, of course, and Hopkins is a bit too over the top), but one thing it isn't, it isn't Bram Stoker's Dracula. Not even close.<br/><br/>Dracula, as described by Stoker, is hardly ""The Great Lover."" If anything, he's the mean, sadistic, evil, rotten, wife-beating son-of-a-bitch bastard that some poor women stick with despite all. Nowhere in the book does Dracula do a single thing that could be described as loving, tender or romantic.<br/><br/>As written by Stoker, ""Dracula"" can be considered a ""Love Story"" only as far as that the title character does manipulate his misguided victims to believe they actually ""love"" him in a very masochistic way -- but there is never any love or anything like love coming from Dracula directed towards his victims at any time: The epitome of a classic highly dysfunctional relationship.<br/><br/>Only Christopher Lee ever came close to capturing his true character (Bela, in his own way was pretty good on this score as well).<br/><br/>Dracula is a horrible, mean, evil, brutal, self-centered, sadistic, egotistical, manipulative wife-beater type of guy -- at least as written by Stoker. The romance in some of the ""Dracula"" films (i.e.: Frank Langella, Gary Oldman, etc.) is just catering to women who like those type of guys but refuse to see what they really are. A kind of ""co-dependency film-making"" when you get down to it.<br/><br/>In a very real sense, Coppola's Dracula is like making a movie where Hitler is ""The Great Romantic Lover."" And just as absurd! I defy anyone who has read Stoker's book to find even a single passage that disputes anything I've written above. Hell, I look forward to seeing it.<br/><br/>Still, a very entertaining flick."

Not a bad movie, but the theme has been changed from ""good versus evil"" to a love story, so be warned. Keanu Reeves, as everyone knows, has all the talents of a block of wood, but try not to dwell on that. What everyone expects of a vampire movie, but not of Bram Stoker's Dracula, let's just put it that way, and don't watch it with your mother in the room. The prologue and romantic subplot give a history that wasn't outlined in the novel (ficticious fiction, you could say) and makes room for a rather unlikely match-up. It's obvious, however, that Coppola tried to remain true to the novel: the film utilises direct quotations and makes an effort to be told in article/diary form. When I first began watching the movie, I thought it was an impeccable interpretation, then, however, it began to veer somewhat off course. Don't let this discourage you from watching, just be prepared. There's an interesting twist on the Renfield character, but other than these diversions, there's nothing too far off from the story. Happy viewing!"
"xhxm","8","0","2","29 November 2005"," A Great Revival
","Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of those movies I simply must recommend. The film is different in many respects to former iterations of the novel. Instead of sticking with the horror formula, director Francis Coppola has intertwined the recipe with that of a tragic love story. This new direction adds much needed life to the overused story and reinvigorates it. From the beginning of the film the tone is dark and foreboding, relying on shadows, and dark colors. The art direction is spectacular, with mouth dropping sets, lighting, and backdrops. One of the first scenes which Dracula (Gary Oldman) is introduced to Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), the foreshadowing of Dracula's true intent and personality come to life with his shadow, seeming to defy any natural law, leaves his body to commit horrific acts in the background. The story is superbly told through narration and the eyes of several main characters: Dracula (Gary Oldman), Dr. Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), and Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves). This is also one of the only letdowns of the movie. The acting throughout the film is almost laughable. Keanu Reeves plays one of the most uninspired and ill-rehearsed characters I have ever seen. Winona Ryder as Mina Murray does not help out either. In her attempt to display affection for Jonathan Harker, she comes off as prudish. Gary Oldman's attempt as Dracula is admirable although long winded; the only person seeming to be a real actor and strong character in the film is Anthony Hopkins, as Dr. Van Helsing. Although for the acting, which is dismissible due to everything else shining of creativity and originality, the film is fantastic. Bram Stock's Dracula takes views of previous versions and adds to them brilliantly. I consider this film a must see for anyone remotely interested in the genre."
"film-219","9","0","2","21 November 2005"," One of the best novel adaptations of all time
","When having read the magnificent novel by Bram Stoker, one's expectations to the film are more than sky-high. The book is written entirely in points of view; diary entries, letters, telegrams, phonographic recordings, etc. This form is what REALLY makes the book stand out from other romantic horror novels of the time.<br/><br/>The film attempts to integrate the book's form unto the screen, and it succeeds well. We hear voice-over comments by Van Helsing (eccentrically portrayed by Sir Anthony Hopkins), Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) and Mina Harker (Wynona Ryder). The storyline is very true to the original (with a slight exception at the end) which surprises but delights.<br/><br/>The visuality of the book is beautifully adapted - but Francis Ford Coppola has let his own visual picture-making influence each and every frame, and the viewer is held captivated from start to end by the colours, shadows and elegant visual effects.<br/><br/>The choice of mostly American actors can be questioned, but it actually works out quite well. Keanu Reeves' accent is slightly un-British in few places, but Ryder and Elwes (as many times before and since) manage the European English very eloquently - to a non-English speaker, anyway. The performance that shines over all is naturally that of Gary Oldman whose presence, intensity, eroticism and undefined Transylvanian (?) accent is simply astounding.<br/><br/>And the girls have wonderful breasts."

Leaving Harker imprisoned in his Castle, Dracula now heads to England to seduce Harker's beautiful fiancée Mina Murray (Winona Ryder).<br/><br/>A superb opening featuring the beginnings of the Count, the film progresses along similar dark veins as we are gradually introduced to the Count. Betrayed by the Catholic Church, the Count is a much more sympathetic character than recent adaptations. No longer just a blood sucker, Oldman's Dracula is a passionate individual searching for his reincarnated love.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of his finest performances, Oldman is sensational with his European accent and his magnificent misunderstood Count. He's not alone though. Aided by some great acting from Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins and Richard E Grant, Oldman is given all the support he could need.<br/><br/>That being said, one key flaw with this film is the truly woeful accent and performance of Keanu Reeves. Reeves has, to personal knowledge, NEVER turned in a decent acting job, and in ""Dracula"" he is no different. Awkward, wooden and generally awful, Reeves lowers the standards of an otherwise top notch cast. Admittedly he is not helped by a badly written character (Harker was dire in Shelley's original book, let alone this screenplay), but Reeves manages to turn a dire character into an horrendous one.<br/><br/>Aside from acting, the one reason 1992's adaptation is so good is because of Coppola's knack for pure, dark genius. He gets a naturally dark story and he makes it his own. The lighting, the feel, everything about the story has a feel of Coppola's work and ultimately it is impossible to fault him.<br/><br/>Like so many other horror stories, Bram Stoker's creation is often stereotyped and corrupt. In this new take of the story, Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"" is a magnificent, accurate portrayal of the story. Beautifully shot, and for the majority, brilliantly acted, this film is well worth watching at any opportunity. Superb."

","Dracula is humanized in this film in a way that has never quite been achieved before and probably could only have been pulled off by the likes of the great Gary Oldman.<br/><br/>The film is expansive and fully-formed. Anthony Hopkins's Van Helsing is thoroughly entertaining, and Renfield and his doctor/jail-keeper are well played. Even the lesser characters, such as Mina's friend Lucy (Sadie Frost) and her groom (Cary Elwes), are well developed. <br/><br/>The strength of this film is the zeal with which it was made. It is an unapologetic, opulent, head-first dive into the rich tradition of Dracula. It simultaneously holds true to key elements of the original, yet realizes so many of the inchoate fantasies that have emanated from this myth over the decades.<br/><br/>The weakness of the filem is Keanu Reaves. His wooden acting abilities are on full display here, and his British accent is pathetic. <br/><br/>I also have mixed feelings about Winona Ryder's casting. She does an adequate job, but she just seems a bit out of place here. Generally speaking, whenever I can't stop thinking of the actor as I am watching a movie (as opposed to her character and the story itself), I feel distracted, and that's my issue with her. She's not convincing in this role.<br/><br/>Overall, a beautiful, extravagant rendition of a dark and seductive classic.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>JEM"

","Thankfully, the performances of Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins counter the dreadful ones by Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder! I haven't seen acting this bad and accents this poor since DiCaprio and Diaz in ""Gangs of New York."" Coppola, as expected, is in fine form; and his dedication to Stoker's wonderful book is quite admirable. The eroticism is, once again as expected, lush; as is the dialog. Following the film's release, Hollywood began basing other films on the books that spawned them; Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, most obviously. (What a ""novel"" concept: staying true to the books.) ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is well done; however, Reeves and Ryder are so clearly out of their league it, often, makes this film tough to watch."

","The legendary story by Bram Stoker has had many film versions made, and this is one of the most interesting ones from director Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now). It isn't completely scary, but it is a dark and mysterious tale. The opening sequence inn 1462 sees how Prince Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman, putting on) became a blood sucking creature when he renounces God and the church after his wife killed herself, thinking he was dead. 435 years later, 1897, the real story begins. Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves, with a terrible British accent) is invented to the castle of Dracula in Transylvania, to help the Count (who looks the age he should be dead) buy Carfax Abbey. After this of course he is held prisoner by Dracula, with the help of his (probably lesbian) wives and some werewolves. With the help of some Transylvanian soil in his coffin, and sucking the blood of many of the crew, Dracula travels in a ship across the sea to London, and while doing so his appearance goes younger, and he will be able to go out in the sunlight. He is going there to meet Harker's fiancée, Mina Murray (Winona Ryder, who couldn't do Coppola's third Godfather film), who bear's a striking resemblance to the wife he once had. Meanwhile, Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is trying to convince everyone involved that Dracula is a vampire, and slowly as some women are bitten, they believe it and know he must be stopped. Also starring Richard E. Grant as Dr. Jack Seward, Cary Elwes as Lord Arthur Holmwood, Bill Campbell as Quincey P. Morris, Sadie Frost as Lucy Westenra, Tom Waits as R.M. Renfield, Monica Bellucci as Dracula's Bride, Michaela Bercu as Dracula's Bride and Florina Kendrick as Dracula's Bride. The visuals are intriguing, almost like classic horror, including shadows on walls, eyes and faces in the sky, rats walking on ceilings and much more, a good old-fashioned dark film with a lot of sexual images (more than many other vampire films) and bloody effects. It won the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Sound Effects and Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects.

","Count Dracula, a fifteenth-century Romanian nobleman, is overcome with grief at the death of his beloved wife Elizabeth. Renouncing Christianity, he pledges his soul to the Devil and is cursed to walk in limbo forever as an undead vampire. Four hundred years later he is meeting with Jonathan Harker, a London solicitor's clerk, when he sees a photograph of Harker's fiancée Mina, who looks the image of Elizabeth. He imprisons Harker in his castle and travels to London to woo Mina, but his vampire attacks draw the attention of the eminent Professor Van Helsing. Mina is seduced by the Count, but does not yet know his true identity, whilst Van Helsing and his friends are closing in.<br/><br/>What to say about this movie ? It's brilliant - it's the work of an extraordinary director. It's visually sumptuous, extremely well made and one of the more faithful adaptations of an oft-filmed book, but it also takes far too many liberties with certain characters and story aspects, which can prove distracting. Let me take the good points first. Visually and aurally, this is a sheer delight from start to finish; it was all filmed on stages and the sets are just stupendous, as is the powerful bass-string score by Wojciech Kilar. The photography by Michael Ballhaus is simply stunning - every classic horror trick is used; up lighting, candles, reverses, extreme lenses, fake shadows, mattes, different speeds, iris pulls, partial dissolves, what have you. Almost every shot, particularly in the first three reels, has some brilliant effect going on - perhaps my favourite is the moment when the mysterious coachman quite literally picks up Harker. Equally creative are Eiko Ishioka's amazing costumes, which transcend time and place and push traditional garments just slightly over the edge into fantasy; Dracula's clothes alone are worth watching the movie for. Coppola manages to direct with seemingly wild abandon but never once is the story sacrificed for arty pretension. He also captures beautifully the feeling of the ages passing in Dracula's world, contrasting his medieval castle in Transylvania with modern London, full of new inventions and engineering marvels (wax-cylinder recorders, typewriters, the cinematography, etc). The cast throw themselves into their gallery of lunatics with admirable gusto, though slightly varying success. Oldman is terrific under several different complex makeup jobs and brings out the romantic melancholia of Dracula perfectly, but also his terrifying feral side. Hopkins lends gravitas to Van Helsing without too much hamming (though he does keep adding an unnecessary letter ""i"" to Dracula's name), and Grant and Waits give solid horror-movie stock-character performances. Ryder and Reeves, as the young lovers Jonathan and Mina, try their best and are very pretty people, but are a little out of depth. So what's the problem ? It's that over-inflated title. James V. Hart's script is good and he has carefully adapted the novel closely, but this movie is also greatly influenced by the many previous film versions (essentially it has the look of the 1922 F.W. Murnau / Max Schreck version and the heart of the 1931 Tod Browning / Bela Lugosi version) and invents some new mythology for itself, and as such it is not a definitive movie of Bram Stoker's great book. So for the record horror fans, where does it differ ? Well, for a start there's the middle-ages prologue, based on the legend of Vlad Tepes, which is good and bookends the story nicely, but is a bit fanciful. There are some important plot points not in the book (the business with the locket where Dracula sees Mina's image, Renfield's preceding Jonathan as an emissary to Transylvania) and a few key omissions; there are no rats in the coffins at Carfax Abbey when there should be thousands (this is done brilliantly in the 1979 Werner Herzog / Klaus Kinski version) and the mark Van Helsing puts on Mina's forehead with holy wafer symbolising her unclean spirit is significantly absent. Where this version goes completely loopy though is the relationship between Dracula and Mina - here they are star crossed, infatuated lovers, separated by the ages. In the book he sees her as just another one of his victims and she is revolted by him. Their lengthy courtship in London is completely fabricated, as is the finale within the chapel of Castle Dracula - in the book Jonathan and Quincey kill Dracula just as the sun is setting, and he fades into dust. I guess what irks me most about this version is the emphasis on romanticism - in Stoker's book, Dracula is a monster, a fiend, a selfish, greedy, vicious, horrific creature of the night, and his presence instills only dread horror. He is like that too in parts of this movie, but in the middle-section particularly he is also a bit of a soppy, flowery-shirted wet blanket. However, whilst the title may annoy me, in the end this is a great adaptation of Dracula and a fabulous horror movie."

This movie is one of the few i have seen that at least tries a little to follow this concept and does it successfully. I won't elaborate much on the story since it is well known to most people.<br/><br/>More than anything this movie is a feast for the eyes and ears. The cinematography and camera-work is outstanding. The effects are also very very good and the music is a masterpiece from composer Wojciech Kilar. Gary Oldman is magnificent as count Dracula and further heightens the experience. The rest of the cast are also mostly well cast. Unfortunately one of the things that really disturbs me is Keanu Reeves portraying the important character Renfield. I can't understand why they would choose to use Keanu Reeves with a thick obviously fake accent when there are so many good British actors around. When will film-makers realize that the audience DO appreciate a good actor rather than a big name on the poster?!<br/><br/>The focus in this film is on the love story. Something that contributes to the fact that you many times feel sympathetic towards the vampire. And it also lends a warmth to the story that many other similar films lack.

","Though not the most faithful version to Stoker's novel, Coppola's lavish cinematic effort is sumptuously detailed and well written. James V. Hart's screenplay retains many aspects of the original novel not seen in other Dracula films, but imposes a love story between the legendary vampire and the story's heroine, Mina Murray. Diverting from the original monstrous figure terrorizing Victorians in the 1897 book, this movie portrays Dracula as a more romantic anti-hero pursuing his immortal love.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman's performance as Dracula alone is worth watching; his transition from ancient, eccentric recluse to dark, dashing gentleman is seamless. His sympathetic portrayal, along with brilliant costume design and make-up effects, breathe new life into a very familiar character.<br/><br/>At the film's opening, we are introduced to the historic mercenary who inspired Dracula, Vlad the Impaler, offering an origin for Dracula's cursed immortality--the suicide of his beloved wife causes him to renounce God. Some 400 years later in Victorian London, young solicitor Jonathan Harker sets off for his ill-fated trip to Transylvania. (Keanu Reeves' stoic performance, though not brilliant, actually works here as the repressed and reserved Victorian gentleman.) While Harker assists in Dracula's purchase of London property, he shows the count a picture of his fiancé Mina, which sets up the film's love story--Mina reminds him of the wife he lost centuries ago. <br/><br/>While much of Stoker's plot is retained and respected, the film's bent on portraying Dracula and Mina as star-crossed lovers imposes a tension between the two not originally intended by Stoker that often leads to artificially sentimental dialogue and scenarios. After Dracula imprisons Harker in his castle, he sails to London and courts Mina in scenes completely invented for the movie (strolling to the cinema, waltzing by candlelight). Meanwhile, Dracula is attacking Mina's close friend, Lucy, whose mysterious illness from Dracula's visits is actually the central part of the novel. When Lucy's condition worsens, her three suitors (all included for the first time in any film version) call upon metaphysical guru Professor Van Helsing, the Obi One Kanobi of the Dracula legend. As Dracula desperately romances Mina, Van Helsing gathers the incredulous gentlemen together in a hunt to vanquish the vampire and, in consequence, love's fulfillment. <br/><br/>The film's treatment of the book is better than most, but what really sets this version apart is its artsy cinematography. It's very mesmerizing--the story is told in a sort of dream-like kaleidoscope, with transitions that vary from fluid to frenetic. The romantic sub-plot, woven throughout the entire film, sometimes works in this style. When Dracula recounts his past to Mina over a glass of absinthe, images of his former bride falling to her death are collaged in the background. This one scene conveys the essence of the entire film--Dracula sees Mina as his last hope for rekindling his lost love.<br/><br/>This film is an opulent visual feast that fluctuates from faithful literary homage to complete artist license--with a few moments of contrived dialogue and unforgivable sentiment--that ultimately shines as a beautiful cinematic masterpiece."

I supposed it was Coppola's aim to do it that way. So, why did he make up that love-story between Dracula and Mina Harker? There's no such thing in the novel. Did he do that in order to make his film more commercial? Was it a Hollywood imposition? I assume that it is impossible to recreate chapter by chapter that great novel (they'd need to make a 5 or 6 hour long movie), but you can't add things to such a masterpiece. I mean, are you making an adaptation or are you not? Browning or Fisher didn't called their movies ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", because they knew their movies hadn't nothing to do with the novel; and I think Coppola's shouldn't have called his Dracula as Bram Stoker's. <br/><br/>OK, once I've make clear that this is not an EXACT adaptation of the story let's talk about the movie itself: Coppola made an outstanding job with the technical part, the photography is just perfect, the colours, the shadows, the atmospheres, the special effects... The movie has such rhythm (except for those scenes that develop Dracula and Mina's lovestory, which are rather hackneyed and sickly), and they made a nice job with the script (Dracula is a novel based on diaries, letters, etc. so it was not easy to convert that into a cinema script). These are the good things about Coppola's adaptation. Now the bad things: again, that love story; the character of Van Helsing is much more rude and reckless than Stoker's creation (although Anthony Hopkins plays it in the best possible way); the characters of Quincey, Seward, and Goldmig aren't properly developed, also they failed to recreate the love and the friendship among those characters... and last, but not least, I don't like the work of Winona Ryder (her performance is such ridiculous in some scene such as that one beneath Dracula's castle) nor Keanu Reeves' (couldn't he be a little more expressionless???). <br/><br/>PS: Maybe I'm being too harsh judging those things in relation to the novel adaptation (the characters, the mistakes...), but Dracula is one of my favourite novels ever, so I can't be very tolerant about it :D.<br/><br/>My rate: 7/10"

","I must admit that I saw this film after reading the book and I was therefore ready to point out any errors that the director/writers made. However to my surprise I found myself really drawn into the world of Francis Ford Coppola and his spin on the classic tale.<br/><br/>It must be set from the start that Dracula would not be an easy book to adapt from, as rather than there being one long narration, the story is told through a series of diary entries that sometimes conflict and overlap. However while the story of Stoker's book is not strictly true, the atmosphere that comes from this movie would do no writer shame.<br/><br/>This is mainly to do with the cast. Winona Ryder makes an engaging Mina Murray and Anthony Hopkins is very good as the old Van Helsing. It is only Keanu Reeves that doesn't measure up with his performance of Harker, seemingly attempting to cover a thin British accent with a lot of British chiches.<br/><br/>But as good as Hopkins and Ryder are, it is Gary Oldman as the Count himself that really drives this movie. His brilliant ability to play both the old and the young count with aplomb as well as his menacing yet somehow sensual demeanor is what really what makes this movie shines. Other actors that deserve mention are Richard E.

","Spoilers within.<br/><br/>Eye-popping grandeur mark this version of Dracula.  The atmosphere and the costumes are fantastic, giving a look so realistic it pulls the audience into the film.  The same can be said for the make-up effects, which are truly scary at times.  The transformation of Dracula from an ancient man who looks as though the dust he is made of is about to return to the floor, to a batlike creature, to a sadistic wolf-man monster shows what can be gone without the overuse of computer graphics.<br/><br/>The acting is passable in most cases, even superb in some.  Anthony Hopkins is an ideal Van Helsing, reciting the oddest phrases as though they were perfectly natural.  He embodies the quirky but righteous character so well remembered from the novel.  He is a worthy adversary to Gary Oldman's count. Oldman gives Dracula humanity as a lost and lonely immortal who misses and is trying to find love.  The only really poor acting comes from Keanu Reeves as Johnathon Harker.  His accent is distracting, and he reads his lines rather than making them interesting.<br/><br/>The story deviates widely from the book at times, but not to its detriment. It is fascinating to watch Dracula trying to find the love he misses so much, the woman who killed herself when she thought he had died, as revealed in the opening flashback.<br/><br/>This version is not for the faint, being frightening in places and intensely sexual, but it is a work of art."

","First off, i've never read the original book.  I am led to believe that in terms of sequence of events and characters this film is quite close to it. <br/><br/>
The romantic theme and overtone is completely new, (apparently) however, and while that's a huge change, i rather enjoyed it as it made Dracula, or Prince Vlad, more of a tragic villain.  Of course, the gruesome details of the historical Vlad III, whom, (although never ACTUALLY stated in the book OR movie, i don't think) the supernatural Dracula is undeniably based on, were largely ignored or only lightly touched upon in this movie; but I think that's more so you can actually empathize with the antagonist. <br/><br/>
Great performances by Oldman and Hopkins.  The rest of the cast wasn't bad... although i do think Reeves was miscast...<br/><br/>Interesting directing style and cinematography, too.  Sometimes, however i didn't exactly know what was going on, and i think that was just a symptom of the ""artistic"" efforts of the filmmakers.  If i were to pick a definite weakness of the film that'd be it.  On the upside, however, that ""weakness"" leaves much of the film, including the ending, very up for interpretation to the viewer, which is kind of nice.  Some of the ""tools"" like the superimposition used very often in the film were very effective.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is appropriately creepy most of the time, there's a good link between the bloodlust and pure lust, and the love story is a first in Dracula movies, i think, which is nicely creative.<br/><br/>A definite classic."

There were several things that I hated about this movie, but one tops them all.  That would be Gary Oldman's line ""I crossed oceans of time to find you.""   The movie is far too heavy handed, and takes itself MUCH to seriously.  There was one redeeming quality, he goes by the name Anthony Hopkins.  The movie suffers from inconsistent spirituality (Christianity and reincarnation shouldn't go together), Dracula's hair being two feet tall when Harker arrives at his castle, and a vampire that isn't nearly as terrifying as he is a lovesick puppy-dog.  The cast is talented, but the movie doesn't flow at all.  I spent a lot of time wanting someone to look at the camera and say ""oh come on.  This is just too much.""  I have a whole lot of trouble with the concept that Dracula really is a sweet guy who did it all for love, and then asks for (and recieves) God's forgiveness.  I haven't read the novel Dracula, so it is possible that all these terrible and annoying things are in the book, and the movie was just being true to it. If so, the movie should have been less true.<br/><br/>I recomend The Lost Boys or even Interview With the Vampire if it's a vampire movie you want."

It just crams so much pointless storyline into not-to-be-taken-seriously film, with the actors speaking pseudo-Shakespearean lines...its just not worth it.<br/><br/>The performances are good though, Anthony Hopkins putting forth the most, playing a very cool Van Helsing - better than Hugh Jackman.

He's really made nothing very good since ""The Godfather: Part II"".<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the climax is both very fun and very exciting.  Surprising that Coppola filmed such a great action sequence, it was like a combination of a good western with a great chariot race.<br/><br/>To me this movie is floating around somewhere in between 6.5 and 7, but I'll give it a 7 out of 10 for its performances."

","It's strange...  People either love this film or hate it utterly.  Me? I liked it despite its many flaws, but I am also prejudiced where Gary Oldman is concerned.<br/><br/>Bram Stokers Dracula is NOT by any means faithful to the novel penned by Bram Stoker, but it tried harder to stick to the original storyline than the Lugosi version did.  Combining the tale of Stokers immortal vampire with the biography of Vlad Tepes the notorious Impaler, this film is a rich, full feast of colorful visual metaphors that just about leap off the screen and slap you in the face.  The sets are gorgeous; elegant manor houses, cold forsaken castles, misty woods filled with graceful wolves.  The actors are slightly less effective than the scenery, I'm sorry to say.  Keanu Reeves is (as he always is outside of his Bill & Ted role) stiff and lifeless, his English accent so weak it practically needed crutches.  Winona Ryder irritated me very badly, emoting so hard I kept expecting her to explode as she bulged her eyeballs and gasped like a fish, clumsily stumbling through the entire movie.  Anthony Hopkins was rather enjoyable as the weirded-out Van Helsing.  But this movie belonged to Oldman and no one else. <br/><br/>
Oldman's Dracula is a powerful character, complex and stunning.  He is cold and cruel, sweet and sorrowful, sadistic and sexy.  Oldman has always been one of my favorite actors.  Always, he makes me believe in the characters he plays whether it's a despicable cop, (The Professional) a stupid junkie, (Sid & Nancy) a bumbling Shakesperean misfit (Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead) or a 400 year old vampire who has damned himself for the sake of love. Hey, anyone who can manage not to laugh during his love scenes with the ridiculous Ryder has my deepest respect.<br/><br/>No, this is not a flawless film, but it has its beautiful moments; absinthe and blood, sepia-toned silent films filled with lust, violence and sex hand in hand rather than one standing in for the other, and Oldman's performance is strong enough (in my humble opinion) to carry the entire film to its satisfying end."

","Bram Stoker's Dracula by Francis Ford Coppola is a very good, but not great film. It's supposedly the best film version that conveys the novel's original story. There are several weaknesses in the film. First of all, the casting of Hopkins, who is normally good in everything, isn't quite right. Secondly, this is not one of Winona Ryder's strongest roles to date either. Her Mina is vulnerable, but not fully realized. Her accent wasn't very good either. In fact, few of the accents in the film were good. I don't consider Ryder compelling enough as a woman to convince me that Dracula would choose her as his eternal bride either, although the nymphet look was in during the Victorian Era. Thirdly, Keanu Reeves is not good at all as Jonathan Harker and he even seems silly at times. The story lags just a little at times too, but at over 2 hours long, that can happen even in good films. That being said, the film has many things to highly recommend it too. The star performance of Gary Oldman as the Count is magnificent indeed, but I felt that the tinted glasses catered to a young demographic movie audience, instead of adding anything to the character. Sadie Frost was quite good, releasing a lot of raw sexual power and energy as Lucy. The production itself is the real star of the film here. The cinematography is lush; the costumes (won an Oscar) are lavish; the makeup (won an Oscar) on Oldman is great; the music is hypnotic; the sound is crisp; the sound and visual effects are stunning. Think of the recent Sleepy Hollow and From Hell, and you can imagine the sumptuous production values that this film contains. The story is mostly familiar, even if you have never read the book; because, it contains many of the same scenes from previous Dracula films. Yet this one interweaves a religious motivation for the Count's search and portrays him as a horrific, but tragically sympathetic figure. This is a great date movie for sure. Look for Monica Bellucci as one of Dracula's three brides and what looks like Charlie Sheen on the sidewalk, tipping his hat, during the scene where Winona Ryder (Mina) first meets Dracula (Gary Oldman). *** of 4 stars."

But I was in for a major disappointment. Still, this wasn't an impediment for me as I watched it again a few days ago and couldn't get through some issues.<br/><br/>Coppola thought his film would contribute to cinema vampirology. In what way? Erotic-wise? Hmm... All through the film, I had the feeling it pretends to be something artistic while it's not. The whole arsenal of ancient cheap horror movies is employed here just to amaze fragile audiences: blood splattering, mountain-high waves, all types of flames, ghosts and apparitions. This feeling of ""cheap"" maintains even in the scenes presumably shot ""outdoors"" when you can easily see indoor props (the forest and the way to Dracula's castle, Lucy Westenra's yard).<br/><br/>
But what bothers me the most is the distortion of geography and history altogether. There are unforgivable geographical errors (Varna is thought to be a Romanian harbour, the mounted fearless vampire killers reach Galati in just one night leaving from Varna, Arges flows through Borgo Pass   (W H A T ???)- which is actually Pasul Bargaului). Also, LOTS of clumsy pronunciations of Romanian dialogues (""Thu eshti dragostia vetsii miele"", ""Vant, ada-mi an dor di daca"", ""Acest barbat umi apartsina"").<br/><br/>Summing it up, I don't think accuracy was what the producers and director were after.

I found it to have a rather poor production value and a weak ending. It does however posses some good qualities like a great score by Wojciech Kilar( a name suspiciously similar to my college professor's:) and of course Gary Oldman. His role as Dracula is almost legendary and rightfully so because his over-the-top performance fits the movie perfectly and is one of those roles that no other actor could have done half as good(like Brando's Godfather, Denzel's Training Day, Sellers Pink Panther, McDowell's A Clockwork Orange, Spacey's The Usual Suspects, etc) But the rest of the cast is more or less miserable and Keanu should thank his lucky stars for ever acting in another movie after this one.

","Having read and enjoyed the book I had high expectations for this film. I hadn't seen any other adaptations either, so I would have nothing but the book to compare it to. So I ordered the DVD. I know you shouldn't judge a DVD by it's cover but when I saw the tagline, ""Love never dies,"" alarm bells started reverberating through my skull.<br/><br/>I don't remember this in the book but what the hey, i'll give it a go anyway. From the first scene I saw exactly what Coppola had done. He had taken Dracula away from it's traditional horror roots and slapped a love story on top of it, for a blood-thirsty bloke this was a little hard to handle. With so much artistic license, could Coppola really claim that this was Bram Stoker's Dracula?<br/><br/>There were elements of the film that I was pleased with though. I was very impressed with the frequent reference to the characters' diaries, the writing covering half of the screen was a very clever visual technique.<br/><br/>
The plot had been a bit mashed up in order to fit it into two hours but this meant that the characters do not grow as close as they do in the text. To be honest there is very little character interaction in the film. Gary Oldman, Sadie Frost and Anthony Hopkins all put in strong performances but i'm a little bewildered as to how Keanu Reeves got cast. He was so sure he was the one, I wonder whatever happened to him?<br/><br/>This film uses a lot of strong imagery and in places is visually entertaining. Some of the techniques employed are very clever and pretty unique. However some of the special effects looked a little on the lame side. The make-up department had a field day on Oldman's many guises and it's much to their credit.<br/><br/>Dracula lacked the tension to make it a true horror and as a fan of the book I wasn't really impressed by the romantic dimension that had been added. Romance fans and followers of artistic films will enjoy, fans of the book might want to avoid.<br/><br/>Dracula bites the dust with 6/10"

","I really expected this to be better.  It had a lot of good things going for it.  Good cast, with the exception of Keanu Reeves, good director, a good story to work from.  But even with all that, I found it to be very boring. That could be blamed on the fact that Dracula is one of the most told stories in cinematic history, with tons of versions.  But still, it could have been done much better.  The action, what little there was, was severely lagging, and the acting talent was pretty much wasted.  However, it did have some very nicely done cinematography that was pretty interesting to watch, and the make-up effects were cool.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman as Dracula.  That alone sounds like it'll make a good movie to me.  I mean, he's the man of a thousand evil faces.  And while he did a good job, it wasn't enough to save the movie.  And neither was Anthony Hopkins, playing Van Helsing.  I'm convinced you could put Hopkins in anything and make the movie better.  He could make a Barney movie better.  So I have to think that Dracula was a pure fluke.  So had to have been casting Bill and Ted's Ted as Jonathan Harker.  Let me speak for everyone when I say, `Huh?' I've always liked Winona Ryder, and I liked her in this, too, as much as I could anyway.  Most of the time I was just being bored.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola he did The Godfather, and even better, The Godfather, Part 2.  Then he did Godfather 3 and that just went straight to hell.  But still, this is a guy whose done good movies wait; he also executive produced Jeepers Creepers  Okay, so maybe the guy's starting to loose it in his old age, but this was back in '92 which was the movie he did right after Godfather 3 wait a minute, maybe this isn't such a surprise.  Also, he did start his career working with/for Roger Corman.  Ok, mystery solved.<br/><br/>Then we have the story, Dracula.  Sure it's been done repeatedly, it was even one of the very first movies ever made (as Nosferatu).  There's obviously something good here, if it's being done so much.  So how come this version, with all the things that say it should be good, is so damn boring? Maybe because it's two hours and ten minutes long.  Well, Fellowship of the Ring was even longer and that kept me on the edge of my seat, even the second time I saw it.  Maybe it's just cause somehow they messed up the flow of the movie and they had a lot of stuff going on, but nothing actually happening.<br/><br/>Most of the time, when I do reviews, I talk about the good aspects of the movie for three paragraphs and toss in all the bad stuff in the last one. This is a reversal of my usual way of going about things.  So, what good things were there in Bram Stoker's Dracula?  Well, through a lot of the movie, there was a lot of really cool camera work.  But even that tends to get overdone after a little while, and near the end of the movie, it just disappears.  The make-up effects were another good thing about it.  They transform Gary Oldman from young, to old, to a wolf-man, to a bat-man, to headless.  But of course, it's like any other movie Gary Oldman's in.  He never was the same look twice.<br/><br/>Overall: From everything I heard about this movie, I figured it would be great.  My uncle told me that after the opening credits, it all went downhill, and he was right.  It's more of a weird, long, boring love story then any kind of horror movie.  It's worth maybe borrowing from a friend to check out once, but that's about it."

Only Tom Waits, as Renfield, seems up to the challenge, but his presence is not enough to help this lumbering waste of time and money.

Actually, the title of this film is deceptive.  Despite screenwriter James V. Hart's arguments to the contrary, this film certainly doesn't accurately convey the contents of the book, which he seemed to view only as a treatise about repressed female sexuality in the Victorian period.  With that in mind, one shouldn't be surprised to see that the filmmakers chose to treat the film primarily as a romance and not a horror story.  However, there is still much to satisfy hardcore fans of the genre here.  This is a visually-impressive film with a somewhat surreal story-book quality.  Gary Oldham is quite impressive as Dracula. He handles the count's various forms and incarnations with aplomb.  Anthony Hopkins is also fun to watch as doctor Van Helsing.  Other actors didn't fare as well, such as Keanu Reeves, who seemed to struggle with the English accent.

That performance is by Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>Now.  I am not backing away from my judgement by saying that Keanu Reeves is, in fact, not that bad of an actor.  I actually thought he did a good job in ""Parenthood"", and, if I'm going to be honest, he helped make ""The Matrix"" work.<br/><br/>However, Reeves performance as Harker is staggering in its ineptitude.  It's not just the accent.  His reactions (key to a film actor's work) to events around him were either inappropriate or non-existent.  His chemistry with Winona Ryder (who I think did an adequate job here, particularly in her attraction to Gary Oldman) was also non-existent.  Was he supposed to be bland so we would actually root for Lucy to be with Dracula?  Well, folks, there's such a thing as stacking the deck so blatantly that you cheat the audience, and this is an overwhelming example of it.<br/><br/>I have to say Francis Ford Coppola has to take at least half the blame here. Why did he cast Keanu in that role?  If he had to cast an American to balance Winona, why didn't he cast someone who could play the role, or at least was right for the role?  Did the studio force him to cast Keanu? Remember, this is the man who fought a titanic battle with Paramount over casting Al Pacino in ""The Godfather"".  Of course, this is also the man who cast Sophia Coppola in ""Godfather III"".<br/><br/>Sorry, Gary Oldman.  I thought your semi-sympathetic portrayal of Dracula was more than worthy.

","One of the great novels of the English speaking world is Bram Stoker's DRACULA.  Although filmed too many times to count, and burdened by the trappings of too many bad films that almost make it camp, there is a richness and quality to the book that has never been captured.  Although Coppola makes a good stab here, restoring characters like Arthur, and trying to go by the book (the Bela Lugosi version was based on a play, as was the Frank Langella version), the script strays too far.  The biggest problem is an attempt to compromise with evil.  We forget how up-to-date the novel was because it was written 100 years ago.  But Mina used a typewriter;  Dr. Seward kept his journal on phonograph records;  Jonathan Harker referred in the novel to the modern 19th century.  Characters thought themselves as modern and up to date and civilized as we do today.  Dracula is a power figure, slowing showing himself as vastly evil, and he is transported from the rustic mountains of his homeland to (what was to the book's first readers) a modern, non-superstitious, workaday metropolis in England.  It's probably impossible to recapture that spirit in a movie because of moviegoers' preconceptions.  Nevertheless, the backstory (ridiculous whether there's a grain of truth to it or not;  you cannot really draw dots to connect Vald the Impaler with the Stoker's powerful Count) and the threads from it running through the story arc, detracts from the story.  In the book Dracula starts out an avuncular figure who evolves into a fearsome vampire, with a mixed crew of thoroughly modern people -- including a psychiatrist, a solicitor, a secretary, and several upper-class party-people -- reluctantly finding themselves as the ones with the burden to rid the world of the evil. Coppola compromises with evil.  Yet a vampire is, by nature, a soulless body that subsists by drinking the blood of the living, and multiplying its kind.  Dracula is one of the most powerful figures in all literature, and the evil he represents transcends merely individual bloodsucking.  That Coppola chooses to give us a kinder, gentler Dracula, and chooses to make compromises with evil (he may be a bloodsucking monster, but he has feelings!) in a way that may be indicative of society as a whole, but which perverts Stoker's entire point and inverts his characters, making Dracula ""misunderstood"" and those out to destroy them as self-righteous prigs.<br/><br/>The movie's cast is varied.  Anthony Hopkins is extremely over the top as van Helsing, but gives a good performance for all his fireworks (I suppose one who spends his nights hunting vampires is entitled to be a little looney).  Tom Waits was a brilliant casting choice.  Keanu is the only actor who seems totally lost at sea, and weighted down by his phoney English accent.<br/><br/>The cinematography is the only part of the movie that works.  Although Coppola's camera-tricks become a bit tiresome the fifth or sixth time you've seen them, ""Dracula"" is a beautifully photographed movie. <br/><br/>
One despairs of ever seeing a version of ""Dracula"" that truly does present Stoker's story.  The Louis Jourdan version, half-videotaped, is far superior to this, and Jourdan doesn't appear as the kindly old host at the beginning, and the character of Arthur is, as usual, lost.  Judi Bowker, however, is a far superior Mina than the pouting Winona Ryder."

","Because of the accents (Romanian? German?

What's not to like about a movie that casts oddball crooner Tom Waits as the fly and spider eating Renfield, a role very memorably played by the tragic Dwight Frye in the 1931 Lugosi version? Then you've got the great Anthony Hopkins on hand as an eccentric and uncouth Professor Van Helsing, and Gary Oldman as the Count of the title. Visually, the film is masterful, sumptuously photographed and stuffed from end to end with fascinating and provocative imagery, the highlights being at Dracula's castle where the old Count, his hair in a bun, slithers about, casting shadows that are never in synch with his movements, and licking the blood off his houseguest's razor.

In fact, given that his real forte is being calm and doing physical things like running, one can probably conclude that the script writers didn't really have him in mind for the Jonathan Harker part.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, given that Cary Elwes is actually in the final scene but doesn't participate in the sword play, one can also conclude that the scriptwriters didn't have him in mind for the Lord Holmwood either.<br/><br/>Hmmm... actually, following this train of thought, what exactly is Winona Ryder doing here again?

","I just saw this movie again last night and once again was really irritated by it.  When it originally came out, I didn't know about IMDB, but now I have a forum.<br/><br/>Many people seem to think it's not really valid to complain that this movie isn't like the book.  I'm sorry, but when you include the author's name in the title of your movie and advertise the movie as the most faithful to the book yet, you set yourself up for that sort of criticism.  In varying degrees, all of the other versions of Dracula fall short of faithfulness to the book, too, but none of them had the gall to call themselves ""Bram Stoker's.""<br/><br/>Some people have commented that Coppola ""added a love story.""  He didn't ""add"" a love story; he made the whole thrust of the film that love story. So where did this plot come from?  Let me introduce you to the science fiction/fantasy writer, Fred Saberhagen.  Name seem familiar?  His name is on the novelization of this movie.  But back in the 1970s, he wrote a book named ""The Dracula Tape"" - the Dracula story from the Count's point-of-view, how Mina was the love of his undead life.  <br/><br/>This movie was NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula.  It was Fred Saberhagen's.  Here's Fred's Dracula-series bibliography.  Looking for Dracula sequels?  Here they are:<br/><br/>The Dracula Tape (1975) The Holmes-Dracula File (1978) An Old Friend of the Family (1979) Thorn (1980) Dominion (1982) A Matter of Taste (1990) A Question of Time (1992) Seance for a Vampire (1994) A Sharpness on the Neck (1996)<br/><br/>Visually, this movie owes a lot to Creepy and Eerie magazines from the 1960s and 70s, particularly those floating eyeballs in the clouds. <br/><br/>
And then the one picayune thing that just drives me crazy.  They just had to introduce the main story with ""London, 1897..."" and then proceed to dress everybody in the height of fashion for ""London, 1887"" (or even earlier). The extreme bustle worn by Lucy and Mina in this movie was way out of fashion by the late 1880s.  Lucy and Mina should have looked like Gibson girls, if they had wanted to be in 1897 fashion.  It was as if you staged a production of ""Hair"" using the costumes from ""Grease.""  And they got an academy award for this."

","This movie had such potential, but failed to deliver in practically every way imaginable. For those who say it is faithful to the novel, all i can say is, what novel do you mean? Certainly not Bram Stoker's classic, that's for sure. Just because it might contain some of the same lines, which the writers obviously threw in just to give it a semblance of Bram Stoker's novel, does NOT make this ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". Okay, the sets were okay; the costumes were okay; the music was okay; even some of the acting was okay - but 'okay' doesn't really cut it does it?<br/><br/>To re-hash a point which most of the reviews seem to agree with - Reeves is laughably mis-cast as Harker, yes for his pathetic attempt at an English accent which he seems to forget altogether at some points, but also because he is just too young to play the part of Harker with conviction. His acting just makes a bad movie even worse. Ryder's accent was almost as bad, just very poor indeed. How could they not cringe when they saw (and heard) themselves in this movie? Oldman was okay as Dracula, and Hopkins was nothing to write home about either. There were points where you just wished that Dracula would suck the life out of both of them and give us all a good laugh! Yeah, pretty scary alright?

"Shield-3","Null","0","1","16 January 2002"," Not Stoker's Dracula, But Still Fun
","I think the secret of this film is to not dwell on whether or not it is an accurate adaptation of Stoker's novel: it isn't.  I remember a literature professor I had in college who taught `Dracula' in one of his classes; he said there was always at least one student every semester who would try to get around actually reading the novel by watching the movie instead.  If they try that trick with this version of `Dracula,' they're in for a surprise.  There are details here you don't see in other Dracula movies, like the blue flames on the road to Dracula's castle, or Dracula wandering the streets of London in daylight.  Then there's BIG changes, like an origin for Dracula and the romance between the count and Mina.  This is a shift in the fundamental character of Dracula, altering him from a dangerous predator, almost a plague unto himself, to a tragic lover, thus changing the tone of the entire story.  <br/><br/>Okay, so `Bram Stoker's Dracula' isn't Stoker's after all.  Does that make it a bad movie?  Hardly.  This `Dracula' is an epic, Gothic, lush thrill that builds to a near-hysterical pace.  It succeeds in mimicking the novel's sense of panic and overwhelming horror, and if you can accept the film on its own outrageous terms, then you can enjoy it.<br/><br/>A word about the casting, which wanders from perfect to baffling.  Anthony Hopkins brings his usual class and presence to Van Helsing, creating an aura of forbidden knowledge around the professor.  Gary Oldman makes a fine Dracula, sometimes swathed in heavy makeup for Dracula's many changes, but always projecting an arrogance laced with tragedy.  William O. Campbell, Richard E. Grant and Cary Elwes are perfect as Lucy Westenra's three suitors, just as I imagined them.  Then, for some reason, the producers injected Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder into the mix: while they are fine actors, they just don't belong here, and the movie suffers for it.<br/><br/>So.  While it's not the definitive retelling of Stoker's novel that it claims to be, `Bram Stoker's Dracula' is still an atmospheric, grandiose movie, and well worth watching."

","The second or third time of watching this movie I sat down with the novel in front of me and followed the dialogue with the book..., as for being true to the book it was, it followed the diaries of Mina and Johnathan to the letter for the most part and I was impressed with that.  As for the romance that the director insisted on inserting between Mina and the Count.... what can I say things that make you go hmmmmm.  (Although I was impressed with the scene dealing with the ""green fairy"" although that is an in joke).  Despite the above it was a visually stunning movie to watch and the scene with the ""Brides"" and Johnathan was incredibly erotic (one of the most erotic I have seen on screen I would say).  I have to admit though when it comes to eroticism that the Dracula with the Frank Langella and Kate Nelligan love scene in front of the fire is by far one of the most erotic ever filmed.  If this movie could have been filmed with Frank Langella as dracula I think it would have been perfect.  While Gary Oldman is an outstanding actor I think that he lacked the sex appeal that dracula obviously needs, he has to be sexually attractive for the women to be  attracted to him so and of course that is what Bram Stoker tried to portray in his novel but it being written in Victorian times he had to keep it under the surface.   to I believe that Frank Langella portrayed that evilness and sexuality beautifully.   Bottom line, brilliant movie that has a few flaws but it still worth watching again and again."
"mentalcritic","Null","0","1","22 September 2001"," A mix of bad and good...
","I'll start with the bad first, because it will take a little longer and I like getting unpleasantries out of the way quickly. The most obvious problem with the film is the cast. Never have I seen so many miscastings in a single Hollywood production, and that is really saying a lot. For example, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves in any film set in Victorian England is a big, big mistake. The two look so out of place that it really destroys the whole illusion within one shot. Give their roles to people like Helena Bonham Carter and John Cusack, people who are actually capable of acting, and the results would have been quite a long way better. Then there's all the nonsense with Dracula's ability to appear as mist, a wolf, or a total of five different things during the film. This really made it difficult to understand what on Earth we are supposed to be afraid of. The use of religion in the film as a plot device was a minus, too. Just watch the behaviour of the ""good"" Christian boys throughout the film and see if you'll still wonder why a lot of audiences root for the vampires in these films.<br/><br/>The new introduction describing Prince Vlad's life was a nice touch in spite of it not being at all part of the novel, however. For once, it is nice to be shown the sort of atrocity the bible inspires on the big screen, even if it is still very inaccurately described. The rest of the film is faithful to Bram Stoker's original novel in a way that no other film has accomplished. Rather than presenting some hokey vision of the original legend revolving around bad actors in cloaks and tepid women who are only interesting as props, they presented the vampire legend as Bram Stoker saw it. The women in the film are powerful, interesting characters, the big vampire lord himself has a reason for the things he does, and the fear or fanatacism in the so-called ""heroes"" is there to be seen in plain colour. Anthony Hopkins does a brilliant job of making his character seem like one of two evils, while Gary Oldman injects a depth into Prince Vlad that has never been achieved in cinema before. As he mopes about his castle, searching for the lost love of his life that was so cruelly taken from him (and let's not forget how cruelly the salt was rubbed into the wounds by those so-called good church boys), one begins to understand his pain and anger. Which is why the ending works so much better here than it does in the novel. Bram Stoker's novel simply has the men staking Dracula and cutting his head off... no cop outs like that in Francis' film. He uses this as an opportunity to fully resolve the painful conflicts that made Dracula what he is.<br/><br/>Were I making this film again, I'd do everything Francis Ford Coppola had done, with some small adjustments. First of all, I would get better actors to play Jonathan and Mina, because actors like Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder seriously lack the depth to play anything other than stock American youth stereotypes. Even though Natalie Portman clearly doesn't look old enough to play Mina Harker, she'd wipe the floor with Winona Ryder simply because she is capable of getting into character. I am not sure if I would have cast Anthony Hopkins... if I did, I would give him strict instructions to cut out the overacting. And I would have changed the script a lot to deemphasise the religious overtone. It wasn't that strong in Bram Stoker's novel, and raising it this far in the film was disrespectful. People have already learned (often with the help of such cults) that real-life, everyday evil blows away what can be portrayed on the screen. Removing it altogether would have eliminated the lack of sympathy one feels for the characters. Other than that, I would have done everything pretty much the same. Maybe they should have let Kenneth Branagh direct this one too?<br/><br/>In all, I'm giving Dracula six out of ten. While it is mostly faithful to the novel in a good way, the additional religious mumbo-jumbo that was inserted in the screenplay just bogs it down, and the casting agents should have known better. The overuse of special effects in portraying five different Draculas was also a bad idea. Still, I think people should focus more on what they did get right, and this is without a doubt the closest we've ever gotten to seeing the real Dracula on-screen."

","I can't understand why everyone raved about this film. The art direction wasn't so great. Its only purpose was to give an MTV gloss over to an incurably weak film and try to sell it to teenyboppers. A ploy which, I'm sorry to say, worked. It shouldn't have, however, because everything looked completely cheesy like it was some kind of live action cartoon. The movie was done entirely on sound stages, and it shows. Like we would be fooled when everything looks plastic and fake. Maybe thats OK for made-for-TV movies and mini-series, but for a major theatrical release I'd expect some effort(actually, it was originally intended for the small screen until SOMEONE(you know who you are)had the bright idea to make it into a theatrical release). Coppola, who has admitted to directing films via radio from a bathtub, has realy gone downhill since......the invention of film!! Neither Keanu Reeves or Wynona Rider have convincing accents. They're probably proud of themselves too; infuriating, isn't it? Another point I find....interesting...is that Bram Stoker not only wrote the book(which isn't that great, I barely could get through the first quarter) he also wrote the stageplay which was adapted into the 1931 version. Yet Coppola's version(which was adapted into a new screenplay, which they take license with anyway)is called ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", when the 1931 version was the one actually written by Bram Stoker! The poor devil is probably turning in his grave. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was an aweful movie, and I wish it never had to exist, and if YOU are one of the people who likes it...STOP IT, NOW! There might still be hope for you. There are plenty of good movies out there, WHY THIS ONE!? WHYYYYY!?

"oldbollweevil","8","0","1","1 July 2001"," It's a Coppola film.
","Perhaps Coppola's true genius lies in his ability to totally mold his style to his subject matter.  With some directors, no matter what the film you always know you're watching a film by that director-- Woody Allen comes to mind, or even Martin Scorsese, most of the time.  Quentin Tarantino or Oliver Stone, definitely.  With Coppola, and it's going to sound strange to say this about a director with such an outsize personality--Coppola always submerges his personal style in the story he's telling.  Maybe a better way to put it is that his personal style consists in reinventing his approach with every story.<br/><br/>That's why, for me, even his less popular movies are interesting: each film, from One From The Heart to Rumble Fish to Gardens of Stone, creates a completely unique mood, extending to every detail of set design and cinematography.  The man has perhaps the greatest range of any modern director--and exhibit A would have to be this:  that the same man that gave us the incredibly subdued, tight Rainmaker a few years ago had only five or six years before that made Dracula, as over-the-top a film as you can imagine. And it works.  Brilliantly.  The lavish sets and costumes (courtesy of Eiko Ishioka) are only the most visible of the effects Coppola creates in this movie.  Just as important is the way he puts together the narrative--all those elaborate transitions, the image overlays, the diary and letter readings.  They all contribute to creating a slightly stilted, starched-collar, almost operatic atmosphere that perfectly suits the material.  In this respect, I find Keanu Reeves's limitations as an actor working in the interests of the material for once:  his stiffness actually contributes to his character's believability.  It's easy to see why Mina would prefer Vlad to him.<br/><br/>Coppola's respect for the material manifests itself in the technological subtext.  To a modern reader, 1897 feels like the ancient past, but Stoker's London audience was on the cutting edge of modernity--they must have felt just as much in control of their environment, on track to conquer the last mysteries of existence, as we do.  Coppola brilliantly succeeds in making new ""wonders"" of the period such as the cinematograph and the typewriter seem thrillingly up-to-date, which just emphasizes the horror of this unnatural, unexplainable thing that has swept in from beyond the pale of civilization.  Note the heroes' pride when they believe that they can outrace the Count by taking the train, a recent innovation--and of course they fail.  Perfidy can always trump technology.<br/><br/>Another master stroke is the way Coppola suggests a repressed erotic undercurrent to the straitlaced culture of the Victorian age.<br/><br/>The briefly-glimpsed kiss between Lucy and Mina is a wonderful touch--is it erotic or completely innocent?  They probably don't know themselves.  Sadie Frost is fantastic in her role, managing to maintain this balance between innocence and wantonness all the way through, even as her character descends into horrifying depths.<br/><br/>Performances:  uniformly excellent.  Anthony Hopkins is a hoot as Van Helsing--almost as creepy as Vlad himself, and a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder gives perhaps her best performance as a woman who embodies the repressions of her age--she really doesn't seem to know which she wants, Vlad or Jonathan.  Rather, she seems to sincerely want both, alternately.<br/><br/>And Gary Oldman is transcendant.  His performance is the romantic core that makes the movie work--we fully believe that he is evil and must be stopped, but at the same time we can truly sympathize with him.  Oldman makes us believe that Vlad's condition is a result of his love--he takes that motif from a mere plot enabler to the central, supporting element of the film.  A great performance (even if we can't understand what he's saying half the time!).<br/><br/>The only reservation I have about the film is kind of hard to put my finger on.  It has something to do with the fact that _everything_ is there on screen--there aren't enough shadows, there isn't very much left unseen or unsaid.  In a sense that feels true to the conception of the film, a sort of old-fashioned aesthetic in which light and dark are clearly delineated, just as there's no confusion in Van Helsing's mind between his admiration for Vlad the man and his hatred of Dracula the monster.  A noir approach would have injected too much irony, too much cynicism in what is, finally, a very old-school sentimental, romantic story.  But having the monster waltz across the center of the screen in all his red-caped, white-bouffanted glory is a bit of a departure from the conventional image of evil lurking in shadows. Maybe a little disconcerting.<br/><br/>Still, I give it 8 of 10."

","O.K.This is the most expensive dracula film of all times.That doesn't make it the best though.In fact the only thing I like in this movie is the,beyond belief,fantastic soundtrack.Other than that,there are too many flaws in the movie.First of all it is not such a faithfull adaption of the book as many would have you believe!There's too much romance in this movie.The actors,although big names all of them,are awful.Gary Oldman as Dracula is ridiculous.I hate him.He is not creepy at all.Winona Ryder as Mina is o.k,and Keanu Reaves as Harker is really good.But the huge disappointment is Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing.He makes Van Helsing look really foolish.This is the worst part Hopkins has ever performed!!The film is slow and dull.It is clear that is was made for big audiances,much bigger than your average horror film.If you are a horror fan you won't like this,if you're not you will.I expected much more though.A missed oportunity for vampire though."
"rlcsljo","8","0","1","28 December 2000"," Almost as good as ""Dracula's Dog""!
","Just Kidding!  I just wanted to point out that the Dracula phenomenon has been so over the map that Coppola's genius in this movie was to play it (almost) straight.  Although Dracula was played sometimes in an almost ""Kabuki"" fashion, there is extreme attention to detail and an attempt to set the mood of the time. (I had the chance to visit the set while it was being shot and it is amazing how the simple sets were made to look so opulent on screen).  The characterizations were just kooky enough and straight enough to make you want to watch the screen play forever.  Unfortunately it had to end and the ending was less than satisfying.<br/><br/>If you want to see how a master film maker handles a too oft campy legend, this is the film for you."
"Hannibal Bates","7","0","2","4 December 2000"," Good but not great Coppola
","Okay, this film version of ""Dracula"" has the greatest eye candy of them all. You can give Coppola a standing O for that. But it also hurts the film just a little bit. ""Dracula"" seems to lose that gritty feel here. It's almost to artistic. The film also drags in some parts. And I was disappointed in how they handled Renfield.  The acting overall is great. Oldman shines, Hopkins is perfect & Ryder still lives on as one of the most underrated actress out there. The only mistake in the cast is Reeves. He seems so wooden that I was amazed saw dust didn't come out of him when the wives of Dracula had their way with him. There is one plus for all horror film fans. Unlike the two greatest ""Dracula"" films (""Nosferatu"" & 1931's ""Dracula.""). This ""Dracula"" has lots of blood. Just not in the way you might think. Overall a good film, 7 out of 10."
"hmmm...boy","Null","0","1","15 November 2000"," Alright, but not great
","This film is a moderately good adaptation of a novel, the imagery is strong but it lacks any real tension or excitement to keep it moving. The love story is sappy and it would have worked better if the film had been made as a true horror film. Keanu reeves was terrible, his poor acting doesnt do anything to improve the films quality. The film was set in Victorian times, but Keanu reeves poor acting doesnt make it sound like a realistic victorian accent, it just makes him sound like an american actor putting on a bad english accent. The Victorian times may have been uptight, but Keanu reeves isnt believable for a second as an Englishman. Because of this, the film is heavily americanised and suffers from it."
"yenlo","Null","0","1","30 October 2000"," Not bad but it can't match Hammer Studios.
","It's not the best Dracula film ever and certainly doesn't match anything Hammer Studios put out. Yet it's not the worst. I came away with the feeling that the special effects were really trying to give it that Gothic Horror atmosphere which I don't think it can. I'll say one thing I wouldn't have set one toe in the castle after getting a look at the Count let alone sit there and have a chicken dinner!"
"metta-4","Null","0","1","2 September 2000"," It sucks, but it is definitely not blood!
","Coppola may have established himself as one of the greatest directors, but his version of Dracula is way beyond bad. Okay, I have to admit that as a typical Hollywood production it is even more than acceptable. Bram StokerÂ´s Dracula however must not be treated as such! It deserves some dignity; unfortunately Coppola was probably more interested in making big money instead. Portraying Dracula as softcore porn in the U.S.A had to be a box office hit without any doubt. The cast he worked with looked promising, but even the talents of Hopkins are invincible and Reeves makes a clown of himself as he tries to speak the Queens English. Gary Oldman is obviously working hard, but he cannot convince as Dracula for one single moment. Oldman simply does not look aristocratic and there is a total lack of horror in his presence. A production like this proves that the best vampire- & Dracula flicks are history. If you want to see a real gothic vampire movie you better look for the old Hammer series. Coppola, Oldman and Hopkins should have studied their colleagues Terence Fisher, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee from the Hammer studio before making this bloodless film!"
"yedgar","7","0","1","16 July 2000"," Stylistic opulence at the expense of heart and soul
","this film is first and foremost about style.  the director  pulls out all the stops (perhaps excessively) to make for a visually striking, but also highly contrived, movie experience. the story and characters take second place to coppola's masterful stylistic manipulations as director. the costumes and set pieces are gorgeous.   the film's gothic atmosphere is highly charged with dark eroticism and sensuality, most obviously manifest in the character of lucy, played with slutty mischievousness by sadie frost.  keanu reeves is rarely a good choice for any part and here he is particularly ill-cast.  winona ryder, as delicately luminous and porcelain-skinned as she may be, also fails to give her character any real edge or depth. in the case of both young actors their silly english accents only emphasize their shortcomings in their respective roles.  anthony hopkins takes his usual place by pompously posturing as the brilliant but creepy weirdo.  gary oldman in the key role, however, is marvelously convincing as the tormented yet magnetic count dracula.  his performance is genuinely good.  but even dracula is secondary to the real point of this film: the showcasing of coppola's prodigious skills as a stylist, which alone is reason enough to watch"
"richard.a.cross","Null","0","1","7 June 2000"," Beautiful filming... lousy acting.
","I saw this last night on Film Four (Channel Four's digital movie channel) and my opinion of it hasn't improved since I last watched it on video. The most distracting part of this movie is, of course, Keanu Reeves' appalling 'English' accent.<br/><br/>I've questioned the use of second-rate American actors to play British people elsewhere on this site (Robert Downey Jnr.'s awful 'Dick Van Dyke' accent in Natural Born Killers).  This is something that should be sorted out in the initial casting.  Some people are good at accents, some aren't. Good actors should have no problem.  As Quentin Tarantino said regarding the casting of Tim Roth as an American in Reservoir Dogs, ""This is what actors do"".  He was wrong about Tim Roth, though (what a terrible New York accent that was...).<br/><br/>And then there is Sir Anthony Hopkins.  It kills me to see such a fine actor perform so poorly.  Was the director on set during the filming of these scenes?<br/><br/>It's such a shame that something as easily avoidable as this can ruin an otherwise brilliant and beautifully filmed movie.  There is absolutely no suspension of disbelief, as you are always aware that you are simply watching actors, parading in front of a camera.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Tom Waits, however, give inspired performances, save the movie and make it worth watching for their performances alone.  Hang on, aren't those last two Americans?  Doing flawless English accents?."
"ealasaidh","Null","0","1","7 May 2000"," Eeeeeh, not as good as it could have been.
","While I agree that the character names, some of the dialog, and the overall plot (sans the romantic additions) were taken from the book, that is where the resemblance ends.  What dialog does remain from the book is often inserted in the wrong place (eg, Mina's ""will you do the same when my time comes"" speech).  The addition of a romantic plot deviated so incredibly from the book that at first I was unable to enjoy the film at all.  Once I gave up and stopped trying to compare it to the novel, I liked it a lot more. This is a good movie, but it is NOT Bram Stoker's version of the tale."
