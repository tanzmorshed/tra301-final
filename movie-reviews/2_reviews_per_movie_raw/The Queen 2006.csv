","A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent."
"marcosaguado","9","397","458","10 September 2006"," Helen The Great
","Let's start by saying that the film itself is a perfect reflection of the days we live in. A deep human drama with a tabloid sensibility. A tradition that's lasted over a thousand years shaken by a world who demands public spectacle. Humbleness or humiliation? Asks Queen Elizabeth to her Prime Minister. Talk Show audiences wouldn't know the difference and we are all, one way or another, talk show audiences. From Jerry Springer to Oprah Winfrey. How did it really feel like? We all want to know, we all want to see the sorrow, the confession or the denial on the catch of the day's face. Michael Sheen is a adorable, yes I think adorable is the right word, as Tony Blair, the labor link between the people and the monarchy. Helen McCrory as Mrs Blair is another standout. Just look at her walking backwards trying to to be true to royal protocol. I had to adjust to the fact that the Queen Mother was played by Sylvia Syms. Sylvia Syms! Queen Mom, a wonderful old battleship who's seen it all and fought her entire life for things to change so they could stay the same. It is however Helen Mirren, in a performance that could only be described as miraculous, that takes us body and soul through the painful ordeal of those seven days surrounding the death of Princess Diana, the ""people's princess"" a natural master in a world of tabloids and self humiliation disguised as humbleness. Helen Mirren gives us more than a glimpse into the hermetic heart of a living queen. Not a single false note, not a single cheap shot. A performance that is as poignant as it is entertaining. I was as besotted with Helen's Queen as her Labor Prime Minister was. I can't wait to meet her again."

","It was Meryl Streep no less to call Helen Mirren ""an acting God"" and she wasn't kidding. I saw ""The Queen"" again last night, a year after the hype, the awards and the masses of superlatives thrown Helen Mirren's way and you know what? It was all richly deserved. Her performance got an extra something along the year and I believe it will continue to grow like most wonderful true things. Helen Mirren is not an actress who ""dissappears"" behind a character , no, she is in total control and that's what makes her creation so moving. The illusion is fueled by her own conviction - the character's as well as the actress's. Last night I wondered, during the Queen and her Prime Minister's walk, how did the real Elizabeth II reacted to this portrait. I'm sure she's seen it and I'm sure that she must agree that nobody could have done it better or more fairly."
"ccrivelli2005","9","323","391","10 September 2006"," Long Live Helen Mirren
","I saw her Elizabeth I not so long ago and I was bowled over by her fearlessness, I was moved, transported, amused. Now, Elizabeth II, the living Queen. Helen Mirren accomplishes the impossible. She lets us know the Queen, her Queen, without passing judgment. Just being her. I found myself understanding her dilemma in human terms. Something that she had done so brilliantly with Elizabeth I, she humanized her or rather she allows us to find the human creature behind the iconic fa√ßade. The difficulty of not falling into a caricature or a simple impersonation may have seemed insurmountable but here she is. Perfect, real, extraordinary. Long Live Helen Mirren!"

","How silly of me. I kept putting off seeing this movie because I had an acute case of ""Dianaetis"" Too much about the doomed princess of the people. Well, I was wrong. I was very, very, wrong. The film is a surprising, unpretentious masterpiece and I haven't mention Helen Mirren yet. Apart from the fact that it's a film perfectly suited to be seen in your own living room or like me, in bed, it's also cinema with capital letters. The illusion created by Helen Mirren's portrayal is total and I mean total, eerily so. There were moments in which I was seeing the real thing or the ""royal"" thing I should say. When Elizabeth II bows to pressure and returns to London and views first hand the overwhelming show of affection for Diana, something happens to her, we will never know what exactly, but something. That in itself is Helen Mirren's mastery. To tell us exactly that without revealing anything. Needless to say I'm buying the DVD. I know I will see this one many times."
"roland-104","10","47","55","30 November 2006"," Here's a film for my all-time top 200 list!
","It's still early innings, but Stephen Frears's The Queen is definitely going on my short list for best film of the year, and it will stay there. It's a flawless, burnished production, a virtually perfect film. This glowing, suspenseful docudrama retells the story of the days of upheaval in London and elsewhere, in 1997, shortly after Tony Blair had just won for Labor, by steering clear of trades unions and welfare statism, while flogging his ""let's modernize Britain"" program, window-dressing for his Clinton-like political shift to the right.<br/><br/>Then, on August 31, Princess Diana, recently divorced from Prince Charles, was killed in a high speed auto accident in midtown Paris. The film's story turns on how various echelons of British society reacted following Diana's death. Dramatized are many vignettes that bring together the major personalities at the center of the highly public dilemma that unfolded in the few days following Diana's passing.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren was, as they say, born to play Queen Elizabeth II. In every tableau, in every body movement, in every nuanced shift in feeling she conveys to us, with or without words, she is simply majestic. But this movie is far more than a showcase, a star vehicle, for Ms. Mirren. Each of the major supporting players, portraying some prominent person, is superb. Besides The Queen, we have The Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms), Prince Philip (James Cromwell), Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), Mr. Blair (Michael Sheen), and their respective retainers, playing out at close range their responses to one another, within the framework of a taut cultural and political crisis, one that is, above all else, a threat to public support of the Monarchy.<br/><br/>This drama takes place in an enervating, though also suppressed, emotional atmosphere, the tension level constantly ratcheted up by the principals' responses to pressures from the public and the press. (Of course the accuracy of the depictions is open to some question at least, and, in addition, there is the insurmountable problem that no one knows for sure the full truth about many of the rumored conversations -discussions that might or might not have transpired among these people - that are dramatized here. It is fair to say that the actors have magnificently sculpted their characterizations to fit the common perceptions of these celebrities in the public eye.<br/><br/>But there's more: I haven't yet touched on the main reason that I think this movie will be considered a classic decades from now. That is it's overarching subtext, not about individual personalities, but about a deep change in the very fabric of social custom signaled by events after Diana's death, especially in Britain, but also in the U. S. and other ""anglophilic"" ""developed"" nations. The point is made crystal clear in the film: Elizabeth's seemingly callous aloofness from the public in the wake of Diana's death is the result of her conviction, based on her upbringing, that duty must come first, that stoicism is the face one shows the world, while personal feelings are an entirely private matter, hence not to be aired in public. One must soldier on. Stiff upper lip. The English way.<br/><br/>According to this film narrative, Queen Elizabeth makes a serious miscalculation when she fails to consider, or perhaps even to perceive, the fact that the terms of public discourse - perhaps especially with regard to the open expression of personal sentiments - have changed radically around the world. Frank disclosure of personal feelings and issues once considered taboo for public consumption, emotional ""witnessing,"" and even mass catharsis, have for many become the norm, displacing public stoicism, in response to poignant events. We know this from many lines of evidence, of course: confessional literature and film; the outpourings of personal tragedy and conflict on ""Oprah"" and a host of clone television and radio shows, and so on. But the Royals' cloistered existence very probably has always shielded them from accurately gauging the pulse of popular societal changes.<br/><br/>Never in recent times had there been such a worldwide wave of acute public grief over the loss of a single person, perhaps not since John Kennedy's death, as was the case of Diana, whom so many admired, revered, indeed, loved, even if from afar. The Queen documents with brilliance and power this major sea change in societal conventions, a shift that historians will undoubtedly look back upon as one of the most important and influential quakes in the tectonic annals of civil conduct. My grades: 10/10, A (Seen on 11/29/06)."

","No matter who you are, what's your political stand, or your social status, if any. You won't to turn the page or look away from the TV set if there is a piece of news concerning the royals, the British Royals in particular. I think it's human nature so there is nothing we can do about it. That's why it's amazing to realize that the Queen didn't quite understand that and how powerful and moving her surrendering to the fact. I don't know how to describe Helen Mirren's portrayal but I'm tempted to say already (I only saw the film last night) that is among the best I've ever seen. Riveting, totally fulfilling. The illusion is complete and without mockery or mimicry Helen Mirren gives us a full picture of someone who only exists in our minds as a title and in a series of constantly repeating images - hats, smiles, hand waves and holiday greetings from a TV screen - Congratulations to everyone concerned. A total triumph."
"PizzicatoFishCrouch","8","234","335","27 September 2006"," Pointed and Impartial. Mirren is superb.
","On the 1st of September 1997, the world saw tragedy. In the turmoil that followed, Princess Diana's death was blamed on the Media, the driver, and an entire array of others, before the upset and ill-meant malaise of the public was turned sneeringly to the Royal Family. In this film, we get a glimpse of what life was like inside Buckingham Palace, and whether The Queen (played here by Helen Mirren) was being cold and uncaring, or, if she was the one who was suffering most of all.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Frears recreates one week in 1997 with intelligent, deft strokes. The presentation of Princess Diana is artfully done in news snippets and archive footage, which brilliantly demonstrates the high impact her being had on people. The design of The Queen's home and her surroundings are convincing without being overly showy, and the Alexandre Desplat score is by turns dark, sad, and grand, perfectly summarizing the mindset of those involved.<br/><br/>But the film belongs to Helen Mirren, who takes on of her most challenging roles and showing us that behind the Queen lay a person, and one with feelings. In her role as the reigning lady, she is the epitome of suppressed disappointment and hurt. The Queen chose not to make a parade of her feelings in response to Diana's death, and, though the nation hated her for it, we learn here that it is not because she did not care, but because she honestly thought it the right thing to do.<br/><br/>As a young and newly elected Tony Blair with big aspirations and an even bigger grin, Michael Sheen is freakishly good as the Prime Minister. His performance shows a likable side of the prime minister in his refusal to side with the public over the denouncement of The Queen for her actions, and his attempts to make The Queen limit the damage that she has made is the basis for a very insightful story.<br/><br/>Other delights in this film come in some high-brow one-liners and some other good performances, but the best thing about it is how it manages to make you think, and even empathise with a group of people that you never saw yourself giving a toss about. At under 100 minutes, The Queen is funny, pointed and highly intelligent, showing that, as always, there are two sides to every story."
"gradyharp","10","54","72","25 October 2006"," Helen Mirren Creates Another Triumph!
","THE QUEEN seems like one of those biographical features that would be difficult to hold anyone's interest - on the surface, without the benefit of knowing much about the content. Queen Elizabeth II is not exactly a figure who generates anything but a response of boredom, so flat and uninteresting is her persona. But enter Helen Mirren, one of the finest actresses on the screen today, and this potentially boring potentate becomes a vibrantly detailed and fascinating portrait of a queen at odds with the times. It is a staggering achievement.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Frears, using a superb script by Peter Morgan, details the time from the election of Labor Party Prime Minister Tony Blair (a brilliant Michael Sheen) to that momentous international outpouring of grief and love that followed the tragic death of Princess Di in 1997, showing the bifurcation of response between the Royals and the People as represented by Blair. Instead of the insensitive cold figure that the world witnessed as QE II, Mirren shows us that the woman who is Queen actually had feelings for her grandchildren, a respect for her station as royalty, and was gradually responsive to the cry of the people via Blair's influence, allowing the world to pay proper tribute to a heroine. The ogres in the Balmoral Castle were in fact Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mum (Sylvia Syms) abetted by the very proper Robin Janvrin (Roger Allam) and the wishy washy Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).<br/><br/>The entire production is beautifully filmed with the use of clips from Princess Di's life (and death) instead of creating an actress role to portray her - a very wise choice. The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is superb (with a little help from Verdi's 'Libera Me' as sung by Lynn Dawson and the BBC chorus for the funeral portion). But indeed the accolades go to Helen Mirren in an Oscar worthy performance - with the very strong counterbalance by Michael Sheen. An excellent film about a moment no one will ever forget.

"lecomtess_montecristo","10","32","41","26 September 2006"," Outstanding
","Everything, really utterly and completely everything in that movie, from the performance of the exquisite leading lady down to the smallest word or movement was perfect. There isn't a single flaw in it, not one, not a single one. I was a bit tired while watching it, but still that movie held me mesmerized to the screen all through it. Helen Mirren brought to life a Queen Elizabeth II that I would have never expected, and the outstanding performances of Michael Sheen as Blair and James Cromwell as Prince Philip (and the entire supporting cast) only made everything that much better. I will be the first to admit that I respected the British people for managing to uphold this wonderful ages-old tradition in today's modern world, and if I were British, I guess I would have shared in their royalist pride (although I do wish you could go to London and bring back souvenirs that didn't necessarily have a monarch's face plastered allover them). But I remember when Diana died, I was one of those ignorant people (yes, after that movie especially, that's the word I would use) who were bullying the queen for her lack of emotional display. This movie set right certain things that have been bothering me for quite some time whenever I thought back to what I was like at the time. It put many things into an entirely different perspective (not nearly all of which having to do with Lady Diana's death). But most of all, it stripped the queen of her ice before my eyes, and revealed a human being that ironically enough, the movie also made me understand why I did not see before. To top it all, there is the wonderfully tactful and flowing dialogue, and the mesmerizing performances of Cromwell and Sheen at both her sides. The movie, just as its leading lady, flows gracefully, with quiet dignity and respect, and captures the audience's hearts in the way we would least expect. I almost cried several times throughout the movie, and the memory of Diana was only one of the reasons; the Queen was the other. I also have to salute the cinematography in this film, especially sequences the likes of the one that led up to Diana's death, which was brilliant, as well as the various combinations between original and archive footage. So in a nutshell, my verdict? An absolute must-see, regardless of whether you're a ""fan"" of Her Majesty or of Lady Diana or neither. Go see this movie, it will change the way you see so many things in your life, I promise that much. I guarantee it. And if Oscars were still being given out to people who deserved them¬Ö but we all know that's wishful thinking. Let's just say that Helen Mirren deserved much more than 5 minutes of standing ovation. I know it's strange coming from me (or anyone), but I believe the Queen herself, if she is in fact anything like the Queen portrayed by Mirren, would have been very proud of this movie."
"Chris Knipp","9","159","248","29 September 2006"," A tart, able tribute to two big Brits
","Stephen Frears' The Queen, written by Peter Morgan (co-author of The Last King of Scotland) and starring Helen Mirren, is a glittering, compelling, solemnly anxious news comedy about the week in late summer, 1997, when Tony Blair, fresh in office as new-Liberal Prime Minister, ""saved"" the British royal family, or saved it from itself, when Lady Di died in Paris. Partly the Queen, Prince Philip, and Prince Charles, all in their own ways, loathed Diana for what she had done to them, which the public, conditioned by the mass media to adore her, could not know about. Partly the Queen wanted to shelter the boys, Diana's sons, from the noise of publicity, which would only aggravate their grief. Partly, and perhaps most of all, she was being the way she was raised, keeping things to herself, maintaining the immemorial English stiff upper lip. But also as Peter French has said about this film, the royal family ""are shown to be morally and socially blinkered."" Tony Blair reluctantly taught the Queen to see their absence of public response to the death, her insistence at first that it was a ""private, family matte,"" was a disastrous policy that had to be reversed.<br/><br/>Diana had skillfully manipulated the media to form an image of herself combining Demi Moore and Mother Teresa. And she was still associated with the royal family, and appeared as wronged by them. You don't turn your back on that. You eat humble pie and play catch-up. But a monarch isn't tutored in such strategies.<br/><br/>No flag flew at half mast over Buckingham Palace, because that flagpole was used only for the royal flag, to show if anyone was home, and they were all at Balmoral, being private in their grief, avoiding publicity, and protecting the boys.<br/><br/>The Queen as seen here and imagined with enthusiasm by Morgan is not as witty as Alan Bennett's Queen, in her last on screen recreation, in A Question of Attribution (directed by John Schlesinger, 1992), nor does the estimable Ms. Mirren (who's nonetheless very fine) have the buoyancy of Prunella Scales in Schlesinger's film. But she is witheringly cold toward Tony Blair, all foolish smiles on his first official visit to the Palace. (Blair's played by Michael Sheen, who's experienced at this game.) As Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian, ""Mirren's Queen meets him with the unreadable smile of a chess grandmaster, facing a nervous tyro. She begins by reminding him that she has worked with 10 prime ministers, beginning with Winston Churchill, 'sitting where you are now'. As put-downs go, that's like pulling a lever and watching a chandelier fall on your opponent's head."" Fully recognizing the crucial importance of the British monarchy, this film is tartly reserved about both sides of the game. The royal family don't like ""call me Tony."" And Blair's wife Cherie is a bit ungainly in her blatantly anti-monarchy attitudes. But when Blair sees how Elizabeth's coldness and invisibility is angering the fans of Dady Di ¬ñ the media queen, the ""People's Princess"" -- alienating her own subjects en masse, he steps in and persuades them to leave Balmoral and look at the thousands of flowers for Di piled in front of the Palance with their humiliating notes; then deliver a ""tribute"" to Di on TV. The formal grandeur of the film inherent in its subject matter ¬ñ the Prime Minister and the royal family ¬ñ is offset by its ironies and by the intimacy of the tennis match that develops in communications back and forth by telephone.<br/><br/>This movie is ultimately kind to Blair and to the Queen. It makes us feel sorry for Elizabeth, whom Blair comes to defend (against some of his cockier associates, not to mention his wife) with ardor. In Peter Morgan's second imagined interview with Blair the Queen coolly observes that he confuses ""humility"" with ""humiliation"" (he hasn't seen the nasty notes on the bunches of flowers for Diana); and she sees his kindness as merely due to seeing that what has happened to her could happen to him as quickly. As for Blair, the Brits may have little use for him now, but the filmmakers acted out of the belief that this week when he averted disaster on behalf of the monarchy was his ""finest hour."" Frears has had a varied career, with high points second to few, concentrated in the decade of the Eighties after he came off doing a lot of television. These finest hours include My Beautiful Laundrette, Prick Up Your Ears, Dangerous Liaisons, and The Grifters. For a while there it looked like he could do anything, then more as if he would; but he's admirably willing to try new, as well as dirty, pretty, things, The Queen is dignified, but contemporary. It's bustling and grand. Loud music and vivid performances help. Mirren's Elizabeth is more of the Queen and less of the Queen than Prulella Scales' briefer performance. Bennett's Queen was very clever. Morgan's is sad and noble. The Queen, which is dignified, but contemporary, shows where the Brits are now, and the effect of Lady Di. QEII, like QEI and Victoria before her, has had an extraordinarily long and successful reign, half a century (obviously Mirren is younger than the actual Queen.) But with these events, with this crucial week, the days of her generation essentially ended.<br/><br/>There's a symbolic fourteen-point stag at Balmoral the men are interested in. James Cromwell's brusque, lordly Prince Philip will do nothing but take the boys hunting, to get them outside. In the end a corporate banker kills the stag on a neighbor's property, and only Elizabeth sees it, when she's stranded in a jeep she's driven into the mud, and crying.<br/><br/>For all its ceremony and noise, loneliness and wit, mostly The Queen simply tells a story, the new story of English royalty at the end of the twentieth century. It was a story worth telling, and it's told well."

A Truly Moving Picture ""¬Öexplores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.<br/><br/>Normally I am careful not to give away the ending of a movie in a comment. In this case, the story and the ending are already known. In 1997, Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris trying to escape from the paparazzi. This was about a year after her divorce with Prince Charles. Great Britain and the world mourned her loss in a surprisingly large way. It was as if Princess Diana was an assassinated world political or spiritual leader.<br/><br/>The royal family did not initially react to her death in a human or sensitive way. They alternately said it was a private affair or Princess Diana was no longer royalty since the divorce or we are protecting Princess Diana's two sons or let us grieve alone. But, they were coming off as cold and standoffish to the English people and they were causing the monarchy system to become unpopular and even despised. In steps the new young Prime Minister, Tony Blair, influences Queen Elizabeth II to mourn in public and bring a humanity to the English monarchy.<br/><br/>The real story is the journey of Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II to get to this final destination.<br/><br/>It is hard to separate what is fact and what is made-up in this film. Many facts are certain because you see historical footage of the bunches of cut flowers growing in front of Buckingham Palace and the then President Clinton making a statement and many clips of Princess Diane throughout her life. But the many behind-the-scenes conversations had to be invented or recalled, so it has to be part fiction and part fact.<br/><br/>The monarchy is not treated kindly in this film. Prince Philip comes off as insensitive and a bearer of grudges. Prince Charles appears to be weak. Queen Elizabeth II, played brilliantly by Helen Mirren, comes off as reserved and complicated. And Tony Blair, played convincingly by Michael Sheen, trumps the royalty by being real and wise and likable.<br/><br/>The storytelling is compelling. Even though you know what will happen, you are intrigued by how the characters get to their ultimate positions.<br/><br/>In the end, Queen Elizabeth II and Tony Blair display a profound love for their country. It is really a story about public dignitaries trying to do the right thing for their country and their families.<br/><br/>FYI ¬ñ There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where you can find a listing of past Crystal Heart Award winners as well as other Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."

","What an amazing Film; Mirren should get an Oscar and Blair was brilliantly portrayed too but best of all was the cinematography - the highlands, the stag - transcendental and wonderfully conceived and executed. Best film I've seen in ages. It perfectly portrayed the balance between the traditionalist monarchy on the one hand and the new modernising labour government on the other. The dialogue between the main protagonists was excellent and there were also some wonderful one-liners; ""tell him to hang on"" in reference to a 'phone call from Gordon Brown was the one I enjoyed the best.

","There is no way of knowing, of course, just how authentic is Peter Morgan's very fine script for this account of what may or may not have taken place in the household of HRH during the days, chiefly between the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and her funeral, as it is unlikely that those involved would have blurted out to Morgan what they probably consider to be state secrets. No, Morgan's script is pure conjecture, a fiction about real events lent a considerable degree of seeming 'authenticity' by director Stephen Frears handling of the material and use of documentary footage mainly taken from the television programmes of the day. Should we condemn him, then, for guessing what conversations may have occurred in private between the Queen and her Prime Minister? Certainly not, anymore than we should condemn James Goldman for being fanciful as to what may or may not have occurred in the Court of Henry 11 and Eleanor of Aquitaine.<br/><br/>""The Queen"", then, is not some purposeful account of the facts surrounding the death of Princess Diana as seen from the Royal, (and Prime Ministerial), perspective as a wonderfully human comedy hewn from a national and a private tragedy. And at it's heart, and what really makes it work, is a devastatingly accurate study, not simply of a Monarch we all feel we 'know' from endless television footage, but of a deeply private woman struggling to maintain her own personal dignity in the midst of immense public scrutiny, and Helen Mirren's performance is really quite extraordinary. She has the looks and the mannerisms off pat but more significantly she cuts to the quick of the private individual and unearths the human being inside the Queen. This is great acting which I have no doubt will be rewarded with every prize going come the year's end, (and anyone unfamiliar with Mirren's work who thinks, perhaps, that this is largely just a brilliant piece of mimicry should seek out her very different but equally brilliant performance on television as the present Queen's namesake Elizabeth 1).<br/><br/>The biggest glittering prize most likely to come Mirren's way is, of course, the Oscar and amid the ballyhoo surrounding her performance, Michael Sheen's brilliant turn as Tony Blair has been mostly overlooked. Sheen, too, gives an award-worthy turn as our present Prime Minister, again capturing, not just the look and the mannerisms, but also the arrogance that comes with youth and success and, more importantly, the humility that finally comes with understanding. Sheen gets closer to the 'real' Blair in those moments when he isn't saying anything at all.<br/><br/>Neither Alex Jennings nor James Cromwell look anything Princes Charles and Philip but they manage to capture the essence of the men. (Jennings is particularly good at getting that vacant look of Charles' that says to many people, 'Is there anyone at home?'). And there's a lovely, beautifully understated performance by Roger Allam as the Queen's Private Secretary.<br/><br/>Of course, it is almost as unlikely we will ever know what the people portrayed in the film think of it as it is we will ever know how close Mirren has come to 'getting it right' but I defy anyone to condemn the film on the grounds of either taste or accuracy. What matters isn't how real this film is, (it isn't a documentary, after all), but how closely those involved have come to capturing the hearts and minds of the people on the screen. Judged on this basis, ""The Queen"" is an unqualified triumph."
"WriterDave","8","84","135","9 October 2006"," Paparazzi Kissed the Princess
","The paparazzi kissed the princess that fateful week in 1997, but all the English people wanted was their Queen. Stephen Frears' competent, well written, expertly cast and intimate look into the Royal Family and British government in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death is a straightforward, no-nonsense stunner.<br/><br/>Operating both as a comedy of manners where the newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair (an excellent Michael Sheen) must save the Royal Family from themselves before the Monarchy is tossed aside completely by an angry, guilt-ridden public desperately wanting a statement, a word of comfort, or at very least the presence in London of their Queen Elizabeth II (played masterfully by Helen Mirren, who is as cold and stubborn here as she was conflicted and passionate as Elizabeth I in the HBO miniseries of the same name earlier this year), and also as a surprisingly touching testament to the British people's love affair with Princess Diana and more importantly the Monarchy, ""The Queen"" succeeds splendidly on multiple levels.<br/><br/>Frears combines archival footage of a grieving public and newscasts with intertwining splices of historical recreations and fictionalized riffs on what it must've been like inside the Royal Chambers. The writers get the mannerisms of the Royals down perfect, as people with stiff upper lips who declare their outrage with words like ""quite"" and ""that's not how it's done!"" One miscalculation is when the writers try to create a connection between Blair's love for his deceased mother and his newfound sense of protectionism over Elizabeth. It's only surface level, and Freudian, and seems rather out of place in an otherwise totally British film. The rest of the Royals serve as a sideshow, with Prince Charles wimpy and ineffective in the presence of his mother, Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) a rowdy lout, and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Sims) providing equal parts comic relief and aristocratic wisdom to her daughter.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Queen"" is a film that sneaks up on you, funnier and more touching than you imagined, and anchored by a classic turn from a consummate British actress as a Queen who desires to understand her people and do them proud while honoring the traditions of her lineage."

","I have never been a particular fan of the Royals, nor indeed of the monarchy itself. I also felt the mass hysteria that overloaded and in many ways out shone Princess Diana's death was of the most hypocritical kind in regards to a guilty media, and outrageously superfluous on behalf of a needy public. Yes, that week was truly a memorable one if you lived in Britain and owned a television set because you couldn't fail to be engulfed in the bleeding heart hysteria that followed on from Diana's untimely demise. <br/><br/>""The Queen,"" sifts through that week of high drama to tell an elegant and quintessentially British story about our values and our expectations of the family people love to hate. Helen Mirren looks every inch The Queen of England and quite exceptionally captures a portrayal of the woman by investing her with a heartfelt dignity, conviction and humanity, that the real Queen should be nothing less than flattered by. Mirren secured herself that Oscar the moment production wrapped; she is truly sensational, carrying us through the whole movie with a grace we rarely see on the big screen these days. Michael Sheen is also to be praised for his uncanny impression of Tony Blair, although he scratches deeper than just surface imitation and digs deep to unearth the once idealistic, and seemingly honourable Prime Minister in the early days of his premiership. Support also comes courtesy of a terrific James Cromwell who adds that light touch of comic relief in the role of Prince Philip, while Mark Bazeley as Alistair Campbell reminds audiences how instrumentally devious a spin doctor can be. Every performance is spot on and helps do justice to the brilliantly written script by Peter Morgan who somehow has drawn to light the different sides involved in that week of tragedy and media spin without being too intrusive in terms of the grief of Princes William and Harry, while Stephen Frears never turns the stock footage of Diana into something overly ghoulish or unseemly.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, this story is not really about Diana at all, her death merely serving as the catalyst for a deep and painful self-reflection for The Queen on her monarchy and personal aversion to Diana and the circus slowly gathering outside Buckingham palace. Further to that, the film is most sincerely, you could say almost whimsically, about the relationship between The Queen and Tony Blair, their differing views on modern Britain and the general public who populate it. I found myself seeing The Queen and Mr. Blair in quite new lights, putting more faith and respect in the decisions they made in that fateful week, and believing that solidarity, compromise and respect played a key role in laying Diana's memory to rest. It is also very amusing at times too, and when not tickling the ribs with a sardonic sideswipe by Prince Philip or a wry put down by The Queen Mother about Blair's ""Cheshire cat grin"" Morgan's script and Frears' controlled, beautifully unshowy direction combine to create the most tender and curious of scenes where The Queen encounters a lone stag in the wilds of her estate whilst at her weakest moment, and draws a strength from that rare meeting of beauty up-close. Another gem of a scene is where she is greeted by a little girl who is there not to simply pay her respects to the Princess of Wales, but to the Queen of England herself, with a bouquet of flowers. Very sweet, and very touching.<br/><br/>This truly is a strong piece of work, quite possibly one of the best films of its year, certainly as fine a British production that I have seen in some time. The characters are well drawn and strongly performed, the writing insightful and totally believable, while the warmth of the material makes me think I might start appreciating our Royal family just that little bit more. Certainly if The Queen's emotional wealth of character and strong, traditional values can survive and rise above cynical opportunism and media mined mass hysteria then I'm sure she can survive anything. But above all else ""The Queen,"" goes to show that no matter how unjustly wealthy, obnoxiously powerful or goofily out of touch the Royals may be, as a family unit they are just as complex, dysfunctional and quirky as any other family in Britain. This truly is a royal treat, please do believe the hype and don't let Her Majesty pass you by."

","i've had a few days to think about THE QUEEN, and i say without shame that this is a perfectly constructed film with the necessary bonus of a great ensemble cast. This has got to be the great, Helen Mirren's year, in spite of everything. She has now recreated both ElizabethR's, and does it like nobody else. Watching the solid and versatile James Cromwell playing her idiot, cousin-husband was also very good; and i mean no offense to staunch royalists. British history and particularly it's ancient monarchy is one of my passions, so i waited for the films' release with anticipation. It was a true treat seeing Ms Sylvia Syms playing the queen mum. There are brief comments made about the royal family which are less than complimentary but true. But Mr Frears doesn't dwell on them, points out Elizabeth's devotion to her country and to her tradition, without hitting us over the head with it. I loved his film, THE GRIFTERS. THE QUEEN is equally as good. Some of my fellow film fans feel that the magnificent stag, so relentlessly hunted for it's fourteen points, represented Diana. For me, it represented the entire royal family, and especially the Queen. I loved the opening quotation assessed to Henry 4, who basically usurped the throne from family with a better claim: ""uneasy is the head that wears the crown"", or something close to that, For him, it was. But he did his fair share of back stabbing himself to retain power. The scene with Helen and Sylvia consulting about what to do was especially powerful. it's quite true that Elizabeth is descended from a long, unbroken line which precedes the Norman conquest. As queen, she has, imo, done everything she can and more to fulfill her obligations and her birth right, putting her country before anything else. The weak and ineffectual Charles wasn't man enough to marry the woman he loved. Some may argue that he was doing ""his duty"", but if he was, he destroyed a few lives along the way. And i do believe that yes indeed, he would let his mother take a bullet for him. Not nice to say, and perhaps a tad unfair. Elizabeth, on the other hand, threatened to abdicate as heir presumptive if she couldn't marry Phillip. Then there are the references to George the sixth's demise, from the stress of being King when he wasn't up to it, nor groomed for it. Well, other Kings had older brothers die,such as his own father; one was even passed over in favour of a younger one; others seized it. I think his excessive smoking and depleted immune system from generations of cousin-marrying probably didn't help, since he died from emphysema. or so we're told. But i admired him, and i adored his wife, the late Queen Consort Elizabeth. Don't get me wrong; i really feel no moral criticism about cousins marrying; but i do believe in hybrid vitality. And then there's the Hapsburgs! Her relationship with Tony Blair was believable and quite likely very close to the truth. I do believe i recently watched Mr. Sheen portray the insane emperor Nero... This is a glorious, tasteful film with an unbelievable performance by Helen Mirren. It may not be everybody's ""cup of tea"", but it is a gem. *I wish i could have had a better look at those portraits hanging behind The Queen. There were her grandparents, her great grandparents, and Victoria, i believe, who was her great great great grandmother...spectacular collection of art and portraits...some were cut off at the waist, headless..like that magnificent stag...."
"JamesHitchcock","7","14","21","11 October 2006"," Howling Hysterical Sorrow
","At the time of Princess Diana's funeral I remember thinking that, instead of rewriting ""Candle in the Wind"", Elton John should simply have performed a song from ""Evita""- the one that asks the questions ""Why all this howling hysterical sorrow? What kind of goddess has lived among us? How will we ever get by without her?"" Tim Rice's lyrics were, of course, originally written about Eva Peron, but they could equally well have been written about the British public's over-reaction to Diana's death.<br/><br/>Those sentiments were not popular ones in September 1997, but they should not be taken as implying that I have any particular axe to grind against either the Monarchy in general or Diana in particular. Republicanism is simply another manifestation of our regrettable tendency to jump on American bandwagons (in this particular case two hundred years too late), and I have always thought that King Charles III and Queen Diana might have made a formidable Royal couple. Charles the Head, with his intellectual interests in spirituality and the environment, and Diana the Heart, with her spontaneous human warmth and touch of sex appeal, could both have brought qualities to the Monarchy which it has sometimes lacked in the past. Unfortunately, their wildly contrasting characters, which could have made them such a great Royal team had they been able to avoid washing their dirty linen in public, made it impossible for them to live together as a married couple. The woman we buried on that September morning nine years ago was no longer Our Future Queen but rather the dead mistress of a millionaire Egyptian playboy.<br/><br/>This film is not about the life of Diana (there is a great film to be made on that subject, but it has not yet been made and probably will not be for a number of years). Nor does it attempt to analyse exactly why her death should have provoked such hysteria, including not only hysterical sorrow but also hysterical anger against the Royal Family. I suspect that the main culprit was the media which, exercising the harlot's privilege of power without responsibility, had over the years built Diana into (to borrow another phrase from ""Evita"") ""a cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint"". The press found itself under criticism when the paparazzi in its employ were implicated in her death, and needed to divert the public's anger onto a new target. Given, however, the incestuous interdependence of the media world, where press barons own shares in television and film companies, film-makers are often reluctant to subject the Fourth Estate to too much scrutiny.<br/><br/>This is, rather, an examination of the relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and her Prime Minister Tony Blair and of the roles played by them in the events following Diana's death. The two are sharply contrasted, but the contrast is not one of ideology. The Queen is constitutionally obliged to remain politically impartial and Blair, who moved New Labour into the centre ground and away from its traditional attachment to Socialism and class-based politics, is probably less likely to harbour anti-monarchist sentiments than many earlier Labour politicians. (The Old Labour republicanism attributed to Cherie Blair in this film looks very old-fashioned). Rather, the contrast between them is that between differing temperaments and, even more, between different generations.<br/><br/>The Queen is the representative of the older generation, a believer in tradition, in dignity and emotional restraint. She sees no need to rush back to London from Scotland (the Royal Family traditionally spend late summer on their Balmoral estate) or to fly the Union Jack at half-mast over Buckingham Palace. (Tradition decrees that only the Royal Standard, which denotes the presence of the Monarch and is never flown at half-mast, can fly over the Palace). She is sympathetic to the Spencer family's wish that Diana should be given a private funeral. Blair, on the other hand, represents the younger generation- he is a believer in innovation and change rather than tradition and more sensitive to the public mood. His politician's instincts tell him that the Royal Family's attitude represents a public relations disaster in the making, and tries to persuade the Queen to return to London, to fly the flag and to grant Diana the official funeral for which the public are clamouring.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen bears a close resemblance to the Tony Blair of nine years ago, and has clearly studied him closely in order to catch his every gesture and nuance. I was not, however, particularly impressed by his performance. He seemed to have fallen into the trap of watching his subject too closely, becoming a mimic rather than an actor. I felt that I was watching an impressionist of the Mike Yarwood or Rory Bremner school impersonating Blair rather than an actor playing him in a serious drama. Some of the members of the Royal Family, such as James Cromwell's Prince Philip and Sylvia Syms's Queen Mother, seemed one-dimensional figures, based upon popular preconceptions rather than any attempt to create rounded characters. Alex Jennings's Prince Charles was rather contradictory; at times he seemed the most sympathetic of the Royals, at others weak and cowardly.<br/><br/>By far the best performance came from Helen Mirren as the Queen. In the past she has chosen some rather dubious vehicles for her undoubted talent (notoriously ""Caligula""), but this is one of her most assured performances of recent years. Her Elizabeth II emerges as a very human and sympathetic individual as she and Blair, despite their many differences, discover a growing respect for one another's point of view. In many ways, this subject would have been more suitable for a TV drama than a cinema release. Mirren, however, always makes it worth watching. 7/10"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","10","14","21 October 2008"," Queen Helen Mirren
","Frears brilliantly recreates that royal events surrounding the tragic and sudden death of the people of England's beloved princess. The focus is on the royal family, particularly Queen Elizabeth and what may have gone in her mind during this ordeal. Frears attempts to give an impartial view of the event and sticks to the main point. He cleverly uses live footage of the late princess and combines it within the film. The cinematography and quick cuts are very effective. Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen give standout performances. No doubt it must have been difficult to play both parts but the two actors pull it off without hassle. Even as Queen Elizabeth (one of the most unsexiest queen), Mirren looks sexy and not in a way that distracts the viewer from the character. It's remarkable how she so accurately displays the nuances of the title character. I'm glad that Michael Sheen finally got a role to display his wonderful acting abilities. James Cromwell and Sylvia Sims are equally good in their roles respectively as the Queen's husband and mother. Helen McCrory makes Cherie Blair look pretty. My only small complaint is that, the film, at times, moves at a very slow pace but otherwise this is a well made movie that gives a glimpse of how the tragic event might have affected the royal family."
"Chris_Docker","8","14","24","18 September 2006"," Rare insights and an emotionally rewarding film
","Imagine for a moment you are newly elected landslide Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and your modernising beliefs don't really welcome obeisance to an outdated monarchy. Princess Diana dies, and the nation turns with venomous tooth and claw (aided perhaps by a certain spin doctor) against the Royals. A golden opportunity? But Blair feels there is something unseemly about tearing the Queen to bits and, in the middle of the crisis, kicks in some damage control.<br/><br/>This is the dynamic of power that bounces back and forth, aided by shrewish asides from Cherie Blair (""Off to see the girlfriend, then?"") and her hilarious curtsy that manages to be respectful while still taking the p*ss. Delivering a sparkly dialogue and an especially witty battle between monarch and minister, director Stephen Frears' central accomplishment still has to be casting Helen Mirren as the Queen. No hard-line royalist, Mirren has said she thought twice before accepting her honours as a Dame of the British Empire in 2003, but her portrait here is convincingly astute, supporting a remarkable physical transformation with a sensitive characterisation that endears the Queen to us and renders her majesty's charisma all the more apparent.<br/><br/>In an early scene where the Queen is chatting to her portrait artist, she mentions the coming election and expresses a longing to vote, just once, for ""the sheer joy of being partial."" The artist reminds her that it is, after all, her government, and Queen Elizabeth retorts, ""Yes, I suppose that's some consolation."" Obviously there's some things money can't buy.<br/><br/>The film examines her character, her stoical dignity born of years of tolerance not of her choosing, and is maybe so gripping because previous portraits have been little more than a regal cipher. At the end, we feel that we have been privy to the private life of a person who, like her or not, is a feature of everyone's life in the UK. It maybe lacks the grandeur that is traditionally associated with the Queen, but is nevertheless a fairly sympathetic portrait. When Blair tells her how her ratings have dropped to an all time low, she is genuinely upset that she has failed to read her public - to whom she has devoted her life. The film, with all its light-hearted touches, maybe even assists the process of 'modernisation' that the Monarchy now believes is inevitable.<br/><br/>Much of the power in the performances is from unexpressed emotion. All the players are in such important positions that displays of feeling are usually taboo, publicly and sometimes privately as well. After her husband takes her grandchildren stag hunting to 'take their mind off things', the Queen is privately close to shedding a tear for the stag. A moment in the Balmoral countryside when she is alone with the creature reveals a sense of wonder in her that she cannot communicate to the human companions of her world, and she visits the body of the beast (when it is later killed by a neighbour) with more alacrity than she feels towards a dead daughter-in-law who has been her near ruin. Diana, in life, was perhaps also isolated, and we are reminded of her devotion to causes such as banning land-mines - causes to which she could unleash her emotion and, fortunately for her, to which the public could also identify.<br/><br/>The film evokes strong feelings - not least in bringing back the sense of national mourning that followed Diana's death (actual footage is used and the moments leading to the car crash are movingly re-created) even if this goes on to an almost sugary excess. Add to that the crisis of feelings within the Royal Family itself, the sense of isolation felt by the Queen, and the release of the film near the end of Blair's career, and you have a movie that presents a whirlwind of emotion that will thrill public tastes."

","In 1997, after the death of Lady Di in a car accident in Paris, the reluctant Queen (Helen Mirren) and The Establishment do not accept to honor the ""People's Princess"" as a member of the Royal Family. However, the public and the media question the utility of the monarchy and the just-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) advises the Queen to make a public speech mourning the loss of Diana.<br/><br/>""The Queen"" is probably the best performance of Helen Mirren in the cinema. This film reconstitutes the days after the death of Lady Di, showing the conservative and cold behavior of the Royal Family, and how the people questioned the reason for being of the parasite monarchy. Stephen Frears entwines archive footages with his filming and the result is a good movie, especially for those viewers that followed carefully those days. I am not sure whether the attention (and grieving) of the Queen with the stag shot by a guest is real or fictional to know whether this scene was manipulative or really happened, but it is very impressive. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Rainha"" (""The Queen"")"

","I'm impressed. The movie is good, and truthful. I'm not to judge how close to the truth were Balmoral scenes, but behavior of public and tabloids was perfectly recreated.<br/><br/>Warning, SPOILERS ahead.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful. Hellen Mirren as Her Majesty The Queen and Michael Sheen as labor Prime Minister Tony Blair are as good as perfect. During the Queen's speech to the nation on live TV I wasn't able to determine if it was Mirren's voice, or the real Queen speaking. Often I found myself thinking that I'm watching archive material from that period's news, but then it turned out that the actors recreated everything! Wow! Both of them carry the movie and Mirren's award from Venice is well deserved. What's interesting, is that there are practically no right or wrong sides of the conflict here. At the beginning Blair is trying to mate with the public, but realizing that by doing this he undermines the monarchy, he is trying to correct the error. The Queen is keeping her ground, not bending to the tabloids demanding royal tributes paid to Diana (lower the royal flag on the mast above the Buckingham Palace, go back to London, live TV speech to the nation ¬ñ something that wasn't done even when the previous king died!); while the Queen wishes to keep the matter private, to deal with it as a family, not The Royal Family, because Diana was no longer a part of it. The ending is very straightforward. Ironically, each side is presenting the other's point of view: Blair is bashing his adviser demanding respect for the Queen and talking about all the sacrifices she had to commit. The Queen is pointing out to Blair why he had changed his attitude and prophets the same treating from tabloids as the one she got. The most powerful scene for me was the one when the Queen returns to Buckingham Palace and takes a walk by the gate, looking at the flowers and cards left there by the public. No one really realized until now, that the Queen really must have seen what was written on these cards! And I felt ashamed¬Ö ""Diana, you were too good for them"" or ""Your blood is on their hands"". There are fragments of interviews with Diana where she indirectly accuses the Queen of what bad had happened to her. Only today I realized, that Diana was attacking a person unable to defend herself! We don't really expect the Queen to appear on Jonathan Ross' to present her part of the story, do we? And there is a second face of this coin. The subplot of hunting and killing of a deer is script writer's comment on the monarchy. And a prophecy - very sad, at that. I know that it makes this movie a little bit more fictional, but the message had to be sent.<br/><br/>I loved it. Made me realize something that I thought I knew ¬ñ the Queen is a living and breathing person. And that Diana was not the only victim of the media then. So was the Queen, and the monarchy."

","I'm very worried that some people might think this movie is a faithful depiction of recent history.<br/><br/>IT IS NOT.<br/><br/>What we have is a series of set pieces where some fairly good actors deliver lines of fiction. I am no apologist for the Royal Family but I am concerned that people may watch this film and, mistakenly, think they are being allowed to see what goes on behind the scenes at the Royal palaces and Downing Street. This is simply not the case.<br/><br/>The news reels are true and the beauty of the Scottish scenery is true but the rest is just made up. No one knows what the Queen and the Prime Minister discussed after Di's death and I would have preferred this to have been made clear at the start of the movie.<br/><br/>It struck me that the film was target at the US audience who watched this unfold at a distance. That may explain some of the clunky dialogue: Tony Blair: ""Who is he?"" Assistant (holding phone): ""He's the Lord Chancellor - you're on your way to meet him at the airport."" Come on. Massive signpost anyone? <br/><br/>Viewers outside the UK may not know that the Stephen Frears/Michael Sheen partnership have been seen before in a very successful UK television drama where Sheen played the part of Blair. Just because someone can do a decent impersonation of the British prime minister does not appear adequate justification for making a 97 minute film.<br/><br/>As I left the cinema I tried to work out why the film had been made. Couldn't come up with a single good reason."

","This is a poor film, with poor acting all round with the exception of Mirren. People will like and watch this film because of the event it centres around, and for the same inexplicable reason so many people felt her loss as if one of their own, they will stamp their ego on this movie and claim to love it. Self delusion I'm afraid, it's terrible. Diana's death illustrates the lengths people will go to in an apathetic and ideological direction-less world to feel something and unite. I believe this to be backward and insulting to countless other hard working heroes who go unsung everyday whilst helping the people of this world. This film possibly documents the UK's turning point to obsession rather than enamour with celebrity. It also documents the sad point in which Diana's mourners are not told to get it together and take stock of their own lives, but pandered to by political opportunists and a glutinous media. Ironically this film has the same air of apathy in its script and production that must have been sweeping the nation prior to the accident, for only apathy could incite the desperate and pathetic grief competition that arose after that inane night. If I seem to talk more about the event than the movie, that's because there's not much to talk about regarding the movie.

She really becomes the Queen that we all know and love because she blends into the role so well that it's nearly impossible to think of her as the same person who played Jane Tennison, a Titanic Survivor in the S.O.S. Titanic. I admired Sylvia Syms and think she should become a Dame herself. James Cromwell is great as Prince Phillip and should get a Best Supporting Actor nomination as well. I can't forget Sylvia and think she deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination as well. Stephen Frears really deserves nominations for recreating a week that was well unforgettable because it was so painful. I always knew that the Royals were real decent people with flaws and problems of their own. It's hard to imagine them as anything other than the caricatures that the British tabloid press make them out to be. The Royals have lived in a fishbowl their entire lives and will do so.

The Queen mother was shown as a common gin swilling old sot, the Prince Philip character could have come straight out of 'Allo 'Allo Tony Blair impersonation was fair and Helen Mirren was good as the Queen. Camera work reminded me of a home movie at times and you would think they could get some facts right for instance it has been common knowledge for several decades that the Queen doesn't share her bed with Phil the Greek, is it likely that the Queen would drive anywhere without her protection squad observing? The Queen would not have made such a base error as referring to the Union Flag as the Union Jack This is just soap opera dressed up as history with speculation and minus facts"

I was very disappointed with the Queen and here are the reasons why I didn't think it was much above average.<br/><br/>There was a television movie feel about it. I'm not sure just what I was expecting but this felt very much at times like a TV movie. It also seemed like so much of The Queen was less about Lady Diana or The Queen then about Tony Blair. I expected the film to open with the day Lady Diana was killed only it didn't. This seemed, at times, more Blaire's story then Diana's or The Queen's. And a lot of the movie just wasn't very interesting frankly. It didn't hook me in or the person I saw this with.<br/><br/>I also felt it was a bit to talky. The music in the film was enthralling so to bad it wasn't used enough. I generally like talky films but with this one, it was just TO talky. So many scenes went on and on about the same thing. And that would have been fine if I felt I was watching The Royal Family but I didn't. I didn't feel like I was watching the royal family. With the exception of Helen Mirron who is always extraordinary, nobody really jumped out at me and I never felt the performers were the people they were playing.The actor who played Charles didn't even look much like him. Sometimes it just didn't seem authentic. I did enjoy Mirron as the queen but as far as an Oscar goes I will be happy if she wins because I always like her work but I'd still give it to Judy Dench for ""Notes On A Scandel"". Her character still haunted me for days after I saw the film. With The Queen, it really didn't stay with me afterward. Still, the best thing about the movie by far was Mirron who is definitely an amazing actress.<br/><br/>Also the movie moved very slowly and there wasn't a lot of intensity about much of it and there should have been. Sometimes I felt Diana was a backdrop to the relationship between Blair and the Queen. Perhaps I didn't fully understand what this was going to be about. But the movie just wasn't as powerful as I imagined it to be from the previews.<br/><br/>This all being said, I can understand why it's up for an Oscar because it does have Mirron and it seems like the kind of film that would be nominated. But for me this is a 5 or 6 and although I'd watch it again if someone I know wanted to see it, I will admit it would be very hard for me to get through it a second time as It wasn't exactly easy the first time. There are a lot of positive comments on this movie, way more then negative ones so perhaps I missed a few things and just didn't get it but this was a let down and just about average for me."

It felt to me like yet another docudrama of the Royals, with cardboard predictability in all the characters except Elizabeth and just-call-me-Tony.<br/><br/>How much more interesting would this film have been had it shown with far greater detail the entire history of the complicated relationship between Elizabeth and Diana, instead of just the week surrounding her death.

That beginning bit begins withe her being imaged for public exposure and then looking directly at the camera as if to say: this, this is the portrait of me.<br/><br/>She is one of two queens in the story, the other being the ghost of Diana who is shown only in reference and only in public exposure.<br/><br/>The official queen is shown at home, watching TeeVee, and frumping around the estate. The story is a rather gauzy one. Part of it is the delving into deviance of (usually English) society, the one thing Frears does well in the middle of his movies. In this case we see the inexplicable business of a monarchy which exists solely to keep a national story suspended. The story is threatened and some sort of a national crisis is averted. Its engaging because every viewer will have lived through that period and this gives peeks into corners we may have wondered about at the time.<br/><br/>A second component of the movie is the supposed examination of character of this woman, and the huzzas that Mirren gets for her portrayal. We celebrate the performance only because the movie as a whole works. I can think of a dozen Mirren performances that are better suited to celebration. Ho hum. We see her grieve more for an animal than for Diana, act more out of fear than honor. We see Blair ¬ó our designated observer in the story ¬ó superficially evolve.<br/><br/>A third component has to do with the introspection in the thing. And that is the only bit I can recommend (other than the opening which it supports). The deal is all about story. Nations require a story so they can know who they are. The Brits aren't the most ridiculous people on the planet, but they are the ones who have most explored the foibles of their own national story in their art, so their introspection makes them appear more silly than the rest of us.<br/><br/>That national story includes the necessity of actors, so they hire a few nitwits to dress up and pretend to be monarchs. They are simply actors, no more. So the deal with this film is that we have an actress, Mirren, playing an actress who examines her role. Its a meaty opportunity and thank god we didn't get Dench, who I suppose would have been shoehorned in if not for her appearance. And it isn't that Mirren isn't intelligent enough to be an actor that shows how acting works. But Frears isn't interested and Mirren's style is more about showing her commitment to the role rather than exploring our commitment to it.<br/><br/>But that opening. Excellent.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","I was in England when Blair was elected. The sentiment was very much the same as it was in the U.S. when Clinton came to power, a young, vital man ushering in a new age of idealism and renewal (I'm convinced now that we'll have this once every 20 or so years until the end of time, or elections). It's interesting to note that Peter Morgan is now working on a Bill Clinton script.<br/><br/>I didn't love this film though. Thought Mirren was good, thought the same of Sheen. I was disappointed by the Frears/Morgan commentary on the DVD. I expected a little more from two very intelligent men.<br/><br/>It's hard to grasp as an American how consumed British culture is with royal goings on. It's an integral part of their ethos, so maybe that's why the film didn't completely grip me. I found most interesting the notion of the decline of civility and ""quiet dignity"" in favor of the loud, raw truth of liberalism.<br/><br/>Elizabeth II is an intriguing figure and I wish some other aspects of her life and the life of her country were explored. She lived through WWII, stood watch as Britain transformed from empire to commonwealth, oversaw its decline into relative global impotence. She watched as it appropriated elements of American pop culture and liberalism which shook her existence to the core -- this woman is a relic, a symbol, a grotesque waste of money. I wish Frears/Morgan had addressed these issues more than the family dynamic, which barely held my interest."
"fwomp","5","5","7","27 December 2006"," Is It a Hit? Or a Miss?
","Sometimes it's a hit or miss with directors, and with Stephen Frears at the helm the odds of a film being a success versus failure are about fifty/fifty. He has given us some excellent cinema such as High Fidelity, Dangerous Liaisons, and The Grifters. But sometimes his movie eye misses the mark or lacks an intriguing or well-rounded story. Mrs. Henderson Presents, Mary Reilly, and Hero are just a sprinkling of Frear films that had a good shot at being great, but ultimately failed in coherency, pacing, or some other aspect.<br/><br/>THE QUEEN is certainly a film with some great acting. Helen Mirren is spot-on as Queen Elizabeth II, as was Michael Sheen in his portrayal of Tony Blair. But from here the cast sags quite a bit. James Cromwell picked up the part of Prince Philip, but seemed very out of place since he has been typecast in such things as The West Wing TV series and The Sum of All Fears flick. And Sylvia Syms (as The Queen Mother) and Alex Jennings (as Prince Charles) were difficult to see in their respective roles since they are still in the public eye. Although Queen Elizabeth is still in the spotlight, Helen Mirren's strong portrayal made that role much easier to swallow.<br/><br/>Fresh subjects are tough to hit upon anyway, and you have to give credit where it is due; Stephen Frears certainly deserves some acclaim for simply attempting to make a film about the Royal Family and their reaction (or non-reaction) to Princess Diana's accidental death. But herein lies another problem: plot. There isn't one. The Queen is a reactionary tale, focusing mainly on Queen Elizabeth and the newly installed Prime Minister Tony Blair, and how each of them views the country's response to Di's death. Of course, the Queen deals with it by not dealing with it. While Mr. Blair continually tries to save the monarchy from self-destructing due to their own ignorance of the peoples' grief. But there isn't a definitive beginning, middle and ending to the story. It's character study of the monarchy will probably be boring to many, especially in the beginning. Most viewers may feel like dozing off after the first twenty minutes of disinteresting royal uppityness.<br/><br/>Although the beginning and middle of the film lag, the ending picks up just enough to make it watchable. The excellent shots of Balmoral Castle and its Scottish surroundings were fairly awesome, as were some analogies regarding the royal deer that roam the outback wildlands.<br/><br/>If you enjoy a good modern day character study, and are interested in the current monarchy, you'll probably eat this film up. But if you're eager for something plot-driven and deeply intriguing, you best look elsewhere."

","I am British and I arrived in Paris to settle here the weekend that Princess Diana died. I spent my first week watching news of the aftermath in the French press and TV. So this movie, apart from anything else, showed me the events through the British media for the first time. Like everyone else, I watched the funeral on television and was riveted by Di's brother's speech which seemed then and now to be Shakespearean in its drama, summing up the tension between her and the royal family's claim on the public's loyalty. ""I come to praise Diana, not to bury her..."" <br/><br/>Peter Watson and Stephen Frears have made an excellent movie and Helen Mirren doesn't need my endorsement for her spectacular performance. (I saw Penelope Cruz in Volver not long ago and the fight for the actress's Oscar is going to be epic this year). I was struck by the wonderful pacing of the plot and would credit the music score for a good deal of that.<br/><br/>My emotional engagement with the movie was unusually high. I was close to tears a lot of the time, especially towards the end. This leads me to speculate about why. I think the key is something Shakespeare and Walter Scott knew well, that the audience will be on the edge of their seats when the drama concerns events in recent history they have lived through themselves. (The best movie example of this I know is Oliver Stone's Nixon.) Society is very mysterious to us and we don't normally have access to its effects on us. But when the actors are Princess Di the most famous woman in the world, Queen Elizabeth and her dysfunctional family, Tony Blair and his power crazy New Labour henchmen (a withering portrayal of press secretary, Alistair Campbell), we see society as we lived it a decade ago personified through them and it gives us a window on ourselves.<br/><br/>To take one scene, the Queen returns to Buckingham Palace to find crowds of people and flowers (some with very unkind messages attached). A little girl gives her some flowers of her own and a line of women curtsy in traditional deference as she walks along. I found myself snuffling at this point. Why? I am not a monarchist, far from it. I want the whole lot out. But I have absorbed so much of British society in intangible ways and that scene showed me what I must struggle against if I want to change it.<br/><br/>There is no question that Queen Elizabeth is immensely reinforced by this movie. She wins, in a manner of speaking. But the future of the monarchy after she goes is uncertain. It becomes clear that she personifies the refusal of the British people to come to terms with their loss of empire and indeed lost greatness. She is the hair of the dog for their long post-imperial hangover. The British people have changed in her lifetime. They are more sentimental, less stoical than before. Maybe one day soon they will wake up from the nostalgia she represents. Maybe Blair's fall from grace, foretold by the Queen at the end of this movie, will be one catalyst for that."

","Be warned. I saw this movie in a sneak preview so it was no disappointment, it was an annoyance. There is no story to be told, but what everyone read in every newspaper in 1997 when Diana died. There is no artistic distance to the history, even newscasts from this time are cut in. The camera is far below TV quality, even when they get into the fantastic Scottish highlands. Only bad actors have been casted for this barbiturate, well, except Helen Mirren. Or they are fine actors, but the director did not know what to do with them. At least, he did not know what for - just to have Mrs. Mirren in a role, where she can play a lot of extras with her gazes. The characters are compromised ore underdeveloped. The filmmakers had obviously no idea, not a vision, but eyes filled with tears, not being able to look at, what needed to be done: artificial access."

","It's 1997. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) and the Labour Party have just won a landslide victory. Then Princess Diane is killed in a Paris tunnel.

Eventually the pressure becomes too overwhelming and the Royals must change with the times.<br/><br/>There are two great performances in this. There is also an interesting personal drama within this international story. The death of a princess may not be important in the grand scheme of it all, but it provides a backdrop for a compelling personal drama. Michael Sheen seems to be the guy to play Tony Blair. He's great at it. Helen Mirren is exceptional. She brings both the stoic and the scared with such ease. She fully deserves the Oscar for best actress."

However, there is more to this film than just one excellent performance.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is superb. The settings and costumes are gorgeous. And the blending of actual news footage and the modern cast is almost without a hitch. <br/><br/>The film also tries to be very fair and balanced. It does not portray the royal family as evil, greedy schemers or Diana as a saint. It shows that everyone is human; we all have our bad points as well as our good. The Queen tries very hard to do the ""proper"" thing, but it is in conflict with what might be the ""best"" thing for her people.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent film that anyone who likes British history or the royal family should watch."

","... is the only word for Helen Mirren - though 'regal' is good as well. It's a great shame that The Queen cannot play in a double bill with Valerie Lemercier's Palais Royal which is a brilliant satire on Diana and the bewildering affect she had on the great unwashed public which constitutes a new definition of mass hypnosis. Consider: you're a reasonably personable young girl with the IQ of a Swiss cheese and someone makes you an offer; you can marry this rich, influential guy and wind up with wealth, the latest fashions, jewels, etc BUT; your husband will never love you, he's in love with someone else, has been for years and always will be. Okay, you accept the gig and THEN, a few years down the line start bitching that your husband doesn't love you - but STILL consoling yourself with, to paraphrase Noel Coward, the bitter palliative of wealth, status and adoration of the public. This, the inexplicable adoration and mass mourning, is rehashed yet again here and Mirren walks away with it yet bouquets to Helen McCrory who brings out the long streak of cow in Cherie Blair and has, in passing, one of the most outre' lines in the script when she, the Queen of freeloaders, accuses the Royal Family of being just that and 'nutters' to boot. It's doubtful whether Tony Blair would really have the decency to defend the Queen in private as eloquently and movingly - not to say correctly - as he does here but that's a minor beef. If Judi Dench can nab an Oscar for a twenty minute gig as Liz I then surely Mirren can do the same as Liz II."

","My girlfriend rented this film and I was unfortunate enough to watch it with her. While I have little interest in the British royal family, I knew the movie had received high praise. Understandably, I expected a lot. After watching this painful piece of cinema, I can honestly say this is a terribly boring, overrated film.<br/><br/>My sense is the film has been highly-rated because it cashes in on the bizarre, unjustified fascination with Princess Diana that exists even today. Honestly, she's just an average person who married into a life of extreme privilege without ever accomplishing anything on her own merits. She was able to do extensive charity work and jet-set around the world because she had little else to do with her time. I was never sure what made her so remarkable. The same goes for the rest of the royals. They are people born into privilege, simply given power without any qualification or reason. If these are the type of people that fascinate you endlessly, The Queen will seem like an amazing film.<br/><br/>I can only tolerate so many scenes of British royalty acting self-important. This movie is scene-after-scene of tedious, rigid dialog. At its core, The Queen is an empty story about empty people. It's not much more than a simplistic docudrama rehash of the controversy surrounding Diana's death. It also offers a very obvious illumination of the struggle between traditional British government and new British government.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a story that ascribes great importance and attention to people who just aren't all that interesting.

","The single aspect of 'The Queen' that enabled it to break out of the confines of TV drama originally envisaged for it into theatrical release is Helen Mirren's performance as Her Majesty. She combines powerfully the familiar and iconic image we have of the stoic, stern-faced and incorruptible monarch with an interpretation of what might be lying below the surface of that steely exterior. She plays it brilliant both for sympathy and comic effect in equal measure. The span of the film encompasses the remarkable and traumatic week that immediately followed the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, where the Queen arguably faced the greatest 'threat' to her reign, in the form of anger and disappointment at her apparent refusal to emote with the public over the loss of a very troubled (and troublesome) ex daughter-in-law. Whereas TV drama would focus on a forensic examination of the events and motivations, 'The Queen' goes further in placing this event in the context of the Queen's entire life, her assumptions and values and suggesting it forced her to re-evaluate her understanding of what 'The British People', which appears to be the single most valued relationship in her life, expect of her. Heavy stuff, but the film motors along nicely bouyed up by some delicious comedy (The Queen Mother having the details of Diana's funeral - bastardised from her own plans relayed to her) and dramatic tension focused on the exchanges between the ageing Queen and her insufferably young Prime Minister (call me Tony) which comes as close to brinkmanship as royal protocol allows. The portrayal of Blair by Michael Sheen, who also played him for Brown/Blair drama-documentary 'The Deal' is interesting. It has now de rigeur to portray Blair as opportunistic and unprincipled, but here he is used to represent a view which is broadly supportive of the monarchy as constitutional concept, but earnestly wishes it to 'modernise'. Back in 1997, with Blair elected on a wave of poopulism there was some genuine fear that the monarchy and the Royal Family specifically were in for a taste of some very radical modernisation down the line. Events proved otherwise, despite the odd ritual humiliation of the Queen having to sing Auld Langs Syne and play to a more politically correct agenda, the Palace has been left much alone. Some of the later dialogue has been given serendipitous irony as the 'Teflon Tony' of the film's period is now experiencing first-hand the true vagaries of popularity, with factions within his party now attempting to oust him as suddenly as the Queen predicts may happen to all leaders. It is highly likely she will still be around, as Queen, to ask his immediate successor and others whether they wish to form Her government."

How closely to the actual story is it and where does it diverge? I just don't know and I suspect very few do.<br/><br/>""The Queen"" is about a very brief period of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.

","The Queen is a British drama film directed by Stephen Frears, written by Peter Morgan, and starring Helen Mirren in the title role, Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Released almost a decade after the event, the film depicts a fictional account of the immediate events following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on 31 August 1997. Helen Mirren played Queen Elizabeth I together with Michael Sheen,James Cromwell,Helen McCrory,Alex Jennings,Roger Allam and Sylvia Syms.<br/><br/>The main plot focuses on the differing views in how to deal with the death of Diana. The Royal Family, while on their summer residence at Balmoral Castle, sees her death as a private affair, not to be treated as an official Royal death, in contrast with newly appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair and Diana's ex-husband Prince Charles, who attempt to reflect the public wish for an official expression of grief. Matters are further complicated by the media, royal protocol regarding Diana's official status, and wider issues about republicanism.<br/><br/>Full of wit, humor, and pathos, this moving portrait of the British royals during the period after Princess Diana's death features not one but two remarkable performances, that of Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and Michael Sheen as the newly-ordained Prime Minister Tony Blair. They embody their characters and lay bare the motivations behind these prominent people, giving viewers a glimpse into the inner workings of the British monarchy.This movie allows us to understand just how heavy the crown really sits and what is it like to be the Queen.In summary,it was an unqualified triumph that works on all levels."

Helen Mirren was so good that sometimes I had the feeling that this was a documentary and that Her Majesty herself was filmed.But above all I think this is a serious and responsible soul-searching of the British society in the 90s. Britain going on the coach to be released of its demons.

Michael Sheen was brilliant playing the role of Tony Blair, although his character is similar to a few of his other roles it worked really well in this one. The plot isn't something that gets the audience to care, maybe the Brits but I doubt they even care as well, unless your one of them that constantly shout ""God save the queen"".

""Plenty"" or ""Scandal"" which concern the upper crust in Britain, are richer, fuller experiences. I think even Caddyshack has more complexity (structurally) than most dramas these days.

Even my sainted grandmother thought QE2 was a guttersnipe for her chilly reaction to DI's death. Tony Blair's big scene (his conversion) is not adequate; Frears barely bothers to set it up.<br/><br/>The film seems to end, at which point a more conventional finish comes, which is a bit too pat and literal.

"glasslens","3","12","25","3 April 2007"," Forget the hype - this is simply not a good film.
","You've heard the hype, you've read about the Oscars. you've seen Helen Mirren on the TV. You've even read the reviews. You could be forgiven for having been brainwashed into thinking this was the best film of the year. But the sad truth is that the King's Magic Suit Of Cloths has been at work here - this is not a brilliant film, it is certainly not a great film, this is just a very ordinary film - a very ordinary film indeed. Now let's look at why this is. Firstly, the story. We all know it anyway - we lived through it and there are no surprises, no twists, no turns. It just rolls along, never deviating from the rather boring reality, because this film doesn't know if it supposed to be fact or fiction. I know Mirren is supposed to be some sort of National Treasure and I'm sure she is a very nice person, but a great actress she is not. In fact, she is the best of the bunch in this film - the rest are really just actors trying to be impressionists. You feel they are gladly taking their money but are rather embarrassed by what they are doing.<br/><br/>There is a big difference between being an impressionist and acting. Pretending to be Tony Blair by looking like him, speaking like him and adopting his mannerisms is not acting. If impressionists are the height of your artistic appreciation, that may be fine for you. Unfortunately the Mrs Blair character does not even manage to be an impression - just very very sadly comic (ho ho ho - she doesn't know quite how to curtsy!). Mirren may be made up to look a bit like the Queen but so what - any female impersonator could do that. And so it goes on - replaying what we already know, played by a bunch of impersonators, not having any sort of climax or decent ending at all really. In fact, it's all a bit pointless. If it was a ""made for TV"" this could have been a reasonable effort. As a ""big"" film, it is a poor effort - poor in concept, poor in achievement. If you watch the DVD and listen to the Directors commentary, what strikes you is how embarrassed he obviously is by the ""success"" his little film has achieved. That's about all you will get from the commentary - it's just two guy's chatting away for their own amusement, not caring a jot about their audience - a piece of self-indulgence if ever their was. An insult to the audience. On the very next day I watched The Quiet American - a beautifully crafted film, beautifully acted, superbly directed and stunningly photographed. What a contrast."

It was indeed well-production, and well-acted, but I have to go against the masses for this and prove to its fan base, that it's not as good as they say, it is. Directed by Stephen Frears, written by Peter Morgan, the movie felt very lackluster. First off, this movie wasn't really about the queen, Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren). It was a story about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and how the British Royal family's response to her death. From all the captivating things, that the movie could had gone with, like showcasing Queen Elizabeth II's life, from her time serving in World War 2, to her rise as queen in the 1950s, the end of the British Empire, the Falklands conflict, and others. They choose the more popular Princess Diana over most of her life story. Honestly, you would think a movie, depicting the death of Diana, would be interesting story, but this movie was a huge disappointment. It felt like very British soap opera without much going on, except people talking and talking. It couldn't be a problem, if the movie dialogue wasn't so dull. I know, a lot of people says that the movie has some witty humorous jokes, but I don't see any of it, and if I did, I didn't find myself, laughing at all. The movie only charm, comes from Michael Sheen as British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. It's nice to see him in the role, once again, after playing him in 2003's TV movie, The Deal. He did so well, that once again in 2010, he played Tony Blair in the TV film: The Special Relationship. I think the movie did, kinda focus way too much of him. After all, the movie is supposed to be, about Queen Elizabeth II. Like Michael Sheen, Helen Mirren play Queen Elizabeth II in previous roles as well. She has a long history of playing major royal figures, and with this role, she made it seem majestic and regal. Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II is well-acted. She deserve the Oscar Award for Best Actress. My problem with the film is how unlikeable, they make the Queen, seem. Mirren played the Queen as the same stereotypical, dowdy, dry monarch that many perceive. The Queen might seem stuffy, but so are millions of other people her age, but Queen Elizabeth II is actually very much in touch with her people than what it seem. She does have a sense of humor. Let's remember she was cool about being portray, jumping off an airplane with James Bond in 2012's Olympic Games opening. She's not hiding in some castle, somewhere, most of the time. She was a pretty active leader and more into the times than it seem. She simply made a mistake in 1997 that she didn't understand, what to expect. I think the movie paint Princess Diana, too much as saint-like, making it harder to understand why Queen Elizabeth was so against her. Maybe, if they explore, more of Diana's wild faults and how her actions hurt the Royal family, maybe the audience would feel more about the Queen's tough decision. Since, they don't, it makes it seem like the Queen, was just cold hearted and stubborn to everything about Princess Diana, because she wanted to be, and cowardly hypocrisy caved in, when her power seem like it was going to be taken away. These actions doesn't make a great watch. The movie conflict is very weak. I like how the movie makes it seem, like Queen Elizabeth was going to lose her crown, if she didn't give Diana a public funeral. I really doubt that. It's not like the Royal Family was that arrogant as they were portray in the film! People getting mad, because the royal family chose to grief in private, rather than public seem overdramatic. It was a minor problem that people took too serious. Wasn't there deeper and bigger issues that most Englishmen had to worry about, in 1997, like 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland?! Why couldn't the movie be about that? How the Good Friday Agreement stop the conflict and the killings! Anyways, the movie pacing is really slow for a short movie. It takes forever to get anywhere. It didn't help that the shots of the film were nearly the same. Same locations after another. It felt like nothing is moving. The cinematography was nothing special. I know the movie was trying to go, somewhere with the stag symbolism, but its message seem lost. It could represented how capitalism is shooting down ""monarchy"", but who knows. For a 'monarchy' movie, it needed to be grand, and sadly, it didn't felt that way. It felt very low-budget. As for the movie's content and production value, it felt more like a TV movie. It felt like something that the BBC would aired, one night. After all, the funeral was very theatre like staged, with people showcasing their grief to the public. Maybe, the movie could had told the different between the real life heartache to death behind closed doors, compare to those acted upon of the public eyes. The film could had taken on the issue of media coverage of tragedy, and show how, a real public victims really has no privately, anymore. Sadly, it's not there. The movie really tries hard to connect the real life television news footage, with the actors, but it comes across as messy and not smooth. I hardly remember, the score of the film. Overall: Not a great-watch. The film might have been better if it had dealt with the broader implications of events and been less one-sided and boring. Wish I enjoyed it as much as others, but that didn't happen."

","If there ever was a moment where the authority of Queen Elizabeth II was severely shaken out, where the eventuality of abolishing the monarchy stopped being taboo, it's certainly the week after Lady Di's death. A magnificent rendition of this brief but tumultuous period in British' history, Stephen Frears' ""The Queen"" chronicles the series of events that took place between the car crash and the public funeral in West Minster.<br/><br/>But more than a political film, ""The Queen"" is constructed like an exhilarating psychological arm-wrestling between two antagonistic forces: the freshly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II. Blair had won by a landslide and Elizabeth was incarnating the very establishment the main body of his electors stood against. It's interestingly mentioned that the Queen can't vote because she's above the government, yet the opening meeting with Blair almost belies this fact. As Cherrie Blair tells her husband, people elected him; he's legitimate while the Queen is just a symbol. Peter Morgan's Oscar-nominated screenplay strikes by a very efficient simplicity by clearly setting the two antagonisms right in the beginning.<br/><br/>Being the same age than Prince William, I'm old enough to remember this Sunday morning, Diana was dead¬Ö car accident, paparazzi, well, the causes were as obvious as its aftermath was shocking. I remember I saw women of my family crying and I wondered why? Mother Theresa would die a few days later and I can't remember anyone crying over her loss yet she certainly did more than Lady Di. But Lady Diana was young, beautiful, caring, and in her way, she was embodying a sort of emotional struggle and incarnating an unreachable dream. If she wasn't an innocent victim, her death made her a martyr of her own status. And one thing for sure, she had simply won the people's hearts. <br/><br/>And whether it's the press that guides the feelings or the opposite mattered less than two realities Blair and Elizabeth had to deal with: Britain is a media-centric society and people's emotions never lie. It's indeed impossible to doubt over the sincerity of those who wept, cried or put flowers in Buckingham Palace. Their denial was understandable, but then so was the next stage of grief: anger. Diana's brother accused journalists of having blood on their hands, and people got angry toward the Royal Family's reaction, or lack of reaction as a matter of fact: no half-mast flag, a vacation in Balmoral Palace. The shift between Her Majesty and Britain got wider, crystallizing a popular anger ¬Ö while Tony Blair was the man of the situation.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren's performance is essential as she conveys a subtle nuance of emotionality behind her solid attachment to protocol and of the legendary British sense of composure, this capability to take grief in silence and dignity. At one point, she even confesses her admiration to Muslim rituals where people are buried within the day of the death. The irony is that it's also out of respect for Diana that she wish her funeral would remain private, while the newspapers that criticize the Royal Family are still making money out of her death and maybe use the Royal Family as a convenient scapegoat. If one thing, the script cleverly highlights the complexities of human actions while the noblest actions and not necessarily guided by the noblest motives. <br/><br/>The 'people's princess' that earned a leap in Blair's popularity feels less spontaneous and the character of Alastair, the cynical communication adviser incarnates this defiance toward the Queen just 'for the sake of it'. Even Cherrie Blair seems is more hostile to the Queen than Blair, and it does create an instinctive empathy toward Elizabeth. Meanwhile, the film avoids the opposite Manichaeism by showing a Tony Blair convinced that Britain needs monarchy, while on the Royal Family side, Queen Mum and Prince Edward (a grouchy James Cromwell) don't feel concerned by Diana's death. <br/><br/>""The Queen"" is a battle of opinions, of human relationships and work as a psychological drama. When the Queen accepts to speak, a tabloid titles 'the Queen bends knee to Blair', but it's not Blair's victory that is highlighted here. Blair understands that the Queen must speak for her own interests. And Elizabeth's dilemma leads the story to a more introspective road where she would finally realize that she failed to be on the same wavelength than her people. She didn't bend knee to Tony, but to the people. The film ends two months after the tumultuous weeks when both Tony and the Queen meet again. It's friendlier and warmer, Blair enjoyed the double prestige of having won both the people's heart and preserved the prestige of the Royal Family, but Elizabeth doesn't display much gratitude and warns Blair against the volatility of people' opinions. <br/><br/>Indeed, if a Queen who reigned over 40 years (60 now) failed to understand her people once, it could happen to him as well. The film was released in 2006, before Tony Blair's resignation. And it's interesting to note how times have significantly changed and what turned around came around. Now, Tony Blair is mostly remembered for his disastrous alliance with George W. Bush in the infamous War Iraq -and contrarily to Elizabeth, Blair didn't make a mea culpa, he never regretted his involvement- while the Queen is more respected than ever, the marriage between Charles and Camilla is accepted, William and Kate are under the spots. <br/><br/>Maybe it's true that in a media-centric society, emotions can be guided, and what remain strong enough to last are the institutions. And Helen Mirren perfectly captured the unflappability of a sacred institution with still a faithful respect toward people, and for that, she truly deserved her Oscar."

","Helen Miren portrays Queen Elizabeth II with such grace it was astonishing. The other actors and actresses were good and their parts interesting but ""The Queen"" is the story of the challenges to not only Elizabeth's monarchy but to her person. When I was in 4th or 5th grade I read a book about Elizabeth and Margaret as children by Marion Crawford titled ""The Little Princesses"". Since I am what is known as a baby-boomer I grew up in a time that went from respect, manners and tradition to familiarity, bluntness and spontaneity. There is strength and fault in both worlds and typical misunderstandings of generations follow these shifts. I am fortunate to have known from that book how the royal family presented itself to the public in the 40's and 50's so when Princess Diana died my heart went out to the Royal family, Diana's family and the people of Britain. As an American growing up in a family that honored Britain and the British it was sad to see the pain and disillusionment Diana's death caused and or revealed. Not only did two young boys loose their mother but the country who loved her became estranged into pro monarchy and anti monarchy factions. This film has moments that made me very uncomfortable, probably because I found it embarrassing to see private family talk turned into what a film writer thought it was. I was most disappointed in the portrayal of the Queen Mother. But death does force us to examine our feelings and deal with them if we expect to move on and that is what this film shows in the end. It honors all those millions of people who wept for Diana, her sons and family and it shows that the Royal Family capitulated to public demands when it became obvious to do otherwise would cause more internal strife and pain. The Queen above all else loves, respects and cherishes her country and it's people. She grew up in another era and it is difficult to become open, emotional and give up tradition when you have learned from the cradle that tradition is what keeps things going smoothly. Be sure you read something about the time when Queen Elizabeth II was a child before you judge her to harshly. I think she is truly a blessing for her people."

","During the week following the death of the Princess of Wales, Queen Elizabeth II and her family struggle to come to terms with their own reaction, that of the new Government and that of the British public.<br/><br/>Frears and Morgan offer up a speculative view of the private dynamics between Royal Family members and between Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Queen. Mixing documentary footage and fictionalised dialogues, director and writer build a fascinating portrayal of a monarch faced with a set of circumstances her whole life and reign has never prepared her for, and the clash between age-old establishment and newly minted modern populist government. However she may have felt about previous Prime Ministers (here we only get a sense of her feelings towards her first, Winston Churchill), we are left without any doubt of her disdain towards Blair, and the ensuing events resulting from her former daughter-in-law's death only serve to heighten this apparent contempt. However, regardless of her innate sense of tradition and duty, she is slowly forced to question and reconsider what at first seems the Monarchy's obvious and natural response to Diana's death. Despite the opinions of both the Queen Mother and Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth begrudgingly takes her Prime Minister's advice and thus seemingly avoids a constitutional crisis.<br/><br/>Much praise has been heaped upon The Queen and especially Mirren's portrayal of the British monarch, and for the most part, this is well deserved. Mirren is indeed superb as the embattled Queen, creating an at once believable depiction of someone whose life and purpose have been moulded and crafted as something fixed, unwavering and unquestioning. The economy with which she allows us to witness Elizabeth's distress over her own unprecedented situation is quite wonderful ¬ñ her face behind the wheel of the Land Rover prior to arrival at the river crossing is sublime. Further economies of play show us the nature of her relationship with her son (witness their scene at the young Princes' bedroom door). Indeed, Jennings is equally superb as Charles, creating a quiet portrait of dignity and desire for distance despite the apparent grief and bewilderment. Further kudos to Sheen as Blair, although he only just manages to avoid caricature, and Sims' delightful depiction of The Queen Mother, a lovely mix of rigid institutionalism and wry humour.<br/><br/>Good bits? Mirren, Jennings, Sims, Sheen, large tracts of clever, sparkling and witty script, some wonderful set pieces (the river crossing, the telephone exchanges between Queen and PM, the concluding meeting between Mr. Blair and Elizabeth), and the nod to Blair's journey as somehow being the equal and opposite to the Queen's (just as she accepts the need for change, so he respectfully realises the enormity of what this represents to her).<br/><br/>Bad bits? Horrible 'two dimensional' portrayals of Cherie Blair, Prince Philip and Alistair Campbell (not the fault of the actors, rather the clumsy shortcomings of an at times very clunky script), an occasional tendency for the script to adopt a mocking tone (the cheap Gordon Brown joke, pretty much every sentence uttered by Campbell and Cherie) and a general sneering quality towards the British Government generally.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a wickedly funny and terribly sad exploration of what could have been happening within the House of Windsor during the first week of September 1997, and certainly Mirren and Frears deserve every trophy they have garnered. Not quite so sure about the same praise showered on Morgan's script however."

Here's another, from a far inferior writer (he started with some TV farrago called ""Shalom Joan Collins""), and another director who should have known better, Stephen Frears. Writer and director pretend they knew exactly what was happening in Number 10 and in Balmoral Castle, without a scrap of evidence to show for it. For all we know, the Queen was being held captive in Balmoral, and Blair was obeying his CIA masters who saw him into office. There's no mention of the security services of any of the countries involved: the USA, France or the UK. The portrait of Tony Blair is fawning: family man, working stiff, decent to the core. The portrait of HM Queen is even more reverent: reserved to a fault, massively dignified, a true monarch. Her inward humanity is demonstrated by the idea that she felt sorry for a stag shot by an investment banker: pure fantasy, of course. However, the spectacle of Reggie Dwight/Elton John entering Westminster Abbey to sing his Marilyn Monroe song adapted for Diana (she didn't even merit a new song) reminded one of the hideous reality of TV Britain, and I must admit that for one moment I actually sympathised with my sovereign (as presented in effigy by the film-makers)."

","I had high expectations of The Queen. The reviews are sparkling - on here like everywhere else. A brilliant and representative character drama, we are told. I have to say I didn't spot it.<br/><br/>I did laugh. In the right places too - the jokes are good. And Mirren performs excellently, of course. But this script...!?! What is this supposed to be? It's a silly story, literally reminiscent of The Royle Family. Neither Queen, nor Blair, nor Royal family are at all plausible. It's like a cheap, made-for-TV ITV drama, with very expensive sets.<br/><br/>Where it fails most utterly is in capturing the mood of the nation at that memorable time. Like most of the reviewers I remember this time well and this reflects my recollection of events not at all. The emphasis seems to be way off. There is great attention lavished upon odd, relatively obscure events. I am prepared to believe that maybe life was truly like this for a small minority of aristocracy-obsessed Sun readers, but for the rest of us it really wasn't. It comes across as if contrived to make a point - I'm not sure exactly what - but fails to do so because of the implausible script.<br/><br/>I think my disappointment may be down to off-the-mark expectations. I expected a) an intelligent treatment of the Queen as a subject and b) quality film-making (which can typically shine through regardless of subject matter). I found neither - it's about Diana, not Elizabeth, and the film-making is naff.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed by the treatment of Blair - I felt like I was watching Rik Mayal as Alan B'stard. Mrs Blair is particularly one-dimensional as the unhelpful, anti-monarchy first lady (has she been cast like this purely for being Catholic?).<br/><br/>I can only assume that the delighted reviews are from Diana's many fans, or at least individuals deeply interested in her and her legacy - I suspect this group will enjoy the film. Enthusiastic royalists who just want to see their heroes portrayed on screen may also like it. However if you're looking for a historical treatment, an intelligent review of whether monarchy can remain relevant, or a period study of Britain in 1997 you'll have to look elsewhere."

Who the hell invited Richard Branson, Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg and Elton John, I wondered?

To bad the script gave her nothing meaningful to say or do.<br/><br/>In fact, what was the film actually about? What a great person Diana was? What an evil thing the Paparazzi are? How much the world loved Diana? How much the Queen hated Diana? How out of touch the Monarchy is with it's people? Or, based on the apparent emphasis of the film, was it saying that Tony Blair is the only clear-thinking reasonable person in all of England and how on earth did they ever muddle through without him? They took awkward, disjointed stabs at each of those things, then like kid with ADD and a double espresso, lurched jerkily to the next thing without looking back.<br/><br/>It was choppily edited; scenes didn't flow one into another, nor was the sense of passing time well-communicated.

It should be evident to everybody that during World War II it was Churchill who was the leader of his country, and that currently it has been Tony Blair. If the queen had made any important decision, about England's public policies, the English people would have requested her resignation long ago, just like it is happening to Mr. Blair.

","A screenplay obviously written by Tony Blair's henchman, the film shows how in seven days in September, Downing Street saved the Monarchy from itself. It is true that he read the mood of the country well and, in his early days of premiership, counselled Her Majesty responsibly. But the supposition that he alone was responsible (along with a well-crafted speech from his slimy PR man)for saving the Family from its demise is a little too far-fetched, even if it shows typically how Blair's Government machine works. What he did do, however, is translate the people's considerations into action and that is admirable. The ghastliness of his wife, Cherie Blair, who would like to see the destruction of everything British, is admirably shown and Alastair is excellently portrayed. The Queen Mum comes across as a bit of a drunk, Prince Phillip as a selfish nincompoop (well, that is true to form) but it is the towering performance of Helen Mirren as the Queen herself that gives the viewer the impression that we are indeed seeing the Queen. I remember at the time feeling angry at the Monarchy and thinking that the Royal Household was indeed an anachronism for the 21st Century. I wanted Diana as my Queen and felt that she had breathed a breath of fresh air into the Establishment. But the more Tony Blair's Government has tried insidiously to destroy the wonderfully-performing Institutions of the Country in the guise of modernising them (through his party's resentment of them) the more I feel sorry for the Queen and wish she still had the power to tell him where to go. Helen Mirren performed her job so well I felt that she had embraced all those feelings I felt, and indeed the Queen herself must have felt, at a time when it was seen the Windsors could get nothing right. Let us remember it was public anger at Prince Charles' adultery and the family's treatment of Diana that caused the resentful public feelings and not just the Queen per se. Nobody really came out of the film unscathed (except for the irritating Blair - beautifully played by Mr.Sheen) and indeed it was an expose of what happens when immovable tradition meets current day mores."

This represented the royal family in a way only English (and Scottish) actors could do.

Sadly, her blonde and elegant looks are carefully hidden behind the mask she wears to portray The Queen, but her acting is clearly visible. She is now Elizabeth II, but she does however slide very carefully and modestly in the role, and portrays her brilliantly throughout. Michael Sheen (an enigma ¬ñ to me) is also excellent at portraying the Prime Minister, and he also should deserve an award for his fine performance. James Cromwell ¬ñ originally I thought it was a bit risky, getting an American to play the husband of the British Queen, but he also slides into the role of Prince Philip, with an excellent British accent. Helen McCrory also does a well-analyzed performance as Cherrie Blair. Finally, Sylvia Syms makes an interesting but well-acted performance as The Queen Mother, providing us with one or two, undisruptive, comical one-liners.<br/><br/>I just got back from seeing The Queen, with my mother, and I was not at the least disappointed. The entire cast was well chosen and all perform modestly and admirably. The directing is also rather exceptional: Stephen Frears was an excellent choice, but sadly underrated. I had never hard of him prior to watching this film, and would like to congratulate him on making such a superb film.<br/><br/>I was also impressed with the use of the genuine archive footage from when Diana died, used at certain parts of the film. As well as the speech taken from her Majesty The Queen that Helen Mirren delivers in her own, non-plagiarized way. My only criticism would be that because the majority of the film is reliant on dialogue, it is unsure how much of it is true and how much is made up. None the less it was a riveting film that gave me goose bumps several times! An excellent way to spend a Saturday morning."

","This is a very disappointing movie. It plays like a TV movie of the week. Admittedly Helen Mirren is made to look and sound a lot like the Queen, but that's about it. The rest is fluff, eye candy, and instantly forgettable.<br/><br/>I never understood this fascination with Diana, without which this film would never have been made. And because the facts and personae are all so known, there is not much leeway for the script or the characters. Charlie, Philip, Blair, they all are cheap caricatures of the original, despite their protestations to the contrary.<br/><br/>My only consolation is that I did not pay full fare at the theatre."

","There is a moment late in the film where Queen Elizabeth seems almost human when she meets P.M. Tony Blair three months after the death of Princess Diana. It is at that moment that she seems grateful for what Mr. Blair was able to convey to the grieving nation, and for coming to her defense when everyone was down on the institution she represents.<br/><br/>""The Queen"" is a recap of the tragic week England, and the rest of the world lived in 1997 when Diana Spencer, the beautiful Princess of Wales, and the mother of the future king of England died tragically in Paris. Tony Blair, who had been elected Prime Minister shortly before the tragedy, was the one who sensed what the public wanted from their Queen and he goes against his Queen's wishes to stay behind the scenes and go on with a private funeral. That tactical error on the Queen's part catapulted Tony Blair to be seen by the English in a different light.<br/><br/>We are given glimpses of a Queen Elizabeth that wants to stick to the traditions that had been observed in a rigid England. She had no intention of changing for anything in the world, and neither does the Queen Mother. Prince Philip's way to dealing with what his grandsons are going through is taking them hunting to keep them occupied. There is no feeling of tenderness, or even one of love between the Queen and her grandchildren, or for Charles, her oldest son.<br/><br/>Queen Elizabeth II has reigned for more than fifty three years. Monarchy fell on her when her father died. Duty weighs heavily on everything she does. Elizabeth, a no nonsense woman, lives in the tradition that doesn't deviate for nothing or anyone. The death of Diana put an end to a life the Queen must have despised for being a young woman with a popularity of her own. Diana represented everything the Queen abhorred so her ultimate demise is a relief for Elizabeth. That is why she doesn't want to do anything for the Princess of Wales because she considers her not a member of the royal family.<br/><br/>What Elizabeth didn't take into consideration was the reaction of the English people when they learned about the beautiful Diana. The grief they felt was alien to Elizabeth who had been taught to hide her feelings and carry on, the way it was expected of her. Her mistake for not reading the public's sentiment was something she never expected and it backfired on her.<br/><br/>Stephen Frears, the talented director of ""The Queen"", is a man who clearly was a natural for the material. Peter Morgan's screen play tries to give us a portrait of a woman in turmoil at a point of her life when the Queen and the royal family were at the center of tabloid scandals caused by a sensational press that saw any opportunity to ridicule the monarchy.<br/><br/>It's difficult to imagine any other actress but Helen Mirren to play the Queen of England. Ms. Mirren's mannerisms, the royal way in which she moves to give the viewer an idea of what the real Queen Elizabeth is in real life, is what makes the film to be the tremendous crowd pleaser it is. Helen Mirren clearly understands this woman and brings her to life so naturally.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen, who plays Tony Blair, equally matches Ms. Mirren. This is perhaps Mr. Sheen's best role in quite a while. James Cromwell's Prince Philip shows a callous man who seems out of touch with reality. Sylvia Syms is seen as the Queen Mother. Roger Allan appears as the Queen's secretary, Robbin Janvrin. Alex Jennings plays Prince Charles.<br/><br/>The film is made even better by Affonso Beato's cinematography and the music score by Alexandre Desplat plays well in the background. Ultimately, this is the triumph for Stephen Frears and Helen Mirren."
"carlos.virgile-3","9","5","9","25 September 2006"," Royal voyeurism
","What I found interesting of The Queen is how it manages to exploit the voyeuristic tendencies of a cinema audience without ever transgressing the limits of acceptability, transforming the plot into caricature or a vulgar British farce. It reminded me of the work of photographer artist Alison Jackson who uses celebrities' lookalikes to create images that encourage the viewer to believe they are true, although they constantly play with the idea of collective fantasy. This border between true and untrue is the principle of the attraction of the movie, and the through the keyhole vision of the Royals and Downing Street comes at a time where obsession with fame and celebrity does not in any way escape them. This is a game that Diana knew well to play for her own advantage and won hands down, even after her untimely or, perhaps for some, God sent death. <br/><br/>Stephen Frears clever device of mixing newsreel footage showing real images give credibility to the artificiality of those based in what we assume it might have happened or are just product of his and the scriptwriter Peter Morgan's imagination. Undoubtedly is Helen Mirren the only one that not only carries the weight of the film on her shoulders but blurs, purely through the use of her amazing talent as an actress, all boundaries between what is believable and what is not.<br/><br/>The other aspect of the film that I found interesting and exciting was the suggestion of a dramatic shift of certain British values, a change of character present already since the earlier Thatcher's years and then completed by Blair after wards, that has transformed British society drastically in the last two decades. Although the subject is at the core of the film this could have been dealt with in more depth - what is it that has affected this change and made the British tribe so different to what they once were? <br/><br/>The film seems to present the opposite poles of stiff upper lip unemotional and repressed attitude of the monarch and her entourage to those of the public showing off their emotions and unable to contain them as well as those in government searching for modernization and progress. The corrosive influence that the period of the last two decades or more have had in the fundamental transformation of those presumably permanent cultural and character forming values perhaps is something the film misses by only showing the queen as attached to old traditions and made the way she is as a consequence of her duty and upbringing. At the risk of sounding like defending the monarchy perhaps someone will one day take the challenge of making a film about this loss of values and put a mirror in front of the British population instead of doing so, gently and with a light tone, only to their Gracious Queen."
"johnmcc150","8","5","9","22 September 2006"," A compelling film
","The opening scene of most films has to establish some facts, but the Queen bemoaning her lack of a vote to a portrait painter seemed contrived. After this shaky start, Helen Mirren's performance as the Queen is convincing, but Prunella Scales got closer to her detached competence in 'A Question of Attribution'. All the other performances were also excellent.<br/><br/>There have been only a few times since the War that the whole of the UK had the same mood. (News of the invasion of the Falklands and 11 September 2001 were similar times.) I had almost forgotten the strange atmosphere in that week. Even though the public did not really know Diana, they thought they did and so the feeling of loss was universal. This film brought this back and gave a plausible account of what happened, though the truth may have been different.<br/><br/>A few people come out of it badly: the Queen's private secretary who appeared so deferential that he dared not give the Queen vital advice while she was isolated at Balmoral; Cherie Blair whose seemed to be a frustrated tricoteuse; Alistair Campbell whose only principles seemed to be based on getting favourable headlines; and Charles who just appeared wet. Again reality may have been different, though I suspect not very different.<br/><br/>At least one good joke went unnoticed by many. Blair says ""Tell Gordon (Brown) to hang on"". Something that Brown is still doing over nine years later.<br/><br/>Incidentally, fourteen-point stags are old animals that have to be culled or they may starve in the coming winter. (I nevertheless dislike people doing it for fun.) If the stag was supposed to be a metaphor for Diana, I struggled to work out what it was trying to say.<br/><br/>All in all well worth seeing."
"postmanwhoalwaysringstwice","9","4","7","13 December 2007"," Affecting, entertaining, dignified film-making
","It seems conceivable that without Helen Mirren, Stephen Frears would have been completely unable to make ""The Queen"". However with her in the title role, the story of the days following Princess Diana's untimely passing in 1997 is able to be told with heart, honor, and dignity. Mirren's real-life character of Queen Elizabeth II represents the old guard of British royalty, unwillingly brought into high status as a teenager, but left to represent and respect the protocol of her standing which is exactly as she saw it after Diana's accident. The British public called for some presence and acknowledgement of their mourning from the royals, but the Queen stood by her resolve and faced the negative press for it. Mirren brings a great pulse to a person who would have been merely the conflicted antagonist in a different sort of film. This is not to state that Mirren pulls this film all by herself. A strong supporting cast and archival footage that encompasses a surprising amount of the plot add additional dimensions to this fine slice of real-life drama."

","HELEN MIRREN is, of course, the focal point in THE QUEEN, but MICHAEL SHEEN as Tony Blair certainly more than matches her in the role of Britain's youngest prime minister. The two of them give towering performances that will remain indelibly impressed on your mind after viewing the film. Mirren is all crisp elegance and Sheen is a charmer who knows how to use his powers of persuasion. Both of them are ideally cast in roles they seem to inhabit with consummate ease.<br/><br/>The screenplay deals with the unpleasant private events unfolding at the palace while the public mourning was obviously so great that it had to be acknowledged. The Queen preferred keeping tight-lipped and dignified, obviously not a woman who was pleased with Diana's conduct. Nor was her husband Prince Philip (JAMES CROMWELL) or Prince Charles (ALEX JENNINGS) who at least reminded his mother that Diana loved her children dearly.<br/><br/>Handsomely photographed with newsreel footage of the crowds that began swelling shortly after Diana's demise in that tragic accident, its dialog is convincing throughout, concise and to the point without any frills whatsoever. The only weakness in the casting would seem to be SYLVIA SYMS as the Queen Mother who somehow doesn't look the role.<br/><br/>The original background score by Alexandre Desplat is worthy of note, always appropriate and sometimes majestic. The scene with The Queen seeing the stag on the hillside while waiting for her car to be repaired is a standout, beautifully played.<br/><br/>Summing up: A rare treat, and a slice of history well worth remembering with the shift from the old monarchy to the modernized ideas of a young Prime Minister emphasized in the script."
"sweetchef50","5","7","15","1 November 2006"," Defending the Queen
","To understand the very notion of monarchy and duty in an episodic script is highly ambitious and ultimately, tragically manipulative and boring. And the Stag scene of the Queen in isolation (are we kidding here?)is absurd. Why was this film made? To rectify the throne of the British empire through the remarkable Diana story is short sighted and boorish. I do believe, however, that a story about the live, historical, relationship of the Queen and Diana through Diana's death would offer more material which would lead to a greater historical understanding, ie, truth, than a premise of Hey Guys, the Queen is really just doing her job after all, and is really a very nice person despite her upbringing.(a message that is repeated and repeated and repeated in various forms....) Helen Mirren does..a ..good.. job... with the script she is given - but as a viewer I wanted more truth - more meat - more humanity - than the script gave. The Queen is still living - so this is a very tidy piece of propaganda that is easy to defend - but I am not buying it. The filmmakers made a film that I suspect they know is not whole - with a script that is easy to excuse because they were so intent on doing the right thing. Is this dramatically correct?"

","Was this movie written on a 5th grade level? I gave it about 20 minutes and just had to turn it off. The characters are one-dimensional and speak like fumbling adolescents. The script reads like a freshman's really bad film school project. I was not quite convinced that Tony Blair would not know how to behave when presenting himself to the Queen, or that the Queen would be so flat in dealing with Diana's death. It's like a bad British attempt at a fluffy American movie. One redeeming attribute is actual footage that's interwoven into the film, that was taken as the public's reaction to Diana's death -- but, ironically, that attribute just makes the scripted scenes seem all the more flat and contrived. Well, at least they still say ma'am over there."
"gws-2","10","5","10","11 November 2006"," The Stag at Eve
","In this wonderful film, director Stephen Frears uses a beautiful 14 point buck roaming the Scottish highlands as a metaphor for Queen Elizabeth II's troubles caused by her cold reaction to the death of her former daughter in law, Diana. The buck in ""The Queen"" died but Elizabeth, like Sir Walter Scott's famous ""Stag at eve,"" certainly did not.<br/><br/>The film examines how the new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and the queen work out the queen's initial refusal to publicly acknowledge Diana's death in any way. It's a great story well told by Frears' (""High Fidelity."" ""The Grifters""). The screenplay, by Peter Morgan, and the acting by an ensemble case of mostly British actors were laudable. The brilliant Helen Mirren was at the top of her game here, producing a picture of a woman who was both cold and imperious, out of her depth and deeply afraid, and most important of all, sympathetic. <br/><br/>Following her divorce from Prince Charles, Diana, the former Princess of Wales, went public with many embarrassing tales out of school about her marriage to Charles. Her conduct permanently alienated her from the royal family. But because of her beauty charisma, and media savvy Diana succeeded in portraying herself as an innocent victim, not a manipulative malcontent. <br/><br/>When Diana tragically died in a Paris automobile accident at the age of 37, the outpouring of grief was remarkable, although it should not have been. All one had to do was look at the identical reaction to the death of former Beatle John Lennon in 1980. Although such outpourings of grief are a mile wide and an inch deep, the Queen should have known better that to ignore her people's remorse at Princess Di's untimely end. The Queen, like so many other public figures since learned the perils of the 24 hour news cycle.<br/><br/>""The Queen"" is a brilliant character study played by an equally brilliant character actress. From her tightly permed head to her slightly thickening ankles and sensible shoes, Mirren was Elizabeth II. Although she should have known better than to try to avoid addressing Diana's death, in her defense she was getting a lot of bad advice from within her palace, notably by a boneheaded, priggish Prince Phillip, played by the always wonderful James Cromwell. But Elizabeth had the wit to listen to her Prime Minister, a political genius if ever there was one, and take the right actions and say the right things to rehabilitate her reputation. <br/><br/>Highly recommended and not to be missed. 9 out of 10."

This one's set in Jolly Old England- but, unlike the hilarious SHAUN OF THE DEAD, THE QUEEN lacks the humor that made the former tolerable. The result of this lack of humor is a staid, motionless picture that fails to entertain on any level. The makeups sported by the principals are very lifelike, but, given the fact that these zombies do little more than walk and talk, that isn't saying much; most remain totally expressionless throughout the proceedings.

"MBunge","8","3","5","13 June 2011"," As spectacular a docu-drama as the genre ever gets
","A scrupulous docu-drama about how the death of Princess Diana elevated a newly elected prime minister and nearly devastated the British monarchy, The Queen does a wonderful job at fairly depicting the strengths and weaknesses of aristocratic privilege and democratic modernity. With a script that avoids all excess and sparkling performances by Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen, it's that rarest of all works of fiction - one that enlightens and well as entertains.<br/><br/>Anyone old enough to remember the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Di also remembers the way her life ended in Paris, practically chased to death by the paparazzi. In the week after that tragedy, Great Britain was consumed in an orgy of public grief and a growing anger at a royal family that pointedly refused to join in the ostentatious mourning. This movie seeks to give a fair hearing to the much maligned royals, acknowledging the basic ridiculousness of a 20th century society willfully engaging in the mass delusion of treating an unelected, unappointed and factually powerless figurehead as if she were still important, while being fair to that figurehead and her family for the odd behavior their odder situation has cultivated in them.<br/><br/>Deftly fusing together real news footage with re-enactments and dramatic inventions, The Queen is a brilliant blend of family turmoil, political maneuvering and social observation. It takes us inside the royal family and tries to demonstrate the peril and the promise of hereditary power. The Queen (Helen Mirren) is a shining example that when privilege is married to at least a sense of responsibility, it can produce someone quite impressive and worthy. When privilege is divorced from responsibility, we see the results in the seething arrogance of the Queen's husband, Philip (James Cromwell), and the sniveling weakness of her son, Prince Charles (Alex Jennings). Charles is actually the most fascinating character in the story, as it's subtly suggested that keeping him in subservient irrelevance for his entire adult life trapped him in a state of emotional adolescence.<br/><br/>Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) is a man given power to reform British life and finds his first challenge is the daunting task of preserving the very heart of British tradition. In life, Princess Diana became a complicated woman with virtues and vices. In death, she became a secular saint which the public demanded the royal family bow down before. The fact that Diana had been a pain in the royal neck for many years didn't matter. The fact that such insistent wallowing in grief was overwrought and unseemly didn't matter. The people demanded and their supposed sovereign had to obey, something the movie makes clear the Queen should have understood herself.<br/><br/>This is just a tremendous film with crackerjack writing and masterful direction that crystallizes a moment of history about as well as anything else in cinema. You should definitely watch this."

","Helen Mirren is ""The Queen,"" a 2006 film that dramatizes what went on in the Royal House of Windsor after the death of Princess Diana, when Queen Elizabeth is deeply criticized for refusing to speak publicly about the event. Prime Minister Tony Blair urges her to change her mind. Elizabeth must grapple with her own views in a changing world that has somehow left her behind.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is so excellent that I forgot I was watching actors and actually believed I was watching the real situation. This left me wondering how close to the truth it was. The emotions conveyed were probably correct even if actual incidents were not. ""The Queen"" is a brilliant psychological study of a woman who, when she was young, had fame thrust upon her, as she deals with the death of her ex-daughter-in-law, who achieved greatness. Michael Sheen was absolutely uncanny as Tony Blair, who walks a fine line dealing with Buckingham Palace and political forces; and James Cromwell as Phillip comes off as a bitter, angry Diana hater...probably not far from the truth.<br/><br/>To understand Queen Elizabeth and her actions, the family's history is important. Her branch of the family was not intended for the throne; it was the unusual circumstance of Edward, Duke of Windsor, abdicating that made the Elizabeth's father, the shy George, King of England. In a world where responsibility came first and personal feelings second, it was a shocking situation. Some years later, Elizabeth, who worshipped her father, was seen off on a trip to Africa by King George. White-faced and ill, he watched her plane until it disappeared in the sky. Prince Philip was taken aside during the African trip and told that the King was dead; long live the Queen. A shattered Elizabeth had to emerge from the plane on her return to England as a young woman in complete control of her emotions - a young woman who should have been King Edward's niece, a royal personage who occasionally cut a ribbon - was herself the Queen.<br/><br/>Her life became one of formality, respectability and responsibility while her sister Margaret dated divorced men, drank, and took trips to islands with male companions. It isn't any wonder that Diana was someone she could never understand - or understood better than she wanted. The most poignant scene in the film occurs when Elizabeth sees a noble stag that all the hunters are after and shoos it away. A metaphor certainly for Diana, a beautiful creature who had wandered into a world she could never comfortably live in nor understand.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren has long been one of my favorite actresses; her performance is perfection. She portrays Elizabeth as strong, intelligent and reserved, but with a kind heart and sensitivity. It's one of those rare times when the actress becomes the role rather than plays it.<br/><br/>The script is superb, and the use of news footage of Princess Diana is edited into the film beautifully. Although all of the acting is wonderful, Helen Mirren towers over this movie, giving a powerful, unforgettable performance of a remarkable woman."

","Great Britain's Queen Elizabeth II comes under fire from her people after her stoic dignity prevents her or any of the Royals from showing public grief after the passing of Princess Diana of Wales. Newly-appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair takes it upon himself to try to rally the British Monarch, yet one can sense that Her Majesty's personal ill-will towards Diana (plus a complete ignorance on the Queen's part over how much Diana was truly loved by the nation) is keeping her from connecting to the public--and perhaps to the vulnerable woman hidden deep within herself. Despite the interpolated news-footage and interviews with the real Lady Diana (which are distinctly jarring in this dramatization), ""The Queen"" is a careful, often amazing and emotional re-staging of recent history. There is hardly a feeling of suspicion in lieu of its facts--we in the audience believe just about every word of it--and this is due to both the superb screenplay by Oscar-nominated Peter Morgan and the leading performance by Oscar winner Helen Mirren, who captures the sometimes-imposing/sometimes-not Queen of England with grace and bemusement. *** from ****"

","Insightful story where the audience gets a ""fly-on-the-wall"" view of what might have gone on behind closed doors in the aftermath of Lady Diana Spencer's death.<br/><br/>Certainly there was, at the time these events unfolded, plenty of speculation by the gossip tabloids, as well as the public, and this story molds all of it into a balanced study. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II, and Michael Sheen as the young Prime Minister Tony Blair are impressive in their respective roles. The newly installed PM Blair exhibits a wisdom and charisma essential for a leader in these unexpected circumstances. The Queen herself is, by her own admission, a product of another era, educated during World War II. The views and opinions of the masses have turned a paradigm shift over the years, and she struggles to understand this (with the counsel of Blair).<br/><br/>Therein lies what appears to be the larger question for thought posed by the movie. What exactly is the function of the Monarchy in modern Britain? Is this ceremonial ""institution"" necessary, or is it an archaic figure head that no longer serves any useful purpose? Everyone of course will have different attitudes about this, and the movie is fair in its portrayal of both the Queen as well as her detractors.<br/><br/>The movie is well edited with a fair measure of actual footage from newscasts from the 1997 events, and manages to use these without allowing them to become intrusive. It's well edited, and the media's impact on what occurs is well documented. The character driven approach is managed well by clear direction, and the acting by the entire cast is human and real. The movie resists the temptation to take cheap shots of target practice at any one person; instead, it gives a measured view, and provides insights for consideration."
"bob the moo","Null","3","5","12 July 2007"," Feels like a television drama perhaps, but if it is, then it is a superior one
","1997. Princess Diana is in a car crash in a tunnel in Paris. Hours later she is dead. Back in England, the new Labour Prime Minster Tony Blair senses how the country will react to the news and addresses the nation with a poignant and perfectly-scripted statement outside of a church. Meanwhile, the Royal family stay remote, trying to handle the grief, with the Queen refusing to lose her dignity by engaging in this very public mourning. However with the tabloids (who else) leading the charge, soon her restraint is being seen as callousness.<br/><br/>I had fallen asleep watching a movie after a Saturday night at work and was woken by television in the middle of the morning to hear of the car crash. I went back to sleep and woke in the morning to find that Diana had died as a result of her injuries. I think many people were surprised by the public outpouring of emotion that followed ¬ñ not just because it was Diana but more because we hadn't really seen this type of thing before. I'm still quite young but I still think of the British stiff upper-lip and dignity and this very public mourning just seems to contrast with that idea. Many people think this way looking back so imagine then the conflict in the minds of the Royal family ¬ñ mostly an older generation raised to be dignified, restrained and respectful, with public emotion perhaps seen as distasteful.<br/><br/>At the time this contrast was even more obvious as the UK had just had the young, modernising Blair sweeping into the office of the Prime Minister. It is simple to view (as some tabloids did) the Royal response as being heartless and cold but this is more the failure to understand what the differences are between the previous generation (who were told restraint) and the generations of the late 1990's (where television talk shows had encouraged outward emotion while tabloids erode the idea of privacy and restraint). I'm not sure when it actually happened but Diana's death was the biggest, sudden demonstration of it and I agreed with the line ""something's happened ¬ñ some shift in values"" because even to me as a ""normal"" person it was somewhat of a surprise, like it had come from nowhere.<br/><br/>The title of the film suggests it will be about the Queen herself and, while it is true that her character is the main one, the film itself is more about this cultural divide between what England used to be and what it is now and how that is manifested in the attitude of the Royals versus that of the ""public"" (or at least a million or so of them and countless newspaper editors). As a total production it feels a little bit like it has been made as a high-budget television drama but this doesn't really matter because the film is very strong in how it depicts this generational clash. The narrative stays closely to what we know as facts and, around that, builds private conversations and interactions in a way that is convincing within the context of both the people but also the theme.<br/><br/>In doing this well the film surprised me by being stronger than I had expected. I had feared that it would be a soapy replay of the period of time, with fictional conversations filling it out but by being close to reality and understanding what was actually happening that week (which the media mostly failed to appreciate or chose to ignore or simplify). A great deal of credit for this belongs to Peter Morgan as writer as his script allows for the dual approach to be equally strong. Frears' direction is perhaps a bit ""television"" but mostly he is good ¬ñ I liked the way that peace and remoteness of Balmoral was contrasted with the busyness of New Labour's government in London.<br/><br/>In regards the cast of course it is Mirren that takes the headlines as she presents her character in a way that shows she does understand the cultural conflict within the narrative really well. Sheen's Blair is good as it has been a few other places. He looks and acts like the man but never to the point where it becomes an impersonation. Cromwell does well to avoid the ""clown"" caricature that we all think of when thinking of Prince Phillip, while Jennings, Syms and others make up the family well. Bazeley's Campbell is an enjoyably harsh and cynical creation and he does it pretty well.<br/><br/>Overall then, it may have a feel of a television drama at times but the strong performances and script mean it runs stronger than I expected. Kudos to Morgan in particular for writing a script that balances the ""drama"" side of the story with the wider context of generational and cultural misunderstandings."

","Its not easy to make this kind of movie. The plot was followed by most of the audience as it occurred in reality, and has been analyzed and re-analyzed in the years since. For the most part the principal characters are all still alive, and active in the public eye. Our familiarity with them makes the actors jobs much more difficult as every viewer has the ability to critique the performance in terms of accuracy.<br/><br/>The makers of the film overcame these obstacles. The acting is wonderful, and the film progresses at a good pace. The use of archive footage, and how it is edited into the film provides an interesting counterpoint to an otherwise conservatively filmed movie. This technique gives the audience some insight into how the royals must feel, a formal audience one second, and blur of flashes and images assaulting you the next.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren is excellent. Her queen is an heir to a thousand year old tradition that is being slowly backed into a corner by the people. She wants to hold on to the very few things left to her, tradition and proper decorum, and even those are stripped away from her one by one. At the end we see her transformation, her realization that the institution of the monarchy is more important than its details. And perhaps even though she symbolizes a by gone era, she chose to tread in new territory in how the royal family would act in its role of the symbolic head of the family of Britain.<br/><br/>The DVD adds two excellent commentaries which greatly enhance the film. First is the director and writer, giving their perspective on the making of the film, while the second is by a royal expert, who points out departures from reality that the creative process took, as well as putting events and actions into context and explaining their importance or relevance."

","""You met me at a very strange time in my life"", The Narrator, from Fight Club (1999).<br/><br/>Just like The Narrator, we meet Elizabeth II, Queen of England, at a very strange time in her life. The film starts in May of 1997. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), leader of the Labour Party, had just won the general election, ending 18 years of government by the Conservative Party. 3 months later, Diana, Princess of Wales, died after a car crash in Paris. Initially, The Queen (Oscar winner Helen Mirren) wanted the funeral to be a private one, since Diana was no longer part of the royal family. She also thought there was no need to address the nation regarding this event. But slowly, The Queen starts to realize people from all over the world are accusing her of not showing enough grief over Diana's death. If that wasn't enough, she later finds out 25% of the British people want to get rid of the monarchy altogether. For the first time in her life, The Queen, who had always thought nobody knows the British citizens more than she does, feels she has completely lost touch with her people. Some radical changes had to be made.<br/><br/>Unlike what you might expect, The Queen is not a boring history lesson. In fact, I thought it was very entertaining. That was mainly due to Peter Morgan's (Last King of Scotland) great script, and the amazing directing done by Stephen Frears (High Fidelity).<br/><br/>The script is very witty, full of emotional moments, and often darkly funny. I guess nobody will ever know what really happened behind the scenes in the week following Diana's death, but I think Morgan tried to make the story as accurate as possible. Also, I liked the film's main theme, tradition vs. modernism, and thought it was quite relevant. Morgan even had the courage to take some stabs at Diana (apparently, how she was an attention-seeking drama queen).<br/><br/>Frears did a great job. He created a fascinating portrayal of the royal family after the tragedy. The only minor problem I had was with Prince Philip. I felt he was a little too cartoonish. The use of real-life footage and integrating characters from the film into them was a masterful decision. It made the film much more real. The film never drags, and is almost always beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>Now, we come to the million-dollar question. Did Helen Mirren deserve winning every single female acting award this year? Well, the answer is pretty simple, and is a big fat YES. She gave a controlled and multi-layered performance. What's even more impressive is that there were no ""big"" acting scenes, Mirren was much more subtle than your typical Oscar winner. I also have to note that Sheen was excellent as the young, enthusiastic, prime minister.<br/><br/>So, I'd definitely recommend seeing The Queen. It's an entertaining, well made, Oscar winning film. It's about one of the biggest tragedies of recent times, and it has some of the best performances of the past year. What more could you ask for?"
"Robert_duder","6","3","5","7 February 2007"," A highly over-rated bashing of the Monarchy
","I am not English, I have very little knowledge of how the current Monarchy affects the English people, and I have no strong political opinions towards the Monarchy or The British Government. That being said people will say of my review that I didn't 'get' The Queen, I didn't understand what was being said and that may be so because I am taking it at face value and I am truly shocked at the overall feeling of love for this film. That being said I am not surprised at the critical acclaim put toward Helen Mirren in her portrayal because it's quite brilliant. Still I feel The Queen was nothing more than a film makers attempt at stating his political opinions on the Monarchy OR and knowing this director it was in effect an opportunity to shock and cause discussion which case in point it has done for me. Director Stephen Frears, an Englishman, is no stranger to direction. In fact he's one of the most talented and versatile directors in the world. He's done everything from Horror/Drama to Period pieces (which in some ways this could be considered.) All being said I thought the film was downright awful to the picture of the Royal Family while attempting to display the new order and world versus a very old, traditional and respected order. The film does a decent job of worshiping Princess Diana and her death and making appropriate digs at the Papparazzi, while still making The Queen out to be cold, distant, traditional, strong willed, Royal, and controlling. Some of these good, some of them bad. On top of all this the pace of the film is very slow. The film clocks in at a measly hour and a half but it often feels like 3 hours.<br/><br/>So what is worth seeing in The Queen?? Well two particular roles stand out for me. First of all you have the infamous Helen Mirren in her second role as Queen in a matter of months. Mirren absolutely transforms herself into Elizabeth and makes her human, and a very strong female lead. She shows emotion, sadness, anger, self reliance...we see her in a way no Queen let alone this Queen has ever been portrayed and it is worthy of an Academy nomination. The second performance is by British actor Michael Sheen, who portrays conservative, moving forward, enormously popular Prime Minister Tony Blair. This is the second time Sheen has performed this part for the same director and it's easy to see why. He nails Blair in every aspect, his tone, his noteworthy smile, his politics, his forcefulness and his gentle side all at once. Sheen is robbed from not being nominated because his performance was equally as great as Mirren's. James Cromwell, who I really do like, portrays Prince Phillip, the Queen's husband and he is portrayed as a loud mouth, hard talking, and overshadowed husband and is even suggested at one point that he has had affairs on his Queen. (This is up for debate of course.) Cromwell is a great actor under the hands of a great director and script and sadly I think his character got the bitter end of this deal. He says a lot but means little to the story. Sylvia Syms is good as The Queen Mother, sassy, outspoken, and shows a little of the traditional style that brought up Queen Elizabeth. Alex Jennings plays Prince Charles and shows my point about how this film wishes to portray the Royal Family. Charles is portrayed as a sniveling, weak, fickle Prince who wants nothing more than to side with the popular people of the time. He certainly shows no strength in the role although has some of the mannerisms down. The supporting cast are all decent enough but even the Queen's supporters truly don't add any argument to the negative portrayal of The Royal Family.<br/><br/>I don't mind if a film is political or tries to show a certain view point. I suppose I was just taken aback as to how truly almost satirical the film was towards The Royal Family. They even joke at one point about The Queen 'greasing Diana's brakes.' The entire family comes across as flippant about Diana's death, and downright cruel at parts. Their behavior is revolting and if this is an accurate portrayal of The Royal Family, Britain better start an uprising soon because they are nasty!! Still The Queen is a tolerable film just simply slow moving and a little shocking if you go into it expecting to see some sort of tribute to The Queen and her days handling Diana's death. Some of the visuals in the film of The English Countryside are breath taking and the shots of real footage used for Diana's Mourners are equally astounding. Overall there is nothing impressive about The Queen and it won't stay in my mind for long. Sorry folks. 6/10"
"bumfrombrooklyn1","10","3","5","22 December 2006"," One of the best films of 2006
","I rarely write a comment for the IMDb, but when I do it's usually after seeing a film like this.. I've got to start with the acting here. I was enraptured by the performances (not to mention the uncanny resemblances), and without them this film might not stand on its two feet. The perfect balance between the performances, the premise and telling of this story, the cinematography and production design I think are what makes this into what it is. Mirren gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Queen Elizabeth, and I find this to be one of the best female characters and performances I have seen since Frances McDormand in Fargo. There is a subtlety to all of these performances, which I always admire, I think it is easy to get cheap laughs and cheap sentiment from films, but what affects me is when the actors restrain themselves, and the director restrains himself, and I think they did this perfectly here. There is a stunning scene that illustrates this point, when Elizabeth, the determined, stubborn 'old fool' as one character calls her decides to drive a Jeep herself through rough terrain on her estate and gets stuck in a river. It is at this point in her story that she breaks down crying, with her back turned to the camera (an earlier scene shows Tony Blair, having just been elected Prime Minister, being told how to behave in front of Elizabeth on their first meeting, and one rule is to never turn his back to her). She then spies a stag on the countryside in the central shot of the film, and immediately collects herself and stops crying. She cries not because her Jeep broke down, but because of the massive assault on her routine, her seemingly private life, that has occurred during the course of the story, and the stag I think represents the grace, honor and dignity that she so fiercely protects. So when she discovers someone has shot the stag for game, she tracks down the beheaded animal, you can't help but make the connection between the animal and her position as queen. If you know nothing about the royal family, Princess Diana, Blair and his relationship to the Queen and the monarchy, that should not stop you from seeing this film, and it should fill you in on a lot of details if you are not. I'm not sure even after seeing this what is fact and what is embellished (but I get the feeling that this was vigorously researched), and it might even inspire you to learn more about those relationships after viewing. The point is, this is entirely self contained, and whatever relationship it has to reality doesn't really matter in a film like this. Incredible."
"DavidSim240183","10","4","8","29 September 2006"," An insightful look inside the mind of the Monarchy
","31st August, 1997. This date marked one of the most memorable events in the history of the entire Royal Family. The death of Princess Diana. It in turn lead to one of the most turbulent weeks the world had ever seen. The Queen, one of the most daring films in recent memory, exposes both sides to this situation, providing a fresh perspective on Diana's untimely death, from the Royals and the public's point of view.<br/><br/>The Queen begins before Diana's death, when Tony Blair (a spookily accurate performance from Michael Sheen) has just been made Prime Minister. His first meeting with HRH Queen Elizabeth II (brought spectacularly to life by Helen Mirren) is actually quite amusing. He is so nervous when he first meets her, he even goes so far as to kneel in her presence. Her Majesty casually dismisses this, even when she meets Cherie Blair (Helen McCrory) who hilariously curtsies before her.<br/><br/>Tony Blair had many grand ideas for the future of Britain. But three months later, after having just gotten used to the idea of being called PM, he finds himself in a very awkward position, caught between his loyalties to the Royal Family, and his duties to the public, after Diana's shocking death, along with her lover Dodi Fayed.<br/><br/>At that point in time, Diana was officially no longer a member of the Royal Family. In fact it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say she had become a source of embarrassment to the family. But when she died, it stirred up an enormous public outcry. The Queen tastefully recreates the events leading up to her death, complete with news reports, interviews and so on.<br/><br/>People would leave bouquets outside Buckingham Palace. It's almost astonishing seeing the reactions it elicited from people the world over. But HRH took a different stance. She knew that Diana had caused no end of problems with some of her antics, and she regarded her death as something she partly brought on herself. Even though the people as a whole blamed the media, who hounded Diana constantly, and were even present when she died, chasing her into the tunnel in Paris that she never emerged from.<br/><br/>But Queen Elizabeth was not so blind that she didn't have some self-doubt. She even openly admits to Prince Philip (pompously played by James Cromwell) the family may have contributed to her death. The RF's insistence on a private ceremony infuriated the public. They began to interpret their reactions as unfeeling. Alistair Campbell didn't hesitate to sensationalise the events and was in partly responsible for whipping the public up into a frenzy. Blair, in the unenviable position of catering to the RF and the public, tries to calm the oncoming storm.<br/><br/>The Queen really is a quite sensational film. Thought-provoking, disturbing, funny, and even moving. At barely 100 minutes, it manages to address a diverse number of angles and events following the natural progression of the aftermath of Diana's death.<br/><br/>Stephen Frears direction is exceptional, tightly constraining the minutiae of the effect Diana had on the world. It's not a one sided affair either. We see things from different facets of society. Blair is afraid the RF is turning a blind eye to what's going on, while HRH maintains her dignity, but tries to spare her grandsons the pain, while privately confiding in The Queen Mother (amusingly played by Sylvia Syms) her own inner doubts.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren is outstanding as the Queen. She holds attention every time she is on the scene. You are never in any doubt who she is supposed to be playing, and she manages to introduce an appealing sense of dry irony at the events. She is also a moving character.<br/><br/>Her best scene is when she is driving on her estate by herself, she breaks down, and while she waits for help, she sees a stag Philip has been hunting. It gives her some time with her thoughts, away from the prying eyes of the public and flashbulbs of the press. She shows actual sadness over the death of her daughter. Despite the differences they had. Its a key moment because HRH senses the Monarchy's tenure is at stake. As well as her standing among the public. Its a scene that opens itself up to any number of interpretations.<br/><br/>One thing that is surprising is the humour that crops up in an otherwise serious motion picture. Some scenes are hilarious, like Blair's clumsy attempts to impress the Queen when they first meet, the strict protocols he must observe when in her presence, the unforgettable sight of seeing him in a football shirt. The delights just go on and on.<br/><br/>It's a consistently engaging experience, giving us a fascinating insight into the Royal Family's feelings, humanising them, and showing us they are real people after all. You even sympathise with what Tony Blair must have had to go through to get the Queen to deliver that address to the nation in the end.<br/><br/>I've seen The Queen twice at the pictures already, and it's rare nowadays that I do that. If Helen Mirren doesn't win an Oscar for her performance, it will be criminal. But then I lost faith in the award ceremonies a long time ago, so we'll have to see what happens. With the help of an excellent ensemble cast, The Queen becomes one of the most interesting films to emerge from the UK about the Monarchy's relationship with politics and the public.<br/><br/>One of the best films of the year."
"docring","Null","5","11","4 February 2007"," A huge movie about a relatively small incident
","Although the death of Princess Diana is lamentable, and although the people of England were disturbed by the royal reaction to it, there are many more important things going on in the world in need of elucidation by the movie industry! It is true that Helen Mirren's acting was flawless. But all I, as an American, came away with is the absurdity of royalty. All the bowing and scraping shown in the movie points up the fact that humans deliberately subject themselves to being demeaned. In the scene where the Queen comes back to Buckingham Palace and walks down the row of flowers, and then walks past the people standing at the barrier, it was disturbing to see women bowing to her. With the war in Iraq, with 47 million Americans with no health care and all the other problems we face, one would think the movie industry would find a more important topic to tackle."

","Premise: The old world conflicting perspectives and Elizabeth II has to perform her duty as the Queen of England. <br/><br/>The film features Helen Mirren in the lead role as Queen Elizabeth II and captures the dilemma that engulfed the royal family after the heartbreaking demise of the most loved royalties of England, Princess Diana. The dilemma of the Queen and the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair was about finding a middle ground on how to behave openly over the misfortune. At this point, the highly confidential and secluded lives of royalties would conflict with the masses desire to see an overt display of grief. <br/><br/>After the Princess's demise in a ghastly auto-accident in September of 1997, it became clear that the masses were not happy with the Royals
.
This film created by Stephen Frear basically offers a narrative that builds up to The Deal. The Deal is a television drama that was written by Peter Morgan and directed by Frears. It captures the interplay between the former PM, Tony Blair and his successor Gordon Brown. Renowned welsh actor, Michael Sheen gave an enigmatic and powerful enactment that showed Blair in his more fashionable, exuberant and youthful shade. This brilliant enactment is complemented by a daring actress who does the seemingly impossible enactment of the Queen, transforming a very confidential celebrity that is shrouded in awe and mystery into a relatable character. Unarguably, the feat Mirren accomplished by her role in this film has set her apart from the clutter as a legend.<br/><br/>Although all of the facts that were used in the representations of Princess Diana in the film Good Night were meticulously gathered from bits and pieces of news, Diana's essence was felt by everyone that saw the film. After a great deal of public outburst and unrelenting demand, a clip of Diana which featured an eerie smile was released. <br/><br/>The best approach to make this into a film is to create a parody. This is film angle was aptly played by a James Cromwell who acted the role of a bad-tempered Duke. Other comical films of royalty, includes Sylvia Syms who acted the role of a chagrinned Queen mother as well as Tim McMullan who played the role of a delightedly spiraling Alastair John, Tony Blair's spokesman. Nonetheless, there are many actual comments from the masses that are very crude and unnerving as some of the written stories. However, these films carry an unintended amount of emotional weight even though most people assume that they are no longer emotionally attached to such matters. A very popular act with the declaration ""I was a mechanic during the war"" from a careworn Queen stranded in wastelands by a damaged central shaft is one excerpt that has been used pervasively. This act gives you the impression that having Helen Mirren as Queen would mean the abandonment of democratic system in England. <br/><br/>The film mirrors our times with stunning accuracy. The conflict between two worlds: new and old generatiWe are in a time where there is an excessive drive for theatrical sensationalism with an unquenchable desire for the scandalous. A way of life that has endured for centuries is now being rattled by a modern craving for exhibitions. The film brings to bear the lingering thought on the issue of the masses desired reaction from England's royalties. Through a line of inquiry of the Queen to the Prime Minister, the film creatively underscored a fundamental issue which was, in fact, the dilemma of the entire scenario. Do we stand in line with an ancient and honorable institution which is the cornerstone of the English way of life and heritage or do we pursue a contemporary response in the form of a public show of grief and compassion from a revered monarchy that has been recklessly reduced to the status of mere celebrity? The head-on collision between these opposing perspectives was revealed in stunning detail in the film.<br/><br/>The film was crafted with a remarkable level of meticulousness and perfection that was further reinforced by one of the most electrifying acting one has ever seen! Mirren and the rest of the cast played their roles in a way that will leave any viewer engrossed. <br/><br/>Helen Mirren, Michael Sheen, James Cromwell and every other actor in the film did a spectacular job. The film was a masterpiece and a lot of kudos goes to the casting. At this point, one would like to make it clear that I have a deep appreciation for the English people who have defended, honored and maintained their cultural pride and ancient institutions even in a contemporary society. Quite frankly, I will certainly be a strong patriot to the monarchs if I were English. Undoubtedly, the film clarified many unattended concerns that have lingered in the minds of the masses for many years now. Most importantly, the film gave a very human perspective to the Queen, making her seem like the mother of England. The highlight of the film was the very engaging dialogues between Cromwell and Sheen coupled with their electrifying acting. Depicted in her very regal and elegant style with the air of mystery and quiet, the Helen played the role in a way that leaves you motionlessly ecstatic. The film moved me to tears many times. The filming quality is one aspect of the film that must be commended. The integration of actual videotapes recordings with the film gave the films a very formidable feel of authenticity."
"Quinoa1984","6","2","3","6 March 2016"," God Saves?
","This rating is probably a little more generous than the film truly deserves, which is a shame since it comes from director Stephen Frears (of The Hit and High Fidelity among many other notables), and of course carries a serious pedigree with not only Helen Mirren but James Cromwell and, the one given the most character to play with Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. They all are in service of a story which is not really that interesting, or as captivating as it thinks it is.<br/><br/>Of course the death of Princess Diana rocked the world with grief - or many parts of it, I can't speak for all if it, I just knew what I saw as a kid on TV at the time - and the whole narrative thrust of this film, which mostly takes place in a week's time give or take a day, is 'What will the Queen DO to respond to this national tragedy?' We're told a lot of things about how the Monarchy usually acts, and especially in this case it was tricky since it was the ""English"" way was to keep grief as a ""personal"" matter (of quiet desperation, Pink Floyd might say, but I'd say more like upper-crust, stuffy reserve is more like it). And, also of course, Diana's life was made anything but impersonal by the media.<br/><br/>I think that how much you personally care about the Monarchy, what you think of its relevance for modern society (as in the past 25/30 years) matters watching The Queen because they are the chief component of it. And from what Frears and company show here, they were very sympathetic; what is it they DO that would keep them away from the (arguably) over-reaching frenzy of the public in their reaction to the Diana tragedy? Well, lots of hunting and walking the dogs and reading newspapers and tea time and other such things. For me, it doesn't exactly make them, or the Queen, seem very conflicted, and that's the problem with the movie.<br/><br/>I actually would have been intrigued to see a Tony Blair movie, just about him, from seeing his work here: Sheen does an excellent job, as does the writing of him, to make Blair much more conflicted and have to deal with he pressures of public perception (and also the fact that he becomes sort of a glowing figurehead with his ""People's Princess"" remark). But his story is squeezed together with this supposed conflict of the Queens, which doesn't make for a terribly compelling arc. For most of the movie she is reluctant/hesitant/won't be in public to mourn, then she sees a giant elk, sheds a tear, and decides to do it. While she starts in one place and ends in another, and does have lots of conversations (like with the ""Queen Mother"", even more of an old-time blue-blood than she), there's too much telling and not enough showing of the change.<br/><br/>Mirren is it goes without saying a tremendous talent, and I understand why the old-stuffy AMPAS gave a figure who was old-stuffy like Queen an Oscar (ironically they didn't give it to the most deserved that year Judy Dench for Notes on a Scandal, I imagine because they might've reasoned she already got hers... for playing Queen Elizabeth for 8 minutes in Shakespeare in Love). But it's not a character that gives the actress too much to do - or, rather, she has to do a *lot* to try and make her at least watchable and have these internal problems to deal with. Maybe they do show up and my own lack of concern for the monarchy showed, but it's also worth as a criticism to point out the movie didn't do enough to make me care as I should.<br/><br/>Perhaps as a longer series this could work better, where we could see Blair and the Queen as (co) protagonists dealing with British affairs in their time (there's a hint about the troubles Blair would come across in the early 2000's as part of the Iraq war effort, at least that's how I read into it). As it stands it's not bad, but it's not terribly memorable either, except as Oscar-baiting regal drama with the occasional wink and nod to the audience about how stuffy this group is. From Frears, I would've expected more though."

","After the death of Princess Diana, HM Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) struggles with her reaction to a sequence of events nobody could have predicted.<br/><br/>I was not one of those who was devastated by the death of Princess Diana. So stories of her life are not terribly appealing to me. This one was different, though, and told the tale from a completely different perspective -- a queen who did not particularly care for her daughter-in-law.<br/><br/>How accurate this, I have no idea. How much of the behind-the-scenes moments happened, who knows? How interesting to look at the royal family in this way, especially when all the key players were still alive."
"pekinman","8","2","3","11 September 2009"," Surprisingly fair assessment of the times
","I was expecting a hatchet job on the royal family when this film was first announced. My interest in seeing it was increased mainly because Helen Mirren was playing Queen Elizabeth II and Stephen Frears was directing. I wasn't sure how Frears views the royal family so I was still anticipating a negative 'take' in the film. <br/><br/>I was very surprised by the final result. Frears gives a pretty fair and unbiased representation of the events surrounding the death of Princess Diana without throwing in too much street legend stuff, such as the popular, at the time, belief that the Queen had had Diana's car booby-trapped, and other such nonsense. And Tony Blair was presented in a most interesting light.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes was when he lashes out at Alastair Campbell (Mark Bazeley) and defends the Queen against the blind bias against all the so-called royal parasites that is promulgated by the mainstream press. Michael Sheen is very good as the Prime Minister and Mark Bazeley's snaky Campbell is utterly loathsome in his Machiovellian manoeuvrings.<br/><br/>It was also gratifying to see Princess Diana presented in a more objective light. Her public image was much different from her real self. Those who knew her, and have written or commented about her, often say that Princess 'Di' was neurotic, manipulative and, some said, quite mad. There is a telling photograph of her near the end of the film that shows her looking side-wise at the camera with a really knowing and nasty look in her eye. She was no angel and it was about time someone had the guts to say it. Frears did this and for that he has risen in my estimation of his cinematic integrity.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren is sensational as the Queen. I also liked the smug, cynical Cherie Blair of Helen McCrory whose home life centers around the kitchen table, with Cherie doing the cooking and Tony the washing-up; at odds with her liberated woman image. She reminded me of Mme. Krupskaya, Lenin's wife; full of ambition and slavish devotion, larded with henpecking pinpricks delivered with balls and impertinence.<br/><br/>The only aspect of this film I did not like was the presentation of the Queen Mother as an alcoholic. She was not an alcoholic, though she, like countless millions of us, liked her cocktails. I thought the emphasis on her drinking was unworthy of the film-makers and certainly undeserved by the late Queen Mother. I have noticed other films involving her character, like 'The Cambridge Spies' also present her as a constantly tippling lush.<br/><br/>It's a good film and provides a lot of unexpected food for thought without slamming a lot of anti-Royalist rubbish in your face. <br/><br/>Something, then, to watch with great pleasure on occasion."
"flavia18","10","2","3","8 December 2008"," Amazing script, even more amazing performances, this film reveals a fundamental truth.
","DEFINITE SPOILERS <br/><br/>This film captured not just the essence of the British Monarchy, but the relationship the British people have with it, and even the national character, not to mention putting everything the public has gleaned (or could have gleaned, had they/we cared to look beyond the immediate) of the British Royal Family, itself.<br/><br/>If you ask the casual observer about the Windsors, s/he may very well parrot Cherie Blair's virulent anti-monarchy remarks about how soulless/shallow/parasitical they are. And the film absolutely shows how out of touch HM is (or, perhaps, seemed) with the thoughts/views/feelings of the modern-day British subject.<br/><br/>However, we must look closer - and the film not just allows us to do so, it does so for us: it is Tony Blair who becomes the vehicle for revealing the truth. He starts off the film feeling as others do, but after seeing HM close up, hearing what she has to say on the subject of propriety & guidance - the 2 things which are demanded most of her - he comes to see not just HM's point of view, but the worth of the Monarchy itself. He starts off by all-but-agreeing with his wife on the subject of the Royal Family - and ends the film by lambasting those who dare to criticize the Queen.<br/><br/>Another way in which HM's vision of Britain is portrayed is through the stag. Prince Philip et al are seen treating the stag as centuries of Britons have treated them: stalking carefully over days, taking care to keep the ""contest"" as level as possible (even if you hate hunting as much as I do, you must understand that this is the intent). And what happens to the stag? A ""commercial guest"" of a once-proud neighboring manor is all-but handed the stag through the careful staging of beaters, still manages to botch the job, and the beaters must finish off the poor animal. I used to think that the stag was Diana, killed through her courting the vulturazzis, who could then not be ""turned off"", but I have come to see that the stag as a metaphor of the British character, damaged through abandoning traditional British ways. Anyone doubting my interpretation has only to look at the undisputed historical facts of the film: even while mourning the woman who seemingly rejected everything for which the Monarchy stands (and mourning her because of that stance), what did the people want? Or, more tellingly, who? They wanted their Queen. Exactly in the manner of grieving children wanting Mommy to come tell them everything will be all right (& this is not meant as an insult to those who felt that way: it is a human condition).<br/><br/>(NOTE: it has come to my attention that the director, himself, has spoken out on the reaction to the film, & particularly this part of it. He has said that the stag was meant to signify the Monarchy, itself, and that the use of an old stag, with an astonishing number of points was deliberate, because, as was made clear in the dialogue, it would normally have been shot long before. But he has also said that this, as well as his entire portrayal of HM & the Monarchy, was NOT meant to be positive, & that he is amazed by how many people felt ""sympathetic"" to the Queen after viewing the movie. So even if I did not grasp what he wanted to say, neither did the bulk of his viewers: What this says to me is that there are some fundamental truths that no movie maker can ever destroy if he is honest in his subjects.)<br/><br/>Helen Mirren, of course, was spectacular. James Cromwell was luckily very good - he looks as much like Prince Philip as any actor could get, so it's a good thing he could pull it off. Michael Sheen was also aided by physical resemblance. One hopes for Cherie Blair's sake that Helen McCrory's interpretation of her was terrible! Prince Charles was captured very well by Alex Jennings: the indecisiveness brought on by years of the Establishment contradicting his thoughts/views/ideas, the frustration at not just that, but in dealing with Diana, or getting anyone to believe his side of the story (that one anguished outburst of ""Now they see what it was like!"", & that Diana's public and private personnae were maddeningly disparate, cut right to the heart of it). Sylvia Sims also evoked the Queen Mother very thoroughly - and I am extremely grateful for and admiring of the director's decision never to show the younger princes in any real detail. It's bad enough we eavesdrop on the elders - they should be allowed as much privacy as possible. After all, a good deal of film was about their privacy - and what lack of privacy can do to a person.<br/><br/>I watch this film over and over - it's riveting."

With dialog and scenes that obviously take large liberties with the truth but remains quite non-judgmental in tone.<br/><br/>Scores intriguing looks behind the scenes of power & celebrity worshiping, that underlines my own opinion that monarchy, as such, is seriously to be questioned in a modern, democratic world.

","The closing shots of The Queen will have you smiling, acknowledging the fact that what comes next in chronological history is what has shaped my country, England, in the last decade as Tony Blair (Sheen) and Queen Elizabeth the Second (Mirren) walk off together through her gardens. It'll have you smiling in recognition that what followed is part of history, part of a history you will have lived through and remembered; after all, what is ten years amongst the vast centuries of history? I think I had such a connection, such a link, to The Queen because Diana's death occurred at a time where I was not too young to remember it happen, nor was I too young to acknowledge how important an event it was. I will remember exactly where I was when I saw it on the morning news after another family member decided to turn on the television for the mere sake of it. I may have been too young to know exactly who Diana was but the general consensus that something truly terrible had happened to someone who truly didn't deserve it was inescapable; the atmosphere and feel of that time is captured perfectly in this film by director Frears be it down to use of news coverage resurrecting nostalgic emotions deep within me or merely down to the mise-en-scene used in the form of props: then England manager Glenn Hoddle on the back of a newspaper and a Sony Playstation complete with games and controller in view at various points.<br/><br/>I recently saw a film entitled JFK which I learnt after seeing was also Oscar nominated for best picture in its respective year. Like JFK, all the British will remember where they were and what they were doing when they learnt of Diana's death ¬ñ it was an event that hit the American's like Kennedy's death, I'm sure. I think I enjoyed JFK at the level I did because of this film, since it brings out feelings of nostalgia and sadness at once; sort of like the feeling you might get when you look at a photograph of a deceased loved one. The Queen as a film manages to remain extremely authentic, mainly down to its mise-en-scene mentioned earlier, without feeling too much like a send up or a spoof; people who have ever seen an episode of Spitting Image or one of Rory Bremner's Tony Blair impersonations will know what I mean. What can be funny in The Queen is strictly kept to a surreal and constructive level; there is the acknowledgment of memory that makes you smirk every now and again but there is also something rather amusing about watching apparent members of the royal family squabble over things like who wants to watch the television.<br/><br/>I think there are several little coded undercurrent swimming around beneath The Queen's surface. First of all, we must remember what the film is entitled: it's called 'The Queen' despite its subject matter and extremely heavy emphasis on Lady Diana's death. To call Diana's death a 'MacGuffin' would perhaps be a too colloquial expression but the film brilliantly uses it as its backdrop to its events; rather than focus on setting or time, the film lets the found footage of the news and such to place you there rather than feed you establishing shots and crane shots scanning the vast locales of the film. Yes, notice how it is entitled The Queen and notice how it never allows Diana to take over as the focus for the film; it may be about her and her immediate aftermath but it is The Queen's and the royal family's reaction that will dictate where the film will go ¬ñ Frears never allows the two to cross contaminate.<br/><br/>Then there is Tony Blair to consider. Whilst brilliantly acted, there is more to his performance and character than it seems. Blair announces that he is the new deal; he is the ultimate piece of modernity in terms of politics and world leaders: young, laid back and with children old enough to go to school. ""Just call me Tony"" is the way the expression goes, I believe. This is where the counterbalance occurs because for the duration of the film, Blair and the Queen are at loggerheads with one another with Blair frequently pointing out what it is he think the Royals should do but the Queen had none of it. Here is the old vs. the new; the modern vs. the traditional clashing at full stretch. This is further emphasised by the spaces they inherit: the royals are in fancy places with vast open rooms whereas Tony is in an office, sleeves rolled up and telling the Queen that he believes it to be ""his duty"" to suggest such actions. The Queen Mother may think him a silly man but he is daring to challenge the binary opposite of himself in terms of power.<br/><br/>The Queen is a clever film that will evoke emotion to some degree but will not have you crying your eyes out; it's clever like that. It will allow you nostalgia on a certain level but it will never bombard you, favouring etching out memory instead out and out tears before bedtime. What with an extremely authentic look, brilliant acting and a piece of iconography represented through a great stag as the Queen realises the value of life and what she must do when she sees it for a final time, the film is a big winner in almost every department."

","From Academy Award nominated director Stephen Frears comes The Queen, the story of the untimely death of Princess Diana and the toll it placed on Queen Elizabeth of England and her royal subjects. Helen Mirren plays the beautiful monarch in the most spot on biopic performance of the 2006.<br/><br/>Writer Peter Morgan, responsible for penciling The Last King of Scotland, makes this rather short film everything to gander and awe at. The dialogue is completely engaging never leaving the viewer outside the room rather, inviting us in to this tragic time of loss and accountability.<br/><br/>Mirren as stated before, brings her best performance of her career. Within the subtlety of Queen Elizabeth lies the torment and frustration of a powerful woman thrust into a difficult situation. Besides bringing forth a strange and eerie resemblance of the woman, Mirren doesn't just imitate like other actors tend to do, she inhabits the woman, both inside and out. The subtlety is quite beautiful and quite intimidating and the viewer feels awkward while viewing Ms. Mirren on screen. Not since her overrated performance in Robert Altman's Gosford Park, has Helen Mirren been so good.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen, who has been nearly invisible in Hollywood plays the Prime Minister Tony Blair. Sheen, also with his subtlety shows power and compassion in the most powerful of scenes. There is no screaming or yelling, just plain nuisance and anxiety. As he tries to save the Queen from herself, he embodies a man that is completely familiar to the audience and shines in his most tender moments. What Sheen brings is much charisma and a strong likability factor that lacks often in films, especially when it's a biopicture.<br/><br/>You can easily tell that director Stephen Frears has a high admiration for the Queen of England. To make a film where nothing really happens, seem like everything just happened is a triumph. And that's what The Queen is, a triumph, that is exquisitely acted and powerfully written. Along with Alexandre Desplat's score that adds tension to each scene, this film is easily one of the best films of 2006.<br/><br/>Grade: ***¬Ω/****"

","Most of the movie takes place during the week Princess Diana died and what followed. Diana was divorced from Prince Charles, and the Royal Family had emotionally divorced her, even though she was the mother of a future King of England. When her unfortunate accidental death in Paris occurred, the Royal Family simply wanted it treated as a private matter by Diana's family. But England and the world would have none of that.<br/><br/>Tony Blair was the popular, young, recently elected Prime Minister. In early scenes we are clearly shown that he serves at the pleasure of the Queen, even though he was elected by the people. In a brief meeting with the Queen in her quarters, she must request that he serve as Prime Minister. However, during the week of Diana's death and funeral, Blair is the one who shows wisdom, who ends up telling the Queen what she must do to avoid a rebellion of sorts. While the movie focuses alternately on Diana, Tony Blair, and Queen Elizabeth, the title of the movie is ""The Queen"" and that is its main focus, how the Queen changed as a result of that fateful week. And realized how the world had changed.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren won a well-deserved Oscar for her role as The Queen. Michael Sheen was equally effective as Tony Blair. James Cromwell does a competent turn as Prince Philip and Alex Jennings as Prince Charles, who apparently sympathized more with the people than with his mother.<br/><br/>Good movie!! <br/><br/>SPOILERS. There is an episode regarding a majestic, 14-point buck on the 40,000 acre property of the Royal Family. The Queen's vehicle breaks down crossing a river bed, and the buck appears. Later the buck is killed and she visits the corpse hanging for dressing. She is told how it had been wounded, and eventually chased hunted it down and finished it off. And that is what happened to Diana."

Her Oscar was well deserved."
"Derek237","10","2","3","18 January 2007"," It could have been a melodramatic TV movie; instead, it exceeds any and all expectations and is one of the best films of 2006
","Queen Elizabeth's actions in response to ex-HRH's Diana's tragic death were held in such a crucial regard that the very Monarchy was is jeopardy. I didn't know this. If information like this doesn't interest you in the slightest, you might not enjoy The Queen as much as I did. Either way, this is an excellent drama. It is framed between two different meetings between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth. The first meeting is when Blair first becomes Prime Minister, the second meeting occurs a good deal of time after the turbulent week following Diana's death. This is a wonderful film about the changing of times and values, about crucial decisions, and about the importance of compromise. The process of the film is really remarkable. It takes something that essentially could have been a Hallmark movie of the week, but it rises so far above it: there is a lack of pretension in its urgent, quiet scenes. It is a sincere film with a valuable political message that is not at all preachy. I'd compare this to 2005's Good Night, and Good Luck.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the performances here are pitch perfect. Hellen Mirren, obviously, leads the show with a performance that is sure to win her an Oscar. It's more than just imitation of a public figure. She gives life to this role and creates a strong, genuine character. And how sad is it that these days in mainstream movies we have to have an actress play a QUEEN in order to display any kind of strength? It's nice to see a strong female character that isn't overcoming sexism, or the supportive wife/girlfriend, or enduring unimaginable suffering, or battling aliens or vampires. Mirren is just simply breathtaking: she's intimidating, but also warm, and is always true to the character. There is one scene in which she breaks down and cries, but wisely to the part of the filmmakers, we only see her with her back facing the camera.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is terrific as well. There isn't a single actor or actress in the main cast that doesn't steal the show at some point. James Cromwell plays the frustrated Prince Philip wonderfully(""Look at them, pulling out their hair and sleeping in the streets for someone they've never even met-- and they call US mad!""). Slyvia Syms provides some delightfully unexpected comedic relief as the Queen Mother. And just as Mirren perfectly embodies Queen Elizabeth, Michael Sheen also does so with Tony Blair, in a great supporting role for which I hope he also gets an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The Queen much deserves the praise its been getting. It is actually a very surprising film. You may expect a melodrama, but you would be completely wrong. You may expect to not be interested in its politics but they are more accessible than you may initially think. Whether you like the movie or not, though, there is no disputing the greatness of Mirren's performance. I hope she wins an Oscar this year: after the perky blonde winning last year, I think it's time for Mirren to distinguish the line between movie star and accomplished actress and bring home her gold.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"
"cadre2002-1","10","2","3","15 September 2006"," The Passion of the Queen
","Stephen Frears demonstrates, as he did most especially in Dangerous Liasons, his complete artistic and technical mastery of the medium. The performances are excellent and Helen Mirren is quite simply as good as it gets. This is a unique film, deeply personal in a way to most Brits, and almost enters that realm beyond criticism in which The Passion of the Christ existed for those who appreciated it. Revisiting the Diana death week, and revealing our monarch, in most hands would have been vulgar sentimental porn at best. How lucky we are - truly fortunate as cinema goers - to have someone of such profound, questioning and considerate genius as Frears at the helm. I for one am touched and surprised that such consummate, classical artistry is still possible. Mr Frears, though it may not be your desire, I doff my cap to you."

","Once Princess Diana had been killed, there were expectations of the Queen of England. But instead of putting herself out there, she took the family and went into hiding. What this movie is about is how Great Britain began to want answers. We are made privy to the fact that the British press can be ruthless, especially the tabloids. Things get bad and Prime Minister Tony Blair comes on the scene. The Royals are incredibly resentful of this, particularly Prince Philip. The movie, and especially Helen Mirren, show us the fact that these are humans, even though they carry the weight of history. This is not a biography of the Queen. It involves those events following a tragedy."
"Shanghai_Samurai","9","1","1","8 March 2019"," Whew Helen Mirren
","I gave The Queen a second viewing more than ten years later - the events of Princess Diana's passing coming back into personal memory with surprising lucidity. A slew of films and tv shows featuring monarchs through the ages has somewhat saturated our minds with what it means to be a royal, perhaps, but witnessing The Queen in almost documentarian realism sobers our fancies. Helen Mirren, rightfully awarded, puts on a depiction of a generation - the strong supporting cast appear incidental. Who knows if this is the persona of the Queen - does it matter now that we have the telling of events so truthfully brought to life that it may as well be the reality of something we certainly won't know in full."

","A perfect example of a masterpiece rising from the ashes of tragedy, Helen Mirren's legendary portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II as she comes to terms with the death of Princess Diana (Laurence Burg) is a timeless and powerful piece. There is a majestic subtlety to Mirren's performance at the heart of what is essentially a character study of the Royal Family during one of their darkest moments, and the use of live news footage from 1997 helps to fully immerse the audience in the real life drama of the story. As such, Mirren's performance acts to elevate the Queen beyond the countless hats and coats, the waves from the balcony, the smiles from the carriage that we as the public see and presents us with Elizabeth Alexandra Mary the wife, mother and grandmother."

","31 January 2007. Helen Mirren offers up a fabulous and intimate possible version of the current Queen of England who must balance between tradition and modernization upon the election of Tony Blair, the new prime minister with new ideas and the impending tragic death of Princess Diana. This movie provides a whole new fictional but possible insight into the behind the scenes politics and emotional tension of the Royal family as well as a fascinating look at the role of Britain's prime minister. Mirren's performance is both deeply moving and sophisticated, intimate and unexpectedly casual and refined. The smooth editing of Princess Diana's actual footage and other background events, along with the cast performances creates an elegant, compelling, and truly brilliant cinematic experience. Except for the casting of the Queen's husband that detracted from the natural film experience, the movie was nearly perfect. Nine out of Ten Stars."
"ablack90","10","1","1","25 May 2018"," Watched it 3 times
","I've watched The Queen 3 times and I'm not even a fan of ""royalty"". Helen Mirren's acting is so incredible in this film. Saying everything without a word. Whether you like royalty or not, this film is deeply nuanced with layers of different people's truths. The story line follows Tony Blair's involvement with Queen Elizabeth immediately following Princess Diana's death. Their relationship is very sweet. Two worlds colliding, the past with the now. <br/><br/>I could feel the burden Queen Elizabeth carried, as she became queen at a very young age and gave her whole life to service and restraint. Because of this restraint, the public never really knew what goes on behind closed doors. The public never knew the Diana the royal family knew. It is sacrilege to say anything negative about Diana, but she had to go through her growing and healing pains, married off at 18 into a world wholly unprepared and still carrying skeletons of her childhood. The queen and Prince Charles were ill equipped to help her. <br/><br/>There is no ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"" in this film. Just characters being true to what shaped them. And masterfully shows that change can happen through relationship with one another. Lovely film that I'll likely watch a 4th time."
"Mike_Devine","8","1","1","11 March 2018"," Mirren steals the show as 'The Queen'
","When thinking about which actress is tailor-made to play Great Britain's reigning head of state - Queen Elizabeth II - there is a very short list of names that one can put together. Chief among them is Helen Mirren, and the legendary actress got her chance to portray what is perhaps the role of a lifetime in 2006's 'The Queen.'<br/><br/>The film looks behind the curtains of Buckingham and Balmoral to show the royal family's thought process and sparring with newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) in the hours and days following the tragic death of Princess Diana - ""the People's Princess."" This glimpse into a circle of people that is rarely possible is what many found to be the main draw in the best picture-nominated film, and while there is an all-star cast here (James Cromwell as Prince Philip, Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother and Alex Jennings as Prince Charles), Mirren's first-rate delivery of Elizabeth II's calculating, cold demeanor during this period in her life is really what everyone is here for - and the Academy agreed, handing Mirren a gold statue for best performance by an actress in a leading role.<br/><br/>While it's true that Mirren steals every scene she's in, Sheen's portrayal of Blair is also to be respected. The rivalry that forms between the two, including the divergence in the public's perception of them, is clearly evident, but as only the Brits can do, they disagree with class. Another element that makes 'The Queen' a powerful film is its soundtrack. Alexandre Desplat proves once again why he is a go-to for soundtracks of serious dramas.<br/><br/>'The Queen' is another reminder that audiences are fascinated with royalty, and how a great film can be created by focusing on angle and side of a well-known event that few were aware of."

After watching this movie, I found myself transported into the mindset of the Queen. What she came from, in a world where she had gone through so much change, so many rules had to be rewritten and she struggled to cope. With the help from newly elected PM, Tony Blair, she battled through the change to keep her family safe. One of the last lines in the movie hit me hard, ""I've never been hated before."" You can't keep everyone happy, and you can't be seen to be weak.

If you are looking for a film for the weekend which you learn from at the same time, this film will be perfect. The film 'The Queen', is based on an original play written by Peter Morgan. The leading role the Queen, the head of the United Kingdom, is played by Helen Mirren. The drama deals with the tragic death of Lady Diana and the reaction of Queen Elisabeth II. As Diana dies in a car accident in Paris, the Queen decides against a royal funeral besides that she hasn't give any comment. The population don't understand this reaction and react with criticism. The new Primeminister Tony Blair addresses to the public and takes an emotional speech. <br/><br/>As far as the characters are concerned, you will find it easy to identify with Queen Elisabeth II. She can be characterized as a strict woman, who learned to control her emotions and shows that she is the head of the state. She surprises the viewer when she shows her emotions and starts to cry, this is shown in the scene when the Queen is in the nature and admires the deer. The plot of the film is the follows: It is set in August 1997 in the United Kingdom, Lady Diana's deadly car accident puts the country in a state of shock. But the Queen cannot and does not want to join the public mourning so she escapes from the public into Balmoral Castle and she doesn't give a statement.<br/><br/>The public and the media have no understanding for her reaction.

In contrast with this the Royal Family and especially the Queen don't show any emotions. They go on a journey to Balmoral to have some time on their own. There you can see the Queen showing her emotion the first time in a moment when she's alone. People expect the Queen to deliver a speech about Diana's death and to show her emotions. They want the Queen to support them with Diana's death and to grieve for Diana. The Queen does not do any of these things. She wants to spend some time with her family and to hold Diana's sons off the publicity.

It's a great film you will never forget because it's a great mix of drama and documentary. It tells the story of the royal lives after the death of princess Diana as ""people's princess"" in 1997 and it shows how the Queen gets problems when she tries to protect the royal family from the media to manage the loss of Diana.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, you see how the Queen is introduced as a strong and honest woman who is rather shown as the head of state than a human being. But this changes in the course of the movie when the Queen is confronted with the reactions of the media and her family members after Lady Diana's death,she gets a private face. Then, you see how Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as the new elected Prime Minister meets the Queen. You will find out how different their understandings of doing business are. The Queen is practising politics the way it's always been done by her but Tony Blair wants to change some things in the politics. You will see that in the course of the action her way of practising politicts will change. After the death of Lady Di, the Queen wants to protect the royals from the media and she moves to Balmoral with other royals to manage the loss of Diana. But in the course of the film, you will be informed that she has to take criticism from the media and from the nation for being so emotionless, when she moves to Balmoral. In the end of the film, the Queen makes a statement on the death of Lady Di by showing her compassion and her emotions. You have to know that this happen because of the help of Tony Blair.

","If you are interested in the events after Lady Diana's death, you should watch ""The Queen"". This film is set in the days following the death of Diana in 1997. ""The Queen"" (2006, Great Britain) is a brilliant historical drama film directed by Stephen Frears and written by Peter Morgan. It tells about the reactions of the British public and those of the Royal Family after the death of the Princess of Wales. While the public reacted with grief and sadness, the Royal Family neither gave any statement nor showed any emotions to the public. After Princess Diana's death, Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) has been censured as heartless. This movie shows the reasons of the Queen's behaviour and exposes the hidden emotions behind her facade. <br/><br/>The beginning of the movie shows Tony Blair running for Prime Minister. His role is an important one because he later changes the course of the action when he tries to convince the Queen of a statement that pays tribute to Diana. During the elections, the Queen is shown in her daily routine. She would like to have the right to elect, so she tells her portraitist. Queen Elizabeth can be characterized as the head of state who attaches great importance to the protocol and etiquette. The plot of the film is as follows: The Queen always preferred to keep her emotions to herself. She was brought up this way. Because of the importance she attaches to the protocol, she does not let the flag fly at half-staff over the palace after Diana's death. The flag only shows that the Queen is in residence. Because of the fact that the Queen goes with her family to Balmoral, the way it was planed before Lady Di's death, there is not any reason for flying the flag at half-staff. But the Queen is also criticized for going to Balmoral and not helping her country grieve. Of course, the Royal Family is entitled to go for a short period of time to Balmoral. Prince William and Prince Harry have lost their mother and they need their grandparents at this time. The Queen is also a grandmother and she has to be there for her family. When she is alone, she cries and lets her emotions out in spite of her strong appearance. This is perhaps the most memorable scene in the film, when she sits by the river all by herself. But to find out how the film ends you have to watch it yourself. <br/><br/>In terms of language, the film is kept in a British style. Actress Helen Mirren plays the title role of the Queen in a very convincing way. She shows through her facial expressions her internal discontentment, hidden by her external strength.<br/><br/>To conclude, I can only strongly recommend this film because it shows the time after Diana's death from another perspective. Those who criticized the Queen for her behaviour will get another view of the choice of the Queen to act the way she did. This film is surely worth seeing because of its historical facts and authentic scenery. It is full of different characters and points of view, so it is very interesting to see for those who do not care about Diana or who is against monarchy and wants to abolish it by the very first opportunity. If I was asked to rate this film on a scale from zero to ten, I would give it nine points. It is worth watching!"

","""The Queen"" is a historical drama movie released in the year 2006 by Stephen Frears Helen Mirren in the leading role. Princess Diana dies in a car accident in Paris. After the royal family hear about her tragic death, Queen Elizabeth II. (Helen Mirren) decides that this should be treated privately because it is the best for Princess Diana's two boys, Prince William and Prince Harry. The upset public cannot understand it and demand a public funeral. The new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) tries to convince the Queen because Princess Diana was the ""People's Princess"".<br/><br/>The new elected Prime Minister Tony Blair prepares to meet Queen Elizabeth II. He is very nervous and shaky. The Queen does not like Blair's thinking of modernizing Britain and the monarchy but he repeatedly says that he respects the royal family. A few month later the Princess of Wales, Princess Diana, dies in a tragic car accident in Paris. Tony Blair's PR-Director Alastair Campbell (Mark Bazeley) immediately writes a speech for the Prime Minister which touches the people. In it he calls her the ""People's Princess"". The citizens so demand a public funeral but the Queen and her husband Prince Philip (James Cromwell), who are in a residence in Balmoral with Diana's two boys, are strictly against it. Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), Diana's ex-husband, does not agree with his mother's and his father's opinion. He quietly tries to push Prime Minister Tony Blair to convince the Queen to make a public funeral. And he succeeds; the Queen recognizes that there has been a shift in the public values so she accepts Blair's demands. The monarchy and the royal family regain popularity and so does Prime Minister Blair. The cast of the film is really excellent. Especially Helen Mirren, nominated for an Oscar for her role as ""the Queen"", shows a lot of variety. In one scene she is strict and tough and in the others she shows emotions and humanity. The viewer can easily identify with her. The language of the movie though is on a very high level, like politicians often use. But this should not stop you from watching it. It is a very dramatic movie for all ages. The movie offers a nice plot, an excellent Helen Mirren and beautiful pictures."
"sashank_kini-1","9","1","1","20 June 2012"," In the words of Peter Morgan, hands of Stephen Frears and instruments in the form of a great cast, The Queen is an important character study in the form of a biography
","It is a general belief that oldsters cherish the values and customs that they have grown up with while youngsters on the other hand rebel and boot established norms. Your grandfather may constantly scold you for your irregular sleeping habit while you would constantly justify it by reminding him how busy you are. This nature has been seen since time immemorial and will be seen in the future. In 'The Queen', Cherie Blair, Mr. Tony Blair's wife saucily reminds her husband about his mother while they debate about the relevance of monarchy, calling her 'old-fashioned', 'rigid'. On the other hand, in the opening scene, an aged painter, while making Queen Elizabeth's portrait, confides in her that he hasn't voted for Blair since he doesn't believe in 'modernizing'. The Queen smugly reminds him that in the end, she is the one to ratify. This establishment versus modification between the royalty (the old) and the common people (the new) is what sets the tone of The Queen. I asked my grandfather whether he felt Lady Di was entitled to a public funeral, to which he replied that it was the Queen's private matter. On the other hand, many youngsters (and under 50 is young) would feel the Queen is being vindictive.<br/><br/>'The Queen' captures what possibly went inside the four walls of the Royal family and Tony Blair's home and office. If one observes the attire itself, it is noticeable how regally the Royal family dresses even when in bedroom while Blair sports jaunty tee-shirts. When the Queen meets Blair, the latter, who isn't very accustomed to the protocol, smiles stupidly when he flubs up at one point during the meeting. Till here, everything seems formal and distant, and we know less about both the characters. But when the tragedy occurs, we are taken right into the center of action. It is then that we feel the actual tension that runs on both sides, and we get to see how Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair react and respond, to their families, their associates and the public.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren, an acting God, should share the space with heavyweights like Brando because she is able to find a path to make her characters entirely convincing without having the need to draw attention towards her technique. Her contemporary Meryl Streep too has that capacity but her Iron Lady sometimes became 'Oh, did that thing with her lower lip just like Thatcher!' or 'Look how she conveys shivers by lowering her neck and bringing it forward!'; Mirren played with her pearls, spoke with slight disconcert and humiliation during the televised speech just like Queen Elizabeth but never made us draw comparisons with the real Queen while watching the film because we believed, at least for the runtime of about 100 minutes, that she was Queen Elizabeth. Her character is beleaguered not only by the public, the media and Tony Blair, but also by her own family who, with the exception of Prince Charles, consent with her stance about a private funeral. The moment she acquiesces with Tony Blair, they frown and take her to task. On the other hand, Blair reminds her that by resisting his advice, she would blacken her own reputation. Helen Mirren conveys her character's dilemma with dignity, demureness and valor, and the only moment she breaks down (along with her jeep) is when she is absolutely alone. The camera does not pan at her face then because she doesn't want ""anyone"" to intrude then.<br/><br/>The stag scene is pivotal in the film, an abstruse allegory to Princess Diana's death and Queen Elizabeth's compassion. The stag is a beautiful creature that Queen Elizabeth encounters during her breakdown. While admiring its majesty, a gunshot is heard in the distance but the stag doesn't move. The queen tries to shoo it away before it gets killed and it leaves when a dog barks in the background. The Queen feels relieved after this incident, only to find out that it was killed in a neighboring area. She visits the place alone, sheds a tear, tells the person there to convey her regards to the new owner and leaves. (i) This situation may allude to Princess' death with the stag signifying Di who left to Paris, a neighboring area and got killed over there or (ii) in one of the earlier scenes, as Queen walks down the hallway with I think Robin Janvrin behind her, the camera is at almost ground level and titled toward the air. On the top of the walls, the heads of stags can be seen affixed. Later, the Queen's compassionate attitude towards the stag seems like a contrast to her former attitude.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast helps in achieving cracking chemistry with each other, avoiding the talky film to slip into boredom. Michael Sheen as Tony Blair may sound childish and artificial sometimes in his delivery but for most part is convincing. Sylvia Syms is wise, witty and nutty as Queen Mother, and so is Helen McCrory as Cherie. More than the cast, scriptwriter Peter Morgan should be credited for his glorious and immaculate work, which helped the characters slip naturally into their roles and create dramatic tension. The symbolism is subtle and meaningful unlike the embarrassing metaphors in Iron Lady (""Right-o!"" says Thatcher and swerves the car to the wrong side of the road just to hint her political inclination. Then there is the scene with 'milk cartons'. How tacky!).<br/><br/>In the words of Peter Morgan, hands of a great director (Stephen Frears) and instruments in the form of a great cast, The Queen has become an important character study in the form of a biography. Plus, you do not need to know much about Britain's past to see the film. It is a must watch for everyone.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8.7 out of 10"

","The Queen as seen here and imagined with enthusiasm by Morgan is not as witty as Alan Bennett's Queen, in her last on screen recreation, in A Question of Attribution (directed by John Schlesinger, 1992), nor does the estimable Ms. Mirren (who's nonetheless very fine) have the buoyancy of Prunella Scales in Schlesinger's film. But she is witheringly cold toward Tony Blair, all foolish smiles on his first official visit to the Palace. (Blair's played by Michael Sheen, who's experienced at this game.) As Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian, ""Mirren's Queen meets him with the unreadable smile of a chess grandmaster, facing a nervous tyro. She begins by reminding him that she has worked with 10 prime ministers, beginning with Winston Churchill, 'sitting where you are now'. As put-downs go, that's like pulling a lever and watching a chandelier fall on your opponent's head."" Fully recognizing the crucial importance of the British monarchy, this film is tartly reserved about both sides of the game. The royal family don't like ""call me Tony."" And Blair's wife Cherie is a bit ungainly in her blatantly anti-monarchy attitudes. But when Blair sees how Elizabeth's coldness and invisibility is angering the fans of Dady Di ‚Äì the media queen, the ""People's Princess"" -- alienating her own subjects en masse, he steps in and persuades them to leave Balmoral and look at the thousands of flowers for Di piled in front of the Palance with their humiliating notes; then deliver a ""tribute"" to Di on TV. The formal grandeur of the film inherent in its subject matter ‚Äì the Prime Minister and the royal family ‚Äì is offset by its ironies and by the intimacy of the tennis match that develops in communications back and forth by telephone."

","Helen Mirren delivers a fine Oscar-worthy performance portraying Queen Elizabeth II during the week Princess Diana was killed in that Paris highway accident. Michael Sheen matches her in his portrayal of the just elected Prime Minister Tony Blair. They both come off as human in both their likes and dislikes of certain aspects of each personality. Certainly the constant news footages of Diana's funeral and the actual papers that disparages the queen for her behavior during the whole ordeal give The Queen a close-as-accurate telling as one expects from a modern film recreation. Compelling throughout, The Queen is one for anyone interested in an excellent drama about the royal family."

"alainenglish","9","1","1","10 April 2007"," It shouldn't work, but it does
","Making a film about Princess Diana's death less then ten years after the event seemed to me a little bit crass, especially it features people who are not only still alive but very familiar to us: in particular the Queen herself, her family, not to mention Tony Blair. But by now the film has been covered in so much glory and plaudits, I thought I may as well see what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>I thought it worked well. Helen Mirren acquits herself very well as the Queen, giving a very human dimension to the monarch. The other main characters are brilliantly realised: Sylvia Syms' daft but still regal Queen Mother, James Cromwell as a pompous and old-fashioned Prince Phillip and Alex Jennings playing Prince Charles as a weaselly fop. Writer Peter Morgan has respectfully kept the two princes out of it, and asides from a brief bedroom scene where Charles breaks the sad news, they are not seen. The spectre of Diana lingers heavily over the movie, and as an audience we understand the Royal's conflicted attitude towards the Princess, fighting through their personal dislike of the woman to try and understand the public's admiration for her.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Mark Bazeley's representation of Alastair Campbell. Not only does he look almost exactly like the real man, but presents two sides to the character, both as a cynic scornful of the royals and a sleazy opportunist making the most of a terrible situation.<br/><br/>The real standout though is Micheal Sheen as Tony Blair. At first glance, the portrayal is only two steps away from yet another comic send-up, but Sheen takes the character on a journey here. He shows how the crisis allows Blair to become infatuated with the monarchy, sowing the seeds of self-delusion that will eventually prove the ruin of his premiership. Though this isn't the first time Sheen has played the role, I would like to see him do so again and develop his portrayal further.<br/><br/>Peter Morgan's script gets the balance right between comedy and drama, and turns out what proves to be an incisive historical satire on British politics and the monarchy.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"GMJames","9","1","1","7 April 2007"," Anchored by Helen Mirren, ""The Queen"" is a brilliant recreation of royalty under a public microscope
","I have no idea if what screenwriter Peter Morgan and director Stephen Frears presented in the fascinating, alternately dramatic and biting film ""The Queen"" is even close to what the Windsors are like in real life. More often than not, I view Queen Elizabeth II in press and video not knowing a thing about her. The movie could have easily been a skit making fun of the royal family, i.e.: Spitting Image, The Kids in the Hall, etc. But Morgan and Frears took the high road but not without some very darkly funny lines and observations set during the week when Princess Diana was killed in a car crash and the royal family's reaction the week after the news.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren's complex and believable portrayal of a Queen and a royal family in crisis was outstanding. What really impressed me is how underplayed the performance was. It certainly would have been out of character for Queen Elizabeth II to chew the scenery. Mirren's work, which justifiably received many acting awards, is a great current example of an under-the-surface performance. Just like the Queen herself, keep a stiff upper lip and don't allow your emotions to show in public. Somehow, Mirren made Queen Elizabeth II human which was not an easy task. Despite anyone's negative feelings for the film itself (excluding myself), Mirren's performance should be studied by acting fans for years.<br/><br/>I was also fascinated by the relationship dynamics throughout the movie. From the Queen's back-and-forth meetings with the young, new Prime Minister Tony Blair (well-played by Michael Sheen) to her husband Prince Philip (James Cromwell), her mother (Sylvia Syms) and even the relationship she has with the public.<br/><br/>At a running time of just under 1 hour and 40 minutes, ""The Queen"" ponders several questions: After the death of Diana, despite protocol issues, were the actions of the Windsors justified? Was the general public justified in criticizing the actions of the Windsors? As a world, do we expect too much from people in higher profiles? With the press and the internet, do we have the right to know the private life of a public figure? Frears, Morgan, Mirren and the rest of the production crew for ""The Queen"" did a masterful job of capturing one of the world's most private public figures."
"teh_mode","7","1","1","27 February 2007"," Elevated by two heavyweight performances
","It may be called The Queen but Stephen Frears' Oscar-buzzing film is every bit as much about Tony Blair as it is her majesty. Covering the week in September before and after Diana's death, the film focuses on two perspectives, one being the newly appointed Prime Minister, whose popularity soars after proclaiming Diana as ""the people's princess"", and that of the Royals, in particular the Queen's decision not to make a public statement about Diana, since she was no longer a member of their family. The Queen is about the battle between stoic traditionalism and modernity (with the two central figures representing the clash of both philosophies). And whilst the film itself is nothing truly remarkable, the weight gathered by the superb central performances of Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen elevate it beyond an ITV-style movie special. What is really baffling however, is that the Queen apparently enjoyed this allegedly anti-monarchist fable."

","As an avowed republican I was unsure, even knowing the many accolades the film has garnered, that I would have much interest in it. However my curiosity about Liz was too much for me and I looked forward to seeing the normal side of a public figure who I had grown up with. I didn't know much about her except the TV spots showing her with strange looking little purses hung on her arm and her undoubted love for Corgis. That the entire film was built around the week that Diana was killed in Paris took me a little by surprise but in terms of film building it made perfect sense.<br/><br/>In my opinion, everything that has been said about Helen Mirren's performance is absolutely true. She embodied Elizabeth perfectly and she richly deserves even if she doesn't receive an Accademy for her performance. Having said that, I can not recall a single performance that was in any way mediocre. I was struck with how extraordinarily accurate the performances were. The casting was remarkable; every person from he Duke to Blair's offsiders were perfect.<br/><br/>Regardless of your feelings about the Monarchy, remember Blaire's outburst at his staff towards the movie's end, this film should be seen: see it for its contemporary history, for the fabulous acting work, its brilliant casting as well as settings not normally seen."

","(watched in Toronto)<br/><br/>It is rather ironic that Queen Elizabeth II, who was immensely popular, loved, even worshiped when she was crowned as a young woman, was driven to the brink of disaster four and a half decades later by another young woman, who wasn't even alive. The deaths of Diana in August 1997 brought about a fascinating case study of crisis management, in the royal order, and provided material for a movie that will likely fetch Helen Mirren a Golden Globe or an Oscar, or, entirely in the realm of possibility, both.<br/><br/>The movie, elegantly shot by Stephen Frears (director of ""Mrs Henderson presents"", credential that he knows he way around things British) evolves around an engaging parrying between then newly elected (in landslide too) young Prime Minister Tony Blair and 70-year-old Queen Elizabeth II, surrounding the royal family's response (or rather the lack of which) to the death of ""people's princess"" Diana, who had already divorced Charles and was therefore not a member of the royal family. Diana's immense popularity, fuelled further by the manipulating media, brought about a minor crisis, to the extent of threatened proposals of abolishment of the monarchy on account of being insensitive to her tragic death. Disaster was finally averted when The Queen, recognizing the practical need, followed Blair's recommendations in honouring Diana in her death.<br/><br/>The Queen is portrayed in sympathetic light in this movie, which would be better understood by people who were around (even as kids) during her coronation. Coming to the throne in such overwhelming popularity and well loved during most of her reign, it was just totally beneath her to be part of the cheap, popularity games that seems to have taken over the way the world now operates. It is rather heartbreaking to hear her, still in cool dignity, intimate ""I have never been hated by so many people in my life"". And it takes a actress of utmost confidence and authority to bring out that regal quality and at the same time sensible humility. Helen Mirren is just the one, and probably the only one today.<br/><br/>By comparison, Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is dwarfed (probably the characters in real life too), but his is a good performance. So is everyone else in the supporting cast. Omnipresent James Cromwell is a wonderful Philip, particularly in revealing lines such as ""Bloody fool¬Ö..you're tea got cold"" after The Queen interrupted her tea to take a call from Blair which turned into a tense, substantial verbal duel. Once beautifully attractive Sylvia Syms is excellent as the Queen Mother, ""mummy"" to The Queen.<br/><br/>But there need be no other reason to watch this movie ¬ñ Helen Mirren IS The Queen"

I was really no more than a child for much of the time that Diana was capturing the imagination of the American people, so I didn't fully understand her allure, and I certainly didn't understand, or care much, about the politics of the royal family.<br/><br/>So watching ""The Queen,"" Stephen Frears' wonderfully fluid account of the few days following the death of Di and its impact on the royal family, I had the uneasy feeling one gets when he realizes that something of extreme cultural importance has happened right under his nose without his realizing it. I had much the same feeling during ""Hotel Rwanda.""

Certainly it's an awfully one-sided movie. In Frears' version of events, Tony Blair single-handedly saves the monarchy from the vitriol of the British people. It's only through his dogged determination that Elizabeth grudgingly lets go of her royal principles and gives the people what they need -- that is, a sign that the royal family is comprised of a group of people with actual blood in their veins and feelings in their hearts. Michael Sheen, an unfamiliar actor to me, plays Blair beautifully; his performance goes beyond mere mimicry and conveys both the exhilaration and overwhelming sense of responsibility felt by a man who happens to find himself in a job for which he happens to be perfectly suited at one of the most critical moments in his country's history.<br/><br/>But though everything is greatly slanted toward Blair, the film does a good job of cluing us in to Elizabeth's point of view as well. Here's a lady who inherited a job she did not choose, and who by the very nature of that job is turned into a media spectacle against her will. It's important to remember that during the moments when her and her family's callousness toward Diana and her death borders on the inhuman; in their minds, Diana played a large role in her own death, and payed a fair price for the stardom she received in return. In Elizabeth's mind, the way the British people behave smacks of hypocrisy; they cry out for blood for the media that caused Diana's death, yet want to hang the royal family for not putting themselves and their grief on display.<br/><br/>Navigating the tricky waters of this tricky part is one of our greatest living actresses, Helen Mirren. Because I like her so much, it gives me great pleasure to say that her performance lives up to its hype. She gives what is so rare in films these days -- a tour de force of expert acting. Just watch her face and gestures throughout this film for the tiny nuances that speak volumes. Mirren has been buzzed about as the front-runner for this year's Oscar race since this movie opened, and for once I find the buzz completely justified. The Academy has a chance to show the world that it can, against all appearances to the contrary, recognize true art and talent when it sees it, so of course they'll probably botch things and give the award instead to a glamour puss who will look better on the cover of ""People"" magazine. But Mirren I'm sure will be the winner in many people's hearts regardless.<br/><br/>Frears keeps things moving along with quick editing and a fantastic, staccato score whose effectiveness rests on its judicial use. There's something disorienting yet exciting about watching a movie about people who are alive and well, and still serving in the same roles as their fictional selves on screen. In some ways, ""The Queen"" feels like it should have come out last year, when a number of other relevant, terse and immensely engrossing films flooded the screens. Though if it had, it would have been one great film among many, whereas this year is has quickly risen to the cream of the crop. <br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Helen Mirren makes every effort to look as miserable as possible playing Mrs W, but sometimes you just feel she is about to burst out laughing, especially during a crucial scene! James Cromwell, as the Duke of Edinburgh, follows her Majesty around like some demented corgi while trying to say as little as possible, and quite rightly so, as every time American actors try to sound English they usually sound like American actors trying to sound English, and the least said about Michael Sheen the better! I've noticed some of our American cousins who have watched this movie have taken it to heart, and as usual believe everything they see on the screen. No commercial movie ever made has ever portrayed the absolute truth, telling the truth doesn't make money, and this film is no exception. Its about as far removed from reality as most other Hollywood money spinners.<br/><br/>I'm British born and bred, and I grew up following the lives of the royals as my parents found them amusing. The movie is quite funny and does entertain as long as your not stupid enough to place your faith in it! so have a few beers and enjoy it... but set your alarm clock just in case!"

Sure Helen Mirren looked the part of the Queen and I guess did a good job. I don't really know since you never here the Queen talk in public, at least in America you don't. No one knows what was said behind closed doors, so this can't be an actually detailed movie of all the facts. The queen is basically portrayed as being indifferent when Diana died and wanting it to be a private affair not public. She was portrayed as cold by the media and forced to support a public funeral to appease the Princess's fans. Her husband even says things like ""you hated Diana"" toward the queen. That's probably true.<br/><br/>But the point is this movie is just dull and certainly did not deserve to be nominated for best picture. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Not good. Sure the acting is descent, but the movie is pointless. Who cares how the royal family handled Diana's death."

","I have just seen this film for the first time, shown on British terrestrial television last week. It is quite one of the most ridiculous films I have ever endured. Firstly HM the Queen is awakened to be told of Diana's death. She is in bed with husband Phil the Greek. Do the writers of this expect us to believe they share a bed? No way, it is common knowledge that they have different bedrooms. When the Queen drives Phil and herself around the Balmoral Estate they do not fasten their seat belts. Are we expected to believe that after what happened to Di they would be so foolish? When Queenie starts to cry when she is alone on her estate she proceeds to wipe her nose with her large neck scarf. Are we really expected to believe that one does not have a hankie? In several scenes the telephones used in Balmoral are two tone green or grey that date from the sixties, yet in one scene HM uses a very modern phone that has a speaker-set and sits alongside one of the obsolescent phones. How did Sylvia Sims not receive an Oscar nomination? Her portrayal of the dotty Old Queen Mum was spot on. Mr Blair was almost portrayed as a buffoon. As I said before this really is a stupid film. Because of Sims and Helen Mirren I'll give it a score of 4, but really it is load of rubbish."

","All right, I admit it - I'm an American, and I was totally mystified by the frenzied grief surrounding Diana's death. What did she do for the British public except spend money? How much of a ""sacrifice"" is it to appear at hospitals and orphanages in finery paid for by the people, and then retreat to a privileged life of clubbing, incredible luxury, numerous extra-marital affairs, and what seems to be eternal ""holiday"", all at the expense of an incredibly highly taxed public? By now it is obvious that I am not a ""Diana-phile."" I thought she actually perpetrated an incredible scam on the British public (particulary in the exquisitely acted BBC interview in which she presented herself as heartbroken and lonely), and I was thrilled to see at least an inkling of this sentiment in ""The Queen."" I am no fan of royalty of any kind, but I thought the British (and in fact the world) public did a great disservice to Elizabeth II by refusing to acknowledge, as was said in the film, ""there is a public Diana and a private one, and there is no relationship between the two."" There are at least two sides to every story and this is really the first time we've been shown at least a glimpse of the family's side - that Diana was no saint, and that a large part of the family's reaction was dictated by the way they had been bred - to keep a stiff upper lip and not to air one's personal business in public."

I do not believe in the grandmother or queen heart of the queen family, no matter how many films they make. Showing the queen crying for Diana's death or the haunted animals death.

I find that the exaggerated (but not slapstick) portrayal of these very well known people serves to highlight the emphasis of the film as an analysis of public perception as led by the tabloid press as opposed to an analysis of the Royal Family's actions.<br/><br/>Accepting this view of the film opens your eyes to a depth of subtle humour and characterisation that might be missed if the viewer treats this as a straight drama with comic interludes."

","After hearing the rave reviews and hype surrounding this movie, I hired it from my local video store only to be hugely disappointed. This was a film that was meant to by about Queen Elizbeth, but ends out being a film all about the death of Princess Diana. The film is full of news clips and TV footage surrounding Diana's fatal crash, and the Queens reaction. Helen Mirrens rendition of the Queen is not bad, but definitely not worthy of the Oscar she received. The rest of the cast were simply dire. Made for TV drama's on the BBC and ITV have better acting than this. Prince Charles is made to look like a weak geeky mummy's boy with no credibility while Prince Philip fares no better, As for Tony Blair's character a TV comedian could have done a better job blind eyed. There's more to the real Queen than the death of Princess Diana. Its a shame we didn't get to see it.

","Winning numerous awards and hailed by critics, I was not as impressed with the film. It did give an interesting insight into the Monarchy, and the effect Diana's death had on the world - Britain especially. The Monarchy (in my opinion) serves a tourist purpose only and has long since lost the reigning power as it used to be. This film proves it. The 'etiquette' towards the Queen should long since have been abolished. She is a mere person and not a god, and it is frustrating to see how they revel in luxury and opulence at the expense of the general public.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen was mostly comical in the beginning of the film, removing every inch of drama and feeling she possibly tried to convey. Prince Charles was a very weak character, while Prince Philip was bombastic. The only strong character for me was Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Even Helen McCrory as his wife, Cherie, was for most of the film annoying.<br/><br/>The film did nothing for my senses and the real life footage was more interesting than the film itself."

The supporting actors were just as impressive, whilst Alex Jennings and Martin Sheen don't quite look like Prince Charles and Tony Blair, but they both give very subtle performances.

"dingoberserk","8","2","4","6 December 2008"," An amusing crash course in advanced parasitology
","What stands out in my mind after watching The Queen is its (unintended?) comicality. Behind a glitzy facade, we are confronted with the empty, squalid lives of people with 'more money than sense', as the saying goes, yet desperately attached, limpet-like, to their privileges and wealth. Mercifully deprived of all real power, the head of an institution well past its use-by date continues to behave as if the destinies of the nation depended on her decision-making skills. But the only issues she is allowed to determine are trivial and merely symbolic, as, for example, whether a flag should be flown at half-mast or not, in memory of a youngish, mediocre, promiscuous ex-daughter-in-law who had squandered most of her copious time consorting with wealthy and not-so-wealthy men instead of spending quality time with her teenage sons. The youngish PM, supposedly the leader of a socialist political party, keeps up the fiction, behaving sycophantically towards the 'head of state' and propping up a system which only benefits those who are already obscenely wealthy. All of this is shown against a background of inexplicable public grief, yet another example of the old dictum 'monarchs will behave like monarchs only as long as their subjects continue to behave like subjects'. Only five years down the track, there occurred an event which clearly demonstrated how values are completely reversed in our society: the unprovoked invasion of Iraq. On that occasion, a truly humane monarch could have refused to sign the order-in-council which authorized the invasion; but didn't. And millions of citizens could have filled the streets of London to protest; but didn't. To be sure, there were demonstrations against the intervention, but they were much, much smaller than those mourning the dead 'princess'. And so the show goes on, staged by the lackeys of the obscenely wealthy and applauded by the gullible millions. Just one more question: if Elizabeth Windsor is genuinely averse to stag hunting, why does she permit it on her own multi-thousand-acre estate? All in all, I regard this as an excellent movie, although it is not entirely clear to me whether its perceptive portrayal of royal squalor was intended."

"miloc","6","2","4","19 December 2007"," How real is the Queen?
","The IMDb trivia page tells us that screenwriter Peter Morgan spoke to many insiders to gather the ticklish details that inform this movie; is it fair to wonder if some of those sources may have had a vested interest in how certain principals are portrayed? Not to carp unnecessarily, but Tony Blair as portrayed in this film comes off a great deal closer to Hugh Grant in ""Love Actually"" than any real-life politician has a right to. He becomes little more than a mouthpiece for the screenwriter's better instincts. (Any hint of cynicism in the motives of 10 Downing Street is safely offloaded onto Alastair Campbell.) Yet Sheen (who was recently drafted by the same writer to play David Frost onstage) is quite good; he's eerily Blairish, and it's easy to imagine his startled, amused reactions as being those of the genuine Blair facing the real thing, the monarch, the Queen.<br/><br/>But how real is the Queen? We are told, by this film, that she is more real than we might imagine, despite having lived one of world's strangest possible lives, and the notion is undeniably charming. As presented by ""The Queen,"" the entity of Elizabeth II comprises an intriguing mixture of naivete and worldliness, cushioned detachment and sly, sometimes prickly wisdom. When she tells newcomer Blair that he is the eighth Prime Minister to sit before her, Winston Churchill being the first, we see a flash of tightly smiling panic on his face -- he's like a young man learning about his older mistress's past lovers. How does he measure up? The movie displays great deftness in catching these wonderful little nuances of the way society and royalty interact, and these touches are so entertaining that one almost regrets the overarching plot that demands the reconciliation of these two deeply odd entities -- it's the moments of disconnect that draw you in the most.<br/><br/>The cast is good all round, with particular kudos to James Cromwell, Roger Allam, and Sylvia Sims. But of course none of this would work without the towering presence of Helen Mirren, whose performance cannot be overpraised. With no showiness or visible self-indulgence she suggests an absolutely credible complexity in her assumption of authority: from the moment she appears she simply is the Queen of England. (Within a few minutes you may forget what the real one looks like.) She's marvelous, unaffected, and compulsively watchable, and she holds the whole movie on her shoulders without seeming to notice the burden. Morgan's screenplay is witty and filled with snarky gossip, but it ultimately adds up to no more than glib, and Frears' direction, while characteristically stylish, adds little in the way of profundity. All in all, we have a respectable little entertainment that happens to be anchored to a remarkable and mysterious presence, embodied by an equally remarkable and highly empathetic performer. ""The Queen"" is worth seeing for that alone."
"nycritic","10","2","4","14 June 2007"," The Lady Named X
","Towards the end of Stephen Frears' THE QUEEN there is a scene in which Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren, at her acting finest)gets a visit from Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen, a great foil for Mirren). Two months have transpired from the events following Princess Diana's tragic death. Blair inquires if it must have been hard for her (as they take a walk which will take them out into the gardens). The look that Mirren as the Queen gives Sheen as Blair is unique -- the stuff that elevates simple acting into something truly transcendent. It's the look that conveys pages upon pages of untold, unexpressed words, the gesture which says, ""You have no idea how it's been for me. Not just that awful week last year, but all my entire life."" <br/><br/>And true to fact, neither can we. Never in the history of reigning monarchs has there ever been a less popular, more thankless person. It's as if she had devolved from being little more than a decorative figure maintaining a dying tradition, into worse than a relic, or the painting she is posing for at the opening credits. Diana, the rival, roams throughout the movie, unseen but clearly the Rebecca everyone -- variations of Mrs. Danvers, all of us, the vox populi -- rooted for and loved and expected to see carrying the ultimate Title, whereas all Elizabeth II could aspire to be less than X, blotted out, a brittle old woman with bad fashion taste frozen in the Fifties, on standby as to how she should react to Diana's death -- and this is the crux of the action. One hellish week, a battle of popularity, and a moment of indecision as to what would be the right action to take in regards to mourning The People's Princess.<br/><br/>A stunning movie made by a consistently remarkable director, THE QUEEN is a subtle little game of wills while it takes a darkly perverse time in skewering the monarchy, particularly in scenes involving arguments between the Queen's husband, Prince Philip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) who dissect their reactions, none too pleasant, about the rituals of mourning -- you wonder if these people actually exist and the headache it must be living with them. The feat that THE QUEEN manages to pull off is that it makes the viewer commiserate with Queen Elizabeth in the end and the fulcrum happens to be that surreal scene where she gets stranded in her own grounds and comes upon the stag her husband has been trying to hunt down. That she is, through this stag, able to finally come to terms with the fact that the world has moved on and she is in her own island is the best scene in the entire picture."

Usually one for action movies and the occasional comedy, this wouldn't normally have been a pick for me, except that I was a Diana fan, and continue to follow the current Royal family as best I can from this side of the Pond.<br/><br/>The other qualifier is that I get obstinate when I hear how wonderful a movie is, that it's a masterpiece, that it's ""intelligent,"" that it's a shoo-in for loads of Oscars. Right away, I brace myself for something slow, something even boring, or just downright so ""intelligent,"" that it fails to connect with me in anyway. (So, okay, I am really a low-brow movie-goer but nonetheless thoroughly enjoyed Crouching Tiger.) <br/><br/>From my perspective then, I found The Queen ponderously slow and too understated. Absorbing, yes; even faintly riveting. Mirren as Her Maj, was amazing, yes, as was Michael Sheen (as Tony Blair). The writing (Peter Morgan), was excellent and delivered with elegance and perfect timing by a skilled and talented cast. BUT, in my opinion, there was not nearly enough tension between Royal family members themselves and the Spencer family, of whom we saw or heard very little, with the exception of bits of Earl Spencer's eulogy. There was rumored to have been some blowout arguments between Prince Charles and his mother and father, about whether he (Charles) should have gone at all to Paris to recover Diana's body. To those not ""into"" the British royal family, there is as much politics within the family as in the House of Commons. But there was very little of that. All these might have been included to show exactly how much was brought to bear on the subject of the film, The Queen.<br/><br/>About the Stag: yes, I thought it was a symbol for Diana at first. But why was the Queen crying in the first place? Was it because of the pressures of that week? Or was it because her Land Rover broke down in the middle of the river? Was she mourning the loss of Diana?! Another commentator thought the Stag was a symbol for the Queen and her way of life.<br/><br/>I am going to have to give this a 7, for a lack of intensity. While I agree that Mirren and Sheen give sterling performances, with top-notch direction and writing, there was/is much material that could have both enriched and given a gritty, rough-edged quality when life is interrupted by death."

","An exceptionally well written, directed, and acted film. I am torn about the best picture category, but would not be disappointed if this film won. I would, however, feel that the Academy would be making a tremendous mistake if they did not honor Helen Mirren with a statue, in spite of the other fine actresses in the category. Ms. Mirren put a face on the most recognized yet most isolated monarch in the world. Kudos! I am far from a royalist sympathizer, but I do appreciate the human element this or any story provides. I was equally moved by the symbology employed by way of ""stalking the stag."" Princes Philip, Charles, William, and Harry, while at Balmoral would go out daily to stalk a 14-point stag for a hunting expedition in order to distract the younger princes from the horror of their mother's untimely and brutal death. Queen Elizabeth encounters the stag in one of the films most beautiful and emotional moments. The Queen's Range Rover breaks down as she tries to ford a river. While waiting for help, the stag appears. Standing before the Queen, the noble animal represents the British Monarchy; its ability to survive despite attempts on its life parallels the longevity of the Crown. The stag's tenuous hold on life mirrors the Queen's trouble at maintaining the monarchy due to rising unpopularity. Her attempt to honor the Spencer family's right to private mourning is seen as inaction and a lack of compassion by her subjects who mourn en masse. When the Queen acquiesces to Prime Minister Blair's recommendations to return to London and acknowledge the mourners she learns of the stag's death. Significant is the fact that the stag was not killed by a ""royal"" but by a ""common"" investment banker from London. An act portending the fate of the monarchy at the hands of the British subjects if the Windsors fail to modernize. It is not so much that the British, as portrayed in the film, were shouting down with the Queen, but were looking to their Sovereign for consolation during their collective mourning. Mirren and the entire cast succeed at putting this small slice of British history into perspective, and for that this film succeeds."

","The Queen is very interesting in that it works as two entirely different movies depending on the audience. To a British citizen or an Anglophile, the movie works as a political docudrama taking an interested viewer further behind the scenes of a historic event that they're already intimately familiar with, much like ""All the President's Men"" or ""Good Night and Good Luck."" Watching ""The Queen"" is the current events equivalent to rewatching your favorite movie on DVD with a commentary track.<br/><br/>At the same time, to those like myself who aren't well-versed with the cultural and political complexities of the UK and who watched the clamor surrounding Princess Diana's death with passing disinterest, it was more of a period piece: an epic tale that makes for both a story composed of historical facts as well as a parable of lessons relatable to our current state of society.<br/><br/>The main challenge, therefore, is to make detached viewers like myself care enough about these characters, which it does increasingly so as the film progresses.<br/><br/>The film starts out as a portrait of an aging political figure facing a dying way of life that will diminish her power and perhaps deservedly so. Queen Elizabeth II, played by Helen Mirren, is confronted with the recent ascension to power of a new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who is seen as a possible threat to her prestige for championing modernization and various other liberal causes. Their relationship forms over a crisis over how the Royal Family should properly respond to the death of Princess Diana, who is a thorn in the Royal Family's side for disowning the royal way of life. Since she is loved by the masses, she serves as a fairly obvious representation of the dichotomy between tradition and modernity that is at the film's center.<br/><br/>The film's strength, however, is that it doesn't pigeonhole its two main characters as the personification of either of those two sides. Each is a more complex person trying to navigate their ways through the pressures that those sides and people on them present. At its heart, ""The Queen"" is about the common ground that must be met between two very different political figures, and the possible friendship they form out of it. The film preaches that with democracy in the hands of the masses, everyone at the top is just as likely to be misunderstood by their subjects and power is a delicate thing.<br/><br/>The film is currently in the running for a best picture Oscar nomination and while it succeeds at what it is trying to do and serves as an interesting study of politics and class conflict, it doesn't have the gravitas to it that I feel would merit it an academy award nomination, especially in a year as competitive as this one."

","This was an 'interesting' take on the happenings within the palace and the conflict between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth. I say interesting because it shows a side of the royal family that we have never seen(whether rightly depicted or not)and my friend and I chuckled throughout at the absurdities of the royal Family. They just didn't get it!Their world was and still is I suppose so far removed from the rest of the world that they sometimes appeared almost pathetically indifferent but in a childlike way.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren was absolutely wonderful and no one and I mean no one could have played Lizzy like her...she was Lizzy. She showed us an uptight serious woman who was damned if she was going to succumb to public pressure and in the end simply had no choice.Somehow I felt she blamed Blair for making her choose the right way ,after all , the other Royals, aside from Charles, thought she was perfectly right in her refusal to acknowledge Diana""s death. I thought Michael Sheen as Tony Blair(actually looked like him) was also good and he found himself actually liking(?) admiring(?) the Queen (maybe not her actions but the woman herself) and his wife Helen McCrory was a hoot.<br/><br/>""Royal protocol is an absolute silly bore"" as Blair's wife showed us amusingly. <br/><br/>Prince Phillip came across as a pompous ass and Charles,well he was a no show although he seemed at least part way conscious of public feeling.I also found it amusing that Margaret was shown as someone who just didn't count so she was better off holidaying...somewhere.And the Queen Mummy....I'm actually chuckling as I write this.<br/><br/>As I said it was in all a very interesting movie.

","Where conventional films lack in strong craftsmanship, great acting, story, character arc, crisis and climax, ""The Queen"" seems to effortlessly execute all within this tight biopic about the tragedy of Princess Diana's death and the demands made on the royal family by the people.<br/><br/>It was a perfect reflection of our society today, where people's connection to celebrity, or in this case royalty, is so strong, it can gravitate to the level of obsessiveness or even tragedy. This theme starts off this soaring masterpiece with the car accident that took Princess Di's life. Wasn't it the paparazzi photographers who was partly responsible for this untimely death? And isn't the demands of the inquiring minds of the public that only fuel the tabloids paying the paparazzi top dollar for such pictures? Then when a tragedy occurs such as this, it's the same public that grieves the most.<br/><br/>What disturbed me was the demands the people made on The Queen to join them in their mourning for the princess. The threats and criticism she received from the people, was it necessary? They spewed hateful rhetoric about The Queen's lack of remorse concerning the incident. The people's invested interest in Princess Diana's passing should never cloud rational thinking then be insisted upon the monarchy. But it was, which gives this story a grim look at us as a people.<br/><br/>The excellent performance by Michael Sheen as Prime Minister Tony Blair makes one reflect on the business of politics.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren was mesmerizing as The Queen, which should solidify her for a 2006 Best Leading Actress Oscar.<br/><br/>The screenplay was near perfection, with witty dialogue, fleshed out characters and unforgettable character arcs.<br/><br/>So far, this is the first film I am giving a ten to this year, making it my Best Picture of 2006."

","It didn't take long after meeting my wife to find she was an admirer of Princess Diana. Considering Diana's good looks, fashion sense, humanitarian work and popularity it was easy to understand her worldwide appeal.<br/><br/>With that in mind, on a weekend morning in August 1997, I crawled out of bed, turned on the ""telly"" to hear breaking news of a major car accident involving Lady Di in Paris. Knowing my wife would never forgive me for not waking her up, - I did. For the remainder of that morning and early afternoon we sat glued to our television trying to gain whatever information became available.<br/><br/>This film is an intimate look at how the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II, had difficulty juggling her personal sentiments, royal tradition, and the feelings of her British subjects as the death of Lady Diana stuns all of England and the world.<br/><br/>I'm no expert on British royalty, however Helen Mirren* blew me away as the Queen. Her presence, her stiff upper lip, quiet grace, and overall royal behavior were pleasing to watch. She was able to manage this difficult role yet show a Queen who is not perfect, but was able to realize that fact and adjust to the needs of her people.<br/><br/>Mirren's performance is already generating lots of Oscar talk about a nod for Best Actress in a Leading role. After watching this film, I would have to agree."

","A new prime minister who feels sympathy for his monarch's fustiness, and saves her from the consequences of her reserve; a royal family happy to be rid of an unseemly daughter-in-law; a prince hoping that his mother will realise the cost of withheld affection; a speech-writer angling to give his boss leverage over the guardians of conservatism and privilege. A queen who feels more sympathetic regard for a hunted stag than for her hunted former daughter-in-law, and is shocked to her core by the discovery that her subjects' love has turned to suspicion and scorn. ""The Queen"" imagines the interplay of feeling among the residents of Buckingham Palace, Balmoral Castle, and 10 Downing Street, during that late summer week in 1997 when a car crash in Paris punctuated the grim second act of the royal story that began as a fairytale engagement and marriage in 1981. We see a literal application of correct funerary protocol driving a huge, and unexpected, wedge between the English royal family and its subjects. We see a Prime Minister, flushed by the success of his new vision for Britain, and bolstered by his iconoclastic wife, regarding his Queen at first as a relic of the past he's received a mandate to revitalize, then working to save her from the consequences of her seeming coldness, and finally coming to admire her powers of discernment and endurance. We see the loneliness within a family taught for generations to perform the role of calm, dispassionate leadership by example, but never allowed (and never allowing itself) to reveal true inner feeling. One thing made clear to me by the film: Diana's gift of apparent naturalness and emotional honesty, which endeared her to millions of people, were perceived as unworthy of her station, by many others. The public response to her death was regarded by many upper-class Britons as confirmation of the public's emotional instability and a predictably tacky empathy for her own excess of sentimentalism. These feelings were manifest in the royal family's behaviour at the time. What they did not realise was the depth of loving admiration which Diana had kindled in peoples' hearts during her marriage, and the depth of sorrowful loss which her death created. So their adherence to strict protocol - the death of a former family member was to be grieved privately and without show - caused their subjects to judge them as cold and cruel. The Prime Minister knew that the moment was altogether more significant, and pivotal. He counselled an acknowledgement of the immense public grief, and his counsel saved the queen's stature. It's altogether admirable that the excellence of the film's performances, especially those of Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen, take us back inside this time, not so long ago, in which a young woman's death transfixed the western world, and an ancient and respected institution was, for a time, distrusted and almost despised by the very public on whom it depended for its authority."

But after this movie I realized something, Queen Elizabeth is also a human being.<br/><br/>This movie is set mainly in the aftermath of Princess Di's death and how the royal family and England handled the tragedy. The thing I didn't realize was that loosing Princess Diana was like England's 9/11 and how tragic it was. Everyone of course wanted the queen to quickly respond and help those who were also mourning in England. But the thing people don't realize is how she is giving herself to her country first and herself second.<br/><br/>I loved how they showed a different perspective and helped most of the audience realize that the Royal Family are people too. They deal with grief in their own ways and had a lot to inhale those few weeks. Merrin was absolutely stunning in her role as the queen, she was so dignified and elegant, I'm sure she'll be up for a nomination during the Oscars.

"davideo-2","9","2","4","1 November 2006"," A well conceived and well made film with brilliant performances all round
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>1997. A year that saw the face of England change forever. A new Labour government was sworn into power, promising radical new ideas and reforms after many years of oppressive tory rule and, during the summer, a terrible tragedy struck when Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in a Paris tunnel after being hounded mercilessly by paparazzi. But what was life like for the Royal Family during this tumultuous period? With the public in a united state of grief over the terrible tragedy and needing to take it out on someone in the shape of the Royals, who appeared cold and indifferent to Diana's passing, this film follows the royals as they struggle to cope with mounting pressure from their public to do away with ancient royal traditions and customs to show respect to a woman who was loved by so many.<br/><br/>With it being just under ten years now since Diana's death, and with a lot of the focus still being on the woman herself and how she was hard done over by all those who were meant to care the most about her, it's certainly a very interesting idea to show it from the perspective of the royals themselves (life did go on for them after all) and how the unfolding events came to affect them and the tidal wave of hysteria they were caught up in. It's good as well that it's been pulled off so well. <br/><br/>The film slips in a few interesting facts about the queen (that you might not have known) along the way whilst telling a story detailing the reasons she was turned against by the public along with the rest of her family during that unforgettable summer when the nation united in grief. A good story is unlikely to be pulled along without strong performances to back it up and that is the case here. In the lead role, the renowned Helen Mirren is sturdy and dynamic as the commanding monarch, and she is of course guided along smoothly by a strong supporting cast, including Michael Sheen as the new prime minister, (the American) James Cromwell as the uptight and pompous Prince Philip, Sylvia Sims as the neglected Queen Mother and Alex Jennings as the beleaguered, mourning Prince Charles. They are difficult roles to pull off (and not ones you can entirely keep a straight face to) but under the circumstances they all do splendidly.<br/><br/>Quite simply, this is a very commendable and inspiring film telling events from an angle they weren't seen from that is well worth seeing. ****"
"qempyrean","9","2","4","8 October 2006"," Extraordinary Mirren *IS* Queen Elizabeth II
","While watching this pitch-perfect character piece unfold on the screen, not for one moment did I think to myself, that's Helen Mirren up there playing the Queen. Mirren has long been of my favorite actresses, and her performance is riveting... so far removed from Prime Suspect's terse and gritty Jane Tennison that it's hard to believe you're seeing the same person. Michael Sheen's Tony Blair starts out seeming a little like Eric Idle playing the Monty Python version of a Prime Minister, but he quickly grows into the role, and as the relationship with his monarch uncomfortably develops, his eventual explosion at his staff's callousness is unexpected and passionate. Among the other members of the royal family, Prince Charles comes off the best, though not without a suggestion of self-interest as his motivation for wanting to do the right thing by the late Diana. Least sympathetic are the perpetually annoyed-by-it-all Prince Philip, convinced hunting will deflect his grandsons' grief (an amusing turn by PETA member James Cromwell); and more surprisingly, Sylvia Syms' oblivious Queen Mother; both apparently devoid of any emotion or real concern that their country sees Diana's death as a personal tragedy. Mirren portrays Elizabeth II as so independent, self-confident, and non-imperious, you wonder why she puts up with them, but of course that's the crux of the drama: she sees it as her duty to maintain a facade of family harmony, something in which Diana failed; and it's the heart of her dilemma: how does she give her subjects the comfort which all her upbringing and respect for tradition tells her is inappropriate?"
"aharmas","10","2","4","7 October 2006"," As Good As It Gets
","Helen Mirren is a superb actress. For nearly one hour and forty five minutes she becomes Queen Elizabeth II, giving us a glimpse of what it must have been for that remarkable woman during a very stressful week of her life. Director Stephen Frears demonstrates what assured directing can produce. The film flows easily from beginning to end, carefully weaving a narrative where everyone gets a chance to present his / her view.<br/><br/>Mirren perfectly portrays the conflicted monarch who must balance her set and conventional views with what it is needed from her during a critical time in the history of her country. Suddenly she risks becoming archaic and portrayed as a unfeeling monster, a characterization that interacting with her famous daughter in law she managed to develop in the eyes of her country.<br/><br/>With the astute intervention of her newly elected Prime Minister, things might take a turn for the better. The end result is not surprising because it is by now public knowledge, what is fascinating is the trip there, an emotional ride with enough class to appeal to the old guard and intense dramatic components to make even the most cynical member of the audience react and get all sentimental.<br/><br/>The film has exquisite production values, with gorgeous camera-work and a magnificent musical score that fits its theme very well. It is a pleasure to know Frears has come up with another royal winner."

","Queen Elisabeth II is one of the longest reigning monarchs in Europe. Monarchy is considered an outdated and outlived draconian thing of the past by some. This movie portraits a very difficult and extraordinary period in the reign of Queen Elisabeth II. The monarchy in Great Brittain was under great stress when Lady Diana, former Royal Highness since her divorce from the Prince of Wales, died in a car crash in August 1997. There was no protocol foreseen for a death of a former Royal Highness. The reaction from Buckingham palace throughout the event leading op to Diana's funeral are documented in this movie. The Queen, played by an excellent Helen Mirren, needs to rethink her position as ruling monarch. Newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair plays a very handy role in preserving the monarchy from further harm. It is one of the first times that a real live ruling monarch, and certainly a sturdy, strict monarch like the English Queen is portrayed like a human being. The Queen is a strong woman, a strict and correct mother, who finds it difficult to deal with emotions, since she was never thought to show them at all. I found this movie very insightful and witty at times. Robert Allam (Robin) played an excellent assistant to the Queen. The story deals with issues about old traditions, held up high by Englands Monarch who is confronted by an ever changing world."

","I was curious as to what to expect from this movie - I'm not a particular monarchist and have no time for TV 'docu-dramas' etc - but this movie is a real tour de force and I was utterly captivated. Mirren's performance, in particular, is remarkable - understated and yet seething with emotion: anger, loneliness, confusion and regret. I also liked how there were multiple narratives in the film - Cherie Blair is the firebrand Republican, Prince Philip the callous old timer, Prince Charles sensitive yet paranoid, Blair's adviser cynical and self-serving - all have their view of the unfolding drama and this allows the viewer to take from the film what they like. Even Diana herself has a recurrent presence in the film - with archive footage showing glances, tears and comment adding tension to the main plot. There are also significant moments where much is left unsaid and it's for one's own imagination to fill in the gaps. Finally, the film is extremely comical in many instances - the Blairs first meeting with the Queen quite hilarious!"

As expected the Leicester lad served up a refreshing in delicate piece looking voyeuristically into the depths of the royal household during public mourning of Diana, Princess of Wales.<br/><br/>Viewers should be aware that this is no mainstream run of the mill production and is peppered with strong emotion and dashes of awkward humour.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren masterfully portrays the struggling monarch with believable emotion and effortlessly shows the audience the difficulties of accepting change and the breaking of tradition. Underneath the marvellous scenery and accurate characters is a modern fable about press intrusion and the demand for change in contemporary Britain. As the obnoxious and single minded Alistair Campbell lusts over the headlines it is refreshing to see the Royals agonising of the real issues such as their private and familial grief for the loss of Diana.<br/><br/>At the very core of its message The Queen asks us to question to what extent one must pander to the role of the media and public opinion. Would we want our Queen to lust for headlines or grin like the pretentious Cheshire cat of Downing Street? This is certainly not a film which everyone will find entertaining. But if you are seeking a disturbingly accurate exploration of modern media and the role of the establishment then the Queen is certainly a must see."

(PG-13)<br/><br/>Following the death of Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren) chooses to remain private, passive and dignified while the country struggles to mourn and deal with their grief; recently-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair (Sheen), however, encourages her to abandon the stoicism and address her people. Surprisingly intimate portrait provides a glimpse into the private lives of the monarchy, dominated by two very effective performances (Mirren earned universal hosannas--and an Oscar--for her splendidly nuanced work, yet mannered but magnificent Sheen is nearly her equal). Benefits from Peter Morgan's insightful and gently humorous script, though some of the supporting characterizations are shaky (notably Cromwell's grouchy Prince Philip), and because the film so often focuses on the isolated, publicly aloof world of the royals, it lacks strong dramatic interest or the context of perception--even with the occasional person-on-the-street news clip, what stirred the passions of the people remains elusive to anyone who didn't live through it in Britain. Frears is always better served with venom soaked into the strings he pulls, so it can't be considered surprising (or even disappointing) that the quietly intriguing film he delivers leans closer to ""respectable"" than ""spellbinding.""

There were calls for the Queen to say or do something, but there wasn't' until public opinion proved otherwise.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren gives an excellent portrayal as ""Her Majesty"" and the turbulent time she endured during that controversial moment. She had the Queen put down pat and even perfectly imitated the waddling way she walked.

Brought me back to when Diana died and how I was feeling. Explained why the Queen seemed so distant during this time that rocked the world. This movie was NOT about Diana, but was a viewpoint from another side. I have always respected Tony Blair, but this took it farther. A must see...."
"Mrbrown43","7","0","0","30 March 2018"," The Queen: A Royal conundrum
","Can you remember the weeks after the death of Princess Diana? For those who don't remember or were not there at the time, the Princess of Wales Diana Spencer died on 31st of August 1997 and the whole world went into morning. The British people in particular were very upset with her death with seemingly millions joining together in their grief, an unprecedented move that was never before seen or since. This is the backdrop for The Queen.<br/><br/>The Queen begins with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) being elected Prime Minster and goes through the next few weeks until the public funeral on September the 5th. The main focus is on the royal family trying to comprehend the death and struggling to understand the reaction that occurred. The film does itself a favour by focusing on the Royal family and inability to understand the change of behavior on the British people. I like fact the movie does not vilify or deify the family, it treats them like humans. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth 2nd is so very believable as the queen, you do not even see her as Helen Mirren, for all intents and purposes is the Queen. She is a woman who does not understand what to do asides from what is to be expected of her and the film does not judge her on it, if anything it sympathies with her. Michael Sheen is uncanny as Tony Blair, his smile, his accent it is all so believable. Same goes with James Cromwell as Prince Philip I can't see anyone else portraying Prince Philip or anyone else doing it as well as James Cromwell. <br/><br/>The film is flawless on a technical standpoint; I cannot see any flaws in terms of filmmaking. Overall a very well made movie. I think one of the best moments of editing in the moving is how the movie inter cuts old recordings of Diana with the first person perspective of the driver and the occasionally cut to the reporters chasing the car.<br/><br/>The film is mostly accurate to the historical events, with some minor chances to simplify the events for narrative purposes. It does paint the press in a somewhat negative light and does gloss over the entire backlash against the journalists that resulted in Diana's death. It just has a missed opportunity that could have been explored if it had a longer running time. But it does not really hurt the movie overall. <br/><br/>The Queen is a pretty good movie all things considered. I really cannot find much to talk about. So yeah..."

","Cunningly put together: real footage spliced with suppositional fictional dialogue and events. Mirren and Cromwell are exceedingly well cast, and convincing, if slightly one-dimensional. It's the way the parts are conceived and written. But Charles, Blair, Cherie, Alistair and Queen Mum, unfortunately come across as little more than cartoon caricatures. This is the problem with the movie as a whole: it seems rather shallow and superficial, as if its subject were really Diana, and not the Queen.<br/><br/>Stephen Frears is nevertheless a subtle, multi-layered director. His early production, ""The Hit"", is a masterful example. This film, like that one, is certainly memorable, and has a trick of making you reflect and think about the implications of the events taking place. There would appear to be a distinct advantage of having a hereditary figurehead, in effect a President, with no political power, who is brought up and trained to behave in a responsible, representative manner. This is not a position suitably occupied by a ditzy celebrity type of bimbo, going all out to court popular publicity. The alternative to the tradition evolved in the UK over the last thousand years is currently transpiring across the pond. An amusing and telling remark was made, to the effect that Blair's charisma might possibly also one day evaporate."
"kijii","9","0","0","26 November 2016"," Helen Mirren's Oscar-winning role
","This movie gives us a look at what things might have been like at the time when Lady Di was killed in a car accident in Paris. Helen Mirren gives an excellent portrayal of Queen Elizabeth. She is so convincing as the queen that one soon is able to easily suspend any disbelief that she is NOT the queen. Helen Mirren--whom I have enjoyed since her Shakespeare work in the late 60s early 70s---won a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar for this role.<br/><br/>Another 'dead on' performance is that of Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. The movie starts with the moment when Blair first had his first awkward audience with the queen. It then skips forward to the time when Diana was killed. <br/><br/>As the royal family vacations in Scotland, Blair's problem is how to convince the queen that she must return to London to acknowledge the grief of the people and finally have a large public funeral rather than a small private one. This is a case of the royal family not knowing HOW to react under such unusual circumstances. Blair, plus public sentiment, helps her to realize what should be done."

","I really enjoyed the movie, and usually I'm not a big fan of this kind of movies, given the poor action scenes and the small unroll of the actions. Despite this fact, I believe the movie is great: it represents two very distinct parts of England (the royalty and more conservative way, and the recent and progressive way of dealing with a fainting one), it allow us to see some beautiful landscapes of England (and apparently Scotland); the pressure of the media, as being one of the most powerful tool to both influence the queen's behavior and to transmit current events; Tony Blair dealing with his commitments to the people and dealing with the royalty. That being said, some less positive things about the movie are important of referencing: After reading some comments and reflecting on the movie, I must agree with some comments regarding the fact that the movie does look like a way of justifying the queen's behavior. I don't remember the tragic event of 1997 (I was 4 years old at the time), but after watching this movie I can perfectly accept the queen's behavior. Another thing I didn't understand about the movie was the deer scene. I didn't understand what it was meant to be, and the fact she tries to protect the deer in one scene, but then she congratulated the deer's hunter, which was confusing to me. In conclusion, I think it's a movie worth of seeing."

","This is pretty good, a perceptive and sensitive telling of the Queen's and the public's response to the sudden death of the more or less declass√É¬© erstwhile and glamorous Princess Diana.<br/><br/>The public goes ape in their mourning. There are terraces of bouquets on the pavement around Buckingham palace. TV is full of Diana -- people weeping, wondering why Queen Elizabeth up there in Scotland, in Balmoral Castle, doesn't come down to London for the funeral, wondering why the flag isn't lowered to half mast.<br/><br/>On her part, Helen Mirren as Elizabeth doesn't know what all the fuss is about. After all, Diana is no longer a royal, more of an ex royal, who betrayed the family and spoiled the image of the monarchy. And the flag can't be lowered because it isn't shown in the absence of the Queen, so it's not even raised. Hubby Prince Philip, James Cromwell, a surname to conjure with in the history of British royalty, is openly angry about the whole affair. His chief concern is stalking this big stag that has been roaming the countryside but always keeping just out of rifle range.<br/><br/>Alex Jennings is Prince Charles, former husband of Diana, and plays the role as wishy washy and compliant. Other than anguish, it's difficult to know what he's thinking or feeling. Michael Sheen is Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, whose cojones are caught in a vice between the Queen and the public whom he represents. Sheen actually LOOKS like Blair.<br/><br/>The story is magnificently played and keenly written. Elizabeth, we learn, drives around the grassy, windswept Scottish glens by herself in a Range Rover. The vehicle stops dead after crossing a stream and the independent monarch determines that it needs to be towed and repaired. (She was a mechanic during the war.) So -- picture this -- the Queen is sitting alone at streamside, waiting grumpily for rescue. She looks up and there, on the other side of the brook is the stately stag, a vision of serenity, indifference, and majesty, a royal unto itself. She stares at it for a minute, then shoos it away before the rescue team arrives.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the stag, it is bagged by a neighboring family. The Queen politely insists on visiting the estate and there hangs the carcass and on a table the noble head with its ornate antlers. The animal had been wounded and tracked for miles before being killed. Elizabeth caresses the furry cheek and mummers something about hoping it didn't suffer too much.<br/><br/>Boys and girls, my teacher in the sixth grade, one Miss Velma Spurge, taught us that this was called ""symbolism."" I'd expected something less from this production, an overdramatic, overwrought, overdone, spelling out of every scintillating tabloid detail. <br/><br/>But no. It's an adult tale. There are clips of Diana doing what Diana did, speaking openly to reporters about how she was resented by the royal family, speaking out about the many personnel mines left from the many forgotten wars in Africa and elsewhere that are now blowing the legs of children. She was the personification of the three virtues of Greek philosophy; she was honest, she was good, and she was well favored. It's no wonder the public were in love with her. Of course, to Elizabeth, her unsparing candor was irritating and she was an impulsive brat.<br/><br/>The Queen gives in to public demand and finally comes to London, perhaps wiser than when she left."

","The Queen (2006): Dir: Stephen Frears / Cast: Helen Mirren, Michael Sheen, James Cromwell, Alex Jennings, Helen McCrory: Powerful film about positions of high authority and their limitations. It focuses on the events surrounding the death of Princess Diana and the anger directed towards the royal family. It also gives insight into the involvement of British Prime Minister Tony Blair who maintains contact with Queen Elizabeth. Director Stephen Frears has made such triumphs as High Fidelity and Dirty Pretty Things. Here is another example of his great talent using actual news footage as well as give insight behind the Queen's reaction. Helen Mirren gives a flawless performance as Elizabeth seen as ambitious yet somewhat trapped in her position. Her best scene arrives when a young girl at the front gate presents her with flowers when she thought they were for Diana. Michael Sheen plays Tony Blair who deals with media issues surrounding Diana's death as well as stir Elizabeth towards a public funeral. James Cromwell appears as Prince Phillip while Alex Jennings appears as a worried Prince Charles. Helen McCrory plays Tony Blair's wife, Cherie. Regardless of one's thoughts on the situation surrounding Diana or the Queen, this film certainly acts as a testimony of sorts from her end. Beautifully crafted film that allows viewers to glimpse Queen Elizabeth as a human being. Score: 10 / 10"

","Had I not been given a DVD copy of this movie by a thoughtful friend, there's no way I'd have ever chosen to see it, and that would certainly have been my loss! While the script contains several 'suppositions' concerning aspects of the private lives of some very public dignitaries, this astounding production draws the viewer into a web of highly thought provoking situations.<br/><br/>Were the royals right in their disgust of Diana's very 'out there' lifestyles? Was it Diana herself who was at fault or was it the relentless madness of a public fueled thirst for superficial publicity - ruthlessly dished up by a totally out of control, mostly soulless media. Seems they were/are all at fault within a shocking display of pride and moral selfishness. Given there are plenty of facts available and I don't usually approve of presumptive fiction, the screenplay by writer Peter Morgan is both intelligent and sensitive. It cleverly avoids judgmental dispersions that often accompany the writings of over zealous defenders of one side or the other, for this it has to be praised.<br/><br/>This work also, unintentionally or otherwise, invites the viewer to consider the shift in ethical and personal character, that can be observed within the attitudes and behavior of generations who experienced the self sacrificing agony of war/as against those who matured during the post war boom and the emerging generations that followed. Growing up within a youthful population, these generations were heading for rebellion (some, regardless of validity or necessity)<br/><br/>If looking back at the sensibilities that stimulated our developing psyche during these years, to a large degree, it consisted of a barrage of newly developed superficial type entertainments made for that 'new glow' in the lounge rooms of the modern home, TV. ~ A world wide proliferation of sensationalistic publications and art distributed by unscrupulous profiteers ~ We are now bombarded daily with relative mindlessness from an endless array of glossy magazines combined with all forms of sensation seeking news media (so many good people who dedicated their lives to helping others come and go with hardly a mention, yet a modern 'story book' princess brings nations to their knees) ~ There's no end of sus video 'games' and a plethora of so-called 'social' sites to also aid the promotion of a hedonistic ""it's all about me"" attitude ~ Added to this volatile mix is a world of super slick, psychologically driven advertising that is constantly telling us we need products and services, we in fact, don't really need at all. <br/><br/>The politically astute who have done a little research, will also be aware of other examples of this form of Social Engineering even within 'mainstream' cultural manipulations...these being derived from economically motivated 'agreements', set-up between various international government agencies, to elevate the value of essentially mediocre works to ridiculous heights. What emerges is an interesting study of who we have become, culturally and morally. For all the improvements we have brought to modern civilisation, much of it exists alongside an unforgivably suicidal dumbing down of our larger society. <br/><br/>Director Stephen Frears maintains control all the way, keeping the story moving by avoiding any unnecessary padding that can all too often be associated with lesser productions of this type. With the story being set in places that would not be made available, the work of the production designer, art director and set decorators, becomes crucial to imparting the essential look of believability necessary for full audience involvement. <br/><br/>Director of Photography, the award winning Brazillian Cinematographer Affonso Beato takes us on a not to be missed visual treat. Sumptuous indoor visions accompany outdoor aerials of grand proportions, truly eye popping! One special scene involving a magnificent 14 point Deer appearing in the same frame as a crying Queen Elizabeth is outstanding. This sequence also begs the viewer to consider several deeper meanings affecting all involved. <br/><br/>Golden Globe wining music sound track composer, Alexandre Desplat adds generously to the unique emotional journey on offer in this splendid achievement. This should please all discerning viewers who enjoy first class movie making. The high quality 'Studio' DVD transfer I screened is first class. The cast of course, are uniformly superb. <br/><br/>KenR"

","After watching Helen Mirren's magnificent performance in the Queen, I think Dame Helen should become the queen herself, of course figuratively speaking. Her portrayal as Queen Elizabeth II in the midst of tragedy was incredible and very realistic as if she was actually the Queen. The film itself is a fantastic movie and it can be a little emotionally overpowering at times. It's a character-driven drama that tests the true strengths and weaknesses of character.<br/><br/>Stephen Frear's film takes place during the immediate aftermath of Princess Diana's fatal car accident. The royal family keep to themselves and don't even offer public recognition, much to the outrage of the people. Newly elected Tony Blair is the link between the monarchy and the people and it's up to him to face all the pressures and satisfy both sides.<br/><br/>Enough cannot be said about Helen Mirren's performance with gave her a deserving Oscar win. Her realism is through the roof and no one can play the Queen better than she can. Michael Sheen makes for an excellent Blair who uses all his resources to get the recognition Diana deserved. James Cromwell delivers a fine performance as Prince Philip, who is adamant about staying hidden.<br/><br/>Overall, The Queen is an excellent film led by the magnificent Helen Mirren, who perfectly captured the essence of the Queen. The film also shows how Diana was about the people, despite her extravagant lifestyle. The people loved her dearly, and it's quite incredulous how the royal family did not see that. But after all was said, I still deeply admire the Queen. A great film about one of the darkest times for the royal family. I rate this film 9/10."

It would have been an atrocity if she did not. All is well with the world. That said, words cannot even begin to describe the level of an emotional roller coaster this film was. Mirren just swallows up every scene she's in that you just might find yourself doing a double-take to make sure that there wasn't a hidden camera placed in the British house of royals for us to spy on them Big Brother style. The film deals with a very dark period of the lives of the British royals...the death of princess Diana. It begins with rushes of her past life up until she begins dating Dodi Al Fayed, follows Prime Minister Tony Blair's election to office, streams through the last few hours of the princess's life, the royals reaction to her death, the public's reaction to the royals and how Tony Blair helps save them from themselves."

","I feel that kudos should go to the producers and directors for even attempting to depict both such a high profile event and the royal family. It risked being too crass, too superficial, too weighty, inauthentic, or even (gasp) a parody. But it was pretty good overall. Including real-life footage from the era was another huge risk that paid off. I didn't see the end of the movie on TV because I guess I wasn't that personally interested in the story (and I know how it ends) but overall, the acting was great, particularly Helen Mirren as the Queen and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair -- the latter role, in particular could have veered into parody if he hadn't got the slightly effeminate voice right, but it didn't. It was one of the biggest challenges facing the royals in ages and it was intriguing seeing how they handled it from the inside, in the modern world, as opposed to how we normally see period pieces involving Henry VIII, George III et cetera."

","When the former Duchess of York died in a foreign country due to a drunk-driving accident, the British royal family took only a passing interest. After all, Diana Spencer had divorced out of their ranks and used the celebrity they provided to turn herself into one of the globe?s biggest star often at their expense. Their subjects, who all but worshipped the tall, lean, blond, erupted into anger over ?The Royals? indifference and Queen Elizabeth II found herself facing the true possibility of the end of the monarchy. Director Stephen Frears does a masterful job of balancing the competing motivations of The Queen and her family, politician Tony Blair and a stunned and furious global public. The tension between the most traditional of institutions and its need to change or potentially perish makes this a fascinating story. The cast is so good that Michael Sheen who does a very good job as Tony Blair actually stands out because he doesn?t quite capture the full political slickness that the actual Blair exudes. Just a handful of nits keep this from being a truly transcendent movie. There are a few odd shots including a ?Grand Canyon? helicopter trip over Balmoral which feels like filler. Princes William and Harry are never shown as characters despite several scenes where they are just off camera or just behind a half-open door. Also, there is a very unlikely sequence where Her Majesty goes four-wheelin? and has to call someone to pick her up after she blows an axle (really?).

The Queen's protocol reaction and the public's kneejerk perception of the Royal Family makes for an interesting well-acted and directed couple of hours.<br/><br/>Movie opens with the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as Prime Minister of England, and the death of Diana (artfully done in swift shots interspersed with real footage). Blair is made to look like a strong, acute leader; the only head of state who discerned which way the populist wind was blowing. (Of course, this was before he became Bush's bumboy in 2002, when he failed miserably on predicting the gunmetal winds).<br/><br/>Time and again, Blair would try to advise Elizabeth to make a public statement of grief over Diana's death. But the Royal ""we,"" supported by imperious husband Prince Philip (James Cromwell) instead turned to protocol, insisting Diana was no longer a member of the royals (which was correct) and so deserved no public display of royal commiseration.<br/><br/>Even as the Queen's British approval ratings plummet, she continues to insist she knows the tenor of ""her people."" Yet how could she, being holed up since her twenties in that gilded cage? Director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan walk a delicate tightrope with the Queen's character; though she comes off as snooty in dismissing Blair, she retains a fragile humanity, which I credit to Mirren's performance. I'd stake my life that the actual Queen - after so many insular decades behind those lascivious, hedonistic palace walls - has no clue what humanity IS anymore.<br/><br/>As much of the action takes place within the palace, I'm intrigued as to how many details of the Queen's bedchambers and private quarters they got right. Every time a movie is made on an Oval Office set, the filmmakers crow about the intricate detail they put into it (because Americans are allowed to take tours through the President's domicile and office), but who's going to know if the halls of Buckingham Palace are authentic, except the few hundred people who work within them (and they're not talking for fear of being beheaded)? <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Mirren is suitably regal and British, yet when she goes on national TV for the Diana statement, suddenly we hear her adopt that super-posh ""Queen voice"" - up to this point, she needed to do nothing else to secure the Academy Award she would win (2007, Best Actress, Leading Role), but as soon as she dropped that Queen voice on us - it was all over.

","Queens are not just characters is period romances. Or fantasy stories. ""The Queen"" is a fascinating look at a monarch of not only historical fact, but also of a modern world. Played with grace and poise by the great Helen Mirren, Queen Elizabeth II becomes a specimen for our the moviegoer's microscope rather than remaining that elusive royal figure locked up in Buckingham Palace.<br/><br/>In many ways, this is what the film is about: a woman grounded in one of the deepest traditions there is in terms of the British monarchy, who realizes that she too must change, must make herself known again to her people and become a more meaningful part of their lives.<br/><br/>The film begins with Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) being elected to office, but focuses on the week that shook the world when Princess Diana died tragically in a car accident in France. Diana was on poor terms with the former Princess of Wales, but her death struck a chord with her entire country and the world. The people and press demanded something from The Queen, who wanted to keep it quiet. It was a PR strategy that nearly threatened the monarchy's existence.<br/><br/>The crux of Mirren's performance is not her ability to create an incredibly royal aura about herself, which she does with ease. Rather, it's her ability to externalize The Queen's internal struggle of coming to terms with the need to change without being emotional or even slightly melodramatic. She must deal with this PR nightmare as well as the emotional trauma Di's death has caused her grandchildren while staying composed as a queen of 50 years would. She simply nails it. Despite staying collected, no one can come close to classifying Mirren's performance as stoic.<br/><br/>Peter Morgan (""The Last King of Scotland"") has chosen a perfect one-week period in his subject's life to forge this biopic. Diana's death is a moment everyone in the audience old enough to remember it will never forget. Even if we know nothing about Queen Elizabeth II, there's our perfect window into her life and the state of affairs of Britain. His script makes up what it lacks in external up-and-down conflict with conflict based on the stubbornness and internal battles of his characters. It's not only The Queen who must change, but Prince Philip (James Cromwell), Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) and the Queen Mother. The conflict is a raw tension between the sweeping tidal wave of current events/the press and the Royal Family's indecision and resistance. Mediating is Sheen as a youthful and idealistic Tony Blair.<br/><br/>""The Queen"" is a thought-provoking film about great change and how our best leaders are the ones that learn to embrace it, that ride ahead of its waves, no matter how uncomfortable it might be.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","In terms of performance, I believe that almost all the actors in this film did a magnificent job at giving cinematic life to their characters. Of course, having won the Oscar for best performance, Helen Mirren achieved a level of incomprehensible connection with a woman that seems almost untouchable. The most enjoyable moments I had while watching the film were her interactions with animals, not humans, because there appears to be a different kind of appreciation and delight that she gains from them. One performance that is not particularly noticed in reviews of the film is that of James Cromwell, an American actor who portrays the Duke of Edinbrugh in the film. He adds to the film a sense of hard British upper class high-mindedness and simultaneously there is a comical feel to his presence that eases the film away from being too solemn.<br/><br/>As a whole, the film is very well done, but it is easier to appreciate if the viewer had some sense of what had happened and the history behind the situation. Otherwise it would not have the same impact on those who are watching it. This gives us a chance to see why the Queen may or may not have made particular decisions, rather than simply remembering that she was not as outgoing with the situation as many would have preferred. I would recommend this film to just about any person, though as I said, it would be better appreciated by those who have some knowledge about the monarchy."

","""Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown"" - Henry IV, Part II All hail the Queen! Oops, I meant Helen Mirren, who won a much deserved Oscar for Best Actress at the Academy Awards this year! Helen Mirren's brave and confident portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in THE QUEEN is remarkable. Consider the fact that the monarch is alive and well and Mirren grew up under her reign in the UK. Besides the physical traits the Queen and Mirren share (such as a slightly down turned mouth), her portrayal of the Queen is imbued with a real humanity, quite beyond a simple ""stiff upper lip"". Our story is set in the year 1997, in London, during a very tumultuous week for England and its royal family. Tony Blair is elected Prime Minister and seeks to modernize the old institutions of the UK. He is overwhelmingly voted into office, and following tradition the Queen appoints him Prime Minister. This is a terribly formal event, involving some rather quaint formalities. Following the usual addresses and bows, the Queen is still obligated to ask him to be Prime Minister - he is not just assumed to have taken on that role just yet. On the heels of Blair's appointment comes the sudden death of Princess Diana in a high speed car chase in Paris. The public reaction worldwide is far greater than the Queen anticipates, and she takes Diana's two children, Prince William, 15, and his brother Harry, 12, away from all the publicity to protect them and help them deal with the tragic loss of their mother. They go to a country estate far from the city. With an old fashioned sensibility, the Queen wants a private funeral for Diana, and the solace of the English mountains. But as the public spectacle grows for Diana, along with the pile of flowers in front of the Buckingham Palace gate, the absence of the Queen is widely viewed as cold indifference. A rift forms between the people and the crown, fueling talk of abolishing the monarchy. Tony Blair respectfully pleads her to come and appear, but to no avail. In the meantime he acts as a mediator on the Queen's behalf; soon it is apparent however that she must concede. 'The Queen' grants us a glimpse behind-the-scenes at an enigmatic figure grasping awkwardly at the fact that times had changed, and that she had to change with them, or be the ruler of an unnecessary establishment. In the shadow of Princess Diana's passing we see the Queen's stoic vulnerability, her burdens, expectations, and conflicts faced in the public eye and behind closed doors. There is an inherent dignity which guides the Queen in her daily decision making. Director Stephen Frears' most recent film 'Mrs. Henderson Presents' starred Judi Dench and was outstanding. Frears does quite well with 'The Queen', earning an Oscar nomination for Best Director, along with a Best Picture nod. When you watch the film you cannot help but think - how do they have any idea of what happened in private? Through extensive interviews with many unnamed sources writer Peter Morgan is able to give us a peek into the intimate events the film focuses on. The sense of realism continues with the choice to use actual footage from that week outside of Buckingham Palace, in Diana's funeral, and the interviews with the public. Helen Mirren impressively paints a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II without wasting effort on perfect mimicry. This film is moving, surprising and completely fascinating."

","What can I add that the majority of the other reviewers on this board have not said. Mirren WAS the queen....exactly. What a great movie. Entertaining, exciting and moving. A great tribute to humanitarian Diana and a rare glimpse into the stately Queen. What a picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The actors all were superb, but kudos, especially to Mirren and to the actor playing Tony Blair. I did not really get a true characterization of the pomposity of Charles; the actor who portrayed him, I feel, was miscast. All in all, however, this is a must see piece of entertainment. You will really understand the Queen of England, and perhaps, if she saw this, and I bet she did, she understands herself a bit better."

","At an early point in THE QUEEN, Prince Charles comments that the Princess Diana known to the royal family and the Princess Diana known to the people are two entirely different entities. It is an astute observation, and much the same might be said of Queen Elizabeth II herself, a woman who has spent most of her life upholding the dignities, responsibilities, and duties of the crown regardless of her personal sentiments--and who has worked remarkably hard to keep those sentiments out of the public eye.<br/><br/>THE QUEEN focuses on the week following Princess Diana's fatal car crash, and Princess Diana's presence broods over the film in the form of actual news footage. But THE QUEEN focuses on Elizabeth, and as presented here she is a woman whose life has been dominated by the discipline required of her office. She has authority, wealth, and privilege of such degree that it is far, far beyond the scope of all but handful to imagine, much less understand. At the same time, however, she is a prisoner in a gilded cage; few moments are hers alone, and only her iron-clad will upholds her in the face of the demands of her office.<br/><br/>It not therefore surprising that upon Diana's death Elizabeth instantly sets aside her own emotions and moves forward inside the code of conduct that has dominated her entire life. Even her concerns for her grandsons must take second place to the demands of her office, and in this instance she determines that the office demands the same stability she has always offered to her people: a calm and unruffled visage and adherence to the meticulous protocol that has shaped her entire life. This proves a great miscalculation. The public, enamored of Diana, interprets this as indicative of royal indifference.<br/><br/>Very little can be said of Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II which has not already been said. It is brilliant and quite possibly unequaled in its recreation and interpretation of such a well-known and still-living figure. It is perfectly balanced by Michael Sheen in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose habitual informality offers a perfect counter-balance, and the remarkable efforts of those cast as the royals: James Cromwell, Sylvia Syms, Alex Jennings, and Helen McCrory, who play Prince Philip, The Queen Mother, Prince Charles, and Cherie Blair respectively. The tone of the film is cool, graceful, elegant, and indeed stately--and although this might have emerged as dull in other hands, it builds to a remarkable climax in the hands of Stephen Frears.<br/><br/>The one occasionally questionable note is the script by Peter Morgan. In one sense, it is remarkably resourceful, managing to include considerable detail; in another, however, it is extremely obvious. I was occasionally troubled by the thought that, had it not been fueled by the miraculous performances of the cast, it would have drifted into triteness. This is particularly the case in terms of character shifts, which occasionally seem unexpected and which occasionally go nowhere in particular.<br/><br/>It would be interesting to know what the royals and the Blairs think of the film. At present there has been--in typical Buckingham Palace style--little or no comment. The Queen herself has only noted that, given that it focuses upon a particularly painful time, she has no desire to see it. In terms of quality, the DVD is quite good without being dazzling. Bonuses include a short and generally interesting, if not particularly deep, ""making of"" documentary and two audio commentaries: one by director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan, which is good, and one by royal expert Robert Lacey, which is better still. Strongly recommended.<br/><br/>GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

","This outstanding docudrama is far better than it has any right to be, and neatly tip toes around the many bear traps that were waiting for those involved in this film. Hehen Mirren has been awash with praise for her performance- and rightly so. She plays it straight, and incredibly by so doing, elicits a level of sympathy from the viewer that was noticeably absent at the time in real life.<br/><br/>Cleverly, the supporting real life figures are played as caricatures by their actors. This enables some wickedly astute dialogue. Prince Philip is portrayed as the archetypal grumpy old man, Alastair Campbell as a venomous, self seeking, moral free gutter rat,and Prince Charles as a hand wringing, but sensitive soul. Cherie Blair will not be keeping her part saved on DVD ! Perversely the documentary footage adds credibility to the film , but eases off the power of the acted parts. Furthermore the scene where the Queen cries for the slain Stag is a bit too crassly symbolic for my tastes.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the end result is a triumph for all concerned and sends the message that contemporary drama can work after the recent flop of ""Bobby"" about Bobby Kennedy."

","When I first heard that Helen Mirren was playing the role of Queen Elizabeth, I shuttered. Mirren has had a very sleazy career and certainly her abominable life style is far beneath that of the Queen, who I have admired since she was a child. However, despite my reservations about Mirren, she did a superb job of playing the Queen and looked remarkably like her. Her performance was really a highlight of 2006 and the performance was hands down the best of the year The movie only briefly touches on Queen Elizabeth's illustrious reign and that is the period immediately following Princess Diana's death. The story has been so exhaustively reported on and in our recent movie, that the story is very familiar. For many there are no surprises. In reality, the movie is really just a docu-drama.<br/><br/>The movie clearly depicts the disrespect that the Royal family had for Princess Diana. She was in fact a tramp, and a glory seeker. Unfortunately, too many in the public didn't understand what was going on and they idolized her for all the wrong reasons. That is not to say that her ex-husband was any better but clearly both failed as royals in their relationship. However, her conduct was such that she did not deserve any respect as a royal.<br/><br/>For many, the movie gives a somewhat inside view of the life of the royals. It makes a hero out of Prime Minister Tony Blair who handled the situation in a most judicious manner. Unfortunately, because of his pushing England into the Iraq War, which has made him extremely unpopular in England, his moment in the sun will probably be forgotten although this film will certainly keep it in the spotlight.<br/><br/>The movie is so well done, that even though I am giving it only nine stars, it will remain a classic. The writing is just as superb as Mirren's performance and it wrings just about as much out of the story as could be done. The subtleties are magnificent and it is a movie is one I will watch again and again. My only reason for not giving it a ten was that some of the supporting acting wasn't as strong as the film deserved."
"Christopher_Reid","7","0","0","21 May 2007"," Quite enjoyable and generally well made but flawed.
","The Queen is a generally well made film with some very good performances (Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen in particular) and it is mostly very engaging the whole way through. It captures the tragedy of Princess Diana's sudden death very well and gives us an alternate point of view. There are some funny moments and some touching moments but ultimately I don't think it's much more than just a nice film.<br/><br/>To be completely honest, I think The Queen's biggest weakness is the music. I found it often detracted from the movie's impact rather than enhancing what was on the screen. The music itself was not necessarily bad per se but it just seemed clich√©d and unnecessary in the times it was used. If I remember correctly, music was used fairly sparingly however (adding to the semi-documentary feel) so it was not that major a problem. Nevertheless, I think The Queen exemplifies the power music has in films. In this case, I think it nearly ruins some potentially great scenes (the scene with the Stag for example).<br/><br/>Anyway, The Queen is certainly a good movie overall (Helen Mirren is excellent), well worth watching but not one that I'd be disappointed to never see again. I wouldn't have anything against seeing it again though."
"David_Frames","7","0","0","19 May 2007"," Letting daylight in upon magic
","The Queen is an unusual proposition because the events it dramatises pose similar concerns for the filmmakers to those experienced by the characters. The emphasis is on striking the right note ¬ñ the challenge for Helen Mirren, reflecting the conundrum faced by the real monarch back yonder, is presenting the monarch in the best light possible. In a mirror of September 1997, the trick here was to avoid some potentially disastrous hurdles and struggle for the right balance.<br/><br/>As a viewer I have difficulties of my own watching the Queen. The constitutional monarchy is as gross anachronism in a modern state that has pretensions of being a meritocracy and for that matter a fully fledged democracy. It embodies some fairly grotesque principles, not least hereditary privilege and deference to an institution that personifies inequality, ironically held in the highest regard by the strata of society that is least well off. If you could design a system from scratch it's hard to imagine a model that would seem more ridiculous. Those who defend the idea and indeed the Royal family itself usually do so because so embedded is the class system in Britain, bleeding as it does into the every vein and capillary of British life, that something in their breeding tells them they're inferior and lack the mythic aura to hold the highest office in the land. It'd be like letting a chimp fly an aircraft. This inverted snobbery hits at the collective immaturity that allows the British people to subordinate themselves and preserve elites. Anything that threatens their existence is therefore desirable. <br/><br/>On the other hand, public reaction to the death of Diana was one of the most hysterical and outright bizarre outpourings of public grief in modern times. An inexplicable gush of sentimentality that gripped the nation as though someone had put ecstasy into the water supply. Papers, furious of the Queen's typically measured and withdrawn response, spoke of her subjects 'suffering'. Martin Lewis fought back tears on the BBC news. Millions left flowers and cried their eyes out in public. Nothing had been seen like it before or since. Anything approaching normal behaviour had obviously forgotten to wear its seat belt too.<br/><br/>So unusually, I watched the Queen both sympathetic to the confusion and outright indignation she presumably felt, at having to cow to this ludicrous collective nervous breakdown and the publics legitimate right to demand her compliance and example in a time of so called national crisis. Stephen Frears' film respects both arguments.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren, taking on the unenviable job of making the Queen a three dimensional human being, successfully presents Elizabeth as both dutiful and understandably perturbed by the public mood. <br/><br/>Whether you believe in the monarchy or not, it's hard not to feel a pang of sympathy for Liz as she attempts to reconcile her own values with those of her equally insane subjects. The flip side of course is that the public comes off less well, epitomised in no small part by Cherie Blair and Alistair Campbell, representing the kind of cynicism that gives apologists for the status quo the Oxygen for their reactionary arguments. They decry the fact she's out of touch, a funny sort of criticism when it's that very fact that's kept the Monarchy going throughout the 20th century. The public's hypocrisy was berating the Royals for acting like the rest of us ¬ñ divorcing, having affairs, etc¬Ö, what Bagehot famously referred to as letting daylight onto magic, and then lambasting them for not acting in step with Joe Public when the occasion demanded it.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen, reprising his role as Tony Blair, following the TV drama 'The Deal', is equal to Mirren in inhabiting his character completely, transcending mere impersonation. Frears pokes gentle fun at the New Labour figurehead, the scenes in his self-named Newcastle football shirt designed to show a little bit of the self-gratification that marked his early years in office. The closing scenes with Mirren, in which she warns him that the public are a fickle bunch whose affection can disappear faster than a princess in a Paris tunnel, hint at the hubris and the inevitable fall from grace. The script succeeds best however is showing the clash of Blair's new politics with the old establishment. The film mischievously toys with those in reverence to both worlds with James' Cromwell's Prince Phillip aghast at the homosexuals attending Diana's funeral highlighting aristocratic opposition to changing social attitudes, while Blair's lack of substance is hinted at when he gets a ringing endorsement from Tracy Ullman, phoning in her gushing tribute from Los Angeles in a CNN interview.<br/><br/>Ultimately the film is a bit of a valentine to its subject matter. So what if The Queen mourns a stag more than the mother of her grandchildren ¬ñ Blair sums the argument up a nutshell when he launches a tirade at a flippant Alistair Campbell. Diana lacked the selflessness and devotion to the institution that the Queen, perhaps alone, had upheld. ""She (Diana) threw what she (The Queen) offered back in her face and then flaunted it in front of the media, undermining everything she stands for"" is Blair's and the filmmakers assessment of the martyred princess. It's hard to disagree and harder yet to understand what an odd people we are for caring about it all in the first place. Sometimes it seems that cut off from the rest of society really is the sanest place to be.<br/><br/>Incidentally, in an interesting bit of life imitating art symmetry, Mirren ¬ñ a republican by all accounts, withered like Blair, another moderniser, when accepting her Oscar. ""Ladies and gentleman, the Queen!"" she proudly announced, like she was proposing a toast to an invisible set of dinner party guests. It was wince inducing and grotesque but good shorthand for the establishment reverence that guarantees the monarch's continued existence. Will we ever learn? The events of 1997 suggest we'd have to grow up first."

","Some events seem retrospectively less significant than they did at the time: the death of Princess Diana is one of these. So in a sense, there's little real purpose to Stephen Frears' film 'The Queen'. But it is great fun to see a collection of the great and the good, royals and politicians alike, portrayed exactly as we might imagine them to be. For example, a youthful Tony Blair features, exactly as he was before office and war wore him down; and likewise, everyone else is depicted in a way that seems utterly convincing, but never surprising. Watching this is almost like viewing a soap opera, where the pleasure comes from watching everyone perform to type. Helen Mirren is particularly good in the title role, and it's a tribute to her acting skills that she seems completely in character, and makes the role wholly different from her previous portrayal of Elizabeth the first. Overall, it's hardly a groundbreaking work; but Frears has made a career of depicting odd slices of England, and he seems to enjoy looking over the highest strata in the land with his offbeat eye. If you know anything about the events depicted, you'll probably enjoy it as well."

I guess mostly because of my preconception on the character of the Queen after reading books by Sue Townsend, especially her interesting portrayal in 'The Queen and I' and more recently 'Queen Camilia'. The Queen is a lot more fun, witty, strong, and at times, even highly intelligent in the book. I like the emotional and vulnerable side, and the steadfast stubbornness shown by the Queen in the film, well I guess you have to attribute it to Dame Helen Mirren's performance. But the part of Tony Blair, my goodness, this is just too much a compliment to make him the 'hero' of the day.<br/><br/>Yet, 'The Queen' remains as one of my favourite movies this year.

","One of the pivotal events of the 1990's was the tragic death of Diana, the Princess of Wales. This movie zooms in on the Royal Family in the aftermath. Wanting to keep the funeral private since Diana was no longer a member of the Royal Family, the Queen finds herself in conflict with her new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who correctly sensed the mood of the people early. He pressed the Queen to return from Balmoral and show her support. In times of national crisis, the Royal Family does not hesitate to lead the nation. In this case, however, the Queen was at odds with her prime minister, who also had to fend off his own advisers, some of whom wanted to use the opportunity to embarrass the monarch.<br/><br/>Dame Helen Mirren plays the Queen. This highly accomplished actress came to public attention in the British television series Prime Suspect, where she played the hard-nosed inspector - Jane Tennyson. Taking on the role of a living monarch is a daunting prospect which presents great risk. Queen Elizabeth II is known to the public only on ceremonial occasions and photo opportunities. She is loved by some and ridiculed by others but generally respected. Dame Helen has risen to the occasion and seems to have mastered the public persona and mannerisms of the monarch to an astounding degree.<br/><br/>The treatment of the Royal Family is not sympathetic. The family is isolated from the real world and has no sense of Diana's impact on the public. Tucked away in the castle in Balmoral, Scotland, the Queen is not about to bend to the will of the neophyte but politically-shrewd prime minister. Whether true or not, the royals were more taken with the appearance of a massive stag on the grounds of Balmoral. As we know, the Queen eventually came around. She sensed the harm that the press coverage was doing to the monarchy and felt she had no choice.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is the key to the story and the success of the monarchy of Elizabeth. She has learned to keep the monarchy relevant by changing with the times, albeit reluctantly. An icon of the 20th century, still going strong in the 21st, Elizabeth is the only British monarch that most of us have ever known. Giving her a human face is Helen Mirren's great achievement."

","Suffice to say, this was a magnificent portrayal of a potentially inflammable situation drama. The 'wet behind the ears' Prime Minister - beautifully brought to life by Michael Sheen with an edge of Rory Bremner, counteracted Her Majesty as the fool with King Lear. Helen Mirren, who will be forever associated with this role, duly complied with all that could be expected and played the weaknesses and strengths of an impotent monarch to perfection.<br/><br/>Helen McCrory, so often miscast (Anna Karenina? I don't think so.), was very good as Cherie, right down to that awkward walk, and that silly head-toss. James Cromwell (last seen by me in LA Confidential) did a fantastic job - Prince Philip is a daft combination of sense and nonsense, loyalty and betrayal - and Cromwell got this down to a 'T'. Sylvia Syms got to play a significant role which she managed very well, considering. I love Sylvia Syms, have always loved her, since Ice Cold In Alex, but she is, like me, overblown in middle age. But she got across the humanity combined with dignity that our beloved Queen Mother always had - and a caustic sense of humour to boot.<br/><br/>Restraint is not the keynote of films these days, but this film excelled in this most under-rated of virtues. My only criticism? The melodramatic intrusion of the 'Monarch of the Glen' and the Queen's emotional reaction. Appropriate to Balmoral, yes; to the plot of this film, no. But ... we can forgive Stephen Frears for taking a little licence here - one can't dispute it was a crucial moment in the film where Frears turned the audience's sympathy from Diana to the Queen.<br/><br/>This film could have quite an influence on the way the British Public's loyalty transfers back towards our monarchy, and away from Diana.<br/><br/>This is a film highlight which everyone (in Europe and America anyway) should see.<br/><br/>Jackie Scott-Mandeville, St Conan's Tower, Scotland"

","""The Queen"" is at its heart a very conventional film. From time to time I felt like it had some kind of TV-movie-feeling. That's due to the structure of the film. The characters develop, the scenes between are sprinkled with nice jokes and much of the dialogue comes across pretty unnatural. But, of course, the dialogue in the scenes that I refer to has to be unnatural, because it actually is in real life. But it all strengthens the feeling I mentioned. What is absolutely not TV-like is the acting of Helen Mirren. The strongest sequences of the movie for me were mainly those where ""the Queen"" was on screen alone, may it be her face in full scale, may it be her looking at the sea of flowers in front of the Palace, or may it be her trips out in the nature. And there is this absolutely stunning Diana-car-sequence, where sound, editing and images form something definitely memorable. Definitely not TV-like."

","The Queen has some fascinating performances (and Helen Mirren's most sympathetic character in decades), but there's a LOT of missing information that's necessary to making anything of the movie's main idea, that Tony Blair ""saved the monarchy"" during the Diana 'crisis.'<br/><br/>As mentioned elsewehere the story, set in the early days of the Blair (Michael Sheen) prime-ministership, is about how after Princess Diana is killed by the papparazzi the royal family, together with the government, must determine how to respond in the face of mounting public pressure for some form of national obsequies.<br/><br/>I don't follow celebrities. As far as I could tell, Diana was a pretty blonde who passed through life in the pocket of one or other millionaire playboy. The movie certainly says nothing to dispute that, which leaves me sympathizing more with a family that resents her for dumping their anxiety-ridden son than with the extraordinary obsession the British public seems to have had with her. The royals themselves are presented as peevish and old-fashioned, but so what? The film, however, drops a number of hints that Diana had an awkward marriage with an unfaithful Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) and that the royals supposedly disliked her from the get-go, all of which demands a LOT more explication within the film.<br/><br/>This brings us to the ""save the monarchy"" pitch. To be honest, I don't understand what that even means. At one point, Cherie Blair (Helen McCrory) suggests that it costs the British government 40 million pounds a year to support the Windsors, but it's my understanding that not only are the royals multi-billionaires in their own right but that the supposed ""subsidy"" is actually a portion of the income the British government receives from managing royal property under an 18th century contract. It's like young marrieds Tony and Cherie, living in the in-law suite of the parental home, making part of their income from managing the parental retirement account, then suggesting cutting the parents loose! This would make Tony B's odd outbursts more comprehensible, but as far as the film goes, we just don't really know the reason. The movie, after first suggesting that Blair ""saved"" Queen Bess II out of a kind of protect-mom projection, later drops a loud hint that Tony's take on ""the people's princess"" was of big benefit to himself. What's lacking, once again, is info within the film's structure that supports any of this.<br/><br/>That should be integral to the sub-theme of the direction of the Blair administration. The film talks a lot about Blair's election as a ""revolution"" with goals of ""modernizing"" Britain, but here again I'm totally confused. I thought that Britain, formerly a failing industrial-socialist state, was ""modernized"" by She Who Must Not Be Named back in the '80s. My impression of Blair was a polo-shirt progressive pulling a Clinton to get elected; rolling over his out-of-touch civil-service conservative opponent with a platform of platitudes that thinly disguised his actual economic beliefs, which seem to be just a kind of casual-day capitalism. Seriously, help me out here. Am I way off, or is the film trying to fake up some kind of story that Blair was romanced out of 'real' progressivism by a fascination with The Queen?<br/><br/>Well, I'd still recommend watching this, 'cause in addition to Mirren, James Cromwell, Sheen, and Sylvia Syms are terrifically entertaining and the scenery is gorgeous - including Mirren's expanding and contracting legs. I wonder if they weren't considering showing 'em with hair in the barbecue scene? And the scene of the Queen Mum (Syms) learning that her funeral plan would be used for Diana is priceless! For plotting and character development thumbs down, but for the excellent acting, two pinkies discreetly up."

","Apropriately dry character study, which details Queen Elizabeth's recent popularity crisis in the wake of Princess Diana's untimely death, may not be the engaging drama of sublime proportions many Americans had hoped for, but still maintains a level of political and social intrigue that rivals anything personally substantial England has imported in recent memory. Using the disastrous Al-Fayed/Diana auto-crash and subsequent royal reaction as a springboard, the reliable Stephen Frears shows the glaring disconnect found amongst a detached and privileged elite against the outrage of a mourning public with compelling results.<br/><br/>Although more subtle, witty, and lightly conceived then I was hoping for, The Queen nevertheless remains a captivating and illuminating piece of contemporary English history for the screen, all held together of course by Helen Mirren's masterful performance, and also a powerfully ambiguous and provocatively perceptive (though underwhelming in it's praise) screenplay. It is in these acute moments, which try to envision the tense reality behind closed doors of a notoriously unemotional family, that the unique charm and relevance of a movie such as The Queen begins to take hold. Whatever historical events the film likes to point out, such as the focus of The Queen's involvement with new prime minister Tony Bliar in combating this controversy, comes second to Mirren's quieter moments of old-fashioned introspection.<br/><br/>At it's heart, The Queen remains a politically engaging and mildly amusing character study, echoing the hunger for a more inviting social climate through the doomed analysis of England's first family. The movie may play a few cards in favor of a royal idealism that betrayed the social climate of the time, but the gently fascinating combination of old-world values meeting new-world situations remains as captivating a political British movie as any to arrive on shelves in America for years."

","This much-talked about docudrama faithfully recreates the frustrating moments at Buckingham Palace following the death of Diana in a car crash in Paris.<br/><br/>Award-winning Helen Mirren gives an astounding performance as Queen Elizabeth 11 as she assumes the voice and gestures in minutest detail of the reigning monarch.<br/><br/>Wishing at first to brush the whole affair aside as a purely private matter, and urged continually to do so by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh ( James Cromwell ), she finally gives in to the advice of Prime Minister Tony Blair that a public funeral service be arranged to meet the demands of the public. One could feel the torment that the Queen was experiencing as she often sat alone wondering what she should do next. Her advisers said she should broadcast to the people and it was even strongly suggested that a flag on Buckingham Palace should fly at half mast.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen as Tony Blair caught the right feeling as the young and ambitious Prime Minister desperately trying to persuade the Queen to change her mind, to make her realize that times were changing and that she must listen to the cry of the populace. To adhere to the old traditional ways was a perilous attitude and could well end the monarchy.<br/><br/>The Duke of Edinburgh gave little support maintaining an aloof and cold attitude throughout. The film makers made him such an unfeeling fellow. As for the Queen Mother (Sylvia Sims) she was portrayed as a rather dowdy creature lacking the true elegance and dignity which she has shown throughout her life.<br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in the film was the moment when Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) entered the room of the French Hospital to view the body of Diana. The atmosphere was suddenly quiet, the cameras remaining at a respectful distance and Charles himself quietly visible beyond the glass partition. Very well done, I thought.<br/><br/>I think it must be very difficult to play the role of a living person. One could be in for a lot of criticism. All will agree that Helen Mirren's performance could not be bettered by any living actress. While the film itself might not be everyone's choice for a Saturday night celebration, watching this performance of a truly great actress is a rare opportunity indeed."

"LadyLiberty","6","0","0","28 January 2007"," The Queen
","The Queen focuses on a few months in the reign of Great Britain's Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren). Those few months begin with the landslide election of the young and dynamic Labour Party candidate Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) to the office of Prime Minister.<br/><br/>At home, the lives of the two principals of British rule couldn't be more different. Blair, whose wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) is a strong critic of the monarchy in general and the royal family in particular, breakfasts with three boisterous children and urges his staff to call him ""Tony."" The Queen has her day rigidly scheduled and is treated with distance and deference even by those closest to her. Unfortunately, the two are soon brought together in ways they couldn't have imagined to deal with a situation neither could have anticipated: the untimely death by accident of Diana, the former Princess of Wales.<br/><br/>Blair is wakened in the middle of the night by a telephone call giving him the news. The Queen, who is vacationing at Balmoral, has her sleep interrupted by her personal secretary, Robin (Roger Allam). Bizarrely, both watch the news unfold on television. With another call, they each receive the news that Diana has died of her injuries, and now must determine his or her next step. That's where differences between the two become a chasm Blair in particular fears cannot be breached.<br/><br/>Blair speaks immediately to the people, referring to Diana for the first time as ""the People's Princess."" The Queen, on the other hand, repeatedly points out that Diana is no longer known as HRH (Her Royal Highness), and her death is thus a private matter (to his credit, Prince Charles seems to realize that more is required from them than the family is offering long before the elder generation grasps the fact).<br/><br/>The growing resentment for the apparent lack of grief on their part combined with the need to express grief of their own escalated matters with the people to the point where even the Queen was forced to pay attention. What few but Tony Blair could understand at the time was that the Queen wasn't unfeeling, but was instead utterly lost in the midst of an unprecedented event for which there was no protocol she could reference and the nuances of which she genuinely didn't understand.<br/><br/>In the end, of course, Diana was given what the vast majority of people around the world felt was her due. She was laid to rest with every bit of pomp and circumstance royalty might expect, and she was mourned by all from those in government to those with great celebrity to ordinary men on the street who wept with their wives and their children when the casket passed them by.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren is deserving of the accolades she's received in this role. Though not overtly emotional ¬ó that's what the Queen has been criticized for, after all! ¬ó it's clear in the film at least that she's far from unfeeling. She's merely been trained to rise above her emotions and to present a calm and stoic face to her subjects no matter the provocation. That Mirren makes us actually see that without being told is an indication of just how very good she is. Michael Sheen also gives an excellent performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair, and his resemblance only adds to it.<br/><br/>Helen McCrory, James Cromwell, Sylvia Syms (as the Queen Mother), Alex Jennings, and Roger Allam are all good, too. McCrory in particular does a fine job, but part of that can be credited to her uncanny resemblance to the real Mrs. Blair. Cromwell is fine, but the otherwise perfectly good performances of Syms and Jennings are in my opinion significantly harmed by the fact that neither look much like the person they're supposed to be playing.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Frears (who also helmed the wonderful Mrs. Henderson Presents) does a nice understated job here. The interspersing of real news footage is a nice touch and unquestionably adds to the realism; putting it on the TV currently being watched by the Queen is especially deft. The script (by Peter Morgan, who also penned The King of Scotland), is okay, but I frequently found myself questioning various parts and pieces of it. Though I understand the story was written after a good deal of research and with the assistance of those close to the Prime Minister or the Royal Family, there are private moments that must, by definition, have involved guesswork. While I'm tempted to believe some of the guesses are accurate, I can't quite push myself over the edge into buying into the movie as a whole, and that hurt my overall enjoyment of it more than I'd like to admit.<br/><br/>The Queen is a reasonably good movie with spectacular sets and locations, and some very, very good acting. Anyone who appreciates those things will like The Queen. Those who remember Diana's death and who, even now, suffer a twinge of pain as a result, will also find much of The Queen of interest. On the other hand, those who don't care, and those uninterested in a behind the scenes look at royal protocol, aren't going to find much else of value in this movie. I recommend The Queen, but not without some reservations.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Queen is rated PG-13 for ""brief strong language."" I don't really see much here that wouldn't be okay for the average viewer of about age 10 and up. But the story itself is sufficiently mature, and frankly the rendering of it so staid (in fairness, that was intentional and it does help to convey the stuffy and stifling history of it all) that children aren't going to enjoy themselves at all. As such, I'd save this one for some evening when it's just the adults who are headed out for an evening at the movies."

","As we walked into the theater(the previews were playing), the sound was so high it actually hurt our ears. Finally, we got the theater operator to turn down the sound. Five minutes into the movie we realized why the sound had been so loud. The conversation parts of this film were almost impossible to hear(this was in a theater with only 7 patrons).<br/><br/>This was especially true in scenes with royals, who tend to use the whisper as their normal speaking voice(except Phillip).<br/><br/>After getting the theater management to turn the sound back up, we soon realized it was not their fault, but instead poor sound production during the filming. Even at the theaters maximum sound output, hearing was still very difficult. The conversation portions of this film only emanated out of the front speakers. However when ever there was music or sound effects, the side side speakers kicked in and the volume got very high.<br/><br/>Why do movie makers think hearing conversation is less important than music or sound effects? This was a very good movie, sorry we could not hear much of it."

Besides just having a wonderful leading lady, a fine director, and a well-written script, it had more to it's name- It's just a very beautiful story.<br/><br/>The Queen of England is faced with a situation of what to do when Princess Diana is killed. She is demanded by the people to become a ""public mourner"" and change the way she's lived her entire life, all for a woman who chose against her family and stood for everything the Queen didn't.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren gives a fine performance in the lead role. She transforms herself completely into the character, and is instantly believable. You cannot help but understand what she's going through. She deserves her Best Actress nomination. Other than that, the supporting cast is generally average. Michael Sheen does turn in nice work as Tony Blair, the new Prime Minister who very much stands for change.<br/><br/>Ultiamtely, it's just a very good look at a very good woman. An excellent script from a very good story, and a wonderful leading performance. Don't be surprised if you are near tears more than once. There is one especially lovely scene near the end with a little girl holding flowers for a very special person. That scene is just one of many excellent throughout the film.

"Monotreme02","8","0","0","25 January 2007"," An expert work of aesthetic and subtlety
","Stephen Frears is an interesting director. His work is about as varied as it gets ¬ñ grand period dramas set in England (Dangerous Liaisons), romantic comedies set in Chicago (High Fidelity), and everything in between. The Queen is another interesting addition to his directorial resume, a resume filled with films that all have one thing in common: subtlety.<br/><br/>The Queen isn't a subtle film per se, as its core conflict - the conflict of interests between Tony Blair, connected to the people, and Queen Elizabeth II, standing firmly by the royal protocol as expected of her ¬ñ is prominent and obvious. The Queen's minor transformation is featured prominently and not hidden; it is not a film wallowing in secrecy and uncertainty. But it is a film that is directed with subtlety. Frears' camera is gentle, keeping still and always with his characters. Its movements are smooth and delicate, and nothing in the movie is ever sharp, angular or askew in any way. It is all very straight and formal and clean ¬ñ and what better subject matter to fit such aesthetics but the workings of the Royal family itself.<br/><br/>Similar to Capote last year, The Queen is a good but not extremely special film whose main performance elevates it to a great film with something unique to offer. Again, this isn't to say that The Queen is a bad film, or even an uninteresting one ¬ñ But it doesn't really have much to say aside from being a portrayal of the events in question. It also doesn't have much of a story exactly, but is rather an exact and in depth portrayal of events. The unfolding of events is interesting, but not particularly engaging as it is all very matter of fact. Luckily for the audience Michael Sheen portrays Tony Blair ¬ñ shy grin and casual nature ¬ñ in an extremely sympathetic way so the audience connects to him as our guide through this unfolding of events. But truly, it is Helen Mirren's performance that stands out above all other aspects of this film. And what a performance it is.<br/><br/>The first and foremost characteristic of The Queen is her restraint; she guards her emotions behind a stone-hard face, is always polite and gentle, speaks in always homely but never revealing tones, and in all is just a fa√ßade of graciousness and good manners. That Mirren emulates these aspects of the Queen's character even in the more intimate, behind-the-scenes events involving her family and close associates is impressive enough; but what makes her performance truly stand out are her reactions to these devastating events. Mirren lets just enough emotion slip through her Queen's stoic face to let the audience know how she feels, but while still exercising the restraint the character, the real Queen, would exercise. It's a performance that is never showy but always dominant, and one worth every admiration possible to give.<br/><br/>What is further interesting about the performance is how the film seemingly assembles itself around it. Frears' restrained, quiet, delicate direction is no coincidence ¬ñ it's a further extension of the Queen's own manners and behaviour. In the best scene in the entire film, we the audience are treated with an intimated moment with the Queen ¬ñ it is the only scene in which she is alone, only the audience with her. She begins to sob: there are no other sounds, no other distractions, and even further than that ¬ñ Frears has her with her back to the camera. What humbleness and modesty the Queen portrays at all moments ¬ñ even hiding her feelings and intimacy when she is alone."
"gttnmyphd","10","0","0","24 January 2007"," Helen Mirren is the QUEEN!
","Helen Mirren is amazing. The thing that was most breathtaking about her performance was it subtlety. It takes an actress who really believes in herself to make a character so believable without over acting. I think that's the difference between younger actresses and these tempered veterans. They have that special something, a confidence that allows them to harness the insides of their characters. We know so little about Queen Elizabeth. We eat only what the tabloids feed us and I know that's a perverse group that's poisoning the public to a large extent. In this movie, Helen's performance peels the onion for us and gives us a possibility of what the human side of this icon is. Truly inspired."
"floatmyboat","9","0","0","24 January 2007"," A closer look at events in the week of Lady Diana's death
","The Queen, directed by Stephen Frears, tells us the story of events unfolding in little over a week after Lady Diana's death. While a sufficient summary of the plot, it is secondary to this expansive landscape that elegantly captures the current state of Britain and its monarchy. Much of the story revolves around the reaction of the British monarchy, specifically Queen Elizabeth II, to Lady Diana's sudden demise. But the hundred or so minutes of the film cover a much broader set of topics.<br/><br/>The death of Lady Diana, shows the film, puts many things into motion - the galvanization of the anti-monarchy feeling, the massive rise in popularity of the then newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair, the rethinking of the monarchy's public behavior by the Queen, and of course the unbelievable media circus that took place. The film at many times, both directly and indirectly, gripes about the nature of the public reaction during that period. A few scenes, and the outburst of Tony Blair clearly comes to mind here, show the seemingly inhuman reaction of the monarchy in a more sane light.<br/><br/>All of the above is shown in a style that is delightfully British. Say what you will, there is nothing more biting than the cut of the British jib. In mere words can the Prime Minister of Britain be reduced to the stature of a peon. Add to that the carefully trained manners of the Queen that can express what words would do clumsily, and you have some choice rib-tickling moments as only British humor can provide.<br/><br/>The many characters covered in the film are portrayed par excellence. It just might be that the people themselves are darn fine specimens, each one showing varying degrees of self-involvement, prejudice, loathing, and so much more. Their interactions are positively fun to watch as well. The Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth (the mother) represent the Queen's traditional views, regularly backing up her stoic responses and pooh-poohing the public commotion. Cherie Blair, on the other hand, represents Tony Blair's modernist views, admonishing the deafening silence of the royal family and its general high-handedness. The Queen and Tony Blair themselves represent two sides of the spectrum that goes from traditional to modernist. By the end of the film they both see value in the other person's stance and are open enough to work together to learn more about the other.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren delivers a performance well-deserving of the high accolades it is receiving. Dignified and poised, yet human and, at times, even introspective and, dare I say, vulnerable, she shows the myriad sides of a Queen we know only through her rare public appearances. Through her portrayal, we see the Queen as a caring but private person, the vestige of an age of uprightness that seems anachronistic today. As the events unfold, and the sorrow of the people turns into a vulgar display of public demonstrations, she slowly realizes that the people of her country want something different from her. They need more drama and theatrics than quiet dignity, and that she might not be the right one to give them that. The film leaves us with the sense of optimism that the reins of Britain are in sane hands, but with a warning that the zeitgeist might change the institutions that we have always seen as unchanging."

Her portrayal was poignant,arrogant and unforgettable. Admittedly I am a tad bit obsessive about the Royals. I named my only daughter after Diana for Christ's sake. But this film was remarkable.

"MalcolmJTaylor","9","0","0","20 January 2007"," Mirren reigns as queen of acting in brisk biopic
","It's an odd sensation peeking into the lives of Monarchy. Since there are no reality TV shows on surviving the monarchy, a viewer just doesn't know how much is fiction and how much is fact. At times it seems too ordinary to be plausible and at others it feels too dramatically forced to be real. Yet all the way through you are riveted.<br/><br/>In the case of ""The Queen"" we vicariously peer into the life of HRM Queen Elizabeth the Second during the crucial week following the tragic death of Princess Diana. This film portrays the tensions caused by the monarch's knee-jerk stoic response, while popular outcry from her subjects demands a more intimate approach.<br/><br/>This film doesn't pull any punches showing clearly it falls on the side of portraying a monarchy that is dangerous out-of-touch with its subjects. An institution so entrenched in the culture of it's citizenry so as to seem indispensable is suddenly teetering on the brink of extinction with the death of the ""People's Princess"".<br/><br/>However, the subject matter itself may not be forefront on most audience member's minds that are only now discovering this film, well after it's pre-holiday release. The tide of critical praise and awards momentum building behind Helen Mirren's portrayal in the title role, culminating with a Golden Globe win for best actress last Monday night signaling a virtual shoe-in for an Oscar nomination, might be the real reason there are bums in the seats in front of this flickering gem.<br/><br/>What a surprise then to find such a well-crafted film behind it all. ""The Queen"" moves along quite briskly unlike it's rather stogy subject matter. Surprisingly, also unlike its chief subject, it is emotionally pliable, and pulls at all your weak-spots. The score, pacing and cinematography combine to make this a refreshingly agile ride for such a seemingly stale subject.<br/><br/>The acting, of course, is nothing short of sublime on the part of Ms. Mirren. Her portrayal is so subtle, so as to make her seem like the genuine article, while those around her seem like, well... mere actors in a movie about the queen. It is as if the producers hired Queen Elizabeth to play herself in a dramatic reenactment with the rest of the roles populated by thespians. After this performance it will be difficult for the queen herself to seem as real.<br/><br/>The comment is not to disparage the other performances in any way, it is simply to highlight just how elevated Ms. Mirren's craft is. For example the subtle look she gives at the end of her live address to the people is so incredibly subtle, yet so fierce and so clear. It is astonishing in it's depth and the facility with which she delivers it, holding you in a vice-grip by sheer telepathic force alone. It doesn't get any more real than this.<br/><br/>This film also delivers another top-notch performance, that by Michael Sheen, portraying Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is equal to the high bar set by Ms. Mirren, presenting a seamless and uncanny Blair.<br/><br/>Watching this film one can only hope director Stephen Frears is planning a sequel of sorts, dramatizing the plight of Blair and his controversial backing of Bush's war on terror, however that plays out. Indeed, Blair's eventual fall from grace is briefly prognosticated towards the end.<br/><br/>In addition to some beautiful cinematography, one of the most admirable crafts in this film has to be the editing. Great care is taken to seamlessly interweave real-life news events footage into the fictionalized world the actors and filmmakers inhabit. By doing so this film successfully navigates what would have been a massive stumbling block. Can you imagine any actress struggling to portray Princess Diana? How could anyone glow the way she did? Most biopics stubbornly refuse to combine the worlds of fiction and real-life. ""The Queen"" dealing with high profile media figures almost has no choice but to. <br/><br/>Biopics have never been more in vogue than they are these days. Some recent successes have been James Mangold's ""Walk the Line"" and Mirren's own real-life partner Taylor Hackford's ""Ray"".<br/><br/>""The Queen"" now ranks up there with these master works."
"GrimmBrother","8","0","0","20 January 2007"," A Great Film
","In September this year it will have been 10 years since Princess Diana died in a car accident while being hounded and perused by the paparazzi.<br/><br/>This film tells the story about how the Queen handled Diana's death between the time of Diana's passing and the funeral. It also focuses on Prime Minister Tony Blair when he first comes into power, as well as Prince Charles, Prince Phillip, the Queen Mother and of course the members of the British public.<br/><br/>The world is shaken by Diana's death and it appears that the royal family is doing nothing to address the issue. The Queen has not even appeared in public and this enrages people of the UK.<br/><br/>The Queen, as you all know, was not very fond of Diana at all. In fact, the entire Royal Family did not accept her as one of their own.<br/><br/>The Queen uses brilliant metaphoric symbols throughout the film which is left for the viewer to pick out.<br/><br/>It also uses real footage of Diana and the public's reactions.<br/><br/>However, everything else is acted and by exceptional actors at that. Michael Sheen is a very talented actor who pulls off the role of Tony Blair as if he were the Prime Minister himself.<br/><br/>But Helen Mirren is of course the true star. Watching this film is just like watching the real Queen Elizabeth II. Helen portrays every aspect of the Queen perfectly, which will surely earn her a Best Actress Oscar.<br/><br/>The Queen will probably not take home the Best Picture Award. That is surely to go the The Departed but it is still a marvelous film that deserves an excellent 8/10."
"DonFishies","8","0","0","17 January 2007"," Interesting, and backed with a majestic performance from Mirren
","I was apprehensive about seeing The Queen when it first came out. Yeah, it had the Oscar buzz, but it really did not seem like it would be anything special. I had seen Capote the year before and almost fell asleep in the theatre with how boring it was, save for the earth-shattering performance from Phillip Seymour Hoffman. But with the continued buzz, I just could not help myself, and surprisingly, it was a whole lot better than I imagined it would be.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren plays the titular role of Elizabeth II in the film which takes place in 1997. Following a short interlude in May during the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) to Prime Minister, the film quickly changes to August on the night of Princess Diana's death. The monarchy is visibly shaken up, but refuses to say anything to the equally shaken up British public. The film then chronicles the week leading up to Diana's funeral, and hypothetically plays out what happened during this time.<br/><br/>While the movie is not perfect, it is much more than just a platform ""Oscar-gimme"" for Mirren. The film is interesting and enlightening all at once in its depiction of the royal family. One would imagine it would be quite a spectacle behind closed doors, but they are played off to be just like every other family (of course, with a sprawlingly lengthy and beautiful backyard). The amazing photography and costume designs really pull forward the absolute majesty of the monarchy, and feel intensely authentic. I also liked how, even with the accents, the characters did not seem overly British. Some films really amp up the accent, but here, it is very low key, and barely noticeable. It was a nice change of pace, and made it not feel totally different like other foreign films. I also liked how the film made great use of archived newspapers and television broadcasts from the time. It helped make the film much more historically accurate, and allowed the film's events feel more recent than it is.<br/><br/>The writing is note-worthy in how well it was done to produce a hypothetical story for what happened over those few days. It informs, while humouring the audience from time to time. The humanization of the royal family is not an easy task, but writer Peter Morgan really pulls through in how well his characters are written. Of course, it also packs in a bit too much action over this one week period. Some moments are totally worthwhile, while others just feel tacked on for no reason. It makes the film feel boring at times, and allows it to lose the edge it had going in. Other scenes are whip fast, and perfect in their length, so it really just feels like an issue that should have been dealt with during editing. A particular sequence involving Mirren and Sheen quickly jumps from a regular visit to see the Queen, to a total politically driven mockery of Tony Blair. It felt totally out of place, and more of just something to giggle at than something that actually was worth putting into the film.<br/><br/>As pointed out already, Mirren is absolutely awe-inspiring in her role. Her look, mannerisms, body language and speech all look and sound exactly like the real Queen. She embodies her character much like Hoffman did Truman Capote, and she breathes life into an otherwise only momentarily interesting public figure. Her majesty and grace may look simple, but you can see just how much work she has put into the role to make it feel more than just believable. This is the kind of role that really shakes things up, and proves how well some actors can act on screen, and how much better she is than the majority of working actors today. I will say though, for all of the hype and amazement being placed on the role, she did not strike me as nearly astonishing as Hoffman or Jamie Foxx. She does a much better job than Charlize Theron did in Monster, but then again, Mirren's acting really has not changed all that drastically like Theron's did for her role.<br/><br/>The supporting cast does a very amicable job in their roles, and again, are not completely pushed away by the majesty of Mirren. Sheen's spot-on performance of Tony Blair is particularly well done, and plays off wonderfully against Mirren and on his own. He has some genuine charisma in this role, and has just the right amount of timidness. Blair was fresh off of his election when Diana died, and you can see how well Sheen handles the daunting task of how he handled the situation being so new in office. James Cromwell also does pretty well for himself as Prince Phillip, as does Alex Jennings as Prince Charles (besides not totally looking all that much like Charles, particularly in his ears).<br/><br/>It has some editing issues, but on the whole, The Queen is a whole lot better than what I expected. It is interesting, and has an excellent and award-worthy performance from Helen Mirren to back it up. Definitely one to check out.<br/><br/>8/10."
"ndtm","9","0","0","16 January 2007"," Perfect Mix
","Loved this movie. Helen Mirren was perfect in the role; you truly believe she is Queen Elizabeth II. I thought they achieved the perfect mix of showing how the royal family was so out of touch with the public, while also being fair to them as human beings, and therefore the products of their own upbringing. Tony Blair's portrayal balanced this perfectly, as someone who initially holds little respect for the royals and their traditions, but gains sympathy when realizing they have challenges and demands of their own. He helps the royal family regain the respect of the British public without betraying his own feelings towards the Monarchy. Sheree Blair is also very well done, as an independent and intelligent woman not afraid to voice her own opinions.<br/><br/>But the star is clearly Helen Mirren. Saying so much in so few words, or with only a look or gesture. And the scene where she sees the large buck (when her jeep breaks down) will stay with me as one of the key emotional highs of the film. The portrayal of Prince Philip was also very well done. With a father like Philip, it's clear how Charles turned out as he did (i.e. another cold fish).<br/><br/>I was sorry that more time wasn't spent on Charles or the boys, but of course this would have made it quite a different film. As it was, there was just enough background story, to remind everyone of the key aspects of Charles and Diana's marriage and problems.<br/><br/>The use of news footage was also very well done, and combined with Helen Mirren's performance, often gave the feel of watching a documentary, not a movie. Brilliant."

She plays the Queen as someone whos life is their duty and vice versa. And sometimes it's difficuilt to know where one begins and ends. This is not someone that one cosies up to in any shape or form, as Charles makes clear in one of his comments to her.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen plays Tony Blair in a picture perfect portrayal in his mannerisms of the time and of a Prime Minister getting used to the reins of power.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren was an excellent choice to play her and her resemblance after make-up is incredible.

It goes someway in explaining the Royal families reaction and the characters present. Was it really a tipping point for the monarchy or was it a case of journalistic excess? I don't think so but it makes for an entertaining film with some interesting insights into the royal and ministerial households with their totally different styles; one stuck in a unyielding past and the other a more labile, relaxed future.<br/><br/>As with my prediction for Scorcese to win for THE DEPARTED (9/10) in the Oscars, I would suggest a flutter on Mirren as a sure thing for best actress.

","Helen Mirren does a perfectly marvelous job of inhabiting the persona of Queen Elizabeth II, James Cromwell deserves much more praise than he has received for his Prince Phillip, and Michael Sheen gives a good imitation of Tony Blair. But the story of the Royal Family's stiff and unfeeling response to the death of Princess Diana surrounds documentary material about the Princess' life and death and (I'm assuming) actual scenes of the grief it produced on the part of ordinary Britons. Diana's death is at the core of this film and, though I find it hard to understand, I was repelled by that fact. Everyone knew at the time that the Royal Family was happy to be rid of this troublesome young woman, mother of a future British king, and that their late and limited response to Diana's tragic death was more or less forced on them for their own good by Tony Blair, and yet I wasn't pleased to watch it reenacted despite the acting. Still, Mirren will probably win many prizes and Cromwell should (though he probably won't). Is Prince Phillip really as much of a self-satisfied fool as he is portrayed? I think he probably is."

This family, the Royal Family, are almost impossible to take seriously; they walk around in kilts, play silly games and stalk stags when they should be facing up to the tragedy that has just entered their lives; to portray the royal family as it is portrayed in this movie is a plus for director Frears and the performance from Helen Mirren as The Queen will probably win her an Oscar with a nomination, at least, for Michael Sheen who plays Tony Blair. <br/><br/>After all this meticulous casting and care how did Stephen Frears allow some kind of Prince Charles impersonator to play Prince Charles? <br/><br/>The portrayal of Charles in this movie, both by the actor who plays him, the writer who wrote it that way and the director who let it be played that way is a disgrace; let us not forget who Charles is and where he came from; look at some of his biography on IMDb: 'In 1968, he graduated college, becoming the first heir to the British throne to graduate college. Later that year he was formally invested as Prince of Wales, a title he received in 1957. He dated many women, two of whom are Camilla Shand (later known as Camilla Parker-Bowles), and Sarah Spencer, the sister of his future wife.' 'His first military services appointment was in 1969. He currently holds the rank of captain in the Royal Navy and group captain in the Royal Air Force. His favourite food is scrambled eggs and he likes to drink whiskey. He enjoys going to Scotland, UK; Klosters, Switzerland; and the Eleuthra in the Caribbean. He enjoys hunting, shooting, fishing, polo, skiing, painting, writing and reading.' Does this sound like a man who 'thought he heard a shot' when a car back fired; does it sound like someone who would ask for 'extra protection' ¬ñ as they say in the movie ¬ñ because of that shot which got a big laugh at the intimated cowardly Charles on the night I saw it at the Arclight in Hollywood last week? <br/><br/>Did we really have to see the silly pulling of faces like the 'Spitting Image' puppets that portrayed him on Television and the bending of the mouth like a demented Frank Spencer? We have all seen footage of Charles standing next to the five feet ten Diana and being just under her height ¬ñ she used to wear flat shoes when she was with him so as not to tower over him and we have seen Tony Blair stand next to George W. Bush; Blair stands one inch higher than the five feet eleven Bush; in this film Prince Charles is played about six inches taller than Blair ¬ñ six feet six!!!! <br/><br/>This film could have been so good ¬ñ in fact it was if you ignored the portrayal of Prince Charles, the fish fingers for Tony Blair's dinner (this is a sophisticated man whether you like him or not) and the Newcastle football shirt he wears around the house with his name on the back. There will be other films made of this period in the history of Britain's Royal Family and when it is played by people who don't necessarily look like the people they are playing maybe we will see it in a better light ¬ñ rather like Helen Mirren's portrayal of Elizabeth I recently."
"rhjph","3","2","5","3 April 2016"," Compelling story let down by wooden acting
","I sat down to watch this in the happy expectation I would enjoy it. It's a riveting story, a well- crafted film and with a screenplay that has its nuanced moments. But then it has its clunky ones too (e.g. "" Tay Bridge? But that's the code-name for my funeral"", as everyone else in the room knows full well). Much of the dialogue is laboured, and unlikely. The Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Mother and Prince Charles, all played by front-rank actors and actresses, come across as wooden mimics, and wholly fail to catch the personalities of the parts they are playing. One can always rely on Helen Mirren to redeem a questionable role, but not it seems here. As with the others she misses the essential spirit of the Queen's stoicism: good humour in the face of adversity. An upright posture and abrupt transition from misery to jollity does not capture it. Almost all the 'aristocrats' stiffly bypass what ought to be an easy ability to combine great formality with great informality, sensitivity with authority, humour with seriousness. The sparkle in the eye is replaced with dead stereotyping. Prince Philip is gauche, the Queen Mother a pantomime dame and Prince Charles is without personality at all. Michael Sheen comes close, but does not do Blair as well here as he has elsewhere. Helen McCrory has a good stab at Cherie, but takes it too far into the obvious, as does Mark Bazeley as Alastair Campbell. The only part that truly convinces is Roger Allam as Robin Janvrin, who glues the whole thing together with the effortlessness one would expect of the role. All in all a surprisingly disappointing film, that promised to be much better than, in the end, it was."
"jboothmillard","8","2","5","26 February 2007"," The Queen
","From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Stephen Frears (Mrs. Henderson Presents), this is very good interpretation of Britain's modern monarch, crowned in 1953, ending the 20th Century, and still on the throne in the 21st. Anyway, the film starts with young Tony Blair (BAFTA nominated Michael Sheen) becoming the new Prime, and obviously meeting Queen Elizabeth II (Oscar winning Dame Helen Mirren. The main plot for the story comes along though with the tragic fatal car crash of Princess Diana in 1997. The press and public are all tearful and shocked at the incident, but are enraged at the fact that none of the royal family, particularly the Queen, not coming out to public to speak of the incident. It is only when planning the funeral that the Queen will appear, and the celebrity filled event is when the public really see her. The film is mainly made up of a lot of decisions after the event, and a lot of real iconic newsreel footage and powerful re-creation. Also starring James Cromwell as Prince Philip, Sylvia Syms as H.M. The Queen Mother, Alex Jennings as Prince Charles and Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair. I am glad that Mirren won the Oscar (only winner), BAFTA and Golden Globe with a lookalike and very intriguing performance, it would have been interesting to see what would have happened if she was not knighted before the film, but she had tea at the palace. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Music for Alexandre Desplat, Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for Best Film, and it was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up & Hair, and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Dame Helen Mirren was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses. Very good!"

","I can understand why the reviewer 'soflwrs' of Brighton, England did not want to comment on the politics of this movie. Nonetheless it seems to me the fact that this movie was made (allowed to be made at all) is a fairly obvious political statement. The role and need for a monarchy was sorely tested during the period of time covered by the film and the final message to me was of yet another patch being applied to an ailing institution. And where did the scriptwriters get their 'royal dialog' from? is it fiction or fact? Pathe News, champions of wartime propaganda, could not have done a better job. As for the title, 'The Queen' this is a little broad for a movie that spans but a minute portion of this Monarchs reign. Actors portraying modern day people never quite works, and with so many in this movie, judging the casting directors choice of actor constantly diverted my attention from the storyline. Despite all that, I found the movie mildly entertaining."
"quaintone","5","2","5","23 January 2007"," Disappointing
","A very disappointing film and totally overrated. Helen Mirren's excellent acting cannot detract from the fact that she is physically wrong for the part. She seems too serene and sophisticated. More like an older Diana. I wondered if this was perhaps the intention of Stephen Frears to make this a feature of how Diana's death was having such an impact on the lives of the Royals. After all they all thought she was ""out of her mind"" and a ""walking cannon"". After the Queen reluctantly delivered her obituary speech for Diana she was reported as saying ""Was that moving enough for you?"" To me a much less worldly character portrayal would have made a more interesting contrast. After all we witnessed her Majesty on BBC programs,etc which should have shown her ordinariness and served as a guide. The Queen is a well known huntress and even strangled a wounded bird at one time. I felt no particular sympathy for this character, even though the well written and directed film urged me to do so."

Helen Mirren playing an emotionally inhibited, superior British woman. Same tired blah, blah, blah about the royals not liking Diana and vice versa. Same message about the royals being out of touch with contemporary sensibilities (no! really?). Same guesswork about what the daily life of the family looks like. I suppose royalty fans will like it.<br/><br/>Now, what might be meaningful is if, 50-ish years from now, the royals are gone and someone, some day, wonders why they were eased out. This movie would give them a clue. There were no sympathetic portrayals here."

","What a disappointment! A difficult task at best, a real life docu - drama with characters from a comedy sketch, this film is like the royal family itself....pompous, silly, full of itself, without character. NO one is even remotely likable. Seeing an actor in kilts pretending to be Prince Charles, what was that?? Perhaps it was the British accents, or the harried nature of the discussions (PM staff, etc.), but many of the lines were unintelligible. The only redeeming aspect of this film was the majestic scenery of the Scottish highlands. Perhaps the said could be said for some of the beautiful interiors and gardens. But if that is what you want, get a recent copy of House & Garden! <br/><br/>Better off just recalling those events on your own."
"DICK STEEL","8","2","6","30 December 2006"," A Nutshell Review: The Queen
","This is as much a movie on Queen Elizabeth II as it is on current British PM Tony Blair. With the movie starting from Blair's win at the elections, and being a new PM expected to usher in change, his character here is in opposites with the Queen's, one steeped in stifling tradition of the monarchy. But while<br/><br/>The movie contains some excellent blending of archived footage from news bulletins to images shot with that look and feel of a television feed, as well as dramatized elements which tried to tell the story of what really happened behind the scenes. With the crux of the story focused on the period of time immediately after Princess Di's death in 1997 (wow, it's been almost 10 years), it's usually landmark events like these which people remember what the Queen / Monarchy did, versus the period of approximately 50 years she had ascended the throne.<br/><br/>Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears, The Queen is an excellent character study piece of one of the world's longest surviving monarchies, as well as arguably the one with the most scandals and controversies. One must bear in mind that this is fiction and by no means representative of actual events, though it is a fictional version with the possibility of putting OEII in better light, given her reaction of no response to the public immediately after the tragic news. The story and plot are nothing new, and therefore offer no such thing as a shocking plot twist, or controversial scenes, although the movie's attempts to provide an explanation from the other side of Buckingham will be its attraction.<br/><br/>Much has been said about actress Helen Mirren's outstanding performance as QEII, and I'm of the opinion that she deserves every accolade bestowed upon her, and is indeed a strong contender to snag that Oscar come Feb 2007. But kudos must go to her costars as well, like James Cromwell as husband Prince Philip, Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother, Alex Jennings as Prince Charles, but more importantly, Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. The makeup and wardrobe department also deserve mention to create the physical resemblance, which probably would assist loads in having the actors flesh out their respective characters.<br/><br/>It's an interesting look into the workings of the monarchy, and the relationship amongst the members. For those curious as to the relationship between the government and the monarchy will appreciate the many moments of interaction between Blair and the Queen."
"kerrytwilliams","5","2","6","27 December 2006"," Awful assumptions
","I was extremely disappointed by this movie. Having lived in the UK for more than 2 years, I still feel the assumptions made by the perception of the Royal Family are appalling. Having said that, Helen Mirren is superb - Oscar-worthy, however, the idea of making the Royal Family this most awful entity and Tony Blair, the Saint, is preposterous. Blair is made out to be this ""dish-washing"" pleb, and the Queen the most pompous arrogant snob. How can we have any idea what really went down? All I'm saying is that this movie is based on tabloid-like assumptions and we have no idea of the real feelings of the Royal Family. Of course it makes sense for us to hate the Royal Family with regards to their feelings for Diana, but we don't know this to be true. The film is based on the exploitation of emotional distress for the death of Diana. If the Queen was really so awful, Prince's William and Harry would have detected this. As an Anti-Monarchist I still think this movie has misportrayed the Queen. She's not stupid, and would never have been as awful as portrayed, in front of her grandchildren."

"classicsoncall","8","1","2","18 October 2017"," ""I don't think I shall ever understand what happened this summer.""
","What I'd like to know is what really, really went on behind the closed doors of Buckingham Castle following the death of Princess Diana. I think the movie probably got a lot of it right. If one followed the history of Diana and her fairy tale wedding to Prince Charles, then you surely were aware of the aftermath when the marriage fell apart and the 'former' Princess took on humanitarian causes and quite inadvertently embarrassed the Royal Family with her post-marital associations. The positive reviewers for this film found a nobility in Queen Elizabeth's (Helen Mirren) attempt to stay above the public fray during the week following Diana's death, but for others, like myself, I can't imagine how she and the rest of The Royals so misjudged the public mood with their tone deaf response. All of this is brought forth successfully by the picture, as well as the ameliorating effect the new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) had on Elizabeth after a number of head butts against a wall of Royal bashers. Of course, the press took to their usual voyeuristic initiative to paint a grim picture of the Royal Family, eventually leading to some acquiescence on the part of The Queen. In her role, Helen Mirren is quite extraordinary, quite deserving of the 2007 Best Actress recognition, though I question whether the film makers selected a proper title for this film. In many respects, it plays more like 'The Queen's Tantrum'."
"filipemanuelneto","9","1","2","11 June 2016"," Seven days that changed the face of the monarchy
","This film deals with a character still alive and contemporary for us all: Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, one of the oldest monarchs in recent history and one of the most influential figures in the world. In this film, she faces the dramatic days following the death of Princess Diana. Directed by Stephen Frears, the film has script by Peter Morgan and has Helen Mirren in the title role.<br/><br/>Princess Diana was, as long as she lived, one of the most powerful and influential figures of European royalty, helping to popularize and modernize the monarchy the same way that, decades earlier, Grace Kelly did. Even today, there are people with very different views of Diana. Some people idolized her, other despised her and didn't like the way that, allegedly, she manipulated yellow press. Ironically, even her death is subject of debate and doubts. However, most people agreed about the antipathy between herself and the Queen, her mother-in- law. The film deals with the difficulties of the monarch to react to the death of a woman she inwardly abhorred, and the danger that unpopularity represents today to the old monarchical gears.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren surprised at the role of the British sovereign. She turned on her, gave her body, soul and life of an absolutely brilliant way, worthy of the Oscar for Best Leading Actress she won. She managed to give the public the image of a woman torn between what to do and to show, and what she really feels and wants. A woman educated to rule and not show weakness, keeping her composure under any circumstances and following the protocol, even when people demanded it to be broken. The film even shows one of the lesser known truths of this monarch, which is that of knowing how to drive, thanks to the period she spent as British Army auto mechanics. Michael Sheen also shone, in the role of Tony Blair, a smart prime minister who quickly realized what the Queen was slow to understand: that the will of the people was overlapping the state protocol.<br/><br/>The makeup and costume work was at the highest level. The scenarios also helped to set up the characters and show the everyday life of British royalty, without falling into the clich√© of the luxurious and impersonal rooms, usually found in royal palaces. The photograph fulfills its role with intelligence and the soundtrack, by Alexandre Desplat, is excellent and fits perfectly to the film."
"hendrik-m","7","1","2","17 April 2013"," The Queen
","Summary: The movie ""The Queen"" ,from Stephen Freas, was released in 2006. It deals with Lady Diana's death, the Queen's reaction towards it and how the new Prime minister, Tony Blair (Martin Sheen), changes her behavior. The Film takes place in 1997. The movie begins with , the entering of the new Prime minister. The Queen receives Tony Blair in a short and ceremonial. Tony Blair, who has become Prime minister to modernize the UK and now he is eyeball to eyeball with the traditional monarchy. The main storyline begins when the Queen is awakened by a servant. He tells the Queen and her husband that something happened to Diana. The Queen's husband's first reaction is to ask what she did again. When they get informed that she had a bad car accident they show no emotions, what is crossed through the whole movie. Nearly at the same time Tony Blair is informed and his response is completely different. He is shocked from the news and instantly calls the Queen to arrange the official reaction. His plan is to fly to Paris. Only heavily the Queen can be convinced. The decision to give no statement, because Diana is not a member of the royal family anymore will bring her big problems. The next morning Tony Blair on the contrary gives on the next morning his first statement where he points out his grief towards Diana's death. He names Diana the ""princess of the hearts"" which brings him a lot of popularity. The royal family decides to remain behind closed doors, in Balmoral Castle, which turns out as a big mistake. The heartbroken public and media pass criticism on their Queen. In Balmoral Castle the Queen and her husband curiously follow the media. They are shocked about the reaction of the public. But the queen decides against all recommendations to stay and to give no statement. The next request by the public is to fly the flag over Buckingham Palace on half-mast. This would be against the royal protocol so the Queen forbids it. While the royal family spends their holidays the voices against the monarchy get louder and louder. During a trip in the wilderness the queen's car breaks down and she has to wait for help. This is the only scene in the whole movie where she is completely alone. While she sits and waits for help, she sees a beautiful stag. She hears shooting and barking and starts to cry. This is one of the two scenes where she is shown as a human being and not as the head of state. In the end Tony Blair can convince the Queen to make a public funeral service. When she comes back to London and sees the tons of flowers in front of the Buckingham palace she is about to cry. When she meets Tony Blair again she takes more time to talk to him and invites him for walk.<br/><br/>The movie ""The Queen"" in my opinion is a good movie which deals with monarchy in a critical way. The acting performance of Helen Mirren and Martin Sheen is excellent. The Oscar for Mirren is definitely legitimated. With the original TV sequences and the acting performance of all the actors the movie seems very authentic. I think everyone who thinks critically about monarchy should watch it. It shows the real face of the royal family, but also the big public pressure.<br/><br/>Republicans will enjoy it."

The movie shows how stubborn and cold-blooded was the reaction of the Queen (the British monarchy in general) towards Diana's death, then the tune of the movie turned topsy-turvy by showing how the Queen had a sense of flexibility (even if unwillingly)and listened finally to the advice of the modernizer Tony Blair!

","'This' is what would happen if you commissioned those nasty people from the Daily Mail and The Sun to produce a film about the death of Diana. Not that I am going to bother researching it but I imagine at least some tenuous relation between the 'red-tops' and The Queen (the film) (yes yes, The Daily Mail masquerades as a Tabloid).<br/><br/>There is just too much similarity between the opinions of these papers and the opinions of this film. If there is no causal link, then this film is extraordinarily barren of imagination, excruciatingly unoriginal, and by-far no-way impartial whatsoever ¬Önoooo, not one little incy bit, nope, nah-hah. It seems it has used narrow media perceptions as its one and only source. Well done there. However, it is subtle about being partial, which eventually comes across as a collection of cheap digs on the whole event/people. Plaeh! is the best sound I could ever use to describe this process.<br/><br/>Peter Morgan has conjured up some of my all time favourite films; he must have been coerced by some growing underground antimonarchist network.<br/><br/>If you haven't guessed, this film offers nothing new to the events surrounding Diana; just the memories of where you were at time and how you felt about it. I am neither a fan or grand mourner of Diana nor the ""death of the respect for the monarchy"", and generally indifferent to the lives of the divine. Consequently, I am lamebrain in how much I know about Diana's death¬Öbut still this film gave me nothing new. Perhaps I am missing the point because I am indifferent. But this reduces the film to just a memory eliciting device; doesn't it? Sadly, no (rant over). It gives two incredible performances, whose acting ability makes these unbelievable modern political heroes believable; even within their deep eccentricities and overly mediarised caricatures. These stunning performances mesmerise you to begin with, but this is the end of noughties! And if we were attentionally disabled in the 1990s then today we have the attention of an ADHD fly lost in the hall of mirrors (i.e. we need more).<br/><br/>(Rant reprise) I appreciate some people may like this film, but heart-felt memories don't make a good film ‚Äì give the award to someone else. They have cleverly capitalised on these memories, sensitive to the notion that a decade has past ‚Äì both emotional tastes are intact with social-acceptance at its most opportune.

"Benjamin_Cox","8","1","2","12 July 2008"," Helen Mirren leads a faultless cast in an absorbing and unusual biopic - 85%
","Movies based on a true story usually fall into two categories. Those which can't fail to stir the spirit with a rousing tale of triumph over tragedy (""Alive"", for example) and those which end up on some commercial cable channel in the middle of the afternoon. Movies based around living people are even rarer and even more hit-and-miss. But I'm happy to say that this is a real masterpiece, dominated by Helen Mirren and rightly so but it would be hugely amiss not to mention the rest of the cast who are pretty much faultless throughout.<br/><br/>""The Queen"" focuses on the week immediately after the death of Diana, Princess Of Wales in a car crash in 1997. The newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) leads the nation in their grief - primarily at the bidding of spin doctor Alastair Campbell (Mark Bazeley) - but the Queen (Mirren) is determined to keep things low-key and private, despite the increasing amount of public opinion against the Royal Family. As she struggles to hold her family together at Balmoral, she faces a crisis of confidence when she realises how badly she has handled matters.<br/><br/>It may be fairly short but ""The Queen"" is an astonishing piece of film. Based loosely around real events, it conjures up a mixture of fascination and sympathy for the Royal Family as well as memories of that fateful day. At no point is it tacky or intrusive - the crash itself is only partially seen and primarily made up of news reports from the time, making this almost seem like a documentary. A feeling amplified by the simply stunning cast. The only real (slight) disappointment is James Cromwell as Prince Phillip but the entire cast can look at this movie and be rightly proud of their performance. Mirren and Sheen match each other line from line, not only looking and sounding like their real-life counterparts but managing to evoke real sympathy for both characters. The scenes between Tony Blair and his anti-monarchy wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) arguing at home over the breakfast table are surreal to watch and I suspect that the character of Alastair Campbell was himself ""sexed up"" to make him slimier and nastier in the movie than he was/is in real life.<br/><br/>I honestly thought I wouldn't like this film but nothing makes me happier to be proved wrong on this occasion. It's not something that will grab the attention of everybody but for sheer acting brilliance, you'd be hard pressed to beat ""The Queen"". Being believable and captivating in equal measures is no easy feat for any ""true story"" flick (though ""The Queen"" is only half-based in fact) but with a killer screenplay and wonderful performances at every level, this is one movie that every serious film fan should watch. It won't be to everybody's taste (my Better Half found it slow and boring, though she too raved about the acting) but because it's so unusual to see these people on screen, talking about events that are still very much in the minds of the audience, it's remarkable how well the film pulls you in and refuses to let go. Good on you, ma'am!"
"Chris Brown","9","1","2","7 May 2008"," a wonderful lesson in humanity
","This film follows Elizabeth II, queen of the United Kingdom, and Tony Blair at the time of Princess Diana's death. Elizabeth, played by Helen Mirren, is a rich character. The goal of the director was not to praise or to condemn the queen or her actions. What this film achieves is much greater than making you love or hate Elizabeth. Instead, this film leads you to consider the fact that every celebrity you see on television, every stranger you see on the street, and every friend or enemy you've found in life is simply human. Every one of them has committed some sin at some point in life, and yet every one of them has suffered. Every human is imperfect, yet we all deserve some sympathy at some point.<br/><br/>Elizabeth, like many famous people, is someone whom we have all seen on television many times. Some people envy or even despise her for her easy life. True, I would prefer to be born into great wealth than great poverty, but one is being naive if one believes that queens never struggle. In this film, we see that Elizabeth tries very hard to do what is right, but she suffers when many people are outraged by her actions. Like all of us (but on a much greater scale), the queen struggles with the old adage that states, ""You can't please all the people all the time."" <br/><br/>Does the incredible weight of the queen's struggles put her on a pedestal high above us, her flawed subjects who fail to understand the difficulties of her existence? Not at all. On the contrary, this film shows us that Elizabeth has just as much trouble understanding her subjects as they have understanding her. Thus, the queen's flaws equal the flaws of the commoners. Ultimately, the lesson is that the queen is simply human. Like the rest of us, she tries to do what is right but often fails. Like all of us, she is flawed."

I wasn't a fan of Princess Diana and I certainly don't care about British politics but I don't think I blink once during the entire film. It was so strong that it really kept me into it from start to finish.

The range of this actress is quite simply incredible. She can do no wrong and here she is simply superb.<br/><br/>As ""The Queen"" Helen indeed fleshes out a royal most of the world knows very little about and therefore has made all sorts of unfounded assumptions about as well. This also takes place during a very taxing time in anyone's life, much less a family so public as this. Helen manages to make Queen Elizabeth quite human, trying in the midst of the turmoil surrounding the death of Princess Diana to deal with the situation as best as she knows how. She reacts like a woman who has pledged her life to her country first, then as a mother, and then as a grandmother. Her impatience with Princess Diana recounts any mother-in-law's impatience with her ex-daughter-in-law; the added variable of this being the royal family of England makes it all the more complicated. Before seeing this, I, like I imagine a lot of us, also thought the Queen was entirely too disconnected. But things are not always as they seem. Of course some of the Queen's actions are questionable and maybe some of her behavior may not be excused, but at least this presentation endeavors to at least submit motives behind those actions.<br/><br/>The film moves quickly, is actually quite witty, the writing is top-notch with Helen's performance, of course, being the driving force. A most poignant scene is her reaction to seeing the elk?, deer"", (whatever) in the woods before it is eventually hunted down for sport. It is a classic example of stopping to smell the roses in the midst of a most intense human drama.<br/><br/>To say I highly recommend is a masterpiece of understatement. Excellent movie!"

It is masterfully directed by Stephen Frears who used live footage that was taken from news reels done at that time and melded them in with the film. The writing is great and the story is great being able to look into the private life of the longest living monarch for Britain. However, what takes everyone's breath away is Helen Mirren's performance. Wow. See it. You will have your money's worth.

Bovarism, after Madame Bovary, was one of Aldous Huxley's favourite adjectives, and it means pretending to have feelings which one doesn't really have. The results, as he so scathingly portrayed, can only be disastrous. But the Great Blubbering British Public, pawn of the media, bald and obese and with leisure time on its hands, its stiff upper lip quivering like crazy and righteous indignation on its side, wanted to have a Great British Cry and a Big British Sulk over their Favourite Royal Personage, a public figure who came out with some of the silliest and creepiest comments ever heard, and turn what should have been a private affair into a cabaret spectacle. Blood on their hands ¬ñ what absolute twaddle! Then go off and give the likes of Elton John a popularity boost while you're still sobbing your socks off. Makes you proud to be British, doesn't it? If nothing else, this film does demonstrate how easily means of communication manipulate public opinion, and that's always just a step away from some fanatic coming into power.

","There was a time, I believe, when to depict any living member of Britain's Royal Family was simply not allowed, whether by law or Royal Proclamation I'm not sure. I guess the rules were changed somewhere down the line. What hasn't changed is the Royal Family's inability to respond, to fight back, publicly, their only refuge being to ""rise above."" Revenge is not in their arsenal.<br/><br/>Brits and Canadians and New Zealanders and Aussies, and others, will tell you that while their feelings may be mixed (in the same way that they can be with parents), the very idea of Royalty, uniting together a Kingdom, with its central theme of continuity and tradition and dignity and its separation from the ever-changing politics of the day, make for an emotional tear-in-the-eye response from those who have ever been connected to, for example, soldiers or sailors or airmen. Symbols abound; HMS, the Red Duster, Royal Mail, products produced ""By Appointment to ..."", the Changing of the Guard, ""Great"" Britain, the Opening of Parliament, the Christmas speech, the Victoria Cross, Westminster Abbey, the myriad name appendages of Sir and Lord, and other honors (admittedly not always deserved.)<br/><br/>In short, for reasons that are hugely subjective and incapable of being pinned down, we, and I am one of the majority who wouldn't have it any other way, are left with National Pride. Being so, a fictional and personalized account of current royal life promoted by an opportunistic for-profit commercial enterprise, is an affront. And it's not a matter of whether such accounts of royal goings-on of the living are truthful - as if anyone knows - but to pretend to know is a lie and an impertinence. Their interactions should remain private - and a mystery, until such time as they pass into history. Then, and only then, have at them by all means. Portrayals such as ""The Queen"" are, simply put, ill-intentioned and damaging, especially if they are well made; they contribute only negative input. Unless we want to end up a floundering Republican mess, like the U.S. of A."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","2","17 July 2007"," It should have been called 'Blair'
","The Queen's film title is a bit misleading as this isn't a film about the Queen or her life, but about the manner in which the monarchy reacted to the untimely death of Princess Diana and of how much at odds to the mood of the public this reaction was. As such, it works very well, juxtaposing the royal family's stiff-upper-lip approach to the situation, more correctly belonging to a past generation, with the uncharacteristic public display of grief from the public. In fact, we see no real grief as such from any member of the royals (William and Harry are frequently referred to but play no major part in the film). This change in the nation's outlook and behaviour is signified by the landslide victory of Tony Blair at the general election just a few months before Diana's death, and the rejection of the conservative values under which the country had been governed for the previous eighteen years.<br/><br/>The story is allegedly closely based on real conversations that took place during the week following Diana's death and, it has to be said, to me it looked a little too much like an Uncle Tony love-fest. In touch with the nation, resolute in his convictions, and his own man despite the machinations on his behalf by a breezily cynical Alistair Campbell, Blair comes out of the production as a true prince. I almost ended up liking him myself, and I can't stand the bloke in real life. Cherie too, true to her own anti-royalist beliefs, while not perhaps gleaming as brightly as her husband, still comes out of the whole thing with a positive slant. For me, this has to throw into question the veracity of the maker's claims that events on screen closely mirror those in real life. The film is too pro-Blair (even to the point of fabricating his embarrassment during his first audience with the Queen to, presumably, provoke audience sympathy with his character ¬ñ and to coax it away from the Queen).<br/><br/>Mirren is near faultless as HRH (as is Michael Sheen as Blair) and, while it has to be said that she is never treated as anything less than a fair and caring person, prone to the same self-doubts and concerns experienced by us all at some time or another, she emerges in only a slightly better light than when the film began. And even this is only because Blair helped her to see the light and get a little more in tune with the people. The rest of the royal family are treated as the stereotypical nutters the popular press would have us believe they truly are (and it's probably important to state here that I'm not a Royalist and I strongly question the relevance of any royal family in this day and age). Philip is the curmudgeonly old fart, rigidly locked into the attitudes and protocol of a bygone age, while Prince Charles is portrayed as a somewhat weak and vaguely pathetic character, allowing himself to be bullied to a degree by his mother while allying himself with Blair to ensure any fallout lands on her shoulders. He is also borderline paranoid about being shot by a sniper because of his unpopularity, apparently.<br/><br/>The film seems to both admire the idea of the monarchy (its passing symbolised by a stag with which the Queen comes to identify ¬ñ and which is shot, not by a prince, but by a commoner staying at a nearby commercial property), while neither praising its, admittedly reluctant, willingness to change or mourning its passing. As entertainment it is passable, and anyone who remembers those remarkable days after Diana's death will have their memories of that time revived, but as a dramatic account of actual events - I would have to say it is questionable in the extreme."

","As Britain's new prime minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) finds himself playing teacher to the monarch following Lady Diana's death. In The Queen starring Hellen Mirren, Blair values his Britishness as much as the queen does hers. If he hasn't inherit her privileges, he nonetheless has inherited the same sense of pride, and he brings it to his role as head of government. Unlike the Queen, however, he is in touch with the thinking of the British people and their love for Diana--or at least their idea of her.<br/><br/>Blair takes office in 1997 just before Princess (or not) Diana dies in a car crash in France with her lover. According to this movie, Blair is a PR pro, whose skills in this area save Queen Elizabeth's royal can following the death of the People's Princess--a moniker of his making.<br/><br/>Like any astute PR professional, Blair understands both his audience and the people to whom he answers. He never mistakes his propaganda for the reality--though he understands the right propaganda serves his interest, the Queen's interest, and the interest of the British people. Patriotism unites all three, yet each understands the homeland differently because each invokes different icons. The British people understand pop culture, of which Diana is the premier British icon; the Queen understands tradition, of which she is the central figure. Blair the pragmatist understands both.<br/><br/>The Queen shows a prime minister who understands the power of that great figment of the imagination, Diana, as a political force he could harness to his benefit. Blair understands that there are two Dianas--the one the Royals know and the one the ordinary people believe they know. He helps the Queen get over her intense dislike of a woman who treated her place in British society as a trifle and reunites her with her subjects without her ever losing her pride. Ironically, it takes a good while before the Royals come to realize that the British people love the idea of Diana--their feelings for whatever she is are heartfelt. The Royals just can't believe everyone doesn't loathe her. Their failure to see this costs them popular support for a while. This is the power of prejudice.<br/><br/>Blair speaks to his audience where they are and works all the players to his advantage. Everyone benefits--especially him. That's PR101. Watch and learn."
"marcin_kukuczka","7","1","2","8 July 2007"," For her Majesty and the Queenly Performance
","Having heard of the film's popularity among various people, I went to see it with many idealized expectations. I, first of all, highly respect Queen Elizabeth II who has been a symbol of modern royalty for me. I thought that the movie is about her since the title indicates it. Yet, what I saw was partly a documentary and partly an acted depiction of a few days in the queen's life in late summer of 1997. What happened those days is not necessary to explain: Diana called ""Peoples Princess"" died so tragically and unexpectedly; yet, many people and I were not aware that this time occurred so demanding, so requiring for the queen and the entire royal family.<br/><br/>Elizabeth cannot understand these days, whatever happens appears to be above any sort of modernizing proposed by the Prime Minister, above any sort of her belief in the British nation. The princess dies in a car crash and the whole country kneels down in the admiration of hers. But what about the royalty? What about the queen? ""They didn't deserve you"" as one condolence card for Diana says. In the view comes Tony Blair satirically called by his wife ""Mr savior of the monarchy"" who changes the queen's actions, who dares encourage her to publicly express sympathy for late Diana, to come back to London and to make the public statement as a queen and as a grandmother. Because otherwise...what would happen if the queen didn't listen? Indeed strange were the days when the QUEEN was to LISTEN...<br/><br/>This rather documentary content is even more noticeable thanks to archive news. Not only the focus is put on the newspaper headlines which also the queen reads, but on the real TV news. On the one hand, that clearly reflects the situation which Britain experienced then, the whole atmosphere of lament and grief; on the other hand, it may be quite disturbing for the viewer, particularly on the big screen. Mind you that the picture of archive news is very weak and contrasts seriously with the movie. Moreover, there is some wrong interpretation of important persons, including Queen Mother played by Sylvia Syms. However...<br/><br/>...after leaving the movie theater, I said to my friends that besides all possible flaws, I loved the film. And I think so till now. Yes I consider THE QUEEN really entertaining. It is 90% thanks to HELEN MIRREN:<br/><br/>She acts convincingly as a real professional expressing cold elegance, overwhelming splendor, typical calmness, unique intelligence that the Queen is famous for. It is, I think, right to say that Ms Mirren gives a QUEENLY PERFORMANCE throughout and considerably raises the value of the film. From the opening moment, when she sits in her formal clothes and talks ABOUT the new Prime Minister to the very final moment when she talks TO the Prime Minister after emotions have calmed down, Helen is ""royal"" in the role. This top notch performance of hers absolutely worth Oscar she won goes in pairs with many memorable moments.<br/><br/>I think that the most enchanting and at the same time most beautiful moment is the queen alone in the dreamlike landscape waiting to have her car repaired and...that lovely stag looking at her. The stag looks as if it wanted to say ""Don't give up, you are the queen of this beautiful country, you are our queen."" Unforgettable scene with stunning cinematography! Another moment that draws my attention is when the royal family visit the people mourning for Diana. How brilliant is Helen Mirren then and how lovely she expresses this restrain from emotions. The girl that gives the queen flowers appears to be a symbolic depiction of the entire nation that seemingly says to the queen: ""England forgives you, loves you too but...in a different way"" <br/><br/>All things considered, there were many portrayals of royalty from Greta Garbo who unforgettably portrayed Queen Christina through Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth I of England to Helen Mirren as Elizabeth II. This performance is surely one of those greatest ones. See THE QUEEN for the sake of her Majesty (if you are still ready to respect a monarch) and for the sake of Helen Mirren's portrayal. It's worth these 100 minutes. 7/10 for the movie since it is far from masterpiece but 10/10 for Helen Mirren who shows the real masterwork and modern classic!"

","Making a biopic is a tricky business. For one, you deal with a real-life personality and your job is to highlight the so-called 'good' qualities of the character while discreetly glossing over the so-called 'bad' qualities. While doing so, most of the biopics turn into a black and white affair, a story of extraordinary achievements of an ordinary person. It becomes trickier when you deal with a personality very much alive and kicking and attempt to tell a story, which the personality in question would rather wipe it out from the public memory, is she could. It is this aspect of film-making that makes The Queen stand out. You have to give it to director Stephen Frears and screenwriter Peter Morgan for dramatising the story which is very much part of the public memory and which involves the royal family of Great Britain. While doing so, both Morgan and Frears refuse to take a stand either to support or oppose what was happening. This is a rare achievement and one of the reasons what makes The Queen one of the outstanding movies released last year. The year was 1997. Tony Blair became the youngest Prime Minister of Britain and he promises to 'modernise' the conservative outlook of the country. Here begins the first clash between monarchy and democracy. Whatever he may do, Blair cannot undermine the royal family. Then occurs the tragic death of Princess Diana. As her body is flown from Paris to London, public expects a royal burial. Blair rides on the public support and terms Diana a people's princess. But Queen Elizabeth would hear anything about it. According to her, since Diana was no longer a member of the royal family (since her divorce) she cannot be given a royal burial. As public throng to Birmingham Palace to pay tribute to the late princess, the royal family goes for a holiday in Scotland. Here ensues the royal drama between the monarch and the democratic, modern prime minister. The queen stands by her decision while Blair would go to any extend to appease the public. The story is real. It happened exactly the same way in the week following Lady Diana's death. But what we knew was what the newspaper would tell us. The film is the behind the scenes events, how the royal family reacted at Diana's death. Most of us haven't seen the queen in her private life, and Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth takes us to a royal trip. Her body language, her voice modulation, her emotional outbursts all make us believe what Queen Elizabeth must have gone through those volatile days. Mirren adds such exuberance to here role that you cannot imagine any one else in that role. Last year Mirren took home all the major acting awards for the role, and she deserves every bit of it. She gives the character a rare dignity which otherwise could have been a crude caricature (like the character of Prince Charles, which ends up being a caricature.) Both Michael Sheen and Helen McCrory look uncannily like Tony and Cherie Blair respectively and lends to the authenticity of the drama. However, the highlight is Stephen Frears fearless directorial skills. He does not even attempt to positivise the actions of his characters and let the audience decide. And hence, through the film begins as a criticism to the royal family you end up supporting Queen Elizabeth for what she is. And for that the credit must go to Helen Mirren. She is the queen personified."
"middleburg","10","1","2","13 June 2007"," Tears for a beloved princess and an all-too-human queen
","The Queen is riveting. It is no simple film, but rather an absolutely fascinating glimpse behind closed doors: the massive closed doors shielding the British Royal Family in their opulent cocoon, the rather more plain doors of the media-driven British government and its movers and shakers, and the doors too often hiding or protecting all of us from the pain of real feelings, real emotions. But then these doors come tumbling down during that awful, shocking week, as visceral now as it was 10 years ago. The political manoeuvrings, the confusion about how to handle such an extraordinary public and private tragedy in the midst of an astonishing, but not necessarily surprising outpouring of national, indeed international grief is shown with razor sharp brilliance. It is a movie that is simply unforgettable. One can view the film from an historical perspective, and be completely intrigued at the way the events unfolded. But what makes the film so powerful are the emotions that one experiences. We remember the sadness of that week, and we get teary-eyed seeing the collective grief of the country one more time on the television screen. That beautiful, complex, extraordinary Diana - without realizing it was part of our dreams of ""happily ever after"". When there was no ""happily ever after"" - just the awesome finality of death, we cried - for her and also for ourselves. But in an amazing portrayal of the Queen in this movie, we now look at that week through Her eyes - not Diana's, not ours. Helen Mirren's performance is so unique, so exquisite, that we can't believe she's acting. She is a real person - regal, beautiful, elegant, down-to-earth, eccentric - a full human being. But as the turn of events unfold, her pain now becomes our pain - a pain that we didn't even realize was there. But of course it had to have been there! This movie makes us see that. When she almost becomes a little girl again, and calls out ""Mummy"" to the Queen Mother, seeking out her advice, desperate to be comforted, our hearts break. She is even more vulnerable than one could ever have imagined. At the end of the movie, everyone has been transformed - those historical characters are moving on as both duty and the human spirit dictates it must, but we have been transformed as well. We have cried all over again, but this time with a little more insight, a little more understanding and a little more wisdom."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","2","9 June 2007"," Insightful movie but lacks the proper emotions.
","An interesting viewpoint! I don't think anyone ever expected a movie to be made focusing on the Royal family during the events after the death of Princess Diana. As a matter of fact, I don't believe many people ever thought a movie would be made about Elizabeth II, at least not while she was still alive. In many ways this movie was a daring project. Also not in the least because it was about a delicate subject. The British Royal family is always a delicate subject but the death of Princess Diana is an all the more delicate subject, since it was an event that touched so many people all over the world because she was so loved everywhere. A daring project that payed off, judging by all the critical acclaim it received.<br/><br/>The British Royal family is perhaps one of the most inaccessible and distant still existing monarchies, since they rarely ever show their true emotions, which is mainly due to Elizabeth II, who always seems like an emotionally bland person with an always bland expression on her face. Tough for a movie to pick through this 'mask' to show the real humane side of the Royal family. This movie does attempt to do this by showing what happened behind the walls during the days after the fatal accident of Princess Diana in Paris. It provides an insightful view but we of course can only guess what truly went on behind the walls. It's viewpoint surely made this movie an interesting to watch but I don't feel that the movie always made the right choices with its storytelling.<br/><br/>I think this is one of those rare movies I wouldn't had mind seeing being 3 hours long. There is so much to tell, also about the characters and what they think and feel. Instead now the movie is even below 2 hours long that focuses on the entire Royal family and other key players. It has as a result that the queen and therefor also most of the movie its emotions gets pushed to the background at times, because of the many different other characters that are in the movie, with as a result that the Queen character still remains a sort of a mystery. I just don't feel that I now truly know who Elizabeth II is and what drives her and why she continues doing things the way she does. Yes, the movie created some more sympathy for her but I just wouldn't exactly considered it to be the ultimate resource about Elizabeth II.<br/><br/>The way the movie progresses is also rather predictable. The movie doesn't offer a lot of surprises, which is of course also due to the fact that the movie is based on true events. It makes the emotions and drama of the movie weaker, since it's too obvious how the movie is planned out and how it builds up to the inevitable ending. The movie only truly surprises with its characters. It was surprising to see that Prince Philip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) were even meaner, stiffer and old fashioned persons than the Queen herself. Especially Prince Philip was a surprise, since I only know him of TV, when he just walks behind the Queen and never does or says anything. When I was much younger I didn't even knew she still had an husband! I believe the first time I ever noticed him was during ""Party at the Palace: The Queen's Concerts, Buckingham Palace"" in 2002.<br/><br/>I've never been a big fan of using real archive footage in movies because it just never fully blends in with the rest of the movie and its atmosphere. This movie uses a lot of archive footage, from Princess Diana herself and of the people in the streets, giving their comments about the lack of response from the Royal family.<br/><br/>In the end the movie still becomes a bit too much of a respectful tribute to the royal family instead of an objective observation of the events. At least that's the feeling the ending gave me.<br/><br/>Aside from that all, the movie is a well made one. Stephen Frears is of course a competent director and he made the movie in the right atmosphere. Some of the sequences are really well constructed, which is also thanks to the fine cinematography and surprisingly good musical score.<br/><br/>Of course the movie would not had worked out at all of the actress playing the Queen didn't do her job right. With Oscar winner Helen Mirren you just can't go wrong. She really becomes the Queen in this movie and she even looks like her! Definitely true that her performance carries the movie. The rest of the cast doesn't really look like the real persons at all, which was a bit distracting. I mean I didn't ever saw Prince Philip, I just saw James Cromwell. And I didn't saw Prince Charles, I just saw a bloke trying to play Prince Charles. Michael Sheen also doesn't look much like Tony Blair, except in his last sequence, when his distinctive grin gets prominently shown. Nevertheless, through his fine acting, Martin Sheen is still highly credible in his role.<br/><br/>An interesting movie because of the point-view it is told from and a well made and good looking movie, that just isn't good enough with its drama and emotions and almost lets the story tell itself, which causes it to be rather predictable in how it unravels and builds up.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

When this movie came out I asked her if she had seen it and she said, ""No, I could never see it, it would bring back bad memories."" I did want to see it and rented it on DVD just to see Helen Mirren's Oscar winning performance. I would now have to tell my daughter and all others who loved Diana not to let sad memories keep you from this wonderful experience. The death itself was handled delicately. To witness the behind the scene frustration of the royal family in this time of crisis was the main story. Their not knowing how to handle the wave of grief coming from their subjects and others from around the world when they themselves held no grief for the woman who, in their minds, scandalized them. I thought Michael Sheen nearly stole the show as Tony Blair, both in appearance and voice. I had no idea that Tony Blair was so instrumental in getting the family to come around.

They have treated the background politics in what seems a very even-handed way. Really got me and my wife thinking about the some of the conversations and emotions that would have been taking place behind the scenes during the week of Diana's death.<br/><br/>This film does a fantastic job of making you think of the tremendous public & political forces that shaped peoples behaviour in that week of history ... and of the sort of ""background machinery"" that influences & effects public offices week-in and week-out.

","""The Queen"": Helen Mirren stars as Queen Elizabeth during the period just before, during, and after the death of ex-Princess Diana. This is a VERY focused film that does not veer off into studies of the other members of the royal family. If it looks at a second person with any depth, it's Tony Blair, who was new to the government. I found it interesting for the events of Diana's death, as seen through the eyes of Queen Elizabeth, to be compressed into 103 minutes, but I do not expect the ""newsworthiness"" aspect of this film will have ""legs"" into the future. One set of very interesting scenes revolve around a huge, elegant, 16-point stag on their ""country"" property. Elizabeth has two encounters with him. You initially think she reveals her ""humanity"" through him by responding to his beauty, but she sees herself AS him for other reasons¬Ö and, the second encounter does not offer her the fantasized elegance of the first. It's a very good symbol."
"lee_eisenberg","8","1","2","6 May 2007"," Now that they've made Queen Elizabeth look interesting, there comes an even more daunting task: convincing the world that the British monarchy has any reason to exist.
","Watching ""The Queen"" made me think several things. First and foremost was how Helen Mirren plays HM Queen Elizabeth II to a tee, getting her mannerisms and even her walk down (and you gotta admit, the two women look very similar). But another thing comes after you see what happened after Princess Diana's death, and how various topics crashed head on into each other. It seemed a little creepy to keep Harry and William from seeing their mother after she'd died. Of course, this could have resulted from the nearly tabloid response that followed her death.<br/><br/>Now admittedly, much of this movie is a possibility of what might have happened during those few days. But whether or not it is accurate is not the point. The purpose of this movie is to show that the United Kingdom's ruler is more than a staid old woman; she's a real human being, dealing with her own problems as much as just about anyone else has to.<br/><br/>As it was, watching the movie brought back memories of Diana's death. I remember that my parents and I were getting ready to go to my friend's bar mitzvah when we heard about the car wreck on the news and heard that Dodi Fayed had died. Everyone was talking about it at the bar mitzvah. When we got home, we turned on the news, and Diana had died. School started a day or two later and it was all that anyone was talking about for about the first week. For the next four years, I believed that it would be the defining moment of my formative years (like the Kennedy assassination for my parents); then, of course, September 11, 2001, came along.<br/><br/>I guess that the movie also brings up freedom of the press issues. Did the press cause Diana's death? Did they misrepresent her post mortem? These questions may persist, but I will still assert that the movie, while not the biggest masterpiece, is worth seeing as a look into the lives these individuals who so often seem so remote from the rest of the world. As it is, they make Prince Charles look like kind of a jerk. Also starring James Cromwell, Michael Sheen and Alex Jennings."

","The Queen Queen Elizabeth II, James Cromwell, Michael Sheen<br/><br/>First Class all the Way<br/><br/>Queen Elizabeth takes too long acknowledging Princess Diana's death in 1997 to the point some are talking about abolishing the monarchy in England. Oh, oh, this can't be good. <br/><br/>(Bob, you put Queen Elizabeth down as one of the actors) --Yeah, so? She did a good job-- (Yes, but Helen Mirren played the part of the Queen) --You sure? She was really believable, awfully good¬ó<br/><br/>Any time Inquiring minds can take a peek into the lives of the monarchy in England, we and the rest of the world are there. We want to see how the other half lives, the half that we can never be and have no real interest in becoming. We want to see how they break their bread at the table, what they consider when they dress themselves, and, yes, what they think of the rest of the world.<br/><br/>This movie could be considered embarrassing to the English monarchy. Why did the Royals wait so long to see they were making a huge mistake in not showing the proper timely grief in Diana's death? It could have cost them the monarchy had they not given in to Tony Blair's (Sheen) suggestions. We shall never know. But, could it be that they knew something we can never know for sure? Was the whole story told here? There are some reports that Diana was never in that car with Dodi Fayed and that it was someone else, a decoy. Okay, enough conspiracy.<br/><br/>After the Oscars for which Helen Mirren won the Award for Best Actress, she told one interviewer that she was to have a meeting with Queen Elizabeth. My question is who will emerge from that meeting to the point no one will notice who the real Queen is? Now, that would be a movie.<br/><br/>And, when they do meet I am sure they will laugh out loud together regarding Mrs. Blair's curtesy. It was described to the Queen as ""lame"" and when you see it and also see the Queen's reaction to it, you will laugh as I did. I am still laughing.<br/><br/>The whole production was first class. The performances by all were simply outstanding. <br/><br/>But, since we peered in, what other things did we learn about Queen Elizabeth? She was a mechanic after WWII; she keeps a diary; she drives vehicles around her property without security guards; she wears glasses that are too big for her face; she is called ""cabbage"" by Prince Phillip; and despite how she acts before her people, she is most loved and always forgiven. <br/><br/>Another thing I learned was that performances by the British about the British should have their own Oscar category. To put them in the same ring with US gangsters, cowboys, businessmen, etc, just doesn't do the British justice, but they will win almost every time. We don't stand a chance.<br/><br/>(So you liked the movie and Helen Mirren's performance?) --Yes, but are you sure Queen Elizabeth didn't play herself in this? Wonder what is in that diary?--<br/><br/>Violence: No, Sex:No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes, Mrs. Blair (Helen McCrory utters one F-bomb)"
"charchuk","8","1","2","22 February 2007"," Very well-made, but a bit shallow
","Exceptionally well-acted and well-written, though it ultimately feels a bit shallow. Perhaps it's because of the relatively short running time, but I felt the film never really expanded on the themes it was presenting. The story it tells is interesting enough, but it doesn't seem to have much resonance. That said, I found the inside look at the royal family quite enlightening, though I'm doubtful as to the authenticity, and I liked the fact that this was history that I actually was familiar with. Mirren gives a layered, effective performance, as does Michael Sheen - though he grinned a bit too much - and I really found no weak links in the cast. The script is smart and witty, and the score is quite excellent as well. Very well-made, though it didn't have a great impact on me."
"jpschapira","8","1","2","21 February 2007"," Another level of everything
","We know, when we're watching a movie about true events, that we are witnessing the lives of people who existed and did things. In politics, we see recognized persons doing good or bad for their community. I have come to like biographical films (in the end, telling someone's life is a biography), without caring which period of the person's existence it is showing.<br/><br/>Stephen Frears' ""The Queen"" is another level of biography, however, because it is about something that happened only ten years ago. It is about the Queen Elizabeth of England, and about her discussion with Prime Minister Tony Blair to decide if Princess Diana should have had a private funeral or a public one for everyone to see.<br/><br/>Of course, each one of the parties had his beliefs about the matter. It was acknowledged that Elizabeth wasn't fond of Diana, but she was a massively popular phenomenon. I mean, my mother loved her and she doesn't even live in England. ""It's her family decision to do a private funeral and since she was no longer a member of the Royal Family I can't intervene"", the Queen says to Tony Blair, a young and intelligent man who wanted to change the classic monarchic rules. ""Wouldn't you say that given her popularity Diana should have a funeral in which many people can take part?"", Blair replies the Queen.<br/><br/>With respect he treated her; I imagine he still does. Because don't forget that ""The Queen"" shows personalities that are still alive and doing their jobs today; which is fairly risky. Peter Morgan wrote a screenplay commencing from the facts and took it deep inside the Windsor and the Buckingham Palace, right to the Queen's bedroom and even to the Prime Minister's family house. Morgan deals with grief in every possible way.<br/><br/>Prince Charles' grief for loosing the mother of his children; the Royal Family's grief, between acceptance and resignation for the troubles Diana caused them; the people's grief for all that Diana did for them and the children; and the Queen's silent grief. She went off by herself to the countryside and stayed quiet, thinking. Her majesty alone, dealing with her pain. Here, Frears understands that he needs to analyze his main character in every possible way; so he does and Affonso Beato's cinematography gets the mood perfectly. The cinematographers of the Best Picture Nominees were definitely overlooked this year: ""Babel"" looks beautiful; ""Little Miss Sunshine"" looks so lucid; ""The Departed"" choices are the right ones...Luckily, the nominations are not simple works; I'm going for ""The Prestige"".<br/><br/>""The Queen"" is also about loneliness in the most difficult times and about two very different individuals (Elizabeth and Tony Blair) who, probably, admired each other in silence. These two characters and the actors who play them sustain the picture; even when James Cromwell portrays an accurate Phillip and Alex Jennings makes Prince Charles as laughable as in real life. We could also say that the actors are helped big time by the press and the images of the news that covered Diana's death all over the world (put together by Lucia Zucchetti's masterful edition).<br/><br/>Tony Blair is played by Michael Sheen with a lot of personal strength and determination that leave him at the character turn of his career. I hope to see good things from him in the near future. What I can say about Helen Mirren is that the Oscar she's going to win, besides her acting skills, is because of the courage it takes to play a character of this magnitude; an emblematic figure that can easily watch what the actress has done. Her work is dignifying; beyond admiration.<br/><br/>There's a lot more to be said about ""The Queen""¬ÖLet's just leave it at: ""Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown""."

","Watching the movie keeps you wondering what is really going on in the mind of some people.

No matter what you may think about a monarchy (I am glad we have a completely different monarchy in the Netherlands), if you simply look at the way this movie is made, the high level of acting, cinema-photography, make-up, music, editing, it is a masterpiece that rarely comes from Hollywood.

","Helen Mirren will certainly deserve her Oscar next month. (Do you think the members of the Acadamy would dare snub the queen?) However without a doubt the real star of this fine movie is Diana Spencer. After wining the princess role by marrying Prince Charles, she never failed to upstage the royals at every turn and she manages to pull it off again in this movie. The whole point of the movie is to show how they agonize and struggle to deal with her -- even in death. It is truly a fascinating glimpse into the workings of the royal family.<br/><br/>For a thousand years, we (And let's not kid ourselves, Elizabeth is as much our queen as England's in spite of two hundred and thirty years official separation since the American Revolution.) have, in turns, revered and disliked the monarchy. We don't really understand them. The English don't understand them, and, in realty, they scarcely understand themselves. The one thing they have proved to be, over the many centuries they have been in place, is resilient. They are capable of evolving, be it at an ever so glacial pace. We leave the movie with a slightly better understanding of what it means to be Queen. The queen will overcome and survive without a doubt!<br/><br/>This movie captures exquisitely one of those evolution episodes. Excellently scripted, filmed, staged, conceived and produced. Kudos to all involved. Truly deserving of ""best picture"" they will surely get if the Acadamy can, for once, leave political correctness out of it."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","1","2","19 February 2007"," High-brow English humour and heart that subtly treads on the tragedy at hand
","From the unsurpassed deconstruction of social class by Stephen Frears comes a prudent slice of royal British history, spanning across little more than a week of events. The death of the ""People's Princess"" Diana hedges the story with the ill malaise of the people turned scornfully against the Queen and her family for not grieving or acknowledging the tragedy.<br/><br/>The thematic conflict takes place between the obsolete old school (the Royal Family) inside the walls of Buckingham Palace and the reformist new school (newly-elected Tony Blair and the Labour Party) at 10 Downing Street, hovering between the two polarized households with stately direction. There is a point of hair-dresser gossiping tendencies in enjoying a film like ""The Queen"" as a candy box of intrigue is waiting to be unwrapped behind the closes walls of the monarchy, but Frears makes the content accessible to all.<br/><br/>Of course, ""The Queen"" as a person and film are not wholly grounded in reality; ""Last King of Scotland"" screenwriter Peter Morgan has scripted a fiction-based account of the dialogue and relations that took place in 1997, but an admirably reasonable take it is. Reality ties are not completely severed, and Stephen Frears makes the decision to further ground his film with newsreel footage interjected at common intervals and majestic steadicam shots that seems to aptly snap up the stately atmosphere of Buckingham Palace.<br/><br/>But ""The Queen"" is undeniably a custom-tailored vehicle for Helen Mirren who captures the complex nature of the titular character with stoic, dignified, purse-lipped composure. The staunch refusal to publicly speak about the event of Diana's death¬ónor allow for a civic funeral, nor fly the throne's flags at half-mast all alienated her immensely from her people, even though she was one of the people who grieved the most. Needless to say, this is a challenging role to inhabit, but Mirren is superb in all of her conflicted sorrow. The sum of her performance is all the little stoic details, the suppressed emotions she bottles up with a lid but which sometimes bubble up and how natural she makes ""staged"" appear.<br/><br/>It is in a way a pity that Helen Mirren's fine performance casts such a wide-ranging shadow over the rest of the cast. The film on its own may be rather lovely, but the key figure who emerges most prominently and most nobly is undoubtedly Tony Blair as portrayed by Michael Sheen, and who regrettably received next to no buzz. The fact is that Sheen is just as credible as Mirren in his own right, creating a layered and conflicted young Prime Minister with pending allegiances. Stephen Frears will always remain an actors' director and as a result the success of ""The Queen"" rests squarely on the apt shoulders of its cast. It's delightedly humorous in tone, practicing an unmistakable high-brow British comedy that subtly treads on the tragedy at hand.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","The Great Hellen Mirren HRH who I enjoyed in Prime Suspect does it well again. I happen to remember that summer of 1997 and the movie does remind us of the Diana Tragedy. But it is pin-pointed to that period only. My late Mother used to say that EIIR has more family Problems than ours. Maybe the Movie Diana has still to be made. If you did not remember that period the movie does little help. Also the subject of the Impact of the Media and Modern Telecom on Politics is a subject we live with every day. I remember that weekend when we were busy with other tragedies, (Lebanon, Suicide Bombers etc..). In this part of the World we ask What is going to take up the Headlines? Iraq? Darfur forgotten? Diana did not use a seat belt and they were trying, again, to get away from Paparachi. I see this a the universal subject of this well done movie."
"largelyhappy","10","1","2","9 February 2007"," Different Lives
","Goes without saying that Helen Mirren was THE star here.<br/><br/>Never was there better proof that the Royals live in a totally different and insulated world from the rest of us. ""I find all problems can be solved after a long walk."" Tells you she has no idea what real life or problems are like. Real people don't have problems that can be solved by a walk.<br/><br/>Prince Phillip's answer to two little boys grief at the death of their beloved mother (something he cannot understand) is ""cured"" by taking them out walking. Good grief!<br/><br/>The Queen and her family have been brought up to observe a rigid set of rules which simply do not apply to ordinary people. Thus, when you or I would mourn, or love or show sympathy, Elizabeth et al are not allowed this luxury and simply don't know how to feel, so repressed have they been all their lives.<br/><br/>The Monarch, as some people already know, is given lessons on how not to cough, cry, sneeze, break wind or show any emotion in public. (So common dear) Such rigid adherence to unnatural rules is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to protocol. So Diana, who didn't grow up in that world and wanted to show her love and fear and betrayal, was anathema from the beginning. The Royals manipulated their son into a loveless marriage with a suitable girl - and everyone paid the price.<br/><br/>'The Queen' explains all this without ever saying so in words and the impact is stunning.<br/><br/>I am an anti-royalist but even I couldn't blame Elizabeth for wanting it all to go her way, after all, that's how she's lived for 80 years, how could she change?<br/><br/>That she had to climb down and give in to the pressure from the tabloids must have hit hard and Helen Mirren perfectly portrays this controlled and bitter anger at being beaten. No one tells the Queen what to do, not even her PM, and here were some horribly common people forcing her to fly a flag, give in to a royal funeral and more. <br/><br/>I bet she still has nightmares about it! <br/><br/>Thank goodness the day are gone when a monarch could say 'Off with his head'. Blair wouldn't have lasted long.<br/><br/>A superb film with a million hidden hints and subtle suggestions which most British people would pick up.

I heard on CBS Good Morning America that the Queen herself commented, "" The Queen starred in a movie about Helen Mirren!"" which just goes to show she thought Helen portryed herself beautifully. It probably did not improve her husband's popularity though and it showed her son to be a little bit of a wimp when it came to standing up to her decisions during the death of his ex-wife. I would definitely recommmed this movie and hope it wins an award at the Academy Awards."
"majikstl","8","1","2","4 February 2007"," Old Dinosaurs Learning New Tricks ...
","I have to admit that I never quite got that whole Princess Diana thing -- the awe that she inspired, and still does. I didn't hate her or anything, but I remember shortly before her infamous death I saw her on the cover of a magazine and I thought to myself ""Is there anyone on earth who should be of less interest?"" <br/><br/>Okay, she did the Cinderella bit and married into a royal family only to find the ""happily ever after"" myth didn't quite pan out. A bad marriage, disapproving in-laws and a messy divorce and what did she get out of it? Untold wealth, immense fame and adoration, jet set friends and she even got to keep the royal title. Not a bad haul, I'd say. The self-pitying poor little rich girl image just didn't move me. And when she died, the whole world seemed to go into a state of frozen shock in a way that hadn't been seen since JFK was assassinated. And as the world mourned, I scratched my head in confusion.<br/><br/>All of this is a way of me getting around to saying that going into THE QUEEN, I was more than little bit sympathetic to the royal family. The film deals with how Queen Elizabeth faced an unexpected public relations nightmare upon Diana's death and while I can't say that I was any more enamoured by the Royals than I was with Diana, I appreciate their predicament. The Golden Girl to the rest of the world was at best an ex-in-law to The Royals and at worst a disgruntled ex-employee of Her Majesty Inc. Not only did Diana seem inappreciative of all that being part of the monarchy had given her, she showed little restraint in bucking royal protocol by complaining to the press. And just when Elizabeth thought she was more or less rid of her, the so-called ""People's Princess"" proves she can upstage the monarchy in death just as effectively as in life.<br/><br/>In a wonderfully understated performance, Helen Mirren plays the Queen with an unpretentious, down-to-earth -- if a bit joyless -- directness. There is neither a trace of condescension nor satire in her approach and she invests a surprising amount of compassion in a character who is strangely lacking in passion. Her Elizabeth II wears the burden of power almost defiantly, as if she has to prove that she can, despite half a century of proof that she is up to the chore. All she expects is that everybody play by the rules, including herself -- never mind whether the rules are fair or make sense. Thus, when faced with the expectations that the rules be revised, once again, to accommodate Diana, she is not amused -- or even understanding.<br/><br/>What the Queen never seems to grasp is that Diana was modern-day royalty -- not part of an arcane line of inherited sovereignty, but someone who is famous for being famous. A celebrity. Though the Queen claims her status as divine privilege, Diana out ranked her; her acclaim anointed by the masses, via the media. What THE QUEEN makes clear is that while the royal family really should be commended for not exploiting Diana's tragedy with insincere grief, they really had no choice but to become part of the world-wide sob-fest. However inexplicable or undeserved Diana's notoriety might have been, it was too potent to ignore.<br/><br/>That is where Prime Minister Tony Blair comes in. Though recognizing that the monarchy is a dinosaur, Blair realizes that just having a dinosaur is something unique. And the care and feeding of a dinosaur is a delicate chore. Despite the subject matter, THE QUEEN is largely a comedy of manners, a droll and understated examination of how Blair coaxes Queen and Co. to adapt to the times in an effort to avoid extinction. Grudgingly, indignantly, Elizabeth deigns to allow Diana the royal treatment one last time. But, while public opinion may make the Queen mourn, nobody can make her cry.<br/><br/>Despite Mirren's wonderfully dour performance, THE QUEEN is hardly a one-woman show. As Blair, Michael Sheen gives a lively and humorous performance as a man who also must adapt, evolving from someone opposed to the monarchy to one who passionately must defend the royal family and all that it entails. And James Cromwell is all impotent bluster as the perpetually outraged Prince Phillip. But curiously the most sympathetic character is Prince Charles, played by Alex Jennings; caught between two powerful and self-centered women, Charles ends up being a minor character in the film, just as he has become in reality.<br/><br/>In the end, THE QUEEN knocks the royal family off the throne, but not in a cruel or radical way. Perhaps what made Diana so popular was that she seemed human, a trait either bred out of those born to the monarchy or a trait that they had been carefully trained to hide. Either way, I left the movie liking the royal family just a little better -- except for Diana, who I still just don't get."

","I enjoyed the film The Queen. I have always found the image of the Queen reassuringly consistent and Helen Mirren's portrayal was true to this image. My favourite scene was where she breaks down in her land-rover and sees the noble stag which Prince Philip and the boys are hunting and attempts to scare it away, so they will not kill it. Later she hears from Prince Philip the stag has been killed on a neighbouring estate. When she sees its fine head in the rotunda cold room on the neighbouring estate and its carcass hanging up, she asks who killed it. The reply ""a City of London financier"" speaks volumes. Times have changed. Time was, when only the monarch could kill a royal beast like that. But the tradition of the Queen having to ask permission to enter the City of London is still in place and she still does not have power there. But boffins from the City can kill royal beasts. She must accept this and take her (for me) reassuring image to London to remind the many mourners for Diana she is still there for all of them. Which she does and it is beautifully portrayed by HM (interesting initials for the part those, it never occurred to me before). The Queen never loses her integrity and dignity in doing this. Money may be able to buy royal-type privileges, but it cannot buy integrity and dignity. In this scene, and in many other scenes in this film, this message came over to me. I thought it well thought out and well written for this reason."
"colonel_green","9","1","2","28 January 2007"," A compelling, low-key film for adults.
","Diana, Princess of Wales' life and death were both fodder for sensationalist tabloids and newspapers, as well as a rather unique event in the 1990s; a singular outpouring of national, even global, grief for an 'ex-HRH' who became a media princess. This film, made by the reliable director Stephen Frears, follows the British Royal family in the week between Diana's death and her funeral. Helen Mirren, essaying her third British Queen (well, two Queens and a Queen-consort), plays Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and a score or so other nations for over fifty years.<br/><br/>I have always been an advocate for the Canadian Monarchy (a thousand dead Irish-Catholic relatives scattered along the Boyne roll over in their graves), in support of a traditional establishment that has served our country well over the years; I've always greatly admired the Queen's dedication to duty and dignified execution of her office. Mirren portrays her as a concerned, professional woman who finds that the England of her father, George VI, has changed under her feet, and she may not be able to judge the mood anymore. Tony Blair, played by Michael Sheen, attempts to transition the Crown to a more modern role, while fending off barbs from his disrespectful subordinates.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot of plot here, but it is a terrific character study of the Queen and the Prime Minister. Mirren and Sheen are excellent, and each is physically a dead-ringer for their subject. Other actors, such as Sylvia Syms (the Queen Mum), James Cromwell (Prince Phillip), and Alex Jennings (Prince Charles) are not as physically similar, but are also strong in their parts; Syms is a delightful comic, and she and Cromwell get most of the best lines (there's a good deal of humour, the dry and educated variety, to be found here). Mirren's performance has been deservedly praised, but it is a shame that Sheen's work has fallen by the wayside; he deserved a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>A decades after Diana's death, the fears for the future of the monarchy have not come to pass; Elizabeth II is still widely admired, and more popular than ever, and she can hopefully surpass Queen Victoria as England's longest-serving monarch. God save the Queen."
"grendelkhan","10","1","2","27 January 2007"," Excellent film!
","The Queen is a masterful piece of cinema. The performances are true examples of character work, with Helen Mirren and Micheal Sheen transforming themselves into Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair. As I watched the film, I forgot I was watching the same actress who played Jane Tennison and Morgan Le Faye, and felt like I was watching the actual Queen. I have always enjoyed Mirren's work, but she really produced a masterpiece here.<br/><br/>The film really captures the events of the time, but gives them a new, human perspective. at the time, as an American, I felt the whole thing was a rather gross spectacle; but, you get a different perspective here. Director Frears skillfully blends archival footage with filmed scenes, allowing you to see behind the news footage. You come to understand the Queen and prince Charles' perspectives more. It's also amazing to watch Sheen as Blair. He is elected as a modernizer, someone who would seem to want to do away with the anachronism of the monarchy; yet he seems to fall under the spell after he meets the Queen, one-on-one. He comes to understand her perspective, the role she plays, and the events that shaped her life and character.<br/><br/>At times, I watched the film and again wondered why the British put up with this institution and the insanity that seems to surround it; but then I realize that Americans do the same thing, with politicians, celebrities and sports figures. They cease to be people to us and become icons. The monarch represents the living history of Britain. It's a fascinating idea that the film captures well.<br/><br/>The film is one of the best I have seen in some years and Mirren has won every accolade. As of this writing, it appears that the announcement of her Oscar is the surest bet since the outcome of Rocky 2, and deservedly so. Mirren pulls off a true piece of character acting; she literally becomes the Queen. Michael Sheen deserved an equal nomination for his portrayal of Blair, but was snubbed. The rest of the cast acquit themselves with considerable skill, as well; with Helen McCrory getting some of the best lines and scenes, as Cherie Blair.<br/><br/>The film has many fine moments and draws real emotion from the audience. For me, the most moving scene is when the Royal Family are outside Buckingham Palace, viewing the the mound of flowers and cards. Mirren's reactions give you a sense of how Queen Elizabeth must have truly felt. The moment that she asks the little girl if she wants her to place her flowers with the others, and the girl says ""..no, these are for you,"" brought tears to my eyes. Mirren is so visibly touched by such a small but honest expression. it is not manipulated, but emerges from truth, the best form of drama.<br/><br/>This is a film and a performance that is worth seeing and studying, particularly for an aspiring actor."

","The film is a wise rumination on the pitfalls of leadership -- on how the fickle mob turns, eventually, on all rulers and makes them dance a different step than the one they want to dance. Mirren is perfect as she shows us how the queen, at first, fails to understand the psychology of the masses, and then proceeds through dawning realization and reluctant compliance.<br/><br/>Nicely balanced, the movie is fair to all involved, with the exception of Prince Philip (who is much more jovial and joke-loving than he is portrayed here).<br/><br/>The Queen is full of brilliant vignettes that underline the central theme; for example, in one scene Elizabeth commiserates with a slain stag who seems to foreshadow for her the coming extinction of the monarchy.<br/><br/>All in all, a superior film one may profitably digest for weeks and months afterwards."

There is one brief moment in this lovely film; a simple gesture, which has such beauty and emotion that it actually takes your breath away. A ""breathtaking"" moment. However brief, this moment speaks volumes and offers an example of humanity which we are supposed to find in another film this year, 'Children of Men.' Trust me, 'The Queen' is a film with heart and its very essence is about humanity and compassion.

","It's reassuring to see an actress of Helen Mirren's caliber finally receiving the top-line recognition she deserves for a role that must have been challenging to tackle without sinking into parody as others before her have. As Queen Elizabeth II, she manages to convey the immaculate decorum of her real-life counterpart without sacrificing the humanism essential in empathizing with her during a trying time. The period in question is the week that felt like an eternity after the death of Princess Diana in 1997 when the world was awaiting an official response from the Queen. With just a wig and glasses to alter her appearance, Mirren is superb in a role that must have been quite constraining given that the subject is not only still the reigning monarch but the model of blank-faced self-possession. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears in a surprisingly dishy manner, the film actually plays out as a witty comedy of manners beset by a tragic event.<br/><br/>The 2006 film chronicles that momentous week and prefaces it with Tony Blair's first formal introduction to the Queen in May 1997 after his election as the first Labour Party Prime Minister in nearly two decades. Elizabeth's concerns over Blair's promises of modernity are expressed in small gestures, but obviously their values-based clash come to the fore when Diana is killed in a Paris car accident six months later. Cloistered at the time in their Scottish estate, Balmoral, the royal family does not support a public memorial for Diana since she had divorced Charles the previous year. However, public outcry over their seeming aloofness reaches a level of frenzy that places Blair in the difficult spot of requesting the Queen to speak to her subjects about what she considers a private matter. Exacerbating the situation is the residual animosity that the royal family feels toward Diana, whom they feel had betrayed them in the media.<br/><br/>While the story is fact-based, one can't help but believe the private moments are played with a certain amount of exaggerated tabloid-friendly bias, especially the frequently cutting swipes at Diana and the rather fanciful episode with the stag. It makes for some of the film's more entertaining moments, but concurrently they undermine the credibility of the account. Beyond Mirren, there is superbly comic work from James Cromwell as a blustery, unsympathetic Prince Philip; Alex Jennings as a grieving but oddly vacant and paranoid Prince Charles; Helen McCrory as Blair's curtsey-challenged, tough-minded wife Cherie; and Sylvia Syms (not the jazz singer) as the still-alert, eye-rolling Queen Mother. Initially, Michael Sheen looks like he will do a zealous parody of the real Blair, but he gains respectable gravity as the story progresses. Above all else, the film is a personal triumph for Mirren's stellar work in what may turn out to be the role of a lifetime."

","This is the very subtle and nuanced story told in an understated way, of how, immediately after the August 1997 death of ex-HRH Princess Diana as a result of a car accident in Paris, the Queen (Helen Mirren, brilliant) and Royal household were prodded into embracing the nation's grief by both public opinion and the recently elected Tony Blair (Michael Sheen). It's a fairly slight basis for a story but Stephen Frears manages to keep us interested by presenting it as a tussle between the Queen, who believes duty must come first and grief should be private, and Blair, who has to appease the tabloids and accommodate the people's grief. It's a tricky business putting lines into the mouths of actors playing living celebrities, given British (and Australian) libel laws and I can only recall one previous occasion where the Queen has been so portrayed, by Prunella Scales in Alan Bennett's brilliant play about the traitor Anthony Blunt ""A Question of Attribution"". Interestingly in France, which also has tough (pro plaintiff) libel laws, it is possible to put a real person into a novel and have them act badly without that constituting defamation, as long as it is clear the conduct is fictional.<br/><br/>The Queen is not likely to sue, but she does not come out of this film too badly. She is shown as being perhaps more sympathetic to animals than people, but nevertheless high - principled and flexible enough to change her position to protect her interest, the standing of the monarchy. The same cannot be said for the Duke, portrayed here by the American actor James Cornwell as a grumpy hidebound stupid conservative, and the Queen Mum (Sylvia Syms), who seems to be living (just) in another century. Tony Blair too, does not come out so badly, at least if you accept it's OK for him to start out as a radical critic of the monarchy and wind up supporting it, much to the disgust of his wife Cherie (Helen McCroy, excellent). The person who really ought to sue is his press secretary Alistair Campbell who is portrayed very convincingly by Mark Bazeley as an enthusiastic amoral prat who will do anything to improve the PM's press coverage.<br/><br/>The settings are appropriately sumptuous, including it seems some in Buckingham Palace, though Balmoral, where most of the action takes place was apparently off-limits and the film was shot in several other Scottish Highlands locations. I must admit the royal lifestyle ¬ñ huge palaces, dozens of servants, every last detail of royal activities organized in advance, protocols for everything - would soon engender a certain remoteness of attitude, and it's a wonder the Queen is in touch with ordinary life as much as she is. From an Australian perspective however this film demonstrates that the British monarchy is something we need to put behind us ¬ñ we still have it only because John Howard, our unprincipled and rat-cunning Prime minister who is still emotionally attached to it, managed to split the pro-republican vote at the 1999 referendum between those who wanted a directly elected president and those who were happy for the politicians to appoint one. Whatever value, spiritual and practical, the British see in their monarchy has no relevance here, and twenty years should see an end to it. In the meantime we can be entertained by perceptive, if not gripping drama such as this."

","In my quest in searching for good movies running in Amsterdam, I selected this new movie that is critically acclaimed and appreciated by all.<br/><br/>I saw this movie at Pathe Tunishchi Theater.<br/><br/>When the movie started and about after 30 minutes later I was trying to rate this movie ¬ñ I gave it 4 Stars out of 10. The reason was because I found the movie too shallow ¬ñ too current. It showed 2 characters of recent times ¬ñ The Queen of England and the President of UK ¬ñ Tony Blair. For me, it seemed comical, to make movie on recent living characters. Because it had all the chances of mis-representing thoughts and events ¬ñ that would not have been interpreted in the way the Director has shown us. In the beginning 30 minutes or so ¬ñ the director was trying to take a shot at making the laughing stock of the Queen's monarchy and their ways of life. The character of Queen, the King, Prince Charles and Tony Blair ¬ñ seemed to me quite caricatured ¬ñ almost like comic strip. I was not at all impressed by the first part of the movie.<br/><br/>But the movie started to grip me ¬ñ as it progressed. Michael Sheen has acted fantastically as Tony Blair. But the stealer of the show was Helen Mirren, who put her heart and soul in portraying the emotional turmoil the Queen faces. The pride and arrogance and the humiliation and sadness, was projected with royal touch of smile, poise and confidence by Helen. She may surely bag this years top actress Awards at various awards ceremonies.<br/><br/>The movie shows how the media ¬ñ after Diana's death ¬ñ projects the Royal family as villains ¬ñ and creates public pressure on the royal family to react to Diana ¬ñ who no longer is part of their Royal family. Traditionally they need not react ¬ñ but in today's changing world it is the job of Tony Blair ¬ñ who is People's Voice ¬ñ to make the Queen understand what to do to survive in respect of people's memory. The Queen goes through waves of emotional humiliation reflected brilliantly by Helen by her subdued eyes and emotions.<br/><br/>The best scene that I like and would love to remember is the scene when the Queen's Jeep's axel is broken and is in the midst of no-where in her 400 acres of Palace area, and encounters a Royal Stag ¬ñ who is being driven and chased to be hunted by her own grand sons ¬ñ sons of Prince Charles and Diana. She sees her suffering in the Royal Stag. And the killing of Royal stag reflects the director's vision of killing of all the Royalty that was left of the Queen. The poignant scene was very delicately handled when the Queen on hearing the killing of Royal Stag wants to go and pay her last tribute to it. The decorum with which Helen has handled that scene is brilliant.<br/><br/>And thus, by the end of the movie ¬ñ I change my rating."

","""The Queen"" is all-together remarkable not only for what it is but for what it isn't.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Frears' film of Peter Morgan's script explores the relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and British Prime Minister Tony Blair during the summer of 1997, when Blair arrived in office and Diana, the former Princess of Wales, died in a car accident in Paris.<br/><br/>It imagines what life was like at Balmoral, the Royal Family's estate in Scotland, and at 10 Downing St., the Prime Minister's home and office, during that unforgettable week when seemingly all the world, and surely all of Britain, found itself in mourning for a dazzling young woman of so many striking qualities and contradictions. It takes a handful of living, non-fictional characters -- the queen, Blair, princes Philip and Charles, Blair's wife and various aides to all parties -- and attributes words, thoughts, actions and emotions to them. And it does so without ever stooping to parody, shorthand or even received wisdom. Almost everyone in the film is granted full-blooded human depth, and the result is a deeply satisfying drama.<br/><br/>""The Queen"" is also quite funny and, at turns, moving. Frears and Morgan -- who collaborated in 2003 on ""The Deal,"" a TV movie about Blair's Machiavellian rise to power -- have wonderful antennae for little telling details, contrasts and absurdities. They juxtapose the timid, always-on-tip-toes staff of the queen with Blair's gung-ho American-style team. They balance the grand pomp and luxury of Her Majesty's daily world with the house-full-of-kids life of the Blairs, where fish-stick dinners and crayoned walls are the norm. And they make their film really special by showing us the ways in which the queen comes to recognize Blair's talents, especially his sense of public mood, just as he finds himself praising her qualities of honor, strength and grace when his aides and wife jeer at the very thought of her.<br/><br/>It's a film that shows us Prince Charles crying, Elizabeth swearing, corgi dogs frolicking and the Blairs fumbling in matters of royal protocol and yet treats none of it in a campy or satiric manner. The remarkably versatile Frears (""My Beautiful Laundrette,"" ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" ""The Grifters,"" ""High Fidelity,"" ""Dirty Pretty Things"") once again blends comedy, drama and something like social reportage to convince you utterly of what you're watching. The more you know about contemporary British politics, the more credible the film feels, which is a heck of a trick, but it's smashing entertainment as a story, and it's studded with memorable bits.<br/><br/>Most of those have to do with Helen Mirren, a splendid actress at something very near the top of her craft in the title role. From the opening credits, when she fixes the audience with a gaze that is at once open and opaque, Mirren's Elizabeth is the unhidden yet unknowable center of the film. But she is no trope or symbol. Through her diplomatic tussles with Blair, her rustic Highlands romps, her firm dealings with her frustrated son and opinionated husband, her quiet colloquies with her shrewd mother, and her gradual recognition that her stolid response to Diana's death has pained her subjects, Mirren plays an otherworldly woman in a fashion that's palpably real and human. It's a dignified, intelligent, tasteful and, most of all, living depiction. (Mirren won an Emmy this summer for playing the title character of the mini-series ""Elizabeth I,"" and right now she's a good bet to win the Oscar in February -- a mighty big pot to win with a pair of queens.) Equally fine is Michael Sheen as Blair (reprising the role from ""The Deal,"" in fact). There's a sense of an impression in the portrayal (Blair's manner of speech is more slippery, befitting the man), but Sheen gives us immediate access to his ambition, confidence and cunning. Members of the royal family react to Diana's death by shutting themselves up and offering neither word nor gesture to a public that was inundating the royal palaces with funereal mountains of flowers. But Blair negotiates with the queen to coax her into a more human and politically expedient posture. Watching Sheen, you're absolutely convinced that he can pull the delicate trick.<br/><br/>Frears presents other notable performances: Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother, Alex Jennings as Prince Charles, Roger Allam as the queen's chief aide and Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair. The one sour note is the estimable James Cromwell, whose Prince Philip is neither written nor cast credibly, a one-note Johnny who almost always rings false.<br/><br/>Or, rather, he rings as you may have feared they all might. Face it: You go into ""The Queen"" expecting something like Kitty Kelley or ""The Osbournes."" But what you get is a film of nearly Shakespearean political, social and personal complexities, made with assured wit and craft. Lord knows Elizabeth will likely never see it. But it truly is worthy of a queen."

","Wow, what a film. What a challenge in the first place. There's so little margin for error in mimicry, especially mimicry of the royal family; so many attempts in the past have been instantly tawdry. The brilliance of Helen Mirren is that she is so convincing; her mannerisms, expression and posture appear to be so consistent and accurate that you believe 'this is how the Queen must be'. I say 'appear to be', because the curious thing is that we all assume we know the Queen intimately enough to 'recognise' the mannerisms, to be able to say at the slightest wince or purse of the lips or reflective raising of the brow 'wow, that was spot-on'. Do any of us really know the Queen that well from what we've seen of her? Perhaps we do. But perhaps it is Mirren's confidence and consistency that makes her mimicry work. At the start of the movie, when she pulls herself up and changes her glance with a slight throaty chuckle, Mirren masterfully captures a character that we recognise as the Queen, without uttering a single word; we can almost sense what she was day-dreaming about. For me, that was extraordinary; it said so much about the depth of the portrayal and the character we seem to 'know' as the Queen. This, before any words were uttered at all. <br/><br/>The danger, of course, is that the portrayal is so convincing we tend to think not just 'that's how the Queen is', but 'that's how it must have been'. We need to remind ourselves that the film is only fiction based on assumptions of character and interpretations of events. Then again, maybe the fact that we need to do this is one of the film's triumphs."

Equally fascinating and astonishing by reel 3, it does take a good half hour for one to get used to the pantomime happening with gradual credibility before your very wide open eyes. Initially it looked like a farce when University students get dressed up as old age pensioners. Prince Charles looked like a silent screen star without the pancake makeup. Within 40 minutes, this well crafted and very sly comedy has convinced you that you are actually peering into the Monachy during private days and fussy querulous nights. A great plot device to sincerely help us understand the Queen's feelings and her cementing over them once revealed involves a mighty Reindeer Stag. Well done. It was Mirren's Oscar moment by the creek... and if you see this film you will instantly know what I mean. Brutally satiric concerning both The Duke and Cherie Blair both hilariously pungently observed. What a production... cold color and fog. Just like the Monarchy. The intense sadness that wells again upon seeing the news shots of Diana and the sea of flowers as well as other well edited news footage is superbly presented for maximum effect (on me anyway).

","I always read the negative reviews on IMDb first. I do this because, sometimes, in my mind, I have a very ""blinder view"" of a film and like to hear the opposing view...or, I like to commiserate exactly what I felt was lacking.<br/><br/>In this case, I'm torn. Make no mistake--the film was wonderful, to put it mildly, but, I won't even begin to debate its authenticity of the plot line--given that I'm a born and bred American who hasn't a clue as to how the Monarchy is perceived in modern England.<br/><br/>That being said, I had to think of ""Angels in America."" The play, later adapted to the small screen, took a particular community--that being those individuals directly living day to day with AIDS and HIV--and used them as a way to convey a bigger theme. Many categorize ""Angels"" as being an AIDS play--but the characters and their individual challenges are merely a catalyst to the overall message.<br/><br/>In ""The Queen,"" I felt the overall, universal message was watching what you've known to be true become false before your very eyes. Here we have Queen Elizabeth II, thrown into a position that, while hereditarily probable, was quite unrealistic in the broad scheme of things. She learned, at an impressionable age, the rhetoric and protocol that she wasn't raised to enforce. So, sitting on the throne for 50+ years, she reacts the way she feels is her legacy. She's seen, while choosing to ignore it at first, that she is quite wrong in her assumption. The people want and need more. While none of us has sat on throne in England (save, of course, the loo), we can all identify with the conflict at large.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren is uncanny in appearance and supposed conduct of Queen Elizabeth II. She conveys the confusion, agony, and submission of the Queen in such a palpable way that I stopped wondering or caring whether or not it was documented fact.<br/><br/>This could have been any family in Anywhere, World, and the message--accurate or not in its conveyance--was abundantly clear. No one likes to be thrown under the bus--whether we're raised to be in that position or whether we find ourselves there through no other reason than happenstance.<br/><br/>Ignore the details and enjoy the film for its message.

","""The Queen"" is an interesting look at the election of Tony Blair as British Prime Minister followed by the tragedy of the accidental death of Princess Diana, and how the two events effected the Royal Family and the whole country of Britian.<br/><br/>Blair is looking to 'modernize' British politics, which has already placed him at odds with the Queen. He shows her the proper respect even though it seems the thing to do rather than a heartfelt, genuine gesture. He's not much on protocol either and has suggested that everyone in the cabinet be on a first name basis. He gives every appearance of being a real person, whose wife does not know or care how to act in the presence of Royalty and drops an 'f-bomb' not twenty feel from Her Majesty.<br/><br/>Blair was elected in may 1997. In August of that year, Diana died. She was already divorced from Charles, so no longer a Royal. Its never stated by anyone, but the divorce was obviously quite an embarrassment and Diana's public life after wards even more so. No regret or emotion over her death is felt by the Queen or Prince Philip, but Prince Charles is devastated, and to a lesser degree of course, so is Tony Blair. Subsequently, the Royals offer no response of any kind, which is viewed more harshly as the days go by. Since 'there is no precedent' and standing firmly behind the fact that she was no longer HRH, the Royals are steadfast in their belief and stand their ground. Prince Philip and the Queen Mum seem to have the only views that the Queen can hear; she has only proverbial 'yes-men' surrounding her, and all that tradition of honor and dignity, and the belief that she knows the Brits better than anyone and what they expect from her and, more importantly, what they don't expect. Tony Blair finds himself in the difficult position of wanting to enlighten the Queen while having to respect her title. She's oblivious to the fact that Diana was deeply loved, apart from her marriage, and he knows she's making a mistake. Prince Charles is seen as something of a simp and never confronts his Mother about his wish for a public funeral - that's left largely to Tony Blair to do. She's none too pleased with him but one day realizes he's right. She's finally able to bend without breaking. The Queen makes a public statement, expressing a lot of emotion while actually showing none at all.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren is an actress I've enjoyed in several movies such as ""Some Mother's Son"", ""Greenfingers"" and ""Calendar Girls"" and of course she's very good in this movie. It appears as though its an easy part to play and you're not exactly stretching every acting muscle you've got so I can't quite jump on the she-has-to-win-the-Oscar bandwagon, although I suspect she will. Lately it seems all you have to do is portray a real person. In the fifties, playing a prostitute got you one. Times change. I have to say I was a little disappointed with the scene in which she finally breaks down long enough to cry. Mirren is seen from behind, and I always think an actor can cheat by not having to be shown shedding any real tears. Either that or the director finally gave up hoping for the ideal shot and caved in by request. After I thought about it I realized that by not seeing her cry was the perfect way to show her crying, as its consistent with the 'stiff-upper lip', stone-face image seen by the public.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed Michael Sheen, who I just saw in ""Blood Diamond"" a couple of days ago. He also merits awards attention. James Cromwell and Sylvia Syms are very good, too, although like I mentioned before, underplaying seems less impressive, especially when everyone is doing it.<br/><br/>The thing I got to most out of was the that the events showed all angles, and the difference between feeling what you want to feel about anything and what you think you're supposed to be feeling. The fact that the Royals only viewed Diana in terms of how she effected them and their legacy seemed grossly unfair, both to her and to themselves. She was a remarkable woman and the world lost a real treasure when she died prematurely.<br/><br/>8/10."

","Surprisingly, as a monarchist, I enjoyed this film very much. Helen Mirren was superb.<br/><br/>One aspect of this film which I did not like, and I thought was over the top, was the dialogue of James Cromwell (Prince Phillip). No one will ever know exactly what the members of the Royal Family said to one another at this time. In once scene, Phillip states how Princess Margaret said that ""Diana is more annoying in death, than in life"". By all accounts, Princesses Margaret and Diana were friendly and Diana admired Margaret very much. I cannot for one moment believe that Margaret would have been so callous. For the writers of this film to associate this statement with the Queen's sister was unfair. Further, when Charles and Diana's marriage was crumbling, those close to the Royal Family have consistently said that no one tried harder than Phillip to save the marriage. He truly liked Diana, as evidenced by his decision to walk behind her casket in the funeral procession.<br/><br/>The dead cannot respond, let alone living members of the Royal family.<br/><br/>The inference in the film that Charles was trying to align himself with Tony Blair to dodge an imagined assassin's bullet, and in doing so make his Mother the target, is just sheer stupidity! As an Australian citizen, Elizabeth the Second is my Head of State, and I have always had the utmost respect for her commitment to her role and her duty to her people. For nearly 55 years she has served with great districting.<br/><br/>I always thought that the treatment of the Queen following Diana's death was incredibly unfair. The hysteria over the flag above Buckingham palace (of which there is none when the Monarch is not in residence) is a perfect example of the unjustified, and at times hysterical, criticism of the Queen during this time."

","I love Helen Mirren, every un-botoxed square inch of that expressive face.<br/><br/>My first view of her was on public television playing Jane Tennison, a middle aged detective fighting sexism while solving the most gruesome crimes. She turned what would have been just another detective show into a human drama .<br/><br/>I next saw her in ""Age of consent"" a film made in 1969 when she was playing the young sexual temptation to James Mason. Wow, what a dish, She could have tempted anyone. Other actresses have attempted to preserve their youthfulness. But Helen Mirren had more to give. She has her humanity.<br/><br/>In ""The Queen"" she was an elderly Queen Elizabeth facing the challenge of reacting to the overwhelming national pain on the death of Princess Diana. It was a challenge that Elizabeth, for whom emotions are something to be contained rather than ever expressed, was unable to meet.<br/><br/>The film interwove archival footage with dramatizations of the reactions of the Royal family and the interplay of the new Tony Blair government. These few days of crisis shed light on a thousand years of tradition that has formed the complex relationship between the people of Great Britain and their Sovereigns. It is the story of two families. One is that of Elizabeth and Phillip and their progeny. The other family is the larger one, where Elizabeth has a place in the hearts of every English subject who has ever sang, ""God save our Queen."" I faintly remember the young and beautiful Princess Elizabeth when she was crowned in the 1950s. I knew, through documentaries, of her family, and her preternatural coolness toward her first born, Charles, whom she abandoned as an infant for a half year as she and her husband toured the world. She hated Diana, for many reasons, but clearly because she would no sooner had left her children than she would have cut off her arm. Diana, whatever her limitations, had a natural affection for people, crowds or intimates, that Elizabeth lacked.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren, and those who wrote and directed this film, managed to build on all that we know about the public figures who were represented. They were true to reality, so the private glimpses, whether real or imagined, were all the more poignant.<br/><br/>There was a scene, I don't think this counts as a spoiler, when she finally relented and walked among those who were congregating to mourn Diana, with mounds of flowers, many castigating the royal family. When she asked a child whether she could add her bouquet to the pile the child said simply, ""no, these are for you."" I was touched deeply. All the pain of a lifetime of restraint, and of isolation, was captured in that simple act of love for a woman, a mother of a country, whose place in the hearts of her people is indelible. <br/><br/>The film is a gem."

The way that news archive footage intertwines with the film is seamless and professional, and there are times when I am confused whether it's a news footage or not.<br/><br/>The sets are realistically done without being over the top.

It could not go to a more deserving actor.<br/><br/>The film is really well done, with the thoughtfulness, style and grace needed to depict the sensitive subject of the aftermath of Princess Diana's severely untimely death. Mirren's uncanny ability to evoke Elizabeth II electrifies every frame she appears in. I appreciated especially how we never truly get inside her head; she remains a cypher of sorts til the very end of the movie, although there are a few scenes where she does allow human emotion to break through the surface, but it's always done in a controlled way. The most revealing scene features a stag, whom the Queen is trying to shoo off so he's not hunted down; we can easily see how she relates herself to this inevitably trapped animal - it's a supremely effective analogy for her own life, and this scene is also done in a restrained way, keeping it elegant, subtle and sublime. <br/><br/>Also especially effective here is Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, who manages just the right balance of respect for his Queen, along with the clear-headedness befitting his own position."

","I expected this to included more of Elizabeth's life-story than it did, but given that it dwells solely upon the royals' reaction to Diana's death, it still provided a ""new"" view of life AS a royal. The actual pictures of a nation plunged into despair--leaving bundles of flowers at Kensington Palace---once seemed so tear-jerking. All these years later , those shots recall similar scenes of thousands leaving flowers throughout lower Manhattan days after 911. The sole difference being that those flowers were left for thousands of American ""commoners""--who one fateful day had to go to work, and died for doing so--for trying to care for their families. The old scenes scenes of distress for the death of a women who died in a glamor car after leaving the Ritz suddenly feel so dated and over-the-top. Diana was never the ""Peoples' Princess""--she was an uneducated, wealthy spoiled aristocrat, anorexic, and troubled young woman who manipulated the Press to ""earn"" her status, and then had that same Press pronounced by her brother, in footage shown in the movie, as being responsible for her death. Helen Mirren portrays subtle character changes with grace and dignity. She does not rush into these, and other images--driving herself in an old battered car, stranded in a river in a car, constantly awakened to deal with new information, her first meeting with Tony Blair, and recollections of having met Churchill in that same setting when still a young girl herself lend depth to her character's development. She, a young girl,yet Queen, dealing with matters of State. Diana , a young girl, sweeping past photographers with her glamor beau into a glamor car. Two very different lives are portrayed, with two very different life-plans. Anyone watching the movie will come away with their own opinion--NO conclusion or judgement is forced upon the audience."

She did not behave ""Royally"" and, because of this, was loved by those who saw the crown as either an anachronism or an aloof presence, and decried by those who saw her as not living up to her role as a public royal persona.<br/><br/>The centerpiece of course, and the hub around which the movie rotates, is Helen Mirren as Elizabeth. Coiffed to perfection in the famous matronly curls, she morphs effortlessly into the famous disciplined and bland grand matron. A Queen who is staunchly independent and rock sure of herself until she is faced with the prime crisis of her rule; when it slowly dawns on her that her subjects require of her a humanity and a sensitivity that she thought would undermine her role as stoic in chief.<br/><br/>Mirren is superb and will get nominated for this role. She has now managed to play both Queen Elizabeth's in the span of a year, and has done it oh so convincingly. Those who love her work should not miss her reprise of Inspector Tennyson on PBS this week, where she disappears again into a role that is so opposite of the Elizabeths in style, and yet so similar in strength.<br/><br/>Everyone else around her either sinks into caricature, or falters because of their dissimilarity to the real people. John Cromwell, while a strong actor, is wrong as the Duke: he's too craggy, too crabby, and too American. The Duke is chisel handsome, haughty, and speaks crisply. The woman chosen for the Queen Mum is also totally wrong. She's too big - rather than petite - and too slavic. The man playing Blair (Sheen?) certainly resembles him, but smiles to much and exaggerates the famous Blair exuberance to the point of seeming to be on speed. Even worse he reminded me of ""Speedy"" of Alka Seltzer fame.<br/><br/>While effort is made to make Charles appear sympathetic, the man chosen to play him never manages to capture his controlled, yet casual, hauteur, and whose face looks so unlike the long, oval, large featured, one of Charles, that I found myself having to remind myself of whom he was playing.<br/><br/>The problem of the movie is that it seldom rings true. The Blairs chatter to each other as if they have only just learned to explain themselves, while in fact they are being asked to do so for the audience. It is this insistence on continuously explaining the events to the audience that takes it from a drama to be observed and pondered over, to a soap opera, albeit a grand one at times, of ""a week in the life of a Queen."""
"jeuneidiot","7","1","2","16 November 2006"," Royalty falters in mourning the Princess, Blair saves the day
","I never expected a movie about as dull a subject as the royal family's reaction to the death of Princess Diana to be so interesting. Tony Blair is cast in a hero's role (did the 'Vote for Tony' people make this movie?) and the royals look quite bad with Charles looking doltish throughout and Prince Phillip as a totally selfish, pompous curmudgeon. The truly interesting character and indeed the stellar performance of the film was Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II. She is shown as a private, stoic woman, who might be out of touch with the commoners, but is willing to slowly change herself and her actions to save their views of monarchy and to meet the needs of her subjects. By the end of the film, one feels quite vigorously in favor of Queen Elizabeth and her rule, but sees that monarchy in Britain may and probably should end with her. <br/><br/>This movie is like sponge cake topped with strawberries. When you think of sponge cake, you think of bland, spongy, edible foam. But when you get a good sponge cake the sweetness and texture isn't bland at all, and if you top it with good strawberries, it adds a delicate sharpness to the whole. You now have an intricate dessert, easy to understand, but complex in its flavor and not heavy on the stomach or guilty in the mind. 7/10<br/><br/>http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"

","Read This and Other Reviews at TheExpeditioner.com<br/><br/>Given the title of the film itself: ""The Queen,"" as well as the quote that Stephen Frears chooses to open his foray into that tricky realm of storytelling based on contemporary history: ""Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,"" it is understandable that the audience may be more than a little misled as to whose story this film is really choosing to tell. Of course it is the story of Queen Elizabeth II -- brilliantly portrayed in an understated but nuanced performance by Helen Mirren -- but in truth the story is less about the Queen than it is of the true British head of state, Tony Blair, whose position as Prime Minister forces him to maintain an awkward balancing act between serving as the true constitutional ruler of Great Britain and the antiquated but, as highlighted so well in the film, not entirely symbolically servant of the monarch. It is in this awkward position that Blair begins his tenure of rule and it is the film's focus on the interplay between the two that helps to elevate ""The Queen"" from a simple retelling of the much documented schism between the Queen and the public at large during the week following Princess Diana's death to a prescient and insightful examination of the role that the public support plays in the daily workings of any ruler, democratically elected or not.<br/><br/>In ""The Queen,"" Michael Sheen portrays Tony Blair -- in an equally as spot-on performance as Mirren -- as possessing those everyman qualities that Blair so successfully used to succeed as leader of the Labour Party. From his social awkwardness in formal situations to his insistence that his staff at 10 Downing refer to him as ""Tony,"" Blair's scenes contrasted with those of the Queen's serve well to highlight the very real detachment between the Monarch and the people which it has inherited the right to represent and the similarities Blair shares with the people that he, on the other hand, has been chosen to represent.<br/><br/>It is Blair's understanding of the public, given his emergence from their ranks, as well as his awareness of the changing role of the monarch -- once as true ruler and chief voice of the nation to its present form as a symbol of the state and its people -- that leads him to realize the need for the Queen, in the midst of Diana's death, to act, as was described of Bush following 9-11, as the Mourner-in-Chief. Instead the Queen relies on monarchial protocol to guide her during those dark days, insisting that the flag at Buckingham Palace not be flown at half-mast (it wasn't flown at half-mast for her father's death) to her flippant decision not to hold a state funeral (Diana isn't even considered an HRH anymore), a choice that severely miscalculated the public need for public mourning.<br/><br/>As the film progresses we witness Blair cajoling the Queen, whose reluctance to follow the Prime Minister's recommendations was quickly snowballing into talk of open insurrection and calls for the monarch's abolishment, to return to London and to treat Diana's death as a royal occasion, with all the pomp and circumstances that are expected to accompany such events. In a telling sequence of events Blair is compelled to rely on the Queen's staff, whose actions are openly defiant to her wishes but are met with futile resistance, to force her to console the public with a public address and to allow for a full state funeral.<br/><br/>As the week progresses Blair becomes increasingly agitated at the joy others are taking, including his staff and wife, with the growing public discontent documented in evermore virulent headlines splashed across the morning dailies. His empathy and unwavering respect for the Queen confuses his wife, who accuses him at one point of ""falling for her just like the rest of them."" But Blair understands, better than anyone else, that those in power can make very easy targets and that it can indeed be very lonely at the top. He understands that Queens, and even Prime Ministers, in their insulated and highly scrutinized world, are like everyone else. (This fact is driven home by Frears insistence to depict both the Queen and Blair in very homely situations throughout the film: the Queen and her family crowded around the T.V. in their frumpy bathrobes, the Queen welling up at the thought of a local stag being killed by her husband, Blair sitting down with his family to a very provincial dinner in his small, unkept kitchen.) Most importantly, and at the film's core, Blair understands that a ruler's reputation is only as good as that day's headlines and that more likely than not he himself may have to suffer a similar ordeal. Blair's decision to go to Iraq and the subsequent fallout is of course the elephant in the theater that emerges during every scene where Blair is defending the Queen and falling over himself to mend her mistakes. Watching the film the audience can't help analogizing the two situations and wondering how such a skilled and crafty politician, who so successfully brought a nation together and single-handedly helped to preserve the longest lasting monarchy in the Western Hemisphere during that fateful week, could have so greatly miscalculated the public reaction that going to war would cause and the consequences of his decision. As occurred to the Queen, Blair's public detachment and aloofness created a lethal combination for someone whose power is so directly controlled by the will of the people. What makes it so amazing is that Blair knew this fact all too well. Which makes me wonder if not another Shakespeare quote may have been more fitting to begin the film: ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in the stars but in ourselves."" For Blair this was only all too true."
"harrietmwelsh","10","1","2","5 November 2006"," An Extraordinary Portrait
","Probably no institution is as revered, reviled, dysfunctional and unique as the British Royal Family. In this extremely personal and focused look at a famously private yet globally exposed monarch, director Frears and actor Mirren achieve the near impossible. How can such a hermetically sealed personality be shown in depth? By the end of the film, one actually comes away feeling as if one knows this virtually unknowable family, and most impressively, the title character.<br/><br/>The tension and drama of the film arise from the isolated period it portrays, which demonstrates in microcosm the flaws, failures and ultimate devotion to duty of the British monarchy. Frears closely examines the seemingly frozen Queen Elizabeth and family during a period of huge public trauma, the death of Princess Diana. The unprecedented emotional gulf between titular ruler and her people (without overemphasizing the point, the film makes clear that the Royals play a merely ceremonial role in the actual governance of the country) at first is laughable, even shocking. The coldness of this family, its brittle stiff upper lip, the lack of communication, the aversion not only to public but any private display of warmth, is stereotypically British taken to the furthest extreme. Yet on this occasion, Elizabeth (and her comically obtuse consort, brilliantly played by James Cromwell) have totally failed to anticipate -- or even acknowledge, once it becomes painfully obvious -- the uncharacteristic bathos of grief that swept not only Britain, but the world, at Diana's sudden death. (In fairness, I don't know that anyone could have predicted the global sense of deep loss at that time -- I was amazed at my own tears and pain.) <br/><br/>The schism, far from being a mere difference in emotional temperature, turns into a threat to the very institution of the monarchy itself. The film's humanity turns on the point when Elizabeth makes a tortured choice, torn between upbringing and temperament on the one hand, and on the other, the need for a change, out of duty to the nation and the continued existence of a royal family. The art of this movie is that even though the correct path to take would seem natural to anyone else, we understand why it is such a wrenching, even terrifying move to one raised to revere precedence and dignity not for their own sake, but the sake of the nation and over 1000 years of history. Against my will, I admired this woman by the end of the film (just don't ask me to marry her son!).<br/><br/>The magic is all done with great subtlety. It works so well because Frears keeps a literal tight focus on the faces of the small and excellent cast through most of the film, intercut with actual news footage of the time showing greater and greater throngs of mourners. This heightens the sense of separation between the monarch and the public, whom she experiences exclusively via the television. The royal world is very small, claustrophobic, while the shots of the grieving crowd (only seen in grainy distance shots on television)eventually rival the famous shot from ""Gone With The Wind"" of the panorama of wounded soldiers stretching to the far horizon.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren's accomplishment cannot be praised enough. Somehow this attractive woman actually becomes the physical embodiment of the famously dowdy Elizabeth (albiet an Elizabeth on a very good day), and says more in a raised eyebrow, a sidelong glance, than the terse monarch would even dream of saying aloud. We also get to see tiny glimpses of what she would never willingly reveal: a woman capable of deep feeling, frustration, even helplessness.<br/><br/>The remainder of the cast is just as spot-on. The movie would never work without superlative performers, and fortunately everyone, from the queen's long-suffering personal secretary, to the newly-elected Tony Blair and his very modern wife, to the most lowly gamesmen at Balmoral Castle, is not merely believable but also fully-developed.<br/><br/>This is not just a film for tabloid readers of slavish followers of Things Royal. This is a fascinating character study set at a time still very fresh and evocative in the public memory, and thoroughly absorbing.<br/><br/>Highest recommendations for Her Highness, ""The Queen."""
"ArizWldcat","10","1","2","4 November 2006"," Interesting account of one week
","in the life of the rulers of Britain, and the prime minister. Where do I start? I was so thankful to FINALLY have a movie worth seeing (even though I had to drive to Salt Lake City, 30 miles away, to see it, since either the movie theater owners up here in Hicksville, er, Ogden, don't think we will understand it, or legitimately, there just isn't the audience up here.) (It's one of my pet peeves that the only movies we're offered up here are blockbuster crowd-pleaser type, wide audience movies, without ONE TEENY little screen being offered for those of us who would rather see something with a little more substance). THis movie opened yesterday (Friday afternoon) in Salt Lake City, and I attended the 2:30 show. I was pleased that there was actually a LINE that I had to wait in! The theater wasn't chock full, but then, it was mid afternoon, when it's usually pretty quiet.<br/><br/>What a treat this was! I am old enough to remember when Charles was the eligible bachelor looking for a bride, and I have to admit (with a red face) that I joined in the crowds watching the big wedding in 1981. I am one year older than Diana was, so in that aspect, I could relate to her. By 1997, however, Charles and Diana had divorced, and the public had, for the most part, sided with Diana, who was seen as more caring than the rest of the royal family. Her private side was never seen by us, a point made brilliantly in this film. I remember when Diana died, there were people who were decrying that she had died when she had finally found ""true love"" (sorry, but I sincerely DOUBT IT). Anyway, ""THe Queen"" is a study of the old monarchy trying to come to grips with the changing world (or should I say ""changed"").<br/><br/>Helen Mirren is nothing short of brilliant. She absolutely disappeared into the character of QEII, so effectively that I forgot at times that I was watching a movie, and started to believe that she was actually Elizabeth II. I have to admit that I know next to nothing about royal protocol, and it was quite interesting to hear about it through this film. Michael Sheen was also brilliant as Tony Blair, as was James Cromwell as Prince Phillip. This movie probably has the best ensemble cast of any film I've seen this year. The last movie I saw that I enjoyed this much was ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" another movie with a fine ensemble cast. I am hoping that since the holidays are approaching, there will be more choices out there for we moviegoers who want something a little more thoughtful than the usual fare. Thanks to the filmmakers for a fine experience."
"susanbeach-1","8","1","2","30 October 2006"," even-handed fascinating fictionalization
","Stepehen Frears has done an excellent job in presenting both sides of the tricky situation in which the Royal House of Windsor found itself at the death of the Princess of Wales. While the Foyal Family sees this as a private matter (Diana is no longer a royal, after all), the Labour Government rightly senses the pulse of the nation and capitalizes on the death of the ""People's Princess,"" as one of Tony Blair's aides writes in his speech to the electorate to rally the anti-monarchy troops. The portrayal of the royal family, muddling through as best they could and following hundreds of years of tradition, could have been very badly handled by Frears, with overt partisanship, for example, but the obvious was avoided and even-handedness ruled the day. Helen Mirren puts in an award-winning performance portraying a complex character. The supporting cast is uniformly good also."

","I just came back from seeing this movie and I have to say that although the film is great Helen Mirren is FAN-TAS-TIC! Her resemblance to the Queen is really something. From the look to the way she stands, that's what I call a performance. She should be definitely in the Oscar Race for best Actress.<br/><br/>I was still living in France when Princess Diana died. Therefore I didn't see nor remember all the details and how the crowds reacted to the silence of the royal family. That was greatly showed in the movie as well as the different personalities of each member of the Royal Family reacting on the public's grief.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact that Frears avoided all the clich√© we saw a million times when it all happened which makes the movie even more interesting."
"cox007_526","8","1","2","29 October 2006"," Well acted by an ensemble cast and Mirren Oscar material
","The movie clearly based on the emotions of the people and the lack of emotion shown by the Queen is brilliantly done. The only disappointment is that the film is like a Labour propaganda movie displaying Prime Minister Blair as the hero of the people, but Helen Mirren best epitomises the role of the Queen and as the story unfolds she comes out with dignity. The ensemble cast are excellent and those that play Alastait Campbell and Tony Blair do justice to the roles as indeed Cherie Blair who I imagine is exactly as she is portrayed. The best line in the movie comes from The Queen in answer to a remark from Mr Blair she says- You were afraid that the headlines may apply to you one day- How accurate is that? The Queen is an excellent film and Helen Mirren deserved of an Oscar though I have no doubt she will be pipped by some other meaningless performance from an actress not originated from these shores or from the continent."
"wisewebwoman","10","1","2","29 October 2006"," Flawless performances, splendid script
","Helen Mirren gives the performance of a lifetime in this film that depicts the months around the death of Diana ""the people's princess"" 9 years ago and focuses mainly on the interaction between herself and the newly elected prime minister, Tony Blair, played almost eerily by Michael Sheen. Indeed the whole cast is flawless.<br/><br/>The script is subtle and the cinematography spellbinding. The queen, with her regal waddle and her careening dogs, are captured to such a degree on screen that one is there, in that brief few months of time, as she vacillates as to what to do in the light of her public's adoration for the ex-wife of her son. Her instinct tells her to remove herself and her family to her estate in Scotland where her husband, Prince Philip, played by the reliable James Cromwell as a stiff twit, insists on taking Diana's young sons out for a spot of shooting helpless highland creatures to get their minds of their mother's death.<br/><br/>This could all come off as crude caricature in the style of ""Spitting Image"" but thanks to the remarkable director, Stephen Frears and a tight script by Peter Morgan, it brings out the humanity in all concerned.<br/><br/>Alex Jennings, as Prince Charles, gives a wonderfully understated performance as the lost Crown Prince, distant from his mother, concerned for his motherless boys and adamant of his attendance on Diana in Paris against his mother's wishes. Sylvia Syms is a delightful surprise as a gin-soaked Queen Mother far removed from any compassion.<br/><br/>It is made totally clear that the family had no time for Diana either in life or now in death and they want her buried in a hurry by the Spencer family so that they all can get on with their lives.<br/><br/>The story of the Queen's about face on her decision is the bones of the film and it is riveting right to the end. A rare 10 out of 10 from me. I would see it again and probably again."

","Every once and a while, you sit in a theatre completely memorized by an acting performance. I remember the press screening of Monster and how amazingly Charlize Theron was able to transform herself into serial killer Aileen Wuournos. The conversation amongst critics in the lobby after the showing was just aglow with 'just give her the Oscar' speeches.<br/><br/>We did the same for Nicholas Cage after Leaving Las Vegas and with Jamie Foxx in Ray. Sometimes an actor is just able to transform themselves into another character and is able to transport the audience to a time and place where they believe the character to be real and the depiction, flawless.<br/><br/>Well, here we go again. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth in the new Stephen Frears film The Queen is the performance of the year. Bar none.<br/><br/>The Queen is the story of the how the Royal Family personally and privately dealt with the death of Princess Diana in late August of 1997. The film begins a few months earlier with the appointment of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as British Prime Minister. Blair's first encounter with the Queen and his orientation on how to act, move and deliver in front of her royalness gives us our first glimpse into the sheltered and privileged life of the monarchy.<br/><br/>Fast forward to August 30, 1997. We relive the events of that day in a reenactment that has paparazzi jumping on their scooters and following Diana with flashbulbs ablazing in the darkened Paris night. We watch as the car carrying the People's Princess goes into the tunnel and without showing any graphics of the accident on the screen, we recount the news reports and violent photos of the incident that the newspapers and television programs ingrained in our memory.<br/><br/>The Royals don't seem to comprehend the indelible imprint Diana made on both the British people and those around the world. As fans and mourners converge in London with flowers and well wishes, the Royals maintain that they want to keep the matter private and they fail to relate to the British people and their need to hear from the throne. It doesn't help that The Queen and family don't share any emotional attachment to Diana. They comment on how she is not part of the family and how Diana uses the press when it suits her and complains when they become intrusive.<br/><br/>It is here that Tony Blair comes to the rescue. Played with vigor by Sheen and using his Chaschire grin to his advantage, Tony brings a sane voice to a confused Palace. Still new to power but in front of the cameras as the Royal's cower in their lavishness, Blair is relentless in his attempts to have the Queen make certain statements such as a press statement and the lowering of the flag over the Palace, in an attempt to save the Queen and the family from the ruthless British Press that is asking in front page bold letters for the Royal Highness to recognize in some way the life of the beloved Princess.<br/><br/>The Queen is just as much a film about being out of touch with the changing world as it is about the death and reacts of the death of the Princess. As the Queen struggles with the understanding of her people (she cries more for a slain deer than she does for the death of a family member), you feel sorry for someone who has lived such a life of privilege and has been so sequestered from the everyday life of her people that they fail to understand and relate to anything outside of their twelve foot walls. As I watched ¬ñ and I will be the only reviewer on the face of the earth to put these two in the same sentence ¬ñ I thought of the Queen as I do Paris Hilton. It isn't Hilton's fault (well, not entirely) that she doesn't know the value of money or understand what a hard days work might entail. These rich folk live a life that we can't understand just as they have problems relating to the blue collar public.<br/><br/>And that is what makes The Queen so fascinating. To see Elizabeth II, Prince Phillip (James Cromwell holds his own against Mirren and has the best lines such as ""Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think we're mad!"") and Prince Charles deal with the death in their own understanding is completely engrossing and the acting by all those playing members of the Royal Family are so convincing that you almost feel like you are sitting in Buckingham Palace listening to them squabble.<br/><br/>And it is the acting that separates The Queen from the average film. I could have sat and watched Mirren and Sheen for another hour as they talk about life, Britain and the people to which the rule. Interesting fact: Sheen is playing Blair again in another Stephen Frears film about his rise to power due out sometime in 2007. But it is Mirren that you will most remember. At a recent festival, her performance was met with a five minute standing ovation at the conclusion of the film. The only thing remaining is the hardware to go along with the performance and I bet you can safely begin to etch her name on the bottom of the Oscar with still two months of film releases to go.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"
"LeRoyMarko","10","1","2","28 October 2006"," Triumph
","Excellent movie by director Stephen Frears. He adroitly captures the mood of a nation, of most of the world in fact, that first week of September, almost ten years ago. The part that is fiction though shows the way the Royal family reacted to Lady Di's death. Who knows for sure how they reacted? But that's what also interesting about this film. It puts a human face on a personage known only in public. That was easy with Diana, it's more challenging to do for Elizabeth. Have you ever tried to imagine what the Queen does when she's relaxing in her private apartments? The movie reminds us that she's not only an old woman waving while sporting colorful hats. <br/><br/>That brings me to the way Frears depicts the Royals. The Queen is of course rigid. But one can sense some sensibility some times, quickly put away by the more present sense of duty. Funny to think that the two Royals that are shown as the most insensitive are the ones that are usually considered more accessible: Prince Philip and the Queen mother (now dead, of course). All the Royals and their staff, but also Tony Blair and his entourage are brilliantly played by an excellent cast. At the top: Helen Mirren. She's just great. <br/><br/>A word on the use of footages from the archives. I think the director did an excellent job of mixing those with the fictionalized parts.<br/><br/>A question remains though: has the Queen seen the movie? If so, could she please let us know what she thought of it by posting a comment on IMDb? This would truly show the world that she's able to modernize her institution!<br/><br/>Seen in Toronto, at the Beach Cinemas, on October 28th, 2006. <br/><br/>88/100 (***¬Ω)"

","I am surprised how much I like the film. The whole saga surround Diana's death, as any important historical event, interests me a great deal, but the story looks perfect for a made-for-TV documentary on History Channel instead of a full-blown movie. I was wrong, because what Stephen Frears created is a fascinating portrayal of the royal family after the tragedy that deserves the big screen treatment. The script is sharp and witty, with unexpected humors permeated throughout. The real-life footages are adeptly used. We will never know how accurate the story is given the secrecy of the institution, but what is shown on the screen grabbed me deeply.<br/><br/>Still, the film would not have the effect it generated without truly the best performance of the year. Like Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Capote, Helen Mirren did not act as Elizabeth II; she became Elizabeth II. Yes, her manner is spot on; however, what she did is so much more than just a mimicry. She gave the character life without overplaying it. We sense her conflicting emotions through facial expressions and body language. It's such a refreshingly understated, multi-layered performance at a time where many actors try to wow the audience by yelling, breaking down hysterically, and overacting. Give her the Oscar now.<br/><br/>Among the supporting roles, Michael Sheen shined as Tony Blair. The story is quite favorable toward Blair, implying he is one who saved the monarchy, but Sheen also made us connect with him. Alex Jennings showed Prince Charles' emotional side in limited screen time. The only complaint I have is regarding James Cromwell. Maybe Prince Philip is equally stubborn in real life, but the one-noted character in the film certainly got on my nerve with his constant rants toward Diana.<br/><br/>Overall, the docudrama is definitely one of the best films I have seen this year. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>A-"

","Helen Mirren does a fabulous job of conveying the confusion and pain that comes from a lifetime of restraining one's emotions and ""doing things properly"". I come from a family that has always prided itself on its restraint and dignity (we eat pasta, but find Italians confusing), and so watching Her Majesty struggle with the conflicts between her public and private lives gave me an awful lot to think about. Michael Sheen plays Tony Blair in his early, younger days in office, when Blair was still full of pep, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Sheen is a real cutey-pie in this part - even washes up the dishes for Cherie. Ya gotta love it. All in all, this is a good picture for people with brains and for those who are interested in the clash between the traditional and the modern.<br/><br/>I hope Mirren gets an Oscar for this, because then she would get an audience with the Real Queen Elizabeth II, and wow, would I like to be a fly on the wall for that one!"

","I have never really understood the purpose of a Monarchy, and I never appreciated just what kinds of pressure the Royal Family are constantly under. Helen Mirren was excellent in her portrayal of the Queen, and really showed the best and the worst of the Queen's personality, though her undeniable love for her family and her respect for her people really shone through. The supporting roles were also wonderful - a delightfully not-bothered Sylvia Syms was superb as the Queen Mother. This film was sensitively written, and it was a real testament to the creative team that they did not exploit the more painful elements in the story. I was glad that Princes William and Harry were not shown in any real way at all, and the same with Diana. It would have been most unkind to do so, and the creators did no such thing!!! Definitely worth a watch!!!!"
"ferguson-6","8","1","2","22 October 2006"," There are no real Fairy Tales
","Greetings again from the darkness. ""And the Oscar goes to ... Helen Mirren"". It appears the talented and charming star of such films as ""Calendar Girls"" and ""Gosford Park"" may just hear those words in 2007. She captures the spirit, look and nuances of Queen Elizabeth II in this behind the scenes peek at the clashes between the government and monarchy in the few days after Princess Di's death.<br/><br/>There could have been no better selection for director than full Brit, Stephen Frears who is known for such fine films as ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" and ""Dangerous Liasons"". We never doubt for a moment, Frears love of his homeland nor his insight into the public confusion in regards to the royal snubbing of Diana and the citizens in those first painful days. He does make a bit of a hero out of newly elected Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair (an effective, if slightly over the top performance by Michael Sheen). Blair does speak many of the lines that were in the thoughts of the world at that time ... such as ""Somebody save these people from themselves"".<br/><br/>By mixing in real news video and grainy recreations of the Royal Family, Frears does a nice job of putting us back in 1997. Casting for the Royal Family is completed by Sylvia Syms as The Queen Mother, James Cromwell as a slightly daft Prince Philip and Alex Jennings as a very caring a weak Prince Charles, who seems to understand the issues, but lacks the back bone to make it happen.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt Helen Mirren's moment to shine and she is downright chilling at times. How odd to see an authoritative figure who really only seems at ease and happy when walking her well trained dogs. Fifty years of putting up a front in which you believe so strongly, but is so out of touch with one's world is quite a burden. Of course, as an American I am only an outside observer to the whole situation, but I do feel Mr. Frears captures the chasm between the masses and the Monarchy."

Although the characters were all overdone - Prince Charles the weak-kneed dolt, Queen Mum the half mad old lady, Prince Philip the hot-headed guy, always shooting off his mouth, Tony Blair, the eager lapdog, and Queen Elizabeth the uptight, over-self-conscious monarch...despite all that, the story was great.<br/><br/>The acting by Helen Mirin was superb. The scenes by Balmoral were spectacular. And the deer metaphor really worked in this movie.<br/><br/>It is a refreshing look at the hysteria of that week from the perspective of someone who probably had more invested in Diana's life (and consequently her death) than almost anyone else."

","Helen Mirren's performance will likely win her an Oscar and she is most deserving of one for this role. You literally forget you're watching Mirren in this film - so subtle and so effective is her portrait of the living monarch. She manages to humanize the public figure, but still maintains her considerable dignity and mystique at the same time.<br/><br/>Kudos to Stephen Frears for making so many intelligent choices in his direction: while the real Royal family might not appreciate the attention that this film presents, I would highly doubt they would take great offense to any of their portrayals in this film. It is honest and classy, without being exploitative.<br/><br/>I especially appreciated Frears' decision to almost show nothing of the boys, William and Harry. We only see Charles comforting them the night of Diana's death, and catch glimpses of them once or twice more, but absolutely no dialogue. In a film that delves into the inner minds of the main players at such a tragic time, it was a classy choice not to turn the boys into film characters for this plot. It wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>Instead, we focus on the real heart of this film - the tension between conservative tradition and modern sensibilities. The contrast between the Queen and PM Tony Blair is a perfect metaphor for this conflict.<br/><br/>But it isn't all cut and dry, of course. The Queen is also portrayed here as stubborn and perhaps a little naive about the growing public mood sweeping the world following Diana's tragic death. Little of the Queen's well-documented and well-founded disdain for Diana is emphasized here. For those with a strong sense of history, we understand already what happened between Charles and Diana and how things went so poorly.<br/><br/>The best scene in the film - when the Queen's jeep gets stuck in the river on her Balmoral estate and she spots a beautiful stag nearby. Later she learns the stag has been shot dead by hunters and she goes to see the body at a neighbouring estate to pay her respects in a way. What a beautiful metaphor! I have little doubt that this film will be seen as one of the best of the year. In addition to Mirren's Oscar nomination and likely win, I see 'The Queen' having an excellent chance at a Best Picture nod and many other nominations, including screenplay. Well done to EVERYONE involved."

"frankiehudson","9","1","2","13 October 2006"," Great acting, good story.
","This is a sensational, outstanding film from director Stephen Frears, the man who brought us The Deal (2003), also featuring Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Queen is all about one week in the life of HM the Queen and Tony Blair, shortly after he came to power in 1997.<br/><br/>Sheen is quite simply outstanding in this film, spot-on as Blair in his early days as Prime Minister. His uncanny resemblance to Tony Blair should keep him in work for life. We see him anointed as Prime Minister by Helen Mirren, with his idiot, fruitcake wife Cherie Blair giggling in the background like a schoolgirl. The mannerisms, the gait, the speech are Blair personified.<br/><br/>Later on, in his early dealings with the public and the media, Sheen is perfect with Blair's silly, meaningless, distracting moving of his arms and hands every time he speaks, as if it somehow contributes to communication.<br/><br/>Likewise, Helen Mirren has delivered possibly her finest ever performance. There are a lot of close-up, intimate shots of Mirren's face, at point-blank focus, capturing the inner self of the Queen. A lot of the action takes place up at Balmoral, in the Scottish highlands, and there are some spectacular shots of the dramatic landscape.<br/><br/>There are many, many fine performances in this film, particularly James Cromwell as an unremittingly grumpy Prince Philip, and Mark Bazeley as the media/PR guru and professional northerner (and Burnley man) Alistair Campbell, the man who writes the speeches (he coins ""People's Princess) and runs the media side of things. A sort of Rasputin of communications.<br/><br/>One of the themes of the film is how the media and newspapers in particular work; there are lots of front pages, reviewed, seemingly dictating how the funeral of the moron, bimbo-extraordinaire Diana should be staged.<br/><br/>There is a lot of hunting in the highlands, lots of Land Rovers. It's quite charming how the Queen prefers an old banger of a car over a new one and you learn more about her such as when she was a mechanic in the British Army during the war.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure of the significance of the hunting and stag motifs. The Queen comes face to face with a stag and later on covers up her disquiet when she learns it has been shot. Something to do with crowns and stalking, probably.<br/><br/>When, in 20 years time (if the world still exists), they come to make the film of how Blair took Britain to war, Michael Sheen can draw on Hitler for added authenticity"
"MaxBorg89","9","1","2","12 October 2006"," Her Majesty Helen Mirren
","During the opening credits of Stephen Frears' The Queen, as soon as the title appears, Helen Mirren turns and looks straight into the camera. That look, and the sense of confidence it conveys, makes us realize she was the perfect choice for the portrayal of HM Elizabeth II (notably, she also played Elizabeth I in a TV miniseries).<br/><br/>Mirren's presence is fundamental to this film, which doesn't recount Elizabeth's entire life (that would have required a picture at least twice as long as Frears'opus), but just one crucial week which saw the monarchy at risk.<br/><br/>It starts with Tony Blair's victory at the 1997 elections. The newly appointed PM (Michael Sheen, who previously played the politician in Frears' TV movie The Deal) is sent to meet the Queen, in order to be officially given his new job. Despite his modern attitude (""Call me Tony""), he can't but observe old traditions when facing her. It is undoubted she has the power, as well as the people's trust.<br/><br/>Alas, that's not going to last, as one night she's told Princess Diana (seen in archive footage) has been involved in an accident, subsequently followed by her death. The whole nation is struck by grief. Not the Queen, who insists on staying in Balmoral, Scotland (the Royal Family's summer residence) until the fuss has died out. Only it doesn't. Everyone questions her attitude, claiming the ""people's princess"", as Blair calls Diana, doesn't deserve that kind of treatment. Even when told 4 people out of 7 think the monarchy should end, she remains adamant about her decision, with the support of her husband (James Cromwell), who comments on the events with the sardonic ""Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think we're mad!"".<br/><br/>Given the content of Frears' most known films (The Dangerous Liaisons, The Grifters), one might expect him to deliver a critique against either the Queen or the people. Instead, he prefers to show us both sides of the coin, justifying Her Majesty's behavior and everyone else's reaction. Furthermore, despite the subject matter, he envisages The Queen as a comedy, and delivers a film that manages to be funny without making anyone look ridiculous or geeky (even Blair, in spite of some antics, emerges as a real, likable person). The British humor is very dry (it's more The Office than Monty Python), and that's one of this movie's major qualities (if it has a defect, it would be the fact that it's merely 97 minutes long; another half-hour wouldn't have annoyed me).<br/><br/>However, The Queen would be nothing without Helen Mirren's towering turn as the English monarch. There is strong support from Cromwell (his remarks on Diana's behavior and his reaction at the announcement of Elton John's presence at the princess's funeral are among the movie's funniest, but also most poignant moments) and the spot-on Sheen, but it's Mirren who gives the film its heart and soul. Chances of her receiving an Oscar nomination ( it would be her third, after The Madness of King George and Gosford Park) are very high, and it would only be fair if she won too, since she truly deserves it. It's not likely we'll see a finer performance this year."
"cecdwarfer-1","8","1","2","12 October 2006"," An engaging look at personal life of the monarchy
","The events of this film will all be very familiar to the British public yet the story is still captivating due to the personal insight it attempts to give us into the private lives of the monarchy. It has a well researched and well balanced view of events being neither too critical or sympathetic towards the monarchy. Mirren gives a believable portrayal of the Queen and the supporting cast also fit well into their royal roles. There is a critical look at politics as it portrays the loathsome personality of Alistair Campbell, a man determined to exploit the Princess' death for maximum political gain. This film takes a close look at the way those in power must carefully manage their public relations or risk becoming unpopular or obsolete in the eyes of the nation. Overall The Queen is a treat for those with a keen interest in the historical tradition and future of the monarchy."
"malcolm-knott","10","1","2","6 October 2006"," Superb dialogue
","The interesting thing is that by the end of the movie we feel better about both Blair and the Queen. They have both been doing their best, as they see it, at a very difficult time. Who knows how true to life this was? But the screenplay, and especially the dialogue, seems authentic, which is what matters. The decision to keep the young princes out of the picture entirely showed good judgement. The supporting roles generally work well, although I suspect Charles took a rather more active role than the script suggests. The Queen Mother's fondness for a drink and the Queen's less than close relationship with her sister are skilfully hinted at. We sympathise with Prince Philip's exasperation at Diana's notorious television interview. The private secretary, in fact all the members of the household, at Balmoral and the Palace, are utterly believable. Two very small incidents, one good, one not so good, stick in the memory. Good: the Queen's mild surprise when Blair actually kisses her hand (it should be a merely formal touching). Not so good: the Queen tells a member of her staff, ""I used to be a mechanic during the war."" Her staff know this, of course. She is telling us (the audience) not them. But I must not nitpick. This was a truly excellent film."
"tgtround","10","1","2","6 October 2006"," A Great Film About An Extraordinary Week
","No one above the age of about five in 1997 will forget the week that Princess Diana died. Never outside war time has Britain been in such an obvious state of collective shock. Whether you feel that this event was absurd (as some including myself do) or not you can't deny it happened.<br/><br/>Stephen Frears has chosen to dramatize that week to question the role of the monarchy and it proves to make a brilliant film. I personally think that the most impressive portrayal is of Tony Blair - the youngest Prime Minister of the 20th Century at the peak of his political grasp and influence. The film does not hesitate to underline that this was a rare occasion when a politician really understood the public mood and was rightly commended for his leadership.<br/><br/>The other major portrayal - of our Captain General Queen Elizabeth is very good but I don't think Helen Mirren is really stiff enough! She's just a bit too twinkly eyed to successfully play a woman who has been guarded in public for 50 years. Anyone doubting this should watch the footage of Rolf Harris painting her portrait - vanilla ice cream is less frosty."

","The Queen is a very beautifully made film with a real feeling of ""Englishness"" about it. Helen Mirren plays Elizabeth II wonderfully and all the cast are believable (apart from Cherie Blair's in my opinion). The use of original footage from princess Diana's funeral and life leading up to her death are used well and not just to fill in the gaps where many writers would've been stumped as to what to have the characters say next. The script itself was also very believable, although at times it did make Prince Charles seem a little wimpish - he may well be for all I know! All in all, a very interesting and insightful film shot very elegantly. Helen Mirren deserves a least one award for this!"

But well, she's not (our grams). At the same time, kinda ridicules the Blair couple.<br/><br/>And the thing about doing biopics about living people is that everyone knows the real characters and expect physical similarities. They done an excellent job with Helen, she's Elizabeth totally. Prince of Edinburgh is as near as possible. But Charles is so wrong, so so wrong. The Queen Mother looks like a maid, not good as well. And Blair...oh God, he looks like Mr. Bean! <br/><br/>But at the same time, he appears as the hero that convinced the Royalty to do a public ceremony, instead of a private one. Clown or hero? Hard to tell the view of the script.<br/><br/>And the press is seen as the killer, indeed (the Queen Mother makes a joke about killing a photographer). As i believe it was an accident, i can't like this view. Strange to see real footage mixed with the movie. Not sure what to think of that. It seems like yesterday that i stuck in from of the TV watching those news...<br/><br/>Political's opinions a side (whiether the Queen is first the Queen and then mother and grandmother or the reverse, as the movie describes), i think the movie should have been about Princess Diana.<br/><br/>The People respects the Queen, but loved the Princess"

It looked like it would be cutting-edge, tense, scathing, and relevant. It was none of these things. Like the dreadful ""United 93"", it seems like a pointless, shameful exploitation of a recent tragedy in the name of making a buck. I'm not a big fan of the monarchy, but the writers here took massive liberties in depicting the royals as callous, cold and detached in the aftermath of Diana's death, even though they very well could have been. It seems to me very unfair to essentially have made up words put in one's mouth, particularly when dealing with such a delicate family matter. The movie itself plays more like a ""Made for TV"" movie. Were it not for some sweeping panoramic views of the Scottish Highlands and world class hype, I think it wouldn't have made it beyond television. Well done to Helen Mirren, who was spot-on as the Queen. The Tony Blair character did a pretty good job. But they were basically impersonations.

","I could not think of a less appealing subject matter than a royal biopic ‚Äì even if it is paired with one of my favorite themes ‚Äì the inability to show emotions ‚Äì so the fact that The Queen is able to keep my attention and interest at all is a small victory in itself, but I've seen it twice now, and overall, it doesn't do much for me. It is dryly amusing and competently made but it feels impersonal (and not just in the way that fills a thematic purpose) and like a TV movie in the blandest sense of the word.<br/><br/>The film is unmistakably about the queen, but she is largely depicted through the juxtaposition with others; she comes across as overly strict and reactionary when contrasted with the casual and modern Tony Blair, who wears football shirts and talks of revolution. Similarly, Princess Diana, whose death is at the center of the film, serves as an antithesis, like in a good scene where Prince Charles (in a great performance by Alex Jennings) talks about how she was ""warm, physical, never afraid to show her emotions"".<br/><br/>There is also some interesting stuff about the queen doubting herself (""Something's happened. There's been a change, some shift in values. When you no longer understand your people, mummy, maybe it is time to hand it over to the next generation.""), and a sort of sunk cost fallacy that makes her reluctant to admit she has handled Diana's death incorrectly (exacerbated by the fact that she has too few naysayers around her). All this suggests that it is a critical film, but it never feels very biting. For one thing, it is a bit too merry and lightweight. For another, it is somewhat undermined by a sappy final act in which the queen is largely praised from all directions except Tony Blair's wife.<br/><br/>Predictably, there are a couple of good scenes in which emotions seep through. While the scene where Blair defends and praises the queen feels redundant, it is refreshing to hear someone yell for a change. Also, there is another good scene in which the queen breaks down and cries, with the back against the camera, as if she doesn't want to show it to us viewers even, while still suggesting that the lack of emotion is not due to a lack of capacity, but rather of the perception of what is appropriate for a queen."

","This could have been one astonishing movie had the script writers and the director the courage to deal with some of the subject lines that keep being just hinted under too much expected TV biopic like stuff. I will leave to other to comment whether the movie is pro or anti-monarchy, maybe it's just neutral in the good BBC tradition. The story of the week between Diana's death is a good opportunity for one film or more about the birth of the myth of Saint Diana, about the faith of the British dynasty and its adaptability and amazing survival into modern times, or about a dysfunctional family who is at helm or close to it in the monarchic democracy of today, but is as remote from its own people as like being on a different planet. It is only the last line of action that gets some decent treatment, yet here also the TV instincts of the director seem to prevail and the result looks a few inches too close to TV comedy, rather than to serious political drama. It is really a pity, we are left just with the superb act of Helen Mirren - here being for once an Oscar prize I believe was deserved - and all the other interesting movies that could have been are left for the future to come into existence."

","Princess Diana's death in 1997 would send shock-waves throughout the world and naturally no land was hit harder than England. As the public mourned, the royal family (led by Queen Elizabeth II, played to the summit by Helen Mirren) tried using quiet restraint in the hopes of letting a sad and difficult situation die away peacefully. However, the delicate situation leads to public disgust and disdain for the queen and her royal family as it appears they have no heart or emotion towards the ""People's Princess"" as newly elected prime minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) gets caught in the middle. Quietly mundane and dignified would-be masterpiece that serves as a quirky and interesting part of contemporary history and doubles as a window into one of the really more mysterious figures in the world today. Unfortunately, ""The Queen"" really tells nothing earth-shattering in the end. Mirren's performance is laid back, classy, and really under-developed....much like the real Queen Elizabeth II. One could look at her role as the stuff cinematic legends are made of or what ""Saturday Night Live"" parodies are made of. Subtle and deliberate simultaneously, Mirren's role is the real subject of interest in a film that has a distinct vanilla feel to it. 4 stars out of 5."

While my wife was in tears, I marveled at the fact that, apparently, Tony Blair does his own dishes.<br/><br/>Plot and characterization in this one are more for historical interest than cinematic enjoyment.

She knows almost too well when to put power in mimic or tone, but you still capitulate. Sheen's performance as Tony Blair is in fact nearly on the same level.

","I saw this over the holidays and I consider it my best outing at a cinema in at least five years. I wasn't made to feel disgusted with the human race and I actually learned something. It is all the more surprising since Stephen Frears has made a specialty of portraying the working classes, if not the lower depths of humanity and his latest venture (""Mrs. Henderson Presents"", a nudie musical starring Judi Dench!) was a total and abject misfire.<br/><br/>I am a Canadian so Elizabeth (Elisabeth with an ""s"" in French) is my Queen, even though French Canadians are not reputed to love her. I appreciate that she actually speaks better French than most of our our prime ministers. And I have always felt personally sorry for her during the death of Lady Di fracas, a humiliation she never deserved. This film demonstrates with fictitious means the opinion that she is not only a very special human being but also the best queen England has ever had. Helen Mirren's interpretation is utterly convincing and probably inspired by months of study of Elizabeth's footage in the 1992 BBC cin√©ma-v√©rit√© documentary ""Elizabeth R"" (not listed on the IMDb and not available on DVD), which is still the definitive document on the Queen's real personality.<br/><br/>I found the whole experience simultaneously overwhelming and respectful, intricate in its details and nuances and somewhat poetic. The stag episode, especially, shows that she has subordinated her lifelong love of animals and much of her personal likes and dislikes to the dictates of tradition and the royal family's male obsession for the hunt. It also gives her a rare occasion to get in touch with her own feelings concerning mortality and Di's passing away.<br/><br/>Lady Di comes off as a floozy who played with fire by courting the medias (and was eventually destroyed by them) but was also a good mother, which is how it should be and the best way to remember her. Tony Blair comes off as a cynical but juvenile opportunist/upstart who still has a few hard political and life lessons to learn. I won't even mention how his wife is portrayed; she is probably the only character in the film who would have reason to sue the filmmakers if not for the fact that it all probably happened exactly as depicted."

The nuances particularly with the Queen beginning to shed some tears while her vehicle is stranded in the river, and then the fateful appearance of the 14-point buck, the Queen declaring it beautiful, then the gunshot--and I won't tell you the rest. The subtlety of the screenplay here depends partly on what level of consciousness the viewer brings to the film. There is so much there--and more--which would be clearer with a second viewing. Clearly, the Queen is experiencing an epiphany of some sort at the river, but does she suppress her emotions later? Also the fact that we never see the faces of the two Princes, William and Harry, is crucial to the tone and tenor of the film."

Almost every character is given their side or opinion, and none of them are made to seem in the wrong. The Royal Family wanting to keep the whole matter of Diana's death as quiet as possible, for the sake of dignity and the two princes, and New Labour wanting to go with the public opinion, make an event of it, and use this as a chance to modernise an institution many feel is archaic. At one point Prince Phillip points out that Diana was two totally different people; to the Royals she was the mother of the future King of England, an ex-wife, adulterous (come on, is Charles Harry's father? Look at him!) and a complete embarrassment. Even Blair states at one point she ""seemed to spend 24/7 trying to bring down everything they hold dear"", but to the public she was a saint, Princess of Hearts (God I hate that phrase) charity worker, a martyr of the establishment and each side could not understand the others point of view.<br/><br/>And it's here that the very heart of the film lies, in managing to portray the very heart of British society, this combination of tradition and modernization. What made this time so striking and resounding was that it starkly highlighted these two aspects and brought them to a point where it almost seemed that one would overcome the other. For what seemed like the first time the Queen did not understand her subjects wishes for her. The Queen has her family telling her that she is totally right to act the way she does, tradition dictates it. Tony Blair has members of his party, lead by the one character who seems to have no redeeming features, Alastair Campbell, who see anything that make the party look good should be used to full effect.<br/><br/>The actors are amazing, mainly because they seem to have avoided trying to do impressions of those they portray and instead act the characters. Special mention has to go to Michael Sheen as an excellent Tony Blair. (Am I the only one who really sees a physical resemblance between the young Tony Blair and Alan B'stard?) Sheen has captured the exact voice and mannerisms of the PM, and manages to portray both the ambitious, successful politician and a man incredibly nervous in the job he actually has to do, realising in this crisis exactly how hard it will be to balance everything together, slowly realising what it must have been for the Queen for over 50 years.<br/><br/>But, of course, this is totally Helen Mirren's film. Her portrayal of Elizabeth is perfect, showing us behind the woman who everyone claimed had no heart, merely being a woman in a time beyond her generation who is facing the fact she is not as in touch as once she was with the feelings of the public. A person who has done a job for nearly half a century as best she can, given her life to her country, and suddenly find herself the focus of public hatred. Having to take advice from a Prime Minister who hasn't been in office 6 months As she points out to Blair towards the end; enjoy you're popularity, as one day the public will turn on you just as they turned on me.<br/><br/>This may only be based of real events, and we don't know if this is how events really went, but in this film we have a portrait of modern England, the internal conflict that makes the country was it always has been, and something that puts human faces on those we never see as people."

","If there are really spoilers in this review, it's hard to tell. We already know the overall storyline. Even so, I checked off the spoiler box just in case.<br/><br/>I met Stephen Frears, the director, last year while he was promoting ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"". He was filming ""The Queen"" at the time. I am delighted by how deftly he handled such different material.<br/><br/>This story is a fictional explanation of why the royals, Tony Blair's cabinet, and the press reacted as they did upon the death of Princess Diana. It is not a critical look; rather, it is a ""fly on the wall"" perspective and, oddly enough, is very sympathetic and forgiving to all concerned. It had me in tears several times.<br/><br/>If there is any argument made in the piece, it is that the royals must abandon their distance from the people if the monarchy is to remain relevant and, perhaps, continue at all. Diana, the people's princess as Blair called her, demonstrated how much the royals can positively affect people by making continual contact. Distance subjects them, instead, to misunderstandings by the public, criticism by the press and public for perfectly reasonable responses and, in this particular case, and calls by the commoners for an end to the monarchy. And yet, accessibility got one of them killed by the paparazzi. It is a paradox, and Frears is not afraid to explore it.<br/><br/>There are some historical twists I did not know, and I'm glad the film embellished them. It is strange to imagine that Blair's wife is so pro-Republic and anti-monarch and he was still elected Prime Minister by the Labour Party. The contrast is stark between how the Blair's and royals live. As an American, the deference shown to the Queen simply turns the stomach. It angered me that the elected Prime Minister had to receive a blessing and permission from Elizabeth to form ""her"" new government. It was sad how she dismissed Blair initially as one of the ten other prime ministers who ""sat in that chair,"" opposite her, the first being Winston Churchill. And yet while she was so critical of the PMs in general, she later walks by a marble statue of Churchill in Buckingham Palace. Nice touch, Frears. Nice touch.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing short of brilliant. Helen Mirren wins the Academy Award and BAFTA right now, if you ask me. Oddly enough, I saw the film ""Calendar Girls"" this week on BBC America. To see Mirren go from that role to this doesn't just demonstrate her range and skill. It shows that she inhabits the personage of the character she conjures. The difference in how she played Elizabeth I earlier this year on HBO and Elizabeth II in this film is stark, demonstrating how deeply she plumbs for the meat of her characters.<br/><br/>I could talk about the other actors all day. Being a BBC America addict, I am convinced there is something special about England's acting programs that makes their portrayals profoundly superior.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this film. On a final, seemingly trivial note, the art direction is among the most detailed I've seen in years. Art directors Matthew Broderick and Franck Schwarz didn't just dress the set with meaningless nicknacks. The props, especially the paintings and drawings by Blair's children, comment on the characters and events in the story, much like a silent Greek chorus. On several occasions Blair walks by a child's painting of Picachu, the Pok√©mon who defeats adversaries with his, shall we say, ""lightening"" personality. It's an interesting comment on Blair's personality. And that, friends, is a sign of great film making.<br/><br/>Enjoy. I did."

","I only went to see this movie because of my deep admiration for the great actress Helen Mirren. I certainly weeped many tears because of the death of Princess Diana nine years ago. I had no need to re-open the still stinging feelings surrounding her tragic demise. And so when the movie ended, I had a feeling of being sullied, a feeling still with me almost 24 hours later.<br/><br/>I certainly do not know what could have possessed Mr. Frears to put his hand in this work. If the paparazzi are villainous to the point of murder regarding Princess Diana, then Mr. Frears and producers are equally guilty in using this material to cheapen her memory and profit on her terrible misfortune. It is to the credit of Miss Mirren, however, that this monstrous type of ""TV"" entertainment, didn't collapse on the weight of its presumptions. This is nowhere anything akin to great ""cinema.""

","When celebrity, family, and majesty collide, who will be left standing?<br/><br/>And it is with the terrible collision that abruptly ended the life of Lady Diana that the story begins of the worst crisis in the British monarchy since before the War.<br/><br/>That story is revealed in the Stephen Frears film, 'The Queen,' in what feels like quite a faithful dramatization of those real-life events.<br/><br/>At the start of the film, we fear we've been dropped into one of those quick-cut MTV-style Euro films which machine-guns us with over-saturated edits like 'Crank,''Snatch,' and 'Millions.' But after this rough start, thankfully, the story takes over and is told in a brilliantly concise ensemble performance headed up by Helen Mirren as QEII and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Not a note is missed through to the end of the film after this screeching start.<br/><br/>Scarcely does one encounter a film that resists the temptation to take that bait which might endear itself to a wider, dumber audience, and joyfully, 'The Queen' is just such a film. By telling the WHOLE story, the present film redeems not just Diana, not just the Queen, but to my mind, Western society in general ¬ñ and at a time when it is gravely needed. 'The Queen' also wonderfully reacquaints us with that oft-maligned magic of just being British and does so in far better a fashion than any new James Bond genre ever could.<br/><br/>Shortly after Tony Blair is elected Prime Minister of the UK, the movie recounts, he is faced with the daunting task of playing middle-man to Queen Elizabeth II and her subjects in the wake of Diana's untimely death. Diana was divorced from Prince Charles when she died and participated in royal life only when mothering her sons.<br/><br/>With the notable exception of Prince Charles, the reaction of the royals to Diana's death, the film shows us, grows quickly to a level of indifference that verges on the monstrous. But is it indifference or dignity which steels the Queen and her court against the worldwide outpouring of emotion for Diana's passing?<br/><br/>When she goes out of her way to lovingly stroke the decapitated head of a favored deer, but rejects the popular vigil for the mother of her own grandsons, what is it we're witnessing? Wanton, pitiless, disdain? Those trappings of formality which infuse the royalty? Leadership in some form too antiquated for modern sensibilities to surmise?<br/><br/>A case is made for all three, but what this film does so brilliantly is leave it up to us to decide. Mobs of mourners outside Buckingham Palace complain into cameras that no flag hangs at half-mast on its flag-pole. But we learn that no flag is flown at Buckingham when the royals are not there (they reside at a place called Balmoral in the countryside when not in London, apparently). The crowd complains that the Queen won't come and console them. But we learn the Queen hasn't mixed it up with a crowd for any occasion since the War. Is Diana's rejection of Prince Charles causing the Queen to hold fast her pity? Or is it precedent which governs her heart? It is left to poor Tony Blair to translate the position of the pressing mourners and their defenders to the Queen and vice versa. In a truly dramatic climax, Blair must face the prospect of countermanding the ""Sovereign,"" a task anathema to any Brit assuredly. In this day when dignity and tradition seem to have been labeled obsolete and thrown overboard in favor of expedience and sympathy, watching Sheen's Blair handle his task should be required reading for any businessman, negotiator, diplomat, Westerner, or adult human being. Sheen's performance is absolutely perfect. By showing this white-hot diamond of a crisis from every angle, 'The Queen,' reacquaints us with what is good and noble in all of us and it respects us enough to divine these for ourselves.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Helen Mirren. What can be said? She utterly disappears into the role of Queen Elizabeth II and to my mind, an Oscar for best actress is a foregone conclusion. You will never see a role played more gorgeously or respectfully. It is truly, truly a stunner. Bravo!<br/><br/>This movie review by Erik Gloor"
"Paddy-49","8","1","4","15 November 2006"," Essential viewing for anyone who wants to understand the strange, dysfunctional British Royal Family.
","Stephen Frears' extraordinary movie ""The Queen"" is essential viewing for anyone who wants to understand the strange, dysfunctional, detached, protected, snobbish and misguided responses of the British Royal Family at the time of the sudden death of Diana, Princess of Wales in August 1997. That the Queen, after too many days of aloof disdain behind the fences of her remote Balmoral estate, eventually understood the mood of the people was in no small measure due to the persistence of her new Prime Minister Tony Blair. This was the honeymoon period of Blair and he was sure-footed in his reaction to the loss of the woman he dubbed the ""People's Princess"" and his wish that the Queen should come back to London to lead the nation's mourning eventually prevailed.<br/><br/>Peter Morgan's script and Stephen Frears' direction are as realistic as possible and some parts of the film are semi-documentary in style. The dialogue between the characters, both in the Queen's immediate family and in the rival court of Mr Blair is, of course, invented but it all carries the firm ring of truth. It will be a shock to the royalist to see just how awful some of the Royal Family could be ¬ñ the snobbish and insensitive Queen Mother, the bad tempered and dismissive Duke of Edinburgh and the diffident Prince Charles are chillingly well portrayed. Helen Mirren's performance as the Queen is truly astonishing ¬ñto such an extent that very soon into the movie you forget that this is an actor playing a role and firmly believe that you are seeing Queen Elizabeth herself. Mirren does not impersonate the Queen - she is ""The Queen""!<br/><br/>The film is more than a believable record of a week in the lives of the Royals and of the Prime Minister ¬ñ it makes some telling points about modern Britain ¬ñ the country that had just given the Labour Party a stunning victory after eighteen years of rule by the Conservatives. This is a Britain whose people are not prepared to accept what they see as inappropriate behaviour by anybody ¬ñ even their Monarch. When the Queen acted so ill-advisedly the people told her so. It is also a Britain confident enough to choose its own icons and quite obviously it preferred the real and fallible Diana to the stiff and remote royal family. This remoteness was well captured in the movie by Frears' clever use of the stalking of a stag as a metaphor. The hunting down of a beautiful wild animal is shocking not only because most of the British people would find the violent act an obscenity in itself, but also because the fact that many of the royals clearly enjoyed the ""sport"" showed how removed from ordinary life and values they were. Whether Stephen Frears also meant the hunting of the stag to be symbolic of the hunting down of Diana I'm not sure ¬ñ but the senseless death of the animal seemed to move the Queen, and Mirren's performance at this moment allowed us to glimpse a more sensitive individual beneath her stiff upper lip external persona. One is reminded of Oscar Wilde's ""Yet each man kills the thing he loves"" in respect of both Diana and the Stag.<br/><br/>Diana's death was a learning experience for the Royal Family, but also for Tony Blair. He had to tread a difficult line between those in his immediate entourage with Republican leanings - who wanted to hang the Queen out to dry - and the reality of the British constitution which has the Queen, not the Prime Minister, as head of State. He did this well and listened more to the pragmatic and scheming Alastair Campbell than he did to his more strident wife Cherie. Blair's sure touch was eventually to desert him with his disastrous decision to support the United States over Iraq and one of the incidental aspects of ""The Queen"" is the reminder that it gives us of how much we lost when this skillful politician made such a ruinous error of judgement.<br/><br/>""The Queen"" is a serious film, but it is made with a lightness and sureness of touch which means that it entertains as well as informs. And in Helen Mirren's sympathetic but never obsequious portrayal of the monarch we can see what must surely be an Oscar winning performance."
"trubehr","10","1","4","9 October 2006"," Best in a long time
","This was a complex movie to pull off as the story of Princess Diana's death is still so sharp in our memories. The filmmakers are to be commended for their multidimensional HUMAN characters -- these portrayals gave this film the depth so many films lack. If you took away any biases you may still hold from that time when St. Diana ruled the covers of magazines, the film will give you a thought provoking looking glass - through which to reexamine that period without all the hype that overwhelmed us. The messages of the writer and the filmmaker are then allowed to come forward into our consciousness. The use of real television footage was brilliantly interspersed. It was clear that the Royal Family was (is)in their own bubble and yet the Diana they knew and the one the public ""thought"" they knew were two different beings --- they seemed to have reason to be bitter. The film once again showed that there are always two sides to every story and even though the Royal Family handled their side very badly until Tony Blair stepped forward to guide them back to humanity, ultimately they did make an effort. It may have been a shallow one, but frankly, that's the point. The deer scene says it all. To Steven Frear and the entire cast and crew - with special deep curtsy to Helen Mirren - WOW. Thank you for making the best film I have seen in so so long."

","I must be the last person on earth to see this movie. Saw it on Netflix and decided to jump in. <br/><br/>The story is established: Diana dies and the British go into more mourning than they did over the deaths of Winston Churchill or Freddie Mercury. OTOH, the Royal Family is saying ""what the eff"" is this all about. <br/><br/>Very slowly, the film follows the efforts of brand new PM Tony (""call me Tony"") Blair as he tries to nudge the royals into showing some public face of grief over the tragedy. <br/><br/>Helen Mirren is OK I guess as the queen. Really, who can judge whether her portrayal is accurate. It's a rare Mirren movie where she leaves her clothes on, but I guess that would have been gratuitous nudity. <br/><br/>You want to strangle Prince Philip, so that was a good portrayal b/c that is how you were supposed to feel. <br/><br/>The Blair character was nauseating, but so was Blair in real life so ""check"" on that one. <br/><br/>The dogs were good. <br/><br/>Well, now I can say I saw it."

","I absolutely loved this film. It was riveting and the performances were superb. Helen Miren is an accomplished actress and at times I forgot it was she impersonating the English queen and thought it was the queen herself. Those Windsors are a trip alright. They come complete with ice water veins, snobby brains, and hearts made of lead. With respect to Diana they obviously experienced a combination of a hereditary traditional instinct and simply plain old jealousy toward a woman who exuded love and received it from people all over the world. The Windors, none of them, could compete with that and are quite the opposite of it. It is a mystery why Charles, who perhaps showed at least a little bit of feeling and empathy, went for Camilla Parker Bowles and not for the captivating Diana. I suppose love is indeed a mystery. I was, though, enthralled by them as I tried to figure out what made them tick.<br/><br/>The concept of royalty is alien to most Americans although we do have reasonable facsimiles thereof. Still, English royalty is a different phenomenon. It simply makes me laugh. It is a mystery why the English still hold on to this vestige. I guess it is because of national pride, identity and a sense of continuity. These idle rich though have personalities like fish and cost the English people a fortune!"

Helen Mirren was amazing (as expected), but Michael Sheen steals the spotlight as a spot-on Tony Blair.<br/><br/>The underlying theme of this film is 'tradition vs connection in a modern world', and it super-cedes Diana's death. By the end of this film, The Queen, Tony Blair, and the English people represent three different generational viewpoints. The death of Princess Diana represented the intersection where royal traditions of the past were confronted by changing social values.

","The Queen is a perfect performance by Helen Mirren. No one could have done better, and very few could have done as well. The direction and production values of the film are impeccable, and the script is right on the money. Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is very good as well. There was not a dull moment in the entire film about the ambivalence of the royal family toward Diana. The public loved her far more than her cheating husband, Charles. And the disdain by Prince Philip and the Queen only added to the fuel against the monarchy in England. It was only through the efforts of Tony Blair and the eventual coming to her senses of Queen Elizabeth that the monarchy did not suffer further damage. This is a performance that one should not miss. How ironic that a woman who loved animals so much, actually enjoyed hunting them down and killing them as well."
"Lechuguilla","8","0","1","11 December 2017"," ""Let's Keep In Touch""; ""Yes, Let's""
","The film plots the response of the British royal family to the death of Princess Diana in a car accident in 1997. Tension focuses on the idea that, in contrast to the general public, the Royals didn't much care for Diana. In one scene, Prime Minister Blair (Michael Sheen), in tune with the public's mood, talks on the phone with the Queen; they're discussing how the monarchy should respond to Diana's death. After a tense and difficult conversation, Blair concludes by saying: ""let's keep in touch"". To which the Queen, in an icy voice, responds curtly: ""Yes, let's"", then hangs up. ""The Queen"" is a good movie.<br/><br/>In the film, the Queen (Helen Mirren) comes across as dignified, disciplined, confident, unemotional but brooding, perceptive, stoic, and fond of protocol and tradition. Blair comes across as informal, perceptive, jovial, and easy to relate to. Differences in their personalities are blatant and obvious.<br/><br/>In addition to a delicate script that zips along at a good clip, the film's production design is terrific. Though palace interiors are probably tacky in comparison to what the real British palaces must look like, the film crew does a fine job with the budget they had to work with. Ditto the credible costumes. Cinematography is fine. Casting is ideal.<br/><br/>A couple of concerns keep the film from being really great. There's a bit too much screen time spent on the ""stag"" hunt in the North. And in those scenes, I wouldn't have thought that the Queen actually drives a car herself, or wears a scarf. And second, and more important, you get the feeling that the film was made in direct response to the death of Diana; otherwise, the film would never have been made. If that's true, then it's Diana who is the real story here, and the title is thus a tad disingenuous.<br/><br/>Despite my problem with the film's reason for being, ""The Queen"" is a fascinating drama. Helen Mirren's understated performance is wonderful, and boosts the overall quality tremendously. It's a film well worth watching."
"Kingslaay","Null","0","2","25 June 2017"," Nothing more than a historical account of some of the darker days of the Queens legacy
","The Queen made a promising start but as time went on and each event or milestone was portrayed it lost its film appeal. It felt more like a BBC documentary special rather than a feature film. Ironically the use of archive footage from the news stations acted to affirm that idea. As tension mounts later in the film over the Crown's inaction the second half seems more like a chore than a film to enjoy. The beauty that lies in historical films is how the film delivers the finish or result even though you already knew the outcome.<br/><br/>The acting was first class and probably the strongest aspect of the film. Helen Mirren was very worthy of her best actress win as one never doubts that she is the queen and Michael Sheen did an excellent job as Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Queen is worth a watch but one shouldn't have high expectations. <br/><br/>7/10"

All great.<br/><br/>The sad events of the era, the death in very suspicious circumstances of Diana, and then the problems of how the royals react is all here.<br/><br/>A thought does occur to me, afterwards, that Blair's ambition to change and improve Great Britain seems to have been lost in the subsequent years.

","I have never been following the royal British family very closely, so I don't really remember how the situation was back then, in relation to the untimely death of Princess Diana. The actual reaction of the individual members of the family is difficult to assess, compared to the real history, but the overall reactions of the royal institution are spot on. This stubborn, old-fashioned, cold & cynical clinging to tradition and protocol that; inhibits the family from reacting like human beings is both outdated and outrageous. And it offends me grossly. <br/><br/>The queen, Elizabeth II, is shown as a woman, raised by these beliefs and hence very correct, and seemingly emotionally detached from reality. It is difficult to hold it against her though, when you look at the company she's in: married to Prince Phillip who almost aggressively protects these protocols, and the child of Queen Elizabeth I, a firm believer in the old-ways. The only one in the Queens family that questions these traditions is the Queens oldest son, Prince Charles. Regrettably the relationship shown between mother and son might just as well have been that of strangers. <br/><br/>The only one, (with the power to do something about it) that opposes of this system, is the newly elected prime minister, Tony Blair, who throughout the film tries to salvage the situation for the royal family.<br/><br/>The story is already well known, so the outcome couldn't be a surprise, but it still pleases me to see how the prime minister and his staff finally gets through to the royal institution, and how the Queen finally chooses to go against tradition, and partake in the public mourning. She redeems herself as a human being, showing a Queen in touch with her subjects, instead of the detached cynical woman showed first."

I thought Dame Helen Mirren did the best she could with the same pincurl wig they used on Emma Thompson in Saving Mr Banks. James Cromwell seemed miscast as Prince Philip and I'm not sure why there was no Anne, the Princess Royal, given she got married the second time in Balmoral. The star is certainly Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, as I saw him once in NYC and almost addressed him as the PM himself.

","Helen Mirren's complex and mesmerizing Oscar-winning performance anchors THE QUEEN, an intimate story told on a grand scale, documenting, in what could only be a blend of fact and speculation, the movements of the royal family, Queen Elizabeth II in particular, during the days following Princess Diana's death. Peter Morgan's uncompromising screenplay hypothesizes much of the Queen's thoughts and emotions during this difficult period as this story takes us into extremely private moments with the conflicted monarch of which no one could be privy, but basically, this story portrays the Queen as an icy and cold-hearted harridan who is curiously unmoved by Diana's death and does nothing to publicly grieve or acknowledge the Princess, who by this time, was already divorced from Prince Charles and had basically turned her back on the Royal family. <br/><br/>The film shows how Englanders' begin to publicly air their resentment of the Queen for her actions, or lack thereof, and her battle of wills with Prime Minister Tony Blair, who tirelessly advocated that the Queen acknowledge Diana publicly and what she had come to mean to the rest of the world as ""the People's Princess."" <br/><br/>Stephen Frears' bold direction does not sugar coat the screenplay, which doesn't necessarily paint the title figure in a flattering light, but puts a human face on this mysterious icon. Mirren's delicately nuanced performance is breathtaking and Michael Sheen (FROST/NIXON)proves to be a formidable screen presence in his interpretation of Tony Blair.

Like skilled actors, they recite them off teleprompters with artificial sincerity.<br/><br/>I remember Di's funeral, listening on the radio in my Quadra Island cabin in the woods, hearing the hooves of the horses in the funeral procession and the hush of a large crowd. I had no idea how large those crowds were or how upset everyone was, or how garish it all was, reminiscent of those balloon and teddy bear shrines at accident sites. To my ears then, the funeral seemed more a dignified occasion of state, something that should be accompanied by Purcell's Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary.<br/><br/>I was quite surprised at how unsympathetic a portrait the movie portrayed of the royal family. I did not expect something so harsh while the principals were all still alive. Even though the queen was portrayed as ice cold, dripping irony, you understood this was the way she was ruthlessly trained all her life. The only thing that matters to her is decorum, precedent and protocol. She is stuck in her stiff upper lip WWII role.<br/><br/>I tried several times in the movie to see Helen Mirren as she was in Prime Suspect beneath the makeup. I could not. She WAS the queen.<br/><br/>The extreme deference people show the queen, (e.g. backing out of rooms where she is present and bowing), and her fabulous wealth in lands I did not appreciate until I saw this movie, nor her intense sense of entitlement simply because she held the office of queen.<br/><br/>I agree with Tony Blair's wife. The monarchy is a archaic institution. It needs to be abolished. It is both unfair to force anyone to play this rigid role for a lifetime, and to give such extreme privilege to anyone based on an accident of birth. We should elect celebrities to play such ceremonial roles for limited terms."

","Film review of the movie ""The Queen"":<br/><br/>A nice combination of fiction movie and documentary is the movie ""The Queen"". ""That's how we do things in the country"" This statement by the Queen (Helen Mirren) describes basically what the whole movie is about. It is based on the real events happened after the death of Lady Diana, and deals with the behavior of the royal family especially that of the Queen, the criticism she got and her affords to modernize. The first time in her life the Queen gets into trouble due to her sticking very strictly to the protocol, instead of adjusting to her people's wishes. Modernization becomes a necessity if she doesn't want to loose her popularity and power. The movie starts with the election of Tony Blair(Michael Sheen) in 1997 as the Prime Minister. Tony is one of the main characters and is introduced as a very like able person. By his election he pledges to modernize Britain and has a quite negative attitude against the Queen and the whole royal family. He first brings up the question of modernization in the movie. With him being elected the people first showed their desire to a modernized country. The Queen is not comfortable with him as a new Prime Minister, but accepts him, even though she thinks of him as a young fool. It is very interesting to see how his attitude towards the royals changes over time, how he learns to understand the behavior of the Queen and learns to respect it. The Queen is a very important character too, of cause she is the one stumbling with her own attitude. In the beginning of the move she is very self confident and strong minted. Her values are: country first person second; and she rules the country and acts according to these moral values. Even though people accepted this for many years she gets criticism for it, after the death of her former daughter-in-law Lady Diana. She reacts not like people expect by going into public to comfort them but doing the complete opposite. She doesn't make any kind of statement and then joins her son and her grandchildren in Scotland. Within the movie there are two main parties build. The royals as anti-modernizers and the people around Tony Blair as the pro-modernizers. It is a very interesting development in the movie shown where both of them learn to understand and respect the each other. The Queen learns that it is modernization what her people want and that she as their Queen has to obey to this wishes, and the PM learns that the Queen is not as arrogant as he and his people suppose in the beginning. In the end they are both respecting each other, the Queen takes Tony's pices of advice more seriously and Tony doesn't judges her as much as he did before. To sum it up it is a very interesting movie that show the development of a slowly change in a country due to peaceful conversations and a caring and open minted Queen, but in some parts it becomes slightly boring due to long and repeatedly discussion scenes. It might be very interesting though to people who are interested not only in the historical aspect of these former events but also in the humanly aspect of it to persive a whole new perspective of it."

","The Queen is a 2006 British historical drama film directed by Stephen Frears, written by Peter Morgan, and starring Helen Mirren in the title role of Elizabeth II. The drama includes the death of Princess Diana on 31.08.1997, the reactions to it and the sojourn of the Royal Family at their summer residence of Balmoral Castle.<br/><br/>Even the prime minister Tony Blair pays tribute to Princess Diana. The Queen does not show her grief to the public, she also prevents Tony Blair's recommend to come back to London to reveal her sorrow. She does not want to hoist a flag to half-mast since it deviates from the protocol. Whilst Elizabeth II is venturing out alone in her Land Rover, she damages it while crossing a river, she has to call for help. The Queen feels a sense of frustration, but catches sight of a considerable red deer. She is stunned by his beauty. They stare at each other. When she is hearing a distant gunshot, she chase it away and decides to carry out Blair's advice. Then the Royal Family finally return to London. They look at the floral tributes to Diana. The Queen follows Blair's advice to make a public statement on live television, where she speaks about the life and legacy of Diana. She calls her as an exceptional and gifted human being. Finally, two months after Diana's death, Tony Blair visits Buckingham Palace to become a appointment with the Queen.<br/><br/>When the Queen beholds the red deer she is for the first time completely alone, she also exhibits for the first time her dolorousness. Her expressions are tinged with sadness. All the time of her life she learned to keep her feelings to herself, not show anything to the public, because she is the head of a state. She has to be proud and powerful. For this purpose the drama contains a memorable quote ""You must show your strength. Reassert your authority. You sit on the most powerful throne in Europe, head of an unbroken line that goes back more than a thousand years. Do you think any of your predecessors would have dropped everything and gone up to London because a bunch of hysterics carrying candles needed help with their grief? Huh! As for that silly Mr. Blair with his Cheshire Cat grin.."" (The Queen Mother) Therefore I think this scene reflects something that really happened in the ""real life"" queen's thoughts, beliefs and her behaviour.<br/><br/>In my opinion the drama is genuinely protracted but sometimes tedious and monotonous"

","THE QUEEN- FILM REVIEW<br/><br/>""The queen"" is a 2006 British historical film directed by Stephen Frears, written by Peter Morgan and starring Hellen Mirren in the title role of Elisabeth the II. First of all the viewer get introduced in film.The first scene starts at the queen's palace. There is a dialogue between the queen and one of her servants. It deals with the upcoming election of a prime minister and by this way the queen tells her servant that she envies him because he can vote and she cannot. After that you get to know Tony Blair, the future Prime Minister. He has his first meeting with the queen and he is very excited. Arrived at the palace one of the servants explains to Mr. and Mrs. Blair how to behave in front of the queen. Soon they arrive in front of the door, but Mrs. Blair first stays outside. Just the servant and Tony Blair enter the room and greet the queen as respectfully and with dignity as she deserves. Then the servant leaves and Tony Blair stays alone with the queen. Already in this situation it becomes clear that the queen is not really warm-hearted. There is a big distance between them and by her words ""I ask the question, Mr. Blair"" the queen clearly shows that she is superior. After a while Mrs. Blair also comes in and she presents herself towards the queen. After their leaving there are a lot of news about Lady Diana,ex-wife of Prince Charles. The director uses a lot of original videos and interviews of Diana to get the viewer very close to her life. Days pass and suddenly at night the phone rings at the palace. The royal family get the news that Diana has a car crash in Paris and that she is dying. In the morning there are a lot of news about that. So the whole world is very sad and shocked, they cannot believe it and soon they start to put flowers in front of the Buckingham Palace. People are really in a low mood for a few days. And in addition to that there is no public address by the queen. Only the Prime Minister Blair give a speech after Diana's death, but people expect a reaction of the queen. But she does not show herself and moreover you cannot see the flag at the Palace. As a result of that people get angry and disappointed. There is a big chaos and the newspaper articles are full of possible reasons and prejudice towards the queen's reaction. The days go on and after a car break in the wildness, where the queen has time to think about the situation she makes the decision deliver a speech about the situation. So the whole family go to Buckingham Palace and they begin to walk in front of the people looking at the flowers and letters to Diana. After her speech things get better. People forget their anger, but they cannot forget Lady Diana, the ""Princess of the People"". Finally the queen also feels better and she starts talking about business with Tony Blair."

","This is a remarkably well done and entertaining movie a comprehensive review of which I will leave to more accomplished writers. However, I was particularly taken by the manner in which the writer used the stag image, which I take was the turning point of his perception of the Queen. When she first sees this magnificent animal, she is transfixed. I fully expected her to immediately call her retainer and communicate her request to all land owners within the stag's natural range to protect ""her"" stag and to then have a confrontation with her fatuous husband. <br/><br/>By the writer's subsequent treatment of this scene, he condemns the queen to a harsh, uncaring person who cannot possibly be moved by her subsequent viewings of the people's flowers and faces outside the gates of her estate. The writer has thus squarely come down on the side of the Prime Minister's wife.<br/><br/>I flew B-17s with the 8th Air Force in WW-II. On my first pass to London I went to Westminster Abbey where a little old Londoner approached me and took me in tow, proudly showing me all the historic structures, his England, within walking distance although he obviously was a poor as a church mouse. At the end of the day, I offered him a pound note which he insisted on refusing. I thought, My God, the people represented by these building have been screwing my friend and his kind since the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, as the saying goes, and still this is ""his"" England.

","""The Queen"" tells the story of the aftermath of the Princess Diana murder, and explains how Queen Elizabeth II can handle all these situations, and how the murder affects the Royal Family and the whole world. Well, to start the review, Helen Mirren brings the performance of a lifetime as Queen Elizabeth II, and she brings a lot of charm and a lot of uniqueness to her character as this huge idol. But not just Mirren, but a whole other members of the cast were something to die for, with characters portrayed by glorious actors including Michael Sheen and James Cromwell. Stephen Frears' direction helped bring a unique spark by comparing a look at Princess Diana' flashbacks and how it has affected the Royal Family today. Peter Morgan's script was a special piece of writing that brought a lot of drama and magic. But at some times, the movie just felt hard to concentrate to, while forgetting a few major time-plots. But I still enjoyed the movie for its fine writing, special directing, and unique acting. ""The Queen"" is like a hand-written diary filled with memorabilia, and this felt like a movie that can compare royal life, and our daily life. ""The Queen"", in my review, ""a special feature, with a unique royal charm""."
"estebangonzalez10","8","0","1","18 August 2010"," Helen Mirren Overshadows Everyone in The Queen
","¬®That's the way we do things in this country, quietly, with dignity. That's what the rest of the world has always admired us for. ¬® The Queen will mostly be remembered for Helen Mirren's Oscar winning performance as Queen Elizabeth II which was just remarkable. She absolutely nailed the role of this widely known public figure and really captured her essence. Her physical resemblance with the Queen helped, but her mannerism and expressions were also outstanding. The only disappointing thing about her performance is that it overshadowed some other important elements the movie had. First of all Stephen Frears (High Fidelity, Dirty Pretty Things, The Grifters) did a great job with the direction which gave him his second nomination for best director, Michael Sheen was also excellent in his portrayal of Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the most important element of all that has been overshadowed by Mirren's performance was the screenplay that was beautifully written by Peter Morgan (The Damned United, Frost/Nixon, and The Last King of Scotland). Morgan wrote a very believable story about what happened inside the Queen's summer residence during the week of Princess Diana's death. The scenes felt very real and sincere and there were also several funny and clever lines as well. Morgan never takes any sides on the issue and gives a fair portrayal of what might actually have occurred on those days before Diana's funeral took place. I think he deserved a lot more credit then he actually got because he really did a great job researching for the story and made the film look more like a documentary than an actual fictional one. Helen Mirren's spectacular performance however makes it easy for us to overlook those elements.<br/><br/>The film begins with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) winning the elections by a landslide and becoming Britain's youngest Prime Minister of the century. Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) is watching the news on TV while she is getting her portrait drawn by an artist and regrets not being able to vote. The Queen isn't very excited about the new young Prime Minister, but they meet in Buckingham Palace and she makes the title official. The movie then jumps forward three months later when Diana suffers an accident in Paris. Real news footage is used for the movie covering the incident and we see how the Royal family receives the news in their summer residence in Balmoral Castle, as well as Tony Blair back in London. Blair's director of communication, Alastair Campbell (Mark Bazeley), writes a speech for him realizing that her death has had a huge impact in the world and that a live speech honoring her would be necessary. Blair's popularity rises even more after his great speech in which he calls Diana ¬®the people's princess, ¬® a title that has stuck with her ever since. The Royal family takes a different approach and decides this is a private matter and that no public speech should be necessary. Queen Elizabeth's mother (Sylvia Syms) and Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) aren't very fond of Diana and agree with Elizabeth that she is no longer a member of the Royal family. Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) on the other hand recognizes that the public will see them as the enemy if they don't empathize with their loss, so he asks Blair to try to convince her mother to make a public statement. The movie focuses on this dark week for the Royal family in which the tabloids tried to force the Queen to make some sort of statement, while she struggled with coping with her death privately and maintaining the Royal tradition.<br/><br/>The Queen is a very well written drama with some powerful performances and it is perhaps a very realistic portrayal of what went on inside the Royal residence during those days in which no public statement was made. Diana's death was a very memorable event for those of us who were alive during the time and we all remember where we were when we first heard the news. It remains a very memorable event in our heads and that is why it was so important for the movie to feel real, and Morgan's script contributed to that along with the performances from Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen. The scene where the Queen encounters the impressive stag was very powerful and serves as a great metaphor in this movie. There are several different views of what the stag actually represents, but I believe it represented royalty and how fragile it has become. The Queen identified with such a magnificent creature and realized that she would have to change her approach in order to survive. Blair was perhaps the only one from his office (even his wife, portrayed really well by Helen McCrory, was against monarchy) who identified with the Queen. The movie may only be remembered in history for Mirren's excellent portrayal of the Queen, but I think there is much more to it than just that.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","""The Queen"" is a story about the Queen. More specifically, it focuses around how she and Buckingham Palace handled the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana.<br/><br/>The film begins with the introduction of the new Prime Minister Tony Blair (well played by Michael Sheen) to Her Majesty (brilliantly played by Helen Mirren, in her finest work since ""Teaching Mrs Tingle""). In a surprise to me, this occurred just before Princess Di was killed, bringing the two figureheads into close relationship very quickly. The two have differing opinions on how to handle the aftermath of the tragedy and Blair soon finds himself needing to be very forceful to avoid the Royal Family becoming a target of scorn. Blair manages to convince the Queen, reluctantly, to make an appearance and a speech in order to save their reputation.<br/><br/>The film cleverly intertwines real-life footage of the events, most notably where the actors are ""CGI'd"" into original footage. The insight into the Royal Family is fascinating, and more so to the Queen (eg she drives a little jeep around the property). The cast is great, most notably the fore-mentioned plus James Cromwell as Prince Philip and Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair. I wasn't expecting much of the film, but really enjoyed the way it was done plus the walk down memory lane. It brought up lots of surprises eg that Diana was only 36 when she died and that the Queen knew how to drive a jeep and use a mobile phone.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing."

","Biographical films always prove a mixed blessing. For every triumphantly realistic (and often awards baiting) performance, there remains a certain cinematically stunted feeling, as if all concerned devoted so much attention to cramming in facts and details of the celebrity's life that the film adapts the feel of a ""greatest hits"" version of their life, capturing only selected fragments rather than a cohesive sense of the life or the individual in question. Bearing this in mind leads to a central reason that Stephen Frears' The Queen is such a triumphant undertaking. Rather than adhering to 'biopic' conventions and attempting to capture and condense the life of Queen Elizabeth into a two hour film, writer Peter Morgan selects a limited scope, concentrating on the election of Prime Minister Tony Blair, the death of Princess Diana and the subsequent media frenzy, and the Queen's role and reaction within them. This focus allows for far more depth, nuance and detail to be exposed within the film rather than the usual broad strokes and generalizations, superseding the common structure and making The Queen a fundamentally fascinating watch.<br/><br/>At first glance, given the above summary, the film being titled 'The Queen' might appear somewhat misleading, the central focus of the film being primarily dedicated to the re- creation of an almost unmatched media event through the reaction to Princess Diana's death and the political machinations ruminating on the relevance of the Monarchy in a contemporary context. And while the film begs investigation through the lens of its political and socio-cultural dimensions, it can just as easily be approached as a character study of its titular character. In terms of biographical representation, Frears and Morgan's in depth focus of a brief but essential period of her life provides a more telling representation of the Queen herself than any film attempting to cover a truncated version of her entire life could have resulted in. Morgan's fascinatingly complex screenplay fearlessly confronts notions which caused incalculable strife within the country and world in 1997 (and to some extent still do), recurringly focusing on the inescapable role of the media within contemporary government. This begs the question of whether the individuals in positions of power are running the 'people', or whether the masses in question are, by proxy, running their officials, as the public reaction to Diana's death sways the Queen's actions. <br/><br/>However Frears and Morgan are exceedingly careful to avoid political bias, simply presenting the events in a dramatic but detached fashion and allowing the audience to complete their own conclusions and judgments. That being said, interesting political parallels are pointedly drawn in reference to contemporary events (near the end, the Queen articulates Blair's attempts to build public support for her as out of fear that someday he might be in a similarly demonised position, to which she responds with a tiny smile, saying ""And you will""), making the film more shrewdly relevant than it might appear at first glance. However, the film's beautifully measured pacing keeps it, like its title character, moving along at a brisk, smooth and continually unflappable pace, intercutting copious documentary footage within the narrative to underline its historical relevance and credibility. The film is also enormously aided by its technical components. Alexandre Desplat's sumptuously grandiose musical score creates a powerful emotional undercurrent without ever once feeling excessive or out of place. Similarly, Affonso Beato's bold, sweeping cinematography adds life and vigour to a potentially overly static drama, with constantly gliding cameras adding a lyrical immediacy to the film.<br/><br/>Furthermore, being a highly performance driven work, the fact that the film never once lags or becomes less riveting is just as attributable to the cast's incendiary performances as Frears' masterful directorial pacing and Morgan's impeccable script. Helen Mirren, rightly awarded with a best actress Academy Award, is undeniably outstanding. Taking a character so inextricably etched as highly constructed, performative and unaccustomed to confronting emotions in anything less than a detached, quiet and dignified fashion, Mirren manages to bleed aching silent emotion, credibility and near peerless class from her without breaking stride. Mirren's Queen is never entirely sympathetic nor in any way vilified, but remains consistently a genuine human being, the slightest furrowing of her brow denoting decades of flooring experience and craft. Although the comparison might seem outlandish, Michael Sheen is almost equally superb as newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair, coming across as, eerily like Blair himself, winningly charismatic and sympathetic, yet with a minutely ambiguous exterior suggesting an underlying Machiavellian self-interest beneath the informal charm. James Cromwell also gives a fantastic performance, commanding the screen as Prince Philip, his gruff, unflinching adherence to tradition being poignantly contrasted with Blair's striving for modernity and change. Roger Allam makes powerful use of limited screen time as the Queen's chief secretary, with concern or heated contempt radiating seamlessly from his eyes alone despite a continually impassive, contained exterior. Helen McCrory is a strong presence as Blair's anti-monarchist wife, often articulating crucial truths beneath the public constructions of the principle characters, and Sylvia Syms delivers continual class and wry humour as the Queen Mother. <br/><br/>An uncommonly vivid and riveting watch, The Queen functions just as well as an exceedingly honest character study as a poignantly representative political drama and exploration of media presence and power. Fuelled by the exceptional performances by Mirren and the rest of the cast, Morgan's meticulously superb screenplay and Frears' masterful command of the cinematic form, the film supersedes genre conventions and the usual stilted tone, making for a fascinating, highly relevant and lasting watch. Even viewers usually distanced by such a film are highly unlikely to be disappointed, so accessible and rewarding an experience is The Queen. <br/><br/>-9/10"
"vandyke9491","9","0","1","12 March 2009"," The Queen - History Repeating Itself
","It must have been very difficult to make a film so well while basing it on recently remembered events. But there is nothing at all ""movie of the week"" about The Queen. Despite the misleading title, which would be better suited to a more complete biographical treatment, the film is expertly crafted to illustrate specific events in the history of the British monarchy. Actual news footage is interwoven with wonderfully written scenes to create a fascinating look behind palace walls during a time of crisis. This technique, combining the ""real"" image with ""imagined"" history simultaneously brings the audience into the center of conversations as they might have happened, which makes them appear quite realistic while also flashing before our memories images recycled from TV that we cannot forget, in new ways. We are re-orienting our own remembered interpretations of the actual past as we watch interpretations of history re-enacted. The mix successfully blurs the line between truth and fiction.<br/><br/>Amazingly, nearly all of the characters exhibit a depth and complexity that is generally absent from film. Forgoing the temptation to cast characters as either villains or heroes, familiar personalities in this film are given the luxury of expressing thought, holding genuine points of view and even exhibiting the capacity for growth. Most importantly, Helen Mirren is so convincing in the title role that although the actual Queen Elizabeth II is extremely well documented and presently with us, the portrait is so well drawn that the audience feels as if we have spent time in ""the presence"" ourselves. Surprisingly, none of the other characters- the Prince of Wales, Tony Blair, The Queen Mother or Prince Philips even remotely resemble their real-life counterparts in appearance. But there is not a mis-step to be found in any of the acting here, except perhaps one scene when The Queen may have walked a little too quickly for her age. But then again, the real Queen Elizabeth II remains quite active years after the events in this film."

","The most acclaimed British film of 2006 - it won the British Academy Award for Best Film and the Academy Award for Best Actress - The Queen is quite remarkable in that it is only the second time the living monarch has been portrayed on screen and the first time a serving Prime Minister has been portrayed in a feature film (discounting comic cameos from Margaret Thatcher in 'For Your Eyes Only' and 'Water'). Essentially, a modern day 'Mrs Brown' (another film about how the Royal Family coped with a Royal death and how the Prime Minister helped the Queen overcome public unpopularity), it provides compelling account of the week Princess Diana died in September 1997. The Royal Family stay put in Balmoral, cut off and remote and treating the death as a purely private family matter (the Queen initially refuses Charles use of the Royal flight to fly to Paris in the early hours of the Sunday morning of Diana's death). Meanwhile, in London, Prime Minister Tony Blair (a totally convincing Michael Sheen) is in the thick of public grief and instantly sees that the Queen's aloofness is damaging the monarchy. Peter Morgan's screenplay throws up revelations: the phrase ""people's princess"" was Alastair Campbell's, scribbled down on hearing of Diana's death; the TV broadcast made by the Queen on the day before Diana's funeral was Tony Blair's idea; and, according to Morgan, Prince Charles was very much on Blair's side.<br/><br/>I loved everything about this film, especially's Mirren's performance that is neither caricature or impersonation. Mirren gets under the skin of a difficult role - someone everyone knows as a public person yet know little about in terms of the private person. Alex Jennings makes a sympathetic Prince Charles.<br/><br/>Stephen Frears' spot-on direction never hits a false note. The film should be essential viewing on each anniversary of Diana's death."

A difficult task, given that this was based on a true story of recent history, with the monarch still living and indeed still at the thrown. Great story, well written, and beautifully shot and acted.

","Helen Mirren's complex and mesmerizing Oscar-winning performance anchors THE QUEEN, an intimate story told on a grand scale, documenting, in what could only be a blend of fact and speculation, the movements of the royal family, Queen Elizabeth II in particular, during the days following Princess Diana's death. Peter Morgan's uncompromising screenplay hypothesizes much of the Queen's thoughts and emotions during this difficult period as this story takes us into extremely private moments with the conflicted monarch of which no one could be privy, but basically, this story portrays the Queen as an icy and cold-hearted harridan who is curiously unmoved by Diana's death and does nothing to publicly grieve or acknowledge the Princess, who by this time, was already divorced from Prince Charles and had basically turned her back on the Royal family. The film shows how Englanders' begin to public air they resentment of the Queen for her actions, or lack thereof, and her battle of wills with Prime Minister Tony Blair, who tirelessly advocated that the Queen acknowledge Diana publicly and what she had come to mean to the rest of the world as ""the People's Princess."" Stephen Frears' bold direction does not sugar coat the screenplay, which doesn't necessarily paint the title figure in a flattering light, but puts a human face on this mysterious icon. Mirren's delicately nuanced performance is breathtaking and Michael Sheen (FROST/NIXON)proves to be a formidable screen presence in his interpretation of Tony Blair. Mention should also be made of James Cromwell as Prince Phillip and Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother, who also make the most of their screen time, but it is the bold screenplay and Mirren's artistry that make this film sing."

These three points achieve this movie to be a compelling drama despite its failed edition (at times it seems to me a BBC's television production) and some characters representations are little faithful to the original (as Prince Charles and Tony Blair), whose physically aren't the same.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on the death of Lady Di and its impact on the people of England as well as the royal family, but it is also true that what is most interesting isn't these consequences, most important results how the queen thinking and acting, so this intimate drama helps us to visualize perfectly a character emblematic of the current worldwide monarchy. Their feelings, concerns, the coldness with which she reacts to what her people want and the disjunction between pay tribute to the woman who attacked his reign or lose the acceptance of people but not betray their principles, all this make the interpretation of Mirren a faithful portrait of a woman who holds a great weight on her shoulders and still goes ahead, and that is what most impresses and impacted the viewer.

It was worth seeing for that alone.<br/><br/>James Cromwell as Prince Philip and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair also turn in very solid performances.<br/><br/>The Queen also highlights the peculiarities of the UK's semi-constitutional monarchy, and the inherent tension between Queen and Prime Minister, where Her Majesty (after ten Prime Ministers) can address the man with the nuclear trigger like he is a novice.<br/><br/>You really feel as if you are getting a peek into the weird dynamics and private lives of the royal family, as well as the more (relatively) ordinary lives of the Prime Minister's, in spite of his tremendous power.<br/><br/>This was the most striking film I have seen in a long time."

","Stephen Frears certainly did a fine job here with this very well and informative docudrama historical type film. As you watch and you as the viewer feel the pain and loss of Princess Diana from the actual highlights and flashbacks of actual news reels shown during the film. Yet Dame Helen Mirren leads the way with her performance as Queen Elizabeth II as her performance is tough and believable. The film shows the conflict of the public tragedy of the sudden death of Diana and the attitudes of traditional bound Elizabeth and new Prime Minister Tony Blair who wants a new modern image carries the film most of the time. True in it's nature you as the viewer see the private chambers of the Royal family and the British government as it's seen in it's darkest hour. James Cromwell also gives a strong supporting performance here too. ""The Queen"" is well blended as a film of government and royal conflict yet the flashbacks of Princesss Diana show the pain and tragedy that's lead to the conflict, really Stephen Frears blended it so well his direction is top notch it worked well with Mirren's life like performance. ""The Queen"" is clearly one of the better historical docudrama types of significant interest for any film and history buff fan."
"Dr_Coulardeau","8","0","1","7 April 2008"," Th week when the English monarchy faltered
","To confront the Queen of England, Tony Blair and the death of Lady Diana, the Princess of Wales, was dramatic at the time but has totally aged today. And the film has aged to. This big vignette, this enormous cameo in normal life that this week after the tragic end of a young woman was has become quaint, charmingly quaint but with little meaning left. During that week, or even that summer, the monarchy nearly fell in England but the Queen, though surrounded by too many people who were deaf and blind, managed to hear the piece of advice given to her by Tony Blair and she followed it and saved that monarchy. Is that what happened or not? That is not the problem. It is reassuring to believe it is what happened. But it is also important to understand that in today's world what counts is public opinion. We may think public opinion is looking for emotional and sentimental empathy instead of real deep inner grief. But this public opinion remains the yardstick with which we are to measure and determine our behavior. Apparently Stephen Frears wants to make us believe that Elizabeth II did feel and understand the necessity to accept that rule. Something of the kind surely happened. Yet the film is in no way transcendingly immortal. The best part remains Helen Mirren who is embodying a Queen that is superbly heart raking and soul moving.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","Fantastic. I thought Helen Miram playing the Queen was truly believable. I totally bought her performance. Mr. Cromwell as Prince Philip was another outstanding performance. truly on point. The Tony Blair character was another perfect match.<br/><br/>The only performance characters that I thought needed work was the Queen Mother and Prince Charles. The Queen Mother was much smaller in real life and much more older. And Prince Charles character, which was rather good in the acting department, I just couldn't get past his face. The television movie about Diane had a better Charles, who even looked a little like Prince Charles, they should of gotten him to play Charles.<br/><br/>The overall story line I truly believed. The Queen's determination to have a private memorial and ""keep it in the family"" was all due to her upbringing from her father and the 1000's of Monarchs before her. The scene with the Deer, was truly inspiring and I hope people understood the meaning of that. You see the Queen was grieving for Diana through the Deer and when it was killed by someone else - something in the Queen snapped and she became a ""Grandmother"" and not just a Queen and decided to share her grief with the world. It was truly fantastic. I watched this movie with my partner and we were both just transfixed on the screen and couldn't move until we really had to take a break - you know to eat, go to the bathroom, get ready for work the next day. I mean - it's a long movie - over 100 minutes. Anyway, after having ourselves a 1/2 hour break to get our next day's life together, we continued the movie (that's the beauty of DVD's) and watch the conclusion.<br/><br/>Brilliant. I have to say, my grandmother was invited and went to Charles and Diana's wedding all those years ago, my grandmother told me that she had never seem a more beautiful wedding in all her life, and she came back with lots of pictures that the public really didn't get to see. Diana was truly something else.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie - rent it. You will not be sorry."

","What an incredible comedy of manners and position this is. Yet it manages a conclusion which is touching. Diana dies. The British public (and many elsewhere) go into a genuine spasm of grief. The Queen (Helen Mirren) and the royals completely misread the situation and are determined to keep things private with no undignified displays of emotion. They are such a conventional, mundane family. Plus, of course, they detested Diana. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), newly in as Prime Minister, reads the situation correctly but has to find a way to bring the Queen to understand the seriousness of how the public is beginning to react to her remoteness. And it's all inside stuff. <br/><br/>The Queen is portrayed as absolutely clueless at first, a product of her upbringing, a captive of what she feels ""duty"" is. Emotionally, she is so closed in...so ""English""...that one can realize what a repressed childhood Charles must have had with a bully for a father and a mother unable to express love easily. Philip is not just a bully, he is full of blustering royal certitude. Charles is well-intentioned, more intuitive than you'd think and weak. Blair is irritatingly ingratiating but right. Cherie Blair, his wife, is an anti-monarchist with sharp teeth, an unpleasant piece of work. <br/><br/>It's a lot of fun."

","Many of us remembered the day when Diana, Princess of Wales, died. The woman who was being called 'the People's Princess' by the then-Britain Prime Minister Tony Blair. Her death had triggered quite a response in the UK and around the world. But how did royal family reacted? <br/><br/>Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) had been elected as the new prime minister of the country, and he had created history by being the youngest in the 20th Century to be elected to 10 Downing Street. Months later into his term in office, something happened which would shook the world. The Princess of Wales had died in a car crash in Paris. Almost immediately, the entire nation was in grief and it was evident in the newspapers' reaction to the princess's death. But somehow, there was no word or statement from the royal family with the media wanting to know what they have to say of it.<br/><br/>Chronicling the immediate seven days since the death of the People's Princess, The Queen goes behind how the Prime Minister managed to convince HM Elizabeth II on how to express her and the royal family's reactions to the death of the country's most popular monarch of our time. Royal protocol don't always work in modern times where people want instant reactions. A sad but true fact of the society of today.<br/><br/>What stands out for me is how Michael Sheen portrays Tony Blair. He is almost like the real McCoy. Helen McCroy as Cherie, the wife of Tony...the likeness is almost there. Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen herself had me almost convinced for a while she is the real thing."

Credit the screenplay and writer Peter Morgan,as well as Stephen Frears' direction with turning this film into more than a mere walk-through of familiar events,replete with emotion and instead a thought-provoking and balanced look at the often-maligned monarchy,particularly through the eyes of the figurehead Queen Elizabeth II(Helen Mirren,EVERY bit the part). She may be a steely,tough and perceivably dour sovereign,but she is very much the product of both her upbringing AND history,and she is also not unaware of how her people see her,and this conflict is quietly raging as the preparations for Diana's funeral ensue. <br/><br/>Anchored by Mirren's Oscar-winning(and worthy)performance,this simple yet intriguing movie runs at a somewhat surprisingly fast clip(just over an hour and forty minutes)is able to leave mark.

With movies like Die Hard and stuff like that you can always say, that you find the movie dumb and just eye-candy, but this is just not a silly movie with no meaning.

Basically you see The Queen Elizabeth II. for 2 hours answering calls, writing letters, seeing politicians etc.<br/><br/>After I saw the movie i summed it up for the fun of it as ""You know in those really exciting movies you see once in a while, there's got to be a scene where the two parties negotiate, and you might think that that scene slows down the movie. Well, 'The Queen' is two hours of exactly that scene""<br/><br/>So what I was trying to say with the title of this review is that you will definitely be moved by this movie if you're British or in general are linked emotionally with The Queen and Princess Diana. For those who cannot relate to that cult about these persons - like me - they probably won't be touched by the movie.

It depicts the amazing disconnect that occurred between the queen and the British people.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren was great as the bewildered queen and Michael Sheen was outstanding as the Prime Minister. I have no idea if the royal family is as nutty as was portrayed, but the performances were terrific. Each member of the family had their own unique and strange behavior. Perhaps the only character depicted as sane and full of life was the new Prime Minister Tony Blair.<br/><br/>Given that this movie only covers a weeks worth of time, it is amazing that it is able to tell an intense story and give insight to the characters involved.<br/><br/>This is a must see for anyone interested in the British royal family.

","Very surprising. I wouldn't have thought that I would enjoy this so much. A potential snore was made one of the best views of 2006 by the two protagonists, wonderfully played by Helen Mirren and the relative newcomer, Michael Sheen as Tony Blair.<br/><br/>The prologue, dealing with Princess Diana is ingenious. You are not really sure if you are watching a reenactment or archival footage of the paparazzi chase that would end in horrible tragedy.<br/><br/>Then we get a marvelous scene where Blair and his wife are waiting inside the Palace. Blair is to be sworn in as PM. We already know that he is not too keen on the monarchy and actually thinks that it's a bit of a joke from a discussion between him and his wife. As they meet we immediately sense that although Blair would like to say that it is him that's in charge, the Queen immediately puts him to shame, not by being bossy but simply being such by he empowerment.<br/><br/>Now we get to the real plot: How to deal with Diana's death and it is here the two personalities come to blows. And from then on it's Mirren's movie all the way. The Queen doesn't invite much sympathy but we start to understand her and why she acts like she does. When we finally get to the inevitable turnaround, we don't feel that Blair was more right because he finally won the Queen over, but we feel sadness because it really hasn't changed anything, except giving the people what they wanted.<br/><br/>The epilogue is a scene reminiscent of the prologue, where Blair acts as he knows how to deal with the Queen but in reality he knows nothing more than he did before.<br/><br/>The performances are all great and special kudos also to James Cromwell. He may be playing a totally foppish character but he does it brilliantly. Mirren's Oscar was totally deserved and Sheen almost channels Blair, even though their resemblance is only slight."

I was very young when Diana was dead and I could never understand why she was so important for the people, and now that I'm grown I see that she was loved because she was from the people and the closest one to the Royal Family. She could see that there was a hole between the people and the institution and she did what a sane and modern person (like she was) would do: work like a bridge between them.<br/><br/>As well said in the movie, Diana had 2 very different personalities: Diana as a family member and as a mother, and Diana as a visionary woman that found a way to show the people that her country was in need of some changes. But when the Royal Family could finally see that, it was too late.<br/><br/>All this is shown in the movie.

I know the film maker and all those involved probably put tons of energy and effort into it though, so don't take that as me saying it was poorly made. I will say that the direction probably didn't deserve an Academy Award nomination though.<br/><br/>Performance wise The Queen was played well from what I could tell though transforming appearances seemed to be the most impressive thing.

"diana-2","7","0","4","15 May 2007"," Great movie for what it is....
","Helen Mirren is absolutely superb. Let's just get that out of the way. But this movie sort of skims over the truth of the situation the Royals experienced with Diana. And it also skims over the truth about the Royals themselves.<br/><br/>First of all, I was truly upset to see the Queen and Prince Philip sharing the same bed. That is patently ridiculous, and it seemed to me that this was an embarrassingly glaring untruth known to all those involved in the movie. Everyone knows that that particular royal couple does NOT share a bed. I had read long ago that their children were conceived via artificial insemination. Theirs is definitely a marriage of convenience, a practice that is wholly accepted among Elizabeth's generation and before and which she definitely expected Diana to embrace. Poor, silly, Diana...she was actually looking for love in a royal marriage....what poor taste! One can almost imagine the queen looking down her nose at Diana for her ridiculous ideas.<br/><br/>All of Elizabeth's family have disappointed her in this way, so she must feel absolutely superior to them all.... Love in a royal marriage? How SELFISH! Above all, one must have an HEIR to extend the royal lineage!!! The British people must be frightfully fed-up with their society and the royals. One of the most telling lines in the movie is made by Tony Blair. Something like ""this country will never be a Republic"". That line truly gave me pause. Stupid me! I thought the place was really a republic.... I thought of how I experienced London when I visited several years ago. How truly important the distinction between the ""classes"" were, and how strangely male the country is.<br/><br/>One thing this movie did was to make me aware of how much I didn't know about Britain. How different Labour must be from the Conservative Party. How the royals must appear to their subjects and vice versa. What the emergence of Diana (""the People's Princess"") really meant to the British. Imagine a royal who actually cared about the people! Imagine a royal who talked about love! Imagine a royal who actually mingled with the people and held the babies of the poorest and sickest in her arms and kissed them. This must have really annoyed Queen Elizabeth and that little family we see on the screen. Writing this now, I see how isolated Queen Elizabeth had become and how a mistake like the one in the movie could slip by her... She has no feelings for her people. When Queen Elizabeth opines that things have changed...this is what she is talking about.<br/><br/>I was very interested in the item one reviewer here brought up. How a 14-point stag must be culled or risk starving to death. Now I see that this is similar to Queen Elizabeth herself. Tony Blair saved her from being culled and put her back in the zoo with the rest of the endangered herd.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it is hard to tell fact from fiction in this account of a week in the life of Queen Elizabeth II. However, it all made me want to know more about the royals.<br/><br/>And to the reviewer who looked at the past 1,000 years of British rule with misty eyes, let us all remember that the Kings of England were a bloodthirsty lot, killed their own family members with glee and in more than one case were definitely treasonous and caused their subjects great difficulty and suffering. Which is why they've been reduced to the state they are in today. It's no wonder many people think they had Diana killed....their family history gives this idea a leg up...<br/><br/>The movie is very entertaining and the players are wonderful. Helen Mirren deserved the Oscar, even though she plays Elizabeth quite a bit younger than she was at the time. <br/><br/>But the royals? Queen Elizabeth has been quite successful at keeping her family dynamics hidden. Despite all the media attention. I suppose we are all longing to know what the Queen wears when she is slopping around the house, and this movie does give us a few tidbits.<br/><br/>I must say...I enjoyed this movie. It's thought-provoking, as you can see!"
"lauraeileen894","Null","0","1","2 May 2007"," Hail to Helen Mirren
","Helen Mirren is magnificent and heartbreaking as Queen Elizabeth II in ""The Queen"". Playing the monarch during the week following Princess Diana's death in 1997, Elizabeth is straight-forward, unsentimental, old-fashioned and unflappable... which are the qualities that the British public (or, indeed, the world) don't want her to display during this tragic time. Elizabeth simply wants a private, tasteful mourning between Diana's family and her own. Yet the tragedy rapidly gives way to a frenzy of hysterical grief from the masses, and Elizabeth is torn between doing what is expected of her and doing what she feels is right. Stephen Frears expertly handles an extremely sensitive subject without becoming didactic or copping out. ""The Queen"" isn't about heroes or villains, but simply about people who must come to grips with their own feelings. Frears also shows us that there is more to Elizabeth than her stiff upper-lip mentality and backbone of steel. He shows us a woman who expertly drives a jeep through rocky terrains, who loves walking her Welsh Corgis, and who still turns to her wizened mother, the Queen Mother, for help and calls her ""Mummy"". Mirren is exquisite, but Michael Sheen deserves praise for his multi-dimensional portrayal of the then newly appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair. He plays Blair with an intriguing mix of adult experience and youthful eagerness, whose emotional struggles mirror Elizabeth's, albeit in a decidedly less subtle manner. <br/><br/>This is one of those rare films that actually live up to the hype. Long live ""The Queen""."
"walsh-22","7","0","1","27 April 2007"," I remember where I was when I got the news
","I will always remember where I was when Princess Diana was killed in Paris. Coincidently I was in London for my 18th birthday. I remember making up in the morning after my birthday and finding out she had died in a car crash, I was in shock and disbelief that it had happened and this is one event I remember very well especially the nation being angry that the royal family had not done anything, lowing the flag, coming back to London and not making a statement at all, about Diana. This is what the ordinary British public expected and they showed the emotion they thought the Royal family were unable to but what the film picks up on is they come from a completely different world to us, they have privilege but they have this scrutiny that goes with it where everyone is watching and if they don't do or say the right thing they are picked apart. I didn't grow up in the Queen's time so I find that I don't understand the Queen as well as someone who grew up in the same era would and this is what the film goes to, the Queen was brought up in a totally different mind set then people in my era, they kept their emotions in check,never showing them to anyone. She must have felt a range of emotions but she had to be the Queen to the country first so she had to stiffen up and let the punches bounce off her.<br/><br/>The film reconstructs the events of the week after Princess Diana was killed, it uses news footage from the BBC and ITV with the film's re constructions. It is unique as this is told from the royal family's perceptive. What I like about Stephen Frears direction is he shows the royal family sympathetically but he also shows the royals as they are and doesn't try to gloss over things that could show them in a negative way.<br/><br/>I will never agree with some of the actions of the royal family but I think they are strong people who are human but they have their own way of dealing with situations that would have other people running for cover, especially The Queen and I admire them for that.<br/><br/>The film is also about the relationship between the Queen and Tony Blair and the different approaches they have, Blair is modern and the Queen is seen as old fashioned.<br/><br/>It is also ironic to see Tony Blair at the start of his term who was very popular and who understood and correctly Gage the mood of the public and now he is so unpopular and all he will be remembered for recently is his discussion to bring us into a war with Iraq. It is a shame that this should be one of the things he will be remembered for. I think there is a joke between the film and the audience when the Queen turns to Blair and says he will be in the same situation she found herself in with Princess Diana and the audience being in the present can see she is right as we are at the end of his term and most of the public have been turned off from Blair and the Labour government who we now see as being exactly like the Tories were when they were in government.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful. They are subtle performances, that are not caricatures of the real people, they are just understated and not over the top like some actors portraying real people have done in the past. Helen Mirren as The Queen, James Cromwell as Prince Philip, Michael Sheen, Alex Jennings as Prince Charles and Sylvia Syms as The Queen mother just convince you that you are seeing the real people they are portraying and not the actors.<br/><br/>Special mention should be made to Peter Morgan for his writing, Film Editing by Lucia Zucchetti, Cinematography by Affonso Beato and Original Music by Alexandre Desplat.<br/><br/>The only negative things I will say is the film shouldn't have killed that stag, I was very annoyed as I don't approve of hunting and didn't feel it had any reason to be in the plot. The other thing is where did the writer and director get their material, what research did they carry out and how do we know the royal family depicted in the film is how they were in reality."

","The Queen is an interesting sort of film. It is basically a documentary told mostly in re-enactments, but brought to the next level by fantastic performances and high production value. There is no disputing Helen Mirren's total embodiment of the title role. She is captivating to watch. The narrative style, focusing on the Queen's perspective and highlighting her vulnerability, is also quite good. The problem I had with the film, which I'm sure was an unavoidable challenge in making it, was with the supporting characters, who oftentimes looked to me like celebrity impersonators. This is not a criticism of their acting abilities, just a belief that it was a no-win situation in the making of the movie. In a time when we are used to seeing actors portray celebrities and political figures in comedy like Saturday Night Live, it is a natural response to laugh at fake Tony Blair, fake Prince Charles, etc. Or at least be a bit distracted by it."

"polar24","7","0","1","21 February 2007"," An exquisite portrait of the charming Queen in a defining moment of our generation
","Is the Queen still necessary today? In ""The Queen"", Frears paints an unflattering picture at times, and maybe candidly unsympathetic portrait of HMQE2. She is shown as a cold, resolute and inflexible mother, grandmother, wife, and daughter, trying to lead the country with traditions that are becoming stale and archaic. In one week, her popularity and status has never been under more scrutiny in today's society.<br/><br/>It charts the infamous period in English history beginning with Tony Blair's remarkable accession as the Labor Prime Minister in 1997 to the shocking death of Princess Diana that unprecedentedly brought the nation, and the monarchy to a standstill. The events are interspersed with some amazing news footage of the palace and the public at the time, the vividness and striking quality of these clips resonate so deeply with those of us around at the time that the surreal events only feel like they happened yesterday. This was a defining moment of our generation.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully furnished, filmed on location in the palace and surrounding English streets including No.10. The Scottish highlands were also sweepingly picturesque, the stand-out a fantastic helicopter shot over the rolling hills capturing the hunt for the majestic stag. Frears does a good effort directing, finding some unique angles within the palace, maintaining the suspense of the film throughout, and taking the time to showcase Mirren's fine talents.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic all round with Mirren leading the royal procession as the haughty and detached majesty seen by the public, but underneath her layers, a tenacious and pragmatic mother of the people who reminds us that even our leaders must be led sometimes. She commands a performance of restraint and economy, allowing us deep into her public fears with a simple shift of the eyes or in the intonation of her crisp delivery of English wit. Tony Blair, Prince Philip, and The Queen Mother are also all startlingly realised in multidimensional characterizations that demonstrate their futility, outrage and rejection of the collapsing of the idea of the monarchy. Both their physical and emotional attributes have been translated superbly to the screen. Each actor captures each members of the family's spirit and their characteristics without resorting to banal trivialisations or shallow caricatures.<br/><br/>The script written by man-of-the-moment Peter Morgan is bursting with the dry English wit that is so subtle but punishing when well delivered. It assumes nothing and yet has much to say about the break-down between the Royals, the people and the 21st century. The smart delivery and meditations on modern government also make some realisations about biting that hand that feeds you. Plus there are some great deadpan one-liners throughout. The score by Golden Globe winner Alexandre Desplat is sweet and charming yet hints at the peoples' taking over of power. There are also some splendidly sensual and voluptuous passages that reflect on the Queen's state of mind during the film.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film. The incomparable Helen Mirren in a superb majestic role. Queen Elizabeth 2 herself has always enchanted me and I was expecting a mature and refined drama about one of my favourite historical figures. Plus the film has an exquisite beauty. But perhaps I was expecting too much. Mirren, while breathtaking didn't elevate me to soaring heights and the characterisation was a little too harsh. QE2's charismatic and can-do personality, her efforts in the war, tribulations with former PMs and her relationship with the parliament deserve not to be overlooked just because she had a moment of poor public judgment. And I felt all her achievements in the name of England were overlooked in preference of making the Queen look like an prehistoric, dogmatic old bat. She was a very elegant and pretty young woman in her time and at 80(!) is in superb health and looks for her age.<br/><br/>In the end, I also felt it was a little too ""telemovie"" and not critical or salient enough to demand forceful passion from the viewer. Still well deserved Oscar noms and probably wins; a pleasure to see unique and vivid portrayals of the Queen and her family too easily dismissed as a bunch of stuck-up Royals. Long live The Queen!"

","Ten years ago, after the death of Diana, the monarchy was faced with a situation where for the first time they felt the power of the common people fly in the face of protocol. This movie - superbly written, crafted and performed - is another step towards humanising the monarchy.<br/><br/>The movie - which intersperses actual footage with some brilliant performances by Helen Mirren as the Queen - has captured the complexity that it is to be royalty in the UK. There is a growing body of opinion amongst the people that the royalty really is an anachronism (the life of opulence and luxury in the day and age when everyone pays their own way). The concept of entitlement does not go down well.<br/><br/>However this movie reflects the other side as well. That royalty feel they have to take on sacrifice in the line of ""serving"" the people. In short, god's duty.<br/><br/>I will not raise the issue - however I will say that this movie is a must-watch. It is very well edited to keep a taut and tense feel about it -very cleverly using real footage to move the story along."

I was amazed at some of the simplicities and down to earth realities of the culture and felt a common and familiar feeling with the emotions portrayed by all persons involved.

I truly believe that Philip and Charles are nit-wits and that is HRH that takes total responsibility in the decision to abandon Balmoral and fly to London.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren is wonderful in the role of Elizabeth II, and Tony Blair diplomacy finally sets an example of diplomacy, at the same time taking correctly the public opinion pulse. She, no doubt, deserves an Oscar for this outstanding performance.<br/><br/>A scene deserves my comment. When the Queen is in the gate in Buckingham Palace and the child gives her the flowers.

"demf","8","0","1","12 February 2007"," Great performance by Mirren... but a bit puzzling...
","In this film, Helen Mirren is just plain EXCELLENT as Queen Elizabeth II, but the sense I get from her performance is that she portraits the role as realistically as possible, while her dialog is, from a psychological and emotional point of view, incongruous with her mannerisms and the events she portrays on the film. In other words, she acts one way, but her lines suggest some other course of action... I guess that the WRITING is to blame. We have no way of knowing, of course, how close Mirren's lines are to how the real queen of England behaves: if she's as arrogant, conceited, etc. as the lines Mirren reads, then the script is a triumph, but her acting gives the queen a true human perspective, a woman torn between her life-long duty and institutional stuffiness versus the aged grandmother with the truly dysfunctional family who at least should have SOME feelings, for crying out loud.<br/><br/>That's where the role of Tony Blair comes in to help decode the queen's. Sheen is extremely goofy as Blair at the beginning of the film, truly laughable. I perceived the movie as a comedy while sitting at a movie theater in Puerto Rico with no Spanish subtitles, and due to the subject matter people around me didn't know whether to laugh or not. I laughed and laughed hard, to the puzzled looks of everyone around me (including my wife), because the humor (particularly the exchanges between the queen and Blair) is truly clever. Helen McCrorie as Cherie Blair goes for the gut, and to me, hers and James Cromwell as the Duke of Edinburgh (as excellent as Mirren's!) are the best portrayals of the film. Sheen eventually becomes his role at the end, but the progression is slow at times; I strongly doubt that the real Blair was as a passive player of the events just before Diana's death as the movie portrays him. I see a Tony Blair that is more manufactured public servant than leader of his government.<br/><br/>Sylvia Sims looks too young for her part as the Queen Mum, and is her role is more comic relief than opinionated royal elder; it suits the comic intentions of the movie well, although I have no idea on just how comic the producers and director intended this movie to be. Alex Jennings nailed the Prince of Wales' voice, but he doesn't look the part (he actually looks a lot like George W. Bush in this one!), and his role wasn't as well written. He did an excellent job with the convoluted idea of the prince that was developed for the role. I suspect that the prince in real life felt a lot of second-hand guilt for his ex-wife's death, which isn't as convincing when portrayed by Jennings. I suspect that the royal princes probably played a role in their mother's events, which wasn't even a bleep on the screen on this movie. Finally, the movie was very favorable to both Blair and the queen at the end, but probably understates Blair's contribution to keep things in perspective at the house of Windsor. It is not a very flattering portrayal of the queen of England, but it is probably as real as it gets."
"Red-125","9","0","1","11 February 2007"," Helen Mirren IS Queen Elizabeth!
","The Queen (2006) directed by Stephen Frears, demonstrates the great talent of Helen Mirren, who portrays Queen Elizabeth II. The film is a fictionalized account of the royal reaction to the death of Princess Diana. Mirren is astoundingly good in this role. As I watched the movie, I had to keep reminding myself that it was not, in fact, Queen Elizabeth II I was watching on the screen.<br/><br/>It's obviously impossible for any of us to know what was going on in the minds of the royal family right after Princess Diana died. This film puts forward the plausible explanation that Queen Elizabeth was just following proper and correct protocol as she understood it. Certainly, the Queen emerges as a sympathetic character--someone bound by tradition to do things (and not do things) in a way that might seem unnatural to the rest of us.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren carries this film. Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, James Cromwell as Prince Philip, Alex Jennings as Prince Charles, and Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother never convince us that they are anything other than actors portraying the royal family in a movie. They don't get inside their characters the way the Helen Mirren gets inside her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II. <br/><br/>Tony Blair's character never convinces. In particular, the opening scene--in which he meets the queen in his new role as prime minister--is awkwardly written and badly acted. It stretches belief to suggest that someone clever enough to become the prime minister of England would be so naive about the the proper protocol expected at this important and symbolic occasion. <br/><br/>Despite these weaknesses, I enjoyed the movie and would certainly recommend it to others. Helen Mirren unquestionably deserves an Oscar for her work in this film."

","The death of Diana was handled with impeccable taste; very moving but not intrusive. My only criticism was the choice of Alex Jennings as Prince Charles. He didn't look or sound like Charles and I found him to be completely distracting. On the other hand, the use of archival footage to represent Diana's life was brilliant; no actress has yet been able to capture her charisma and beauty.<br/><br/>James Cromwell's Prince Philip was cold and very unsympathetic - much like the prince himself. Diana's sons are rarely shown in the movie, which I find very respectful toward their grief. All in all, a superb effort."

Again, I'll want to see the film again and again just to lay eyes on all that lush furniture, gilded wallpaper, stone castles and burly Scottish highlands.<br/><br/>James Cromwell makes a wonderful Prince Philip; he's tall, handsome and regal, and yet can be small, mean and rigid; Sylvia Syms is a terrific queen mother. She's a plump English crumpet hiding poisoned currants. Michael Sheen does a very fun imitation of Tony Blair as a sort of bright-eyed chipmunk on speed working to damp down his own hyper energy and charm as he navigates his course past one of the most imposing human landmarks of the twentieth century. <br/><br/>The script is to die for. I -- literally -- laughed AND cried, often at the same time. There are so many funny and heart wrenching lines I thought of ""All About Eve,"" another really, really rich script.<br/><br/>In spite of the world history depicted, and the larger-than-life characters, this is an intimate movie; the moments I'll remember are small ones, for example, when Queen Elizabeth gets out of a jeep and Prince Charles is left alone to drive home. It's an achingly poignant moment in a glittering, just about perfect film."

Thanks to the skillful writing of Peter Morgan and the flawless sets. Even I, who had only a passing interest in the affairs of the British Royal Family was thoroughly fascinated. Ms. Mirren has done an exemplary job in elevating the persona of Elizabeth II in the last half hour of this film, accurately showing the deep dilemma that she faced during this crisis. The British monarchy is not only the last functioning one but has always been the most civilized of all those that came out of Europe in the last few centuries.

","""The Queen"" provides us with a fascinating glimpse into the heart of a royal - or, in the case of Queen Elizabeth II, quite possibly the void where that heart ought to be.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the weeks following the death of the beloved Princess Diana on August 30, 1997 (Diana had just recently gotten divorced from Prince Charles, so technically, she was no longer a part of the royal family). It was during this period of intense national mourning that the Queen demonstrated that she had a tin ear when it came to gauging the mood and feelings of her subjects. For many days, as the grieving multitudes gathered outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, weeping uncontrollably and laying down a veritable sea of flowers in the Princess' memory, the Royals remained holed up on a country estate, voluntary captives to ""protocol,"" making not so much as a single public statement acknowledging Diana's death or providing any words of solace to a hurting nation.<br/><br/>The coldness of the reaction prompted many in England to seriously consider abolishing the monarchy altogether, once and for all consigning it to the ash heap of history as a quaint relic of a bygone era, an anachronistic institution that had long since outlived its usefulness. Yet, the film is much more sympathetic in its treatment of the monarch than that barebones synopsis would suggest, for more than anything else, it sees the queen less as a heartless monster than as an old-fashioned woman ill-equipped to deal with a modern world where baring one's soul in public has become the unquestioned norm and even a dignified solemn funeral is turned into a celebrity-laden, made-for-TV spectacle. She seems genuinely baffled and stunned by the unprecedented outpouring of grief over Diana's death, partly because of the queen's own animosity towards the woman whom she felt demeaned the court by many of her actions, and partly because the queen herself hails from a time when one did one's grieving in private, and when the sole role of a leader in a time of national crisis was to project an image of ""stiff-upper-lipped"" stoicism and strength for her people.<br/><br/>It would have been easy for writer Peter Morgan and director Stephen Frears to have concentrated exclusively on the queen's aloofness and coldness, to have turned her into a caricature of the snooty, self-absorbed, ""let them eat cake"" aristocrat. Instead, the filmmakers insist on seeing her as a fully rounded human being, strong willed and unemotional, yet capable of being wounded by the disapproval of her subjects and of extending a hand of compassion to others in her own uniquely subtle way.<br/><br/>Small wonder that Helen Mirren has been showered with every conceivable acting honor for her incomparable portrayal of this complex woman. Mirren has been handed the challenge of illuminating a character who is, by her very nature, unimpassioned and undemonstrative. As such, the actress has had to rely almost exclusively on the subtlest of expressions and gestures to convey the brittleness, stoicism and genuine royal dignity of a woman who literally grew up in the role of one of the world's longest-serving monarchs (she notes early on in the film that the first person to serve as her Prime Minister was a certain someone named Winston Churchill). Yet, Mirren's ability to also show us the queen's compassionate and vulnerable side is what brings the character to life and engages our interest.<br/><br/>Mirren is matched by the brilliant Michael Sheen, whose performance as the newly elected Tony Blair is every bit as mesmerizing as hers. Blair comes off so favorably in this film that one is tempted to suspect some sort of collusion on the part of the scriptwriter and the Prime Minister himself. As envisioned by Morgan, Blair is the perfect foil for the queen, a ""modern"" man who is able to ever-so-gently prod her highness into saving her royal butt by doing the right thing politically. For Blair is, if nothing else, a clear-eyed pragmatist who, when all around him are calling for imperial heads to roll, shrewdly knows that a palace coup would not be in the best interests of England at this time.<br/><br/>There are fine performances too by James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mum, Alex Jennings as a very milquetoasty Prince Charles, and Helen McCrory as Blair's straightforward, no-nonsense wife who can't understand how her Labor Party husband could be so willing to help the queen extricate herself from the rather sticky wicket she's gotten herself into. The film supplies a generous helping of actual newsreel footage from the time to effectively flesh out the context of the drama.<br/><br/>Almost in spite of itself, the film winds up moving us, even though, in terms of style, ""The Queen"" is every bit as dry, brittle - some might even say ""stuffy"" - as the woman who is its subject. Which is precisely why - for all us Anglophiles out here in particular - it makes for such a jolly good show at the cinema."

","A well acted , well scripted gem. Mirren as her maj. and Sheen as PM Blair are both excellent. The contrast between the young Tony Blair and the staid monarch and how their relationship develops over the Diana crisis is interesting. While the film in no way is flattering to the royal family - by humanizing the lady, Mirren makes her a complex figure, we feel for her bewilderment and hurt as she totally misjudges the mood of the country in the week following Di's death. The mutual respect that Tony Blair and the Queen seem to develop over the crisis is also one of the pleasures of the film. Despite their very different world views one gets the feeling at the end of the film they have a regard of sorts for each other.<br/><br/>Its all speculation of course, we will never know exactly what transpired between these figures in those August days, but its all been gloriously imagined in this film. I found it a great reflection on the loneliness of high office and the fickleness of power. The film reminded me how impressive Tony Blair was in that amazing week. It made it kind of sad comparing this with his impending exit from politics, and the high levels of cynicism regarding his political legacy.

Presumably Helen was somewhat padded to give the overall 'well-covered' shape of her Majesty - but some of her clothes seemed ill-fitting (the Queen's never are, are they?) and Helen's thick legs (real or padded?) look nothing like the relatively slim pins of Elizabeth.

"superduperspit","8","0","1","29 December 2006"," A wonderful and surprisingly entertaining Queen, with a knockout performance by Mirren!
","The Queen, starring Helen Mirren, takes us deep into the monarchy and British government in the week Princess Diana died. Queen Elizabeth II and her family never had a solid relationship with Diana, and after they neglect to pay tribute to her grave or raise a flag at half mast in her honor, it the country almost turns on the monarchy completely. The film plays the inner conversations and workings of that week, recreating the constitutional world and all its sometimes players, as they try to deal with the fateful tragedy.<br/><br/>Much like 2004's Ray, or 2005's Capote, a lot of the attention of the film has been thanks to its lead performance, rather than the film itself. Helen Mirren has led one of the most dominating campaigns in Oscar history, winning every single critics award she could possibly win in this lead-up month of December, even going as far as winning at an African-American award ceremony, where normally only African-Americans are eligible. But, with all the hype, Mirren's praise and eventual Oscar is deserved. She is brilliant in the role, taking it past pure mimicry, with an unbelievably layered performance, showing all sides of Elizabeth seemingly easy. Part of the beauty of her work is that she needs no big scenes, no breakdowns, no showy moments, she plays the performance low-key and subtle, it is in the expressions on her face as she reacts to what people are saying, the way her mouth and face moves throughout the film, that make it brilliant.<br/><br/>Not to be outdone, the screenplay in The Queen absolutely shines. When dealing with a subject like inner monarchy and governmental politics in Britain, where the film mainly consists of people talking to each other, under normal circumstances there would be an opportunity for the film to bore, especially when dealing with someone like myself who knows nothing of the subject. But the screenplay is so sharp and upbeat, the film does the impossible of actually being very very entertaining throughout, to the point where its 1 hour 39 minutes fly by.<br/><br/>The film isn't necessarily heavy on plot and story complications, rather it is an in-depth look at what happened behind the scenes in that devastating week, re-creating the conversations of how to deal with it. While all the monarchy and government are regal, the film manages to paint them as people, whether it be something like Blair's off-shoot comments to his wife after first meeting Elizabeth, or the Queen driving a car into a river, where in one of the film's better scenes, she sees a large and beautiful stag, a symbolism for life and the beauty of it.<br/><br/>The direction, set design, use of real life footage, and ensemble acting besides Mirren, which would include charismatic Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, and other actors playing the parts of Prince Charles, Prince Philip, and Queen Elizabeth I, are all very solid. The Queen is a very well made film, and following in the footsteps of Ray and Capote, I consider it a strong enough film away from the main performance, to stand on it's own as an Oscar contender and worthy achievement to the most quality films of the year. While in the future it will not be remembered as much as something like The Departed from this year, The Queen stands as a worthwhile drama and tribute to Queen Elizabeth II and her toughness and persistence during the mother country's devastating week.<br/><br/>Review by Julien R., written for film site www.boxofficefanatic.com"

The story of this portrait goes back to 1997 the day Princess Diana left this world. Week after her death I had a dream talking to Princess Diana, sitting somewhere on the bench. I remember the question I asked her was who was behind the separation between her and Prince Charles, and why there were so many negative reaction towards this whole ordeal. The reply I got from Princess Diana was if I would have chance to visit England, I should visit town Stafford-upon-Avon where I might find the answers to my questions. But the only thing I was able to get from her was that The Queen was much involved in her relationship with Charles that pushed the whole marriage to destruction. That day I woke not knowing what that dream meant to me. The only thing I knew that the town she mentioned in my dream was the place of birth of famous writer William Shakespeare. That day I was walking by and I saw the portrait of Princess Diana in some small store which I bought.

","This enjoyable film is a fictional account of the relationship between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the royal family after the death of Princess Diana. It's August 1997, Diana is killed in a car crash in Paris. Diana was disliked by the family and is to be deprived of an elaborate state funeral. The family seem like a bunch of petty, out-of-touch nutters surrounded by obsequious flunkies. A hysterical press argues that the House of Windsor is cold and uncaring. They want a proper send-off for the beloved Diana. As the week progresses the public mood becomes increasingly angry. The Downing Street spin machine is activated and equilibrium is restored. The Queen realizes her position as sovereign is dependent on retaining public approval. Thanks to Blair's pressure Diana gets a public funeral and the Queen goes on television, makes an apology and all is forgiven.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the first meeting between the Queen (Helen Mirren) and Blair (Michael Sheen) after he becomes Prime Minister in May 1997. Blair goes down on one knee and asks her permission to become prime minister. The film depicts Buckingham Palace as operating in a parallel universe with elaborate and meaningless rituals which seem to serve no purpose other than to intimidate outsiders.<br/><br/>Tony Blair is in the early days of his administration and he can do no wrong. He is achieving the highest approval ratings of any prime minister and knows how to manipulate the public mood. Blair comes out of this film well. He seems genuine, honest and down-to-earth and to have real affection for the monarchy. The real Blair is an enigma and a creature of Shakespearean complexity. Unfortunately movies, unlike books and plays, have not developed a language to portray a character like Blair. Michael Portillo recently used Chaucer's phrase, the smiler with the knife under the cloak to describe him. The Blair of this movie is a guy you can trust. <br/><br/>The Queen believes she is appointed by God and is known to have cried in public only for the decommissioning of the royal yacht Britannia. Mirren is terrific, she makes the Queen seem good-natured and sympathetic. By the end, you end up liking and respecting the woman. She may be deluded but she seems like a nice person. <br/><br/>The writer obviously doesn't like the secondary characters. Cherie and Blair's press secretary (Alaistair Campbell) seem poisonous. Both want to get rid of the royals. The Duke of Edinburgh (James Cromwell) comes across as loudmouthed dim-wit forever giving bad advice. Charles seems creepy and weak. <br/><br/>The Queen is one of the best films of 2006, but I have doubts about is accuracy."
"arcbonita","Null","0","1","16 December 2006"," Good for anti-Blairists...just where is Robert Fisk?
","Here are a few nice pieces of symbolism that seem so far to have escaped public scrutiny. When the news of Diana's death is breaking, Prince Philip tells those watching about a huge stag that has wandered 'round for hunting. All are tuned to the telly at the time watching Bill Clinton on the news, someone who brought Hollywood to politics, or, rather, who ensured that Hollywood and politics in the modern age became forever ensconced. When the Queen comes into her own after being, in the movie, bullied by Blair, a stag is killed in a hunt. Is that a metaphor? You don't have to have been schooled in Eisenstein's Potemkin et al. to see and to hear that one loud and clear. Could it be the film maker's way of saying a big ""we don't thank you kindly"" now that the word is out that the CIA under Clinton bugged Diana the night of her death? Another good joke at Hollywood for you is this. There is a shot of real footage of Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Elton John and some non sequitorious others at the funeral. They are paid no heed. And well they should not be. Blair, in the end, looks like the idiot that Robert Fisk and others have made him out to be. He is absolutely Lord Blair. The one and the same Lord Blair that Prince Charles has tried to make sure doesn't hurt forever the history of the United Kingdom."

","I lived through 1997 with only moderate interest in Diana; I first visited England as a student in 1954, when the inauguration of Queen Elizabeth II was still fresh in memory. This film effectively raises the death of Princess Diana to great human drama with excellent treatment of family dynamics, politics, and the unfolding of a huge social-historical event. Family, politics, celebrity, the creation and function of myth are all here. Helen Mirren's excellent portrayal is matched by that of Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Credit is due to writer Peter Morgan for getting it all together without burdening the memory or the credulity of the audience."

","This is a movie to be savoured completely! Coming home afterward, it seemed too horrible to turn on the television and spoil the lingering effects of Helen Mirren's astounding performance. She has probably done in any chance of becoming Dame Helen Mirren but she so perfectly delivers one line in answer to Michael Sheen's Tony Blair line, ""I hope you didn't feel managed in any way"" that an Oscar is assured. Michael Sheen also delivers a multi-layered and engaging portrait of Tony Blair, helped immeasurably by the striking resemblance he bears to Blair. The mixture of real TV footage from the week surrounding Princess Diana's death with the enactment was brilliant. I felt that the portraits were sympathetic to the subjects."
"jaredmobarak","8","0","1","28 November 2006"," Will someone please save these people from themselves¬ÖThe Queen
","I generally don't find many biopics to be great cinema. Most times you get a bloated story spanning what feels like millennia with only a charismatic mimic to guide your way. Thankfully every once in a while you'll get a biopic with a real story, an arc that has substance and meaning no matter who was involved. One of these films was last year's Capote, a brilliant cast of actors and an enthralling story of murder, compassion, and misguided affection. Much in this style comes Stephen Frears' The Queen. With but a short week of time to tell, screenwriter Peter Morgan is able to show us a slice of life in the government of England and how they react to heavy turmoil. With the death of Princess Diana, we are shown how a country mourns its loss and how they force their monarch to change the values of a nation.<br/><br/>What is truly fact or fiction, I really don't know. If I am to hold what occurs in this film as truth, which I will for the sake of reviewing said film, it is heartbreaking to watch Queen Elizabeth II fall out of favor with her constituents for only doing what she was meant to do. England is not a democracy; its royalty live by a code of conduct and lead their people with unflinching devotion to their prosperity. When these people decide to worship the memory of a woman who left the family, threw back at them what was given to her, and instead used her celebrity to make a name for herself, they expect all to feel their grief. The Queen feels devastation in what happened to the mother of her grandchildren, and being that she no longer was a member of the royal family, allowed the departed's kin to set the rules. Diana's family wanted a private burial away from the media scruntity that all but murdered her. The Queen does everything she can to keep the wishes of those intimately involved in tact. Unfortunately the people have spoken and all must do their beckoning. It's as if England had become a democracy overnight, telling their elected official what she should be doing, canonizing the deceased while stringing up their leader. In order to save face, Elizabeth must bend to the people and give them what it is they want against all she has ever been taught. She must become a puppet for these men and women who have lost their dignity and instead turned to idol worship and celebrity stardom. The media made Diana who she was, killed her, and then nearly brought down the country as a result. Elizabeth didn't even bow down to a majority rule; no the democracy that formed around her was only at 25% for the dissolving of the monarchy. Credit Tony Blair for seeing the trouble happening and realizing his duty to the crown to try and get the Queen to acquiesce to the people's demands, no matter how unnecessary that action should have been.<br/><br/>Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen are astonishing in their roles as Queen and Tony Blair respectively. They encompass their characters fully and show the inner struggle they each must deal with in order to come out of the media frenzy alive. While the Queen knows her place and did what she felt was called upon in her position, Blair knew the changing times and through utter respect for his Queen, while his coworkers wanted it out of contempt, tried his best to find a middle ground. The two great moments in this film come when Mirren first begins to crack emotionally and when Blair finally shows his respect for what his leader is doing. The reaction upon being asked to help the people grieve by Mirren is brilliant. Her finally saying that see has a grieving family to take care of first and foremost showed her motherly instincts and the fact that Diana was a person and not a figure or photo in a magazine worshipped by the masses. As for Sheen's shining moment, when his people begin berating the Queen for giving a speech to the people but not believing a word she is saying of it, he finally snaps and says that is why she is so great a leader. She was willing to go against herself in order to save the crippling effect her supposed mistakes had on the nation. Being able to put her job aside for a moment, a job she was raised to believe was given to her by God, showed real courage and strength. To express that humility must have taken a lot out of her, but she made the sacrifice.<br/><br/>It is a real difficulty to side with the people of Britain when, during the many cut scenes of real footage, we see thousands of camera flashes amongst those crying. Yes people felt sad about the death, but unfortunately many people were just there for the spectacle, for bragging rights of saying they were there. How could they have the gaul to make The Queen put the flag standard at half mast above the palace when it wouldn't happen even if she herself died. I credit Frears for making both the Queen and Blair at opposition yet at each other's side. There is great impartiality shown here and those who view it can take what they will. To me it opened my eyes to the fact that the people of Britain made the monarchy change what it stood for because of a woman who was not a member of it. Unfortunately humanity has come to the point where a celebrity means more than those that are in power to lead and protect us. I'm sure just allowing me the opportunity to make a judgment on the proceedings, to see all sides of the incident, is all the filmmakers could have wished for. I applaud their success."
"BumpyRide","8","0","1","27 November 2006"," The Royals
","This is a rather sad movie. There really seem to be no winners here. The depiction of Queen Elisabeth, which to me seemed to be a balanced, accurate portrayal of her, comes across as being a rather lonely woman. Helen Mirren doesn't chew the scenery here, and the majority of the actors turn in fine performances, but it does come down to Mirrin herself. At times, she truly does look like the Queen but it's her talent that makes us believe we are indeed seeing into the Queen's world, and that world is very sad. With all the riches, it seems her personal life is very barren and cold. Her dysfunctional family offer no assistance to her except perhaps, ""Mummy."" The stag scene was very symbolic to her. It represented her, a lone survivor caught in a world of change and danger. And like the stag, at that time, people wanted her head on a platter. Tradition must be upheld but at what cost? ""The Queen"" might be a figurehead but it turns out that she is a woman, capable of making mistakes in judgment."

","There haven't been many good movies this year that are actually... serious. I know that serious movies are a big bore to sit through when it is mostly dialouge, but this one tops them and really makes you want to see it.<br/><br/>""The Queen"" is about Tony Blair (Sheen) and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren) during the week of the the tragic death of Princess Diana. Most of this movie is set in the royal family's summer residence in Scotland. The acting of both Sheen and Mirren was the best that I have ever seen. Both of them portrayed the Prime Minister and Queen Elizabeth II so greatly, surely the best acting that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>As I said before, this movie is set in a one week time frame during Princess Diana's death in Paris. ""The Queen"" starts out in the time when Tony Blair is becoming Prime Minister. There are some very funny moments when he is getting used to being around Queen Elizabeth II for the first time that make you laugh. Sadly, this movie isn't all laughter, it is quite serious, except for the fact that there is enough comedy to keep you happy. Next, it shows some clips of Princess Diana's car chase (taken for the movie) and tells some information about her.<br/><br/>At the time she died, the entire Royal Family is awake and deeply disturbed by this piece of news, yet none of them are mournful. ""The Queen"" really does show how the Queen and Tony Blair, also for that matter, the world, would cope with this. This really is the best acting that I have ever seen. The movie never really slows down, but in some parts it is a bit puzzling. To be quite honest, this has been the best movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>By The Way -- If you want to take children to this movie, I would think it's fine. It is rated PG-13 for ""brief strong language"" but even during those two moments, you can't really hear what they are saying. I don't think many children would find this movie interesting though, it's really more of a historic film."

","This film effectively describes some aspects of the history of the British royal family in the narrow period between the accession of Tony Blair as prime minister and the funeral of Princess Diana. Queen Elizabeth II, evidently, considers her subjects in a personal and familial manner. As any mature woman, she is offended by harsh criticism but undergoes a transformation as she reacts to the upstart Blair's attentions toward her, in response to the huge outpouring of raw emotion after the death of Princess Diana.<br/><br/>So, Elizabeth II combines the best features of an ideal modern-day monarch: proper devotion to the traditions and prerogatives of her position, a motherly devotion to her subjects, and a willingness to bend in a dignified manner as she encounters spirited opposition from those she loves and admires. It is a balancing act on a tight-wire that Elizabeth II manages to pull off with the grace that is expected and required, for the sake of her grandchildren and her nation.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the film is full of superb cinematography and charming glimpses at her family's interest in Scotland, hunting, pet dogs, palaces, relations with her mother and husband and son and grandsons, four-wheel automobile driving, and gorgeous gardens. This leads to empathy for what can be described as a basically happy, if grief-stricken, family faced with the death of a loved family member.<br/><br/>Elizabeth II shows her inner strength by upholding the best traditions of her serene and royal family with charm and grace. In the end, the deep layer of affection among her subjects is strengthened yet again by her majesty, as a result of Diana's tragic death."

","In the end, Stephen Frears' ""The Queen"" shows how the traditionalism of the British monarchy comes head to head with the modernization of PM Tony Blair.<br/><br/>Opening the film is the election of Labour Party Prime Minister candidate Tony Blair, three months before the devastating events of August 31, 1997. In his first meeting with HRH Queen Elizabeth II (aka The Queen) after his election, in which, according to tradition, he must acquire the permission of the monarch to be the Prime Minister, The Queen, played by Helen Mirren (""Gosford Park"") is presented to the audience as being a stoic, unemotional woman. It isn't as though Mirren's presenting HRH as wooden, but as a solemn monarch, unhappy with the election and not wanting to show it, but for Blair to know it. PM Blair (Michael Sheen) is seen as an excited for his victory, This is only our first encounter of many more to follow between The Queen and Blair, but certainly a glimpse at what appears to be the repeating battle of traditionalism (here, acquiring the monarch's permission) v. modernization (not seen in this scene, but to appear later on).<br/><br/>After this preceding, almost prophetic, meeting begins the week after Diana, Princess of Wales, is killed in a Paris car crash, the period of time the which the film covers. Prince Phillip (James Cromwell, ""Babe,"" ""RKO 281""), shocked and appalled by the immense outpouring of grief for Diana by people who never even met her, decides to take his grandsons, Diana's sons, stagging at their Scottish estate to keep them away from the press. The Queen, in a criticized decision, decides to come along afterward. Here The Queen decides that the death of Diana is a private manner, not to be discussed publicly, and does not make a statement. Here traditionalism comes into play. Blair, upset with The Queen's decision not to release a statement, comes out with one himself.<br/><br/>In a scene in which The Queen fords a river with a jeep and it breaks down, she finally allows her built up emotions regarding Diana to come out. She just cries. Sitting on a rock in the middle of the river, she just bawls. In an almost metaphorical moment, she sees a stag on the river bank, hears a gun shot and tries to shoo it away. After she looks for where the shot came from, she looks at where the stag was, but it's gone all of the sudden.<br/><br/>As Blair, angry with The Queen for not showing any emotion, comforting a grieving nation, or even putting the Buckingham Palace flag at half staff urges her to do four things, in order to repair the damage she has caused the monarchy: 1. Make a speech, via live television, to the people of England; 2. Pay her respects to Diana's coffin directly, 3. Look at the tokens of grief outside the gates of her Scottish estate; and 4. Lower the flag at Buckingham Palace at half staff. The last demand of Blair to The Queen is a direct take on the traditionalism of the monarchy. The flag is only to be used to signal The Queen's presence, not for anything else, not even to show the mourning for the death of a monarch.<br/><br/>Up until this point, The Queen's, and Price Phillip's, main reason for not making a statement was to look after their grandchildren. Prince Charles, portrayed as a weak, emotional, and non-affirmative man, is too distracted with the preparations for his deceased ex-wife. The Queen relents to all of Blair's instructions. She sucks up her pride and make a speech to the entire world live, even though planned for just England.<br/><br/>This film ends with a discussion between The Queen and Blair and her unspoken gratitude of what he made her do.<br/><br/>""The Queen"" is one of the best films I have seen this year. I would give the Oscar for Best Actress to Helen Mirren for her outstanding, reserved performance of HRH. James Cromwell, also a standout, deserves a Oscar for his role as Prince Phillip. Also, a screenplay nomination would be in order, but not for a win as well as Direction for Stephen Frears, cinematography for the panning shots of the Scottish countryside, editing for the flawless incorporation of archive footage, and for Best Picture."
"anhedonia","9","0","1","21 November 2006"," Why Helen Mirren is one of the greats
","From the opening scene of Queen Elizabeth sitting down for a portrait to the final moments of ""The Queen,"" Helen Mirren completely holds Stephen Frears' film together.<br/><br/>If Mirren is not nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award - in my judgement, she also should win it - the Academy will seriously have to reconsider whether the Oscars honor the year's best.<br/><br/>Making a film about the Royals in the days after Diana's tragic death in 1997 might seem like an odd choice. But Frears and screenwriter Peter Morgan - who incidentally teamed up three years ago for ""The Deal,"" which featured Michael Sheen as Tony Blair - have turned what could very easily have been a trashy tabloid story into a compelling, moving and utterly enthralling political drama.<br/><br/>Yes, we know Frears and Morgan are merely supposing what happened behind close doors at Balmoral. But their imagination seems to have concocted an awfully good tale of intrigue and political maneuvering, while raising interesting questions about the British Monarchy and whether such a traditional institution can exist in a society that changes almost daily.<br/><br/>This is a story of Blair vs. ERII. The question is not whether Diana's death should have created the worldwide outpouring of grief that it did or why, but what the British government and QEII were going to do about it. Whether the grief was warranted or not, it happened. It is understandable that the House of Windsor didn't quite understand why it was happening or how to react. After all, they were more familiar with the British stiff upper lip response, which is what they expected.<br/><br/>The conflict between Blair and Elizabeth makes for exciting viewing. Morgan's script is smart, literate and works in small scenes. His characters are all incredibly well developed. He creates intrigue by carefully calculating the give-and-take between the palace and Downing Street. At times, ""The Queen"" works as an effective political thriller, something I was not expecting and extremely and pleasantly surprised to see.<br/><br/>Frears directs the film expertly. He never over-directs any scene, allowing his film to work in small moments rather than grandiose scenes. He never opts to turn his film into a maudlin and trite story - which could very easily have happened - and many a filmmaker could learn from Fears' use of music. He never lets the score overpower a scene - something American filmmakers should learn how to do - and those moments are more poignant and trenchant because he lets his actors and the situation dictate the emotion.<br/><br/>But the film belongs to Mirren. Frankly, I can't ever recall seeing Mirren give a bad performance. She's been in some films that haven't exactly been brilliant, but Mirren's always shone.<br/><br/>She so completely gets into Elizabeth's persona and - thanks to some terrific make-up, too - there were times I forgot I was watching an actress play Elizabeth. Mirren's performance isn't only regal and elegant, never once betraying her character's stoic or sturdy center, but it also is beautifully understated. She conveys more in just a suggested look on her face than many actresses can with hundreds of lines.<br/><br/>Whether ""The Queen"" defends the monarchy or repudiates it is up to you. But the film is not really interested in that issue. It attempts to provide a fictionalized glimpse into a guarded institution at a time when the British people seemed desperately in need of a leader to guide them."

","Hellen Miren rightly received high honors from the audience when this film showed in Europe. Honors are due all around for the acting, filming and the writing, particularly. However, what makes this film so powerful is its verisimilitude and the subject--no pun intended--of the drama: Queen Elizabeth II herself.<br/><br/>I saw this movie twice and noted particularly the audiences' reactions. The first audience got off to a tittering start at the first, when after the credits, the Queen, sitting for her portrait in Garter regalia, turns from three quarter view to look into the lens directly. A dumb move by the director, guaranteed to raise a laugh. The second audience didn't laugh at this, or at the rest of the film, either; perhaps they too were seeing it for a second time.<br/><br/>The persona of the Queen is consistent, and that is the power. Even when unaware of the death-of-Elvis hysteria mounting in London she comes across as dutiful and dignified. When, ultimately, she bends to the vox populi, it is obvious that she doesn't understand the frenzy, but is doing what she believes is required of her. It is this dignity and duty that affect one, and strongly, for it is in such contrast to the behavior of everyone else (including her heir). What we see is Authority as we want it to be over-run by the dirty world of reality."

","This was nearly as much a film about Princess Di as it was about Queen Elizabeth. The film takes place largely over the ten days following Diana's death when England mourned publicly and the Queen hid away at the Royal retreat at Balmoreal. I'm not sure the value of this sort of film. It's great that the Queen is a real person and all but did we think she wasn't? As an exploration of changing English values, stiff upper lip gives way to public wailing, I think the jury may still be out on that. Maybe it's about the power of television to equalize. Di beats Liz like she stole something sort of thing? No, that can't be. Maybe it's just what it appears to be, a study of The Queen. As such it certainly succeeds. We can't help but like the poor dear when she breaks her aging Land Rover, expertly diagnoses the problem, calls for help, sobs silently over her travails, admires and saves a beautiful deer from certain death. In one three minute scene we see her competence, humanity, vulnerability and love of nature. It's all done perfectly by the sure handed Stephen Frears and could, as a short film, accomplished the same objective. But then we would have missed the footage of Diana and, sap that I am, I was as moved by that as I was Mirren's powerful and understated performance."

Helen Mirren's performance is excellent but doesn't get to humanize her majesty though; ""The Queen"" gives both moments of humor and dramatic situations and would define it an intelligent docudrama, since it manages to turn a slice of history into agreeable entertainment, without ever being too sentimental or didactic. The circumstances told in this movie are obviously tragic and Frears has given us a glimpse of the backstage, showing the audience the terrible way the royal family handled the tragedy.

","As a Scot living in SF for years, I'm detached from the Windsor - Spencer divide. I went only as a Mirren fan. And was enthralled. Mirren is the queen I first saw in 1953 and seen age. The clothes, the hair, the walk and what the stills can't show, the voice. I passed Balmoral last summer and imagined what I knew well, what a joy it must be for the queen to be able to walk for miles beyond reach of press-parasites. and the combination of every character in the movie being real and the script being fiction but fiction of the highest order makes this a special movie. the queen's personal private secretary was wonderful as the constant bearer of unwelcome news. my one criticism is the script's failure to show how much Di failed to play by the royal rules and how much she flouted those rules in awesomely vulgar ways. Dodi, really? where were her Spencer instincts when that nouveau came along? showing Di's public faults would have made the queen's response to Di's death much more human. a superior script, awesome acting by all. what will Mirren wear to the Oscars!!"

I heard a lot of comments, which I certainly agreed with, about how realistic this portrayal was. Also commanding, but a work over done was the character of Phillip. The Queen Mother was portrayed as an old foolish women, which is hardly what she was in reality.<br/><br/>Along with the striking sets and locations, which led to the feeling of regal and splendor, this movie is great overall. Great job, looking forward to acquiring the DVD!!! God Save the Queen, Queen of Canada!"

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and applauded the depiction of a leader who truly leads, in the sense of listening to others but in the end making up her own mind. It appeared to be a realistic depiction of a leader whose heart is in the right place--particularly in light of her ""training""--but also one who is able to listen to the people and flex when she is certain of what her role should be vis a vis them. Cudos to Stephen Frears for not portraying her as a stereotypical woman.<br/><br/>My question is related to the degree to which the movie was based on fact. How many of the key interactions were made up versus being factual? For instance, were the lines of Tony Blair's wife and Prince Philip's totally made up or at least based on reliable information about their viewpoints?"

","Mark my words, this movie will result in an(other) Oscar nomination for Helen Mirren. Very well acted. You know that when you forget who the actor is and believe you are really watching the Queen of England. I felt like a voyeur peeking through a camera lens looking behind the scenes at a period in the Queen's life that must have been truly hard - the sadness and beauty left in the wake of Princess Diana's short life. Extremely moving and sure to choke you up and even bring a few tears. Her husband, Prince Phillip, doesn't fair very well nor does Tony Blair's second-in-command. The one thing I noticed most about the actors surrounding The Queen, and this includes the Queen Mum and Prince Charles, they may not have been look-a-likes but they certainly captured their mannerisms, especially the guy who plays Tony Blair. There's one sad moment in the Queen's life involving a beautiful (deer) stag just before she is to go before the cameras and address the world over Diana's death. Very well played.<br/><br/>Best movie I've seen this year and I've seen everything worth while to see, thus far."

","This is a sensational film that deserves every accolade it has received. For the first few minutes of the film I was aware that Helen Mirren was playing a part but for the remainder I thought I was privy to the Queen of England and her personal thoughts. The goal of all acting is to make one forget they are watching a performance. Helen Mirren gives a wonderful performance that is the cornerstone of a wonderful film, at once showing the Queen as musty and magnificent. This is a film that everyone in Britain can embrace. You see all sides of the fallout following the car accident death of Princess Diana in Paris and you feel empathy for all those sides. For an American, I perhaps finally had an inkling as to what the monarchy means to Britain -- a cornerstone of their democracy, a keeper of tradition and their national integrity, immune to the random opinion and yet sensitive to its people. This is a film that lays out the monarchy to criticism and admiration at the same time -- quite a feat. Cheers for Helen Mirren and director Stephen Frears -- for me this is the film of 2006!"
"moutonbear25","9","0","2","21 October 2006"," All Hail THE QUEEN
","In August of 1997, Diana, the former Princess of Wales, was killed in a car accident. An international sense of grief overtook the modern world. She was charitable, a humanitarian, and a beautiful one at that. She was adored by millions for being flawed, for never rising above the level of the people or appearing entitled. She was modern royalty, a royalty that connected with the masses instead of one that looked down at its people from a pedestal. And while the families of the world grieved the loss of an icon with an outpouring of emotion, one family chose to keep the loss to themselves, a private family matter. That family was the Royal Family. Director Stephen Frears (MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS) bravely crosses the gates of Buckingham Palace to show the millions who watched from outside what might have been going on inside during the week following Diana's death in this intimate and delicate portrayal of THE QUEEN. <br/><br/>Frears shows both respect and restraint in his telling of this tale. No one character, including Diana, is over glorified, making all points of view and perspectives relevant and reasonable. For all his nobility, Frears' directorial efforts are surpassed by a sensitive and balanced script by writer Peter Morgan (and by the delightfully enigmatic performance by Helen Mirren as The Queen, but more on that later). Morgan's script came together from a collection of interviews and discreet contacts. The remaining details were filled in by his imagination. The result draws many lines, leaving opposing forces on each side of the gate. Two months prior to Diana's death, Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) was elected to office with a landslide win. He represented the modern man and the people hoped his youth would bring England a desperate revolution. England though, will always be caught between the old and the new as long as the Monarchy exists. The Monarchy by nature cannot be modern. It is steeped in tradition, some that even the family laugh at. But though they may laugh at them, they are always upheld. What the Queen does not see coming is that her allegiance to tradition has brought her and her family so far removed from her people that they no longer understand them. As the Royal Family continued to say nothing regarding Diana's death, the public pointed their anger for their loss directly at them, insinuating that they had no compassion, no hearts. But as much as the Queen did not consider their feelings, the people did not consider hers. Different people grieve in different fashions and Morgan's script shows the Queen's decision to not speak publicly about Diana's death not as a cold decision, but one that placed her family first, especially her grandsons. The very public death was also a very private matter. The closed gate between both parties never allowed either to fully comprehend the other.<br/><br/>By now you have heard how good Mirren is as The Queen. Trust me, you will continue to hear this until the moment she walks up to the stage to accept her Oscar (or at the very least, a BAFTA). Mirren's humane performance is often hilarious and always insightful. In one moment, she is sarcastically dismissing the newly elected Blair; in another she is lost but determined to understand, her eyes fixed on a television interview of Diana talking about the way the Royal Family treated her. From her side of the gate, she has given her entire life to her people; they will always love her for it and respect her decisions. Mirren's eyes are always searching for understanding, while maintaining her dignity and exhibiting restraint. At first it seems she is searching to understand why the reaction to Diana's death is so massive. To her, Diana had always been trouble and had brought so much shame upon her family. As her search continues though, she is striving to make sense of the disdain and contempt she feels growing in her people. It is not that she is no longer connected to them; it is just that she doesn't see where they are coming from anymore. How could she? She knows a very different side of Diana's story than they do. In one very simple yet overwhelming scene, The Queen gets her four-wheel drive vehicle stuck in a stream. She is alone, surrounded by nature and waiting for someone to come pick her up. In that moment, she is overtaken. She says nothing but her mind's thoughts echo the daunting position she is in. The mother of her grandsons is dead; her people have turned on her; she is the bloody Queen of England and she is stuck in a stream! It is all too much and she bursts into tears. She is only human after all.<br/><br/>I must admit, I did not get swept up in the worldwide grief over Diana's death. Of course, I saw the enormous size of it but I was just not taken in by it. Even with my detached position, it is impossible to avoid being taken in to it when watching THE QUEEN. It is also not possible to support but one side thanks to Frears and Morgan. Being placed on both sides only allows for the possibility of tapping in to both expressions of grief. The grief is only heightened by the inability for both sides to empathize with the other. There is no way to know for certain how the Royal Family actually grieved the death of Diana but when THE QUEEN impartially opens the gates that have since been closed, one might hope this telling is close to the truth, if only because this possible truth will certainly heal."
"general-melchett","9","0","2","20 October 2006"," A great British film - The Queen is one of the best films this year.
","The Queen is a highly original film - very few people have ever made a film about what happens behind the gates of Buckingham, and none have made one on such a controversial subject. This film is great in just about every aspect - the acting is absolutely top-hole and deserves Oscar/BAFTA nominations, the script is absolutely brilliant and captures the feel of life inside the more important places of Britain. The humour is sharp - though it won't be understood by all, and the settings are absolutely grand - Stephen Frears and co. must have been given permission to film inside residences of Her Majesty. As a Brit myself, I feel it is very good how The Queen has managed to speak out the truth about what happened in late 1997, rather than being afraid to tell the truth and ending up as a pile of patriotic, uplifting trash like most films do these days. This is without a doubt the best Brit flick of the year - it beats Stormbreaker hands down, and I hope it wins some awards - it is a breath of fresh air in modern cinema. The actors actually do look like the people they play - which is another positive thing about The Queen. So, why did I give it 9 out of 10? The problem was - there were just no emotionally striking bits in the film - some bits seemed a bit sentimental for the sake of it. But hey - with a film on such a tough subject matter as this - there have to be sentimental bits. And when they are completely washed away by a film as great as this, you sometimes forget they are there. This is great British film-making at its best - see it if you can. 9/10"

"grandenchilada","9","0","1","16 October 2006"," Her Majesty, Helen Mirren
","Oscar pool tip: It's Helen Mirren, all the way. I'll be surprised (and will rise up in arms) if she doesn't get it. Every acting prize this year, in fact, belongs to her miraculous performance as Elizabeth II. The Queen, directed by Stephen Frears, and expertly written by Peter Morgan, is a delightfully elegant satire, a surprisingly complex film. I was expecting a fun, broad skewering of the royals; and it is certainly fun, but it isn't broad. I did not expect such grace and humanity from a satire, and such intelligent restraint. The movie is as much about the crisis of the British monarchy because of their tone deaf handling of the death of Diana, as it is about the disappointment of Blair's promise, the increasing irrelevance of the monarchy, the nature of duty and power, protocol and politics, and about the transformation of this world into a vulgar media spectacle. It is a highly satisfying movie with many levels to parse. And if you just want to have a good time peering into the private lives of the royals, you can too. The Queen is less about what happened ten years ago, than about the state of England now. And as such, it strikes a somewhat elegiac, bitter tone for what should have been. It shows a bright, eager and naturally attuned Tony Blair (fabulously portrayed by Michael Sheen), who started out his mandate by doing a most extraordinary bit of public relations. Basically, because of his intuitive, compassionate handling of the death of that insufferable pest, he had all of England eating from his hand. One cannot help but sigh as you see him handle this crisis so well, (which today seems utterly banal, as crises go), being so attuned to the mood of his people, almost singlehandedly saving the monarchy from imploding, and then realize that he wasted all the good faith of his country through a misguided, hubristic allegiance to George Bush. He seems to be as tone deaf to the will of his people about the war in Iraq, as the Queen was about the death of Diana. Except that the war in Iraq is a far more serious matter. The parallel is brilliant and it stings. There is a wonderful scene where he defends the Queen from the scathing sarcasm of his colleagues. Evidently, as the man in charge he identifies with the woman in charge. He is mesmerized by the allure of the monarchy, the mystique of such ritualistic, almost God-given power. Such is the seductive nature of power, which must be why some of those who are in power are also in bed with others in power they shouldn't be touching with a ten foot pole. In the end, the movie is not that kind to him. Just to look at him then and to see him now is rather sad. About Diana, I think the film gets it quite right. If anybody was a selfmade creature born of the constant necessity of media attention, it was her. I never swallowed her beatific little act. I don't begrudge her her many acts of charity, but it always seemed to me they were narcissistic, selfserving. In the film they show that famous interview where she bats her eyelashes innocently and claims she wants to be the queen of the hearts of the people, or some such patently manipulative rubbish like that. Today the footage looks like a performance, calculated and maudlin. It's hard to believe people fell for it. Fittingly, of all the historical people in her saga, she is the only one in the movie who appears as herself always through the eye of a camera. She is only real when scrutinized by the media. Obviously, what made her death so fascinating was that her end was so apt to her story. She lived by the cameras and she died by them. The film posits the idea that Diana actually usurped the role of the Queen. While the Queen was mired in dusty protocol, and chose to live her very public life in as much privacy as possible, with a just disdain for the media circus that her daughter in law craved, Diana basically took it upon herself to act like a fairy tale princess for this age, with spectacular results. She stole the love of the Queen's subjects. The disenchantment and disappointment in the Queen's face when she registers this fact not only moved me deeply, but it is one of the many beautiful moments of Helen Mirren's incredibly human, funny, precise performance."

I feel that it was there business to morn in private, and Mirren's show of emotions and lack there of are outstanding.

","I've seen a lot of movies regarding British Royalty and this has been by far the greatest ever made. The first moments of the movie introduce you to HM the Queen with only a few sentences and that regal look. From that point forward you are hooked on this woman even to the point where you become angry at all those who attack her. Helen Mirren portrays HM the Queen with grace and poise, truly showing the desire of the woman inside to reach out to her family, but sacrificing her emotions in service of her people and tradition.

"alanpuzey","8","0","1","9 October 2006"," A great slice of history
","In a way I don't want to critique 'The Queen' so much as as what is going on on our wonderful IMDb website. 'The Queen' is much in the news at the moment and so when I searched for it under that name, I expected it to be the main contender, but hundreds of other films came up with 'queen' in their title and (although I could not be bothered to scan the whole list) I could not see the current movie starring Helen Mirran. This film was top of the list when I searched for 'Helen Mirran'. Some mistake here, I think! Once in the the correct pages I found many (expected) excellent reviews of this movie and I would just go along with most of these. Helen Mirran is utterly superb and I can only imagine that she will NOT win the Oscar for best actress because so many people are now saying she will. Such is life - but she gets my vote.<br/><br/>Her performance alone would not make this the great movie it is. ALL the characters - particularly Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Tony Blair are brilliantly portrayed and the use of newsreel footage used to advantage.<br/><br/>It's a few years since Frears has made such a tremendous movie - and I feel that in many countries of the world he would probably have been executed for making such. However, in the end, it is the viewer that makes up their own mind as to whether England's queen is hero or villain; Frears and Mirran together do such an excellent job in leaving the final interpretation up to you."

","From the first frame of the film as Helen Mirren sits for a portrait, her QUEEN ELIZABETH is firmly established as a character of great intelligence and force to be reckoned with and admired. Ms. Mirren from that point on brings to the screen in THE QUEEN a time period that all over the world we remembered with tears and trepidation at the death of Princess Diana. What Ms. Mirren gives us now in THE QUEEN is a brilliant peak into the mind of a Monarch who had to make some very difficult and important decisions to begin the healing process of the British people over the untimely death of ""The People's Princess"".<br/><br/>THE QUEEN moves along at a solid pace,as the sets, costumes and the cast are simply tremendous. Director Stephen Frears has delivered in THE QUEEN a film that is not only a way back into history, but he gives us an actor of such great talent as Helen Mirren to deliver a performance that is so powerful and complete. Moreover, as we look at what has transpired for Tony Blair today, and then look at his stance in THE QUEEN, it is such a shame that such a brilliant British political star as Prime Minister has gone all for naught.<br/><br/>The writing by Peter Morgan is crisp, brilliant and captures the minds and thoughts of Brish Royalty to a ""T"". And the final scene in the film with Elizabeth and Blair is one that will stay with me and captures that moment in time that has now past. With THE QUEEN we are assured that Helen Mirren will be holding a golden statuette in the future."
