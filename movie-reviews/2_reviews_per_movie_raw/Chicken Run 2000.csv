","Hailing from the animation house that brought us such jems as Morph, the Wallace and Gromit series and Rex the Runt, Chicken Run is the first ever feature length claymation ever attempted.<br/><br/>Set on a chicken farm in Yorkshire some time in the middle of the century, our plucky (sorry) heroines face a lifetime of hard labor laying for the farmers, and if their performance is not up to par they quite literally face the chop.  Ginger, making her way to the top of the pecking order (sorry again) attempts jailbreak after farcical jailbreak, but success is less than forthcoming.<br/><br/>Enter Rocky The Rhode Island Red, (Rocky Rhodes for short, and you can't blame me for that one, the writers came up with it) apparently able to fly, the chickens look to him to help them bust this chicken coup, but Rocky is not what he may appear to be.<br/><br/>That's the plot in a nut (egg?) shell, and as you can imagine the subject matter made for perfect ""salutes"" to the classic world war 2 escape movies, references to which abound throughout.  From Ginger tossing a baseball (actually a sprout) in the ""cooler"" (coal bunker), to Fowler's incessant ramblings about his old RAF days.<br/><br/>The lead characters are deep and endearing enough for you to care about what happens to them, if a little stereotypical at times.  The interaction between them is fluid and believable, all the more amazing considering that Mel Gibson never even set foot in the same recording studio as the other actors, reading his lines in a studio in America instead.  The supporting cast provide plenty of humour and Mrs. Tweedy substitutes quite nicely for the Nazi camp commandant.<br/><br/>The animation is lively and colourful the characters wonderfully expressive in that unmistakable style developed in the Wallace and Gromit shorts, and thanks to the fact the sets are real models there is plenty of scope for dramatic lighting effects.<br/><br/>The only real fault I could find in the film was that it just seemed a little too... American at times.  Hollywood's involvement showed through the English setting to some degree, especially as you get to the movie's climax which seems to go a bit overboard, especially compared to the utterly hysterical ending to The Wrong Trousers.  But all in all I have to say I really enjoyed this movie.  Now all we need is a Wallace and Gromit movie."

","After watching ""Chicken Run,"" you will become a believer of many things.<br/><br/>You will believe that a bunch of talking hens wearing beads and bandanas can speak with British and Scottish accents, practice martial arts, escape from inside a pie machine and secretly plot their getaway from an egg farm in 1955 England. You will believe that chickens can knit, dance, wear glasses and play the harmonica.  You will believe that rats can wear bad suits and have an obsession for eggs. You will believe that roosters can fly airplanes, ride a tricycle and sing  ""The Wanderer.""<br/><br/>Most importantly, you will believe that the otherwise Disney-choked world of animated films has life again, and that a tiny British studio can top the big boys from Japan and the U.S. and turn out the smartest, possibly best work of this genre ever.  The one point of light in an otherwise lousy summer movie season, ""Chicken Run"" is something you'll want to watch over and over again. You could sit through it 31 times (like yours truly) and it never gets boring. The audienced applauded at the end during my first 13 viewings.<br/><br/>Aardman Studios has concocted a recipe consisting of a wonderful (albeit portly and feathered) cast, a funny, intelligent script, a gripping score, excellent cinematography and production design, plus great voice work, all mixed with years of labor and love, and the result is what is easily the best film of 2000. When was the last time you saw a movie with a cast  nearly all-female, no less  so determined and believable in their mission for freedom, and whom you cared so strongly about that you were actually cheering for them to be successful?<br/><br/>""Chicken Run"" may be the first animated film that is an absolute joy for both children and adults. Children will be tickled by the jocularity of these hens, while adults will find pleasure in discovering homages to classic prison films  ""The Great Escape,"" ""Stalag 17"" and even ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" among others.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick has come up with a sharp script, which has all but become a lost art in the movie world these days.  The dialogue is loaded with puns that work so well.  The British slang is a delight, and makes the chickens' personalities more endearing and  dare I say it  human.<br/><br/>One of the best lines comes from Mrs. Tweedy talking lovingly about her soon-to-be chicken pie enterprise. When Mr. Tweedy asks why she only will be included in the brand name, her reply is: ""Woman's touch. Makes the public feel more comfortable.""  The other is Fowler's immortal ""Pushy Americans, always showing up late for every war."" That's simply brilliant writing.<br/><br/>The flawless (yes, flawless) voice cast is the heart of this movie. This is one of those rare films in which both the heroes and the villains are fun to watch. You'll find yourself thinking during the end credits, ""I liked this character the bestno, wait a minute, I think I like this one moreno, no, I like that one.""<br/><br/>Leading the way is Julia Sawalha, playing another character with a spicy name (from ""AbFab's"" Saffy to CR's Ginger), and providing the ideal heroine we moviegoers have yearned for so long. She's so convincing in this role; you're deeply immensed in Ginger's quest for free range living that you forget she's a Plasticine chicken.<br/><br/>It's safe to say that 2000 has been the summer of one Melvin Gibson. He doesn't disappoint with ""The Patriot"" or with his role as Rocky, the vagabond flying rooster (listen to his hysterical rendition of Dion's ""The Wanderer""), who easily bested his squirrel namesake at the box office. The film pokes fun at him in a good-natured way, from his opening ""Braveheart"" gag to his nationality.<br/><br/>Rounding out the supporting cast is Lynn Ferguson as the genius Mac, she of the wild hen's comb and odd spectacles.  Jane Horrocks is a show-stopper as the innocent yetwell, bubbleheaded, knitter Babs.  She doesn't have much dialogue, but definitely does the most with the least as she delivers the funniest lines in the movie with aplomb.  Perhaps the film's most famous line is when she bawls ""I don't want to be a pie!"" Why? ""I don't like gravy.""<br/><br/>Ben Whitrow's Fowler, the old military rooster, had me in stitches with his constant rambling about his glory days in the Royal Air Force.  Seriously, wouldn't we all want to be awakened by a rooster who hollers, ""Cock-a-doodle-doo, what what""?<br/><br/>Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels are a hoot as Nick and Fetcher, the Laurel & Hardy-style farm rats. Tony Haygarth and Miranda Richardson (not straying very far from her ""evil wife"" role in ""Sleepy Hollow"") are perfect as Willard and Melisha Tweedy, the cruel owners of the prison camper, egg farm. The loving couple is an evil version of American Gothic rendered in clay. Mrs. Tweedy is the best animated villain since Maleficent from ""Sleeping Beauty.""<br/><br/>But my favorite (and this was a tough choice) was Imelda Staunton as the brusque, oversized and argumentative, yet lovable, Bunty. She was the character I related to most because my personality is sometimes like hersI think I may have finally found my role model! My favorite part in the film was watching Bunty getting down to ""Flip Flop and Fly.""<br/><br/>The ending contains the most thrilling action sequence I've seen all year. I won't dare describe it herego and experience the magic for yourself.  What I will say is that I haven't had this much side-splitting fun with an ending since ""Mrs. Doubtfire.""<br/><br/>I haven't enjoyed a film like this since ""Sleepy Hollow"" was released 7 months earlierneedless to say, this has been a period of movie ecstasy that is as rare as hens' teeth, so to speak.  I'm sure nobody will care, but what I found interesting about ""Chicken Run"" was that it bore a striking resemblance to SH in terms of the plot: a small citizenry, kept prisoner by a villain who has a fetish for decapitation, pins their hopes of freedom on an outsider who is brash and sure of himself on the outside, yet soft and bewildered on the inside.  Both movies are in my personal top 10 of all time.<br/><br/>After watching this, I dare anyone to find another movie that is as heartwarming, witty, suspenseful and funny as ""Chicken Run."" To those who feel the need to criticize this film for any reasonI deeply sympathize with your lack of soul. 10/10"
"AdRager","10","56","64","20 June 2000"," Something for everyone
","Chicken Run is a wonderfully entertaining movie for EVERYONE!  Kids will love the eye-candy of chickens doing absurd things and tossing off silly one-liners.  Adults will enjoy the brilliantly funny dialogue and the sweet, engaging story.  Parents will enjoy taking their kids to a movie that does not have the Disneyesque product tie-ins and must-buy soundtrack.   Movie buffs can try to count the references to The Great Escape, Stalg 17, Star Trek and Braveheart and may be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the camera work.<br/><br/>Nick Park, Peter Lord & Co. succeeded (where so many other have failed recently) in making an animated movie whose story, plot and dialogue are equal to the brilliant animation.  In the wordless opening minutes we are engaged and in invited to care about these silly chickens.  By the time the snappy dialogue gets rolling we've already identified with the chickens' plight.  It may be a bit slow through the middle for the younger moviegoers. But the sound of laughter, cheers and applause from the whole audience as the chickens make their final bid for freedom is well worth the wait.  The only sad part is we may have to wait another five years for another Aardman Animations to produce another picture of the quality."

","'Chicken Run' is a delighted little film about...well, chickens. I've always loved the claymation of Aardman. 'Creature Comforts' and 'Wallace and Gromit' are among many of my favorites. Aardman Studios have come up with a brilliant cast, a funny and smart script, fine cinematography and production design. The inspiration of films like 'The Great Escape' shows. The female characters are so strong and yet they have their own sense of humour and Brit-wit. Aardman's claymation is splendid. The large eyes, body size and shape and movements create this a unique class of comedy. The writing is very sharp and crisp but I disliked the obvious symbolism (of British and America joining hands to save the world and fight evil) which looked a little forced. I don't see the need to make the Rocky character an American rooster (as if it's an ingredient to have an American on board). Yet, that does not take away the sheer pleasure and entertainment one derives from the film. The voice cast is suitably chosen. Gibson plays the typical hero with charisma but it's the Brit cast, which includes names like Imelda Staunton, Lynn Ferguson, Jane Horrocks and Julia Sawalha that did it for me. Their sharp witty humour and strong will just put them on a league of their own. 'Chicken Run' is a cute, heartwarming, uplifting and hilarious little film. To quote another user, it is eggcellent!"

","This movie is all you could hope for in summer film fare.  It had action, suspense, romance and a large helping of comedy.  I was predisposed to love the movie, being a great fan of Wallace and Gromit, and the movie lived up to those other award-winning works.  The movie works on every level, and was fun for all ages viewing it.  Even my husband, who disdains children's movies, was truly enjoying himself.  Needless to say, the children loved it, despite one rather gruesome off-screen moment, but that seemed not to matter too much.  All in all, I can't recommend this movie too highly, it was incredibly entertaining and well-done."

","As an older gentleman with a rather refined taste in flim viewing, I was surprised by how absorbed I got in this elaborate cartoon-like feature. It's no mean trick to create rubber characters that you can really care about.  My favorites were Mr & Mrs Tweedy -- especially the latter.  Mrs Tweedy was the personification of evil (within the confines of a cartoon of course) and just a thoroughly interesting character.  The sets were well done, especially the Stalag 17 camp image (notice the 17 on the meeting hut).   Lots of British stereotype stuff which worked pretty well and kept my attention.  Fast paced without becoming just another Roger Rabbit.<br/><br/>Recommended!"
"Movie-12","8","23","29","3 August 2000"," Animation at its best, with outstanding characters and a clever story. ***1/2 (out of four)
","CHICKEN RUN / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>	""Chicken Run,"" DreamWorks Picture's newest animation festival, is an old-fashioned fairy tale with more heart and truth than most movies can even imagine about containing. The film's animated style contains state-of-the-art clay-animation techniques, which make it worth the trip to the multiplex just for feasting your eyes on such brilliant special effects. Directors Peter Lord and Nick Park, with co-writer Karey Kirkpatrick, give the characters depth, reason, and dimension-even if the main star is a feathered farm animal that converges with his companions about political matters. <br/><br/>	""Chicken Run"" details the miserable lives of a clan of chickens being withheld within a sinister dairy farm in 1950's England. Ginger (voiced by Miranda Richardson) is the central character, who, along with her acquaintances, deeply lust for the sweet smell of freedom that lies beyond the constricting boundaries of their pens. The unhappy farm owners, the smart and devious Mrs. Tweedy and the dumb and precarious Mr. Tweedy, brutally dispose of chickens who fail to produce the amount of eggs they require.  <br/><br/>	When a overzealous circus Rooster named Rocky (voiced by Mel Gibson) stumbles onto the farm one evening, the other chickens blackmail him into teaching them how to escape. This is also when the Tweetys lurch up a devilish new plan to strike it rich by purchasing a machine that will turn innocent chickens into merchandising pot pies. <br/><br/>	The film's plot is steady, solid, and knowing; it portrays a series of events that gradually build tension eventually inducing an exciting climax that is both conclusive and satisfying. ""Chicken Run"" is a precise piece of filmmaking, an inoffensive family adventure that will entertain audiences of all ages. <br/><br/>Regardless of how well crafted it is or how artful the material, the movie is about chickens escaping out of their pen in order to find genuine independence. No, the stakes are not nearly high enough, and with a plot like this, it is only natural for some audiences to expect a shallow, cheap cartoon publicity stunt. However, the filmmakers make this movie feel original, fresh, suspenseful, and involving, regardless if the main characters are chickens with patriotic instincts."

","I wasn't very excited about watching ''Chicken Run'' in the beginning. A friend of mine, Aluísio, told me the story was good and worthwhile, so, since I have the movie in my house I decided to watch it to see if it was really nice.It is not my favorite animation, but the movie is quite good actually!Until I saw the credits running, I would never say that Mel Gibson was Rocky's voice. And I found the characters very, very expressive,specially in their facial expressions.<br/><br/>It was funny to see a reference to Braveheart in this movie, since I watched Mel Gibson's performance as William Wallace yesterday. (When Rocky says he's from ""The land of the free, the home of the brave"", Mac immediately says, ""Scotland!"" This is a reference to the Mel Gibson-directed film Braveheart)<br/><br/>The plot of the story is simple: The chicken from Tweedy's farm are horrified with the idea of becoming the next meal of the day. Ginger, the leader of all chickens,with the help of Mac, is always trying to scape from the farm with her ideas and plans. One day, she met Rocky, a rooster that apparently can fly and is escaping from his circus ' owner. They make a deal and she agrees to hide him if he helps all of the chickens to escape. Their relationship starts to progress, but the art of flying doesn't. And Mrs Twwedy starts to have more and more strange ideas of what to do with the chickens and make her profits higher...<br/><br/>aka ""A Fuga das Galinhas"" - Brazil"
"RobT-2","7","20","28","10 July 2000"," One radical cartoon
","The great animation director Chuck Jones has often stated that his cartoons ""weren't made for children.  Neither were they made for adults.  They were made for me.""  Jones's seven-minute shorts were made on a far lower budget than the animated features of today.  With features, much more money is at stake, as well as the livelihoods of more people.  Because of the pressure to make back the investment, animated features can give an impression of being created by committee, as though tailored to fit some committee's idea of a prefabricated audience segment.  It's remarkable, then, that Aardman Animation's ""Chicken Run"" shows off so much personality, the mark of a film made not for an imagined mass audience, but because it satisfied some need for the filmmakers-besides the need to put food on the table, that is.<br/><br/>The story revolves around an English egg farm designed a lot like a WWII-era prison camp, with overtones of the Nazi concentration camps as well, in that chickens that don't produce end up as dinner.  While most of the chickens are resigned to their fate, one plucky hen named Ginger keeps leading escape attempts and keeps getting locked in ""solitary"" for her pains.  Her task takes on new urgency when the Tweedys (the couple who run the farm) prepare to convert their operation into a chicken-pie factory.  Hope arrives in the form of an American known (amusingly, in view of the recent ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" film) as ""Rocky the Flying Rooster"", whom Ginger thinks can teach the chickens how to fly.  Naturally, Rocky isn't really what he seems to be, and the revelation of his secret threatens to dash all hope of escape, because everyone knows chickens can't fly-or can they?<br/><br/>Unlike most cartoon films, ""Chicken Run"" is animated using clay figures in stop-motion.  While this process involves much more labor than drawn animation, it also makes easier the use of many of the tools of live-action filmmaking, such as dramatic lighting and moving camera work.  Directors Peter Lord and Nick Park both have considerable experience in this field, Park with ""Creature Comforts"" and the ""Wallace & Gromit"" series (perhaps the most popular animated shorts of the 1990's) and Lord as a co-founder (with David Sproxton) of Aardman and director of such shorts as ""Adam"", ""Wat's Pig"", and ""Early Bird"".<br/><br/>The look of ""Chicken Run"" displays a harmonious blending of Park's and Lord's strengths; the character designs have the cartoony look of Park's work, while the more realistic settings and backdrops (which appear subject to grime and weathering) are typical of those in Lord's films.  All the major characters are distinctive and believable on their own terms; even the numerous chickens have their own distinct looks and voices.  The only times the illusion of believability fails are when a clay chicken collides with a metal fence; I half expect to see the clay figure sliced up on the way through.  (This may be a personal reaction, conditioned by years of exposure to ""Tom & Jerry"" and ""Roadrunner/Coyote"" cartoons.)  The story moves efficiently and contains much humor and detail that reward close attention, as well as bravura set-pieces such as Rocky and Ginger's dramatic encounter with the Tweedys' pie machine.<br/><br/>While it has justifiably been compared with military prison-camp escape movies such as ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"", as well as with the revisionist farm-animal melodrama ""Babe"", the movie ""Chicken Run"" resembles most is Pixar's computer-animated ""A Bug's Life"".  The resemblence lies partly in certain details of plot (such as the hero[es] who isn't/aren't what he/they seem to be) but mostly in the nature of the story itself. While human prisoners have a life before prison upon which to look back upon, the chickens in this movie have never known such freedom.  Thus, when Ginger talks of escape, she not only urges them to change their location but their entire way of thinking.  In chicken terms, this is a radical message, the same one put forth by all the great human radical organizers: that those who are exploited have a right to expect a better life.  Though the species and the methods of exploitation are different, ""A Bug's Life"" shares this revolutionary message (with Flik playing the radical visionary part).  Both movies also stress the importance of banding together against oppressors whose power turns out to be more apparent than real.<br/><br/>While one could quibble about such commonalities, I'm impressed that two such films exist at all, that they were funded by major Hollywood studios (Disney for ""A Bug's Life"", Dreamworks for ""Chicken Run""), and that kids love them and parents don't mind watching them more than once.  One wonders if the parents know exactly what it is they're watching, and letting their kids watch.  Then again, maybe they, too, believe they and their children deserve better lives, and enjoy seeing fellow victims of exploitation get such a life in the end."

I've probably seen ""Chicken Run"" at least 30 times since I was little, although there is some animal cruelty involved which is unfortunate for a G rated kids movie, despite that it's a heartwarming experience and I barely spoiled anything by mentioning the cruelty; you literally find out in the first 10 minutes in.

If you've ever watched any World War II POW movies, you'll appreciate all the references here: the POW huts, the British accents, the over-bearing ex-RAF rooster, the solitary confinement, and even the Great Escape references.

"l_rawjalaurence","8","3","3","30 December 2014"," Wonderful Animation Packed with Intertexts
","Watching Peter Lord and Nick Park's glorious animation story of a group of chickens escaping from a repressive farm in 1950s Britain, one comes to understand how the script draws on a whole raft of classic war films of the period, including THE COLDITZ STORY (1955), STALAG 17 (1953), and most obviously THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963).<br/><br/>All of the elements are there, treated with a tongue-in-cheek reverence that makes the film a memorable experience. Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha) is the lead chicken, desperately trying to devise escape plans from the farm policed by Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth) and his shrewish spouse (Miranda Richardson). The need to escape is paramount; all the chickens have to hope for instead is a life dedicated to laying eggs and a violent death by strangulation, as the Tweedies cook yet another tasty Sunday dinner. The only problem is that Ginger's task is hampered by the well-meaning yet rather clueless inmates, led by Babs (Jane Horrocks) and Mac (Lynn Ferguson). The entire group are 'supervised' (?) by the Brigadier Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow), using the kind of Fifties Received Pronunciation accent that immediately recalls the war films of that period.<br/><br/>Enter Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson), a self-assured refugee from the circus, with a cockiness (pun intended) recalling Steve McQueen in THE GREAT ESCAPE. Although eventually helping to create a successful escape, Rocky has to learn how to co-exist with a group of Brits, that requires both races to become more accommodating, and less xenophobic. The script allows for some jokes familiar to viewers acquainted with World War II history (all Americans are ""overpaid, oversexed, and over here.""<br/><br/>Although only just over eighty minutes long, the film is packed with incident as well as some really funny jokes. CHICKEN RUN is a joyous experience, a tribute both to the talents of animators and script-writers alike."
"mercury-26","10","3","3","15 July 2000"," Run (TO the theater)!
","Remember those old Christmas movies that used stop-motion animation, like ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" (you know, the one with Heat Miser and Snow Miser). In a way, that kind of animation was more fun because it has such a personal touch. Each frame requires a human hand to make a change. Digital animators are brilliant, true, but let's face it: isn't digital all about making animation easier? There is a programmer and then a computer that does the actual work. Companies like Pixar and Industrial Light and Magic have made great strides, but a film like ""Chicken Run"" shows you that the Old School still has a few tricks up its sleeve. Just consider that they've made a big, spectacular, blockbuster film--in the year 2000--with Claymation!<br/><br/>This film was made for kids, so they keep the story simple. It opens with the chickens of Mrs. Tweedy's chicken farm trying in vain to escape. At first it looks to be a remake of Wilder's ""Stalag 17,"" only with poultry. With the fence and the rows and rows of shacks, it's really just like a POW camp. After the opening sequence, though, there are many references to other classic films, many of them Speilberg (coincidence?), but the story carves (pun?) out a life of its own. There is an outsider who has a secret, kind of like ""Stalag 17,"" but here it's an American (the film's set in England) rooster named Rocky that crash-lands inside the camp. He's one of only a few men in the camp (it's an egg farm) and becomes an instant celebrity. The organizer of the escape plans, Ginger, suggests he teach them all to fly just as soon as his wounded wing heals. Problem is, Mrs. Tweedy is building a pie-making machine designed to mass-produce chicken pot-pies and time is running out.<br/><br/>The film is genuinely funny. I never had to laugh at anything in it out of courtesy. Not every joke flies, but you will howl more than a few times.<br/><br/>Every once in a while, there needs to be a stop-motion or Claymation feature to remind us that you don't need a computer necessarily to bring the imagination to life. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"" come to mind as other recent examples. Both stop-motion and Claymation have one important characteristic in common: the need to be photographed. In my opinion, there will never be a time when the human eye can truly be fooled by the ultra-real images created by a computer. One method digital animators use to make their characters more real-looking is the use of light and shadow. If you look close enough at, say, the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" (Spielberg again), you know it's not real shadows you're seeing across the back of that T-Rex. Like everything else on its body, a computer paints those shadows. With stop-motion, the animators can really light their images, using the full spectrum of colors, light, and dark that film stock offers, not to mention panning and trucking, split focus images, and other conventional film techniques. It just looks more, well, welcoming.<br/><br/>In closing, before I spoil the fun, be in a hurry to see ""Chicken Run.""<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"TuomoH","8","17","28","29 December 2003"," One of the best animations I've seen
","Chicken Run comes from the creators of Wallace and Gromit, that should say it all already. The animation is set at a chicken farm (yeah, or a ""concentration camp"", I got it). Most of the chickens seem pleased with their lives - although you get your head chopped if you don't give enough eggs - but Ginger is determined to get away. When Rocky, a flying yankie rooster falls from the sky and gets his wing hurt, flight plans seem to get more realistic. In exchange of getting a hideaway from the circus Rocky comes from, he promises to teach the chicken to fly.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is top notch. The fact that you know you're watching a wax animation in the days of CGI graphics makes things more interesting. The characters look familiar from the first moment if you've seen any Wallace and Gromit before (and if you haven't, you should). There are lots of little details everywhere and you can say that lots of hard work was put into this flick. And those little details (like the use of ""human"" objects such as spoons) make you chuckle. There's probably a lot more to see than catches the eye on the first viewing.<br/><br/>I laughed many times during the movie and on overall, the jokes suit the movie. Of course there are some cliched jokes and characters but that can (mostly) be forgiven because these are stupid chickens (or rats) after all! You get to laugh at the expense of yanks and britons alike, since Rocky is a big-mouthed boy from the States and the rooster of the farm is an old British officer. However, at the end you'll see that to accomplish something great you need the help of everyone involved.<br/><br/>The movie connections are probably multiple. I'm just not good at catching these things but that Indiana Jones action scene was hilarious. The humans are not seen much and they just seem a big threat to chickens but their actions don't make enough sense. When you think of the concentration camp theme, the analogy makes their actions more sensible. Or maybe I just shouldn't think of things like this when watching an animation about talking chickens. And, when you try to look at human actions from the view point of an animal, barely anything makes any sense anyway.<br/><br/>Anyway, Chicken Run is an entertaining movie to watch and since it's an animation, you don't have to care about the plot holes or other shortcomings. I gave this one an 8. One of the best animations I've seen. Recommended!"
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","5","17 December 2015"," You'll believe chicken can fly, once you watch Chicken Run! Chicken Run is awesome!
","Being a huge fan of Wallace & Gromit film series & old school WWII Prison films like 1963's ""Great Escape"" & 1953's 'Stalag 17"", I was really looking forward to this movie, when it came out. It had a unique look to it, with its stop motion clay animation style. Directed by Nick Park & Peter Lord, and animated by Aardman Animations as the studio's first feature-length film; Chicken Run tells the story of a band of chickens lead by Ginger (Voiced by Julia Sawalha) trying to escape from certain death, when the owners of their farm, Mr. & Mrs. Tweedy (Voiced by Tony Haygarth & Miranda Richardson) decide to move from selling eggs to selling chicken pot pies. Can the smooth-talking Rhode Island Red named Rocky (Voiced by Mel Gibson) teach them to fly or will they end up, being the main course when Mrs. Tweedy get her hands on them? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie was amazing that it even got finished. After all, Aardman weren't really sure at first, if they could pull off making clay figure of chickens moving in a set, because how awkward, they might had look, but somehow, they were able to make them look enchantingly believable. For a stop-motion animation film, this is some of the best work, I have saw. It was poultry in motion. The exceptional British voice-acting from the cast add to the unique characters in this film. The chickens are highly individual, completely believable, and wildly funny side characters. My favorite character in the film had to be Babs (Voiced by Jane Horrocks). Her posh-like speaking voice, matches so well with her character, very air-headed and spacy, jumping to strange conclusions and not fully grasping what's going on, behavior. Lots of laughs from her. However, there was a little language barrier with some of the Cockney and Scottish accents from other supporting characters like Mac (Voiced by Lynn Ferguson) & Nick (Voiced by Timothy Spall), that made me, scratching my head, due to them, being hard to understand. For the leads, Mel Gibson really stood out as the cocky American playboy here with the tone of his voice. He was really literally a chick magnet, back then. I also like, how his Australian accent wasn't showing at all. He really did sound like, he was from show business with his Hollywood-like attitude. Still, there was one thing that bug me, about his portrayal. I really, didn't like, that he didn't sound like he was from Rhode Island, in which his character is supposedly from. You would think, the movie would hint at that, a little more. Anyways, while the trailers, make it might seem like Mel Gibson is the main hero, it's Julia Sawalia as Ginger, who really stands out in this film. She really sounds like a woman with a plan. You really sense, the urgency within the tone of her voice. The villains were also well-played by Tony Haygarth & Miranda Richardson. They really do stand out, with their over-paranoia and axe-crazy personality. The humor is a mixed bag for me. There were a lot of moments that really did hit my funny bone, mostly in the British style of slapstick humor; yet some of the dry humor needed some more work. Then, there are some U.K pop-culture references that clearly went over my head, like the spoof sequence from 1951's Ace in the Hole or 1971's And Now for Something Completely Different. It didn't make a lick of sense, to us, Americans, but for the most part, I understood, most of the jokes. Some of the jokes could be a little too complex for children, but for the most part, it works within its means. Despite, being stuck in one-location, the movie is full of action and adventure. I love every minute of it, from escaping pie-making machines to the climatic airplane chase. The music score from Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell really add to the epic scope of these scenes. One scene, that really bug me, was any of the scenes with the rats. I really thought, they would had been cut out. The whole scene where they're debating on, what came first, the chicken or the egg was somewhat annoying and drawn out. It was the only problem, within what might seem, like a very well-paced film. Still, the story was mostly 'alright' category for me. Mainly because the story wasn't really anything new and often full of clichés. The whole third act, ""liar revealed"" cliché wasn't really needed with its gloom. Regardless, I'm still glad, that Nick Park and Peter Ford cut some of the darker sequences from the film such as like; Fowler (Voiced by Benjamin Whitrow) being an abusive alcoholic & a chicken eaten by the watchdogs in an escape attempt. That would be way too grim for a children film. Overall: I like this, incredibly creative, highly detailed, animated film. Memorable characters and a cool prison escape plot, made this, a must-watch. So don't be a chicken, go run and see this movie."

","What other movie could I take 10 relatives ranging in age from 10 to 55 in the midst of an extended family gathering weekend?

And he had taken a course in swing music at college so got the satire of ""Jump, Jive and Wail"" too. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson did a surprisingly good voice-over, but the star voice is Julia Sawalha, the daughter ""Saffron"" from ""Ab Fab.""<br/><br/>This is not just for kids only, being hugely satisfying fun.<br/><br/>And stay through the amusing credits (hey, I want to be a puppet wrangler!

","In 1963 the late Steve McQueen starred in the immortal film, The Great Escape."" Anyone who has seen it, will recall with great admiration the steadfast courage it took for the allied prisoners to continue to keep trying to escape, despite so many failed attempts. This movie "" Chicken Run "" is a Comedic reminder that courage is often the basis for other characters to be seen in that heroic light. Mel Gibson is the easily recognized voice behind 'Rocky' the flying rooster who believed he had escaped from the rigors of a performing circus. Unfortunately, his escape brings him to a chicken farm where he discovers Ginger, a egg laying hen who's trying to find freedom for all of her friends. The problem is Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth and Miranda Richardson) are planning to convert their egg farm into a Chicken Pot Pie producing industry. Since they plan on modernizing their place, Ginger demands that Rocky teach the chicken how to fly before the transition. A delightful film for young and old alike.

","As I have a very low opinion of Mel Gibson, it is especially noteworthy that I liked ""Chicken Run"". Made by the same people who make the ""Wallace and Gromit"" cartoons, it portrays a gaggle of hens trying to break out of a British farm - some scenes even spoof ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"" - with the help of American rooster Rocky (Gibson). With the perfect blend of humor and suspense (and in a cartoon no less!), this is one movie that's sure to please everyone. I really liked the constant ""holiday"" comments, and that end sequence was a hoot. Also starring Julia Sawalha, Miranda Richardson, Jane Horrocks, Imelda Staunton, and Timothy Spall."
"vertigo_14","9","2","2","27 January 2005"," Have you ever seen a bad Nick Park movie? I didn't think so.
","'Chicken Run' probably gave Nick Park his long overdue credit as an extremely talented writer and director. And, with its extreme blockbuster success, we Yanks were finally able to find Nick Park's other films, such as the Wallace and Gromit short animated features, in regular release on the store and rental shelves.<br/><br/>This movie puts us right in the middle of a rural English chicken coup where Ginger, the unofficial leader of the hens, has been trying rather unsuccessfully to break she and her fellow chickens out of their prison, always rebuffed by either failed techniques or babbling Mr. Tweedy and his vicious watchdogs. But, fate seems to work in their favor when, at Ginger's near breaking point, Rocky the ""flying"" rooster, a circus fugitive, lands in their chicken coup. In order to avoid his cover being blown (no one here but us chickens!), he convinces the hens that he really is a flying rooster. Of course, his little white lie has serious repercussion as, for their last resort, Ginger wants Rocky to teach the hens to fly, as they would finally be able to escape their incarceration in the coup.<br/><br/>Of course, the hens must come up with a successful plan fast because, meanwhile, evil chicken farmer, Mrs. Tweedy, sick and tired of making minuscule profits, decides to turn her farm into a goldmine. Rather than worrying about egg production, she intends to fatten up her poultry darlings and turn them into chicken pies. Chickens go in, pies come out! I adore this movie most of all for its simplistic, but creative fashion of establishing its setting. The chicken coup is made to seem like a prison with the initial goal for the hens being a successful breakout. The Tweedys act as their wardens. And, as punishment for fugitive escapees--solitary confinement (or, to absent minded hens, ""holiday). Every little detail is worked into the story. Second, like all Nick Park, is the pleasure of a strange, but hilarious assortment of heroes and villains such as bubbly Babs (my favorite), braniac Mac (""I swear she ain't speaking English""), and the old-timer, Fowler. Nick Park has certainly nearly perfected the arrangement of all things to make such perfectly creative, absolutely hilarious feature film and short comedies in ways I have usually seen with Tim Burton's early movies (especially Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas). I have yet to see him make a poor film.<br/><br/>And, after this movie, you may never again want to eat chicken. (Or, at least until you've forgotten about the movie)."
"MovieAddict2016","9","2","2","30 July 2001"," A great movie for all ages
","At first I had thought this would be another disney-like only kids movie. But I was very surprised, it entertained me! The plot is a group of chickens are planning an escape from Tweedy's farm, where it is like a prison for chickens(scenes taken from old movies, like the great escape,etc.)but after many attempts,(all untriumphant) all but one chicken is ready to give up, Ginger. Then one day ""Rocky the flying Chicken"", drops in from the sky, with a broken wing after making a landing on the chickens water barrel. Rocky then agrees he'll teach them to fly if they hide him from the circus(who come looking for him). And they have to get out of there fast, because as they are practicing flying(at many failed attempts), Mrs. Tweedy is making a pie machine, for a bigger profit off the farm. So the chickens have to be out fast, or they're pie! <br/><br/>   I thought this movie was funny because it wasn't all kiddy jokes the whole way through. It's kind of like the Toy Story movies,great for all ages. Don't be turned down by the story, plot, or goofy looking characters, it's great movies like these, that get into my list of great family films, and that's hard to find nowadays. Toy Story did a good job, and Shrek was pretty good(it had a couple things that were adult,esp.-swearing, and the princes ""equipment"" reference(hint hint) without that shrek would of been a perfect FAMILY movie, but it's still great as a regular movie, don't worry i'm not putting it down on being a bad movie..anyway I think if you're looking for a great family night rent out the toy story movies, chicken run, and when it comes out maybe shrek(as a family night) but if you're looking for a non-family night, just a fun night, rent out all of those! 4 out of 5 stars"

For all those who delight in the amazing 24 frames per second, sometimes 10 seconds per day filming (NOT to slight the filmmakers in any way!), I completely forgot about that a minute in to the film. The guy with a flashlight looked a little jerky in the first scene (intentional to remind the viewer?), but after that, Ginger especially showed powerful desperation, triumph, annoyance, anger and wistfulness. She became a real person, far more than this real world and I greatly wish I could join with her soul for a while. She's cute, she's determined, she never gave up even though numerous setbacks forced this team leader to cry, throw a fit at the fence, and hang her head.<br/><br/>She had a dream, imagined something that didn't exist yet, and overcoming impossible odds. Luck helped, and Rocky helped for her to see she and the other chickens could have FUN and we could laugh with them while not losing sight of...the dream. -But she has a good and strong heart, to not turn mean and angry in that place.- Babs survived by not knowing and not realizing, Bunty survived because she was pessimistic and accepting of her life most of the time, Fowler lived on past glories and keeping everyone in line even though no one really accepted him.<br/><br/>""Thank you Fowler.""<br/><br/>Mac..Mac thought his way through. 'Scuse me, her way through. He survived by thinking about everything objectively, as a scientific problem rather than bucking against numerous variables and overbearing tyrants.<br/><br/>But Ginger is the leader, the dreamer. You can see her, rolling her eyes, laying down plans, using her hands a lot..staring death in the face with a indignant ""Oh....great!""...looking adorable when she nods her head...and then shakes it back and forth, smiling slightly.<br/><br/>CR is a lot more for me than just a fun movie, and I didn't prove the point I set out to, that CR's also for kids. The few scoffers I see are convinced it's a Disney sing-along. ""The effects are great, man, but Dinosaur's story sucked, so will Chicken Run."" (I like Dinosaur for what it was, loving more the score and scenery than the dialogue, so you don't have to defend it.)<br/><br/>It seems to me that kids would get it, and all my adult friends save one who hasn't seen it, felt comfortable and awed.<br/><br/>CR is an excellent movie. Even if you hate its guts after seeing it, it's still worth the cinema ticket price and talking with a few friends. Go see it.<br/><br/>The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.

","Chicken Run is a film that has come from Aardman studios, which has made some classic (Oscar winning) shorts, including Wallace and Gromit.  Now, after a 5 year absence, they return with a actual full length feature. What's so amazing:  It's entirely claymation, which means each shot had to take time to move each character and so on. The film itself is great.  The plot tells the story of Tweedy's farm, which holds some very anxious chickens, who want to escape before Tweedy (voiced by Miranda Richardson) makes them all into pies.  But, a lone rooster (voiced by Mel Gibson) comes to they're rescue in a hilarious tale of freedom and chickens.  Great fun, mainly for the kids, but parents will also like the puns that come along.  Amazing animation makes me wonder if their should be a Oscar category for best animated film (and if this is this years prize winner).  A+"
"coffeyaddict","10","8","18","6 January 2004"," Feminists rejoice!
","Chicken Run (2000) is a good film for kids.  A female figure, a hen named Ginger, is the heroine.  She organizes the hens in order to escape their prison.  The two male chickens are fibbers and not as helpful as they at first appear to be.  Ginger, however, manages to encourage them enough to make them useful.  The roosters do their part to help save the day, along with all the hens, but they don't take over the operation.  There are no princesses in this story, no helpless females awaiting a man's rescuing arms.  There is some romance, but it is egalitarian and modern.  No Victorian values here (George Lucas must hate this movie; in his version, the rooster would come in and single-handedly save the day).  This film boasts great stop-motion animation by Wallace and Gromit creator Nick Parks. It is extremely funny and might just teach kids not only compassion for animals, but also that women can save the day.  Loosely based on The Great Escape (1963), this film is not a mish-mash of clichés and poorly written dialogue.  It is clever enough to entertain kids and their parents or babysitters."

","A moment comes and goes too quickly in 'Chicken Run'. A chicken named Ginger has just received a shock and looks directly into the camera in a very tight close-up. There is, in those eyes heartbreak and betrayal. Director Nick Park has figured out what George Lucas and Frank Oz figured out when creating Yoda. It isn't enough to have a character that can move and blink their eyes. It's what is behind them that counts.<br/><br/>This kind of real gesture is on display all through 'Chicken Run' a delightful animated feature debut from the creator of Wallace & Gromit. He has created a film that works on a level that never seems written specifically for six-year-olds. The characters are chickens, yes, but underneath they are as smart as we are.<br/><br/>The story: The chickens of Tweedy's farm are in a desperate state. Their cruel owner demands results and when one chicken doesn't fill her quota of egg production, its the chopping block. To further the example of the dilemma our heroes face, we hear the whack of the ax and later see a plate of chicken bones on the kitchen table.<br/><br/>A hen named Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha of 'Absolutely Fabulous') tries plan after plan to escape. She has tried tunnels, digging and a catapult all to no avail. Every time she gets close, Mr. Tweedy catches her and throws her in the box. If this sounds a bit reminiscent of 'The Great Escape', the movie has more up its sleeve. And yes she does have a moment at which she bounces the ball (or in this case cabbage) off the wall of the box.<br/><br/>Ginger begins to realize that time is of the essence when Mrs. Tweedy turns from egg production to the more profitable business of making chicken pies.<br/><br/>A blessing falls from the sky in the form of Rocky the Flying Chicken (no smiles please). He comes sailing out of the sky bellowing 'FREEDOM!' and if you know Mel Gibson's movies you'll understand that. Rocky has just escaped from the circus and Ginger thinks that he may know how to help fly over the fence.<br/><br/>Nick Park and Peter Lord are professionals at Claymation. Park made Wallace and Gromit and the delightful 'Creature Comforts'. Lord made 'Adam' (you can smile at that one). They have not only managed to create great expressive eyes but give them large expressive mouths with rows of bold white teeth. The clever dialogue by screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick (who wrote ""James and the Giant Peach"") is no shock to anyone familiar with Park's past work. They speak, as people would, not in tired old clichés and catchphrases.<br/><br/>In place of tired catchphrases we get clever homages to 'Braveheart', 'Indiana Jones', 'Sweeny Todd', 'Star Trek', 'Stalag 17' and the aforementioned 'The Great Escape'. The characters in 'Chicken Run' aren't all the same character multiplied. We get: a ruffled old veteran, a dim-bulb constantly knitting, a pair of swindling rats and a Scottish hen. That Scottish hen gets two of the movie's best homages to Star Trek. The first line 'Captain she can't take anymore' we expect. The second we don't expect and I wouldn't dream of spoiling it.<br/><br/>'Chicken Run' reminded me a lot of 'Antz', that great forgotten computer animated feature from two years ago. Both use state of the art animation to tell stories about characters that aren't lead around by their fast food tie-ins. These are films about perseverance and teamwork and contain characters that open their mouths and actually have something worthwhile to say.<br/><br/>NOTE: PLEASE STAY THROUGH THE CLOSING CREDITS!!!"

","Perfect fun story, perfect fun characters and perfect fun jokes. How could someone not love this movie?.<br/><br/>Best way to describe this movie is ""The Great Escape"" with chickens. It sounds silly and of course the movie also is just that. It perfectly and amusingly spoofs classic prison camp movies, most notably of course ""The Great Escape"" and ""Stalag 17"". Yet the movie knows to become more than just a spoof and it creates its own identity, with its own humor and other strong points.<br/><br/>The biggest power of the movie is that is intendedly ridiculously made made, with silly looking characters and lets face it, also a silly story but everything is yet made very seriously. The contrast of that makes this movie work out very amusing, hilarious and also most definitely exciting. The two big action sequences form the highlights of the movie. It are sequences any other normal serious action would be jealous of.<br/><br/>The movie is really great looking. This was the movie that introduced claymation to the main stream audience. Quite amazing once you start thinking about how this movie is made, purely with the use of clay and stop motion effects. This movie definitely raised the bar for future claymation projects. The characters are fun animated and look really over-the-top. The look gives every characters its very own identity and personality.<br/><br/>The characters are all great ones. Especially the villainous and human characters of the movie Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy are great. Mrs. Tweedy is an excellent deliciously over-the-top and stereotypical movie villain, perfectly voiced by Miranda Richardson. Also all of the chickens are highly amusing and originally brought to the screen, with Mel Gibson and Julia Sawalha as the voices of the two main characters.<br/><br/>The humor is fun and understandable for kids but especially great for the adults. It's the subtitle of all of the humor that really makes this movie such an hilarious one. So yes, I can recommend this movie to the kids but I can perhaps even recommend it more to the adults who perhaps even more shall enjoy watching this movie. This movie is irresistible to watch for everyone.<br/><br/>The story is kept simple so it always remain understandable and the movie easy and pleasant to follow. It all is done in a good quick pace with some nimble editing and good camera-work.<br/><br/>The musical score from Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell, who already did some great work together on the other animated movie from DreamWorks ""Antz"", is just brilliant. It's so totally brilliant and action like spectacular and uplifting for the entire movie, that it again is in contrast with the silly aspects of the movie. It in a way makes the musical score also hilarious, just because it's so brilliant.<br/><br/>It all makes the movie simply nothing short of brilliant as well as extremely entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie that made me fall in love with Aardman Animations.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"Stampsfightclub","8","1","1","24 December 2006"," enjoyable chicken film
","*possible spoilers*.<br/><br/>An enjoyable easy to watch film that focuses on a group of chickens who wish to escape the claustrophobic area of their chicken farm to live in the outside world.<br/><br/>Through animation the film conforms to the 'family' easy to watch together film genre and the effects are simply stunning. 4 years in the making Chicken run provides stunning animation through the clay characters and the makers of Wallace and Gromit really worked well over 4 years to complete this likable fun packed comedy.<br/><br/>There are different types of chicken, all destined to be funny which I found they were. The stereotyped organised wanting chicken in Ginger, the noble and show off central character Rocky, the geek stereotype in Mac (Whom I loved!) the dopey fat chicken in Babs and the evil chicken farm owner was also a great villain. Having a variety in characters allows for audience expectations and fulfils them completely to justify a diverse choice of opinion in the chicken actions e.g. how are they going to get over the fence. The film adds excitement and suspense as it engages audiences to expect an enthralling challenge to see how the chickens will overcome the many obstacles they face.<br/><br/>The story is fast moving for an animation to add to the excitement. As the characters all have a goal in mind there is a real drive and determination about this film.<br/><br/>Conventional, predictable and coincidental it maybe the film is targeted towards a more child centred audience and fulfils their expectations completely. Children will love the characters as they act stupidly and look the part to. I loved the humour as well; I believe audiences of all ages can watch this film as it is one of those for enjoyment, one you don't need to get too attached to.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson's character was interesting because he screams freedom during one scene, a line most famous from his role in Braveheart.<br/><br/>I liked this film also because it gives hope and inspiration to the individual, through the use of Ginger mainly who never wants to give up her destiny for a happy life and to be a free chicken.<br/><br/>Watch it ifyou love animated good natured inspirational films"

","If Nick Park knew how to do anything, it was to create a fun family film with funny characters and jokes all around. After all, he is the creator of Wallace and Gromit.<br/><br/>Chicken Run (2004) is Nick Park's latest achievement, and a parody of The Great Escape. It centers on a group of chickens lead by Ginger, who are forced to lay a certain amount of eggs every week, so the farmers may sell them. If they don't fill the quota, they become dinner for the two farmers who own the land and the chickens. When the farmers get a new idea, and decide to speed up business by making chicken pie. Of course, this means that chickens go into the machine, and pies come out. This also means bad news for the chickens. Since Ginger thinks of escaping 24/7, all the other chickens depend on her for a plan. But, since all her plans have failed so far, the chickens are near doomed. Or, it seems that way, until a rooster named Rocky comes ""flying"" into town. Rocky tries to teach the chickens how to fly, and escape from the farm- that is, if he can fly.<br/><br/>The funny characters with a wonderful cast help and the same wonderful stop-motion animation in Wallace and Gromit are the elements that bring Chicken Run to life. They are used to express funny jokes, that won't exactly leave you howling with laughter, but will manage to exert a chuckle. No, it isn't as funny as we'd like it to be, but some jokes don't hurt anybody, do they? Overall, Chicken Run would most likely be described as ""lovable"" and ""delightful"" only because those adjectives are true. What can I say? It's just fun! But, I didn't think it lived up to Nick Park's other creation: Wallace and Gromit.<br/><br/>Good: Fun, lovable, funny, good animation <br/><br/>Bad: I thought it was a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

Has to do with this Chicken Farm in the Countryside of England. These Chickens who have to lay eggs till they're unable to anymore. Once that happens they get killed by the farmers.<br/><br/>They tried all they can to find a way to escape from this horrible place. It's like a prison to them.<br/><br/>When all hope seemed lost this American Rooster just came by who might help them out.<br/><br/>Chicken Run is a great and an instant classic film by Aardman Company and presented by Dreamworks. It's so great you'd want to see it again and again. All you Wallace and Gromit fans will enjoy this one allot.<br/><br/>It's a real treat and it's perfect for the whole family to see."

But after time to think about it, I believe that Chicken Run is a rare film that can be many things to many separate people. For children it is a rousing adventure, for movie buffs it is a witty tribute to dozens of classics, for teens and adults it is an engaging story with shameless puns and innuendo, for lovers of animation it is the best big screen clay animation ever released.

"pizzapooch-2","10","1","1","9 December 2000"," Superb animation classic!
","""Chicken Run"" is one of those films that adults don't want to admit they enjoyed, because it's animated, and is mainly aimed at kids. In the wake of the three ""Wallace & Gromit"" shorts, NIck Park has created a painstaking recreation of life on a farm in 1940's England. Mixing slapstick humour, off-the-cuff ""adult content"", (that 99% of kids won't understand, but will wet the pants of every viewer over 18), and the documentary realism of his earlier work ""Creature Comforts"", this movie is simply stunning! Quirky, sharp, and even poignant, it simply begs to be watched time and time again. Ideal for young and old alike, but with a definite plus factor, for those at the senior end of the age range! Be warned however, that some relatively coarse language has been let through, and may not be entirely appropriate for the younger members of your family! Oh, and keep an eye right through the end credits, or you'll miss a fabulously sly joke! A guaranteed cracker!"
"CharltonBoy","9","1","1","8 December 2000"," Superb entertainment.
","Chicken Run is a brilliant example of figure animation, in fact the best example you will ever see. The makers Peter Lord and Nick Park deserve another oscar( they already have two!)for this because this is just superb. The story revolves around a group of chickens who are trying to escape from a farm lead by a dopy farmer and his overbearing wife. If the Chickens do not produce eggs they are for the chop! Then along comes a circus performing rooster who misleads the chickens into believing that he can fly hence raising their hopes of an escape. This is all set around the theme of the 1960's film ""The Great Escape"".<br/><br/>It is an adventure, a comedy and a love story all in one and the most amazing thing is they are all plasticine figures!! Mel Gibson,Jane Horrocks and Phil Daniels are just some of the stars who provide the voices. 9 out of 10."
"TxMike","Null","1","1","26 November 2000"," A marvelous and entertaining ""clay-mation"" film for young and old alike.
","For the theme of ""Chicken Run"" think ""Nazi prison camp"" and films like ""Great Escape"" and ""Stalag 17."" The chickens are prisoners in the chicken farm, and all but one of them gives no thought to the fact that as soon as a hen quits laying eggs, she will become dinner for the owners.<br/><br/>But ""Ginger"" is different. She sees what is going on, and is constantly trying to devise escape plans. Each time she gets caught, she gets thrown into the coal bin, solitary confinement, then back to the other chickens.<br/><br/>Some mild SPOILERS follow. The film takes a dramatic new direction when a young rooster, voiced by Mel Gibson, ""flies"" into the chicken yard. believing he really can teach all of them how to fly, they all go into a training program. Meanwhile, the owners get tired of their meager profits from eggs, and buy a humongous machine to make ""chicken pies.""<br/><br/>Aside from Mel Gibson, all the voices are by accomplished British actors, and are all just perfect. The British accents, and the fine British humor in the script, make this a totally enjoyable film. The ""chase"" scene inside the pie-making machine, and the high level of action in the ""airplane"" scene are just great.<br/><br/>I have the DVD. Aside from the expected great picture and surround sound, the ""extras"" are quite entertaining. Especially the ""making of"" which shows exactly how the clay-mation is done. Example - during character dialog, a different head is substituted for each successive frame to accomplish the correct mouth shapes. Also, an animator normally turns out 60 frames, or 2 1/2 seconds, of animation daily.<br/><br/>I rate this ""8"" of 10, which is about the highest I give for an animated film which is also how I rate ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Toy Story 2""."

","By now you probably already know the rough synopsis for this movie (""The Great Escape"" with chickens) so I won't dwell upon that aspect of it. What I will say is that it has been a long time since I came out of a movie feeling so joyously happy and utterly satisfied with what I had paid my five bucks for. This movie is everything you could hope for and more: funny, sad, scary, tense, beautiful, fresh and vital. The chickens are all fully-fleshed (feathered?) out characters and so you care deeply for them. The surprise is how powerfully the movie conveys their plight, whilst at the same time perfectly balancing the needs of young and old audiences to be given a constant diet of humor and excitement. There is so much detail in this movie that I think I will need to see it at least a half-dozen more times to take it all in. It will make you feel like the first time you saw ""Toy Story"" or even ""Star Wars"". Pure, undiluted cinematic joy."

","Chicken Run is the best example of what can be done with claymation. (Even better than Wallace and Gromit - amazing since those shorts are brilliant.) The characters faces are so expressive that you quickly forget you're watching clayfigures! The artistry is something to be in awe of.<br/><br/>The storyline is a lot of fun (my ""inner child"" was having a blast), it also expresses a very human desire: to be free. Ginger is a chicken determined to live a life outside of laying eggs on demand in an egg farm. She tries to escape continually, trying to bring the others along with her, but fails as often as she tries. Her determination and persistence are to be admired. She's no dumb cluck.<br/><br/>Into their lives comes Rocky, an American Rhode Island Red who seems to know how to fly. Ginger tries to enlist his help in escaping. He's reluctant, but quite enjoys being surrounded by giggling hens. The escape attempts that ensue are hilarious. And yet, you find yourself wrapped up in their plight as Mrs. Tweedy, the egg farmer's evil wife comes up with an even worse fate for them.<br/><br/>Will they fly the coop? Does Rocky indeed know how to fly? Or will they fall victim to Mrs. Tweedy's latest scheme?<br/><br/>There's a great deal of action, humor, and even endearment throughout this movie. It holds your attention from beginning to end. It's nice to see a movie that really is for everyone.<br/><br/>I hope the Wallace and Gromit movie I've heard whisperings about will come to fruition!"

More than once I found myself awed by the superb technical detail.<br/><br/>At the same time tho, this was another one of the same... a smart chick (Gromit), dozens of dim-witted hens (Wallace), the mostly dark motif of both ""A Close Shave"" and ""The Wrong Trousers"", and the chicken-pie mechanical foe (""knit-o-matic"").<br/><br/>The adversaries were too normal- I'll take a robot-gone-wrong cur or a scheming penguin any day over a money-hungry matriarch and a hen-pecked hubby.<br/><br/>Then there's the minor flaw pointed out elsewhere of how the heroes un-escaped back into the barracks so easily after monkey wrenching the pie-o-matic.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong, this is entertainment every moment and worth every buck.

This movie was probably the best childrens movie we've seen since ""The Lion King"". The actors are great, the claymation perfectly represents a wide range of emotions, and the writing is top notch.

His acting gave an impression that there weren't taken many re-shots...<br/><br/>From everything you could see that the film makers didn't have fun while doing this film and that's not the way to do animated films because the same feeling is reflected to the audience: Nobody was laughing at the cinema and the expression on the face of the children was more than disappointed."

As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but recall every family-oriented movie I've ever seen.  Now, having said that, before I saw the movie, I never once regarded it as a family movie, but after seeing the rehashed theme and uninspired love story, that's all I could think of it as.

","I haven't anything to add about the story proper. It is competent enough, though I suppose you need to know `The Great Escape.' The British loss of WWII is now complete, as we transform German prison guards into Welsh chicken farmers.<br/><br/>More interesting to me is what this film may mean for stop-action films. Not so long ago, filmmaker had two choices, something had to be real, or it had to be drawn. But the drawing was real too. Now, the advanced of computer-generated techniques is so great that soon it will be cheaper to make a computer-generated film than by any other technique. We'll still have the others, but only because of nostalgia. There'll be a demand for old-fashioned Disney-type films because we remember that world fondly.

It's seemingly based on a whole range of classic movies from the ""Great Escape"", ""Star Trek"" to ""Love Story"" with a score cannibalised from just about any/everything ever written by Messrs. Korngold/Williams & Bernstein all adding to this really super stop-motion animation that Ray Harryhausen would have been proud of.. A flock of chickens are relentlessly exploited for their eggs by the evil ""Mrs Tweedy"" - that is, until ""Rocky"" (an on-form Mel Gibson) arrives over the fence and incites escape plans... Meantime their malevolent owner (Miranda Richardson) has plans to industrialise production - and this time, not just of the eggs... It's a fun frolic, this - with great vocal performances from Jane Horrocks, Julia Sawalha and Benjamin Whitrow as the rather pompous RAF spotter chicken ""Fowler"". Nick Park and Peter Lord - and the wonderfully imaginative Aardman team - have built upon their ""Wallace and Gromit"" experience and created some charming characters with some great lines for both the young, and the formerly young.

I think the villain is a lot of fun, the animation is great, and it's just a fun film. But to me, it just feels like this movie had no reason to be as long it was, let alone be a theatrical release. I think the movie has too much filler, and skretches out it's simple story too long.<br/><br/>""Chicken Run"" is a good movie. I enjoy watching it, and despite it's problems, it's still a film I can watch many times. It's a fun little movie, and it's okay."

","Ginger the hen (Sawalha) is determined to escape from the battery farm where she and her fellow chickens live. She's held back by her meek comrades - until Rocky (Gibson), a wisecracking rooster, shows up and inspires them to new heights. But can they escape before the deadly Chicken Pie Machine gets up and running?
Don't anticipate any promotional tie-ins with KFC for an animated comedy in which chickens, forced to lay eggs or get the chop, plot to escape a farm where they are penned in behind barbed wire in conditions that definitely flout the Geneva Convention. Yes, it's a remarkably well-sustained spin on the popular P.O.W. camp movie, with a touch of The Squawkshank Redemptions about it, too.<br/><br/>With three Oscars for Park's shorts and a barrow load of awards between them, Lord, Park and the team at Bristol's Aardman can claim world supremacy in stop-motion clay animation. Hollywood money has enabled them to create a first full-length feature that is big and ambitious. That it is also very funny and imaginative owes more to love than finance, however.<br/><br/>The film is a tribute to the inspired lunacy that drives people to wave aside CGI, doggedly crafting models and moving them painstakingly through 24 poses for each second of film. Chicken Run has 563 feathered and costumed puppets, tons of plasticine, and meticulously constructed sets to set off the kind of ingenious details, endearing characters and riotous gags that made Wallace and Gromit international stars.<br/><br/>It also has a smart mix of nostalgia, sweetness and flip modernity in design and dialogue, playing with time-honoured types - a pair of rats to act as spies and scroungers, an old rooster named Fowler who constantly drones on about his days in the RAF and tut-tuts, ""Cock-a-doodle-do-what-what"" - situations and plotting. Puns also abound: Rocky is the self-styled Lone Free Ranger, Fowler claims the rank of Wing Commander.<br/><br/>Even the most hardened audience will erupt into cheers and applause for a dandy set piece inside the pie making machine - a sequence that recalls Indiana Jones fleeing the booby-trapped treasure chamber -and the hilariously spiffy climax. You can't help but love the delicious absurdity and dedication in a film that boasts a ""mouth and beak replacement co-ordinator"" among the crew credits. In the same spirit that has enshrined Babe as the Citizen Kane of talking pig movies, Chicken Run is definitely the Casablanca of chick flicks.<br/><br/>Chicken Run not only proves that Aardman animation can deliver a full-length feature with panache; it offers genuinely superb entertainment as well."

","Not being familiar with the creators of Wallace and Gromit, and not knowing anything about Aardman Productions, the biggest surprise for me was that the story takes place in England with a hen house full of British chickens and an American interloper by way of the circus named Rocky Rhodes. I thought this was a fun picture with a quite noticeable plot familiar to movie fans who've seen ""The Great Escape"". I liked the RAF guy Fowler; if someone had thought of it, the connection to the RAF might have been translated as the Royal Air Fowl, but who's to second guess? I even noticed something of a tribute to the world of Star Trek when Mrs. Tweedy grabbed the string of lights dangling from the escape plane, and one of the chickens sounded the alarm by saying 'it's a cling-on Cap'n'. Non-Trekkies wouldn't catch the reference. All in all a colorful and action packed, family friendly animated feature that's sure to please. I always come by these flicks so much later after their original run, but was glad to catch it before it flew the coop altogether."

","Chicken Run is great movie, but I won't count it as much of a DreamWorks movie than an Aardman animation one. The British humour is just too much to call it DreamWorks. Not necessarily Wallace & Gromit style, but its own style of dialougue and physical comedy. <br/><br/>The atmosphere we are presented to in the beginning is just unnerving, and with a solid performance by Miranda Richardson as the devilish Mrs. Tweedy topped with an almost constant feeling of peril a PG-rating might have fitted better. <br/><br/>Even though the movie has some intense action scenes, which are truly spectacular, and some dark atmospheric passages it also features some hilarious British humour and well acted charaters. Fowler and the two business rats were my favourites, they made me laugh several times. Mel Gibson as Rocky was not necessarily insufferable, but was too much of a generic douche who learns his lesson which you have seen many times before. Everything else is great, so that's just nitpicking.<br/><br/>Chicken Run is a thoroughly enjoyable and underrated flick which will keep you on the edge of your seat with great animation, great characters, fantastic action scenes and a reminder that stop-motion still has a place among top quality entertainment."

","Chicken Run
I have always enjoyed Claymation films and this movie is no exception. I appreciate the time and effort it took to make every scene of this movie. You must give the creators and artists credit for the love they must have had for this movie to be able to create this. One thing that I loved about this movie was how well sound was used. The sounds gave a very realistic feel to the film when in actuality it was a cartoon with a pretty unrealistic premise. I also thought the voice acting was very good and fit in well with the Claymation characters. This provided a good flow to the film. One thing that was very prominent in the film was cutting for continuity. One example of this is when Mr. Tweedy was building the pie machine. The film would cut to different parts of him building and repairing it to show the passage of time without taking time from the story that could be used elsewhere. I enjoyed the premise of the story too. It is very original and when it came out it had not been used very often. When I first watched this film when I was very young enjoyed its comedic elements and fast paced story. Watching it no, as an adult, I enjoy the humor of the jokes and many of the dramatic aspects that I did not quite pick up on as a child. I found that the fast paced story was very easy to follow but and kept the audience entertained, but it was not too fast as to feel rushed and incomplete. Chicken Run had a very Classical Paradigm in that its structure was very simple. This structure is very common in fiction movies and this is prime example. The story follows from the intro and introducing the film through the plot and finally to the climax and closing. One of my favorite scenes was when Rocky was in the pie making machine. In this scene a lot is going on. There is so much motion going on that you would think that you would become distracted and lose focus on the point but because of how it was filmed your eye is always drawn to Rocky and what he is doing. The story of this film may also be paralleled to the concentration camps of World War 2. The chickens representing the Jews and other captives and the Tweedys representing the Nazi's. As the chickens realize that the end is near they must find a way to escape from their oppressors. I believe that what the chickens felt during this film can be paralleled with the feelings of many of those who perished in the camps."
"evankennedyspaien","8","0","0","15 February 2018"," Chicken Run is an interesting tale with many elements
","The film Chicken Run is a masterpiece of claymation and comedy that provokes emotion and thought. While one would typically assume a light hearted movie about chickens defeating a deluded man who has little control over his life and a mean woman obsessed with profits would have little plot or thought points it is an interesting piece that alludes to world war two and american propaganda. As the story progresses the characters are fleshed out and shown to be a diverse group of individuals that are placed in a hostile concentration camp like world. Where every day is a fight to maintain the morale and hope of others to succeed in a place where only oppression lies. <br/><br/> As the movie develops the viewer understands more and more the hope emotions of these clay chickens attempting to alter their way of life to one that is free of the oppressive regime given to them. With the addition of the American Hero, Rocky we start to see the propagandist type of actions in this film. While the American Hero ideal is disproved the character is still shown to have heart and the ability to save the people demonstrating a satirical view of American ideals and values but still showing how they are able to help others and move past themselves when it is most valuable to others.<br/><br/>On the happier side of this story the characters are unique and fleshed out giving an interesting perspective into each character and how oppression affects the mind. For some people they can't understand how other humans or sentient beings in this case can be so negative and mentally either deny or snap as in the case of the propetuarilly knitting character, Babs. In others it instills the want to escape and take leadership of the rag tag groups of individuals that are all stuck together in this position to attempt to encourage both themselves from the depressing normal fate of this type of society. Some just take what they are given and decide this is what life is meant to be and that they are there for a reason and shouldn't bother to escape or go against their masters. Finally there are those that utilize fear and hope to manipulate others for personal gain as the rats and Rocky initially does. Overall the characters generate an interesting cast filled with psychologically unique and accurate characters while maintaining a humours facade of jokes and non human violence that allows this movie to be able to be enjoyed by both adults and children on different levels of analysis.<br/><br/>In addition to the contents of this movie it was shot extremely well and the attention to detail in this piece drew one in to be able to enjoy this movie. As a story it fulfilled the classic paradigm of a very clear antagonist and protagonist highlighted by color schemes and camera angle to portray these clay creations as realistic and either positive or negative beings. In addition to character development and placement each sequence was filled with motion and thought as the chickens altered from dynamic beings filled with personality to average chickens in an attempt to deceive their masters.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this movie immensely, it gave many possibilities for analysis and for simple enjoyment. As a movie I found that it fulfilled my want to enjoy a nice movie and laugh at the antics of these chickens and the failing plans of the dominating villains but also be able to see into the world if them and enjoy the thought provoking story of people attempting to hide the secrets of their escape from their dominating masters in a analogy to nazism. This paradigm allows for many different consumers to enjoy this movie."

","Outside of being the first full Claymation feature film, Chicken Run doesn't necessarily make of their characters or plot points particularly unique or innovative compared to other fiction movies. From a vague viewpoint, it keeps things pretty standard. However, everything the movie does it does well.<br/><br/>The movie starts with making the main conflict clear: the chickens want to escape; the farmers don't want them to escape. From the beginning, the protagonist and antagonist are established. As the film progresses, so does the tension and the complexity of the situation. A deuteragonist is established, the goals of the farmers change, etcetera. It all ends up building to the climax of the film, where they have to make their great escape. <br/><br/>Ginger is the protagonist; she is easily the most competent chicken and she's the one with the most determination to escape. She is selfless and wants freedom as much for the rest of the chickens as she does for herself.<br/><br/>Rocky is a deuteragonist with both protagonist and antagonist qualities - for the majority of the film he is trying to help the chickens on a face level, but in actuality he's lying about all of his accomplishments. Even though he could have escaped anytime he wanted, he didn't until the night before he would have been shown to the rest of the chickens as a phony. This shows that he liked the praise and feeling like he was helping, even if it was all a lie. By the end, he shows that his heart is in the right place by coming back and saving the day.<br/><br/>Mr. and Ms. Tweedy are the antagonists, with Ms. Tweedy playing as the main antagonist and Mr. Tweedy playing as a dumb sidekick. They try and build a machine to make chicken pies, which backfires on them greatly.<br/><br/>The editing in Chicken Run is very well done. The edits are seamless and there are many different perspectives and angles that all serve good purposes. Like most good editing goes, it's great because it keeps your attention focused by using various subtle techniques.<br/><br/>The script is well written. It blends humor with drama and adventure, and makes a prison break movie starring clay chickens something that's fun to invest your attention into. There is hilarity all throughout the film, whether it be the relationship between Ginger and Rocky, the relationship between Mr. and Ms. Tweedy, the entire existence of Babs, the visual references (Babs knitting a noose comes to mind), or the climax of the film, Chicken Run will keep you laughing throughout. Additionally, as the movie progresses you become legitimately attached to the characters. I found myself rooting for the main characters in this Claymation chicken film more than I have in many 'standard' movies.<br/><br/>With visual gags, solid humor, great editing and a wonderful Claymation art style, Chicken Run is overall a wonderful film. It does a great job at making the story clear and making the movie easy to follow, and it does an even better job of pulling the viewer in and making them interested in the story and the outcome. The Claymation is very well done, and they did a great job of making scenes that are very difficult to pull off look seamless and natural. Furthermore, they also did a great job of making the main characters noticeable from the rest of the chickens. Ginger wears a beanie, Rocky is a rooster, Babs has a unique hairstyle and is always knitting, etcetera. One could argue that it is a simple film, but I would say that it's not so easy to make a simple movie something truly enjoyable to watch. Chicken Run accomplished this and more, making a movie that is 90 minutes of pure fun."
"pjd-30106","7","0","0","15 February 2018"," A Wacky but Interesting Watch
","Although I have never been a huge fan of Claymation movies, Chicken Run has become an exception for me. Most of the movie follows a very traditional format, starting with an exposition, when the main character attempts to escape the first time, then accompanied by rising action, including numerous more escape attempts getting closer to their goal each time, until a climax is reached when the chickens escape. Following the climax, falling action and a resolution round out the end of the movie as the farm house blows up after the woman gets stuck in the machine. <br/><br/> Despite its many traditional qualities, this movie is still a good watch. Many unorthodox occurrences draw in viewers attention as the scape attempts grow stranger with each attempt. Another interesting aspect to this movie was the overarching use of classical cutting. This technique took what could've been a very underwhelming film and turned it into a suspenseful family-friendly drama. Numerous instance in the movie display this concept, and in each case, suspense and tension is added to augment the viewers experience. For example, in the very beginning of the movie Ginger, the main character is escaping from the farm. While digging under the fence, in an attempt to provide an escape route for her and her fellow chickens, Mr. Tweedy discovered her. The other chickens scurry back to their pens while Ginger is stuck outside the fence. Immediately after she was spotted, the chase was on. With Mr. Tweedy and his two dogs in hot pursuit the film switches between Ginger's point of view and Mr. Tweedy's. This technique increases the suspense of what otherwise would've been a simple chasing scene. It is the uses of concepts such as this that add to film in ways to augment the viewers experience.<br/><br/> Another interesting facet of this movie is its inter-genre story line. Incorporating pieces from numerous genres allows for a larger audience pool. Mainly utilizing features of comedic and dramatic films, Chicken Run plot uses somewhat comedic concepts to attract the attention of consumers. The wackier the concept, the closer attention will be payed to that scene. As the escape attempts increase in their uniqueness, the tension in watching film builds as viewers eagerly await to see if the attempt succeeds for fails in some extreme manor. In almost all the cases, the attempts would some how fail and result in something comedic rather it was Ginger being placed in solitary confinement again or another chicken falling victim to the growing anger of Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy. The endless suspense adds to the quality of the more making it a very interesting film to view. This property of the may not be a result of specific filming techniques, but I believe it adds to the overall make up of the movie and why it has been successful at the box office. <br/><br/> Perhaps my favorite part of this movie is not any one technique used to augment viewer's experiences, but rather the idea behind the movie. Taking such a simple complex and constructing such a complex movie with many twists and turns requires a lot of talent. As the plot progresses, the wackiness of the movie seems to increase. Starting with simple escape attempt ideas slowly but surely build into a one of a kind homemade flying contraption. Not only is the main idea of the movie strange, a group of chickens wishing to escape the grasp of ruthless farm owners, but each little part of the story adds to its very unique story line. With endless creativity this Claymation has become one of my favorites."
"jasonbogacz","8","0","0","15 February 2018"," I enjoyed this movie.
","Chicken run had me engaged and laughing for the entirety of the movie. It was a great film that invited you into the life of chickens on a chicken farm. The innocent humor and Claymation style of the movie can get anyone to laugh and appreciate the film simultaneously. I enjoyed watching the ongoing feud between the chickens and their farmer, Mr. Tweedy, while also watching the ongoing battle of Mr. Tweedy trying to prove to his wife, Mrs. Tweedy that the chickens are organized and smart, however she just thinks he's seeing things. The films detailed Claymation, cinematography, and humorous plot made for a great movie that almost anyone can enjoy.
The set and production of Chicken Run is spectacular. From the massive, clay 'concentration camp' layout of the chicken farm, to making dynamic scenes where people in the foreground and background are moving and blinking. I was amazed by the detail and quality of the stop motion work. The film uses many close-up shots that single out one character, making the stop motion process easier, however the filmmakers also used many wide-angle shots of the whole chicken farm, as well as shots of the inside of the chicken coops. Theses shots where extremely impressive because of the immense detail. Adjusting all the characters each frame, to make the movie seem more seamless and real is a painstaking process, and the hard work of Peter Lord and Nick Park shows and should be praised.
The directors developed characters very well, dozens of birds had well developed characters throughout the movie. Some tactics that were used to individualize so many different chickens were the morning roll call, and their secret meetings in the bunk houses. These scenes allowed for many different characters to have lines and develop their unique personalities. Aside from the chickens, Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy also had well developed characters, Mr. Tweedy's family was traditionally poor egg farmers, and Mrs. Tweedy was tired of it. Thus, another example of Mrs. Tweedy expressing anger and loathing towards Mr. Tweedy. Ongoing relationships between characters were also points of humor and plot development, for example Rocky and Fowler shared a bunk, and Mr. Tweedy was always catching Ginger trying to escape, and Fetcher and Nick were always trying to get eggs from the chickens. Small interactions like these are tactics for character development and often foreshadowing and plot development.
The plot of the film was very consistent and the film had little to no tangents or useless scenes that were away from the plot. The film slowly builds up to the chicken's massive plan to escape the farm, while the owners of the farm had their own agenda to start killing the chickens and making chicken pie. This created a humorous battle between the chickens and Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy. Also on top of that, Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy have their own comedic issues because Mr. Tweedy would always see the chickens scheming and doing humanlike things, but was never able to prove it to Mrs. Tweedy. Resulting in Mrs. Tweedy constantly getting angry at Mr. Tweedy. Although their bickering seemed like a tangent to the overall plot, it was often used as a tactic for plot advancement. 
Chicken run was a fantastic movie that I would recommend to anyone. It is innocent comedy that will make you smile and keep you engaged. The production quality is incredible, especially for a full-length Claymation film. The directors Peter Lord and Nick Park have set the expectation high for future Claymation films, and have created an amazing example of what is possible with stop motion films."
"kalebkronimus","9","0","0","15 February 2018"," A wonderful Film by all accounts
","The beginning of the film strongly sets the tone of the rest of the film. Using the first escape attempt to show that the situation of Ginger and her friends as effectively hopeless. <br/><br/>While I could see it being argued that the opening montages are supposed to just instill in us the great idea of hope that they all have. However the way the depict the entire setting shows me that we are to believe that hope is futile and escape is impossible. The very opening shot shows us a very literal prison camp. Anyone who did not know what they were going to watch would be surprised to find out that the grounds with barbed wire, rows of cabins, and a guard with terrifying dogs under the moonlight is actually just a chicken farm, and this lends to the comedic effect in a way but more importantly leaves you with a clear message: leaving is impossible. This gets enforced by the very entertaining montage of escape attempts that follow. The clever use of comedy to distract from the underlying hopelessness the characters face is masterfully done. The best part comes at the end of the first montage when the comedy fades. Suddenly nothing is funny, and a friend of theirs dies as is normal around there. Nothing has changed. For a moment there just isn't something funny to distract you from the gravity of the situation and it is very masterfully done. <br/><br/>The introduction of the character Rocky is both one of my favorite and least favorite moments of the movie. His arrival and the belief of the other chickens that he can fly leads the characters to have hope that as an audience we know is pointless. The chickens believe their situation has changed entirely, but we as an audience know that chickens can't fly and that they have false hope. This works to enforce the previously established message: Escape is impossible. But more importantly it raises tensions. As an audience it is in our nature to root for the protagonist so it causes a kind of stress to work towards something they won't achieve for such a long portion of the movie especially with an approaching deadline of sorts. we are left wondering ""How will they escape?"" because we desperately want to believe that they can and will escape. This build in tension is wonderful and effective, but is also slow taking roughly half the time of the movie in total. When it reaches its peak during Ginger and Rocky's escape scene within the pie machine we are left in a rift of sorts. With Rocky having left the next morning and all the chickens fighting we are feeling the same hopelessness as Ginger in that moment where we question if they can actually escape. And then my favorite part of the film is the race that follows. After all the previous tension built and was released we are now faced with this race against the clock. It has the same effect as the previous tension building section but occuring in a third of the time. And more importantly unlike the beginning of the film most of this new plan of the chickens being carried out occurred in sunlight filling the scene with bright colors and hope drawing on the power of mise-en-scène to affect how we perceive the events. And of course from there the film follows the usual steps of any classical story with a climax, etc. <br/><br/>Now I mentioned that Rocky's appearance in the film also highlighted my least favorite aspect of the film, and that aspect is an out of place romance. The character of Rocky is a typical masculine roll in charge, aloof, and confident. He is also uncomfortable with how assertive and in charge Ginger prefers to be. This is an archaic trope for films to have an in charge female character who will be ""Tamed"" and/or ""put in her place"" by a man and somehow that is romance. I won't fault Chicken Run for including the specific trope it is nearly twenty years old now however having a romance in general feels like a mistake. It was out of place with all the other themes. Missing the necessary elements to be a romantic comedy which requires the focus of the film to be on the two romanticized characters. It also seems contrary with the characterization and actions of the character himself. Rocky having done a lot of wrong and a little right came far from redeeming himself completely, and it all ended with a romance that felt wedged in between other great movie elements.<br/><br/>Overall Chicken Run is a wonderfully hilarious comedy borrowing elements from other serious movies like any other comedy but comes with unique ability to apply them effectively but is still not free from the film pitfall that all movies must contain the elements of a heteronormative romance."

","Chicken Run is, quite honestly, an egg-cellent work of comedy, and a movie that impressed me a lot more than I expected it to, and I highly recommend watching it if you haven't already.
I don't like summary, but to talk about it I should probably at least outline the film: it takes place on a chicken farm that is portrayed as a prison from the view of the chickens, who make up the bulk of the characters in the film. The movie is about the chickens and their various attempts to escape.
Ok, barebones summary out of the way, the movie does a bunch of things that blew me away and really impressed me. The first of these, and the most immediately apparent, is the visual style of the movie: it is entirely claymation. Now, the only times I had seen claymation used before, I...wasn't impressed with it. However, the way they do claymation in Chicken Run is amazing, in that it is simply so expressive and detailed. The love and hard work that the creators of the movie had poured into the clay figures was immediately apparent with how detailed they looked, in spite of their simple, cartoonish, looks--it honestly felt like I was watching a 3D version of one of the Saturday morning cartoons I watched as a kid. The amount of different poses, expressions, and even effects that the filmmakers were able to do astounded me, and honestly endeared me to this style of animation.
Beyond that though, the thing that I loved most about this film--and the aspect of the film that makes it stand out as much as it does--is the STELLAR writing in the film. I went in expecting a simple movie that was clearly intended for kids, and as a result the movie took me for one hell of a ride. This movie had me scared, mad, and sobbing at various points throughout, and even more often had me tearing up in laughter--but even better, I was invested in what was happening, a lot more than I am with more recent films. And honestly, this was due to the writing. The characters in the film, some of them one-notes though they may be, honestly felt so articulate and alive at times, and this was emphasized by the stellar voice work (the accent work fit each and every character to a T). I found myself getting so engrossed in their plight, and rooting for their success the entire time, and it was absolutely fantastic. Hell, I even was invested in the romance between Ginger and Rocky, as out of place as a romance subplot was in this movie--and normally I loathe out-of-place romantic subplots. But the best part is that I felt each and every character was done right, even the one-notes. For example, the antagonists were written to work perfectly with each other, and despite being farmers as the villains, still struck me with fear. The bumbling, fumbling, dunderhead that was Mr. Tweedy was an excellently-written foil to the dastardly and diabolical Mrs. Tweedy, yet even in scenes where Mr. Tweedy was the only antagonist present, he still felt menacing--something I applaud, honestly. I was also endeared to the other characters; from the silliness of the hens to the military rigidity of Ginger's father, to the rats, who were simultaneously lovable and hateable, I found myself loving each and every one of them.
The biggest praise that I can give to this movie, and the greatest testament I can provide that speaks to how good it is, is that even after watching it once I not only am able to applaud it so much, but also truly wish to applaud it. It is an excellent film, and I highly recommend it."
"etw-41261","8","0","0","15 February 2018"," Chicken Run Review
","Chicken run is in the details. What starts and ends as a parody of ""The Great Escape"" continuously picks up unique elements along the way, developing its own reputation as a solid, feel-good movie.
 
 Both Chicken Run and The Great Escape feature a collection of prisoners, summoned to roll call, living in numbered shacks in captivity. Both feature one character repeatedly trying to escape. Both feature the escaping character repeatedly being caught. When caught, both characters are put in solitary confinement, where both characters pass the time by bouncing a ball off the opposite wall. Both feature stealing bed slats to construct a tunnel as an attempt at escape. Both use a wood stove as the cover to the secret tunnel. Both feature the British Royal Air Force - In The Great Escape, all the prisoners are captured airmen; Chicken Run only features one RAF member. In a subtler reference, The Great Escape shows a character using his pants to sneak dirt out of the tunnel - Chicken Run shows a character using their pants to smuggle bolts and supplies in for the chicken's final escape attempt. The tunnel escape, However, is where Chicken Run begins to take on an identity of its own. The Chickens, unlike the captured british airmen, do not manage to escape.<br/><br/> Some plot points are fairly obvious to older viewers (Rocky can't fly) or unoriginal (Rocky's decision to return); however they provide clues that younger viewers will delight to find on their inevitable re-watches. The Hen House transforming into a plane, meanwhile, is a surprise I doubt many saw coming. Looking back, clues were provided - no view of the project during the construction montage but walls of the house - but the cinematography setup the surprise very well, showing construction without raising suspicion of what was being constructed.<br/><br/> The film accomplishes something very unique in terms of suspense. Younger audiences will realize the characters are risking death, and will be riveted. In most films targeted towards children, suspense will decrease as the viewing age increases. However, in Chicken Run, the older audiences realize just how gruesome the danger is. Suspense in Chicken Run, as a result, does not decrease with age. I found myself just as terrified at the pie machine as I was when much younger. As a child, death was constant - being trapped in the oven, falling into the blades, being crushed by the roller - all ended in the same result. As an adult, Roasting to death, being drawn into a woodchipper, and being trapped as a steam-roller draws nearer are all as if not more terrifying. Mrs. Tweedy being trapped in the gravy tank as the gravy level rose was particularly fear-inducing. In terms of suspense, Chicken Run provides something for all age levels.
 The small details presented in the film are what takes Chicken Run from a simple story to a beautiful piece of art. Most obviously are the numerous references to The Great Escape. Less obviously are little things, like the drive shaft of the delivery truck that brings the pie machine. Placing the camera on the ground pointed upwards to show the rotating parts underneath is an unnecessary item that helps keep the already engaging stop motion even more visually attractive. The two black market rats are named Nick and Fetcher respectively. ""Nick"" in british english means to steal, and ""Fetcher"" means ones who procures. The rats do exactly that, stealing items from the Tweedy's household to sell. Nick's character wears a suit jacket that zips up, with the zipper displayed prominently on the front. At first glance, it looks exactly like a tie. Inside the barn, an incredible amount of detail work went into the backgrounds and the pie making machine. Shovels lean against the walls, tools hang from boards, work benches accumulate dust. Gears and pipes span left and right, Metal supports have holes in them exactly as a real structure would. Chicken Run's small details make it a visual masterpiece, with every scene hiding something to look for. If the suspense and plot don't satisfy, watching for the hidden gems in the set certainly will."

","Chicken Run is an animated adventure, comedy movie by Peter Lord and Nick Park about a group of chickens trying to escape from the prison-like farm and its owners. The film is done entirely in Claymation like Wallace and Gromit which adds a unique feel to the story. Many of the scenes in this film stay as close to the characters as possible due to how much time it takes to set up large establishing shots. The use of a more close-up focus in the film is that it feels more grounded in what the characters were doing so it makes the movie feel like something is always happening. Along with that the movie uses classical cutting to go from the characters doing something to their surroundings during particularly the more climactic scenes. For example, the films cuts between Ginger and Rocky and the jammed gravy dispenser as they try to escape the pie machine all while having the gravy dispenser gradually build up towards an explosion. The cuts back and forth between the two build up tension in the scene while jus focusing on the characters would lessen the tension of their surroundings. Another example of their focus on the characters is at the start f the movie when it is a montage of Ginger trying to get all the chickens out and getting caught by the main antagonists Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy. This montage establishes the plot of the movie and most of the protagonists quickly by showing Ginger escape fairly easily but then having her get caught when she goes back to help the others, which demonstrates how she is selfless and wants to save all the chickens. The montage begins with an extended sequence where it begins with an establishing shot over the farm and Mr. Tweedy patrolling the fence with his dogs to establish how the farm is like a prison. Chicken Run is a movie that brings humor, fun action, and a unique style that blends well with the film-making to make a truly entertaining movie."

","When I was a kid, I practically ate this movie up as a kid, and watching now as a teenager, it still holds up very well. I've always admired stop-motion, and Aardman has always been quite gifted in crafting delightful characters, worlds and stories through the media. In the case with this film (which is their first feature-length film funny enough), it centers around a pack of chickens in a farm trying to escape said farm and live a peaceful life away from the cruel farmers who want to cook them to earn bigger profits. Along the way, a rooster accidentally lands in the farm, and he teaches them how to fly to escape said farmers. The result is a funny, charming, beautiful and at times emotional POW story that does great service to the likes of The Great Escape.<br/><br/>What's well contrasted about the chicken coup is that it also feels like a prison, creating a sense of terror and suspense for the chickens. Adding on to a well layered story, the jokes are very witty and add some spunk and charm to the characters. However, the film is also not afraid of getting dark, as whenever the farmers are near the chickens, you can only pray that those hens will get out of there alive. The attempts at sentimentality hit very well as we feel for the main hen Ginger and her goal to leave her horrid life and to get out and find a new home, something that many people stuck in horrible lives wish to fulfill.<br/><br/>Most if not all the characters are just delightful. Ginger is the smartest of all the chickens, is always thinking up each plan, and while she does have her disagreements with Rocky the rooster, they do grow more fond of each other and it's very sweet whenever they bond. Speaking of Rocky, while his arch is the typical liar revealed story line you'd find in other films, he does grow a soft side for the hens and his snarky attitude only fits in to how charming he is. As for the other hens, they range from amusing and smart witted like Gabs and Mac to more stubborn like Bunty and Fowler, but that fits in to the contrasting views of what they can do to escape. Oh yeah, and the rats Nick and Fletcher are madly amusing and do help the chickens out, so they're good in my book.<br/><br/>And then there's Mrs. Tweedy, the co-owner of the chicken farm and wife of the absent-minded albeit occasionally demanding Mr. Tweedy. She is so threatening from her appearance that whenever she's on screen, she gives me goosebumps. Add on her ferocious dogs and you've got a villain who will stop at nothing to get what she wants, and in this case, to turn all her chickens into pies to gain higher salaries...seriously, don't mess with Tweedy.<br/><br/>Technical wise, this movie is marvelous. The sets look well detailed, the characters are in the usual simple yet amusing Aardman style, the effects are superb, and the flying scenes are just...stellar. Even though this was Aardman's first feature film, they went all out in crafting a great setting for where the film's core is, and they never hold back in giving the characters such unique and layered body expressions. Oh, and the gravy machine....pure masterpiece.<br/><br/>And last but certainly not least, the music score. Harry-Gregson Williams and John Powell tangle with an upbeat lively score and a more suspenseful heist score that really add to the tension of each scene. <br/><br/>There are many solid works in England when it comes to animation, and Chicken Run is no exception. While the liar revealed story and the occasional dodgy character play afloat, the film's solid animation, lovable cast of characters, well layered story, and charming score really make it a solid flick worth watching. If you have a kid of your own, pass this film on to them, and maybe then they'll have a favorite of theirs from their childhood that they'll stay forever attached to."

","Chicken run really has what could have been a very corny, immature, and, possibly, tasteless premise, and easily have just been a very stupid, loud, colourful mess that shuts kids up. Actually, this film doesn't settle for that, it actually has a lot of intelligence, charm, subtlety, legitimately emotional scenes, and could even be quite morbid at times. This film is one I recommend to all ages. Fans of POW movies can get a kick from it, kids can enjoy it, as can anyone else. The plot is very erratic, but in a good way and keeps you guessing, until it leads to a climax you certainly won't see coming. Idealistic and natural hatched lead hen ginger, her intelligent, scatterbrained, and slightly insane Scottish assistant Mac, wise old veteran rooster fowler, muscular, loudmouthed, and cantankerous bunty, and endearingly ignorant babs hatch feckless scheme after feckless scheme, in a bid to liberate the farm's vast chicken flock. However, ginger and the gang are stopped at every turn by the callous and tyrannical Willard tweedy, and his pair of attack dogs. The farm is low on funds, and any hen who cannot produce eggs is decapitated, and eaten by the two farmers. However, a rooster, known as rocky the Rhode island red, who is capable of flight, crashed into the farm one fateful night, and has to take time to heal his broken wing, while, after threatening to return him to circus he came from by ginger, is forced against his will into verbally teaching the hens to fly. He agrees, yet harbours a dark secret. To worsen matters, the head of the farm, the highly-ambitious and Sociopathic melisha tweedy, Willard's domineering and business-minded wife, has lofty aspirations of becoming a wealthy pie-manufacturer, and without a shred of empathy, intends on turning the entire flock into pie filler. Time is ticking, and the hens MUST learn to fly, before their goose is cooked. Assisting them are two hilarious rats, nick and fetcher. Nick is intelligent and suave, fetcher is slightly unhinged and mentally distant, yet they eagerly help the hens, in exchange for seed, and if they are expected to work Harder than usual, then they demand eggs. The characters all have depth, quirks, and it is shown through their actions, not just sitting around and blabbing exposition. The animation is very aesthetic, allowing for a lot of well- timed slapstick and hilarious eggs-xpressions."

","CHICKEN RUN is a pretty decent feature-length animation from Aardman, directed by WALLACE & GROMIT creator Nick Park. I found it only second to THE WRONG TROUSERS in terms of quality, as for the most part this is a funny, action-packed tale with a decent storyline and effective larger than life characters.<br/><br/>The story is about a bunch of chickens hoping to escape from a chicken farm and the American rooster that comes by and helps them. It doesn't sound like much on paper - your typical kid's production in fact - but in terms of execution this is a piece of visual excellence. I particularly loved all of the references to WW2 prisoner of war films, most notably THE GREAT ESCAPE, which alone kept me watching.<br/><br/>The story isn't too kiddified and some of the jokes are pleasingly mature. There's a little too much random slapstick but the American influence is low and the film has a strong British feel and sense of humour. The cast members acquit themselves very well with the material, and even shoehorned-in Mel Gibson is a fine choice for the lead. In the end, Nick Park's tireless work pays off here, and the result is that rarity: a modern-day children's film I can enjoy time and again."

","Filmed entirely using Claymation technology (the same style used for the Wallace and Gromit animations), gave Chicken Run a different feel to your usual animated movie. The animation certainly isn't to everybody's taste, it doesn't look as impressive or as polished as standard animation but for me it wasn't a problem, within a few minutes I was completely used to it and barely noticed it to be different from then on.<br/><br/>An almost all English cast worked well for the movie with the only American being Mel Gibson, playing Rocky the Rooster. This created the opportunity for the chickens to look up to the Rooster as some sort of celebrity, a foreigner who was like something they had never seen before.<br/><br/>There are many references to great British movies through the film, some of which I picked up on and others which I have read of since watching it. Chicken Run does have a strong British feel to it, however I can't help but feel that just the inclusion of one American character made it feel a little too American. Mel Gibson stood out like a sore thumb, now I'm not saying he didn't fit the part and play a vital role, I just think that some of the jokes and amateur dramatics would have been better suited to the movie if they were a little less Americanized.<br/><br/>On the most part the comedy is fresh and I found myself laughing on several occasions. It's a feel good flick; it's as simple as that. Its relatively predictable and plays out containing all the clichés you would expect from a movie of this genre. <br/><br/>Overall, It isn't a perfect movie and I don't feel it contains any real wow factor and it misses the mark on any real emotion in my opinion. However the casting is done well enough, the jokes hit the mark on the most part, the animation is impressive when you consider the effort it must have taken to produce it and it is a decent way to pass the time on a rainy Sunday Afternoon, as I did.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Ginger is a chicken in a small egg farm, where the two owners, rather harmless, bumbling Mr. Tweedy and cruel, sadistic Mrs. Tweedy are strict and quick to butcher any hen who doesn't make the quota each day. When Mrs. Tweedy discovers an ad for a new system that makes mass-produced meat pies, the greedy couple realize that if they use the chickens for food rather than eggs, they'll pay their bills faster and can afford more. Ginger and her friends have all become very depressed, knowing that their fate is coming sooner than later... until a rooster from the Untied States who escaped from the circus lies to Ginger about being able to fly, giving the hens a small ray of hope. With the help of two rats, the well-meaning rooster tries to teach every hen to fly... will the group make it out of the Tweedy farm alive? Chicken Run may not have been intended for children. It shows in detail the slow-killing machines within a factory farming system, shows a hen being decapitated, all sorts of disturbing scenes that may be more for adults who want to know about the cruelty of factory farming. For anyone who doesn't know, factory farming is using farm animals (cows, chickens, pigs, geese, etc.) in cruel, uncomfortable and unsanitary conditions. These animals rarely, if ever, get exposed to the outdoors, and when they are killed for food it often involves processes that kill the animals slowly, leaving them suffering from anywhere between seconds to an hour or so before they pass away completely. I'm not one of those P.E.T.A. activists or anything, but killing any sentient being in a sadistic way seems wrong.<br/><br/>The animation in Chicken Run was very different, animated by the British company that released Flushed Away and Wallace & Gromitt. The soundtrack wasn't exactly the type of music I'd listen to while driving to work but it was certainly catchy, and the voice cast was well-chosen. It has one or two crude humor jokes but is otherwise very funny without the use of them, and it's funny to watch the Tweedy Couple as the hens fight back for freedom. Still, it's hard not to feel sorry for Mr. Tweedy, who doesn't really enjoy harming the chickens, when he lets his wife get squashed to death because he was sick of her constant abuse and greed.<br/><br/>What ever happened to movies like this? These days it's garbage like Frozen (2013) and The Hunger Games (2012), that's popular, it's incredibly annoying. If you really want to see something original, have a love for morbid comedy, animal rights, original animation or all of the above, check out this movie!"

What I really liked about this movie is the creative ways the hens tries to escape from the egg farm and the interactions between the characters. It really brings out the classic chemistry and dialogues that actually made me sort of care about the cause. Maybe because it subtly makes references to other classic movies. The message might come off as subtle to some, but I liked the message of breaking through the barrier and the comfort zone for something more in life. Mel Gibson as Rocky the rooster didn't really add all the much to the core of the story in my opinion. But for a stop-motion animated comedy.

How can we veer away from stuff that will be 'inappropriate' for children? How this, how that? How do we do this in order to do that? How do we edit this so that we can obtain that? How can we make this? How can we do this? How will this work? How will we make this not look like this? How, how, how. But Chicken Run does the impossible; chicken: impossible.

""What are you talking about?"" Well.. instead of making an animation full of the overdone CGI effect, Chicken Run does it old-school style at makes it a stop-motion animation. I really loved this aspect, because it never wanted to be what others have been. And it was like watching something different from an animation.. The voice acting was really well-done. I loved the character of Rocky voiced by Mel Gibson. He gives the character his signature voice by adding his charismatic attitude and fun. The supporting cast all did an equally great job, and there was no complaints in this department.. The plot was quite different. The place where the chickens are imprisoned resembled a concentration camp used back in the Holocaust. While this may at first question the viewers, it was more of a satirical comment more than a hurtful one. I, for one, went along with this animation (key word: animation) and enjoyed the hell out of it. It was fun and inventive, where have you heard that before? Then the whole escape plot (using key plot devices from other films, making this film part animation, part parody) was really funny and cool. The whole 'inside the machine' scene was genius. The whole film reflected off this scene right here... And the movie was cleverly-written! Every scene contained a cleverly done joke that may be too clever for our own good. The writers took time and patience in order to create this hilarious experience, because I took full advantage. <br/><br/>I loved Chicken Run. It's was cleverly directed, written, and acted to a point where you will question if it's TOO clever. Warning: the film may not be for everyone.

","If you think that Wallace and Gromit were Nick Park's only good creations, you are definitely wrong. Creature Comforts is also another of his successes, and this film ""Chicken Run"", the first Aardman feature film, ensures he pulls through with a clean track record. Not a duff project has come from him yet - even the Wallace and Gromit movie was great. This film is a simple idea - chickens trying to escape from their cruel masters - turned into a great film, with plenty of humour and fun to be found along the way. The film is also technically great - the animation we have come to expect from Aardman is top notch, as testified to by the scenes inside the pie machine and several of the escape scenes. The film manages to reach a very satisfying emotional conclusion - and there are a wide variety of characters to be found. The two gangster rats (I've forgotten their names) add a sense of corruption and cunning to the chicken coop, Mrs. Tweedy makes for quite a menacing, evil villain, unlike her rather oafish husband. Ginger is good as the main character and the person who we follow throughout the whole film. The scene at the start where the chicken was taken away and killed was about as dark and sinister as we can expect from animated films - low music and a general sense of fear really add a dark side to it. And there's real voice talent in the form of Mel Gibson as Rocky - the American chicken who isn't all he claims to be... With the way things are going after Flushed Away (which was a great film but underperformed at the box office), Aardman have yet to produce a duff film. Hopefully, that will never happen. 9/10"

You could make parallels with Nazi films, industrial society in which we're all ""caged"" even race and gender relationships. Jana L.

","""Chicken Run"" is a great film, but it has i's weaknesses. The ""clay animation, for example, is a bit faulty. The story is great, and the voice actors/actresses put a great performance on, especially Mel Gibson, who is really the only actor of the lot that I'm familiar with. **Minor spoiler ahead** Gibson plays Rocky, a cocky American rooster who wants freedom from the circus, and crash-lands into a chicken farm,complete with 50 or so chickens. Plus, a British cock who talks likehe's still in the Army. The chickens are basically tortured into laying eggs by the Tweety's, who's farm is going downhill. Mrs. Tweety gets equipment to turn ""those stupid creatures"" into pies. Mr. Tweety is incredibly stupid, bu ends up being the smarter one of the two. Ginger is the leader of the chickens, and she helps the chickens fly for freedom. ""Chicken Run"" is a classic example of a fun movie. I would recommend it for people who love good comedy. My Score: 8/10."

","I never used to like animated films, but over the past five years or so; there's been more and more good ones being released, and these days I enjoy nearly all the ones I see. The majority of animated films are either in 2D, or just lately; computer generated, but there's something about clay models that's more appealing. Perhaps it's the fact that you know just how much effort must have gone into every second of film. The team of Nick Park and Peter Lord; the duo behind the immensely popular 'Wallace and Gromit' have put 'Chicken Run' together, and that's completely obvious throughout. The plot line takes in numerous film tributes, including some small ones to likes of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Easy Rider - but mainly, the whole film is a tribute to the British classic 'The Great Escape'. We follow the trials and tribulations inside of a chicken coup, as the chickens try their best to escape the iron fence that keeps them prisoner. Their efforts are unsuccessful, until one day a hip chicken named Rocky flies into the pen...could he be the answer to their prayers? <br/><br/>Chicken Run works, chiefly, because of it's vitality, and the way that it features enough fun for children, and enough attention to detail to ensure that adults will enjoy it, too. The characters benefit from a great troop of voice actors that succeed brilliantly in bringing life to their characters. Many of the actors are lesser-known stars, but the likes of Miranda Richardson, Julia Sawalha and, of course, Mel Gibson stand out the most. The film always flows well, and even through it has a short running time (understandable, when you consider how much work goes into every frame), you really feel like you've seen a story unfold by the end of the film. The characters here are a lot more deep and detailed than in a lot of 'serious' films, that's for sure! There's a big enough range of humour on offer here to ensure that everyone watching will get a laugh, all in all making Chicken Run a very difficult film not to like. As mentioned, I'm not really into animated films; but there are exceptions, and Chicken Run is definitely one of them."

","Chicken Run is a comical, 'The Great Escape'-like film featuring claymation chickens. The chickens need to escape their prison-like hen-house. They are led by an American rooster called Rocky and a hen with an English accent named Ginger.<br/><br/>Chicken Run is packed with action, comedy, and likable characters. It is a film for all ages. Adults can also enjoy the other film references to 'The Great Escape', 'Braveheart', and others. The animation is also very good, and it's much better than what computers can do. (I suppose that it's so easy to complicate computer animation while this claymation technique is kept simple, not over-worked, and has a more aesthetic and not-so-perfect appeal.) Technique aside, Chicken Run is a very clever and witty film.<br/><br/>This is a highly recommended film for any age or gender. Sit back and enjoy the humor and imaginative story that unfolds in claymation form."

","Chicken Run directed by Peter Lord and Rick Park was an inspiring and movingly funny movie that would catch and keep the attention of almost any cartoon loving, popcorn eating couch potato. The plot of the movie was sit in a world war two like concentration, labor camp where the majority of labor was simply laying enough eggs to stay alive. The major objective of the egg laying coup were to avoid the chopping block while trying to formulate, and execute an escape plan not for just one chicken but for all. Using everything at their disposal, collective intelligence, bargaining and team work the Chicken Run story demonstrates the importance of persistence, team work, ingenuity and a little luck to change their surroundings while simply trying to get to the other side. I really liked this move and the comedy Nick and Fletcher the mouse equivalent of Dumb and Dumber brought to this movie and of course Ginger whom at times seemed very blond."

","Kind of a pedestrian concept, but nicely executed by Aardman animation. I don't think the film would have nearly as funny in cel animation or computer animation; claymation gives the characters more, well, character.<br/><br/>Aardman's character designs are consistently a big boost to the enjoyability of all their films, from the near-abstract characters in Rex the Runt to the sheep of Wallace and Gromit, and now these teapot-shaped chickens. Much of the physical humor wouldn't have come across nearly so well with a different chicken design.<br/><br/>It's odd; the trivia section reports that Gibson recorded his dialogue in the U.S., while the rest of the cast recorded in the UK. It seemed to be, while watching the film, that he wasn't really part of the cast. He didn't seem to have as much depth of personality as even most of the 'supporting' chickens did, and far less than the rats. Maybe it was his voice. I heard that voice and saw Mel Gibson. When I heard the other characters speak, I saw chickens or rats or farmers. Maybe it's an argument against having one A-list star in an animated movie, when the rest of the cast is largely unknown (to American audiences; I'd be intrigued to know if UK viewers thought the same way).<br/><br/>Still, a wonderful, funny film, well worth a rental or even adding it to the collection."

","OK, I made a mistake in an another review. For the review of 'Shrek,' I hastily claimed that it was (along with the Toy Story movies) the only worthwhile animated features of the past 10 years or so. I failed to mention two other features: 'A Nightmare Before Christmas,' which I covered alreadyÂ… and this film. As the title of this review states, the movie is a loosely-based version of 'The Great Escape.' It's Aardman and Nick Park at the wheel, the 'Wallace and Gromit' team. I love the Wallace and Gromit cartoons so much that I actually had too high of expectations to immensely enjoy this film at the time. Nevertheless, in retrospect it is a very charming film.

","""Chicken Run"" tells the story about a group of chickens who desperately want to escape captivity at Mrs. Tweedy's Chicken Farm, in England.  Mrs. Tweedy (voice by Miranda Richardson) is not a nice old lady chicken farmer.  She takes her business very seriously.  When a hen does not lay an egg daily, she is condemned to the chopping block.  It is a matter of life and death for the hens to escape.  Unfortunately for them, they run through one failed escape attempt after another.  One of the more out going hens, Ginger (voice by Julia Sawalha), has tried many attempts to escape.  She has tried tunnels, catapults and disguises only to be chucked into the coal hole for a week as her punishment.  Mr. Tweedy (voice by Tony Haygarth) is positive that the chickens are scheming and planning, but can not seem to convince his wife.  Tired of making miniscule profits, Mrs. Tweedy decides to phase out the egg operation in exchange for a chicken pot pie operation. Fortunately for the chickens, Rocky the Flying Rooster (voice by Mel Gibson), an American Rhode Island Red Rooster, literally drops in on the farm -  just in time to save the chickens from becoming pot pies.  Rocky is on the run from the circus.  In the end, the birds are able to escape from Mrs. Tweedy's to a nearby bird sanctuary.<br/><br/>Peter Lord and Nick Park directed ""Chicken Run"".  The intention for this movie was not just to entertain, but also to demonstrate that with hard work and determination almost anything can be accomplished (no matter what species).  It also displays charm.  Even though the chickens kept failing, it kept the audience hopeful for the characters, wanting them to continue on and be successful.<br/><br/>""Chicken Run"" is the first feature length work done by Lord and Park in Claymation.  I loved the meticulous details they had used.  For instance, the way the mud on the ground was after it had rained to the gray in Mrs. Tweedy's hair made it look real.  Even the sound effects made it seem life like.  The way Mrs. Tweedy walked in her rubber boots and the way the doors slammed shut on the hen houses.  This is a very delightful and brilliantly made movie."

","The creators of Chicken Run! Also brought us, more recognizable to Americans, the Chevron talking cars.  Directed by Nick Park and Peter Lord, it stars the voices of Julia Sawalha as Ginger the oxymoronically fearless chicken leader, Mel Gibson as Rocky the Flying Rooster, Jane Horrocks as Ginger's bungling friend, Babs, and Miranda Richardson as the diabolical Mrs. Tweedy, owner of the chicken farm. When Mrs. Tweedy hatches a plan to turn her under-achieving egg-layers into pot pies (complete with gravy and... MIXED VEGETABLES!), Ginger must muster the hens into escape mode. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a plumper task than she had anticipated, and it's up to Rocky -- straight out of the traveling circus -- to further inspire the break-out from the seemingly in-egg-scapable Tweedy's Farm!<br/><br/>To fly right out of the coop, you're in for sheer entertainment! Combining elements of painfully meticulous clay animation (some 24 moved poses in one SECOND of film!), dynamite voicing by the ensemble cast, and one of the most hysterically well-written screenplays you'll experience this summer, Chicken Run will surely go down as a 2000 movie to remember. What's more, it's Rated G -- making this a joyride for the entire family. Not a whole lot of films that year could make that claim. So you're worried that it's rated G huh? You don't have to worry! In fact, adults could conceivably find it even more entertaining than kids. Think Aladdin; think The Lion King; think Beauty and the Beast; then think of all the fun YOU had while watching each of these. And though all of these films I mentioned are Disney, Dreamworks could very well be an integral part in the next evolutionary step in family entertainment. Though the Steven Spielberg/Jeffrey Katzenberg/David Geffen producing conglomerate has sponsored animated features before (The Prince of Egypt and Antz both in 1998, and last year's The Road to El Dorado), Chicken Run is so much more accessible, palatable, and just unadulterated fun than its predecessors.<br/><br/>Is there anything not to like about Chicken Run? There is so little, I have trouble even mentioning it. But then again, it is my job to be thorough. With that said, the story did tend to lull around the middle, but only somewhat. If you start feeling bored in places, do me a favor: Take a look at it from a different angle and admire the technical work that went into those characters. If you're not amazed by that, then very little will thrill you.<br/><br/>And for you movie buffs out there, let me add to your entertainment dollar if I may -- play the ""How Many Movie References Can I Spot?"" game. First off, since the film is essentially about breaking out of captivity, expect to see homages/references to just about every great prison escape movie out there. Scenes are staged and shot with an uncanny sense of detail to make you sit up and say, ""OH! That's from, that's from....""  But the allusions don't stop with prison movies. If you somehow manage to hear most of the dialogue through the laughter, you may catch a few things that even the most seasoned film buff will miss, and you'll pat yourself on the back for it without feeling the least bit of conceit!<br/><br/>It's the multi-tiered grade A quality that makes the movie one of the most well-rounded films out there right now -- a rarity coming from a major studio these days. Run out and enjoy the chickens!"

They try burrowing under the fence, jumping over it, various means of walking through it. They form plan after plan after plan. And if the film had stuck to that simple plot, it could have been truly worthy of the creator of Wallace and Gromit.<br/><br/>But sadly that wasn't enough. We had to have Mel, the obligatory American insert. In this film he dilutes the humour, defuses the horror, distracts the plot and reduces the whole. Why?

","Perhaps I'm biased.  I lived in Yorkshire for some years, so perhaps that may give me a little better understanding of the humor than most Americans will have (not to mention a slightly better grasp on the accents, though they were pretty clear).  And I have been a fan of the Wallace and Grommit work for some time - I think EVERYONE should see ""A Close Shave"" unless they've had their sense of humor surgically removed.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm biased, but I don't think so, as the entire theater was laughing as hard as I was.  This film is just tremendous, and I have a feeling that Mel Gibson's _The Patriot_ is going to have some of the hardest competition in his other film, _Chicken Run_.<br/><br/>Whether you have kids or not, see this film!  Of course the slapstick and animation will appeal to them, but there is enough sophisticated comedy and appeal to this film that anyone can enjoy it.  And to the perceptive who have watched all the ""serious"" great escape films, (and to the perceptive who just love Brit comedy) there are many subtle stabs.<br/><br/>This is the best ""film for everyone"" that I've seen in a long time."

","How appropriate that the distribution company is Pathe -- a company that pretty much does not exist in the United States anymore -- whose logo is a rooster.<br/><br/>One of the first clues that there are going to be a lot in-jokes and humour that not everyone will quite 'get' is right at the beginning: it is a shot of a rather miserable hut with the number `17' painted on the front; a quiet reference to the film `Stalag 17.'<br/><br/>Quite a bit of the film is very British-oriented and American audiences may not understand the humour.  As an example:  `chocks' or `chockies' is British slang for chocolates.  When Fowler yells to `Remove the chocks.' it is the well-recognized triangular box of Toblerone chocolates that the hens remove that are used to block the wheels.<br/><br/>Sight and word puns and gags abound -- far too many to remember let alone enumerate.<br/><br/>One of the nicest surprises is Jane Horrocks, who essentially reprises her role as Bubble' from `Absolutely Fabulous' -- only as a scatter-brained chicken with a knitting addiction instead of a scatter-brained secretary.<br/><br/>Julia Sawalha, also from `Absolutely Fabulous' fame, does a wonderful job voicing  Ginger' the motivating force and heroine -- or is that `henoine' -- of the film?<br/><br/>This `Poultry in Paradise' film has something for everyone. the soundtrack is good, though not outstanding; but the animation is flawless.<br/><br/>It is one of the few films I have been to where the (small matinee) audience cheered when the villains got what they deserved and most of the audience stayed through the end of the credits.<br/><br/>It is a must see movie that is touching, funny and magnificently executed."

Happily this has not happened as CR-1 easily meets the high standards of story and characterization that W&G set.  Of course the animation and set design is outstanding but I had little fear in this area - with more money to work with it seemed only natural that the visuals could only improve.  The only problem I can see is that kids may not think chickens are 'cool' and would rather see the latest Pokemon feature.  This would be a tragic waste as, like Iron Giant of last year, CR-1 is the quality children's movie that I hear so many parents complaining that Hollywood doesn't produce!  Well here it is folks!

","I was speechless (with laughter) after The Wrong Trousers and I loved Nick Park's other shorts, especially the languid leopard from Creature Comforts.<br/><br/>So, I'm upset that Chicken Run didn't work for me, though it had lots of fun moments and a good ending. A few things bugged me:<br/><br/>1. The camerawork jokes on various movies drew attention to the clay medium, without allowing the characters to play around with being unreal. It broke my identification with the characters.<br/><br/>2. Emotional scenes were played very straight. Giving Ginger the hiccups when she gets feeling lovey would have been a great bit. Or SOMETHING.<br/><br/>3. ""Look, chickens doing ..."" is maybe too old a joke. I laughed when the rabbit leans on the hunter's gun and says, ""What's up, Doc?"" After that ... even Gromit's joke was never ""how's Gromit going to do this undogly thing,"" but ""EEEK Gromit-the-dog is doing this completely ludicrously impossible thing!""<br/><br/>4. There's a big difference, masked by tricky animation technique, between the ""holy s---!"" moments of The Wrong Trousers and the ""yeah, and, what?"" moments of Chicken Run.<br/><br/>5. Too long. The slower pacing drew too much attention to the medium, see #1.<br/><br/>I think the good lessons of the Wallace and Gromit films and of Babe (where ""pigs can't be sheepdogs!"" was a serious ideological problem) were not properly applied in Chicken Run. I'd like Aardman Animations to stay away from feature films until they've maybe done some cheap live action movies and feel comfortable satirizing feature films, from start to finish."
"Denver53","7","0","0","26 June 2000"," A for effort, but 6 to 7 for rating
","Chicken Run is a refreshing change of pace visually. And it doesn't take long to get past the clay-mation-like figures and see them as characters, not special effects. Where Chicken Run fell short was character development. While a few of the chickens had some personality, all of them (with the exception of Ginger) were so one-dimensional that really, if they didn't escape from the farm, it would have been OK with me.<br/><br/>Now, I realize how ridiculous it is to discuss character development for clay chickens. To be honest, I'm having trouble choosing the right words here. But when I left Chicken Run I felt right off that the movie had missed a chance to be an instant classic, and I have been pondering why.<br/><br/>It certainly isn't the special effects. They were interesting, almost endearing in their three-dimensional reality vs. the pathetic ( in my opinion) Pokeman-level animation that seems to be in vogue today.<br/><br/>
It isn't the plot, which was cute and serious (deadly serious) at the same time. The chickens must escape or die. And the always dreaming Ginger keeps things moving with her constant attempts to escape and find someplace better for not just herself, but for the other chickens. <br/><br/>So what felt empty? To me, it was the character of the chickens themselves. Now, chickens don't have much depth, I know. But these were movie characters! They should pop out, make you identify with them even if they are clay chickens! But only Ginger (and the effectively profit-hungry and evil Mrs. Tweedle) created a presence. The other chickens has a one-dimensional personality that quickly grew predictable and tiresome.<br/><br/>For example, take the ""stupid chicken"" (I can't believe I am writing this). I forget her name ... Henrietta? She is always knitting and completely missing the point of anything. She never changed. Or take the old war veteran rooster. He is pompous and a bit lost and never changes, either. Even Rocky the rooster changed only in the most cliched of all ways ... coming back from his freedom to help Ginger and her pals escape. If any of these characters had shown some growth, it would have made for a better movie. It also could have used some funnier lines, though the general lack of pop culture jokes (oh sure, there were a few Star Trek lines) was a relief.<br/><br/>One other thing stuck out rather jarringly at the end. Without giving the plot away, Ginger seems surprised that the retired war veteran rooster can't fly a plane. Uh, he is a rooster. Ginger seems perfectly aware that human society is a bird of a different feather (a-hem) and has never seen a rooster or chicken fly anything. She's too smart to be blind as to believe that roosters flew human planes. That seemed weird to me.<br/><br/>Still, despite the predictable ending, Chicken Run was fun (well, the second half was much more lively than the first half; about 30 minutes into a 1:10 p.m. show my wife fell asleep) and so different than anything now out there. It also had a noble message about dreaming and improving ones life. Best of all, it wasn't Disney. For that reason alone, go see it."

The humor in Chicken Run is based around young children but contains many references mostly older kids and parents will enjoy.  Such as the elaborate references to Star Trek and Indiana Jones. The animation is spectacular.  They managed to show more emotions and depth will claymation characters than most movies.  The jokes, while simple and silly physical humor most of the time, were delivered just right so that you had to laugh. The creativity with the camera-work shows that the animators really put their hearts into this.

Winking its eye at cultural diversity, and the animosity that oftentimes goes along with it, was a clever move, and makes for some of the best jokes in the film.  The English covering up feelings of inferiority by denouncing the ""Yanks"" and the ""Yanks'"" cockiness (pardon the pun) and naivety of other cultures are both put on vivid display here, all for the sake of a few good laughs.  Then there's the romance, the sexuality (yes, sexuality - with chickens!) and the violence.  Throw in a good dash of action, an inspired scene straight out of Indiana Jones' 101, in particular, and you have the ingredients for one of the most entertaining animated movies in years.  An over-abundance of failed escape scenes drag the film down a bit.  Watching a few dozen chickens trying to escape from their ""prison"" is only amusing so many times, before it starts seeming like filler-material.

Some funny spots, even some mildly interesting ones-- but except for a few isolated highlights, the whole thing was a bit vapid. Kind of empty. I thought of it a bit like Jello (gelatin desert): It's colorful, it jiggles, it can have nice shapes, but after all of that, it's not much.<br/><br/>Contrast this movie with the recent family & kids' movie, ""My Dog Skip."" Even with its occasional contrivances, ""My Dog Skip"" was a real story about real people in real situations. Think of it as eating fresh strawberries. ""Chicken Run,"" on the other hand, was like strawberry flavored Jello. Not a bad thing-- hey, I eat it!-- but not actually real, either. And therefore not actually satisfying.<br/><br/>For those who wonder if animation can be made into an engaging movie-- go and see ""Titan A.E.,"" or either of the ""Toy Story"" movies or any number of other animated movies from Japan, Disney Studios, Warner Bros, and others-- there's lots of good stuff out there. In summary, ""Chicken Run"" was VERY well done technically, and it's moderately entertaining, but it left me craving more dramatic/comedic nourishment, too.

"Dkish","9","0","0","9 June 2000"," It's an ingenious little adventure
","The creators of the British animated classic `Wallace and Gromit' bring their magic to a full length feature. It's an ingenious little adventure that follows the hopes and dreams of a chicken named Ginger (Julia Sawalha). Her dream is to escape Mrs. Tweedy's chicken farm. She claims she can do it on her own but what bewilders her is that she is afraid for all her fellow fowl within the coop. So their plan focuses upon all of them in one huge jail-break. Ginger's prayers seem to be answered when a `flying' rooster named Rocky (Mel Gibson) drops into the coop after escaping a traveling circus. Meanwhile Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) develops a plan to turn her little farm into a massive `chicken pot pie' factory forcing Ginger and Rocky to teach all the others to fly before they become pies. What makes `Chicken Run' so ingenious was how the animators made us want to be apart of the chicken world. We fall head over heals involved with these chickens and their daily lives. Coupled with that involvement, `Chicken Run' also cleverly delivers us into a `prison breakout' movie filled with humor, and excitement. `Chicken Run' is a pure delight. For many people this will be their first experimentation with a full length animated feature involving clay. The clay for me helps reflect the tones and dimensions of the characters. In some ways I think it aids a lot in the audience's involvement in the chicken world. Placing aside the claymation and those magnificent machines, `Chicken Run' also brings back a lot of classic Hollywood moments in the films setting. There are scenes which remind us a lot of the classic World War 2 prison movies. Films like the `Great Escape', `Stalag 17' and even the misadventures of `Hogan's Heroes'. What I liked about those film references here is that they weren't here to poke fun at the films but to play homage. The references also aid the audience in diving deeper into the film and its delight. If you remember `Wallace and Gromit' then you may recall all their huge machines which helped enchant their everyday lives. From the rocket-ship to the sheep shearing machine, `Chicken Run' has these kinds of machines which have always amazed me in their transformation and assembly. How do they dream up these wondrous machines? (4.5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer. (Opens June 23rd)"

","Rarely does a children's movie slice through moral ambiguity to empower our young ones with real values. Standing up for what is right takes courage. Failure is wholly acceptable, giving up is not. Caring for one another shows character. The fight for freedom is an honourable and worthy pursuit. All this and more makes Chicken Run, an 84-minute kiddies chronicle of comedic shenanigans, a modern classic.<br/><br/>Ginger is a chicken who is not happy with the established order of things. After a succession of failed attempts to better her own - and those of her friends - lot in life, the fortuitous arrival of Rocky the rooster may provide the solution they have desperately been seeking. But the evil Mrs. Tweedy has plans of her own. Beyond the profitless subsistence of egg farming lays the boundless financial gain of chicken pie production! Time has run out as the chickens make one last, frantic bid for freedom.<br/><br/>As an amateur clay animator I have some idea of the technical issues faced by the creators of Chicken Run. Believe me when I say it's a time consuming process - even with the instant feedback provided by computers. I started learning the process some 12 years ago with nothing more than an 8mm film camera and a desire to understand the magic. Though technology has improved the production process of claymation' the methods have, more or less, remained the same. Aardman Animations (Wallace and Gromit, Creature Comforts, Rex The Runt, and others) lead the field by applying knowledge, skill, patience and innovation to all their projects. From humble beginnings with Morph from Vision On (a programme specifically for hearing impaired children) they have - slowly - produced an outstanding body of work. Chicken Run is currently the pinnacle of their efforts and deserves its place as cock of the walk (and I almost made it to the end of this review without cracking a pun almost)."

","As a big Wallace and Grommit fan, I eagerly awaited this chick flick.  And the technique is exquisite.  It starts off very well and ends in a burst of excitement.  The only problem is that it may sag a little too much in the middle for young children (or old people like me).  While the running time may be a little long (it would be worth paying full ticket price if it had been only an hour in length), causing it to drag at times, it nevertheless is a remarkable achievement whose pluses will invariably outweigh its piddling minuses.<br/><br/>A word about some of the namby-pamby reviewers.  We coddle our children too much.  We're afraid they'll have nightmares.  We shelter them from the idea that there's pain in the world.  How many people remember the horror of Disney's ""Snow White""?  I was scared to death, seeing it as a kid, yet I'm perfectly normal.  Sure, there's a chicken beheading, but it's necessary to make the threat of the Tweedys clear. Otherwise the obsession with escape doesn't make a lot of sense to the modern liberal mind, where sitting around, being fed by the owners (or government), even without freedom, is the goal.  After all, the hens, for the most part, didn't know they weren't free;  only one dreamer (Ginger) suspected there was more to life than what she'd always known.  The same people who object to even the hint that one of the hens died a violent death probably don't object to exposing their kids to bad language and sexual stuff, blatant or innuendo.  The execution is what makes the movie works, and children of all ages should see it. Besides, it happens early on and they'll get over it.  So get over it."

","Nick Park, the director of the award winning WALLACE & GROMIT shorts has finally released his first major film titled CHICKEN RUN.  And I personally rank Nick Park on the same level of family entertainment as other such entertainers as John Lasseter, Jim Henson, and Walt Disney.  Each of these men take a different form of style to tell a fascinating story in a fantasy world. Though computer animation, to puppets, to animation, to claymation, all of these forms of entertainment will both amaze and wow children of all ages. CHICKEN RUN is to THE GREAT ESCAPE, what A BUG'S LIFE was to SEVEN SAMUARI or MAGNIFICANT SEVEN.  CHICKEN has a group of chickens who live on Tweedy's farm.  The chickens are to produce at least five eggs a day, and if they don't they become supper for the Tweedy's.  The chicken farm is run by the sadistic Mrs. Tweedy (voiced by Miranda Richardson), and her not to bright husband, Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth).  The profits for the egg business are running low so Mrs. Tweedy comes across a offer to make chicken pot pies.  Which spells doom for the chickens on the farm.  Ginger (Julia Sawalha) has been leading the chickens on many various escapes, but they all fail.  Then hope arises in the form of a rooster, Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson).  Rocky just escaped from the circus, and is a feature attraction.  So to cut a deal, Ginger will keep her mouth shut, if Rocky helps teach the chickens on how to fly.      CHICKEN RUN is very similar to the brillance of both TOY STORY movies and BABE.  The animals and animation are cute and funny, while the jokes are very witty and funny.  Such lines as: ""my egg shell was bigger than that place,"" and ""you're a 20 minute egg, aren't you?"" are some of the cleaver dialogue featured in the film.      The voices from the actors are also well done.  Gibson, Sawalha, and Richardson are all good doing the vocal talents for their characters.  And I also enjoyed Imelda Staunton as the not too bright Bunty. And the animation is among Nick Park's best.  It's just as enjoyable and funny as any of the Wallace and Gromit adventures, and what makes the film spectacular is that Park uses different camera angles for the claymation.  I have to give high credit to that originality. <br/><br/>     CHICKEN RUN is among not only the best film of the year, but also one of the best family films of all time.  I just hope that Americans will see the creativty that is coming over from Great Britian with this film.  If you loved the enjoyable TOY STORY films and A BUG'S LIFE, and even if you love Wallace & Gromit, then CHICKEN RUN is one of the few films this year that is worth the price of admission.  And it's a film that is just as enjoyable to see the second time around as it is the first time!  ***** (out of five)"

","Chickens.  <br/><br/>Lots and lots of chickens.  Chickens from England, walking, running, and knitting.  There's something really funny about British claymation characters, something that the creators of `Wallace and Grommit' have known for quite some time.  `Chicken Run', their first full-length animated feature, brings together elements of `The Great Escape', `101 Dalmatians', and even some `Star Trek' to create a hilarious, smart, vegetarian conscious movie.<br/><br/>The crisis: the chickens are prisoners at a farm where unproductive hens are turned into dinner and even the prolific ones are treated like egg-laying slaves.  The farm's evil owner then has a moment of fiendish clarity and realizes that gathering and selling eggs is boring. Making chicken pot pies would be much more profitable and probably a heck of a lot more fun, so she buys a pie machine.  Well, you can't make pot pies without breakin' a few chickens, but since they're so cute--well, as cute as British chickens can be--we don't want them to die!  We want them to run and fly outta there!  Wait--chickens can't fly or can they?<br/><br/>They answer is - no, of course chickens can't fly, sorry to disappoint you.  But they can sure try, and try they do.  This becomes one of the most entertaining parts of the whole film, as most training montages tend to be.  With the help of a flying rooster (voice of Mel Gibson), and the leadership of funky chicken Ginger (the daughter from TV show `Absolutely Fabulous'), the ladies try everything from leaping off rooftops to being flung in giant slingshots, all with hilariously unsuccessful results.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the evil farmer becomes all that much closer to completing her pot pie contraption, and the chickens still don't know how to fly.<br/><br/>Before they can escape they'll have to face the facts and realize that to get out they'll have to use their brains instead of their funny-looking wings.  Each chicken has a special skill, from knitting (the fat, naive chicken) to engineering (the Scottish one with bad vision) that will have to work together to get them out.       <br/><br/>
Boy, the theme sounds corny, but it definitely works in this film.<br/><br/>`Chicken Run' teaches that although we can't fly, we have the right to say `Buwaaauck!' and eat corn off the ground as free fowl, without worry of laying eggs or becoming pot pies.  Besides that, those little faces are enough to keep you entertained and wondering just how much patience someone must have to animate a film like this.<br/><br/>My grade for `Chicken Run': A"

Mel Gibson gives a great performance as Rocky, and the other vocal artists are excellent as well.  Lighting, set decoration and photography are sharp as usual.  Most amazing is the range and subtlety of facial expressions emanating from a few artfully moved eyebrows, eyelids, head shapes, etc.  (It's even more amazing since they don't actually have eyebrows, etc.)  This together with the vocal direction gives the characters real life and feeling.<br/><br/>This is great entertainment for all ages, well suited for family viewing.

","I love Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit shorts, so I couldn't wait to see Chicken Run.  Unfortunately, animated movies are considered kids' fare, so Chicken Run is forced to focus on the kids more than the adults (although one has to wonder why a comment about ""over-sexed"" Americans made its way into the script), as opposed to the sly silliness and unpredictability of Park's W&G stories.  That's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie, but it seems like Park betrayed his fans to make a successful ""family film.""<br/><br/>Strangely enough, some moments--some KEY moments--seem destined to fly over kids' heads.  For example, when the revelation is made about Rocky's flying ability, what has been obvious to most viewers for some time is finally made know to the rest.  But the explanation consists of a brief glimpse at a poster and a semi-scientific quip about thrust.  So if we're going to get a vague explanation for such an obvious secret, why make it a secret at all? If this is meant to build suspense, it should not have been so predictable. (It works in that it makes kids feel smart when they can say they figured it out before they were told, but that just demonstrates how adults are ignored in this movie.)<br/><br/>Overall though, the movie has enough humor and just plain fun to make it enjoyable.

Well, it looks like a concentration camp in the Auschwitz style. Many identical small houses, huge wire fences, and it's dark, very dark. But then you see... Well, a chicken trying to escape from the place... but she fails. These failed tries of escaping are shown several times in the hilarious first minutes of CHICKEN RUN, the new stop-motion animation by Peter Lord and Nick Park, the creators of the awarded and worldwide famous cartoons of WALLACE & GROMIT. The unlucky chicken who always ends up in the solitaire (I mean, garbage) is Ginger. And the concentration camp is an English farm in the '50s, owned by Mrs. Tweedy, a mean and ambitious women who mistreats her husband and only thinks about making money with the chicken. Ginger wants to escape at all costs, but there's no way... till heaven sends her the solution: Rocky, a flying rooster from the US who will teach them how to fly. Of course things won't be all right, especially after Mrs. Tweedy buys a new machine for making chicken pies.<br/><br/>Wonderfully written, CHICKEN RUN's greatest virtue is its clever concept. It borrows many elements from real life and action flicks in general and puts it into the chickens' day-by-day life. It works in many levels as a family movie (children are loving it!) but also pleases teenagers and adults- we can have fun with the references to prison/escape and action movies in general. But don't make confusion- this isn't only a satire and the references aren't so obvious as in Mel Brooks' and Leslie Nielsen's parodies. The links are mostly slight, as the farm/concentration camp/repressed chicken/prisoner link I've already mentioned and, for example, a small spoof of the AIR FORCE ONE scene, in which Harrison Ford flies outside a helicopter holding a wire or something close to that.<br/><br/>The stop-motion technic deserves much credit. The WALLACE & GROMIT cartoons were short-feature films, while CHICKEN RUN is an 80 minutes long-feature film. It's not suffice to say that the work was hard- each tiny movement was filmed separately, and then edited- but it was worthy. It's one of those things that you can only see on the big screen of a theater.<br/><br/>The characters are all well defined: Ginger and Rocky are the heroes, Mrs. Tweedy is the villain and Mr. Tweedy is her poor husband, convinced by her that he has hallucinations with the chickens. Rocky has the most famous of the voices: Hollywood star Mel Gibson. Ginger is dubbed by Julia Sawalha and Mrs. Tweedy has the voice of Miranda Richardson.<br/><br/>There are plenty of memorable characters (the two mice, the dumb chicken, the RAF rooster) and delightful scenes (Ginger and Rocky inside the pie machine, the climax) in CHICKEN RUN, that will make this a small classic of animation. Even if we know what is going to happen in the end, we have great fun during the whole film. This colorful story about quest for freedom and liberty is for sure one of the best, funniest, most intelligent and most invigorating animation movies to be released in the past years."

","Being a fan of Wallace and Grommit, I saw Chicken Run at a sneak preview showing.  I had high hopes for Chicken Run to live up to the quality and entertainment value of Wallace and Grommit.  I was a little disappointed.<br/><br/>The plot centers around a group of chickens trying to escape from a farm and live free away from the threat of being slaughtered by the Farmer's wife. It seems like a good premise for a movie--and it was entertaining.  If you're expecting something as delightful as Wallace and Grommit you will be a little disappointed, for a few reasons.<br/><br/>The plotting seems a little worn in the middle sections of the movie in which the chickens are stiiiill trying to figure out how to escape after spending an hour of the movie on the problem already.  At the showing I went to, I actually heard someone around me snoring as they nodded off to sleep during the middle of the movie.  Most of the children in the audience also seemed bored and restless by the middle.  I think the makers were trying to stretch a not-quite-feature-length script into a feature length script and didn't know quite how to write a longer-form story.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the last 10 minutes of the movie picked up and ended in energetic, entertaining and clever Wallace and Grommit style.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is still a fun movie to watch--just don't expect the same standard as Wallace and Grommit where there are many clever details, turns and twists to keep you interested the whole way through.<br/><br/>It also misses some of the charm of the incredibly strong charactarization and detail work(such as the Penguin) from Wallace and Grommit.  The characters are fairly cookie-cutter children's movie, cliche, Disney-like characters.  You don't get the unexpected and entertaining that Nick Park has delivered in the past.<br/><br/>If you don't even know who Wallace and Grommit are, go see Chicken Run since it's at least as good as most recent Disney cartoon movies.<br/><br/>If you're a Wallace and Grommit fan, you'll probably want to see it also, just don't expect quite as high a standard as Nick Park's previous work has lead you to expect.<br/><br/>I give it a 7 out of 10--which is a moderately good review for me since I don't generally give most movies much over a 6 unless I like them reasonably well."

","While many movies like ""The Perfect Storm"" floundered as solid entertainment vehicles, ""Chicken Run"" provided safe harbor as a candid, non-assuming, original, and often hilarious film hatched out of Aardman Studios.  Using elements from POW movies like ""The Great Escape"" and ""Stalag 17"", with Hitchcockian accents thrown here and there, this movie focuses on a group of chickens seeking escape before their goose is cooked (or to be more accurate, turned into a pie).  The excruciatingly-worked animation rivals the magic spun by computer-generated images, with many keen details worked into the sets and nuances of each character's expression.  There's humor, suspense, love, and triumph for movie-goers of every age, and I'm plucked dry to think of any comparable work that offers so much for admission.<br/><br/>Performances are excellently matched from voice to animated character: Mel Gibson gives a tongue-in-beak performance as Rocky, the American rooster , and Miranda Richardson is diabolically charming as the ill-spirited Mrs. Tweedy.  Kudos also to Julia Sawalha as Ginger, the leader of the chicken squad, and Benjamin Whitrow as Fowler, the stodgy RAF rooster who presides - with questionable authority - over the chicken farm.<br/><br/>An incredibly fun, inventive, and charming movie from start to finish."

","I must admit, my heart sank for a few seconds when Rocky opened his mouth and punctured the North English atmosphere with his American accent.  Was it true, after all?  Had Aardman traded its soul for an American audience?<br/><br/>No, it hadn't.  The film got better, not worse, after Rocky's entrance (neither because nor in spite of him, I think); it became more, not less, true to itself.  It's probably the best Aardman work so far; better even than ""A Close Shave"", which it somewhat resembles - it's better because it's longer and more ambitious, yet scarcely puts a foot wrong.  The understated, lovably daft characters are similar to those of the Wallace-and-Gromit world, but they're more than mere copies.  The rat duo was an inspired creation; and Ginger is an endearing chicken indeed.<br/><br/>Every aspect of the art direction is excellent.  If you've made allowances for the story's perfect construction, and the wit, and you still think the film is more exhilarating than it ought to be, you've probably forgotten the cumulative effect of such flawless visual world-spinning.  Why does anyone bother making computer-animated films, when this kind of thing is possible? Taken together, ""Chicken Run"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" - very different in style - form a decisive refutation of computer animation.  The world of ""Toy Story"", to which the computer style is ideally suited, doesn't have half the richness or solidity of ""Chicken Run"" or ""Nightmare""; and one can't help thinking how much better ""A Bug's Life"" would have been if it had been made in stop-motion.  -It couldn't have been as good as this, though."

Babs is voiced by Jane Horicks from ""Little Voice."" She is so brainless and dumb, that she is hilarious. She knits constantly. The funny thing is that she makes jokes for adults. Of course, it has the slap stick humor for the kids, but mostly adults jokes as I have said before. <br/><br/>""Chicken Run"" was the best reviewed movie of 2000 and I can agree with every critic who loved the movie.

Not that I do not like Disney's films, on the contrary I love most of them, but I like a bit variation too man. I mean Dreamworks' Antz was much better than Disney's A Bug's Life, whereas Buena Vista's (sort of Disney's) Armageddon was much better than Dreamworks' Deep Impact.

"Buddy-51","Null","0","0","16 December 2000"," fun animated tale
","Though not on a level with `Toy Story 2,' DreamWorks' animated hit `Chicken Run' provides enough originality of concept and expertise of execution to score as fun, high-spirited entertainment for the whole family.  Borrowing heavily from the 1963 classic `The Great Escape,' `Chicken Run' cleverly envisions a British poultry farm as a barbed-wired camp in which a group of animated hens and one retired RAF rooster are trapped in a life of hopeless, egg-producing servitude.  When the owners of the farm decide to up their profits by converting their operation to a chicken pie manufacturing plant, Ginger, the feisty, levelheaded hen who harbors visions of a glorious life beyond the confines of this hellish prison, decides it is time for the ladies to band together and find a way to escape once and for all. Meanwhile, into their lives drops Rocky the Flying Rooster, a wisecracking American circus performer whose head is easily turned by the attention such a singular stud naturally receives from a coop full of love-starved females. Together, these unlikely heroes and heroines plan and scheme their big break, encountering various setbacks and thwarting multitudinous dangers along the way.<br/><br/>As a piece of animation, `Chicken Run' is truly outstanding.  Opting for traditional animated puppetry rather than drawn cel animation or even computer-generated graphics, the creators of `Wallace and Gromit' (Peter Lord and Nick Park) do a remarkable job of creating an assortment of characters whose movements are fluid and whose appearance borders on the surrealistic.  In short, these are not `realistic' looking chickens - all the better to enhance the otherworldly quality of the film's setting.  The carefully crafted sets and backgrounds represent a similar triumph in the areas of attention to detail and establishment of mood.  The movie is, quite simply, a joy to look at from beginning to end, and it is gratifying to know that filmmakers can buck the recent trend towards full scale computer animation and still produce a film that looks this impressive.<br/><br/>Just as important, Karey Kirkpatrick has provided a script filled with clever one-liners, finding just the right balance of acerbic wit and heartwarming sentiment.  In addition, every single voice, including Mel Gibson's as Rocky, sounds perfectly right in the context of the character assigned to it.  <br/><br/>If there is a bit of a flaw in `Chicken Run,' it probably lies in the fact that the story itself is not quite as fresh or original as the technological accoutrements used to put it across.  In terms of sophistication, the tale itself sometimes seems to be lagging behind the eye-popping visuals and the ear-tickling dialogue.  Still, this is a minor quibble about a film that works so well on so many levels.  `Chicken Run' may not be one of the great works of animation, but it certainly stands as one of the best such films of recent times."

","Chicken Run: The poultry population of Tweedy's farm has grown tired of being slaves to production and is determined to escape.  Unfortunately every attempt has either failed or been foiled.  They're given renewed hope with the arrival of Rocky, a swaggering American rooster who agrees to teach them how to fly in exchange for shelter.<br/><br/>In a climate where computer animation has become the standard, it is refreshing to see what can be done with simple clay figures.  Produced by the team that created the Oscar winning ""Wallace and Gromit"" series, Chicken Run uses stop motion photography, a craft generally relegated to realm of animation festivals.  This is the first time this technique has been used in a full feature big budget movie and I was amazed at the versatility of the medium: the range of expressions and actions is amazing.  I can only imagine how much effort it took to create this picture but I'm glad they did.<br/><br/>It is very difficult to try to categorize this movie as it s so different from the standard Hollywood fare.  For example, the marketing campaign has been brilliant - rather than simply showing trailers with snippets of the movie, they have crafted hilarious parodies of both MI:2 (people were screaming in delight when this trailer was shown before MI:2) and Gladiator. And unlike so many instances where the trailers are better than the movie, Chicken Run delivers.<br/><br/>The story, which pays homage to such classic films as ""The Great Escape"", ""Stalag 17"" and ""Star Trek"", is well written, engaging and has elements that will appeal to both young and old alike.  The characters have more depth than many I've seen in live action films: whether you're drawn to Rocky, the cocky upstart with a secret, Ginger, the driven saviour of the group who yearns for freedom, or the crotchety old Colonel, you will find someone you can relate to.   The humor runs the gamut from subtle, to the absurd and it comes fast and furious  - the audience rarely stopped laughing.   Finally, the pacing is excellent - there are few lulls in the action and they don't rely on unnecessary filler to bridge the scenes.<br/><br/>I don't know that this movie will be a blockbuster (read $200 million) but it is already on my top ten list for this year, and I think it will prove to be the ""Iron Giant"" for 2000.

Then one night, Rocky Rhodes, a flying rooster, ends up hiding in a chicken coop and promising to teach them how to fly out of the farm.<br/><br/>While the entire thing may sound like a film driven purely at kids, it's surprisingly charming and intelligent, using its English setting to its advantage, creating a group of disarmingly funny and cute, memorable characters that adults can also enjoy.  The voiceovers are off-beat and often hilarious, except for Mel Gibson, whose harsh, gratingly annoying voice seems totally out-of-place as the asinine American rooster.  Perhaps if a different actor would have been used, the character would see much more likeable.<br/><br/>The claymation in the film is flawless, and the enlarged eyes and overall pudgy look of the hens is very adorable, and a thrilling ride inspired by Indiana Jones through a chicken pot pie machine.

Chicken Run impressed me just as much as W&G did!<br/><br/>Ginger (Julia Sawalha) is the leader of a gang of chickens who are trying to break out of a Yorkshire chicken farm set in the 1950's. As the group of chicks continuously try to break out of their hatching-hell, more chickens are been taken into a machine to be made into chicken pies. Ginger and her gang are about to give up, but then an inspiring and decidedly sexy chicken named Rocky comes along and announces that he is able to fly.

The story is basically about a bunch of Chickens, doomed to death until Rocky the flying Rooster (voiced by Mel Gibson) flies into the yard one day hiding from his Circus prison.

After several failed escapes, Ginger spots a rooster flying overhead, and it lands in their coop. His name is Rocky, a real 'Rhode Island red' as he puts it.  The site of Rocky in England has all the other chickens excited, they never have had anyone from America before in their coop.  But Ginger sees Rocky as the chickens ticket to freedom.  Ginger thinks they can escape by getting Rocky to teach everyone to fly (of course he can't, he's just an awol rooster escaping from the circus who is routinely shot out of a cannon).  But time is short, and the farmers wife has plans for a new machine where you insert chickens in one end, and out the other end comes out instant chicken pies!!<br/><br/>This movie is hilarious, touching and absolutely perfect.  The film contains, Mac a scottish inventor, 2 vicious guard dogs, a clueless chicken named Bab, 2 shady mice (one sneaky the other dumb) who steal stuff and provide all the tools for the escape attempts from the farmers house, and Fowler an old English rooster who dis-trusts the 'American' as a Yank who knows nothing about discipline.  Fowler is probably the best character and my favourite in the film who waxes poeticaly about his days in the RAF, and is literaly the English version of Sam the Eagle on the Muppet Show. 'Always late to the war you Americans' he keeps saying.  This movie is also filled with lots of British and American bashing which is very funny, and it contains lots of parodies of other films such as 'Stalag 17', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', and 'Star Trek'.<br/><br/>A perfect film for kids, and adults will love it.  Also the animation is INCREDIBLE.  It seems like this claymation movie could have taken 5+ years just to make!!.  This is absolutely one of the best films of the year.. and the only one so far that I have seen to come out this year to receive this rating..<br/><br/>Rating 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>If you did not like this film there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with you!"

","Chicken Run is, without question, the best movie of the summer. Nick Park and Peter Lord have proven to the world at large that a Claymation film can run longer than a short subject and still be a success. This film's evocation of the great prisoner of war movies (The Great Escape, Stalag 17) is at once stunning and hilarious. The amount of detail given in paying homage to these films gives Chicken Run its edge and its very British tone. I attended the film with my 3 year old son, who laughed hysterically in all the right places and has now officially proclaimed Chicken Run his favourite film. I was rolling in the aisles myself. Like The Iron Giant, this film disproves the Disney ethos that an animated film needs to be a musical to be a success; the only difference is that Chicken Run has the box office to show for it. Great voice-over work from all involved, an amazing amount of detail everywhere (this film screams out for repeat viewings) , and a solid script combine to create one of the most pleasurable filmgoing experiences I have ever had.

This is a treat to find combined with Nick Park's trademark inventive direction and his mentor Peter Lord's production design.

","Chicken Run, from the Wallace and Gromit guys, it must be said is an entertaining comedy, although as with the Wallace and Gromit movies, it lacks any depth or different approaches. As well as that the standard 50's style machinery, good vs evil (main character being good) and love interest as a side-story is all a little predictable and unimaginative. The TV series 'The Simpsons' is a prime example of excellent imagination and clever scripting and one-liners, which in my opinion is clearly missing from a film such as C.R in order to take it up the pecking order (pun intended).<br/><br/>On the positive side found much of escape attempts, animation and the nods to great films of the past. Notably 'The Great Escape' (underground tunnel with sliders + chicken bounces ball against side of small solidartry confinement eg Steve McQueen). Also the over used Indiana Jones, slide under a closing door from roof to floor and dropping there hat, to then reach back inside to get it. Although I thought the biggest take-off appeared to miss most critics, that of Flight of the Phoenix, eg deciding to build a plane with the guidance of what they think is an expert, but they misunderstood him.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a pretty standard predictable comedy, although still worth watching, although its a far reach from some of the great films surrounding it in the IMDB 250 list."

","Eyes, popularly, are considered windows to the soul. But in the anatomy book of genius-tinged animator Nick Park and his cohorts at Aardman, teeth really tell the story. Beginning with the Academy Award-winning 1989 short ""Creature Comforts"" and through his epic Wallace and Gromit mini-adventures, Park has filled the mouths of his saunchly English, valiantly middle-class players (clay animated penguins and sheep as well as ladies and gents) with soulful choppers: In good times and bad, the set of an Aardman jaw speaks volumes as said penguin, sheep, dog, woman or man adapts with tea-and-toast-loving civility to unpredictable (and usually daunting) fate.<br/><br/>In their first full-length feature, the care Park and co-director Peter Lord lavish on the dental work of poultry (who it can now be proven, do have lips) pays off.<br/><br/>""Chicken Run"" is a delightful, perceptive, funny, detail-barbed wire, which looks as gloomy as POW barracks; indeed, the command-center hut in which the fearless Ginger plots her flock's great escape bears the same number as that of ""Stalag 17.""<br/><br/>Just when Ginger has run out of idea - she gets a little help from the farm's more timid clucker's including Pollyanna-daft Babs, worrying Mac, and overbearing Bunty - a possible savior falls of the sky sky, like a Yank on a parachute mission. According to the circus poster that floats down with him Rocky is ""The Flying Rooster."" Surely he can teach his admiring audience of grounded ladies to do the same?<br/><br/>""Chicken Run"" is a can-do comedy built of small, confident gestures. It's a piece with other Aardman projects, not a breakthrough in form or content. But the cosy, period-piece story is sharpened by Karey Kirkpatrick's bright script. The wit is droll, heightened by the whistle-through-danger musical score. The throw-away references to other movies, plays and transatlantic cultural attitudes are a tickle. And the technique is remarkably fluid as ever. (One cackle: an excellent clay-animation spit take.)<br/><br/>The vocal talents are uniformly superior, from Mel Gibson playing the vain celebrity, to Miranda Richardson as the classically pinched villainess, Mrs. Tweedy. This excellence is the work of human actors who never feel the need to outshine their characters. It's also the work of Nick Park and his team, Englishmen who in the defiance of their national image, pay careful attention to the teeth of the matter."

For the children, there are the talking chickens and rats, and plenty of slapstick comedy and action sequences to keep them glued to their seats (this I know for certain, as I took my 4-year-old nephew Evan and eight-year-old niece Lauren, and even my normally-squirming nephew sat mesmerized during the final escape sequence.)  Even the one bit likely to scare small children (one of the chickens is taken to the chopping block) takes place mostly off-camera, and neither my niece nor my nephew seemed bothered by it.<br/><br/>If you're not familiar with Nick Park's other work, see this movie and then go find his Wallace and Gromit animations.

","Aardman had previously managed a stupendous feat in creating characters an audience would care about, just from little pieces of clay. Now, following on from the success of Wallace and Gromit they have done it again with a whole new, also inanimate, cast, which is pretty impressive. Aardman's triumph is in the sheer appeal of the chicken 'people' with their individual foibles and interactions. Okay, some of the jokes may be a bit clunky, the plot is fairly predictable and there is a little too much gazing at the stars, but they have conjured expressive and sympathetic characters that absorb the attention - unlike many current Hollywood liveaction pics. Added to this, the three great action set pieces are breathtaking and hilarious - and replacing Steve McQueen with a Yorkshire chicken must be an act of mad genius. Well done Aardman.

Until one day an American rooster enters camp, causing hearts falling in love, American-British bilateral friction and a new drive to new ways to escape.

It is nice to see more variety from Disney and Dreamworks as animation seems to be booming once again.  The fact that they had to film this movie one frame at a time while moving clay objects amazes me.  I can almost forgive some of the other problems with this movie. The problems center around the screenplay, by Karey Kirkpatrick, which uses too many subtle references to movies that kids would not recognize.  The Great Escape and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are not films that six years old children will be familiar with.  I personally enjoyed the allusions, but I did not think they were necessary. The writing also lacks the wit of the Toy Story movies or the charm of Babe, which was an obvious inspiration to the filmmakers.  The jokes were much too British for its target audience.  I laughed occasionally, but there were times where the filmmakers were trying for laughs and not getting them. I hope the next claymation production takes as much time with its writing as it did with its amazing animation.

What pre-teen is going to GET these references?  How many have even seen these classics?  Sure - the adults get it, and perhaps thats why they are in the movie.  But it goes right over the head of kids.  And as for humor - sure, there are some funny bits.

"bat-5","9","0","0","9 July 2000"," Utterly charming.
","Chicken Run is probably the most original, most refreshing and delightful movies this season. Nick Park, the genius behind Wallace & Gromit, tells the story of a group of hens who are bound and determined to escape from Tweedy's Farm.  Led by the ever resourseful, and persevering Ginger, the hens try tunneling, making runs for the gate and just about everything else you could imagine.  When all hope is lost, along comes Rocky Rhodes, who might just be the answer to their prayers.  The film benefits from being animated with clay.  If it was done with traditional animation or computers, the feel of the film would be off.  The chickens with their large behinds and teeth look less like chickens, and more like a strange sort of doppleganger to the actors that give them voices.  A very British sensibility runs through the film.  From Ginger's never give up attitude, to Col. Fowler's tirades about doing things in the R.A.F.  and his feelings towards Rocky's involvement.  As he says about ""Yanks"", ""Always late for a war, over sexed and over here.""  Chicken Run is a wonderful film for all ages.  The older kids (namely adults) will have fun with the jokes and references to other films, while the younger kids will enjoy the animation and the rousing story.  Very witty, very charming and utterly irresistable."

OK, now that I've recovered from my little attack of ""shalitis"" ,( An obsessive compulsive ""punning disorder""which often afflicts would-be ""clever critics"" )I will say that I have nothing bad to say about this film.

","The main surprise for me was just how cleverly-done all the jokes were. Many American producers have really lost any appreciation of subtlety that they ever had - no matter whether it's a kids' movie or an ""adult"" comedy, they never give the audience any credit to intelligence.<br/><br/>Chicken Run's main strength is that they don't feel that they always have to use obvious jokes or sight gags most of the time to make you laugh; they're not even afraid to put in references that few people below their teens will be able to pick up on.  Just wait until you catch at least one or two nods towards one of the more well-known Mel Gibson movies of the past few years. :)<br/><br/>Some of the characterizations are fairly expected (the evil Mrs. Tweedy, for example), but they don't really go over the top and certainly help liven things up.  Most everyone will have a favourite character by the time the credits begin to roll.<br/><br/>One last thing to touch on is Chicken Run's unyielding ""Britishness."" Despite attracting American interest, it's clear that Aardman wasn't pushed into producing something contrary to their vision.  Rocky may be a major character, but that doesn't save him from being torn down as the stereotypical American hotshot.  The other chickens are all wonderfully British; they're not afraid to use different accents and mannerisms, and so in addition to the laughs you get a distinct charm that you'd never get outside of a British production.<br/><br/>All in all quite a surprise - go see this if you're looking for something well outside of the usual summer blockbuster spectrum.  This is especially true if you just have to catch a Mel Gibson movie this summer; Chicken Run is on the whole much less pretentious than The Patriot (although that's not due to Gibson) and more universally appealing."

Plus, it had traces of ""Animal Farm"" scattered throughout the story and, indeed, in the final frames, there are characters who make mention of starting a ""chicken farm"".

There are some great British humour like ""I don't want to be in a pie- I don't like gravy!"" The characters like the two mice are genuinely memorable, and Mrs Tweedy is really evil, especially when voiced by the talented Miranda Richardson. (who they wasted in the animated version of King and I)The voice talents are wonderful- I know people had problems with Mel Gibson as Rocky, but he was not that bad at all. Julia Sawalha, Jane Horrocks, Phil Daniels, Tony Haygarth et al, enthusiastically bring their characters to life, with an irreverent and touching story, that cleverly sends up classics such as The Great Escape. The incidental music was lovely to hear, very dynamic. There are some truly priceless scenes, like Rocky teaching the chickens to fly, the scene with Ginger and Rocky in the pie-making machine and the scene where the chickens are dancing to the song that you hear in the end-credits. I don't have a favourite character as such, but I loved Fowler. All in all, a funny movie, and yet another triumph from Nick Park, that I have started to appreciate a lot more. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

"DocMoc","7","1","2","20 August 2009"," A good film for the family...but not Oscar-winning like Happy Feet
","Slightly based on the 1963 film The Great Escape comes the egg of that chicken and the child appropriation, Chicken Run , starring Julia Sawalha and Mel Gibson as the two main characters. The movie is not a ""chick flick"", but the directors and writers Peter Lord and Nick Park make it ""eggcellent"".<br/><br/>The claymation/stop-motion movie is set in Britain in the 1950's and is about a group of chickens in a coop who are being raised and will be killed when they stop laying their eggs. However, the main chicken, Ginger (Julia Sawalha) leads the optimism of the group and believes they can escape. The chooks have attempted to escape their pen a multiple of times, but have always failed. But then Rocky (Mel Gibson), a rooster who accidentally flies into their pen, is forced to help all the chickens to escape the pen because he can fly. It turns out he is actually escaping himself from the circus.<br/><br/>The voice-over performances of the chickens were average. They were not the best, I believe. However I think that's not really the point of a movie like this. Films like Wallace & Gromit, Harvie Krumpet and the famous Russian short, Peter and the Wolf, are not supposed to demonstrate the voice-over talents of the actors, but more importantly, they are meant to show off the clay art and the skillful editing (Robert Francis, Tamsin Parry, Mark Solomon).<br/><br/>The main thing about this movie that made me ""crack up"" like an egg was Craig Atkinson's modelling of the chickens. All the way through the movie, I could not help but laugh at the chooks' mouths. They are so funny and absolutely ridiculous and to hear a funny female British accent with words like ""Is she going' on a holiday?"", just make it a lot more hilarious. The cinematography is great, especially the lighting (in my opinion) and so I say ""Well done!"" to Andy MacCormack and Paul Smith.<br/><br/>I think it's clever that a movie that's a true story revolving around a concentration camp in the Second World War was transformed into a children's' movie about...well...chickens!! Originally, in The Great Escape, the Jews were being controlled by Nazis and in Chicken Run, the chickens are being controlled and killed by a nasty pommy couple. Which is worse, we might ask! I think if you want a great family animation film with a great story, entertaining animation and a good moral, then definitely watch Chicken Run.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is decent. The story was well adapted, the modelling and animation was funny and very effective. I thought the style was hilarious (especially the mouths). The actors were not especially good, but the female British accents were enjoyable to watch. However, my complaint is clearly contradicted by the film's Golden Globe nomination for best animation/musical.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would say that this movie should be watched by everyone who wants a good laugh."

","While this is not the best product Aardman Pictures has ever made, even a film that comes very close to the fun and creativity of the Wallace & Gromit films is a delight.<br/><br/>The film stars all new characters and is quite a departure for the animators, as this is a full-length film, not a short. But, you'd never know that these film makers hadn't made such a picture before, as the product is exceptional from start to finish.<br/><br/>It all takes place on a bizarre chicken farm. That's because the sets and action in the film more approximates the film THE GREAT ESCAPE than anything else--and this is deliberate. On this odd chicken farm, there are some determined chickens--determined to escape because some of them realize what their fate will be if they stay. All doubts about this are removed when Mr. & Mrs. Tweety invest in a horrid chicken pie producing machine. You just drop in a chicken, and out drops pies!! Unfortunately, the chickens have no idea how to escape. Aside from a slightly loony old male chicken who acts like a WWII vet, the rest of the chickens are all layers and have no idea what the real world outside is like. Then, out of the blue, a performing chicken (more precisely, one who is shot out of a cannon) arrives in the farm and the ladies all know that he will lead them to safety. If only they knew that he hasn't the foggiest idea how to help.<br/><br/>The film features the usual plastic figures that are pose-able, along with very detailed and realistic miniature sets. It's actually quite amazing how far these characters are from the original clay Wallace & Gromit figures. They don't look quite as crude and they seem to have tons of personality--so much so that you soon forget that you are rooting on a whole bunch of dolls! The effect is further enhanced by excellent writing throughout--with a healthy dose of humor for the parents.<br/><br/>Overall, a wonderful picture...though my favorite was their next feature, WALLACE & GROMIT AND THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT. Great stuff."

This changes when an American rooster flies into the compound and Ginger realises that he can teach them to fly out of the farm.<br/><br/>From the makers of Wallace and Gromit came this first feature which I was greatly looking forward to.  W&G manage to be imaginative and hilarious without resorting to smutty humour to please the adults, they really did transcend ages.  Chicken run takes the same approach but expands to 80 minutes or so.  The plot is very clever  imagine The Great Escape set on a poultry farm and you've got it.  The film isn't afraid to show the dark side of this life and it is quite obvious considering it's a kids film.  It's moves nicely along with the energy covering the plot sagging a bit in the middle, however in terms of humour it is a little of a let down.<br/><br/>The jokes are mostly very good, whether it be funny movie references or the chickens falling around or being silly.  However at 80 minutes the stretch marks do so and it isn't as consistent as I'd hoped it would be.  That's not to say it's not funny (it is!) but minute for minute it doesn't match other Ardman films.  The movie references are all good  from the Colditz Story, The Great Escape, Indiana Jones and a wonderful Braveheart joke that heralds Rocky's arrival.<br/><br/>The cast are good and really bring life to the animals.  Sawalha is well cast as Ginger and Horrocks brings a lot of laughs as Babs.  Gibson is pretty good as Rocky and sends himself up well despite wandering off in the middle for a bit.  Daniels and Spall are good rats but I felt their jokes were weak and more could have been done with their characters.  Richardson and Haygarth both hold well as the Tweedy's.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't as hilarious as I'd hoped but it was still very funny indeed.

It's hardly poultry in motion when Rocky attempts to teach Ginger and her fine feathered friends to fly but, with teamwork, determination and a little bit o' cluck, the fearless flock plots one last daring attempt in a spectacular bid for freedom!<br/><br/>Where do you start with this wonderful movie. Undoubtedly the story is fantastic. The people who thought up the wonderful script for Chicken Run deserve a round of applause, because it was great. A story about a coop of chickens trying to escape from an evil chicken farm was superb. In addition some of the quotes that were said throughout  the film were hilarious, and make me laugh every time I watch it . <br/><br/>This leads me to the great performances by the voiceovers in Chicken Run. My favourite character would have to be Rocky the Rhode Island Red' Rooster, and his voice was supplied by Hollywood superstar Mel Gibson. He did such a great job as Rocky, and made me laugh many times. I recently saw Gibson in What women want, and no wonder they used his voice in this film, because Rocky and Gibson have the similar personality and traits. Rocky's entrance cry of Freedommm'  is unforgettable. Yet other character such as chickens Ginger (Julia Sawalia), Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow),  Babs (Jane Horrocks), Mac (Lynn Ferguson), The rats Nick (Timothy Spall) and Fetcher (Phil Daniels) and the Tweedy's (Miranda Richardson and Tony Haygarth) were all done to perfection. In fact, if Rocky was not in the film, then the Rats would be my favourites, with some of the silly things they say and do. Watch the credits right through, because there is an hilarious piece of dialogue between the two of them, which had me in stitches. <br/><br/>Yet this movies also deals with some very complex ideologies. Liberals would absolutely love this film for the references to freedom, the individual and being able to do whatever a person wants, or in this case what a chicken wants. The strongest characters with these traits would have to be Rocky and Ginger. Yet Conservatism also appears heavily in Chicken Run. The character of Fowler is very much stuck in his conservative ways, always referring to how it was done in his RAF days, his medals and traditional stories. Moreover, Mr Tweedy states to Mrs Tweedy that they can not give up egg farming, because of his previous generations doing the same tradition. However, socialism also appears in this movie. Socialists believe that people should live in a classless society, with everyone working together. Chicken Run also put this into practices, when the coop attempts the big escape, by working as a team. <br/><br/>The directors of Chicken Run, Nick Park and Peter Lord did a great job on Chicken Run, as did all the people behind the scenes. The people who made all the characters for this film did a wonderful job. Making this plasticine, into a real life character amazed me. In addition, learning that that 40 people worked individually on 2.5 seconds of frame work per day for two years, makes this film all the more of an achievement. Hopefully Lord and Park can make more movies like this one, because they did this one to perfection. <br/><br/>The soundtrack in this film was also very impressive. The musical tunes made the right impression at the right time, along with some great songs as well. Songs such as  Flip Flop and Fly (Ellis Hall) and The Wanderer (Dion) fitted in nicely. The use of the song Flip Flop and Fly' was excellent.<br/><br/>So overall, Chicken Run can only be given praise. All the hard work done to bring to the movie to the big screen is enough in my book. Yet the story, the humour and the great voiceovers are all superb. I have read some comments about Chicken Run, saying that it is just for kids, I disagree whole heartedly.This is the sort of animation film that anyone can enjoy. Try not to be too critical of Chicken Run, instead enjoy the experience, because if you can not enjoy this film then you have no sense of humour in my view. People with DVD access, take a look at one impressive package.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10 or 5 Eggs (it was eggcelent!)"

","""Chicken Run"" represents the height of stop-motion animation. It's amazing stuff, and considering the amount of labor that goes into making stop-motion features, I stand in awe. And ""Chicken Run"" is not just for kids and geeks. Adults as well as kids will enjoy the story, a suspenseful account of the repeated attempts by a barnyard of chickens to escape their coops before they are processed into chicken pies. They're led by a plucky young chicken, and aided by a rooster on the lam from the circus. Not deep, but the drama as well as the humor is skillfully maintained throughout. Disney would approve. For a family-oriented Saturday night rental ""Chicken Run"" hits the mark."

","I was really surprised by Chicken Run. I was expecting some dumb kids movie that tried in vain to be as good as other animated classics like Toy Story, but this was a really good film. The story involves a bunch of heavily accented chickens who are trying desperately to learn how to fly so that they can escape the chicken farm where they live, and therefore escape being butchered and made into chicken pot pies. <br/><br/>One of the best things about this movie is the great laughs that it delivers, particularly from the dialogue as this diverse group of chickens communicates with each other about their predicament (`Chickens go in, pies come out!' `Oooohh!! What kind a pies?'). Mel Gibson is great as the voice of Rocky the Rooster, who inadvertently landed himself in the pen with the other desperate chickens, therefore accidentally convincing them that he can fly. <br/><br/>(spoilers) Rocky and the rest of the chickens work desperately to escape the evil Mrs. Tweedy and her pie-making machine, as well as Rocky's dishonesty with the other chickens, particularly Ginger, with whom he develops a heartwarming romance. The chickens' eventual escape is ridiculously unrealistic, but it doesn't matter, because it doesn't have to be realistic. The main characters of the film are talking chickens, I think that a flying machine built and flown by chickens is not going too far, given the type of film that this is. The makers of Wallace and Gromit have come up with another winner, and it's good for the whole family."

","Being huge fans of Aardman Animation ('Wallace and Gromit' in particular), my wife and I had been looking forward to their first full-length feature film, with great expectations, ever since they first announced their plans in 1998.  With two years of heightened anticipation, we easily could have been disappointed with the results (shades of Star Wars Episode One).<br/><br/>After seeing the sneak preview this past weekend, I am please to report that we were not let down in the least!  This was a crackin' good movie! Okay, maybe the story was a bit predictable.  Still, it was the most fun we have had at a movie in a very long time.  I sat there for 88 minutes just marveling at the skill and imagination it must have taken to put something like this on the big screen.<br/><br/>Adults should definitely see this movie for the humor alone.  Your kids won't understand the bulk of it but you'll be laughing your heads off (i.e. Fowler's comment about Rocky, the American rooster, voiced by Mel Gibson: ""I'm not entirely convinced he's an American!""  Priceless.).  Very young children will definitely be disturbed by one scene where one hen meets her destiny on the chopping block (tastefully done, though).<br/><br/>With the advent of computers taking over the bulk of the animation chores in todays movies, its good to see old-fashioned, painstaking work achieve such marvelous results.  Now the painful wait begins for the next feature: 'The Tortoise and the Hare' (followed by 'The Wallace and Gromit Movie')! I'm betting it will be well worth the wait."

"B5LotRangers","10","1","2","13 July 2000"," Music to a play without words
","(no spoilers, comments on music and movie)<br/><br/>You would never expect a movie about plasticine chickens to be moving, or exciting, or anything but a happy farce. But as one person said, Chicken Run (and its music) is as far from Disney as Pink Panther is from Pocahontas. Not to say I don't like Disney. Dinosaur is one of the best scores ever, and the orchestral Lion King is also wonderful, but listen...<br/><br/>The tremendous variety has a lot of revisiting power. It has action and suspenseful music several times, exciting as U-571, Titan A.E. or Star Trek The Undiscovered Country. It's playful, energetic, happy _without_ being schmaltz, but has moments of intensely morose, dignified, sad music moving from military to unspeakably beautiful. There is NO boring low or LOUD AS BRASS music! It's like music to a play without words.<br/><br/>Despite the variety of music, it's drawn together by a multitude of themes. The main CR theme is played on kazoos (so that what that instrument is!), harmonica, some whistle instrument that sounds shrilly in Chickens are not Organized(!), flute and delicate piano. Sharp-eared viewers will note the main theme replays exactly at the end, with a very different scene being played out. There's a theme for the Rats, played in their debut track, the second half of Flight Training, and the middle of Building the Crate. It's light ethnic, like French/Italian.  The sound of awe near-end of We need a miracle is like a shorter one near-end of Flight Training and a longer awe on one of the end tracks, for a very good reason. There's also a theme for the Pie Machine. A bad kind of awe sound, the ""Crimson Tide"" male chorus referred to. And there's a small female chorus brilliantly used for short sections.<br/><br/>Anyone notice a small homage to Jaws, twice?<br/><br/>Also what dance tune is the first part of Flight Training built from? It sounds very familiar, but I can't place it.<br/><br/>This is over an hour of music, two-thirds of the movie, and it's easy to follow the movie or to happily guess what's happening if you haven't seen it. The tracks don't give away the plot points as easily as Star Wars Ep 1 and others.<br/><br/>I have nearly a hundred orchestral movie scores, and this is my best, along with Dinosaur (the score, not the movie). And this has two songs sung during pivotal points in the movie (not BY the chickens, don't worry), which hail from Big Joe Turner in '55, and Dion in '61.<br/><br/>Some country and Scottish snuck in there, too. Go! Go! Go! Go! (heard twice in CR) It's beautiful music, and should appeal to everyone. Listen to the samples, buy a copy, see the movie, which I already have thrice and write down more nuances I forgot each time. Email me if you want to talk about any aspect of the movie, especially the music!<br/><br/>The chances of us escaping are a million to one. Then there's still a chance. Ginger"

It doesn't take 10 seconds of heavy-booted footsteps to figure out a character is evil, but that's how this story is told.  And someone should advise the scriptwriters that a joke you can guess in advance (""beautiful chicks"") is not funny.<br/><br/>Sure, the animation is amazing.

One small child called out ""I no like this movie"" and three other people left. We all wanted to walk out, but kept thinking that it might get better. I liked the rats a tiny bit, but I can hardly believe the reviews this movie is getting. I always thought I enjoyed British humor, so I cannot believe this is why I didnt like Chicken Run.

","The claymation technique is creepy enough to begin with- to add on top of it a storyline centering on decapitation and the threat of it makes for one depressing little barnyard tale. The odd way that Mel Gibson has of jerking his head around on THE TONIGHT SHOW may have made him seem the ideal choice to play a rooster, but his voice is too deep and suave to suggest a bird. The basic chickenworld reality just doesn't come off as convincing or charming.  But I still gave it a 6 because of the cleverness of the physical production, the endearing character of Babs, and a scene at the end which actually made me laugh harder than I've laughed at a movie since SPINAL TAP: one which pokes fun at the absurdity of the whole conceit of anthropomorphic chickens."

Then along comes comes a stranger who uses his entrance to his advantage but is really unable to live up to his new friends expectations.  He later leaves out of fear of rejection and guilt of his deception, but then returns to help save the day.  This was very predictable and I had this one figured out about twenty minutes into the movie.  I could also tell they had borrowed from several other movies like ""Escape from Alcatraz"" and the classic ""The Great Escape"".

","I was exposed to Wallace and Gromit as a child and found it odd and a bit creepy. Looking at it as an adult, I find it creative and intriguing. The amount of time and effort to create claymations of these scales is astounding. I saw Chicken Run as a child as well and it resonated much more with me. Perhaps it was the longer exposition that helped solidify my connection to its characters.<br/><br/>Viewing Chicken Run as an adult is very different though. Perhaps its deeper message was stored within my subconscious but wasn't active till I experienced working within the capitalist system firsthand. Many people like to compare Tweedy's farm to the Nazi concentration camps but I don't believe that's an accurate comparison. The chickens were born into this system while the Nazi's prisoners were forced into it. The farm is all the chickens know and all the exploitation they experience seems normal to many of them. This is evident by Babs' response ""it's a living"" and the general befuddlement and even resistance to Ginger's speech about escaping the torment of the ""living,"" asking the question ""So laying eggs all your life and then getting plucked, stuffed, and roasted is good enough for you is it?"" This echoes the sentiment of revolutionary socialists who see the capitalist system as inherently exploitative and the unnecessary suffering that comes from it can only be eliminated by doing away with its unjust hierarchies. The top of the hierarchy of the farm is obviously Mrs. Tweedy, who represents the capitalists. Mr. Tweedy is the government and his dogs are the police/military. It actually coincides perfectly with how feudalism evolved into capitalism in how the farm is an heirloom of Mr. Tweedy's family. Before him, his family had complete control like the total monarchies of feudalism. But once he was coerced into giving control to his wife, the myth of unlimited growth fueled by greed runs the farm into the ground. This reflects the Marxist notion of the contradictions inherent to capitalism and the inevitable collapse they will cause. Ginger is the only one who sees this. While she's shown to have doubts, she knows that she must organize with her comrades to work as one to overthrow their masters. This is obvious when Mr. Tweedy says ""They're organised, I know it.""<br/><br/>The constant references to the chickens ""revolting"" and ""organizing"" made the movie's hidden message obvious to me when viewing it as an adult. I believe this is a great film to show to anyone who blames capitalism's problems on their fellow working class neighbors simply because they look different or believe different things. I believe it can subconsciously help them understand that it's the people with power, the ruling class, the oligarchs who are responsible for capitalism's problems. I hope that one day, we can all agree that we need to fight the over-privileged snobs who pit us against each other for their own gain. I still feel strong frisson when listening to this part of the soundtrack, and I hope it does for you too:"

","Mrs. Tweedy's farm produces eggs, and the greedy lady demands her chickens a good share of the day's production, or they end up in the pot. Therefore, the chickens face decided to organize and escape. Ginger is one of the ringleaders, and she already has many punishments for her rebellion but the countless failed escape attempts have demoralized the whole hen house. When they all began to settle for their fate, there arises Rocky, an American cock that seems to be able to fly and that breathes new life into the prisoners' dreams of freedom.<br/><br/>It's decidedly a remarkable film in every subject. Reminds me of ""The Great Escape"". Personally, I think the creators were inspired a lot in this film to idealize the whole plot. The scenarios are quite detailed and the soundtrack is very good. Technically, stop-motion animation (it's an Aardman Studios movie, and stop-motion is almost a studio tradition) is very good. It's not as good as in newer movies, where other materials were used, but it's positively realistic."
"rdc-59373","8","0","1","15 February 2018"," Best Chick Flick of 2000
","Chicken Run is a delightful little stop-motion picture film revolved around chickens that are tired of their boring old lives on the farm. One of the more daring chickens, Babs, knows that they are only being used to create eggs for the farmers and, once they cannot perform anymore they head to the chopping block. Knowing this, she desperately tries to escape the confinement that is the chicken coop, but she fails time and time again. One morning, out of the sky falls a rooster named Rocky who told the chickens that he knew how to fly and could teach them. Sadly, he had hurt his wing in the fall, so he could not do any demonstrations for the other chickens. Every day the chickens would practice flapping their wings and jumping off the rooves of their homes, but no luck. Then the wife, and the REAL owner of the farm, decides the eggs are not making enough money she invests in a machine that would consume mass amounts of chickens and turn them into ""homemade"" chicken pot pies. When the chickens realized this, they were in an absolute time crunch to escape their inevitable death. By this time, Rocky's wing had healed and they all demanded him do a demonstration for them the next morning. Knowing that he could not really fly on his own, he put up a poster that showed him getting shot out of a cannon and left in the middle of the night. The chickens were then forced to come up with another plan, they were going to build a plane. They stole supplies from the owners, Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy, as well as used wood from their own coops. The chickens were barely able to finish the plane in time to beat the machine being built. As they prepare the runway for takeoff Mrs. Tweedy attempts to sabotage them but, Rocky comes back to help. They launch off into the air thinking all is well but, in a last effort Mrs. Tweedy grabs on. They end up kicking her off and escape into the sunset. They then live happy ever after on their own island.<br/><br/>This movie was great for all ages, although it may be meant for younger children, anyone is able to enjoy the family-friendly movie. It really captivates the audience with its diverse genre category. It keeps things light with a lot of comedic scenes to overlook the darker plot of chickens being murdered. There were a handful of times I caught myself chuckling at the various scenes showing you do not need to be young to laugh at this movie. When Rocky arrives into the movie there is an obvious love story brewing between him and Babs, the main chicken behind all the schemes. This drama aspect of the film really gets the viewers to connect with the characters and feel for them. It creates a bond that really captures you into the movie. Lastly, their action-packed escape from the farmers and the death machine has viewers gripping their seats, wondering what is going to happen. <br/><br/>Throughout this movie the writers do a great job building suspense and keeping the viewer on edge. There are two main areas that demonstrate this well. The first being when Babs and Rocky get stuck in the pie making machine. Rocky sees Babs hanging upside down with her feet chained to a conveyor belt on the wall. He runs after her to try and catch her before she falls into a large metal tube that leads into the machine. The slow chase builds suspense in the viewers. Left and right they get so close to death, yet they somehow escape, each time by just a hair. Secondly, when they are in the middle of their final escape, Mrs. Tweedy is hanging on to a string of lights that got loose trying to take off. Babs is trying to cut the lights, so she falls but Mrs. Tweedy pulls out an axe and tries to chop her head off. After she swings we see just a chicken body holding on, giving the impression that she was dead, but she ducked just in time. The writers used this fight to build suspense and give us the false impression that the main character had just been killed.<br/><br/>This movie also uses a lot of classic editing styles. To start off they used the Three-Part POV shot inspired by Hitchcock many times when Mr. Tweedy would be spying on the chickens with his binoculars. We would see Mr. Tweedy in the window looking at the chickens, then we would view into the binoculars and see the chickens trying to fly, then it would zoom out and Mr. Tweedy would react with astonishment and check again. This time, he would just find them doing regular chicken-like activities. Another editing style they used which is used in many modern films is classical cutting. Many times, they would show characters walking out of frame and instead of following them it would just cut to another frame that they are just beginning to walk into as if it was just continuous the entire time."

It introduces a hen named Ginger who has made every attempt to escape her barb wire surroundings but her attempts are faltered by farmer Tweedy and his ruthless wife. Just when all seems hopeless a rooster named Rocky drops in seeking refuge from circus life. Ginger will conceal him in favour of flying lessons but unfortunately he cannot actually fly. They must work fast before they are subject to Tweedy's pie making machine. Surprising and innovative claymation flawed only with a silly conclusion where a chicken lugs implausible weight. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park with voices by Mel Gibson as Rocky who sees the confinement as an escape whereas the chickens await a dire fate. Julia Sawalha voices Ginger whom remains strong and hopeful despite the gloom of the situation. Miranda Richardson and tony Haygarth voice Mr and Mrs Tweedy who will meet defeat but not without a good dose of humour thrown in. Timothy Spall provides the voice of a rat who may remind viewers of the rat in Charlotte's Web who shares similar personality. While children may not grasp the prison film references, it is still wonderful family viewing where claymation take flight faster than the chickens. Score: 8 / 10"

","Chicken Run is a comedy escape drama with a touch of passion set on a sinister Yorkshire chicken farm in 1950s England.<br/><br/>Taking a page from ""Braveheart"", Nick Park weaves a tale of chickens who long to be free. There is even mention of ""free range"", though this term might be an anachronism. Either way, it is the similar style we have come to expect from the man, now with chickens. For many people, this might be awesome. Personally, I am not a huge fan of the style.<br/><br/>More interestingly, is how the film changed the Academy Awards. Allegedly, there was push to get this film a Best Picture nomination (which seems unlikely), and that push failed. But the Academy recognized the growing number of animated films and opened the door for them to have their own category. This has completely changed the way we look at animation each year."

At that point, I had never seen anything else from Aardman Animations. Three years and a few months later, I've finally watched this film again, after seeing Wallace & Gromit's full-length movie three times, as well as some Wallace & Gromit shorts, and much of the ""Angry Kid"" series. Comparing the two full-length movies, I would say the 2005 Wallace & Gromit one is the superior of the two, but ""Chicken Run"" is still a fine accomplishment.<br/><br/>Ginger is a chicken who lives on a chicken farm in England. The farm is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy, a dysfunctional couple, and the chickens know that if they don't produce any eggs in a week, they will literally lose their heads! Ginger knows that the only way to save herself and the others on the farm from this fate is to escape, so she leads the rest of them in many attempts to do so, but never succeeds. It eventually looks hopeless, until an American rooster named Rocky comes flying over and crashing down on the farm! The chickens are convinced he can actually fly, and can help them escape by teaching them how to do so. It turns out that he is from the circus, so Ginger makes a deal with him. If he gives the chickens flight lessons, she will hide him whenever the circus people come looking for him. Unfortunately, Rocky may not be very reliable, and he and Ginger have trouble getting along. Another problem is that an elder rooster on the farm named Fowler isn't too fond of Rocky. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tweedy now has a chicken pie-making machine and intends to make pies out of every chicken on the farm, so they are now in even more danger! <br/><br/>The humour in this film may not be as consistent as it could have been, but without a doubt, it's still there. For example, the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy is good for some laughs. Basically, Mr. Tweedy is a dimwitted farmer, married to a selfish, greedy, nasty woman, who sometimes insults him or gets a bit violent. Certain chickens can also be amusing at times, such as the airheaded Babs, with some of her lines (such as ""I don't want to be a pie. I don't like gravy.""), and so can Rocky. For the laughs, the film features a combination funny dialogue and slapstick. Not usually hilarious, but often amusing. To add to the entertainment value, not only is there humour, there's also some suspense, especially later on in the film, such as the pie machine sequence. There may be some dull moments in the film, but for the most part, it remains intriguing, sometimes with humour, sometimes with suspense, and sometimes both.<br/><br/>I haven't seen everything from Aardman Animations, but unlike the first time I saw this particular effort of theirs, I'm now familiar with some of their other work, and can't think of a time they've failed to impress me with their fine stop-motion animation, humour, adventure, etc. I think my second viewing of ""Chicken Run"" was pretty much like the first - not absolutely stunning, but pretty good nonetheless. Now that I'm familiar with Wallace & Gromit, two excellent, unforgettable, and very funny characters, I can say that maybe none of the characters in ""Chicken Run"" can quite match them, but some of them may come close. So, overall, this is an entertaining piece of animation which can appeal to many viewers, both kids and adults. It pretty much has everything that makes ""Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" so entertaining; the animation, the humour, the adventure, and likable characters, except to a smaller degree."

","Chicken Run (2000, Dir. Peter Lord, Nick Park) <br/><br/>Story <br/><br/>Aardman's first full theatrical stop motion film shows Ginger, Bunty, Babs and Fowler are chickens who are trapped on their farm and desperately want to escape. If they don't produce any eggs for the week, Mr and Mrs Tweedy will have their heads. After every attempt, they fail and their time is running out. When it seems like all their attempts have failed, an American rooster called Rocky falls into the farm. Seeing Rocky flying, Ginger now realises that the only way out now, is by flying. The chickens must learn the trade of flying before time runs outs.<br/><br/>Actors <br/><br/>The problem with movies using stop motion animation is that you don't actually see the actors, and instead must hear their voices. The cast chosen to provide the voices in this film have been chosen carefully in order for them to all suit their character. Benjamin Whitrow provides the perfect voice for Fowler. Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels make a wonderful comic team with the voices matching to the characters of Nick and Fetcher. Mel Gibson is also a nice addition as Rocky. The character really does feel as if he's a rooster from America. Mel is not a complete unknown actor and isn't too famous to distract you from the character. The only problem with the voices I have is Julia Sawalha. To me her voice just sounds awkward when blended in with the other characters. You could possibly say it is too English. This is only my opinion and may someone else might feel different about her 'thick' accent.<br/><br/>Music <br/><br/>The score in this film is actually very good. Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell give you a soundtrack which isn't a blatant rip-off of 'The Great Escape' but also has the same feeling to it. There are some good tunes hears and really fits in well with what is happening on screen. An animation film is harder to build up excitement than a live action film, and 'Chicken Run' is able to accomplish this by the use of the music. The music really builds up tension, especially in the scene, when the chicken are trying to fly off in their 'home-made' plane.<br/><br/>Special Effects <br/><br/>The only special effects I can really refer to is the animation techniques. Like all other popular Aardman material, the characters in the film are made with a kind of plasticine kind of material. Even today, there characters still look wonderful to watch and enjoy. It never puts the viewer off by what they are. It seems as anything is possible with these characters, as they moveand fly just like real people. All the buildings look amazing. So many different camera angles are used, that they do actually look as if they are real full-size sets.<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>Chicken Run, like all other Aardman movies, is a remarkable film. Not as memorable as the Wallace & Gromit series, but still a fun 'chick' flick. It's suitable for the whole family and contains jokes for the whole family to understand. It's not too short and not too long, and includes a story easily understandable by younger viewers. This is a perfect film to watch together on a wet weekend.<br/><br/>""I don't want to be a pie. I don't like gravy.""  Babs (Jane Horrocks)"

","Wallace & Gromit are two of the greatest characters in the history of animated film, and Nick Park is unquestionably a genius. I've seen Park's three short films, one better than the other, and I've just seen The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which is hilarious and filled with adult humor. I'm circling back to comment on ""Chicken Run,"" which seems to me to undermine the humor by cutting too close to the bone in its reliance on the Holocaust as a theme. ""The Producers"" and ""The Great Dictator"" exhausted whatever humor might be found in the doings of the Nazis, and Chicken Run falls decidedly short. Nick Park is neither Mel Brooks nor Charlie Chaplin, and Chicken Run is far darker than the Brooks and Chaplin films. The tragedy of the Holocaust has also been done exceptionally well -- most of all, to my taste, in ""The Pawnbroker,"" though ""Schlindler's List"" was also excellent and the film about Hungarian Jews -- Sonnenschine or Sunshine (I've forgotten the exact title) featuring Ralph Fiennes as a defiant officer who is murdered by his Nazi tormentors in one of the grisliest scenes ever --all treat the subject with great effectiveness and emotional weight. Park's otherwise impeccable taste failed him in this movie."

","Its always a pleasure to see an animated, clay rendered movie, that has a hero, antagonist and a romantic story-line, with some humour along the way.

The phenomenal amount of detail, right down to the when Ginger leaves the charcoal bin covered in soot highlights the directors attention to intricacy. However the slow-paced and implausible storyline fails to ensnare adults and older children's attention.<br/><br/>The whimsical and monotonous storyline features the unsuccessful frequent escape attempts from the prison-like Tweedy farm lead by altruist, Ginger. Ginger's irritating determination is illustrated in the beginning of the film, shortly before the tyrannical, influential Mrs Tweedy is introduced. Mrs Tweedy is sick of making miniscule profits and with that decides to leave the business of egg farming, to chicken pies. It soon becomes a matter of life and death for the chickens to escape, and Gingers prayers are soon answered by the cocky and very arrogant Rocky, who has escaped from the circus.<br/><br/>References to Stalag 17 and The Great Escape are crammed into scenes making no impact on the audience, from the movies being so long-standing.

The animation in ""Chicken Run"" is excellent and the use of an all star cast to provide major voice roles throughout the film is also a plus but this film is usually kind of boring when it is compared to the aforementioned films.

","This was a great film for kids, a visual feast from the Aardman team, but I just wished it had provided just a little more for grown-ups. I have to agree with previous writers that the script didn't stand up to the quality of the animation, with jokes that just weren't always funny. I wouldn't go so far to say that Chicken Run was 'totally forgettable' however, as this film has stayed in my head since first seeing it nearly a week ago. Where the script fell down the visual gags held it together, and indeed the impressive animation gives one enough to ponder on in technical terms. How anyone can say that this film is too scary for kids I just don't know, even with the beheading sequence. One of the best things about Aardman animation is the sense of reality it envokes in spite of the ludicrous situations, rather than being just another oversensitive piece of fluff production-line flick. If anything I would have preferred a Ginger with a little more gusto since, despite her role as the central character, the delivery of her lines sometimes seemed a bit weak and watery for such a driven leader-of-the-coop type character. If Aardman really wanted to make this film stand out (AND still be a role-model for kids) then instead of ending up in a happy-ever-after type paradise Ginger would be going on to free other hens in even worse conditions: Chicken Run II: The Breakout from Battery Hell. But all in all this was a good evening's light entertainment."

Maybe this was the fault of the full-length format.  Maybe a bit more 'veggie' irony also (for example in Babe). I also found I didn't care whether the chickens went into the mincer or not!!

Brooding over yet another scheme, the desperate Ginger prays for a miracle and Rocky the rooster comes flying into her life.  Rocky agrees to teach the chickens how to fly and the race against time and the Tweedys begins.  Viewers of all ages will laugh at the antics that ensue.  Adults will appreciate the brilliantly subtle relationship that develops between Rocky and Ginger.  Mrs Tweedy is one of the most menacing villains ever. The rest of characters provide non-stop comic relief and are very endearing. Nick Park and company did a great job of balancing the action and dialogue to give this movie a broad appeal across all age groups.  The claymation was excellent and stood up to close up shots.

Some jokes are old, some are just dumb, many are corny and none are subtle, they very obviously had a forum and plonked in all the chicken puns they could. Some things are a little too harsh to appeal to all ages, mainly decapitating a terrified duck. The prison camp idea is not really explored well, though it has a million nods to 'The Great Race'. It also explores all trodden territory, like choosing to make an effort to get free, learning to cooperate with people you dont like, and going back on a profession that you dont care about someone, the kids love that stuff but older people yawn at it. Braveheart comes into it, the jokes based on it come off the funniest. The vocals don't credit Mel very much, nor the rest of the cast.

","There's nothing worse than dry Chicken, and this is really dry.  This is a remake of the ""Great Escape"" told from the P. O. V. of chickens. See the original instead. The problem is they're CHICKENS!, so who cares if they escape or not.  All this movie did for me is make me hungry for chicken pot pie.  <br/><br/>The creators of this Show should stick to shorts that have one or two chuckles, instead of a full length movie with one or two chuckle.  I guess brain dead children (The only kids that could sit through this whole thing) and people with a thing for clay (Which by the votes is a lot) will like this movie. <br/><br/>The only reason I gave it a 5 was there was nothing offensive in it, and it was cute(whoopty do!)"
"falster","5","0","2","17 December 2000"," Fairly standard, with the added creepiness of chickens kissing.
","Undoubtedly, I feel mean critisizing this movie, being a fan of W&G, and seeing the amazing amount of work that was put into getting it made. However, I couldnt help but find it, well, dull.<br/><br/>The plot was fairly predictable, with a few too many similarities with A Bugs Life (Rocky inspiring the chickens, while hiding a secret circus past, their escape, the final shot). Practically all the humour was derived from an infinate amount of puns, which were laid down a bit too thick. They even resorted to pointing out some which we may of missed (""D'oh! Get it? Dough...""). ergh! Talk about overkill. And the worst thing is that you can't stop saying them yourself! Just try describing Rocky without using the work 'cocky'.<br/><br/>And the characters, unfortunately, were also fairly bland. There was no one who you actually cared about, and I found Ginger was a bit too uptight and whiney, with Julia Sawalha just being Saffy all over again  (who else cheered in Ab Fab when she was sold as a Morrocan slave?). And there's something about chicken's kissing that unnerves me and creeps me out.<br/><br/>I must sound like I absolutely hated it. It was alright, and it had it's moments. It just suffered from a standard plot, with many conventional things thrown in that just didnt fit. Not to mention bad lead characters, a boring villain, a few too many puns, and kissing chickens. Good for the kids. Otherwise dissappointing and forgettable."
"Indy-52","Null","0","1","17 December 2000"," who cares about the fate of a bunch of chickens?
","the plot of this movie was not very original. I found the fake bird scene very reminiscent of A BUG'S LIFE, which is better than this one. CHICKEN RUN was quite boring, and sometimes you couldn't understand what they were saying. I did appreciate all the effort put into this movie. The ""claymation"" is fantastic!"
"Filmtwob","Null","0","1","9 December 2000"," The film had an original concept and a 'blah' execution.
","Basic plot outline: A 'claymation' adventure from the creator of Wallace and Gromit, featuring chickens as the main characters. Ginger is the 'head chick', and she deviously plots to free all the chickens on the farm, preventing an otherwise certain 'Death By Chicken Pie'. After many failed attempts, she meets Rocky, the 'flying rooster', and decides that he holds the key to their freedom. <br/><br/>Review: This film was very disappointing. The animation was superb, and the characters were quite cute and funny and stuff. But thats pretty much all there was to it. It wasn't as entertaining as it could have been. The film had an original concept and a 'blah' execution. WAAaaaaAAAy over rated."
"ryanjw","Null","0","1","23 November 2000"," Don't get dragged into this.
","This is just my person opinion of this film, so take it for what is. And if you got any complaints about this review, you can direct them to that brick wall right over there *points to brick wall*<br/><br/>I got dragged to this movie by my parents and did NOT want to go.. But, being the avid movie watcher that I am.. I thought to myself ""How bad can this really be?"" well my question was answered.. ""One of the worst movies EVER."" Mel Gibson totally embarasses himself in this film.. And I don't even know who the other people are in it. If you are looking to waste 2 hours, then by all means, go see this movie.. But if you'd like to see a movie of a better calibur, and the world's greatest actor, go see Major League 2, with Tom Beringer!"
"edinger","6","0","1","17 October 2000"," Chicken Run ain't no Chicken Fun!
","What is it about this film that, apparently, has everyone cheering and giggling. I don't see it. I just don't. I mean, having watched over and over again the superior Wallace & Gromit trilogy one's entitled to expect a certain level of quality. However, Nick Park and Peter Lord fall terribly short with Chicken Run. It seems to me that the Hollywood influence (Jeffrey Katzenberg/Dreamworks) has been counterproductive in terms of the originality of the script and the depth of the storytelling.<br/><br/>The animation, though, is splendid!<br/><br/>IMDb rating: 6/10"
"akesti","5","0","2","11 August 2000"," Chicken Run flies short of a good fare
","Chicken Run is a Burger King kids' meal. But the movie is not family fare. In the Pie Machine scene, mothers were removing their hysterical 6-year-olds. Children old enough to understand that this an animated farce, along with adults, would be too old for a Burger King kids' meal.<br/><br/>The animation, as good as it is, has not the story as clever as creators' hit series, Wallace and Gromit, a witty commentary on contemporary life. Chicken Run croaks with the silly American rooster.  He makes the black British humor too banal.<br/><br/>As a sophisticated dark picture, Chicken Run flies onto the chop block. Make that a deluxe chicken sandwich with fries."
"alice liddell","6","0","2","14 August 2000"," So-so.
","Good things about 'Chicken Run': genuinely feminist; even more genuinely socialist (in an Old Labour, let's-all-help-each-other-out kind of way).  It magnificently mocks hollow American bluster, and its animated style is refreshingly different, if stilted, in a world of Hollywood conformity.<br/><br/>Less good things: formulaic plot.  Dearth of interesting characters. Insularity of vision.  Average, rarely hilarious dialogue.  Gleeful luddism. Island mentality, unironically referred to as reward.  Hackneyed aping of Alan Bennett sans humour or pathos.  Very British."
"The_Movie_Cat","5","0","3","10 July 2000"," ""So, was it as good as you expected?""
","No... it's worse. I have the unfortunate distinction of sitting next to a woman at work so obsessed with all animal kind that she spends her evenings baking jacket potatoes for her bird table. With grated cheese for topping. No joke. In fact, so near is she to the welcoming arms of insanity that she claims keeping fish in tanks is ""captivity"" and campaigns for the rights of maggots. And so it was that I went to see Chicken Run, not because I wanted to, but to shut up an eccentric colleague who asks me if I've seen it on a twice-daily basis.<br/><br/>On the positive side, thrice-Oscar winner Nick Park might be working with an American company for the first time but he doesn't sell out. Animation's first-rate and the humour is still as English as Wallace and Gromit. The inclusion of Mel Gibson as Rocky the Rooster also fits. Amusingly, Gibson's Rocky fails to understand a chicken with a Scottish accent, which may come to explain his own attempt in Braveheart. Most of the better jokes  such as multiple references to The Great Escape, The Weather Girls and a weak Star Trek spoof  got laughs from the adults but were lost on the child demographic. They're treated to a predictable series of self-conscious blinks, double takes and pratt falls, which over-egg (geddit?) the joke a little. As for the child audience, despite some comic violence, it does warrant it's ""U"" certificate. The only odd point is, in a film devoid of bad language, the sole usage of the word ""bugger"". A mild English expletive, bearing in mind its actual meaning, it should be more offensive to right-wing middleclass audiences than the ""f"" word. The fact that it is patently isn't is an interesting lesson in the misplaced priorities of linguistic experts.<br/><br/>There's always the nagging feeling that the plot isn't long enough for it's 90m duration, or that the jokes aren't funny enough. Pipe smokers may urge an Orwellian perspective on the class divide, but it's really just a so-so ""see it if you really like that sort of thing"" kid's film about plasticine chickens. But at least my deranged co-worker can now finally be silenced."
"NoWayOut","10","0","1","7 July 2000"," This movie is (as much as I hate puns) egg-sellent.
","Yes, this movie did indeed kick ass! I went and saw it with my little cousin (I wouldn't go see it by myself! Especially at my age!). I think I enjoyed it more than he did, it is funny, sad, and very amusing to watch. The gags and everything make  you die of laughter, especially the rats, they steal the show.<br/><br/>This movie is the best movie of the summer, so far... SO GO SEE IT!"
