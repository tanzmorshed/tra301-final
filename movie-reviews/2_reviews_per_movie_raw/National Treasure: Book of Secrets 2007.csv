","National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a decent film. Nothing more, nothing less. I came out of the theater content, and yet by the next hour I'd forgotten much of what had taken place. Such is the case for most films now, however.<br/><br/>Compared to the first film, the plot is weak (certainly not as tightly drawn as the former) but the energy is the same and the humor is the same, and overall it's still as watchable as the first. Helen Mirren and Ed Harris were also very good, and somewhat surprising, additions to the cast.<br/><br/>Essentially, the movie is on the ridiculous/unbelievable side, but it's worth a watch. I don't think I'd pay another 10 dollars to see it again in theaters, but waiting for a rental will do."

","During a lecture about John Wilkes Booth and Thomas Gates, Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) and his father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) are surprised by Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) that claims that their ancestor was a conspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln based on the missing page of Booth's diary that he possesses. The outraged Ben decides to prove the honor of his ancestor and together with his wife Abigail (Diane Kruger) and his best friend, the writer Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), they head to France, England and Washington to collect clues to lead them to a lost city of gold Cinola and clean the name of Thomas Gates. But Mitch Wilkinson is following each step of Ben and his friends to take the merit of finding the treasure for himself.<br/><br/>""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is an entertaining and full of action adventure that follows the style of Indiana Jones combined with ""Da Vinci Code. The story is developed in high pace, with likable characters and funny situations. Nicolas Cage and the gorgeous German Diane Kruger show a wonderful chemistry and Jon Voight, Justin Bartha and Helen Mirren give a magnificent support. Ed Harris is a very confused and ambiguous villain and his true motives are never clear, Harvey Keitel has a minor role and Bruce Greenwood performs again the role of president of the United States of America that seems to be tailored for this great actor. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Lenda do Tesouro Perdido – Livro dos Segredos"" (""The Legend of the Lost Treasure – Book of Secrets"")"

","I will keep it short and simple. Just watched it, paid 10$ for it, it is worth it. Not much of details as you would expect out of a great movie, not much of substance in the movie itself however the acting and the pace of the movie is so beautiful you wont think of the flaws in the intricate plans they carry out in the movie. The subtle comedy is really nice and they have kept the first movie in consideration and have not brought many new characters. It is not a movie that you would think a lot about after you come out of the hall, however you will not think anything else either while the movie is going on. I will give it 7 for the sheer value of entertainment and nothing else and of course the one liners that keep popping up which actually make you laugh."

","*****Spoiler Ahead STOP Now*****<br/><br/>This was a classic case of sequel trying to live off the fervor of the original but had gone bad in horrible ways.<br/><br/>So if you want to view this pathetic excuse for a movie stop reading now, go see it, then finish this slash and burn review.<br/><br/>The movie speed was a dreadful snooze for many minutes at a time. I found myself actually more entertained looking around the theater to see if other people were doing the same. <br/><br/>The story started out plausible and there may even be a tiniest shred of actual history to support the artistic privileges the story writers embarked on. Let me think.. Lincolns assassination and a letter from the French to the Confederate Union, 3 statues of Liberty, 2 identical desks (Oval office and in the Queens of England's Office), and Mount Rushmore _IS_ located in South Dakota and not in South America.<br/><br/>I have a SERIOUS beef with this Disney Production on that last one. Everybody who watched this movie left there dumber than they entered. The gullible people out there probably think there is a lake on the top (or within walking distance of the top) of Mount Rushmore. Even WORSE people may actually believe that an ancient Mayan culture lived in South Dakota, built caverns, and then transported and lined them with tons of gold. Sure why not, it's a movie! <br/><br/>The story leaped from Dad's house, to the Gates' mansion, to Paris, to London, to University of Maryland, to the White House, to a Presidential retreat, to the Library of Congress, to Mount Rushmore, to a Lake *on* Mount Rushmore... all seemingly in a span of a day or two. I guess it is technically possible to zip around the world like that but jet lag would have surely taken its toll... yet everybody seemed fine. The one place they did not get even remotely close to was South America. Hello! The major story line leaned heavily on the Mayan civilization. WTF?<br/><br/>Seems the story writers (perhaps in response to the critics) wanted to liven up the snooze screen play so they injected a ridiculous car chase. Complete with self repairing cars, drifting sequences, bullets at point blank range that hit everything but the target, and my new favorite... using the red light camera to take a photo (then getting that photo back later) of Mayan writing at high speeds. Yeah... right. <br/><br/>Ed Harris should have stayed out of this one. His performance mechanics were fine but the story writers simply didn't know what to do with him. Seemed as if the original plot had him doing more but huge chunks of character development were left on the cutting room floor.. well, we can hope that. This might have been the best the writers could have mustered.<br/><br/>Abigale was useless. Oh, she had her 60 seconds of lines but that was about it. The story writers made a horribly obvious ""fix"" to the story using her. She just magically appeared in the right place (she was in the States earlier) and the right time without any coordination to help Benjamen sneak into the Queens office. Plausibility... Zero.<br/><br/>Riley was cute and lovable as before. The writers tried overly hard to capitalize on this comedic charm. What the heck... he's pretty handy with an IPod and a laptop. <br/><br/>Benjamen, as a positive role model for a _Disney_ film, should go to jail. Let's count the offenses: Speeding, reckless driving, theft, trespassing, destruction of property, conspiracy to kidnap, and kidnapping. Disney thinks this is all fine since he's the ""hero"" after all. Thanks Disney! <br/><br/>I have no idea why the Feds were in this film. They didn't do anything until the very end... but that was only after Benjamen called them.<br/><br/>The ""book"" was a pathetic story prop. They could have used a spoon or pile of play dough. If only the book had been used throughout the movie... Nope, that would take real story writing skills.<br/><br/>Nitpicks... 1) I doubt ""duplicated"" cell phones really allow you to receive a call in two locations at once. 2) The story title ""Book of Secrets"" relates to a book that had a total of 30 seconds relevance (I am being generous here) to the whole story. 3) Cliché, the bad guys hijack ridiculous vehicles in a high speed chase. In this case a truck loaded with kegs of beer. 4) Security in the Queens Office seems laughable. Just walk in, take what you want and walk out. 5) Riley can remotely unlock security gates and set off fire alarms from a restroom. Seems the Disney group has a low opinion of British security. 6) Riley also has super human strength. He picked up a block of gold and by the look of it should have been about 400lbs. 7) Cliché, ""let's turn this spinner/lever thing and see what happens""... not once.. but 5 freaking times.... yawn. 8) Hey.. didn't they have one of those rolling doors in Indiana Jones? 9) Oh sh*t we're all going to drown... panic!!! Let's all go to the lowest point in this crisis and speed up the drownings. What's that? A glimpse of sunlight from above? How about treading water until things fill up so you can walk out. Nope can't do that. Got to have another unnecessary plot complication to wipe out the useless bad guy.<br/><br/>Summing up. The ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" will join the ranks of sequel movie blunders. Story writers never made clear why chasing after this lost city of gold would prove that Gate's great great grandfather was not a Confederate collaborator. WTF is up with this lake on Rushmore and this Mayan culture. Generally, the story was fragmented, slow, clichés everywhere, gross leaps from plausibility, and a disgustingly irresponsible display of story telling by Disney."
"JWJanneck","2","106","162","26 December 2007"," Nonsense production for an audience without expectations.
","I had seen the previous National Treasure, and armed with that memory and the knowledge that this was a Disney movie, I watched its sequel without a great deal of expectations---predictable adventure drivel, Indiana Jones with more modern special effects, is what I expected. But this movie manages to disappoint even fairly modest expectations such as those.<br/><br/>In the end it really comes down to two problems: (1) It doesn't make any sense. (2) The acting is awful.<br/><br/>On (1), I really don't mean to nitpick on historical minutiae---hell, I'd be happy to suspend disbelief for two hours on stuff such as Lincoln's assassination, Mayan treasures, Mount Rushmore geography, and all that other nonsense. No problem there. But the point of a treasure hunt movie is the ability to follow the main character in his struggle, perhaps struggle with him, see him figure things out and perhaps guess with him. For this to work, the universe of the movie doesn't have to be consistent with the world we live in, but it has to be consistent with itself. But the universe of this movie is like a great big fairy tale, with the central character pulling white rabbits out of his sleeve whenever he needs them. Yes, the movie tries its hand at some drama, but it just doesn't work. Things go pretty smoothly for the most part---into the Queen's office, out of it again, oops, we are being chased, heck, let's take a photo, oh no camera, ah, there is a traffic camera, yep and by the way, can you just hack into the computer and download the pic, and on to the next event (same thing with the oval office, then kidnapping the president). While the hero thus McGyvers his way through an increasingly preposterous story, the whole thing just starts to feel stale, and you get the feeling that it might have been better if he had not stolen the Constitution in part 1, so the writers would not have to top this. The villain is lame and for the most part useless, not to speak of somewhat incoherent (""I am not going last, so I might as well go first""---say what?).<br/><br/>None of the story really makes the slightest bit of sense, including the motivation of the hero (to clear the name of his great-great-grandfather---that's why he risks his life, the life of friends and loved ones, not to speak of his own good name by kidnapping a president!). It's all just a steaming pile of nonsense aimed at people who really do not give a damn about story and stuff, but who just want to see a lot of movement/action, high-tech gobbledygook, explosions, and cheap patriotism.<br/><br/>However, as bad as the story was, (2), the bad acting was even worse. Everybody in this movie was disappointing, even a non-actor like Kruger. Her career should end with this movie, over, out, finito. She cannot do it, and it's not been for a lack of opportunity. If you had a consistent record of failure like hers in any regular job, you'd find yourself with a lot of spare time very soon. But even the real actors here just make you cringe---Greenwood, Harris, Mirren, Voight, they all deliver horrible performances that seem to betray their lack of passion and their paycheck mentality. We know they *can* act, we have seen it before, but they just don't in this movie. Keitel comes away without much harm---his part is so tiny, there just isn't a lot of opportunity to screw things up too badly.<br/><br/>Why oh why do they keep making this fluff? Because for some reason we attend it. We go there, drop our cash, and watch this nonsense. I am guilty as charged. But if you haven't seen it, you and your money can still make a difference. Watch a good movie. There are plenty out there."
"violentsociopath","7","139","217","24 December 2007"," An entertaining movie
","There are a select few individuals out there that seem to garner everything they know about life from movies, be it political viewpoints, philosophy, etc. and find it objectionable when a movie is produced purely for entertainment purposes. I can't speak for everyone, but as for myself, I don't want to have to pay to have yet another political viewpoint shoved down my throat (CNN/Foxnews broadcasts 24/7 for that), or to be beaten over the head with with the life philosophy of some bazillionaire producer/director that lives in the Ivory Tower that is Hollywood. I can read Zarathustra, the Tao Tse Ching, or even the Bible for that.<br/><br/>When I go to see a movie, I just wan to be entertained, and National Treasure BoS delivers there. Not the best movie I have ever seen, but it was an entertaining escape from reality for two hours and that it was I pay my money for. For me, the best part of the movie wasn't Nic Cage. He has done so many movies, it seems like he has gotten to the point where he is just punching the clock. He doesn't stand out on film, but he isn't horrible either and that is what we get from him here - a very pedestrian workmanlike performance. I would like to think he has another touchstone performance in him like the one he gave in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", but if he can still keep getting several million per movie just being average, why put in the effort. Diane Kruger was also pretty average. She shined in the first movie, but not so much here.<br/><br/>For me, John Voight, Justin Bartha and Helen Mirren were what made the movie good. John Voight was great. His character was both funny and endearing and the synergy between him and Mirren was palpable. Mirren showed once again why she is arguably the best actress in the business. Justin Bartha was a scene stealer and had some of the funniest lines (along with Voight)."
"itamtodd","2","21","30","28 December 2007"," Sorry No Treasure Here.
","Well, I guess I should have known going into this one that it was going to have absolutely no plot. The whole film is based on some notion of family honor. Basically Nicolas Cage was so sick of being considered a wacko for all those years that the second anyone tried to trash his name he was up for a fight. Is this not the biggest crock? I mean, it's based on the premise, that if your distant relatives did bad things you should: A) Feel extremely bad for said acts even though you had nothing to do with them. B) Give extreme credit and worry to those who would look down on you for this and C) Risk life and limb and also endanger the lives of others to clear your dead relatives of said bad accusations. What an awful justification for all of his acts! I think there are many many people in this country that have relatives whom have engaged in horrible things (i.e. slavery, extermination of Native Americans, etc..) I hope they are not prone to engage in A,B, or C of the above.<br/><br/>So, with the foundation of a horrible ""goal"" in mind we are painfully pulled through two hours of the first national treasure movie once again just without the surprise of Gates' bold and illegal moves There was just absolutely no shock when it was like ""we have to go to the White House! Again.. (enter dramatic music Dun dun dun.) All the magic of the first movies was wonderfully duplicated making this movie predictable in the extreme.<br/><br/>Sure it was historically, and geographically a mess with Mt.Rushmore being right over the hill from a nice lake, ancient South American empires in a South Dakota basement, etc Oh, by the way, the two romantic characters of the first movie that appeared in many the cute and charming scenes that fell in love after the whole ordeal. Yea those two, well they are separated (not divorced) and one of them is kissing on other men. Sorry, didn't last long. I know what can get them back together! Another great adventure! So just to recap that one, they had ""cleared their name"" for such a short time that this whole trek was necessary to return honor to the family but the love of the two was so strong in the end of the final movie only lasted that long. Hum Can I get my 15 bucks back? Wait for the video or at least the cheap seats!"
"liberalgems","1","54","87","28 December 2007"," What A Disney Disaster! Another Sterile Movie For the Masses!
","There's so much wrong about this pitiful film I don't know where to start! As an adult, I found National Treasure: Book of Secrets the most boring movie I have seen on the big screen all year. I had to use every ounce of will power not to walk out of the theater and demand my money back!<br/><br/>Before the movie even started, I was forced to sit through an infuriatingly dopey Disney cartoon, which was nothing more than a not-so-subtle commercial for expensive T.V. and stereo equipment. It went on and on and on. Finally I had to close my eyes in order not to get overly aggravated! Wow! How low Disney has sunk to make a buck.<br/><br/>The story was written to the level of a 10 year old! There's close to nothing to entertain an adult. It's a blatant and poorly done rip-off of Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>I can deal with a story that's preposterous if it's enjoyable. But kidnapping the president by walking him through a tunnel. How exciting! Finding a Central or South American city hidden thousands of miles away in the Badlands of South Dakota! Yikes!, how insulting to all the Plains Indian tribes can you get? Or, how dumb do you think the American movie going audience is? Can at least a modicum of reality seep into the story?<br/><br/>The special affects are so trite! The props look so fake that I thought they were using an amusement park to film this movie. I was waiting for a water slide to show up any moment! <br/><br/>The acting was pitiful! Nicholas Cage had such a painful look throughout the movie I though he must either be embarrassed or ashamed of himself for stooping so low. I realize actors need to make a living. But he, of all people, can pick and choose his film projects. <br/><br/>The only good thing I could think of is the scene with President and a cameo of a Hillary Clinton look-alike at the President's birthday party. Since the Hillary cameo was having such a good time at the party, it can be assumed the Democrats won the 2008 election!"
"grandslam40","8","60","98","27 December 2007"," Interesting...I liked It, but something feels missing...
","First of all, National Treasure, the first one, is one of my favorite movie ever. I love history, specifically American history, and it had clever references and facts about American history that lead to finding the treasure in a way that is not predictable. That being said, I felt something was missing in National Treasure: Book of Secrets. It almost felt like the writers could not think of any new, clever clues for Nicolas Cage to solve or more suspense without action scenes.<br/><br/>First lets look at the positives. This movie was very well-done. The acting was as superb as the first (Nicolas Cage and Justin Bartha are amazing). It was very believable. Also the action scenes are excellent and full of invigorating suspense. The scene near the unexpected end where they had to balanced the steel block thing in the cave was terrific. All the action scenes were awesome: right out of an Indiana Jones movie. Another thing I liked was the ironic humor and sarcasm used by Nicolas Cage's character and other characters throughout the movie that gave it a light, fun feel. With interesting history references and a brilliant score by Trevor Rabin, what could be wrong with it?<br/><br/>You may not agree with me. But I felt that the ending, and a few other scenes were rushed. For example, they spent literally about five minutes in Paris both finding and figuring out the clue. After that they moved on to London, they spent about 15 minutes there, 5 of them were spent finding the clue. It all felt rushed which tended to confuse me. And the ending definitely did not satisfy me. It was too sudden and I felt it was incomplete, even though the movie was over two hours long. <br/><br/>As I think back to some of the scenes in the beginning and middle of the movie, I forget why I included ""negatives"" because it was so brilliant and I loved it as much as the first one. But then I remember the ending. it just didn't satisfy like the last movie did. I can't explain the nice feeling the first movie gave me: its what the perfect movie gives you I guess. Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone who has scene the first one and anyone who would like a good crime/action/adventure flick with excellent acting with lovable and believable characters. It's a great movie, it just didn't live up to my expectations or the original's"
"barrys82","7","48","77","1 January 2008"," Enjoyable and recommendable
","It was a good movie but not as good as the first one. I think that its just the same story as the first one with very little changes. Treasure hunter Ben Gates tries to clean its name by looking for an ancient treasure. The first half of the movie is kinda slow and even tiresome, too much talking and very little action. But it gets better on the second part towards to the end. The cast is excellent, Nicolas Cage in a role he knows very well, Jon Voight as Cage fathers is very convincing, Ed Harris is the bad guy that the only thing he wants is to find the treasure and keep it to himself, Harvey Keitel as an FBI agent wit a brief but convincing performance and Helen Mirren as Nicola's mother with a good and even funny performance. Although this movie isn't the greatest thing, it is very enjoyable and entertaining, perfect to spend some time with the family."
"Oleoay","2","33","51","30 December 2007"," National Horror: Book of Secrets
","I'm generally a fan of these kinds of topics that include history and some puzzle riddles. I enjoyed reading Da Vinci Code and a variety of Clive Cussler/James Rollins books. I also saw the first National Treasure and though I wasn't thrilled, it wasn't a horrible movie.<br/><br/>*SPOILER WARNING* Then Disney had to do a sequel.<br/><br/>The good: As pretty much everyone has mentioned, the best part was the Goofy cartoon. Truth be told, the concept of hunting for Cibola was a decent concept too. I'll also give Helen Mirren some props for being a bit of an interesting character.<br/><br/>The bad: The problems I had with the first National Treasure are even more prevalent in this one. Here you have a father (Voight), son (Cage), and a museum curator (Kruger) all for protecting history and yet have a habit of destroying historical artifacts. Fold up the Declaration of Independence? Sure. Throw an example of rare Native American hieroglyphs into the river? Yep, you bet.<br/><br/>Of course, before tossing the hieroglyphs, it took a 5+ minute car chase where _nothing_ happens except repeated shots of a certain automobile maker's logo being pictured on every single turn and captured by the traffic camera.<br/><br/>Also, it makes me feel safe knowing that the Queen's study, the Oval Office and the Library of Congress are so easy to break into. And if I ever get the chance to kidnap the president, it's nice to know he's the kind of guy who will allow me unescorted and unrestricted access to see the nation's secrets. Yep, that ""Book of Secrets"", the title of the movie, takes up as much screen (and plot time) as the opening credits... and much less than the car chase. But it provides a convenient segue to a sequel around page 47 of the book of secrets. Maybe it was the plot summary? So now, off to Mt. Rushmore which was built to obscure some landmarks (which weren't hinted at in any of the clues) on a map (which also wasn't in any of the clues, nor found)... OK, so our intrepid adventurers are in the middle of the Black Hills, though it's not quite clear whether they're actually on top of Mt. Rushmore or not. Let's assume they are on Mt. Rushmore, narrowing the search area from around 600 sq miles (the area of the Black Hills) to Mt. Rushmore which is a few square miles. So, they become enlightened when they realize water turns rocks darker... (not to mention clothes, and pretty much everything else) Lo and behold, they happen to find the exact spot. Some puzzle solving, huh? They're now on their way to Cibola. (That's assuming, of course, that no one had read a 6th grade history textbook about how Cibola wasn't that far north).<br/><br/>Then, after some funky physics on a huge stone platform built inside a carved-out mountain by Stone Age tech Native Americans, a bit of flooding, one of our ""defenders of history"" rips up a 5 ft by 5 ft gold brick out of the ground _with_one_hand_ and tosses it in his backpack.<br/><br/>Seriously, this movie made Sahara look plausible (even if you hadn't read the book).<br/><br/>Enough about the plot... as far as acting goes, I remember a time when Nicholas Cage was the future of acting. I just don't see how a guy can go from 8mm or Lord of War, to movies like this and Ghost Rider. You could almost hear the drum roll before and after Justin Bartha delivered one of his zillion one-liners, but it was pretty silent. Kruger's character behaves exactly opposite of how an educated lady who has an ex-boyfriend break into her house should... then again, considering how roughly she treated the Declaration of Independence in the first movie, I shouldn't be surprised about her make-out session on the floor of the Oval Office. The one I feel worst for is Ed Harris, whose character had multiple personalities and all of them were bland. It was almost like the writers were trying so hard not to use a villain similar to the first National Treasure... but then they'd occasionally realize they needed a villain to keep the plot moving. Ed Harris should know better than to take these kinds of roles... maybe that's why he dropped his accent by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>If you made it this far, perhaps you think I obsessed too much about the plot holes, the blatant disrespect of historical artifacts. That should be a sign that the movie did not catch my attention. Hey, the movie ""300"" isn't historically accurate, but not only was it entertaining, it also didn't try to pass itself off as legit with monsters and golden-skinned Persian emperors.<br/><br/>The scary thing about a movie like National Treasure 2 is that people will watch it and think that's how historians, archaeologists and even private treasure hunters act. They'll probably spout off the same cliché one-liners too."
"jon.h.ochiai","8","39","65","28 December 2007"," Fun Book of Secrets
","This time around in ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" Benjamin Gates (Nicholas Cage) and his father Patrick (Jon Voight) exonerate the good name of Great Grandfather Gates for the heinous assassination coup of Abraham Lincoln. Ed Harris's Mitch Wilkinson makes this startling allegation along with possessing incriminating evidence of a long held family letter. Also in prescribed convoluted fashion clearing the Gates family name explicably leads to the search for the mythical City of Gold thought to be built by Native American Ancestors. Go figure. Clues to The City of Gold are uncovered from the desks of the Queen of England and the Oval Office itself. The key to The City of Gold and the Lincoln Conspiracy is concealed in the ubiquitous Book of Secretsan urban legend of sorts. The Book of Secrets originated in the Hayes Administration, and consequently handed down to each succeeding President. Apparently, this Book documents all of our National Secrets running the gamut from Area 51 to the final Warren Commission Report. To obtain The Book of Secrets, Ben must kidnap the President of the United States. No problem.<br/><br/>Director Jon Turteltaub's ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" takes a while to throttle into overdrive, and it is the story set up that is most captivating. ""Book of Secrets"" has one of the most complex writing credits involving The Wibberleys among at least 4 other writers. This kluge of writers wildly veers in story coherence; however, they context some of the most amazing facts from American history. Or at least I think they do. Then again this is an entertaining action movie, so pointing out this failing is rather pointless.<br/><br/>Personally the highlight of the movie was not the chase car scenes or the deadly balancing stone platform, rather the conversation between Gates and the awesome Bruce Greenwood as the President in the hidden tunnels of Mount Vernon. Cage and Greenwood are compelling and smart in their discussion of The Book of Secrets. And as my bud Peter pointed out, there is perhaps a clue leading to the movie's sequel. The rest of ""Book of Secrets"" is cookie cutter action albeit excellently executed. The acting is impeccable. Joining Oscar winners Cage and Voight is Helen Mirren as Professor Emily Appleton, who is Ben's mother. The scenes with Voight and Mirren are classic and amazing.<br/><br/>Returning in ""Book of Secrets"" are Diane Kruger as Abigail Chase and Justin Bartha as Riley Poole. Abigail (Chase) and Ben apparently did not live happily ever after since ""National Treasure"". We learn that Abigail has asked Ben to move out of their estate. Riley suffers an income tax debacle since obtaining his share of the last treasure. He has written a book of his exploits, but still remains in the shadow of big Ben. However, all band together to clear the Gates family name and determine the location of the mysterious City of Gold. Cage, Voight, Kruger, and Bartha are good here, but do not lend any insight or depth to their characters. Again, this may not have been a priority for this movie. Cage has the right balance of smart ass and hero that works. He does so with ease and humor. Jon Voight and Helen Mirren nearly steal the movie.<br/><br/>""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" will not win any award. However, it is a wild ride, very entertaining, and visually stunning. Yes, it is needlessly convoluted. Just enjoy the ride."

In other words, if  you're looking for something different, more clever, or intellectually  stimulating, read the Da Vinci Code again and don't bother with this  film.

"jaredmobarak","5","113","210","23 December 2007"," Oh look, a little golden manNational Treasure: Book of Secrets
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets will always be known as the film that prevented Helen Mirren from meeting Queen Elizabeth after the success of The Queen. I mean really, I would have made the same choice, because this film is truly high art. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first installment for its poor-man's Indiana Jones feel mixed with glossy effects and convoluted plot lines (Bruckheimerisms as I like to call them) and for the most part had fun with this one. Well that is until the discovery was complete, then the film just dragged on and on for what seemed like hours. This is a Disney film people, you know they will find the treasure and all will be well with the world. Therefore, all the intrigue and the discoveries to find the location of their desire, complete with massively annoying cross cuts between four different locales and ten different characters every five minutes, was totally subverted by the ending's adventure nonsense with no stakes because we all know how it would turn out. There were two things going for it though, I became real nostalgic for ""Legends of the Hidden Temple"" and found out that yes, Lyle Lovett is still alive.<br/><br/>I give director Jon Turteltaub and screenwriters The Wibberleys credit for coming up with some real interesting set pieces and situations for our adventurers to partake in. Weaving the Lincoln assassination with ancient Native American lore and United States historical mythology and rumor is quite a feat and it is successfully handled in my opinion. What goes wrong here is the whole mentality that sequels need to be bigger and better. The first film achieved a sort of balance with its amount of characters, but this one just goes too far. We have to now work in the President and our hero's mother, who just happens to be one of a handful of people that can decipher the language needed to complete their quest, not to mention throwing Harvey Keitel a bone by giving him five minutes of screen time just so we have continuity with a friendship from the previous story. Honestly, while I enjoyed National Treasure, I never asked for a part two, and I don't think too many people did. Unfortunately, however, it appears we will probably be seeing a part three in the future if the setup here means anything.<br/><br/>The movie is if nothing else a good time. I admit to being a big Nicolas Cage fan and enjoy his over-the-top shenanigansthey are in full force here and I loved the scene at Buckingham Palace that showcased them. Also, Justin Bartha is priceless as the hapless and under-appreciated partner. His expressions and one-liners really add a much-needed dimension here. The rest of the cast is adequate if very underused. There are a lot of familiar faces with thankless roles and many famous ones with little to do. Diane Kruger looks gorgeous as usual, but her role is more female in distress than really adding anything necessary to finding the treasure, unless you count watering rocks.<br/><br/>So, in the end, this film is going to be huge regardless of quality. If you liked the first, you will have a good time. It is not an Oscar winner or any Nobel Prize winning commentary, it's just a good old-fashioned mindless romp. As far as action/adventure goes, you could do much worse. With some great laughs and some really fascinating connections from history, you may actually learn something on the journey. Never preaching its intelligence, you are allowed to glean nuggets of truth at the same time as the characters that are still in the dark do. Fun is fun, and as far as that goes this one succeeds, despite the fact that it doesn't in any other cinematic category."
"DICK STEEL","8","117","223","18 December 2007"," A Nutshell Review: National Treasure: Book of Secrets
","If I may be able to conjure up conspiracy theories of my own, then I will attempt to hypothesis how National Treasure came about to debut on the big screen, based on opportunities which presented itself at the right time. First, the popularity of Dan Brown's controversial The Da Vinci Code, which was made into a movie of its own, but took a tad too long in doing so. Topping the bestseller charts around the world, it made Hollywood execs sit up and realize that wild goose chases and solving riddles and clues do make an interesting, workable formula. Coupled by the fact that the Indiana Jones trilogy (at the time) probably will not have another sequel see the light of day, then the onus is on crafting a tale based on controversies, with Indy Jones tendencies, and chances are a new winner will be born.<br/><br/>Hence, National Treasure in the year end of 2004, which made a decent dent in the box office, starring Nicolas Cage as an Indy like clone Benjamin Gates, embroiled in a mystery of the Templar's treasure, with sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) as the tech wizard necessary to assist him, while at the same time romancing Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), who joins his band of treasure seekers against her wishes. The Indy references don't just stop here, they extend to having a Henry Jones resemblance in Jon Voight as dad Patrick Gates. If you were to deck Cage in a fedora, whip and gun, the references will be just too blatant.<br/><br/>But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The important question is, is the sequel Book of Secrets as good as, or can be accredited with the rare accolade of being better than the original? Well, in all honesty it's still an entertaining ride, as this time we go around the world (OK, so perhaps just Paris and London), versus the original story being US-centric. However, like the first installment, the material, clues and riddles are still quite US history heavy, so if you're well versed with certain characters (brought to life early in the movie) or events (thanks to paying attention during history lessons), then yes, Book of Secrets will give you an additional boost in being able to identify with it. Otherwise, don't fret, as the casual movie goer with popcorn in hand will definitely not feel lost.<br/><br/>The narrative and plot still feel a little staged and rigged for convenience (and run time of course), as one event will inevitably lead to the next and to the inevitable ending (like how CSI solves crime within 45 minutes sans ads), but they're still a lot of fun watching how the characters go through the motion in believing that they're onto something really big. While the first had a lot of puzzles to solve, which kept some of us guessing and playing along as well, this time round the number of riddles have been reduced significantly, and signs of Mission: Impossible creeping in as our band of treasure hunters seek to perform the impossible, pertaining to levels of security guarding their mark.<br/><br/>In an excuse to make the sequel, we have Ben Gates and GATESENIOR reuniting to clear the good name of their ancestor, who's recently accused of being a co-conspirator, or even mastermind, behind the assassination of US President Abramham Lincoln. And of course, help comes in the form of Abigail, who's now estranged from Gates, trusty tech sidekick with the complementary witty lines Riley (and his red Ferarri), and now joined by Ben's mom Emily Appleton, played by Helen Mirren, who's in the movie to contrast her relationship with Patrick to that between Ben and Abigail.<br/><br/>However, we're not really interested in whimsical attempts to add depth to characters, are we? Sure they have their issues with one another, and with Ed Harris' Mitch Wilkinson being the token and very bland bad guy wanting to make his mark on history, the focus more often than not is to shift to the next big stunt / chase sequence. Like the first movie, one of the highlights touted in the trailer involves the art of balancing, which unfortunately, was already done in the first movie. Don't you just hate repeated stunts? And toward the end, I can't help but to compare it to Jackie Chan's The Myth, which in itself was somewhat of a treasure- hunter movie, involving the elixir of life (We're still stuck with gold here though).<br/><br/>And add to that Harvey Keitel's FBI agent Sadusky, the office of the most powerful man in the world, and teases from the Book of Secrets, we've got ourselves a handful being squeezed within 2 hours. Not to forget Nicolas Cage's absolutely horrendous haircut, the final verdict is that it's a fairly decent year end blockbuster which primed itself for yet another sequel, courtesy of page 47 of the titular book, if the box office numbers prove favourable."
"zardoz-13","3","19","30","25 December 2007"," ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is a lot of hush hush half-witted fluff!
","The first ""National Treasure"" (2004) movie qualified as a predictable potboiler that was fast, furious, frivolous fun. The sequel ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is just plain frivolous. Nicolas Cage heads up a seasoned cast, including Jon Voight, Ed Harris, Helen Mirren, Bruce Greenwood, and Harvey Keitel, that looks like they had a blast. If watching other folks have a heck of a lot of fun on the big-screen turns you on, then ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" will delight you. Unfortunately, ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" lacks virtually everything that good action-adventure movies boast. You won't find many suspenseful scenes that are realistic enough to make you squirm at the edge of your seat. Everything here resembles a carefully contrived amusement park thrill ride. When all is said and done, the heroes, villains, and sidekicks engage in an endless game of musical chairs. In fact, the entire movie looks like an episode taken from producer Jerry Bruckheimer's CBS-TV series ""The Amazing Race."" Basically, the principals scramble breathlessly across Europe, on a harebrained scavenger hunt for clues that bring them into contact with several famous places or high-ranking people, such as the President of the United States. Moreover, you know that nobody is going to get die or get seriously hurt, except perhaps the dastardly devious villain. Worse, you know a movie like ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is second-rate when the cartoon shown before it is more amusing than anything in this rated PG, 130 action-adventure comedy of errors. Right, the best thing about ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is the Walt Disney Studios' cartoon about Goofy and his arduous antics to assemble a high-definition television set within the confines of his modest home.<br/><br/>""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" should have been subtitled ""Books of Secrets."" Villainous Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris of ""Apollo 13"") uses a missing page from presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth's diary to implicate an ancestor of Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage of ""Next"") and his father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight of ""Heat"") as the mastermind behind the Lincoln's assassination. Naturally, our overgrown Hardy Boys heroes don't take kindly to Wilkinson's smear tactics. They embark on a race for clues that will clear their ancestor of this accusation. Some audiences, especially around these parts, may take offense at the way that ""National Treasure"" director Jon Turteltaub and scribes Cormac & Marianne Wibberley, try to rekindle the flames of Southern hatred with a plot gimmick that involves a secret Confederate society. Along the way, Ben breaks into restricted parts of Buckingham Palace with his estranged archivist girlfriend Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger of the first ""National Treasure"") and their computer savvy, comic-relief sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha of ""Failure to Launch"") so that they can ransack antique desks and then run rings around British security personnel. At another point, Ben and company make monkeys out of the U.S. Secret Service when our protagonist kidnaps the President (Bruce Greenwood, who played JFK in the Kevin Costner thriller ""Thirteen Days"") during a ceremony at George Washington's estate at Mount Vernon. Ben has to separate the President from his bodyguards long enough to learn the whereabouts of the Chief Executive's Book of Secrets. This apocryphal reference book about nation's paranoid secrets is concealed in the Library of Congress. Eventually, the trail takes Ben and company to the Black Hills of South Dakota and Mount Rushmore. Along the way, Ben's father Patrick has to reconcile with Ben's mother, his ex-wife, Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren of ""Prime Suspect"") who helps them decipher obscure Native American symbols. These reconciliations between Ben and Abigail as well as Patrick and Emily never generate much mirth.<br/><br/>""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" isn't half as good as its predecessor. Moreover, some of its scenes have been cloned from other recent movies. The backwards car chase in London looks suspiciously like the backwards car chase from the slightly better but just as objectionable The Da Vinci Code."" The writers took the dialogue almost word-for-word about those paranoid national secrets straight from another Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster, ""The Rock"" (1996) with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. The biggest set-piece occurs at the climax of the action with our heroes, heroine, sidekick, and villain atop an implausible giant spinning waffle iron contraption that looks like something out of the 1980 ""Flash Gordon"" extravaganza. What few historic facts and stories that come up in the plot could be found in the trivia section of any college textbooks, especially the phrase about mud. Altogether, if you're looking for lightweight, disposable fare to forget about the moment you hit the exit door, ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is superb. The first ""National Treasure"" movie coined over $347 million worldwide so it was inevitable that Bruckheimer would produce another installment."

","Okay- So I have a problem with the entire premise. First off- If you want a treasure to remain hidden, why give all the ""cryptic"" clues? Secondly, who left the clues anyway if no one remembered where the treasure is hence the hundreds of years to find it again?<br/><br/>Then - how come over the years clues were added, again, to a treasure no one knows the location of?<br/><br/>And how can you make a clue if you're not privy to the other clues or other stories and references that Gates (Cage) later somehow connected?<br/><br/>Lastly, you'd think there would be some decoy or false clues as well.<br/><br/>Since the Masons left clues in a bunch of old monuments, all you have to do is walk around and dig behind every Mason symbol you find with a pocket knife.<br/><br/>Now, for other problems: (oh, where to start?)<br/><br/>Okay - the chase scene - You have this ancient piece of wood clue and you trust a traffic cam to pick up a picture of it in high zoom-able resolution. I wouldn't. Then you expect the kid to hack right into their system.<br/><br/>Speaking of that, how the heck does this kid hack into the most secure systems in the world using a crappy Mac notebook and some wires taped to tiles?<br/><br/>How do they instantly get detailed schematics and blueprints to every building they need to get into? Why would they post those details somewhere on their sites anyway?<br/><br/>The Oval Office - again - one of the most secure locations on this planet and they get some White House flunky to take them in there- THEN - He doesn't think looking for an earring all around the room is ridiculous. You'd think she'd lost it earlier. How does a earring fly across the room and under a desk? Then the magic box desk - The flunky doesn't seem to hear all the locks and tumblers snapping up and down? Oh, that's right, because he was getting kissed by the girl which didn't seem to arouse any suspicion in itself (maybe something else though).<br/><br/>I won't even go into the Kidnap the President part - I was slapping my forehead at that point.<br/><br/>The clues - Geez - so vague but then Gates just steps away for a second and figures it all out correctly. I mean, you can look at anything a thousand different ways. How do you even know you had all the clues? Where is/was the chief clue keeper tracker anyway?<br/><br/>You can't make a sensible clue based treasure hunt without one.<br/><br/>Again- if all these people from different walks and times have clues to offer, then wouldn't that prove somebody or somebodies, knew where the treasure was? So why is it lost? <br/><br/>How did the kid fly that helicopter like that without looking half the time? Also, of course the copter had a high def camera on board as well. How did he get the helicopter in the first place? Wal-Mart in France? Yes, I know you have to go to a higher end R/C store than that. But still. Guess they took it on the plane with them.<br/><br/>How come the President can not only pardon all the federal offenses that occurred, they also didn't have to answer to any of the destruction they caused everywhere else either?<br/><br/>The last points are just for measure. I could have sat here all day but I didn't take notes while watching all the ridiculous ""plot"" pieces. There are too many to recall."

","I really liked the first movie with these characters but I got frustrated with this sequel. I was expecting much more intelligent puzzles and breathtaking adventure. Instead this movie is a perfect example of a sugarcoated adventure for family viewing in a lazy Saturday night in DVD in pijamas snacking microwave popcorn.<br/><br/>The plot is weak and far from plausible. There are the iconic characters (the smart hero and his love/hate girlfriend, the funny hero's assistant, the divorced hero's parents, the bad but not so bad guy, the good cop and so on). It's too much cliché for a single movie for allowing it to be a good one.<br/><br/>This definitely isn't a ""Top 10"" adventure movie. It's OK for viewing with the kids and just it."
"ironhorse_iv","7","5","6","4 July 2018"," It's no secret. National Treasure: Book of Secrets was not as good as the first movie. Regardless, it was still a fun watch.
","When it comes to unnecessary sequels. This film directed by Jon Turtetaub & produced by Jerry Bruckheimer takes the prize. It didn't really need to be made. Everybody in the original film, 2004's 'National Treasure' truly did lived happy ever after. At least, that was the climax of that Disney movie made it seems. However, I guess, that wasn't the case, as this sequel; has the crew of renowned treasure hunter Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) partake, yet another adventure. This time, in order to erase, Gate's family's ties of being a con-conspirator in President Lincoln's assassination. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, the action sequences were compelling. The conflict & drive, for those scenes seemed a little forced. Look, I can understand, some people ostracizing Ben if one of his immediate family members done something wrong, somewhat recently; but judging his character, over something, his ancestors did over 100 years ago, is really stretching it. It's like hating an innocent modern day American, because his or her family, once own slaves in the 19th century. They have no control on who, they would be related to. Even if, Gate's forefather was indeed one of the con-conspirators, I really doubt, most Americans would bat an eye to continue to hold a social stigma, against the family. If some, of them, did, at least, they would be somewhat understandable & sympatric; as there are plenty of examples of living descendants of notorious figures from the past, just trying to live life as patriotic Americans. One such example is, Edwin Booth, the real-life brother of assassin, John Wilkes Booth. He just continued to do his job, becoming one of the most famous Shakespearean actor of the 19th century, following Lincoln's assassination. He was so beloved by the public, he even befriended, Lincoln's son, Robert at a very early age. Likewise, most people would see, past tragic events, like that, as 'water under the bridge'. Surely, it wouldn't make any current generation of Gates seem anymore un-American. Nevertheless, I do understand, why Ben was driven by a fierce desire to clear their family name of infamy, even if it's highly unhealthy exaggerating behavior. The value of good reputation is characterized as something worth preserving, even going to great lengths to protect and honor. However, it's not something, worth risking, life & limb for, if the grumbles are from a bygone era. I find it, highly ridiculousness, that Gates, is willing to break multiply federal and international laws, just to prove long dead 19th century people wrong. Honestly, besides one out of place kid, it seems like the majority of people in the film, don't really care, that he was related to a co-conspirator, if they continue to invite him, into White House, Buckingham Palace, and other famous social events. People still acclaim him for his treasure hunting skills than anything else, during the course of this movie. His name isn't really cover in mud, as part of the film, make it out to be. Because of that, I find his action to be jarring. Like really, what was his goal, anyways? How does finding a long lost city of gold absolve his forbearer from the crimes, he was accuse of? The movie made the quest seem a bit too vague, but if it's my guess, it seem like the crew bribe the government with enough gold, that, the federals look away or cover up theirs past crimes. If anything, Gates & his crew seem more like the villain than the heroes. Their willingness to lie, manipulate, assume false identities and trespass is bit troublesome. Nevertheless, moviegoers will surely, just be tempted to dismiss their actions completely because they were made in the service of an honorable end-and because the Gates family didn't intend to mean no harm. Still, I found their good nature request to be somewhat morally flawed. After all, it could had easily been resolved, in more quiet way, but I guess, we wouldn't have a movie if it was that simple. Regardless of that, the crew is mostly still mostly likeable. I just didn't like the subplot romantic argumentum elements that came with most of them. I found it, highly annoying. Still, most of the performers did fine work here, even new comers, like Ed Harris as the antagonist, Mitch Wilkinson. The villain was a huge improvement from the first movie. At least, Mitch was murky & creepy. Still, his heel to face turn in the climax was really jarring. The only flaw in what was otherwise, a compelling ending. Along with that, the music by composer, Trevor Rabin really adds to the suspense of that sequence. I love how the puzzles & heist elements wasn't as predictable. You really didn't know the twist & turns, the clues would led. It made the film a little more fun. This movie prove that smart, entertaining live action, adventure PG films, are still possible, even without a lot of harsh language, violence, & sex appeal to prompt people to take an interest in history. Still, it is necessary to suspend your disbelief at times, as nobody should take this movie as a legit American History lecture. After all, it is an action adventure film that claims that France & Britain knew about a Mesoamerican City of Gold in South Dakota for years & still gave up, those lands to the United States for cheap in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase. Despite the imperfections with real-life history & its many plot-holes. I do have to say, the movie was compelling enough to look past its flaws. It really got you, into the sense of treasure hunting. Hopefully, a third installment will one day, come to fruition. Overall: With 4th of July celebrations, just around the corner, as of this writing. This is one sequel worth watching on Independence Day. It was a blast."

","This movie was pathetic. I'm glad I only used my Christmas gift cards to see it and not my own money. Let me set the stage for you: The theater was pretty packed for a New Year's day 8:00 p.m. showing. The audience was in a good mood to start. I could feel the energy with the laughter coming from the Goofy cartoon that preceded this dreck of a film. The group synergy was great and it lasted until about half-way through the film. Once we all realized what a complete waste of time and money this movie was, we immediately stopped laughing at Justin Bartha's quips and started laughing at Diane Kruger's acting... which was far more humorous. Seriously, the only thing she was good for was that scene in the oval office where she was wearing that skimpy little dress. The movie was full of lousy punch-lines delivered by an even lousier combined effort from some A-list actors. Based on the first National Treasure movie, I didn't expect this to be a masterpiece in cinematic eloquence, but I did expect the likes of Voight, Mirren, Keitel and Harris to give a little more than this. Harris' performance was particularly awful mainly because of the complexity of the way his character was written. First, he's a shrewd southern business man who wants nothing more than to find this city of gold. Then, he turns into somewhat of a hero and sacrifices himself. WTF?!? Then he says ""All I wanted to do was find the city and help you to clear your name."" That's ALL HE WANTED?!? Again, WTF?!? This coming from the same character who said no more than two scenes prior ""Well, if I'm not going last then I might as well go first,"" when it came to a perilous situation. Uhhh, ookkaaayyyy. Mirren's performance wasn't all that bad. Her character was poorly introduced and her first scene when arguing with Voight's character was pretty hard to swallow. Keitel's performance was okay as well, but I think that is only because he didn't have enough time on screen for the writers to screw it up too. Honestly, the movie as a whole was not worth the time. It was so far fetched that it really just became incredibly unbelievable in every way. Government agencies infiltrated at the ease of entering a Wal-Mart, International government Web sites hacked like they were a link from Google. The Secret Service as inept as a group of security guards at a Foghat concert. This was just lame. Poorly written, poorly acted and a poor choice on my behalf. Should've known better."

","National Treasure: Book of Secrets was hypnotic. The acting was so shockingly bad, the premise so totally unreal and the dialog so childlike that I found myself in some sort of trance trying to make sense of the noises coming forth out of the actors mouths.<br/><br/>First this movie pretends to be about something, which I find insulting. It is not actually about anything, it is a sequence of plot devices meant to sell apple computers. <br/><br/>Second, this movie did not have any characters in it. It was as if great actors had been repeatedly struck in the head and forced at gunpoint to say lines that were being made up on the spot by an 8 year old. The dialog just runs together in one long strip with seemingly no attention paid to who should logically be talking. <br/><br/>The actors often repeat the same phrase two or three times in one line. ""It's over there, the secret book, over there where it is."" This is both surreal and confusing.<br/><br/>The only reason to see a movie of this caliber is either big explosions, or some form of nudity. This film had neither. It had neither because it was one of the worst movies ever made. It's movies like these that make you wonder where the millions of dollars spent making this sort of painful trash could have gone. Feeding children, building low income housing, providing health care. So much could have been done, but instead the world has another soul blackening B movie that cost more money than I'll ever have in my entire life.<br/><br/>National Treasure: Book of Secrets made me want to cry."

","I loved the first movie but this sequel simply *missed* the motivational villain. But what can you expect when everyone in this sequel when the main characters are suppose to be 'rich', except for Riley of course. I quote my husband as to ""why are they having a car chase in London?"" I simply answered...""I don't know."" At least the villain in the first National Treasure tried to figure out clues and paid people to give up letters to a puzzle, this villain simply leaned back and let Gates do everything for him. Which admittedly was not as appealing as to wondering if he would figure out the clue before Gates did. The motivation of the villain simply wasn't all that plausible. I mean come on, I'm sure if he'd approached Gates as a fellow treasure hunter to look for Gates would have helped him. So the villain was unimpressive.<br/><br/>And then there was the BS story about Ciablo(sp). Whoever wrote that piece of lore needs to take a lesson in geography and Native American tribal relations. How did the Queen of England know about some vital abstract part of a Native American folklore when they couldn't even read the symbols on the planks?! Then there was the total disregard for a 'national treasure' at the end as the 'scientists' started to dismantle Native American artifacts as if studying them onsite isn't an acceptable practice. BS!

","Well that was poor Now don't get me wrong, the first National Treasure was silly but enjoyable and had at least a decent thread of a plot running through it, therefore imagine my disappointment when I put the sequel in my DVD player.<br/><br/>Dear oh dear, an utterly astonishingly awful sequel of which all the major players should be thoroughly ashamed of even being remotely connected with, heaven only knows what the talents of Helen Mirren, Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight were doing in this dire pile of poo.<br/><br/>Yes it is watchable but that is only because it is so bad that it is utterly laughable, indeed it has been a good few years since I enjoyed a movie because it was so utterly awful. The plot holes (a tenuous description since there was very little plot to have holes in really) were so huge you could drive a bus (or in this case a beer lorry) right through them.<br/><br/>Feel free to sit back and laugh at the inane nonsense of it all as we flash from Washington DC to Paris, then London (cue what should have been an excellent car chase through central London that was very disappointing not to mention geographically impossible!) back to Washington DC and then a few other places by which time I was either losing the will to live or just didn't care anymore until I was asked to believe that a lake had magically been installed at the top of Mount Rushmore so that it provided access to a South American hidden city of Gold.<br/><br/>What a load of cobblers.<br/><br/>As the team carried on in search of the most elusive treasure of all (that would be a decent script I presume as they were desperately in need of one) there was also the horrific sight of the mysterious 'Page 47' which sadly opens the door for the inevitable Disney dash for cash that sends us on a collision course towards a second sequel.<br/><br/>I think I will give that a miss somehow"
"blue_leader2004","2","7","10","19 January 2008"," a complete waste of time
","Well, in a nutshell, this movie is not worth a penny, or your time. I could not believe that such lousy acting, such lack of any logic (except the logic known just to story writer) and such a waste of otherwise good actors would be possible, but it was, nevertheless. The premise of the story is boring, the execution and script is boring, the actors (notable exceptions here are Harvey Keitel and Ed Harris) are acting without any drive or inspiration... just awful. If you want movie entertainment, go watch something else. How can anyone believe there is a city of gold located there? How could the President act like he did in the movie? Such blatant attempt to make the President look noble and friendly is straight lousy, and of course impossible. No one with common sense would fall for that one. I honestly do not know why such good actors like Ed Harris, Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight have accepted this movie. First movie was entertaining, and contained some good moments. Here, my feeling is that all actors wanted to get it over with as soon as possible and run away as far as they can. Of course, in a typical American way, the brand new (and good) cars are wrecked for the movie, it has to be a Mercedes, or some other car of value. Such a waste...<br/><br/>Avoid at all costs."

There must be some absolutely stonking smaller budget films coming out nursed by the cast, because that's the only way I can see the great actors in this film agreeing to this piece of crap.<br/><br/>Now, in my time, I've read quite a lot of pseudo-revisionist history. And while the first National Treasure was plausible to the fringes of freaky history, riding a Da Vinci Code wave, this stretched my ability to suspend my disbelief to breaking point. Gone are the ""you're going to do what?!"" chortling surprises of the first film, which wasn't a fab film in itself. Now even a wide-eyed rube like myself sat there saying ""this is ludicrous"" and I'm glad I got to see it on my cinema pass, because if I'd paid full whack I would be disappointed.<br/><br/>I know, I know, you're asking why did you go and see it in the first place? Well I'd heard bad reviews about it and couldn't believe it would be this bad. I was wrong."
"filmbuff20","7","13","22","20 December 2007"," Utterly enjoyable blockbuster with a sprinkling of entertaining nonsense.
","A sequel is something that is never needed, unless continuing a specific story arc, so a sequel to 2004's National Treasure is without a doubt an unnecessary venture. Basically, this film is a take it or leave it kind of entertainment, though if you enjoyed the original, this one won't disappoint.<br/><br/>Picking up a few years after the events of National Treasure, we find Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) living with his father (Jon Voight) after being booted out of his own house by girlfriend Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) has written a book that no-one wants to read and has had his beloved Ferrari towed. Life is hard for our characters, but you can be sure that a new treasure hunt will take place sometime in the next two hours to give them a new equilibrium to look forward to.<br/><br/>From the rousing opening scene depicting the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, we are thrown into a non-stop whirlwind of globe trotting and treasure seeking. We find out that a man named Wilkinson (Ed Harris) is in possession of a lost page from the diary of John Wilkes Booth which suggests Thomas Gates' involvement in the conspiracy. Thomas Gates is great, great grandfather to Benjamin Gates so naturally Gates will do anything to clear his family name.<br/><br/>There are quite a few familiar faces from the first film in this second outing, right down to Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight, and all seem to be having a great deal of fun with this enjoyable nonsense. Cage is at his crazy best, be it running from rival treasure hunters or staging a hilarious argument with his ex girlfriend in the middle of Buckingham Palace, he's unrestrained and is allowed to go wild which is exactly the kind of thing this movie needs. It saved Ghost Rider from being anything less than diverting, anyway. Justin Bartha's return as the wisecracking sidekick, still cracking wise, is either annoying or charming, depending which way you lean. Diane Kruger is still beautiful and has great timing, the only thing that really elevates her from her eye-candy position. Helen Mirren also makes an appearance here in a role that she didn't really need, but she looks like she's enjoying herself anyhow. She serves simply to squabble with Jon Voight as Cage squabbles with Kruger, which doesn't amount to anything more than a few extra comedic elements. Ed Harris plays a carbon copy of Sean Bean's role in the original, which in itself was a cardboard cutout bad guy role. It's not essential for the antagonist to be particularly formidable in these movies, sneering will do, but Harris' supposed ambiguity is a real weak point in the script. It's a waste considering Harris has experience in this area, what with The Rock and A History of Violence under his belt, but here he doesn't manage to be a particularly memorable or well drawn character.<br/><br/>It feels like the two films were made back to back. The energy is still the same, all the actors seem like they never took a break, right down to the musical score, shooting style and Cage's toupeé. If it ain't broke, don't fix. It's maybe not as tight as the first film, allowing a little flab to get in, mainly towards the middle and again during the finale, but it doesn't last very long and soon we're back in full flow again. The outcome of the clues is of course preposterous and on too large a scale to simply dismiss, the contrivance of the treasure resting place too familiar, but this at least doesn't diminish the overall fun of the flick.<br/><br/>Of the two treasure hunting movies to come off the back of Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code, National Treasure was always the more fun, beating the other movie hands down, even though it was directed by Ron Howard and actually was The Da Vinci Code. This second instalment doesn't want to do anything more than the same and, against all the odds, they churned out a crowd pleasing thrill ride of pure entertainment. It's a tad smarter, funnier and more endearing than the average blockbuster (especially when looking back at 2007) and the action, while by the numbers, doesn't disappoint either. For a fun night out, it's a sure thing, if almost instantly forgettable. If this movie does well, a loose end in the plot promises yet another sequel. Do we need it? No. Will it be as good? Probably not. Will we see it? Quite possibly, because we never learn."

I have never really liked Nicholas Cage, but he does just fine in this movie. Helen Mirren is fun to see, and the story is very fun and enthralling. There is not much I could really say about the movie, for I have not seen it too many times, and it is a hard film to review without giving too much excitement away. It really is a lot faster, slicker and enjoyable than the first, and as a movie itself it is pretty darn good and well made. I also do not typically enjoy action movies, so that is a nice compliment coming from me. See it if you are interested in anyway."

","It's been a very long time since I saw the below average original, and I have been craving a good and fun adventure. Obviously, I was thinking they stepped up the game to the surprise hit, first movie, but, alas, 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' was a lot worse. Every time I wanted to like this silly, SILLY movie, my mouth kept dropping and it simply got more preposterous. And I'm not just referring to the plot. They made a dumbed-down kid version of 'Indiana Jones' and yes, even younger than 'Young Indiana Jones,' so you really have to be prepared for the simplest versions of espionage, dialogue okay for a preschool play and a storyline even Dora the Explorer would turn her nose at. Sadly, it's not a standalone movie; they expected you to remember every character and relationship from the first one as they give almost zero background. This was a problem for me since it's been years since I saw #1. That said, apparently Benny (played by Cage – who now ranks as one of the worst actors of all time, his one shinning grace was 'Leaving Las Vegas' and I think he should have left Hollywood as well) is upset because his great-great-whatever relative might have been involved in the assassination of President Lincoln and Benny will stop at nothing to clear his name! Including kidnapping the President! A very forgiving President, of course. ""Oh, well, if you're trying to clear a dead man's name, I can see why it's justified in committing a felony."" I'm really looking in too deep into this globetrotting and predictable ""adventure,"" but I was disappointed in that you don't have to G-rate down all the gags, acting, dialogue and sooo-secret twists to have a great movie (see: Indy 1 & 3.)"

","So, here I am, Astonished at how amazing Jerry managed to direct an amazing movie like this one; how Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger, Bartha, Voight, and Harris, act this one out, into a somehow very terrific movie, funny but tense, and yet, very entertaining, just like the first one.<br/><br/>National Treasure: Book of Secrets, talk about how Ben Gates try to prove that his ancestor's (Thomas Gates), is not the mastermind behind Lincoln's assassination.<br/><br/>And just like the first one, it's still filled with laughable, serious, and patriotic sense. Very very enjoyable.<br/><br/>Despite the fact, whether this book exist or not, it's still a very interesting thing to think about. But, don't overdo the thinking, since that can ruin the fun in this movie, and make you guys (the thinker) to question the purpose and whether it's the truth or not. And the next step would be, ""It's the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. Nothing makes sense"" thought, and that will definitely ruin your excitement bout this movie, and hence, make your rating against this movie, goes down. Why bother about something that we don't know if it really exist or not, and even if it does exist, what business do you have with it? Hope my point is as clear as crystal clear.<br/><br/>So, here is my suggestion. Just enjoy the movie. Don't over think about whether it's the truth or not. Just watch how Ben solve the puzzle, and how they mastermind things, and along the way, laugh at Riley's ""pure thought"". You'll find it much more interesting that way than if you try to think too hard.<br/><br/>I personally rate this movie 10/10."

","I had seen the previous National Treasure with my mom and actually enjoyed it. I only went to see this one because she wanted me to go with her. The trailer for this one looked really lame. I had pretty low expectations going in, and my feelings were right on the money. At times this movie felt so contrived and boring. At one point my mom even fell asleep. This is par for the course for Nic Cage movies nowadays. He used to be so amazing in the Face/Off days. He needs to get back to the basics and choose only quality scripts.<br/><br/>This movie was basically predictable overly scripted adventure. Not even the Lara Croft variety, which was quality and tolerable. It was so transparent that they were going for the whole Indiana Jones vibe. All they added was more modern special effects.<br/><br/>My overall issue was the contrived plot and the BAD acting. I mean does Cage even care anymore? Does he just do it for the $20 Million payday? Does he no longer have honor in his craft? This movie was painful to watch at times. I really wanted to get up and walk out.<br/><br/>I mean Ben (Nic Cage) just happens to know how and when to get answers at every turn. Must be nice. The movie failed to follow the main character in his struggle. At one point there was this big car chase scene in downtown London. The viewer has to really suspend disbelief for that one. No cops in sight and seemingly no traffic. Must be nice again. Anyone who has been to London knows how crazy the traffic jams and narrow streets are there. How lucky for Ben, there is a traffic camera to take a photo of the artifact, and by the way, his hack guy friend is a wiz who can hack into the computer and download the picture. Next, Ben gets into the Oval Office and goes on to kidnap the president. Ben is like Jack Bauer on crack and with the ultimate connections. The movie just starts to JUMP SO MANY SHARKS. The villain is (Ed Harris) really lame and for the most part useless. Again, I can't believe that Ed Harris would attach his name to such a bootleg project. His role had no real substance or point. Take him out and the movie would still be the same. That's not good.<br/><br/>The movie just had a bad plot/script. The GMC - Goal, Motivation, Conflict of the hero (Nic Cage) is just awful. Clearing the name of his great grandfather at the expense of all else? Give me a break...<br/><br/>I wouldn't spend theater money on this one. Just wait for Netflix, and even then only if you are DESPERATE. But, you might actually be BORED watching this. Skip it altogether."

","They tagline for this film could've been 'National Treasure 2  This time it's personal' considering it revolves around the Gates family named being accused of a dark history. But then again, they must've realised 'National Treasure 2  This time it's personal' just sounds silly. Wait a minute, something to do with a National Treasure film deemed 'too silly'? Well, I never. Truth is, National Treasure: Book of Secrets is so bad that with about twenty minutes to go you just have to accept the garbage being churned out to you and hope it will all soon be over. The film isn't painful in the sense there is nothing to read into nor is it a disaster in the sense the film fails from scene one and doesn't let up alá Batman & Robin or Thunderbirds but it still grates and grates in its own way.<br/><br/>In fact with the National Treasure films, I am quickly developing another natural hatred of a Disney franchise; a hatred that began in the Summer of 2006 when I saw the first Pirates of the Caribbean film and quickly cottoned onto the masses of followers who just seem too brainwashed by the actors, pacing and 'fun' the films offer to even notice how crap it was. Then there was this, National Treasure: Book of Secrets. Nicolas Cage is back as Ben Gates but as I said, this time it's personal because his family name has been shamed and accused as a conspirer to President Lincoln's death. His adventure to clear the name and to find the truth will see him travel to the Oval Office in the White House; the Queen's desk in Buckingham Palace and it will see him meet and greet the current American President in search for what separates fact from fiction. I can only guess that these scenes are supposed to act as some sort of dramatic series of events in location's we very rarely see in films. I can say that not only are they unspectacular but they are also contrived and anticlimactic  you mean to tell me that in the Queen of England's desk there was a secret code hidden all this time? What about the President's desk? There was something in there the entire time and nobody found it? Suspending disbelief has never been so necessary.<br/><br/>But along this time to help him is his old buddy Riley (Bartha) and his girlfriend Abigail (Kruger); both characters serve their silly purpose as they did in the first film. Riley is un-funny comic relief (people keep mistaking him for Gates and he cannot sell his book. Also, his car is towed  how hilarious) and Abigail is the pretty to look at, innocent, 'Eurotrash' girl who does what she's supposed to do and says what she's supposed to say while kissing and 'exposing' herself at timed intervals when she has to. But it's not just these two that are along for the ride because this time, Ben has brought the folks. John Voight is back as the father in an attempt to try and resurrect a career that had flagged since Mission: Impossible and Helen Mirren is the Brit typically cast as the intellectual of the bunch, playing Ben's mother. A big problem with these characters is that they do not exist to be developed; they exist for mere comic relief that is never funny. Emily (Mirren) and Patrick's (Voight) bickering runs parallel with Ben and Abigail's falling out and it is the common-denominator in treasure hunting that threatens to bring them all back together again as a happy family.<br/><br/>So the adventure sees them propelled through Paris complete with funny looking French policemen who show up on bicycles (yes, proper push bikes) and act in an oblivious manner; it sees them propelled to London during which I actually took offence to Cage's impression of an Englishman as he rolls out the accent and the clichés before outsmarting the British police who are equally inept. The journey will see them visit a White House ball during which Gates will succeed in a ludicrous plan to get the President in a location one-on-one before the film finally has the gang getting very wet in an underground cavern accessible only by randomly pouring water on the rocks outside.<br/><br/>The film is a failure with its narrative that is loose and uneven and its characters that exist to meekly attempt to make us laugh. An example of the loose plotting is evident in the element of the book. It is a book that only the president knows of and yet the idea to look for this book is spawned from Riley's novel. How does Riley know of the book in the first place if it's only passed on from President to President? The domestic situation between Ben's parents is silly and unneeded and the payoff to their relationship is equally anti-climatic. Ed Harris lacks any sort of charisma or menace to play a good villain in this film and his scenes just while away into acts of nothingness. The films wants to think that Abigail kissing the white house official in the Oval Office just as Ben finds what he needs is 'funny' and the characters in general rely too much on technology to see them home; scenes like the button that 'pops the trunk' and the overuse of computers and phones are examples. The product placement of Fullers London Pride, Mercedes Benz and especially Apple Computers is shameful as is the feeling you'll get at the end of the film when you realise you just sat through it."
"vasaro-1","5","6","9","4 January 2008"," Fun, but overly contrived; a waste of acting ability & locations
","What was the magic of National Treasure 1? It was the sense of discovery with the pressure of a time-line in which to solve complex puzzles having interesting connections in history, all the while having the ""bad guys"" attempting to do the same.<br/><br/>That element is lost is NT2, and this film goes the way of Tomb Raider 2 by having the the good guys team up with the bad guys to solve the puzzle by forcing them to cooperate, but never with any real sense of a threat. This type of plot tool is very weak.<br/><br/>The movie also wastes too much time in character development of Ben's mother and father which adds very little light humor, but serves to burn screen time and bog the film down rather than propel it. They should focus more on the verbal sparring between Ben and his tech buddy, Riley, which does more for humor in the film. Diane Kruger (Abigail) seems to be there for eye candy in this film, not really contributing much to the plot like she had in NT1 by hampering Ben's progress or threatening to take flight with clues Ben needed.<br/><br/>NT2 seems to move ""too fluidly, too quickly."" The director simply wants to rush the viewer from location to location, seemingly for the sake of showing Ben in different locations as in NT1, but Ben solves puzzles so efficiently at lightening speed in NT2 that there's never the feeling as in NT1 of struggling over a conundrum. Ben seems to make historical connections so effortlessly that you're never on the edge of your seat, nor are the viewers ever given time to ponder the puzzles themselves. With the ""bad guys"" teamed up with Ben, there's no sense of urgency. The antagonist isn't going to shoot so-and-so by such-and-such time, so why are we being rushed to the next filming location? It'd be nice if Ben and his crew DIDN'T get a clue right for once and then they generated some humor from that.<br/><br/>Turteltaub needs to watch ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" again to understand character motivation. The main character is driven with purpose of action for well-defined and valid reasons. In ""Raiders"" it's because Indiana doesn't want the bad guys to have possession/control of the Ark which could give the Nazis a powerful advantage during WW II. It's almost the same reason in the 3rd film--the Nazis want the Holy Grail which would tip the balance of power in their favor. All the while in both films, the lives of characters close to Indiana are put in peril. National Treasure 1 had similar character motivation. National Treasure 2 did not.<br/><br/>Turteltaub, if you're reading this (hah! yeah, right), and considering a plot device for National Treasure 3 (based on page 47 of the book of secrets), then you should consider using the same plot device as Indiana Jones #3: Indiana Jones' father was missing (causing Indiana to act), then his father was shot (causing him to act to find the grail); place one of Ben's family members (Abigail as Ben's wife?) in mortal danger, forcing Ben to solve puzzles on a compressed time-line. It works all the time for the hit TV series, ""24."" Bottom line: NT2 is a fun, mostly fast-paced ride from location/country to location, and if you set your brain on auto-pilot it's enjoyable. Hopefully NT3 will have the same suspense and wonder as NT1."
"Lechuguilla","Null","12","22","27 May 2008"," In Search Of El Dorado
","Finding the lost city of El Dorado, or Quivira, or Cibola (take your pick) would be easier than finding any plausibility in this film. Our hero Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) goes from one narrow escape to another, as he zooms to Paris, then to London, then to the White House in Washington (with a personal chitchat with the President no less), and then on to Mount Rushmore, in search of, well, in search of ... something. I think he's looking for evidence to clear his family name, in the historical conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln. What he actually finds, with superhuman luck, is something else, something he didn't expect to find. But none of it really matters. The plot here is so wildly unbelievable, so far-fetched, and so muddled as to be a cinematic magic carpet ride.<br/><br/>Clearly, ""National Treasure: Book Of Secrets"" is aimed at kids. It's a highly visual movie, with lots of eye-popping outdoor color images. The physical action is so fast at times, with lots of high speed editing, that there is no danger that the audience will be required to do any thinking. Acting and dialogue are largely irrelevant. And the film has elaborate and expensive production design.<br/><br/>Not all of the conflict is physical. Ben must negotiate with his partner Riley (Justin Bartha), his dad (Jon Voight), his mom (Helen Mirren), and a couple of others, all of whom become involved in Ben's quest. The film has a clever twist, but if you're not paying close attention, it's easy to miss.<br/><br/>There is no sex, nor is there any prohibitive violence here; it's a Disney-type adventure all the way. Still, if the film can get kids interested in history, whether it's the legend of El Dorado or Lincoln's assassination, then I suppose ""National Treasure: Book Of Secrets"" can be said to have some redeeming value, it's plot implausibility notwithstanding."
"bob the moo","Null","18","36","17 February 2008"," Bland, mass-produced rubbish that nobody seems to have put any heart into making
","Normally I would write a plot summary before I review a film - it helps introduce the film in case anyone is reading but mostly I do it because it helps me focus my mind on what I have just seen. However to summarise National Treasure 2 it is probably easiest just to take two dice and for one die assign each number the name of a person in history (Queen Victoria, Nixon, Custer), then for the other assign an object (a table, the Empire State Building, a book). Now simply roll the two dice and make notes of the combinations - Custer's rifle, the President's watch, the Queen's bedroom etc etc. After a couple of rolls you will have as much of a story as this film and indeed may have produced a more interesting one.<br/><br/>If you haven't got it yet, I thought the plot was utter nonsense that seemed to have had scenarios imagined up and then threaded together with the barest or logic (or none in many cases). Some of the scenes where Cage works out the clues had me laughing and one imagines that the writers made more use of shoe-horns than they did pens and paper. My personal favourite lack of logical is where a major clue is thrown out a car window to stop the bad guys chasing them and all our heroes have to look at is a photo taken of the clue by a speed camera that they drive past. What? Weirdly though, the plot is not the sole problem with the film and indeed it could have been covered for if everything else had worked in regards delivery. As it is though, it seems that there is no heart or energy in the film and that churning out another product to appease the Disney shareholders was top of the reasons for making it. This shows in every regard. It shows in the very bland ""look"" to the film. It is clear that lots of money has been spent on the sets and general design of the film but yet none of it feels like more than a set and certainly none of it really convinces as the real thing. This feel continues into the action sequences which again are bland. If the film had genuinely had excitement or thrills then the plot holes become less important but the rubbish action just leaves everything sitting out there exposed to the cold light of day. A gutless car chase through London only serves to highlight how awesome all those Bourne chases were and, by return, how pathetic this one is.<br/><br/>And then we have the incidental music, which tends to be one of two type - both equally misjudged and annoying. The first is the ""earnest swelling sense of importance"" music that accompanies any discussion of the treasure-hunt, family ancestors or patriotism. It invites you to think that what you are watching is important, which made me think that the composer dialled it in because he cannot have watched this and thought this approach would work with this material. The other type is the ""jaunty, quirky, isn't-this-comical"" music that fills the rest of the film. This music invites you to be amused but again it only manages to highlight just how unfunny and clunky all the ""lighter"" moments are.<br/><br/>The cast list surprised me because if you simply read out the names of those involved I would not have guessed that they were all have been key people in a film this poor. I suppose in a way it is like the rest of the film - clearly there has been money spent but no actual heart or effort is to be found. Cage demonstrates no range or indication that he cares about the material and he makes for a dull hero; his performance is the same when jumping from a crumbling platform and when giving a lecture - it is sad to see someone care so little about what they are doing. Bartha is a weak comic sidekick but at least he appears to be trying. Kruger is as pretty as she is pointless and generally just seemed to be in the way. Harris has a good presence and at least brings a bit of menace to the film while managing to hide his embarrassment, but this is below him and he knows it. Voight is rubbish and Mirren should genuinely be ashamed by a weak performance in a role she took simply to cash in on Oscar and make some good money. Keitel I assume was a bigger character in the first film because other than that there appears to be no reason for him smirking his way around the edges.<br/><br/>Overall then, this is a lot of nonsense but, more telling, it is bland and disinterested in the viewer. The plot holes and total lack of logic do treat the viewer with contempt but this could have been covered if I had even once been engaged or enthralled by the film. As it was though it never feels like a film made for any other reason than making money. The cast don't seem to care, the direction is flat, the action is poor and the pace is poor. The fact that it is two hours long only makes it worse as it does not even have the good grace to be short. It is rare I hate a film but I found this poor to the point of being insulting because it is not like it tries but just misfires but rather than it is poor simply because it could not be bothered to even try."
"sportsbvh","9","15","29","21 December 2007"," Lives up to its predecessor
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets was very good. It was not as good as the first one, but does not completely fail.<br/><br/>Plot: 13/15 The crew sets out to look for the City of Gold. Following clue after clue,(may be too complicated for kids), taking them to France, England, the White House, and Mount Rushmore, they also encounter their fair share of problems. The part I really didn't like (*spoiler*) was when they actually found the treasure. It was almost anti-climactic. Of course, they're happy that they found it, but they're also in a race to not drown. They didn't exactly ""relish in their victory."" <br/><br/>Villain: 14/15 Ed Harris was very good. He didn't overdo his character and played the part well. The villain was very similar to Ian from the previous film. He's always right on their tail, finding the clues they don't have, and playing with their minds. In the end, (*spoiler*) we find out that he's not exactly a villain, but just a guys that wants some respect for his family name. He wants to be part of history.<br/><br/>Comedy: 10/10. Like in the last movie, Riley delivers most of the brilliant one-liners, often hilarious. There were several laugh-out loud funny parts, such as Jon Voight and Helen Mirren swinging on a rope like Tarzan and Jane.<br/><br/>Action: 10/10. There was plenty of this. Everything a car chase on the streets of London (worthy of being in a Bourne film) to the depths of Mount Rushmore, plenty of action went on.<br/><br/>Romance: 7/10. Not too much of this (obviously, you don't really need too much for this kind of movie). But the romance that was involved was almost cheesy. (*spoiler*) In the beginning of the film we learn the Abigail and Ben have separated, though if you pay attention, you find out that if they hadn't split, the filmmakers would have lost a crucial plot point. Also, we see Ben's mother and father kiss start to come together towards the end. Even though they kiss, at the end we don't learn exactly if they get together again, which left me disappointed.<br/><br/>Music: 14/15 Most of the same music was used, thought not as much. This left me slightly disappointed considering the music from the last movie was phenomenal.<br/><br/>Characters and their development: 15/15 We knew most of the characters already, and they were very entertaining to watch. New characters: Wilkinson and Appleton (the villain and Ben's mom) The villain (as mentioned above)was great. Ben's mom is a lovely character. We learn, very obviously, that she hates her ex and cares about her son very much. She's very fun to watch.<br/><br/>Was it worth the ten dollars I spent and two hours of my day? Yes (10/10) Overall: 93/100- 9/10 Very good! (Note: there is also kind of a set-up for a third movie. I could be completely wrong about this but I got that impression)"

","What a boatload of pure, unadulterated hogwash. Shame on Helen Mirren, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, and Ed Harris for being in this piece of absolutely Bush-Patriot-I'm An Amurrican Hero riddled crap. From Nicholas Cage I would never expect more, he is one of the world's lousiest actors anyway... I mean, have you ever wondered how come a piece of firewood seems to have more emotional range and depth? No spoilers here, none needed. This movie should be avoided at all costs, except if you are trapped on an airplane or possibly in prison or some other confined space with no other choice available to you... In my case, I was held hostage by a German woman I know and forced to see the dubbed version of this piece of utter detritus. I can tell you, dear reader, that having only shortly before-hand been subjected to the sheer agony that is Alvin and the Chipmunks by my nieces, 12 and 8, on a visit to the U.S. over Christmas, that piece of sheer crap was a million times better and ultimately more deserving of every prize that could be thrown at it than National Treasure: The Book of Secrets, especially if you see it dubbed in German. There is no greater ""treat"" (other than possibly being forced to eat dog excrement for dinner?) than hearing lines which must have been unbearably bad in English come out of the single-emotion, no-talent lips of Nick Cage as Ben Gates. And I pity poor Riley Poole for having accepted a terrible role as sidekick to an idiot in this ultimately boring, totally predictable piece of rotgut which plays to all that patriotic crap which has been rammed down the throats of Americans (and thus the world) since the 9/11 attacks on New York in the name of ""patriotism"" by the fascist Bush regime."
"usayshonuff","1","14","29","30 December 2007"," Wait until it is on late night cable...and absolutely nothing else is on
","This is my first ever comment on a movie. Most movies I leave alone after viewing, so others can make an honest opinion for themselves. I would have to say that I have a very high tolerance for movies, but this one had me writhing in my seat in agony.<br/><br/>This movie goes astray from the very beginning when they try to make the main plot for the film in that the Gates family name is tarnished by the new accusal of his great grandfather's participation in the assassination of President Lincoln some 142 years ago. Well even if great grandpops was involved, WHO CARES. The reality is that this plot was so weak that not even 1/2 way into the flick it switches gears and goes a totally different direction. That was a good idea, but not good for viewers. The story then takes them to improbable locations to get clues that there is no way in hell they would ever be able to get to in the capacity that the did. Whatever...it's Hollywood, i let slide. THe thing i couldn't let slide is the way they find the keys to problems they run into. This is where the writers spent the least amount of time. They realized that in order for the movie to flow, they couldn't waste lots of time explaining how the problems were solved. The problem with this is that for the audience, there is absolutely no buildup or suspense moments from the sluething (just ask McGuyver). In my eyes, it is these non-action moments of revelation that can glue entire films together, and when the glue is of poor quality it ALL FALLS APART. <br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this film, that I would just bore you (and myself) with all the details. This is one of the few films that I wanted to walk out of (x4), but I stuck it out to the very very very bitter end. My recommendation is to save your hard earned money for a real movie, maybe a movie with an original script.<br/><br/>Thank you for listening."
"messedupcarrot","4","6","10","5 January 2008"," A decent movie.......when you don't have to pay $11 to see it.
","I didn't see the first one, but I have a great idea of went down. The profits made from the first movie went towards keeping Harvey Keitel in the movie, getting Helen Mirren to appear, and whatever was left over was used to pay for the villain, and they only had enough to afford Ed Harris. As part of her deal, Helen Mirren probably managed to get the producers the Buckingham Palace set from ""The Queen"" while the actor who played the President probably brought with him the Oval Office set from ""13 Days"", in which he also played a President, though not a fictional one (he was Kennedy in 13 days). The characterization is well done and Cage, Voight, and the rest do great jobs portraying their nuanced characters, and the plot is a lengthy and intricate ordeal but it's simply a bit too ridiculous. The movie isn't terrible, but is often contrived, clichéd, and painful to watch. The light-hearted attempts at humour were terrifyingly weak. In one scene Nicholas Cage and his sidekick are trying to find a hidden code on the Paris Statue of Liberty when suddenly two Parisian Gendarmarie(police) accost them. Cage then proceeds to distract them by putting on a cliché French accent and talking about how he knows who Montesquieu was. Suddenly, the police are so overtaken by Cage's knowledge of the French philosopher's existence that they decide to let him carry on and even help translate the clue they eventually discover. I learned about Montesquieu in 8th grade history, so based on the logic of this movie I know more than enough about philosophers (especially after taking that stupid Baruch Intro to Philosophy class) to get out of DWI or even murder in any country in Europe. The movie is good if you have nothing, and quite literally nothing, to do. If you enjoy watching Ed Harris shift in and out of his cliché Southern accent and utter stilted lines like ""please excuse me for the lateness of the hour,"" (is that supposed to be a gentlemanly, Southern way of apologizing for showing up after 11:30?) then by all means go for it. Otherwise wait for a rainy day when it comes on cable."

"nolarobert","8","9","17","21 December 2007"," A Thrilling Winter Ride
","My wife and I were able to attend a sneak preview offered by Disney at our local AMC Theater. The theater was packed thanks to the local radio station giveaway of passes. I enjoyed the first movie but it wasn't on my Top 100 movie list for great films. It was what it was, a fun, ahistorical excuse to put Nicholas Cage in the middle of an Indiana Jones-esquire adventure. It entertained but had the substance of cotton candy, as once I was out of the theater the movie left my memory. So I went into this screening of Book of Secrets with middling expectations. I will have to admit the writers did a good job of constructing a cool story to serve as the catalyst to send Nick ""Ben Gates"" Cage and his posse on an adventure worth the space in my memory.<br/><br/>I am sure the story has been summarized well already. So I am cutting to the chase (or chases) in what I found appealing in this film. Ed Harris as the bad guy worked as I found Ed's character to be sufficiently creepy as the pseudo-Blackwater chief ""Mitch Wilkinson."" He could have been the cookie-cutter foil but the writers added a nice twist at the end of the story that redeems Wilkinson and raises his character above the stock movie nemesis. Helen Mirren was a delight as Ben's Mom who happened to be an expert in dead languages. Mirren and Voight had good chemistry as a long-separated couple who could have benefited from marriage counseling all those years ago.<br/><br/>Yet what I enjoyed the most was the interplay within the triad, Ben Gates, his ersatz ex Abigail Chase and the everyman hero, Riley Poole. They played off each other as if they had known each other for years. Cage as Gates, pulls off the insufferable but lovable ex so well that you buy into the plot line that has the lovely and sharp Diane Kruger, as Abigail Chase, fall in love with Gates all over again. This could slide into treacle without the valuable contribution of Justin Bartha as the long-suffering, unacknowledged action hero, Riley Poole. His humor was always timely and never forced. It was also gratifying to see that he did get the girl and the car in the end.<br/><br/>Am I the only one who thought that Bruce Greenwood brought a Kennedyesque air about his portrayal of ""The President."" Maybe it was due to his excellent work as JFK in ""Thirteen Days,"" but he actually convinced me we could have a President who was intelligent and well-spoken. Also, he has me curious as to what was in the Presidents' book and how that will be played out in ""National Treasure III: Page 47."" So I hope they invite him back to join Gates in the next installment.<br/><br/>So if you loved the first movie, you won't be disappointed in the Book of Secrets. It is a better, more coherent film that the first one with a great cast that worked well together. What more could you ask for in an adventure film released in December rather than summer!"

"mjones1972","6","5","8","22 December 2007"," Entertaining, if completely preposterous
","The Book of Secrets is entertaining more for the Indiana Jones-style booby traps and the amusing bickering between Gates' estranged parents than the lackluster plot. The concept of a villain is seriously underdone. The bad guys are willing to shoot people and wreak havoc on the streets of London to get what they want, but towards the end the villain agrees to self-sacrifice as long as he ""gets credit"" for the find? Please. Any personality so motivated by greed would have forced more of a confrontation than we see here - a Lara Croft or James Bond sort of duel is in order.<br/><br/>I realize that conspiracy theories are the ""in"" plot line lately, and they do provide an intriguing element beyond any special effects or the supernatural. But the Book of Secrets poses other believability problems than just whether the viewer accepts the idea of secret inscriptions on the Statue of Liberty or coded writings in a Civil War diary. For example, the Secret Service would not allow an uninvited Gates walking past them at the dinner party just because he's dressed like a waiter - Secret Service screen everybody in attendance at such events. Similarly, sneaking into Buckingham Palace was amusing, but it would not be as simple as depicted. Hidden tablets in desks locked by ancient tumblers and a book concealed by the presidents in the Library of Congress were interesting, but far-fetched. Top it all of with a few Indiana Jones-style devices such as rock carvings that one turns to open secret doors and a lever that one pulls to reveal a tunnel in a boulder, and we have the makings of a completely preposterous story. While entertaining, I never forgot I was watching a movie."

This second film has more in common with a salt-water game fish, caught on a hook on the end of a line, before it jumps into vision because it flounders, just below the surface. The opening 20 minutes of this film, holds a great deal of excitement and promise but that falls flat, for a movie played for laughs, rather than intrigue and true detective work. This film lead the countries top box office take for two weeks running, only on the fame of National Treasure 1. There is nothing to get excited about, nor is there any anticipation of ""the chase!"" as there was in the first film. Director Jon Turteltaub may take the blame for this really terrible film, only because he accepted the position as Director. The actors played their parts well enough but to make a great film, one has to have a great script. National Treasure 2 died from a lack of a good screenplay!

This film features: a) Very poor acting, unbelievable and pathetic b) A sorry excuse of a conspiracy theory -- you have templars and everything else that goes along.

","We attended the first show, opening day in our small home town theater (Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville, TN), to a nearly sold out show.<br/><br/>This adventure is not as fun this time around. The clues are less entrenched in symbology , lending less story, and more room for comical relief. That was a mistake, in my opinion; one which may prove to hurt it in the long run. Considering, however, how dismally the Golden Compass has fared, xmas movie goers are hungry for a good fantasy/actioner to sink their collective teeth into.<br/><br/>Hopefully, some of those disappointed fans who brave the rains and windy wet cold to see NT2 will also give the Golden Compass a try, while they're at it. NT2 contains the same base formula as NT1, but this time it is far m ore watered down, with much less clues and less real action, but more development of the interpersonal relationships between Ben Gates (Nic Cage) and his parents (Helen Mirren and Jon Voight) and his lady. We also get a deeper look into the personal life (or lack thereof) of Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), Gates' Partner.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, due to a lessening of action and effects accompanying the deepening of character development and an almost total lack of substance, many will not think highly of this work. I, however, found it entertaining. Not as entertaining as the first, but it was still an enjoyable venture.<br/><br/>Cage seems more comfortable in this incarnation of the character, without contributing a dialed-in performance. His comfort conveys an on-screen presence; a great charisma above and beyond the usual, and that's saying something.<br/><br/>The premise has promise, but is not explored to its potential enough to flesh out the screenplay to actually give it a story. Unfortunately, this attempt fell far short in comparison to the rich story detail of the first. It left us wondering if there will be a third, for we are hoping for a return to a real adventure with a well-developed story as the first installment led us to expect.<br/><br/>All in all? It's fun, but lacks the quality of the previous chapter. Here's hoping the 47th Page leads us back to a GOOD adventure.<br/><br/>It rates a 5.2/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

I did this because the ""hunt"" in that movie was entertaining with a few glimpse or originality here and there which made parts of it interesting.<br/><br/>The problem is, NT was already built on a borrowed concept, standing on the shoulders of The DaVinci Code it knew it had an audience and admirably tried to include more action and free it from religion. Voila, you got National Treasure.<br/><br/>Now you got a hit on your hands and you know you have to milk it and it better be fast because it wasn't THAT big of a hit, people might not remember it in say, 4 years. I then imagine you split up the workload for the script of the movie like this: 1 guy thinks of funny clues, 1 guy thinks of some extra background story for the characters and the dialogue they have George Lucas write, because let's face it, he's cheap.<br/><br/>Finally you put all 3 into the same Word document and you send it straight to production because damn it, it's milking time. The director probably asks for a few re-writes before the studio says ""that's it, go with it"". I'm not sure if he tries to salvage the script in any way because as it's apparent to us, the acting in this movie is non-existing. Finally the thing get's edited and every scene gets as much dialogue and story cut out because of how awful it is.<br/><br/>Seriously, those of you saying Jon Voigt or Helen Mirren do a good job in this movie, come on. They are both known as serious good actors and that's why people try to justify parts of this movie by accentuating them but the truth is they showed up, slept through it and got paid.

I am not surprised another one is in the making at all but with this on being based on such a thin story I can't see how the 3rd one can avoid complete disaster.

","Note to Hollywood: Stop making sequels, especially if the original was not that great to begin with. The only sequel that has, so far, been decent, was Shrek 2, but that's another review. This sequel to the first movie was so ludicrous, well, where to begin? At least with the first movie, most of what happened was plausible. But in this sequel it would be hard-pressed for a 6-year old to buy into the fact that someone could break into Buckingham Palace, let alone into the Queen's private office, AND get into the Oval Office without a troop of Secret Service personnel everywhere. Then there's the issue of why The Bad Guy (played by Ed Harris, and unfortunately not convincingly) was now presenting evidence of a conspiracy, but the FBI never went after that angle. Yea, he wanted Ben Gates (Cage) to lead him to the treasure, but why not do that sooner, since the Gates character had been around looking for treasure for years? What we have here is an almost duplicate of the first movie, virtually line by line, with the added character of the mom (Mirren, who is miscast, but at least gives us something to look forward to), and Cage with a bad haircut and color job. That there is a 3rd in the making... Let's hope that in the 3rd installment that Cage gets a better barber."

","I kind of liked the first installment of National Treasure. It was nothing more but enjoyable escapism; sort of an Indiana Jones for kids.<br/><br/>But in this sequel it feels like we've seen it all before. For the life of me, I can't understand why they kept Riley Poole as the comic relief side kick. That character is just plain Jar-Jar-Binks-terrible. I suppose that his plethora of lines are supposed to be witty, but they just made me want to stab him in the neck with a No. 2 pencil. In all fairness, the overall dialogue sucks and blows at the same time, which I thought was a physical impossibility.<br/><br/>But my issues with Poole aside, the main problem with this film I had with this film is that I felt it didn't have a strong enough ""hook"". Honestly, I couldn't care less if Nicolas Cage's great-grandfather (or whatever the hell it was) is accused of being complicit in a murder committed about 150 years ago, and they have to find a secret something in order to clear his name. Now I sort of understand why George Lucas said that the long gap between Indy 3 & 4 was due to the fact that they couldn't find a strong enough McGuffin around which the story revolves.<br/><br/>I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this movie."

","I condemn this film, not because it is bad, but because it is lazy. Producers Turteltaub and Bruckheimer both have experience of big(pirates) and low budget(cool runnings) success.But here they switch to remote control, and the overwhelming feeling is of a film that was created to generate a paycheck, and no more.<br/><br/>The film is rotten at the core, who cares whether Ben and Patrick Gates (played by Nic Cage and Jon Voight)ancestor was implicated in the murder of Abraham Lincoln? And without that the film loses all dramatic impetus. London? Black cabs, double decker red buses,Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, red post boxes...........yawn, it really is as predictable as that.<br/><br/>The plot is preposterous, and helen Mirren looks as though she would have been better employed looking for a decent script rather than trotting out the banal dross she has to speak.The two hour running time is desperately short of both decent action and witty script, instead we have to trudge through a formula so clunky that you find yourself screaming for an on screen mechanic to give it some oil.<br/><br/>Of course the set pieces are fine, and the stars do their bit - but no more.Avoid unless you are pretty desperate for something to do."

","I really wish i could have given this movie more stars...<br/><br/>What the main problem turned out to be, at least for me, was the fact that it just kinda jumped in. it was near a carbon copy of it's predecessor.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, it was an enjoyable movie that had many laugh out loud scenes. and it also did include a bit of masonic tradition as did it's aforementioned predecessor (i almost choked on my popcorn when the mentioned albert pike...).<br/><br/>However what it had an abundance of puzzles... it lacked in character development.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, i am not looking for serious character development in a film such as this, that would be stupid. but in many cases it almost seemed as if this was an alternate version of the first one.<br/><br/>One thing that kinda annoyed me was Ed Harris' antagonist character. he made no sense. now i know and understand the need for bad guy/ good guy conflict in a Disney film. however, harris' character just made no sense, and was really useless to the over all story.<br/><br/>In one breathe he literally went from bad guy, to sorry about all this now he's a good guy, to bad guy, to just misunderstood and whiny.<br/><br/>At least with Sean Bean's character in the last film you knew where you stood with the guy...<br/><br/>All things aside, it was a decent film. My wife and I, including my bestest friend in the whole world next to my wife, enjoyed it.<br/><br/>And while it was nearly a carbon copy duplicate of the original, and it did fall short of the original, it was worth seeing in theatres. Perhaps had the story been a bit more solid, and the bad guy being at the very least consistent, and the dialogue not seemed like dialogue that was left on the cutting floor from the first one, i would have given it more.<br/><br/>And i probably will buy it when it comes on DVD, not because i have the need to keep collections and buy it just because it is a sequel, but because i did enjoy enough to want to watch it again."

","Treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates looks to discover the truth behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, by uncovering the mystery within the 18 pages missing from assassin John Wilkes Booth's diary, after learning out that his great-grandfather could've been involved in the assassination. Can Ben clear his family's name? Or will his family be linked to the murder of Abraham Lincoln?<br/><br/>One thing I was annoyed about this film, along with several other Disney films, is that the MPAA are afraid to rate Disney movies a PG-13 rating. Yes, National Treasure 2 could've been a very fun popcorn movie, and it is, but the film is filled with too many immature jokes to make kids laugh. The Pirates film can't be Disney's only PG-13 films.<br/><br/>Apart from that, I found this film pretty entertaining. When I started to watch this, I was dreading it. The actors TRY to be funny that they aren't. I was thinking, ""What are they doing here? Seriously."" I didn't try to enjoy it like the first movie. I was thinking about the wasted talents from the cast but then it grew on me. I started to ""go along with the ride"" and enjoyed it after about the 30 minute mark.<br/><br/>No, I wouldn't say it was as entertaining as the first and in my opinion, the first film is one of the best fun and energetic adventure films I've ever seen. Along with the first, this film did a great job not boring you for about just 2 hours long. This film will keep you entertained.<br/><br/>Everyone in here seem to have a pretty good time making this film, along with having a good time acting on screen, including a newbie, Hellen Mirren. However, I really do not like the clichéd use of having divorced couples in a sequel film after the protagonist falls in love with his/her lover in the first.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film is bigger but not necessarily better than the first film. The action and visuals are better, I must say. Although it feels like the first movie all over again (you can't help but sense a deja vu that is happening while watching this film), this film does a well job keeping you entertained from beginning to end."

","Having seen the first movie, I couldn't wait to see this follow-up. What followed was sadly nowhere near as good as the first...it's certainly easy to watch without too much effort but the storyline is not only obvious but feels rushed and at points, so ridiculous it spoils the feel of the movie. The similarities between certain scenes in the first movie and this one was also a bit too much, leaving this feeling like a bad copy with very little effort having gone into it. Helen Mirren was a good addition - shame we couldn't have seen more of her in the movie, she may have rescued some of the typically over dramatic, American scenes and brought a well needed sense of British dry humour into it! An easy film to watch but nothing to get excited over."

","When a film has canned music, it better be good if it wants to overcome it. A surprisingly good find this year, or in any year, is ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets."" Canned style music always implies a better film than the filmmakers delivered, but this time the pic lives up to the almost impossible climaxes in the score.<br/><br/>The thing with this one is the actors, and the characters they play. That's always the way it should be, but is, rarely ever, any more. I could see how this simple script was made to sing with the right actors and direction. And the script isn't so simple, after a prologue sucks you in with a missing page from John Wilkes Booth's diary, wittingly produced to start the film on its merry way. And by the end you will laughingly go along, full tilt, with the notion that Mount Rushmore was a cover-up (I won't tell you why).<br/><br/>Next comes the camera work, exposed so it compliments the story, not get in the way of it. The operation and the choice of camera angle, simple pans when they are called for (hello, you need a reason to pan folks), and especially lens choice is done without flare, but in a documentary style that makes Spielberg actually look amateur by comparison. The editing then is absolutely superb, but, look what he had to work with.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage I like in this, his sidekicks make a trio of sleuths that charm the pants off you, the girl being achingly beautiful without realizing it. And Helen Mirren and Jon Voight make good dysfunctional parents (these are two of the best actors we have ever had), never breaking character no matter what business they are asked to perform. Ed Harris channels a villain out for redemption. Harvey Keitel does a job as the clichéd FBI agent with style.<br/><br/>Like I said, the music is the weak link, but it doesn't ruin the film, just gives it a schmaltzy import that the humor in the story can play against.<br/><br/>I don't recommend many films these days. I saw ""The Great Debaters"" and highly recommend that as well, but ""National Treasure"" is artful escapism at its very very best."

Pointless outlining the roundabout manner in which the Mayan City becomes his goal, suffice to say the clues involve McGuffin piled on McGuffin piled on Abe Lincoln's assassination with Ed Harrison top like a cherry.<br/><br/>Harris is villain Wilkinson, who also seeks the City for his own reasons. It is a thankless role, for he imbues the obvious ""villain"" with many layers. His motivations are not evil, though his actions are, and there is always doubt on how far he is willing to go for his ""noble"" cause. It is a subtly shaded character that all villainous actors can learn from.<br/><br/>All the principal cast return, Jon Voight as Ben's dad, Justin Bartha as Riley (given a little more to do this time round than just whine), Diane Kruger as Ben's girl and Helen Mirren (three times older than Diane Kruger and twice as sexy) as Voight's estranged wife, for feisty comedic arguing. Even Harvey Keitel returns, to mill aimlessly on a professional basis.<br/><br/>Written by The Wibberlys (which sound like a couple of furry things from another planet) and once again directed by Jon Turteltaub, BOOK OF SECRETS takes our intrepid adventurers to Paris (where - so it says in the Foreign Director's Handbook - the Eiffel Tower must be in every shot), to London, to the White House and into the Oval Office itself, to the revelation that ""Mount Rushmore is a cover-up..."" <br/><br/>Nic Cage gets his Gom Jabbar moment when he puts his hand blindly into a rock orifice; the cast gets to tramp around blindly in labyrinthine passageways, but the coolest sequence by far is a Mayan death trap - a gigantic, tottering square slab that they must all balance, using each other's weight as counterbalances.<br/><br/>The Book of Secrets is supposedly a Presidential tome - a captain's log, if you will - of all the nation's secrets tabulated by presidents for presidents, covering Area 51, the Kennedy assassination, the moon landing, etc. Movie plays it like a gag (with Bruce Greenwood as Pres) but we all know there are secrets that only one president may pass onto the next, maybe not in an all-encompassing book, but surely in documentation which, if exposed, would lead to impeachment, jail or worse.<br/><br/>When Candy Crowley of CNN asked newly-inaugurated President Obama in 2009 whether he had seen anything in his new job that had ""given him pause,"" he simply shot that gleaming smile at her and refused to comment.

The plot is really interesting and how it goes from clearing his fathers name to finding the lost city of gold is quite clever as well and the overall ending of where the city was found was absolutely great. I felt that this movie was how the 4th Indiana Jones movie should have been in some aspects since the city of gold was a city of gold etc.. and there were no aliens.

However, he is extremely convincing as an insensitive ""ugly American"" who abuses the hospitality of every country he visits. The storyline could have been more interesting than even ""The Da Vinci Code"" ... if it made the slightest bit of sense and if the director had not simplified it to its barest, more unsatisfying elements. All it boils down to in the end is a very uninvolving video game, which is the rule of most action pics these days. The hero wants to prove his ancestor is innocent of having conspired against Lincoln's life. That is his primary motivation. Yet, it is never shown how he actually achieves this. The business about the twin desks is full of holes and Helen Mirren's false decoding - under duress - of the second wooden plank just doesn't make sense and is never satisfactorily resolved. The most interested viewers are left dangling left and right and in more dire danger of losing their mind than any of the protagonists tumbling down an underground river. The City of Gold is disappointing and simply unattractive. It actually feels like recycled footage from the first film. And the music score represents the umpteenth rehash of the theme from ""The Madwoman of Chaillot"" (penned by Michael J. Lewis, 1968). Oh! And the main character pronounces the word ""repartee"" as if it was written ""repartay"", which is an infallible proof of ignorance and lack of culture, even in an American.

But I actually not only thought it wasn't bad, it was actually a really good movie, I was impressed.

I know that's a silly complaint, but sometimes he just seems so out of place in a film, especially with his recent movies.

","**WARNING!! CONTAINS Spoilers** National Treasure 2 was supposed to be this big blockbuster that everyone just *had* to see. Unfortunately, I fell into that trap and paid my 9 dollars to go and see it, shortly after it was released. I must say that I was extremely disappointed. This movie was half as good as the first National Treasure, and was borderline annoying.<br/><br/>I was very frustrated with two key points of the movie. One, it was VERY corny. They tried too hard to shove the Riley character down our throats. Too many times you heard the few chuckles throughout the theatre as Riley cracked another lame joke. The scene with the eagle while they were at Mt. Rushmore was ridiculous. Riley is a cool character, and he is definitely needed in the film, but it was very obvious that the directors were aiming at a younger, and immature audience.<br/><br/>Secondly, I was upset about how terribly unrealistic it was. Now, before I go any further, I do admit that I know that these types of movies are always going to have things in them that make you wonder about how realistic it is. I mean, the whole point of the movie series is finding huge treasures, by following clues left behind from historical figures, and family members in the past! There has to be some parts that are a big stretch. I get that. However, some movies can overdo it, and this one certainly did.<br/><br/>Searching for a City of Gold that is hidden in Mt. Rushmore?? Come on! That was a pretty ridiculous idea. However, what's worse is how they found the treasure. Having to break into Buckingham Palace, and the Oval Office, with no problems? Sure, that happens everyday! I mean, seriously, how silly is it that three people could just walk into two of the most heavily guarded places in the world, and steal clues that they needed? *sigh* Very frustrating. I also think that they made Riley's abilities with electronics way too strong. He hacked into every possible network that Ben Gates needed, including getting Ben and Abigail out of jail, within minutes.<br/><br/>OK, enough about how terribly unrealistic the movie was. I could go on and on. The fact of the matter is that this movie is OK if you just want to go out and have a nice night, or watch a nice adventure movie with the kids. However, NT2 is much worse than the first flick in the series. I would give it a 5 out of 10, only because the action is good, and there were some cool historical parts.

A question I have, is what happened between the first and second films, there's a lot there left to the imagination. <br/><br/>Hopefully, one day, before Nicolas Cage is too old, they'll finally do a third film and answer some questions we have. The casting for National Treasure 2 was good, I really enjoyed Bruce Greenwood as the President. And the story involving the Lincoln conspiracy was very thought provoking.

"hitchcockthelegend","8","1","1","25 August 2013"," Joyous boys own yarn full of the serial silliness of movies past, present and the first movie!
","As with the enormously successful first film, this sequel irritated as many people as it entertained. It's just the nature of the family friendly blockbuster, that some film fans refuse to accept them as viable fun family fare, whilst others can easily run with it and have a great time. The highbrow versus the lowbrow? Well maybe if you want to really be speaky arty about it...<br/><br/>National Treasure: Book of Secrets made over $450 million at the worldwide box offices. Now we are told that financial success is no marker for quality of product, that's fair enough, but what is undeniably true is that it means there were considerably ""a lot"" of happy paying punters! From way back in the day when we had the likes of Gunga Din, Beau Geste and The Adventures of Robin Hood, there has been a considerable market for the action adventure movie. Some are better than others, some are even more brainy, but mostly they deliver a set pattern of what many people want.<br/><br/>The makers of this sequel just go bigger than the first film whilst following exactly the same formula. Nicolas Cage's treasure hunting Benjamin Franklin Gates has to follow clues to treasure again, only this time it's to clear his family name since his granddaddy has been implicated in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Justin Bartha and Diane Kruger are again along for the ride, while Jon Voight gets more screen time as Daddy Gates. Helen Mirren joins the fray as the estranged Mommy Gates, Ed Harris slots in for villain duties and Bruce Greenwood adds class as the president of the USA.<br/><br/>The stunts and set-pieces are humongous, the traps and clues more elaborate than before and the photography (Amir Mokri and John Schwartzman) once again is gorgeous. It hurtles along at a nifty pace, stopping only to explain the various plot machinations to younger viewers, and the comic by-play between all the principal players is set in stone. Is it full of implausibilities, insulting history and credulity stretching beyond belief? Yes! Of course, that's why many of us action adventure fans escape into such high energy nonsense. Those expecting cerebral tickles or those offended by basic family blockbusters should quite simply stay away. 7.5/10"
"bkoganbing","5","1","1","1 January 2011"," Cibola
","Conspiracy theorists will love National Treasure: The Book Of Secrets because it will give one plausible reason to affirm all the paranoid things one already believes in and add a few more. Imagine the fabled Cibola, City of Gold, which several conquistadors spent lots of time and money searching for, being positively real and the clues being in Buckingham Palace and the White House? Does it get more conspiratorial than that?<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha, Jon Voight, and Harvey Keitel all repeat their roles from the first National Treasure. Because part of the riddle is in some Indian language symbols, the intrepid treasure hunters have to call in Voight's estranged wife and Cage's mother Helen Mirren. That raises all kinds of issues not related to treasure hunting.<br/><br/>Ed Harris is the villain here, he starts the ball rolling by claiming to have an authentic missing page of John Wilkes Booth's diary which implicates Voight and Cage's ancestor in the Lincoln assassination. Of course Harris has an ulterior motive in doing that, to get the treasure hunters working because their historical knowledge is greater than his. In the end however he proves not to be as big a villain as the group from the first National Treasure and that's quite a let down.<br/><br/>As for Cibola, let's just say that the government has put quite the marker on the site.<br/><br/>If you're a history lover or a conspiracy theorist this film will grab your attention. But it's not up to the standard of the first one."
"forrestwrs","2","1","1","13 September 2010"," Nothing Is Too Insulting To Our Intelligence
","National Treasure 2 is a carbon copy of the first movie with a couple of new actors sprinkled in there. First of all, I could not even by into this movie. The premise behind the first movie was ""Let's go find the largest treasure in our nation's history!"" The premise behind this movie was ""Let's go find the *second* largest treasure in our nation's history!"" I had a hard enough time swallowing the plot of the first movie. This movie's plot went beyond silly and landed in the territory of stupid.<br/><br/>There's just too many ridiculous plot points that the filmmakers were trying to make us swallow in this one. The characters gave the same dull performances in this movie as they did in the last movie. The difference is that not even Jon Voight or Justin Bartha really put in a lot of effort this time.<br/><br/>And where as I found the screenplay in the last movie to be one of the better portions of the movie, here it was just absurd and astonishingly bad. Everything was pretty predictable and the screenplay never stopped throwing bullshit at the audience. ""Ben's relatives helped assassinate a president! You don't care? You should! And all of the presidents kept a diary of everything they did in office! That could have been helpful to historians? Well, it wasn't!"" Nope, nothing is too insulting to our intelligence evidently! The worst part of this movie is the action, or the random running and screaming and chasing the movie tries to pass off as action. It was a degenerating factor in the first movie, and the same applies here.<br/><br/>Whereas I had been forced to watch the first movie in my high school history classes (because the movie mentioned history I guess?), I got the opportunity to see this picture in theatres (they took us on a field trip to see it because, I suppose, there are some historical figures mentioned at some point, right? I got nothing...). One of the worst theatre experiences I have had. It's loud, it's corny, it's cheesy, it's stupid, it's a mess, and it's incredibly bogus action for an ""action"" movie. I put the word ""action"" in quotes because i really couldn't buy this as an action movie in any sense of the word.<br/><br/>2/10"

Not every confederate could even afford a slave let alone shoes they just wanted to create their own country.

The confederates deeply hated the north union because they destroyed their homes and done atrocities.

It leads to all sorts of locations, like Bunckingham palace, the oval office, and Mount Rushmore.<br/><br/>All the acting is top-notch, Justin Bartha is hilarious. Nick Cage is funny and a good action star. So why do a lot of people not like this. It has a very low rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and the basic consensus is ""A talented cast goes to waste in the improbable National Treasure: Book of Secrets, which is eerily similar to the first film."" Oh sure, its improbable, yeah because critically acclaimed films like Avatar, Harry Potter, District 9, The Dark Knight, and Jaws are all incredibly realistic.

The plot rushes from here to there, a little too much so, and there are plot holes as big as the Grand Canyon. Also, Cage seems a bit long in the tooth for such nonsense. But hey, it's a kid's movie! The only question is, will a kid be willing to sit through the whole thing? The director and writers take no chances, by the way, and give us much the same death-defying finale as that in the first movie. Hey! It's a kid's movie! Keep telling yourself that. Helen Mirren plays cage's mom and Bruce Greenwood is the president, and they give this silly but likable film some badly needed dignity."

I enjoyed the purported links to factual evidence as in the links to civil war heroes and villains, the twin desks, one at buck house and the other in the oval office.

"Boba_Fett1138","6","1","1","5 July 2008"," It serves its purpose well enough.
","I've seen the first movie ""National Treasure"" but I basically remember nothing about at it, so it really didn't made a lasting impression. I'm sure that in a couple of months from now I will have forgotten all about this movie as well, since its entertaining and all but also all pretty forgettable.<br/><br/>The movie serves its purpose to entertain and you'll probably won't be bored while watching this movie but the movie also really isn't anything to spectacular. Both 'National Treasure' movies were expense blockbuster, of well over $100.000.000 (this movie actually cost about $130,000,000), which sort of makes me wonder what all that money gets spend on these days. 10 years ago every $100.000.000 would had easily been amongst the top 10 of most expensive movies ever made, now days $100.000.000 will only give you movies such as ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"". It really doesn't look or feel as an over $100.000.000 production.<br/><br/>For that amount of money some more fireworks could be expected. Basically ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" doesn't feature anything big or exceptional, which we haven't seen in any other movies before. The first movie was basically more or less a simpler version of ""The Da Vinci Code"", while this movie tends to lean more toward the Indiana Jones movies, with a sniff of James Bond to it. So seriously nothing too original or new here, which is of course mostly due to the movie its script and storytelling.<br/><br/>The script is simple, though yet of course not very likely. Sure, it's fun to treasure hunt and look for clues all over the world, on famous landmarks but not when basically every 5 minutes the movie is set at a different location (probaly also partly explains the movie its high budget) and we're looking for a new and different clue. This is just the kind of storytelling that does not ever work out very well. Basically the movie tries to achieve too much and a too short amount of time.<br/><br/>But no, I wouldn't call this movie horrible or anything. It's still professionally made, though not with a lot of imagination. Perhaps it's time for Jon Turteltaub to pass on the directing honers to a new and different director for the third movie of the series, which is currently in its early production stages. It also obviously wouldn't hurt to hunt down a better script this time. But oh well, I at least I wasn't bored while watching this movie and therefor I can't really regard this movie as a weak one, since it obviously served its purpose to bring entertainment.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage seems to enjoy his role in these movies, which shows on the screen and he is well cast in his role. His acting is right for the part, though probably not a lot of people will agree with this, or at least they won't admit that they do. Most of the characters and actors from the first movie return again in this one (Justin Bartha, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight), which is probably due to the fun it must be to make these sort of movies or perhaps just because of the fat paychecks. It also explains why actors such as Helen Mirren, Ed Harris and Harvey Keitel appeared in this sequel. They are just not the type of actors to normally appear in a big summer blockbuster. Nevertheless they of course are a welcome addition, though their characters aren't the most interesting ones and some roles even feel a bit redundant for the overall movie.<br/><br/>Nothing too remarkable, just some decent entertainment.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Gone are many of the puzzles, and a cohesive plot. We have a bad guy (Ed Harris) who switches between wanting to kill the heroes, and saving their lives, within scenes.

It's still got much of the same charm and characteristics of the first movie. If you liked the first one, you'll more than likely like this one too, but it probably won't be as good as you hope.<br/><br/>The movie suffers mostly from a lack good script consistency. However due to the success of this movie, and other things that happen within this film, there is a potential set up for another National Treasure.

But wish directors kept geography accurate - should not have put lake by Mt. Rushmore. Didn't like totally misleading history with Mayan-like symbols as clues to location of gold in South Dakota, of all places! Adults will enjoy these few hours of light entertainment more if they consider the movie a spoof of first National Treasure ( and that might even be considered by some as a spoof of all treasure hunting movies).

","First of all, I really liked the first NT film. At first, I thought it was because I just had such low expectations, but I watched it again recently and it holds up very well. But, this is about the sequel. Unfortunately, I DID have high expectations for NT2, but it has none of the panache that the first movie possessed. Even in the first film, the plot stretches credulity, but in this pile of dreck, there's almost no coherent plot in the first place. They make an attempt to weave a complex plot out of some weak connections, but only succeed in producing a confusing jumble of ""puzzles"" that anyone could figure out in a few minutes. With this lack of plot line, it's no wonder that the motivations of the characters are similarly murky. Subplots are set up and toppled for no apparent reason, and the Ed Harris character is particularly schizoid, which is a shame because he's such a good supporting actor. Unfortunately, his talents were almost entirely wasted in this film. In fact, wasting excellent actors' efforts seems to be the primary purpose of NT2. Justin Bartha (Riley) is consistently witty and funny, just as he was in the first film, but he seems a little strained or forced at times in the sequel. Nicholas Cage actually improves on his performance in the first film. He's much less wooden and seems more relaxed and natural in the role of of Ben Gates. Jon Voight and Hellen Mirren are simply dynamite together and could easily pull off a sequel by themselves. Diane Kruger is as hot as ever, but even she's not enough to save this dog of a film. In fact, ALL the acting in NT2 is very good, but the result is much less than the sum of the parts. Even great acting can't save a bad script. Don't waste your time -- you'll just be disappointed."

","I really liked the first film, but the newness has worn off this time around. It's the same concept except this time Ben Gates must prove his great grandfather had nothing to do with the assassination of Lincoln and instead knew the where abouts of another secret treasure, the city of gold. All the characters from last year are involved with the addition of Gates' mother. They look for clues in Europe, Washington DC, and Mount Rushmore. Ed Harris plays the bad guy who wants the treasure for himself. As to how they get from London to Mount Rushmore, they follow clues, exactly like the first film. And the comedy was very lackluster. A few of the comedic scenes worked, but many didn't.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Just not as enjoyable as the first one. The same plot points are used and little creativity is seen."

But all in all, this looks like a hormone-fed franchise just waiting to milked.<br/><br/>The swiss-cheese plot is about a race against bad guys to clear the name of one of Ben Gates' (Cage) forefathers (although ""one of his four fathers"" might have made for a more interesting premise). This after the revelation that they may have been complicit in the killing of...wait for it...Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>I'm convinced the writers realised that no-one would care about this, but being too lazy to start again (either that or too pre-occupied making writers strike picket placards), shifted the plot implausibly to a treasure hunt for a lost city of gold. And then threw in something about a conspiracy involving presidents just for good measure.<br/><br/>A hop to Paris, a skip to London and a jump back to the US later, one wonders if the plot devices aren't completely lost on US Americans who have no concept of maps (Geography)..and historical facts... and such as like.<br/><br/>PS: Will somebody please tell Miss Teen USA South Carolina that this is movie is not based on fact, and that there won't be a history pop quiz based on the movie after the screening - I heard she's stressing out about that."

","***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br/><br/>When National Treasure: Book of Secrets was near release, my two best friends were going crazy with anticipation. They loved the 1st movie, though they never really said why, just ""it was awesome"".... not very descriptive on there part. So we went to the midnight showing, and I will say my expectations weren't that high. Turns out I was right not to expect much.<br/><br/>Lets start with the good. The best part of the whole movie was the Goofy short before the movie. Not only was everyone laughing, it really set a good mood for the rest of the film. If you didn't like the film, at least you could think about the short to make you happy. I myself want to get into animation for a career. I'm not a fan of Disney cartoons (I actually hate a lot of them), but the fact that shorts in movies are coming back really warms my heart. The last time I remember shorts in movies were the Roger Rabbit shorts, and those were great. I REALLY hope to see more stuff like this in the future from other studios.<br/><br/>Next is the not so good. Though the treasure itself was interesting (city of gold, cool) you kinda feel like there holding information back from you. They find the city, have teams explore it, and there obviously gonna get some major historical information.... to bad you never actually get to know what that information is. They did the same thing in the last movie. <br/><br/>We got a treasure. ""Ok, what is the treasure?"" We're not gonna tell you. ""Um... well... what do we get to know about the treasure?"" Just that it's hidden and Nic Cage has to find it. ""When they do find it, will we learn anything about it, like what it is and how it will affect our knowledge of history?"" Nope. ""Oh... what the heck?""<br/><br/>Another thing that I didn't feel good about in this movie was the character Abigail Chase. So in the first movie, Ben spends his whole life looking for the treasure, and then finally does at the end with his 2 friends. He gets rich for finding it and buys house to live in with girlfriend. Then she dumps him and she kicks him out of HIS house? Is she a w****?<br/><br/>Finally, the really bad.... Riley. I'm sorry, but I couldn't not find him funny. I'm actually getting sick of one liners. People have seem to forgotten that there's more then one way to tell a joke. Everything nowadays is one liners. What ever happened to really funny facial expressions, Or someone getting hurt in a really funny way? Why does every sidekick need to be a goofy smart mouth who says dumb stuff that only a small amount of people find funny but then turns out to be a genius? <br/><br/>I'm also getting sick of people saying to just have fun with it. Well what if someone didn't think it was fun, would he have to put on a fake smile throughout the remainder of the film? Just because YOU think it was fun, doesn't mean so did everyone else.<br/><br/>All in all, it was OK, but nothing too special. If you have nothing better to do, this is an OK rental movie. The goofy short is the best part, so if anything go for that.<br/><br/>5/10"

"cdelacroix1","6","6","18","21 December 2007"," It's OK ... but that's about it ...
","I saw this movie this morning ... opening day here in Tulsa. And on the whole, my own reaction is that it's OK, but that's really about it.<br/><br/>The first National Treasure flick (2004) introduced us to Ben Gates, an engaging, adventuresome treasure hunter played by Nicolas Cage. Now we have a second installment in the franchise, and Nicolas Cage returns as Ben Gates. In addition, Justin Bartha returns as comical sidekick Riley Poole, Jon Voigt returns as Patrick Gates, Ben's father; and Diane Kruger returns as Abigail Chase, Ben's romantic interest.<br/><br/>The story line is full of archeology, history, humor, and adventure that takes our lead characters to Paris, London, Washington DC, and Mount Rushmore.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a pattern with which many are very familiar: the pattern successfully rendered in the Indiana Jones movies.<br/><br/>I won't give away anything except to say that I myself think that the National Treasure franchise is far less engaging than the Indiana Jones franchise. And I have to ask myself why.<br/><br/>I think, first, that scripts written for the Indiana Jones character always seem to me to be more convincing and more engaging. This has nothing to do with historical credibility: in this National Treasure movie, and its predecessor, we in the audience are fully aware that all the ""history"" in the movie is very, very unhistorical. Same for the Indiana Jones movies. However, in an Indiana Jones movie, the archaeological panoply is to me just so fascinating, and appealing, that I want it to be true even when I know it's not. And, in an Indiana Jones movie, the unfolding story is so much more fun than in a National Treasure movie. For both these reasons, in an Indiana Jones movie, I tend to take a look, roll my eyes, and then promptly suspend my disbelief and follow the storyline wherever it will lead me: it's that much fun and that attractive. Neither this National Treasure movie, nor its predecessor, lead me in this direction.<br/><br/>As for the lead characters, Indiana Jones is so much more appealing, to me, compared to Ben Gates. Indiana Jones, in his trademark hat and bull-whip, is such a wonderful figure, played almost tongue in cheek by Harrison Ford. But the character is so much fun, like the storyline, that again, I watch Ford's Indiana Jones, roll my eyes once or twice early on, and then suspend my disbelief and follow Indiana Jones while smiling through all his fascinating adventures. In contrast, Nicolas Cage's Ben Gates is a very different character, and just has no such appeal for me. In National Treasure: Book of Secrets, we see him at one point prancing comically on a staircase in Buckingham Palace. A few moments later, we see him peeping around a bouquet of flowers at his love interest. Watching Ben Gates in these scenes felt to me like I was watching a sort of metro-sexual version of Rowan Atkinson's Mr Bean character. I just can't see such a character as a heroic treasure hunter. In contrast, Indiana Jones is every inch a treasure hunter and hero. He's also a classic masculine hero, though one who is leavened by that occasional tongue in cheek irony.<br/><br/>About National Treasure: Book of Secrets: I did think this was better than the first National Treasure. The acting in the second movie, by everyone, was competent but unexceptional in delivering the script. The cinematography was good. Th4e dialog was sometimes entertaining. The the script overall supported a storyline, and a character, that didn't really appeal to me very much.<br/><br/>All the same, for light adventure and light entertainment, one could do a lot worse than go to this movie.<br/><br/>It's OK ... but that's about it, IMHO."

","During the first tedious outing, I was full of wonder about how the form of this developed. I am interested in the puzzle movie, something that nominally started with the mystery. Some intelligent movies devise ever more complex and subtle puzzles, the wonder of which engages the viewer.<br/><br/>Then there's the mainstream thread which asks ever less of the viewer, and merely panders to notions of how the mystery conspires to be so complex. Well that was what occupied be in the first embarrassment. Now we have this.<br/><br/>Second movies in a franchise fascinated me, especially when the producers are as ambitiously greedy as this one. That's because the first movie gives them an opportunity to test the thing to death and to refine the formula for the second. So if you see any change whatever, you can rest assured that it was because of very expensive testing, marketing considerations and an understanding of narrative tokens.<br/><br/>That's why I wonder what Helen Mirren is doing in this. She's 63. Now, recently she has given a serious study of Elizabeth, but this hiring decision was made well before that. Mirren's past is based on her overtly sexual being. She was essentially the first actress to make a living with her breasts and actually grow into a serious talent. But along the way, she has retained in many roles and most importantly in her public life, the sense of open sensuality. She's a sexual being first, and an intelligent observer of emotions behind that.<br/><br/>Its quite rare. So why is she in a kiddie movie? A PG-engineered dope-fest? Why is she more openly sexual than the ordinary love interest? <br/><br/>This is not accidental. Her wet top, her partially exposed breasts... these are engineered decisions. Why?<br/><br/>I think it is insurance. I think that when you build a franchise today, you have to do so thinking of the saleability in 30 years. DVD marketeers look at what older viewers like, and its no surprise that they like two things: the familiar and sex, or at least what implies sex. And they look at who will have all the money in 30 years. It won't be the youngsters because the old always steal from the young.<br/><br/>She's there so that when these 27 year old boys (the target) are grown into 63 year old men, they'll still rent this, or whatever amazing extras can be packaged. I'll bet nearly anything that there are salacious deleted scenes with this fearless woman. And probably naughty commentary as well.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","I have nothing against undemanding entertainment. I didn't see the first film in this series, and I sure as hell won't be going to see any subsequent ones. For anyone familiar with the oeuvre of Daffy Duck, there is a clear analogy here. Remember 'The Scarlet Pumpernickel'? Well there Daffy is in the process of selling the idea of a movie to an obtuse and artless film producer. But when all is done, the producer just wants more spectacle and more violence and more plot twists and... (you get the idea). <br/><br/>So it is with NT-BOS. Quite probably, in the first place, there was a reasonable film about a guy's attempts to unravel a mystery regarding Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Might have been entertaining. Might have even encouraged a modicum of cerebral activity. However, some crass producer/studio exec stepped in and wanted more more more of the stuff of multi-million dollar production values and less, less, less character development and narrative logic.<br/><br/>The result is a complete mess in which we care not one jot for the future and safety of the characters because they have not been properly presented to us. We are only hazily aware what is going on because the filmmakers mistake speed for pace. And at the end of the film we have not experienced the ride that we were hoping for because someone didn't understand the truth that in the cinema, not enough is highly preferable to too much."

","After really disliking the first National Treasure and not being a huge Nicholas Cage fan I had terribly low expectations for this. It looked like a rehash of the first with a different treasure to hunt. Surprisingly this turned out to be an enjoyable way to spend two hours, that is of course, if you are willing to suspend logic and remember this is a Hollywood movie through and through. With those two bits of knowledge in mind you should be able to enjoy this as I did. The pacing is perfect for a movie like this, it goes nice and fast and never really gets boring. I must admit it some of it seemed believable, which shows that the writers did a good job. And I was able to tolerate Mr. Cage this time, I thought he did a very good job and as usual Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, Helen Mirren and Ed Harris were great (although Harris' villain was pretty bland, luckily he can act).<br/><br/>The action was also very well filmed and at times highly excited and well thought out (the balancing rock sequence was exceptionally well done). Having said all this, it certainly isn't anything brilliant and if you like smart, deep movies this is not for you.<br/><br/>3/5"

","Let me summarize this first quickly; National Treasure: Book of secrets is a great fun BLOCKBUSTER movie and better than its proceeder! The only reason i capitalized blockbuster is because the movie is (obviously) not Oscar-worthy, but a great end to a year full fantastic movies! Critics might not have enjoyed it, but i recommend it if u're looking for what may have been a great entry this summer! The performances are good; Nicholas Cage is still enjoying his role, Bartha is funny, and Helen Mirren and Jon Voight are actually nice together! The plot is interesting, but the highlight of this movie is not only the jaw dropping breathtaking car chase in London, but the stunning scenes in Buckingham palace, in the white house(where it becomes comedic as Cage tries to steal a ""board"" from the president's table while Diane Kruger seduces a guy who works there)and in the library of congress where he steals the Book of secrets (which i've never been to). I was waiting for the kidnap of the president, but I was a bit disappointed because he ends up not kidnapping him but taking him inside a cave and asks him about the whereabouts of the book(But that scene remains cool, and one of the best scenes in the movie) In addition to that, the movie features an amazing scene when the 4 characters try to maintain the balance of a swaying platform. (the city of gold is gold!) Even though the movie doesn't features lots of clues like the first one, it's better!"

","Even with a stellar cast of Nicolas Cage, Jon Voight and Helen Mirren, nothing can really save this desperately pathetic film.<br/><br/>I really thought I was in for a good civil war production on those really responsible for the assassination of President Lincoln. Instead, we go all over the place while searching for an ancient city of gold. Only through such a miserable script could Cage be able to figure out the outrageous clues that are left.<br/><br/>As far as Queen Victoria siding with the Confederacy, forget that. Yes, it's true that the England needed the south's cotton, but the former wisely chose to be neutral in the conflict.<br/><br/>We have chase scenes in London, England to rival that of a James Bond thriller.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is that they let the theme go complete awry and the result is an absolute stinker of a film."
"ExpendableMan","7","2","4","2 June 2008"," Nicholas Cage and the Guilty Pleasure of Doom
","Not satisfied with stealing the Declaration of Independence last time around, half way through this movie Nicholas Cage says in that trademark drawl of his the words: ""I'm going to kidnap the President of the United States."" In the preceding hour he's not only broken into Buckingham Palace but the Oval Office as well and in the ensuing hour he discovers a top secret diary in the Library of Congress and a Pre-Columbian temple buried in a cave network beneath Mount Rushmore. You can only wonder where they're going to go when the inevitable third entry comes around in 2011, but I wouldn't put it past them kidnapping the Pope and finding Atlantis underneath the Toronto Skydome. As you can probably tell then, National Treasure: Book of Secrets is preposterous guff, but it nevertheless possesses a sense of charm and a feeling of urgency that was lacking from its predecessor.<br/><br/>First off the good news, the franchise has improved. The original National Treasure wasn't particularly strong and smelt too strongly of a cross between Indiana Jones and the Da Vinci Code designed purely to cash in on the recent success of Dan Brown's novel. This second instalment however is a lot more fun, the two hour running time zipping past at a remarkable pace as the cast are hurtled from America to France, to England and then back again in a globe trotting adventure to locate a mythical lost city of gold (sorry Dr. Jones they beat you to it). Its a good thing too, if it slowed down for a second there'd be more opportunities to pick up the numerous plot holes - how this is all going to clear the name of Ben Gates's long dead ancestors for instance is never explained particularly well. Neither is why it's so remarkably easy for a history Professor to keep avoiding the CIA.<br/><br/>Carbon copy of an established original it may be then but National Treasure 2 still packs in enough outlandish stupidity, dizzying set pieces and intriguing historical trivia to have it ear marked as a guilty pleasure. Ever wanted to know how to use a London traffic camera to record a vital piece of evidence while in the middle of a car chase? This is the film for you. As an added bonus it's also the most animated that Nicholas Cage has been in years, avoiding his recent tendency to phone things in by playing Ben Gates with just the right mixture of rebellious humour and deadpan seriousness. Granted, it's just a bit too obvious where all the chief inspirations have come from but even so, National Treasure 2 is entertaining enough to warrant a night in front of the television with your brain switched off.<br/><br/>And at least the Lost City of Gold in this movie doesn't have a flying saucer buried in it."
"ed_two_o_nine","5","2","4","4 May 2008"," Book of Mediocrity
","I have not seen the first film in this series so I am unable to comment on how well this film holds up against it, but I have to assume it was mildly successful to warrant a sequel, however for the life of me I can not see why. It is not that this is a bad movie it is just that it is completely mediocre in every aspect and completely devoid of inspiration, this truly is just a poor man's Indiana Jones. Nicholas Cage plays the lead character Ben Gates a treasure hunter like his father before him who becomes involves in a fight to clear his families name names from being involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Unsurprisingly this ends up in Ben and his ensemble (ex wife Abigal Chase and erstwhile colleague Riley Poole) on a globe trotting mission to reveal the secrets in all sorts of historical artefacts and locations that will lead to the truth and clear the family. The problems for me where that I just did not care about any of the cast. Nic Cage was really just acting by numbers and the film managed to waste the joint talents of John Voight, Ed Harris and Helen Mirren which in it's self in my opinion is the film's greatest achievement. The direction is run of the mill and a little research on the director Jon Turtletuab led me to unsurprisingly find that his previous television and film work had also been mediocre. Not one for me and not worth a second viewing."
"Panterken","5","2","4","12 January 2008"," More of the good stuff from the first one, unfortunately the flaws from the original are still there too.
","National Treasure 2 is definitely as good as it's predecessor, which can be said about almost no other sequels. Then again, I think the original was entertaining enough but a too clichéd Disney movie. I pretty much feel the same way about this movie. Pretty predictable & clichéd and not that well acted. Maybe I'm just starting to dislike Nicolas Cage after the recent debacles Ghost Rider, Next and The Wicker Man.<br/><br/>The riddles were fun and original, but I thought the whole concept of the tour through Europe's and America's touristic sites became a little stupid after a while (just like in the first one). It feels like a lot of the film was just product placement and promotion of tourism. Also, the movie seemed to reek of right wing nationalism...Disney movies are not supposed to be political are they.<br/><br/>Another reason why I think the National Treasure movies fail is...the inevitable comparison with the Indiana Jones trilogy, which is in a totally other cinematic class. The film should be compared to films like Indiana Jones and The Da Vinci code since it does borrow a thing or two (understatement). National treasure comes out poorly in the comparisons and therefore is...mediocre.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm nitpicking here. The film does exactly what it's supposed to do...entertain. I do have one advice...watch it in the cinema. It's a popcorn flick that really isn't gonna be the same when you watch it at home. 5.4/10 is a fair score for an entertaining yet flawed movie. I hope people can be fair and not bash my comment, just because I ended up giving it a 5. IMDb points are not like tests results in school, 5 is a score for an average movie, not 7 like a lot of people seem to assume."

","The acting is quite OK, but they don't have much to work with. I hear the script writers are on strike.<br/><br/>Several places the narrative goes overboard, in the form of fake dialog that really serves as not-so-subtle reminders for the viewer who may have less than 5 minute attention span.<br/><br/>By all means, do something else while watching the film; you may have time to read a good book during the quiet parts.<br/><br/>How many times do you need to be told that the steering wheel is in the wrong side in London? If you feel like blurting ""Thank you!"" after a couple of times, you probably will get very annoyed before the film is over.<br/><br/>The hypocritical correctness reaches nauseating levels at least twice. When the good guys have to sacrifice a member to escape a trap, they are magically able to substitute a golden icon. Next time, the ""word of honor"" of our hero is good for about 60-90 seconds only. He conveniently has to help his parents, so he can sacrifice the bad guy, and his promise to assist evaporates the exact moment the door slams shut after him.<br/><br/>The the copy&paste jobs from old James Bond films is like watching a five year old copy Mona Lisa. But I was amused by his butterfly and champagne hidden under the dry suit.<br/><br/>On a big screen, it is unbearable how the most trivial little puns are repeated and exaggerated, much like when a little kid tells a joke.<br/><br/>Very pretty film with very little content."

This is innocent entertainment and what is wrong with that? Do we really want the horror of Aliens & Predators, or the carnivore creatures in I am Legend around this time of year? I do not! This is a nice, well told, Walt Disney story about treasures and secrets. This movie lives up to it's promise in that respect. People who expect it also to have a major character development want too much. Just like Da Vinci code stories, they are plot driven, not character driven Fellini movies. Just sit back, relax, and go for the experience. I wanted to see a movie that took me to London, Paris, the White House and 'Who Killed JFK' and here it is. I think the characters were fun, just as they should be in the story. At least it has a lot of irony in it, which makes it even more fun. I hope they will make a third. Nicholas Cage is getting old? What does that mean? We all do! I think he is good, still is. Well done guys, at least some positive and decent stuff out here around Christmas!"

","I saw National Treasure: Book of Secrets last night in a VERY packed theater house. I was impressed with the crowd right off the bat. All ages were represented that night. I admit I didn't expect too much from this film, since most sequels these days don't deliver as much, or more, than the originals. But I was pleasantly surprised with this one.<br/><br/>I only had a few minor gripes with the movie. The actual puzzle solving wasn't quite as long and drawn out, or even as complex as the first movie's. It was basically getting a combination to the two desks, getting the combination to the President's book, and reaching for a latch inside the rock. So the actual puzzle/riddle element of this one wasn't as intense as the first, but it was still enjoyable. I also didn't think the city of gold was quite as impressive looking as the original's Knights Templar's treasure.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the new locations the film went to this time. The car chase was as good as it could have been done for a PG movie. The whole theater DIED laughing in the scene in London where Gates and Abigail made their argument and he makes fun of the British guard's accent. Riley added his witty nonsense once again as well.<br/><br/>Just take this film for what it is: a fun, nonviolent, fantasy adventure. No bad words said in the whole movie, no blood to be seen, and only one person dies. Big props to Ed Harris by the way. Having him in the movie was a HUGE lift. He's been very good in many movies. He basically replaced the villain role from Sean Benn in the original.<br/><br/>So don't be afraid that this one will disappoint. It was a very worthy sequel."

There are the iconic characters (the smart hero and his love/hate girlfriend, the funny hero's assistant, the divorced hero's parents, the bad but not so bad guy, the good cop and so on).

2) The main characters are extremely lucky.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1) Ben ridiculously knew everything at the perfect time.
2) Riley could hack everything, even the Buckingham Palace and the White House.
3) When there was the chasing in London, the police did not do anything.
4) Abigail luckily was in a relationship with someone important from the White House. That person was also luckily easy to engineer.
5) They were able to infiltrate the White House that did not have proper security.
6) Connor believed that Abigail's earring was lost in the Oval Office.
7) Connor should have heard the sound of Ben doing something with the desk.
8) The president agreed to discover the secret tunnel during a party with only few guards.
9) The security during the president's birthday party was weak.
10) How did Ben know about the secret tunnel at Mount Vernon?
11) The event organizer could not find any places other than Mount Vernon. They should have prepared long time ago with backup plan. They could also have special access for venue.

Also, Cage gets a bit cagy, and it had me wondering if this is where he lost it a bit, before diving into b movie territory. There were a lot of hints here at possible sequels but I think Disney was done with this franchise, and thats too bad really, there was a lot of potential."
"stephenabell","6","0","0","6 March 2020"," It Had A Lot To Live Up To...
","So, not such a great sequel. It did have a lot to live up to. And though it's not too dead it definitely doesn't have as much life or action as the original.<br/><br/>This could be down to the change in the writers, with only the Wibberleys staying on from the original. However, even the direction doesn't quite hit the right spots.<br/><br/>Even though the story has Ben Gates, Cage, in more personal dilemmas than the first story, I just couldn't get behind the tale or the character this time. Time has ticked by and the future has seen some changes in Gates' life. His sidekick Riley, Bartha, is living the good life on his one per cent. He has broken up with Abigail, Kruger, and she is now seeing new people. Then evidence comes to light asserting that one of his ancestors killed Abraham Lincoln. So he resolves to get the gang back together and solve this new mystery.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story isn't as well thought through and comes across a tad humdrum. Another undoing was the characters. These are not as distinct and complete as they were. The interactions between them appear forced, at times, and a little insipid. They feel as though they're there to move the story forward and not to add substance to the film. Even though the story calls for Ben and Abigail to rekindle their affections, their obvious chemistry from the first film is gone. Most of the time, there is an awkwardness between the two. In truth, all the wonderful transactions between the characters have taken a critical hit. Only Ben and his dad Patrick, Jon Voight, still have a semblance of the relationship they shared in the first story.<br/><br/>This leaves it up to Jon Turtletaub to save the film. This he does, though he doesn't reach the heights of the original. His main impediment is the end action sequence. Up to this point, there's been very little action. Then when we get to the great finale it's not that great. It's too crowded and frantic making it difficult to completely follow what's happening. This makes it less exciting to watch. Then when they get to the tipping balance you begin to think, WTF! It smacks of the writers and the director trying too hard to be cool.<br/><br/>The cast, as in the original, do a pretty decent job with the story and direction they are given. That is, except for Ed Harris. I have never been a big Ed Harris fan and this film shows why perfectly. A bad guy needs a persona, something the audience can boo or at least feel some satisfaction when they lose. Mitch Wilkinson has no persona whatsoever. In fact, the guy is so dull and tedious that when he makes his first appearance at Gates' presentation I'm amazed anybody notices him. He has the ""Wha... wha... wha..."" of Charlie Brown's teacher. This character needed an actor with screen presence.<br/><br/>Because the original film is so good I would not recommend you watch this film. It will be a letdown. Instead, do yourself a favour and watch the original again. If you've not watched the original yet then forget this one and get a copy of the first film, sit back, and enjoy that one.<br/><br/>Feel free to traverse over to my The Game Is Afoot and Holding Out For A Hero lists to see where I've charted this less than enthralling sequel. Who knows, your next favourite film may be awaiting you there."

","""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" (2007), the first movie was phenomenal. So, I had high hopes for this sequel. All I have to say is, wow! My expectations were met, and then some. This sequel is a rare example of one that's equally as good as the first movie. Just like ""National Treasure"" (2004), this movie has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, perfect sets/locations, and also a perfect soundtrack. The story is very creative, and I was excited, invested and there were a few laughs along the way. A good sequel is a movie that continues after the first one, with no looking back. But, it doesn't hurt to have at least some references to the first film. Sequels should be similar in layout to the first one, but still be it's own distinct story. ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" definitely hits the mark! The cast is fantastic! Nicolas Cage, Justin Bartha, Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, Diane Kruger, and more. They all perform their roles flawlessly. There are also a couple of new characters in this film: Helen Mirren as Emily Gates, Bruce Greenwood as the President, and Ed Harris as the villain, Mitch Wilkinson. All of the brand new characters add a new layer of depth to this film. Helen Mirren is serious, yet funny, as Ben's mother, Emily. Ed Harris as Mitch Wilkinson is a great villain, and Bruce Greenwood is fantastic as the President. But, just like the first movie, Nicolas Cage steals the show! His role in the ""National Treasure"" franchise as Benjamin Gates is perfect for him. Had some other actor played the role, it would not have worked at all. This, in my opinion, along with the first movie, is Nicolas Cage's best role and performance! As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they all perform their roles perfectly and all of the actors have great chemistry. The special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. All of the sets/locations are perfect and really set the tone. Finally, the film soundtrack, composed by Trevor Rabin, is excellent! It also really helps set the tone, and brings the movie to life. ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is a fun and exciting movie watching experience. Director Jon Turteltaub, you made lightning strike twice with this sequelI can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I obviously give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"", what are you waiting for? Go watch it today! I really hope that they make ""National Treasure 3"", because of the big cliffhanger at the end. We all want to know what's on page 47!"

There is some drama, though perhaps not enough and the funny comedy doesn't always seem to balance the adventure aspect. Overall, though the movie was enjoyable, fun, a thrill ride if not completely transporting into the Indiana Jones realm.

The story zips from beat to beat, but the puzzle solving and mythmaking are scaled back and it ultimately lacks the original's propulsive energy. The cast sees some major additions in Ed Harris, Helen Mirren and Bruce Greenwood, all of whom do more w/less, as you'd expect. The returning cast all fall back into their original chemistry and help to keep you invested even when the plot doesn't.

","National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a better movie then the original national treasure movie. The cast stays the same except trade in Sean Bean for Ed Harris and add on Helen Mirren. The acting is good here, I enjoyed cage and Kruger, very good chemistry, even better here than in the first. And I loved seeing Helen Mirren in this film, she is a fine actress and I loved her performance as Ben's mom and Patrick's ex-wife. The dynamic between Mirren and Voight is interesting and they work very well together. On to the action and treasure hunting. The action are done well, not overstuffed with over the top special effects and not cheesy looking. The movie has a nice pace to it and I enjoyed every destination they went to, they were all important to the movie as a whole. This is pretty enjoyable film that is sure to entertain all audiences. I definitely suggest it for family viewing, it's not too rough or intense or too weak and child like, perfect medium. The kids will have good fun with the treasure hunt and the clues they discover along the way and with the action sequences. And the adults can enjoy that and the interesting interactions between the characters that will probably fly over younger kids heads. 8/10 for national treasure: book of secrets."

","Released in 2007 and directed by Jon Turteltaub, ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" brings back Nicolas Cages as Ben Gates, along with his assistant, Riley (Justin Bartha), hot girlfriend (Diane Kruger) and father (Jon Voight). This time Ben's great grandfather is accused of co-conspiracy in Lincoln's assassination and so Ben & Co. travel wide and far to clear his name. The first stop is Paris, then Buckingham Palace, then the White House and ultimately Mount Rushmore. Their misadventures include kidnapping the president (Bruce Greenwood) and desperately seeking to find Cibola (see-BOWL-uh), the legendary Native American City of Gold. Ed Harris appears as the villain, Helen Mirren as Ben's mother and Harvey Keitel as the chief Fed. <br/><br/>It's best to watch the original 2004 movie first so you're familiar with the main characters. This is a slickly-made, fun sequel and there's a lot to like about it if you're a fan of the first movie and the Indiana Jones flicks. But it somehow pales in comparison to the nigh great original. Something about the story fails to fully engage; and the increasingly absurd clues become eye-rolling. Thankfully, there are several highlights, like the sequences with the president. And you can tell the cast had a good time together. The score is kinetic, composed by Yes' Trevor Rabin, like the first film. <br/><br/>The movie runs 124 minutes and was shot in Virginia, Maryland, Washington DC, South Dakota, Southern California, England and Paris.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+ (5.5/10)"

","The plot was pretty weak and overall wasn't very interesting, it's very easy to either forget most of the movie or mix it up with the first one. There seem to be a lot of inaccuracies with the film, and I'm sincerely hoping no one actually believes a lot of what they saw. It's also a exceptionally strange story, if you thought it was wild for Nicolas Cage to steal the Declaration of Independence then be prepared to be shocked by how Cage convinces the President of the United States to follow him through a shady looking tunnel as a step to finding a treasure that may or may not actually exist. It's a good movie if you don't have high standards, or if you like movies that are easy to follow."

","National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007): Dir: Jon Turtletaub / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight, Helen Mirren, Justin Bartha: Exciting adventure about facts buried from truth. Nicolas Cage quests to find evidence proving that his great-great grandfather was not responsible for the assassination of President Lincoln. To prove this he must locate the lost city of gold. Director Jon Turtletaub is backed with thrilling action and visual elements that play out through the entire film. He is a director who crosses many genres with films ranging from While You Were Sleeping and Phenomenon. Cage leads the cast and is thrust head strong into adventure as he sets out to clear his family name. On the negative end the romantic elements are quite obvious and predictable. Diane Kruger plays his ex-girlfriend who is talked into joining him and who will obviously end up with him by film's end. Jon Voight plays his father who must face his ex-wife, played by Helen Mirren for assistance. She is skilled at reading special markings on artifacts. Both will clearly reconcile but along the way they are responsible for a great deal of humour. Justin Bartha returns as Cage's best friend but the role is sidelined by the central roles, which are more interesting. While it is not Raiders of the Lost Ark, it is still entertaining and pointless fun that should be a treasure for the entirely family. Score: 8 Â½ / 10"

","Following in the wake of the 2004 movie ""National Treasure"", Benjamin Franklin Gates (played by Nicolas Cage) is back searching for one of the most significant treasures in American history. Gates is following clues left in John Wilkes Booth's diary in order to prove his ancestor's innocence in the Lincoln assassination. And that leads him on the track of a great treasure, a city of gold.<br/><br/>The story in ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is much similar to the story in the 2004 movie. A group of people chasing after important clues hidden in the most unlikely of places in order to get to an ancient city of gold. So if you liked the first movie, then you will also get some enjoyment out of this sequel.<br/><br/>However, I found the clues and the locations in part two to be a bit too far fetched, and it was getting hard to buy into it after a while. That being said, I will claim that the movie is still entertaining enough, it just never managed to get over the mediocrity level.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage, Justin Bartha, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel all return for the sequel, reprising their roles from the 2004 movie. In addition to these talents, then ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" also offers the talents of Helen Mirren and Ed Harris, both of whom did bring something good to the movie.<br/><br/>It just wasn't fully as entertaining nor compelling as the first movie, and as such then I am rating ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" a mediocre five out of ten stars."
"TheMovieDoctorful","8","0","0","4 December 2015"," When The Cast Is Having Fun, So Am I
","The first ""National Treasure"" was a fun, little movie. Nothing spectacular, but a well-casted, well-paced, clever movie with a great sense of humor. ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" completely blows its predecessor out of the water. The biggest reason for that? Everyone involved is just having the time of their lives.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage has long been my favorite actor of all time, and while this is CERTAINLY not one of his best performances, he does a really good job as Ben Gates. He gets a chance in this installment to show off more of the comedic, over-the-top kookiness that we've come to expect of Cage over the years in fare like ""Face/Off"" or ""Con Air."" Cage is just having so much more fun this time around, and his performance gets a lotta laughs. Diane Kruger gives a fine performance as Abigail Chase, Ben's ex-girlfriend and right hand- woman in his quest for the truth. Their chemistry is kind of ""on and off"" in this movie, but when it works, (i.e, the fake argument scene and the scene following it) it REALLY works. <br/><br/>Justin Bartha does an excellent job as Riley Poole, Cage's charming sidekick. His acting reminds me a lot of Seth Green in a lot of ways, and given how much a fan I am of Green, that's a major compliment. Bartha's hilarious in this movie, while still proving to be more than competent and intelligent in Gate's search to clear his great-grandfather's name.<br/><br/>As for Jon Voight, as always, the man is fantastic. He puts a lot of passion in his performance of a man with strong familial ties desperate to find the truth, and his character has really grown and developed a lot more from the first movie. And, like most of the cast, he's pretty damn funny when the script requires him to be. He steals the show here.<br/><br/>The action is extremely well done for a Disney movie. Required to maintain a ""PG"" rating, ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" has to rely on the speed, tension and suspense of their action sequences rather than violence in order to capture the attention of the audience, and I absolutely feel like the film does that. The film does a great job putting characters we like and care about in suspenseful, dangerous situations we desperately want them to escape.<br/><br/>""Suspenseful"" is the key word for ""Book of Secrets."" Even in non- action related sequences, the film did a great job always keeping me on my toes in numerous scenes; from breaking into Buckingham Palace to Gates himself kidnapping the President of the United States! The whole film is an exciting, fun, tense ride.<br/><br/>I only have 2 big problems with the film; 1) The villains. Ed Harris gives a good performance here as Mitch Wilkinson, but his character is just never that interesting. I suppose he's better than Ian from the first movie, but that's not saying much. I wish these films would give us villains with more interesting personalities and backstories and better motivation than just ""Give me the treasure!"" 2) The ""PG"" rating. Much like the first film, I can't help watching this wishing that it was PG-13, which could have allowed the action sequences to be more intense and entertaining and possibly allowed for a darker story. I mean, the ""Pirates"" movies were all PG-13, ""John Carter"" was PG-13, the new Star Wars is going to be PG-13, so not sure why Disney couldn't make either National Treasure installments PG-13 movies.<br/><br/>Despite those problems, ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is still a well casted, funny, insanely entertaining action movie that really managed to compel me and hold my attention, and a vast improvement over its predecessor. This is a production where everybody aboard is just happy to be here. And that happiness is contagious."

","The film opens up with 5 Days after Civil War ends, or suppose to have. Something goes down and the blame is put on Ben's (Cage) father or grandfather.

I found this sequel much better ACTION, however, the title of the sequel could be revisited as in the first one, they had a set goal of looking for a map, they found it, then the clues. Whereas this one they were looking for a Book of Secrets, BUT the clues were ELSEWHERE, meaning where was the need for the book? Music was wonderful a pleasure to listen to in the background.

That said, there are some nice location shots at Buckingham Palace and Mount Rushmore and the recreation of the City of Gold is certainly impressive.<br/><br/>I don't want to be too hard on this film, it didn't displease me, but it wasn't smart enough to insert telling humour to leaven the journey and at no point did I feel my hands gripping the arms of my chair as a good adventure really should."

Ben even finds himself once again being pursued by FBI Agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel).<br/><br/>If the idea of a near-exact copy of the first movie turns you off, then I'd advise you to stay away.

","Something like a cross between the Da Vinci Code and Raiders of the Lost Arc, although not too scary or anything. Nicholas Cage is Ben Gates, a rich guy who likes to give talks about his historical interests. After giving a lecture about the Lincoln assassination, a chiselled figure, Mitch Wilkinson, appears with a missing page from diary of John Wilkes Booth which appears to implicate Ben Gates' ancestors as a co-conspirator in the assassination. To prove his great great grandfather's innocence, Gates sets out on an adventure which follows a set of clues which ultimately lead to a search for the fabled ""City of Gold"". Fortunately Gates' best friend is an electronics wizard which enables them to bypass security measures and have convenient access to highly guarded areas such as Buckingham Palace and the Oval Office of the White House. Even more convenient, other family members know extinct languages and can read ancient runes. A Love interest tags along and Mitch Wilkinson reveals himself as a bad guy who is trailing Gates, hoping to grab any loot they may uncover. Geared toward an audience with a low attention span, the pace is fast and they don't get stuck on difficult clues for long. Ludicrous plot probably wouldn't prevent this film from succeeding as a Saturday morning TV adventure for preteens. Trevor Rabin soundtrack seems apt."

","In ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets,"" the 2007 sequel to the original ""National Treasure"" from 2004, historian Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) finds himself in the distinctly unenviable position of having to clear his great-great-grandfather's name from the charge - being leveled by a black market antiquities dealer (Ed Harris) - that his forefather played a major role in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In order to prove the accusation wrong, thereby restoring not only his ancestor's reputation but his own in the process, Gates must uncover the whereabouts of a treasure map leading to the fabled City of Gold built by a tribe of pre-Columbian Native Americans. (And don't bother asking how those two things are related because, even after watching the movie, I'm still not sure I would be able to tell you).<br/><br/>""Book of Secrets,"" produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Jon Turteltaub and directed by Turteltaub, is a giant Rube Goldberg contraption about a series of Rube Goldberg contraptions. In terms of the story, there are more twists and turns, leaps in logic, conspiracy theories and contrived red herrings than even the most astute puzzle-solver should be required to keep up with. Luckily, the action moves along at a quick enough pace - including an impressive car chase through the streets and alleyways of London - that one doesn't have much time to question the sense of it all.<br/><br/>The actors certainly do throw themselves into the spirit of the enterprise, running around like mad through an assortment of colorful, touristy settings - from the Eiffel Tower to Buckingham Palace to the White House to Mount Vernon to the Library of Congress to Mount Rushmore - but the film, taken as a whole, is a pretty soulless exercise overall. Most grating is the stereotypical love/hate relationship between Ben and his ex-girlfriend, Abigail (Diane Kruger), an archivist at the National Archives, who are obviously still hopelessly, madly in love with one another and only need one more epic, life-threatening adventure to bring that truth home to them - which puts the audience one step ahead of the sleuthers to begin with. And as if that weren't enough, we're treated to a second bickering couple - Ben's divorced mother (Helen Mirren) and father (Jon Voight) - to parallel the first and double our displeasure.<br/><br/>The problem with a movie like this one is that, no matter how well it's put together on a technical level, finally, after what feels like the thousandth uncovered clue and the millionth hairbreadth escape from a fate-worse-than-death, the viewer simply exhausts himself trying to keep up with it all and stops paying attention."

","My Take: Goofy and implausible, but entertaining nonetheless.<br/><br/>Imagine finding out that your great grandfather was a part of an infamous assassination of a famous American President, because some guy claims to have found long lost evidence to prove. Now imagine anyone would still give a damn about this and you got the whole plot of NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS. It's not very different from the original NATIONAL TREASURE, also silly, which wasn't really different from so many other quest/treasure hunt movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE and Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE and maybe, say, a puzzle book for kids. It's all pretty goofy, with a plot that doesn't just border on ludicrous, but just plain ridiculous. It uses centuries of American history as plot devices and twists. Goofy fun, but fun nonetheless.<br/><br/>Like the original NATIONAL TREASURE, you should take it for what it is and it's actually a pretty good ride, but a bumpy one to be sure. Nicolas Cage, who still sports that goof hairdo from NEXT that makes Tom Hanks' mullet in THE DA VINCI CODE look ""in"", is back as archeology know-all Ben Gates who is forced to search for more hidden treasure buried beneath American history just to clear out hi family name, dented by the possible fact that his great grandfather could be an accomplice in the Lincoln assassination. Once again, Gates and the gang, his girlfriend Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) and buddy Riley (Justin Bartha), must decipher a series of hidden clues, use his history know-all to crack open the history-old secret. And I thought the ending for THE DA VINCI CODE was silly! <br/><br/>So with all this case-cracking, riddle-solving or what not have to do with the titular Book of Secrets? Well, it's the book where all the government's secrets are written in and could possibly lead them closer to where ""X"" marks the spot. It's really a McGuffin of course, which is just an excuse for Cage and co. to fool around in Buckingham Palace, The White House and eventually in Mt. Rushmore. Ridiculous really, but in this case I can forgive the overall ridiculousness of the piece and just went along for the ride. In the film is aided by a strong supporting cast, which includes Ed Harris as the mysterious baddie who uncovers the missing page of John Wilkes Booth's diary and John Voight and (what do ya' know!) Helen Mirren as Ben's parents. Cage is still in his goofy, over-the-top form, but the case of NATIONAL TREASURE movies, his performance just feels right at home with all the nonsense in display. So, yeah, NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS is a pretty silly movie, an empty-headed affair that requires you to suspend your disbelief as far as you can. <br/><br/>Rating: *** out of 5."

","Time for the inevitable National Treasure sequel and your feelings about this movie should pretty much reflect your feelings about the first one. If you liked the original you'll like this. If the first movie didn't do it for you well then there's nothing for you here because it's basically the same movie all over again. It's a pretty simple formula really. Take a movie which made hundreds of millions of dollars, add a couple of European locations, toss in a dash of Ed Harris and a dollop of Helen Mirren and then sit back and collect further hundreds of millions of dollars.<br/><br/>The sequel does on the surface seem slightly more plausible than the original but that's really not saying much. Our heroes won't have to steal the Declaration of Independence this time. But they will have to take apart the Queen of England's desk, sneak into the Oval Office and kidnap someone who quite simply cannot be kidnapped. And of course they'll also need to get their hands on the Book of Secrets because that is after all the name of the movie. What's in that Book of Secrets? Well, it's a secret. But it's safe to say there will be more treasure to be found because apparently we didn't discover enough treasure in the first movie. I anxiously await National Treasure 50 by which point I'm sure we will have learned that you can find billions of dollars worth of gold buried somewhere in each of the fifty states if only you have Nicolas Cage to help you look for it.<br/><br/>Cage of course plays the central role of treasure hunter Ben Gates and he's surrounded by much of the same cast as last time around. Jon Voight again plays Ben's father, Diane Kruger his love interest and Justin Bartha his treasure-hunting sidekick. Cage, Voight and Kruger are really no better or worse than the first time around. Bartha's character is much less annoying this time. After trying so desperately hard to be funny, and failing miserably at it, in the first film the character fits much better in this movie. All of those groan-inducing one-liners Bartha was forced to spout in the first movie have been removed. Well, most of them anyway. The two new roles of any significance are taken up by Harris as the villain and Mirren as Ben's mother. Harris is somewhat surprisingly bland in his bad guy role. Adding Mirren was a nice touch however and she plays off of Cage and Voight very well. The fact Ben's mother happens to be one of the few people on the planet capable of interpreting one of the clues is either convenient or contrived, I'm not quite sure which.<br/><br/>Anyhow Ben Gates and friends proceed pretty much exactly as they did in the first movie. Decipher some clues, avoid the bad guy, decipher some more clues, avoid the bad guy again, try not to get killed by ancient treasure-protecting booby traps. It really is the same exact thing we saw the first time. But that's not all bad. The plot is reasonably engrossing and entertaining. There are some nice action moments, some decent touches of humor here and there. It's a movie that was never meant to be taken particularly seriously. For what it is it works. More or less."

","'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' has all the ingredients of a successful action adventure but something was lacking. The execution (that is, camera-work, editing, music, element of suspense etc) is brilliant. The action and comedy scenes were fun to watch. However, I felt that much of it was rushed. There isn't enough time for the historical jargon to sink into the viewer's mind because the movie quickly shifts to the next scene as the events move at a rapid pace. It just felt too rushed. The shift in location to Paris and London is nice but the scenes are too limited. Yet, there is a cool action sequence that takes place in the London scene. Another thing is that the way Ben and his team manage to solve their problem, such as, by getting into Buckingham Palace or kidnapping the president, just seems a little too easy. Then again, it's meant to be an entertaining action movie and I guess this can be excused. Nicholas Cage is in form and he's back with his old team that include the dependable Jon Voight, the ravishing Diane Kruger and the scene-stealer Justin Bartha. This time there is the additional benefit of seeing Ed Harris and the lovely Helen Mirren. 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' is still entertaining and perhaps during second viewing it will be easier to pay more attention to the historical aspects since we know the main story already. I will be looking forward to the third one."

The trailer looked like it had potential with promising tense scenes like breaking into London's Buckingham Palace and the White House, holding the President himself hostage for the purpose to unravel the plot behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Being the enthusiastic film critic that I am, I went on my mission to to the sequel to ""National Treasure"" just for the sake of it. And although there was plenty of action to keep you entertained, and no scenes were never short of boredom, many scenarios left me in a state of confusion and I left the theater clueless. <br/><br/>Archaeologist Dr. Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) receives the grim news that his great-grandfather was behind the plot to murder President Lincoln. The evidence was brought to attention from a soldier (Ed Harris). In his search to prove this is untrue, Gates goes on a dangerous mission in search of a treasure that his deceased relative protected from the clutches of the Confedrate government. Helping Dr. Gates in his quest is a longtime comrade (Justin Bartha), his lover (Diane Kruger) and his father (Jon Voight). The journey takes the gang to Paris, Buckingham Palace, The White House and finally South Dakota's Mt. Rushmore. Also joining the gang is Gates' mother (Helen Mirren), a linguist in many Native languages.<br/><br/>Many absurd question left me curious. What does this treasure serve to prove a relative's innocence? What nomadic Native tribe successfully traveled from Florida to South Dakota at a time when transportation was very limited? And finally what the hell is so secretive on page 47 of the President's Book of Secrets?<br/><br/>All in all the action sequences were fun to watch like all Jerry Bruckheimer produced movies. It falls in the same format that made Indiana Jones a cultural icon. Maybe it's better to not worry about the format of the script and just watch the action because if you do, this movie will take a downward spiral. I must say, the actors look like they're having a ball, especially Justin Bartha who delivers some of the best lines in the movie. Voight, Mirren and Harris though are only after a quick buck. The writers were crafty to manipulate its audience into thinking they've made a clever script, but we are much smarter to know that is not the case. <br/><br/>Director Jon Turtletaub, you're much better at making romantic comedies. Action-adventures are just not your forte. While this movie is an improvement than the first part, there is still more tweaking that needs to be done if this series should make another sequel. <br/><br/>I'm trying to be fair about this movie as much as I can, but I think this movie is only successful in the thrill factor rather than showing any historical accuracies. It makes you believe it's intelligent and better than the rest, but I beg to differ on that. The suspense factor was sadly absent from this movie than what ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" delivered. Bad decisions the characters make never pays dividends for their wrong-doings which makes the hero of the story a flawless character. <br/><br/>I liked the movie overall, but in the end it doesn't do me any good because it offers very little to keep me convinced. It offers just as much surrealism like in the first installment. If this keeps up I might just throw in the white towel and not even consider watching another sequel."

","The original ""National Treasure"" was fast-paced and fun all the way through.

This film wasn't as well paced as the original (actually, by the time the lost city was finally found my attention had wandered so many times that I had trouble piecing together the steps that had brought them there!) The basic plot, revolving around the search for this lost city of gold that led from Washington to France to England to South Dakota, wasn't as compelling as the original, either, and to be honest fell on what I considered to be the extremely silly side, the chief silliness being perhaps the account of Gates kidnapping the president to have him help in the treasure hunt.<br/><br/>As for the performances, Nicolas Cage was once again fine as the head treasure hunter Ben Gates, but some of the spark between him and Diane Kruger (again playing Abigail) seemed missing.Justin Bartha added comic relief as Ben's sidekick Riley, as did Jon Voigt as his dad. Helen Mirren and Ed Harris rounded out the cast, as Ben's mom and chief nemesis respectively, and handled their parts well enough.<br/><br/>Basically, I'd characterize this as an average movie with some good action scenes saddled with a plot of limited substance. 5/10"

But when Ben Gates's (Cage) great great grandfathers name appears as one of the assassins who killed Abraham Lincoln. Determined to prove his ancestors innocence Ben and his followers embark on a quest to find the book of secrets.<br/><br/>With it's mediocre story and some half created characters Book of Secret tries but lacks in depth and fullness of a good film. Cage eagerly plays his character but at times slips up into some boredom and irrelevance, especially humour."

","Great fun film. <br/><br/>It's a great story which blends history with myth and legend and there is some great action scenes. As with the first one, there is a ""bad guy"" (the ever excellent Ed Harris) hot on the heels of Cage and Co. as they race to find a hidden treasure. <br/><br/>There is a heavy amount of improbability, but one must push this to the side and believe the legend. Those of a skeptical disposition might not enjoy it. <br/><br/>The whole cast is strong and entertaining and I would say that it is definitely worth watching.

","This film was OK, it was quite enjoyable and a worthy 6/10.<br/><br/>Basically, a treasure hunter is looking for the biggest find of his life. It reminded me of Indiana Jones but not as good!! It was a far fetched story, but then again that is all it was, a fictional story. The film itself was entertaining, I can't say if it was better than the first one but as I haven't seen the first one. It certainly didn't make me want to rush out and watch the first one.<br/><br/>The casting was good and all involved had good parts. Nicholas Cage was especially as good, but he always is. The supporting roles were also well acted. I would have like to have seen more puzzles to be figured out and more often than not the puzzles were solved very quickly. In these kinds of films I like to try to figure out the puzzles in my head as the film is playing, but the solution was often found quickly. The film could have benefited from more suspense.<br/><br/>All in all this film was OK, I wouldn't watch it again but I suggest if you are after something light hearted, entertaining and not to difficult to understand then this one is for you! I particularly liked the French Policemen, the French of often typecast as arrogant and rude which makes me laugh as this isn't at all what they are like in real life!"

Particular one female addition puts some acting weight into the mix, that wasn't available in the first part.<br/><br/>While that is a very good thing, it does stir away from of the better things from part 1!

National Treasure delivered perfectly, and it allows people to understand the movie well without seeing the first film (Though it helps.) Sure, the plot is filled with many historical inaccuracies and stretches of logic, but if you suspend your disbelief, if only just for a moment, it is just an entertaining film.

If the movie producers decided they need to pump another bore fest; they should pump up the action and at least gets some crazy terrorists Nicholas. Shooting RPG's at Cage and his crew should be sufficient with maybe a couple road side bombs going off would be much better than ""scary"" Ed Harris chasing Cage around the Globe.

","National Treasure 2 the Book of Secrets is for the most part a great action adventure film and keeps you enthralled with its twisting corridors, deadly traps, strange conspiracies, and compelling characters. For the most part I actually sat at the edge of my seat wondering where the next clue would take us. However, the movie had one glaring mistake, the writing. First off were lead to believe that Ben's parents had been divorced for 32 years yet in several hours after being reunited they begin acting like they were friends for centuries. The other complaints (Spoilers) are that the city of gold the characters are after is claimed to be built by the Olmecs yet Olmecs were a South American Civilization yet the city was found in North Dakota. Third, why build an underground city of gold in the first place. The idea is basically that the Olmecs carried hundreds of tons of golds across thousands of miles and built an underground city filled with unrealistically intricate traps. Just thinking about that is ludicrous. Fourth, the villain of the movie wants to cause so much danger just because he wants to be remembered. Odd motives to say the least. So in the end the movie despite some major writing mistakes was actually quiet enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a good action adventure flick, who doesn't care about character motives or historical accuracy."

","Our daughter dragged us to see this sequel to National Treasure. I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie and this one, while not as original nor as compelling as the first one, does hold its own. I heard many favorable comments after the lights came up. It was a good popcorn movie wrapped in some real American history, but once the wrapping was removed, it was pure hokum, but isn't that what a movie is supposed to be? An alternative to real life? Wouldn't it be amazing if these treasures really existed and were found? But then I'd have to believe in the Illuminati, the Secrets of the Masons, the Da Vinci Code and Al Gore.

Gee whiz, who would have guessed? It wouldn't be a problem if I didn't think some people were influenced by them. This is a typical sequel. It's got the same sort of things happening to the same cast members and it's a whole lot of fun. Isn't that enough? It's suitable for the whole family, no naked people, curse words, blood or guts, and nothing too scary. It's got an unrelenting pace of adventure and clue solving that gives you less opportunity to go potty than the first film.

","My IMDb comments on the first ""National treasure"" can just about be summed up as ""fairy taleforgettable but enjoyable while you're at it"". This sequel is more of the same.<br/><br/>As an addition to the new genre of puzzle-chasing, not-too-thrilling thriller, NT2 captures the holiday spirit with an injection of family sentiments, by involving now both Ben Gate's (Nicholas Cage) mom and dad, a long-estranged couple brought back together with one thing is common, their love for their dear little boy (to the extent that you can imagine Cage as one).<br/><br/>Same as the first one, this sequel is completely free of sex, violence and obscenity. There is one car chase with minimum shooting. There is the formulaic globe trotting of world-famous spots from Paris' own Statute of Liberty to Buckingham Palace, White House, Mt. Vernon to Mt. Rushmore. The key element this time, in the final analysis, is not treasure but family name. All these are really just to provide the ground for a very impressive cast to act smart, funny, coy, charming, lovable, or all of the above.<br/><br/>The way to enjoy this movie therefore is to love the cast. From the original we have Cage and that's that. Beautiful Diane Kruger is at her best when she flirts with the audience with her witty charm. Justin Bartha continues his role as IT wiz cum royal clown figure. We also have good old Jon Voight as Gate's somewhat eccentric father and Harvey Keitel playing the helpful FBI agent and friend.<br/><br/>A key addition, with the best of credentials, is Helen Mirren, playing Gate's mother, generating some good chemistry with Voight. Villain Sean Bean is now replaced by Ed Harris, looking mildly menacing and winding up as close as possible to becoming a good guy. And then we have the US President, played by who else but Bruce Greenwood. My top choice for the role.<br/><br/>Watch it, and enjoy the cast and holiday season spirit."

","Well Hollywood has done it again. Produced another mediocre action, adventure movie that people will flock to because there's nothing else to see. I thought the first one was much ado about nothing and this second edition follows suit. This movie was dull, dull, dull. All the action was ridiculous especially one long arduous chase with vehicles. Come on now no historian or bad guy can drive that great. The pivotal we're going to die seen was ripe and ready for the video game. Now I/m a history buff and the history wasn't even interesting. And I might be mistaken the movie has a decidedly adult overtone yet there were a lot of kids in the theater I went to and the short before the movie was much too disneyish but again adult oriented.

","For everyone that saw the first National Treasure most of them might remember a feeling of ""Well, i guess that could actually happen"" (American History specialists aside). It's sort of what kept the movie from being over the top and making it an actually decent modern day treasure hunt movie.<br/><br/>National Treasure: Book of Secrets has completely lost that appeal. As the clues develop you realize there's a few where you're think ""Oh, that's kinda clever"" and other's where you just think they can't really be trying that hard. Aside from the fact that they're searching for the Greatest Treasure History Has Ever Known (again), the explanations behind it are kind of weak. Nothing like the decently developed Free Mason's treasure from the Original. Also in parts of this one seem to leave the main story behind to show Ben Gates and Abigal's relationship, where as in the first one they let it clearly but quietly develop in the background of the main plot.<br/><br/>Either way, if you're seeing this for free than go for it. But if you have to pay for it, you're better off just sticking to the first one."

The treasure hunt, though not believable, is gripping. There's also some effective humour added in. Nicolas Cage, who's just one of Hollywood's best actors, is as reliable as ever in the main role of Ben Gates. I don't know what it is about him, but he always manages to be interesting when on screen.<br/><br/>On the downside the film is a Hollywood product. This just isn't great film-making. John Voight and newcomer Helen Mirren are just there for the money. Diane Kruger is nothing but a pretty face, and Ed Harris (who's the villain for most of the film) doesn't have much to do. Still, like I mentioned earlier Book Of Secrets is very entertaining (especially in the second half). I just couldn't stop watching it. It's better than that odd bore Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. Book Of Secrets is a good family film, and I recommend it."

Of course, one has to suspend beliefs that some things can't be done: looking for clues in the Queen of England's office, the Oval Office, and perhaps, the hardest to suspend: kidnapping the President of the United States. But, it all works and quite smoothly, I might add. The pace and the tension are near perfect. There are some drawbacks, however (There you go spoiling things again).<br/><br/>The car chase in London went on for too long and wasn't exciting. Why have it? The water scenes near the end of the movie were confusing, and although I knew what was going on, I couldn't grasp the scheme of the set in the sense I didn't know where everyone was -- not sure the director knew either. <br/><br/>The acting by all was fine, but Harvey Keitel was wasted here. Ed Harris has the face of a good guy and he's made to be the villain and seemed to have trouble with that. ""Hey, he has the face of a good guy, get someone else!""

Nicolas Cage isn't an amazing actor but since he uncannily gets the right movies at the right time, people go out and see his flicks anyway. But you cannot forgive him this time for reprising his role as treasure-seeker Ben Gates in such poorly-written fashion. Diane Kruger as his girlfriend Abigail Chase is still predictably bland when she could've used this opportunity to redeem herself, especially when her character now seems to have a penchant for stating the obvious instead of being the smartie she's supposed to be. But it's hard to hate Justin Bartha as the reliable comic relief Riley Poole, as well as the rest of the cast who seem to just be in this flick for the cash cow that it is.<br/><br/>It all boils down to the shabby writing; seems like the writers were already on strike at this point! Having hinted at a Part 3 (and there haven't been very good Part 3s of the other movie franchises so far), I hope they use it to finally do something more clever and interesting."

When a mysterious man (Ed Harris) shows up at Gates' lecture on Lincoln and the civil war and denigrates a relative of Ben's, Gates is out to prove him wrong. Trouble is, how? Enlisting the help of his father, Patrick (Jon Voight), his estranged girlfriend, Abby (Diane Kruger), his professor mother (Helen Mirren), and the computer-whiz wonderboy, Riley (Justin Bartha), Ben soon learns that the path to clear his ancestor's name will take him down the road of a lost treasure of gold, as well. Traveling to Paris, London and the Black Hills, Ben and company get closer and closer. Ben even ""kidnaps"" the President of the U.S. (Bruce Greenwood) in a grotto near Mount Vernon, but, only to ask him some important questions. But, others may be after the treasure, too, and, now of course, Ben is in trouble with the FBI. Will Ben locate the gold or will he end up in the penitentiary? This is a fun, fun flick with a terrific cast and an exciting story. It's no secret that Cage is one of the top American actors of all time (he's my personal favorite, check out Adaptation, Matchstick Men, and It Could Happen to You, among others) and he commands the attention of all viewers with his charm and energy. Keeping pace, Voight, Mirren, Kruger, and Bartha also give sweet, lovable, humorous performances. Harris is good as the heavy and Greenwood shines as a caring, intelligent President, where do you find one like him? The tale, somewhat implausible, naturally, is brimming with so much history that young fans are certain to head to the library and the Internet to find out what is true and what is imagined.

Instead of trying to find the remaining five pages if they had possibly been removed from the fire; somehow, clues that send them across the world are supposed to save the Gates' from having a smeared history.

I had a look of confusion on my face for the entire time the movie was running. I had no clue how all of this information was supposed to fit together. In the first movie, Ben, Riley, and Abigail give a lot of background information concerning the things they find. However, in this one, barely any information or background ideas are given, making all the history very hard to understand. <br/><br/>*SPOILERS* I did enjoy the addition of Helen Mirren as Emily but Ed Harrison's character seemed so determined and then changed his mind by the end so he'd become the hero.

Not bad at all. Not good either. I don't care about the farfetchedness. I just care about how the story is laid out. It is confusing, really. There are dozens of clues that lead to even more clues and more and more. I thought the first one was a lot but this is the story of number one times two. You're in for a lot of cramming in those two hours. Time went fast though because regardless of how utterly ridiculous the whole thing is, it is a thrill ride. A cinematic thrill ride.<br/><br/>The first one was great. I don't know why I liked it so much but for some reason it hit the spot. It was extremely far-fetched but almost ingenious in a way. It kept my attention throughout the whole thing. This one did too. But with not as much interest in the plot and how it would all resolve. The resolution for number one was good. However, I was not satisfied with how this one ended. Don't ask me why. Maybe it's a psychological thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film's plot is one that can't be described in words, actions, writing, customs or any other form of communication because it is the most convoluted plot since the third 'Pirates' installment. Remember how much difficulty I had with describing that plot? It'll be the same for this. That's why I'm not going to tell you anything but what the previews implied and a few other summaries, etc. etc. Nevertheless, it's the opinion that counts.<br/><br/>What is a good way to summarize the entire convoluted two hour film? Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) is on yet another mission. He's a history nut so he's perfect for the job. The mission is to find out secrets about the assassination of President Lincoln. Things like: Who was involved in the assassination? What lead to it? Why did they choose to cooperate in the plan? But how is that going to happen? About fifteen convoluted clues later, we end up with an unsatisfactory ending that doesn't really prove much except for the main thing in Ben Gates' mind. Was Ben Gates' great-great grandfather Thomas Gates involved in President Lincoln's assassination? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Even after seeing the film I might still have both thoughts. That's what I didn't like. None of the clues really led to anything except more clues and no final result. All that happened just to be lead with another question. Perhaps they did that on purpose. However, the first one ended with not another clue but actually ended well. It was summed up pretty clearly, I think. Plus, it was much more entertaining and not too many plot points were put in to make it more and more confusing.<br/><br/>The movie is still entertaining though. I'll give it that. It takes a LOT of effort to make a feature length film and one that still keeps your attention is worth a positive rating. And I think the way I rated this film was fair. It's right in the middle of average to good. The characters in the film can assist to that. Cage, Voight (playing Patrick Gates, Ben's father), Bartha (the clueless friend Riley), and Kruger (playing the brains of the pack and the woman) are all well-written and entertaining characters. That's another positive note. Helen Mirren (playing Ben's mother) was OK. So was Ed Harris (playing the villain that wants the treasure just as much as Gates). I have a feeling all the writers involved in this film know how ridiculous the premise is. We all do. But they write for fun. They want it to be fun. They want it to be mindless entertainment. But, when you think about it the entertainment is not mindless. You do have to know at least some of what's going on. Otherwise, there's no point in watching the movie.<br/><br/>But I still won't call the film good. It's ridiculous; it's exhausting; it's entertaining; it's convoluted. And they most likely used some formula.<br/><br/>All that comes out to about what my rating is. It's hard to rate a film like this. Because, again, you're not looking for any plausibility at all in a film like this. And if you are you must have been born yesterday or even today.<br/><br/>But the fact that even at the end of the film you don't really feel satisfied but instead feel confused and none of your questions really seemed to be answered.<br/><br/>I felt that way. It's almost like I didn't really see a film. I saw what was more like an idea or tons of ideas plopped into one package. The film is a book of secrets and a book of confusion.<br/><br/>Did you find my review disorganized and convoluted? If you did I'm perfectly fine with that because I know I'm not alone.<br/><br/>Movie directed by Jon Turteltaub."

","Although I have read all of the reviews panning this film because it follows the same ""formula"" as the original and that Justin Bartha's character spouts the ""same tired humor,"" I loved the movie. I thought that all of the actors brought more depth to their characters than they did in the first movie. <br/><br/>I adore Justin Bartha's deadpan humor and thought that Nicolas Cage, Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel did an incredible job. The additions of Ed Harris and Helen Mirren brought a new dynamic to the film and I really enjoyed learning about the relationship between Jon Voight an Helen Mirren's characters. I thought the plot was intriguing, the dialogue was stimulating and the action exciting.<br/><br/>I will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD"

","This movie was way too similar to the first. If not for Riley's added humor, this movie would not have even been worthy of renting. For example, in one of the final scenes, when they find the treasure, they light up a path just like in the first movie. Also, the actual action did not even start until three-fourths of the movie was over. If the second was this bad, I hope there will not be a third. They should of stopped while they were ahead. Do not waste your money on this movie while it is in theaters; wait until it is on DVD. Instead, save your money to go see Indiana Jones in May. And, while you are waiting for Indiana Jones 4, watch episodes of 24 and Monk, which are well worth your money."
"filipemanuelneto","4","1","2","28 February 2017"," Repeating the recipe of the first movie: entertainment, crazy conspiracy theories and historical untruths.
","This movie is the sequel of ""National Treasure"" and is just another movie about insane conspiracy theories based on false historical premises. This time, everything revolves around Cibola, a variation of the South American myth of El Dorado. Out of curiosity, there is no pre-Columbian ruin in North America with some minimal similarity to the one showed in the film, at least as far as I know. What it portrays is clearly influenced by ruins lefted by the Mayans, Aztecs or Incas, who lived in more southern latitudes. That, and the crazy theory around the Resolute desks, is enough to make the plot absolutely indigestible for anyone with a minimum of historical knowledge. The cast includes many actors from the first film, with Nicholas Cage and Diane Kruger leading the way and keeping the flaws and virtues shown earlier, like the lack of depth and personality of their characters and some very enjoyable comical vein. Ed Harris was effective in the role of villain and managed to counteract the lack of depth of the other characters. The film still has good visual and special effects, although scenarios are sometimes a bit disappointing or unrealistic."
"ivo-cobra8","9","1","2","29 September 2016"," Underrated gem solid, unfair criticized, a decent well made the last good Nicolas Cage movie sequel!
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007) it is unfairly criticized and trashed by critics and fans of the first film. My honest opinion is: this is the last good Nicolas Cage movie he has done, before he start making direct to video trash movies. Nicolas Cage returns with his famous character Ben Franklin Gates. I forgot to mentioned in the first film review Nicolas reunited with producer Jerry Bruckheimer for the fifth time in the row producing this film. The first film with Nicolas Cage was The Rock (1996) on which the actor and producer worked together. I disagree with people saying this was unnecessary sequel, it is a good sequel and I love this film, but I don't love it that much as I love the first movie! The first movie is the best one of the two, Nicolas Cage also reunites with Ed Harris from The Rock (1996). Ed Harris plays again another villain and I must say for my honest opinion Ed Harris is way better villain than Sean Bean is in the first film. I was really surprised how much fun I had with this film, you also do have a lot's of action and car chases. We have returning cast from the first movie: Nicolas Cage, Justin Bartha, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel and Armando Riesco.<br/><br/>Plot: Benjamin Gates must follow a clue left in John Wilkes Booth's diary to prove his ancestor's innocence in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>I don't know what is the problem with this film I think it is a good film and I really like the character development, but still is not better than the first film. The first film is still way better than this one. This film is about clearing Ben Gates ancestor's name and innocence that he wasn't co conspirator in assassination of US president Abraham Lincoln and that he was set up, before he died and was killed. It references on Abraham Lincoln US president that was assassinated and it is again a history film. This film doesn't evolves around museums like was in the first movie but it evolves about a book that leads to a clues.<br/><br/>I love National Treasure 2. It's funny, gripping and informative. This film is the American history in the plot story, which is surprisingly accurate. Its nice to see a film that shows respect to it's story and doesn't reinvent it and destroy it completely. Its also nice to see a sequel that hasn't been rushed. I absolutely enjoyed this film on Blu-ray. I bought this film together on Blu-ray with the first film and I have absolutely enjoy it and I had fun with it. Con Air, The Rock and National Treasure 1 and 2 are my favorite Nicolas Cage movies and are favorite of mine that I can watch them over and over again and they aren't that violent like are Face/Off, Left Behind, Windtalkers films I seriously hate that movies that Nicolas Cage was involved!<br/><br/>Things I do like in the film: the end when Ed Harris sacrifice him self to save all the people trapped in a cave. Nicolas Cage clearing his ancestor's name and for the discovery of a secret also gives a credit to Ed Harris. In the caves you have a lot of booby traps. Nicolas Cage and Diane Kruger's character development was excellent specially their fight in the museum. Helen Mirren is also cast as Ben Gates mom a professor on the university that Jon Voight's character don't get along with it, but on the end of the film, they both show their feelings and that they are still in love. Showing our beloved heroes in a caves was fantastic, Ben Gates kidnapping American President in a secret passage so that president tells him the secret clue hiding in library's book was brilliant. This film is brilliant and excellent so I don't get the hate for this film! Helen Mirren as Ben Gates mom was excellent in her role, she also played in Red 1 and 2 and Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999) I mostly know her from those movies. Everything in this movie is excellent, special effects and mostly the characters are wonderful that I love.<br/><br/>The director Jon Turteltaub did an amazing job on this movie! It is just as exciting as the first one, but is a whole new story, and a whole new adventure to go on. Trevor Rabin reprise the score theme from the first movie which is solid.<br/><br/>Overall: I love Natural Treasure 2 it is Nicolas Cage last good movie he done and my favorite of the actor, the rating is A+ 9/10 a good sequel but not that great as the first one, but still a fun watchable flick.<br/><br/>National Treasure: Book of Secrets (released on home video as National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets) is a 2007 mystery adventure film directed by Jon Turteltaub and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.

","National Treasure: Book of Secrets, is a decent action film that suffers from the inevitable decease that it has to follow a top notch action adventure movie NT 1. <br/><br/>The writers of this one must have had some difficulties setting up the plot, because more than once are there scenes taken almost directly from the first one, though set in Paris or London this time around. Especially the whole plot revolving the villain is almost copy-pasted from the original, however, the writers just never get around to explaining Wilkinson(the villain)properly, and it results in his switching around from bad guy to good guy three or four times during the last 45 min. An example of this is that he apologizes for smearing Ben Gates' great-great grand dad and five minutes later he holds a blade to Diane Kruger throat if he isn't allowed to leave the horrible booby traps first.<br/><br/>Also, Ben Gates, who in the first one really showed his skill as a treasure hunter using only his brain, seems to get a lot of help from the writers to suddenly realise the nature of his quest, without really having to put an effort into it. <br/><br/>The movie seems to have been made in order to make a quick buck, as the first was a huge success, the execs (Bruckheimer) and director Jon Turteltaub do not seem to have made much effort in telling a cohesive story, but seem more engaged in selling tickets."

"Sascha71","4","1","2","29 August 2008"," The Book of how to Overdo a Plot
","OK, I am a huge fan of adventure and treasure hunting movies. I love the Indiana Jones's, the Quartermains and I have read every single Dan Brown book despite he won't be winning a Literature Nobel Prize anytime soon.<br/><br/>I loved the first National Treasure movie, too. It had just the right mix of an actual believable plot, action and romance you expect from any good adventure movie.<br/><br/>So, I bought the second one on DVD and expected a bit more of the same. But after finishing it, I can't help but wonder what happened to Hollywood's screenwriters these days. <br/><br/>To be honest, I think a big part of the problem is the (wrong) attitude of some Hollywood executives that sequels always have to top their own predecessors. A plot that was barely believable in the first movie will be utterly ridiculous in the second one. It's what happened with Pirates of the Caribbean, too. The first one was just great, the second a bit overdone, the third just ridiculous. <br/><br/>I can't even try to begin describing how ridiculous NT2's plot is compared to the first movie. The movie starts actually in a promising manner. We're being witness to the assassination of Lincoln, where one of Gates's ancestors is involved (he is forced to analyze a secret code). Back in the present, said ancestor is being connected with the assassination itself, leaving Gates with the urge to clean up his family honor. So far so good - and from here on, the plot goes downhill. <br/><br/>A selection of what happens, written from Gates's perspective: <br/><br/>1. We have to break into Buckingham Palace (that's easy, the Queen can't afford good security) and fumble around with the Queen's Desk(!) to retrieve a clue to the treasure. <br/><br/>2. My ex-girlfriend conveniently appears(!) and helps me committing this little crime (I still wonder why she did that too, since she had next to no motivation for it, her being mad at me and all)<br/><br/>3. My sidekick need only mere seconds to break into the Palace's security system and open doors, set off fire alarms etc. (I am glad to notice that he used Apple computers to do that - I really need to buy one too, if they can do things like that). <br/><br/>4. The bad guy appears and he and I engage in a wild car chase (yes, a car chase - really original, no movie before NT2 ever had one) through half of London (no, there never are traffic jams in central London, so driving there at 100mph is not an issue). <br/><br/>5. I decide that I have to give the bad guys the artifact to get rid of them. But I need to copy the inscriptions first, of course. No problem, since we're driving at 100mph, the next traffic camera will be ready to make a nice photo of the artifact if we only hold it to the windscreen. And we still have our computer whizkid who can hack the police database in 5 seconds to retrieve the photo. <br/><br/>6. Ugh, we need a second artifact now - which is in another desk: This time in the Oval Office. Oh well, we might just break in there while we're at it (the president can't afford good security either, by the way). <br/><br/>7. Alright, a slight problem appears: The artifact is gone from the president's desk. But, hey, the solution is obvious: We just need to kidnap the president (that's not hard, since we already know that he can't afford good security). <br/><br/>8. Problem solved: We just kidnapped the president and since he's a very nice and understanding person he isn't even mad at us for doing so. And since I asked so nicely, he's even willing to let us have the Book of Secrets. Usually only presidents are supposed to see that, but there is always the exception for a polite kidnapper. <br/><br/>9. Tadaa, the name-giving Book of Secrets has its appearance. Only for like a minute or so, though. The bloody police is arriving and I can't even look up who murdered Kennedy! <br/><br/>10. OK, the rest is very easy: My mother is one of the very few persons in the world to know the ancient South American language on those artifacts, so she can translate the inscriptions (aren't we a great family?). <br/><br/>11. It turns out the lost Inca Golden City ended up under Mt. Rushmore (no wonder nobody found it in South America - who carried it up here anyway?). <br/><br/>12. The rest is even easier. After defeating a ridiculous looking trap and tricking the bad guy into getting himself drowned (haha, this guy actually thought I'd keep my word!), we secured the Golden City for my country. I am happy that there was more value in there than in the last pile of jewelry I found. I had to outdo myself, after all. <br/><br/>13. The best thing of all is that my girlfriend wants me to move in with her again. I am sure her tossing me out of our house was just a misunderstanding. Not sure why the screenwriter insisted that she did that in the first place.<br/><br/>Am I really the only one who finds this plot to be slightly inconsistent and overdone?<br/><br/>That all being said, this movie still isn't a complete waste. But you definitely have to switch off your brain while watching it, otherwise it might fry while trying to figure out the logic behind the plot. Because there is none."

Guess you were too distracted by the mountains of cash that were dumped on your mansion. Anyhow, this film is absolutely inane. Most of the history on display here is either false or unbelievable. The only positives I can think of are some of the action sequences, and even those felt contrived and boring, and the acting by Jon Voight and Helen Mirren, their banter was hilarious. Overall, I would say just watch a real adventure movie over this garbage. At least Indiana Jones does not totally insult your intelligence."
"fwomp","3","1","2","6 July 2008"," Umm ...How Did Finding The Treasure Clear The Gates Family Name?
","I admit that watching the first NATIONAL TREASURE movie was a guilty pleasure, but here ends my enjoyment of anything National or Treasure. Sequels are tough to pull off (can anyone say ""INDIANA JONES 4?"") and one has to wonder why Hollywood continues to pump them out even when the script fails on almost every level ...and such was the case with National Treasure 2.<br/><br/>If anyone can tell me how finding this new treasure helped solve the Gates family's problem related to their relatives' association with the Lincoln assassination, please let me know. Because that was what this film was all about, right? I mean, we start off with Thomas Gates (Joel Gretsch, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) being approached by the men who set up President Lincoln's assassination, who in turn kill Thomas for refusing to give up the secrets to an ancient language in a document they have. We then move on to the current day where this document comes to the attention of the Gates family by the sinister Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) who presents his evidence that Thomas Gates was the mastermind behind Lincoln's death. So Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage, GHOST RIDER), his father Patrick (Jon Voight, TRANSFORMERS), Ben's estranged wife Abigail (Diane Kruger) and Ben's trusty friend and sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha, FAILURE TO LAUNCH) head out to clear the family name by finding the lost treasure of pre-America. But how, exactly, this will clean-up their family name isn't clear ...or even explained. A pretty big hole in the story's central plot.<br/><br/>This plot hole combined with everything we've already seen in the previous NATIONAL TREASURE film makes this second installment tedious and full of non-surprises.<br/><br/>The only positive spin the film can claim is Justin Bartha's Riley character who infuses almost all of the comedy by having a monopoly on the best lines (""Ben, if it were you trying to convince me, you'd have less evidence and I'd already believe you by now."").<br/><br/>But that's it. Even the dastardly character Mitch Wilkinson (Harris) doesn't stay dastardly; only moments before he turns ""good"" he was holding a knife to Ben's mother's neck (Helen Mirren, THE QUEEN), making his character completely unbelievable now. Gah! National Treasure 2 is a true disaster, with such poor characterization and plotting that it makes the entire film feel like it's laced with fool's gold with nary a piece of treasure in sight."

","Surprisingly Nicolas Cage's acting isn't the worst thing in this film. The lacklustre script, unnecessarily over patriotic ideology of the characters and utterly absurd storyline claim ownership to the main reasons this is certainly a film to miss. Despite going in with low expectations having not liked the first one very much, i still found myself disappointed when I left the cinema.<br/><br/>However its not all bad as there are humorous parts and some well connected historical points, but they are too few and far between to give this film any substance. Justin Bartha (Riley Poole) once again gives a convincing portrayal of the awkward third wheel. But neither of these justify sitting through the 90 other percent of rubbish.<br/><br/>I would have to give this a generous 4/10, and certainly wont be recommending it to anyone I like."
"cchase","7","1","2","10 June 2008"," No ""Strain On The Brain""...
","Okay, first things first: Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and the right to vigorously express that opinion, especially when it comes to movies, and definitely here at this site. Having said that, no one can tell me with a straight face that they had no idea what they were getting themselves into, when they went to a theater to see or rented NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS. I mean, c'mon. Like its predecessor, it's a WALT Disney FILM, co- produced by JERRY BRUCKHEIMER. If you were expecting THE GODFATHER or LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, you should've gone to the video store and rented one or both of them.<br/><br/>Just like the first TREASURE, it's another preposterous knockoff of the INDIANA JONES films set in post-modern times, without the grit and gravitas of Harrison Ford. (No offense to Nic Cage, but it's HARRISON FORD!) And like a 2-D version of a Disney theme park ride, this is not meant to stimulate the deep-thinking portions of your frontal lobe, parietal lobe or cerebral cortex whatsoever. Pleasure centers ONLY, people. The bombastic, ridiculous plot points wash over you, including all the leaps in logic and plot holes the size of Jupiter. You won't remember most of what happened two hours after seeing this anyway. I certainly didn't.<br/><br/>All you need to know is this: Cage is back as Benjamin Franklin Gates, and now he's determined to clear the Gates family name when an opportunistic fortune hunter (Ed Harris), floats the theory that Ben's great-great grandfather was one of the group of conspirators who aided and abetted John Wilkes Booth in the Lincoln assassination. Mirth, mayhem, vigorous chases through several different locales in various countries ensues, and none of it is too exciting or too threatening for the kiddies. In other words - all the earmarks of your typical Disney blockbuster.<br/><br/>There is some continuity, at least. Jon Voight and Justin Bartha return as Ben's dad and his trusty, put-upon sidekick, respectively. Diane Kruger returns as Ben's now-estranged lady friend and partner in treasure-hunting. (And at least her American accent has gotten a little bit better). Ed Harris is fittingly menacing - a role he seems to specialize in these days - so it's kind of a jolt when his character does a '180' at a certain point (you'll know when that is.) And though I could watch Helen Mirren pull weeds out of her garden, I'm surprised to see her here as Ben's mother, (though she is still terrific.) <br/><br/>Plus, we get a HUGE red flag I have learned to spot in any movie that features any kind of political intrigue or drama. In WHAT UNIVERSE, for Christ's sake, would the U.S. President ever be a man as handsome, well-spoken and laden with integrity as Bruce Greenwood? EXACTLY. Anytime I see him and he's playing the Commander-In-Chief, my ""Uh-Oh"" Meter zings into the red. <br/><br/>And that's not even mentioning the whole linking the Statue of Liberty, the Library of Congress and matching Resolute Desks in the US and England to Mt. Rushmore and the legend of the city of Cibola thing. (DON'T ASK.)<br/><br/>So this NATIONAL TREASURE sequel is not a great movie. It may not even be a GOOD movie as far as most rational-thinking movie-watching adults are concerned. But I have wasted two hours on a lot worse films than this. And did I happen to mention it's got HELEN MIRREN???"

That was in 1865. The message is interpreted as referring to the Statute of Liberty and revised to mean an earlier version done by the same sculptor and located in Paris. Another clue on a model of the statue in Paris leads to more clues and so on until they find the vastly geographically displaced remnant of an Indian culture (as others point out).<br/><br/>Trouble is, Lady Liberty had not even been designed yet in 1865. Check the Wikipedia entry for Statue of Liberty. The first model was built in 1870.

The Resolute was not decommissioned until 1889 and the gift of a desk to the American president was made in 1890.<br/><br/>These are hardly the only historical errors in a movie that makes a pretense toward turning on historical facts.

","This is the second time that I've reviewed this film. IMDb, you lost my first one, so I am having to write this from memory. Fortunately, my opinion of the film hasn't changed.<br/><br/>As a non-American, I am constantly amazed at that country's ability to mythologize and almost deify its history and iconic figures. American nationalism has a streak of idolatry about it that enables films like NTBOS to be created. Americans know that they live in a Great Power, and are able to create stories to celebrate it, even something as lighthearted as this.<br/><br/>NTBOS is essentially a video game with a narrative follow-though. It is Indiana Jones set in the modern day, but reducing the world to that contained within American boarders, something that many Americans find deeply comforting.<br/><br/>A central theme in this film (and the authors have the decency to give some depth to the proceedings) is the place in history of ones actions, and the connection to the past through one's relatives, and the bequeathing of moral responsibility from one generation to the next.<br/><br/>This film is a quest myth, and like all good quests, what is sought is potentially ennobling to the questors. And all the characters, even the putative villain portrayed by Ed Harris, seek merely to make a positive contribution, and to be remembered well, achieving immortality in the process.<br/><br/>The acting isn't great in this film, and it doesn't have to be: the actors merely have to look like they are having fun whilst Jon Turtletaub puts them through their paces and pays them a lot of money whilst doing it. I don't think they are acting though. Since Nick Cage can't act, what we are left with is genuine enthusiasm and enjoyment that is readily transferred to the paying audience. A fine entertainment!"

The London car chase was shabbily staged (the implausibilities were glaring). Helen Mirren as Ben's mom could have been as much fun as Sean Connery as Indiana Jones's dad, but we get a three-decade-old luggage tiff to introduce her....

And Nicolas Cage is much less unpredictable and inspired than in the past. (Check out ""Vampire's Kiss"".) The best part of the movie was the whole kidnapping of the President scene with that terrific actor Bruce Greenwood. And those gorgeous interior shots of the Library of Congress made this bibliophile's heart race. Diane Kruger is loveliest and funniest in the Oval Office scene. Next time out, give her more a share of the subterfuges, and bring back Greenwood's President for a story revolving around page 47."

","I would actually give this films 6.8 out of 10. It's better than a 6 not good enough for a 7. This is a fun, family film with Nicolas Cage returning as the decipher of government secret hidden in public views. This time, its about clearing his family name as some guy comes up and claims his family was part of the group that conspired to kill Abe Lincoln.<br/><br/>The cool thing about this film is that it makes you believe that all t his stuff could be possible. That if you look at a dollar bill closely, look at the constitution closely, you would find stuff their that was hidden for anybody to decipher. The film takes you around the world and back again in it's Indiana-Jones like action adventure. It's like Goonies for Grownups. And if you like Goonies, you will like National Treasure. It's not complicated, its not a serious political thriller. Its the right film at the right time when you don't want to see another fake biopic (dewey cox), or the Oscar contenders. When you want to see a film that reminds you of summer past blockbuster, go see National Treasure. Nothing new, nevertheless entertaining."

","Yes, it is action packed.<br/><br/>Yes the characters are our same likable ones from the previous film. Ms. Mirren is an excellent addition to the cast.<br/><br/>It is the story which stank. The acting was great. All of the action packed adventure requited for such a film. <br/><br/>However, the script could have been much better. The storyline did not have as much thought as far as reviewing clues and coming up with the historical background and resolutions. This should normally make up 80% of the film but not this time. <br/><br/>If they do make a sequel to this film, I hope they bring back the original writers."

","NT2 contains some of what made NT1 so much fun, but is missing some key elements.<br/><br/>**BEYOND THIS THERE BE SPOILERS**<br/><br/>First, I got plot questions: Why doesn't Booth know how to decode his own coded letter when he even has the key? Why is the KGC subplot dropped from the film after the first half hour? Why doesn't Ben Gates have any cred with the powers that be after finding the world's biggest treasure in the first movie? He still has to sneak around and break into everything. (answer - so Riley can be a character in the movie) Why does his ex-girlfriend have the huge mansion? She didn't buy it, and they weren't married. And after all the jumping through hoops, why is Thomas Gates listed in Booth's diary as ""mastermind?"" If they explained, I missed it, and that explanation was what the whole thing was supposedly about. I guess these are minor.<br/><br/>What I really miss from part one is the appreciation of history. The most interesting characters in the film (Lincoln, Booth, Albert Pike, Queen Victoria) are little more than passing thoughts here. Nothing as grand as those opening montages in NT1, showing the origin of the treasure, the legend, the only surviving clue, etc. There is a scene of the Lincoln assassination, and it's one of the best things in the film. For two minutes. <br/><br/>There is also a very good car chase and a good deathtrap before the final discovery which was borrowed from the Republic serial Manhunt in the African Jungle, IIRC. <br/><br/>The performances are uniformly good, except maybe for Diane Kruger, whose German accent is much more noticeable than in the first installment. (I know, she looks good, so that cancels it out.)<br/><br/>Speaking of looking good, Cage's hair stylist has failed him royally on this one and should never be hired by him again. It's only three years since the last installment and he looks like 10 years before the mast/5 miles of bad road. Bad cut, bad color. He is a major movie star, people, can you help the man out for heaven's sake?<br/><br/>Still, the movie is fun and funny, fast paced and clean, and worth the price of admission if you're looking for some escapist fun."

","Below I just sat down with the kids this afternoon and watched the DVD of National Treasure: The Book of Secrets, and I was utterly charmed by the whole thing. The villain's motives are a little shaky in logic, but hey, that's a common problem with movie villains anyway. But I was struck by how much better and how much more entertaining this film was than Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, especially since both movies are basically in search of the same goal: the city of gold. Frankly, National Treasure 2 was simply a better telling of the story, far more believable, and far more entertaining. Sure, Indy's got its charm because of the actors and style, but having seen Indy in the theater and National Treasure on DVD, I wish the reverse were true. I'd've loved to have seen National Treasure on the big screen, and I'd've waited until Indy was on DVD to see it."

","OK, so I have to admit, after the reviews it was with a certain amount of trepidation that I entered my local monopolised flea-pit. However, it just goes to show that sometimes these film reviewers a) haven't seen the film at all or b) maybe aren't as clever as they suppose themselves to be. The plot hangs together surprisingly well, and there is enough in the way of action scenes (particularly with the car chases) to keep you engaged. I also enjoyed how Voigt and Mirren played off each other as the couple who have wasted decades hating each other. As good as the first one? No - BETTER! If you want to hear Nic Cage singing 'I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts' in a mock cockney accent, then this is the film for you. Enjoy!"

The sequel is better. It doesn't need the character development of the first since we know the characters.. although it does add some fresh faces with two new roles played by powerhouses Ed Harris and Helen MIrren. I found 'book of Secrets' to be more of what made the original a good popcorn flick. Don't expect dramatic roles....don't expect a controversial ending... expect what you got the first time around only a bit better... If you were split on the first one give this a view.

The tech support guy is nearly cartoon as is the disappointing villain until some inconsistent changes at the end.<br/><br/>The other support cast is where the better writing and acting happens especially Mom and Dad -- sort of like how Sean Connery stole the last Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Big plot holes: all the clues point to specific things that didn't exist and mostly weren't planned at the point the clue was created."
"rajdoctor","6","1","3","20 January 2008"," The National Treasure 2
","I did not see the first part of the movie, but being Nicholas Cage's fan, I went to see this one.<br/><br/>The story is about treasure hunter Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) who unravels the pages of missing dairy of the killer of Abrahim Lincoln to find out the secret leading to the hidden treasure of gold. The movie opens with the shooting of Lincoln and then re-opens in today's times when Ben with the help of - nerdy geek friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), his girl friend Abigali Chase (Daine Kruger), his father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) and his mother Prof. Emily Appelton (Helen Mirren)  solve the mystery. There is also a villain Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) who is also behind the treasure. There are lots of chase scenes, moments of comedy, suspense, thrill  that leads them to Luxembourg Garden in Paris, the statue of Liberty, Birmingham Palace in London, the White House, the Mount Rushmore and below that the hidden underground gold treasure. In the end villain dies and the treasure is given to the US government.<br/><br/>The movie is a typical commercial venture in the lines of James Bond and Indiana Jones movies with enough comedy, stunts, chase, geeks and good acting. Nicholas Cage looks haggard with his age, Daine Krugner looks good and at times reminds of south Indian heroine Simran, Helen Mirren and Jon Voight try to do justice to their small roles, but the scene stealer is Ed Harris in his small villainy role.<br/><br/>The movie has its fun moments. The last action scenes is shot underground (mostly in a studio set) on a hinge platform, and I think that could have been made much more enthralling with greater variety of stunt (how we miss Steven Spielberg to do all that for us). This movie falls short to deliver the same rush of blood as Indiana Jones series, but is though enough to entertain oneself.<br/><br/>(Stars 6.25 out of 10)"

","After seeing the first film I was more or less looking forward to a sequel. There was enough ground to make one on after all. And it must be said, this film is slightly worse than its predecessor, but only slightly and that means it is still a very enjoyable film.<br/><br/>Storywise one can expect the same kind of thing that made the first film: a trail of clues leading to some great lost treasure. In this film the clues are even more far-fetched than the ones in the first film, but not to the point of being irritating. The rest of things in the film is very much in line with the other as well. Just about all the characters return and play their part well.<br/><br/>The few characters that get added to the mix work out well enough and that makes the grand total for this adventure a well deserved 7 out of 10. No work of art, but surely worthy of cinema time.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 lost artifacts"

","In action movie series its rare that the sequel is as good or better than the original but this is just as good as National Treasure.<br/><br/>Again we have lots of puzzles, hidden maps and travelling this time all over the world to find The Lost City Of Gold just to clear the name of Ben's great great grandfather who has been accused of being the mastermind behind the assassination of President Lincoln.<br/><br/>Ideas that places like The Oval Office in The White House and The Queen's Private Chambers in Buckingham Palace would be so easy to gain access to are totally laughable and unrealistic, likewise the shelves of The Library Of Congress.<br/><br/>Some suspension of belief is required there, well a huge amount actually. Once again Ben is being pursued by bad people (Ed Harris playing a mercenary very badly). The locations are excellent, the action is slightly over the top. Casting Helen Mirren as Ben's mum is a stroke of genius, her scenes with John Voight are all totally brilliant and improve the film a great deal.<br/><br/>It's quite funny seeing John Voight playing a former treasure hunter here especially as that was his role in Tomb Raider as Lara Croft's father.<br/><br/>The film is very watchable and I'm sure there are lots of little things you will spot if you watch it more than once so it can definitely stand up to multiple viewings. Hopefully the next one in the series will be just as good, I guess it just depends what was on Page 47? <br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Yes, it has actually facts. Yes it's a children's movie. Yes it's a sequel. And yes, it's amazing. National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets may be the first ever sequel that could do well on it's own. Although the movie isn't as jokey and funny as it's predecessor, it still is worthy of a ""two thumbs up"" by those two men we all love. Abigal is seeing other men so we also have relationship problems too. So much for a Disney movie, and with a heroic ending everything is just awesome. We even have the guns out again, although there is about a twenty min. car chase that could have been minimized down to about five. Riley finally meets his special someone too. At first we think it'll be a little different because Riley is constantly being overshadowed by Ben, and the Ferrari gets taken away. The perfect day."

It was a great popcorn loving film; however, like the first one, the story was unbelievable and unrealistic. It was interesting, but I couldn't help but find it all silly. Nonetheless, I liked the two hour diversion. I can now see these movies as the modern-day generation of the next Indiana Jones'. 8/10 There's evidence at the end of this movie that there could very well be a third National Treasure.

The first 5 minutes or so, I was thinking to myself, gosh this is starting out like Ghost busters II!. Then, it started to roll and roll it did. If you are a fan of the Indiana Jones series, it was similar to the 2nd of that franchise. It's really hard for a sequel to make the same impact as the first one, and this movie fell a little short in that all of the things that were likable in the first one were present in the second, but it wasn't new anymore. Ed Harris gives his usual solid performance, and all of the principal characters of the first movie are there in the 2nd with one or two pleasant additions. I dare to hope for National Treasure 3!!.

It made perfect sense to someone that actually watched it and was able to understand it.<br/><br/>The move started out showing the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. It includes how Thomas Gates got involved. Then we move to current time and as Nicolas Cage, a professor was giving the history lesson and speaking on behalf of his ancestors, Ed Harris' character speaks up and says that he has proof that it is all a lie and that Thomas Gates was one of the people involved in the assassination of AL.<br/><br/>The whole story made sense.<br/><br/>The book of secrets, it had relevance because of the missing artifacts.<br/><br/>The whole movie was in perfect order and yes, there was humor, but not immature humor. It went well with the characters and showed a relationship amongst them.<br/><br/>I love movies like this. Where one puzzle leads you to another and NT picked up from it's original and the second did it's call of duty. It even left a possibility of a trilogy.<br/><br/>Even in one moment, it had me tear up a little.

","Sometimes you just want to see a film to be entertained and distracted from the boredom of everyday life, and National Treasure: BoS proves to be that distraction, a no-brainer which mixes some real history (the Resolute desks) with a lost world under Mount Rushmore, a professor in ancient languages (Helen Mirren) who has a love-hate relationship with her ex (Jon Voight), a vain writer (Nicholas Cage), descendant of an American Civil War hero and ex boyfriend of a 'New Woman', and lots of trips around the world to England, France ... oh, and a car chase with guns.<br/><br/>It does what it says on the tin and is never boring. Clearly this would never happen in real life (the President is a lot more clever than Mr B for a start) but as an engaging saga, it fits the bill.

That was really funny to see the somewhat serious Ben acting like a drunk idiot! I really loved the Gold City too. I don't really get though why Abby would kick Ben out of HIS house, but at least he moves in again at the end. My favorite part I think is when Riley finds his car being towed and he starts chasing after it. That'd be really bad to have your Red Ferrari towed and having to pay six million bucks for it.

The plot for this sequel, however, is really quite original. It takes the characters on an entirely new adventure without having to recycle the plot points from the first film in the series.<br/><br/>The scene atop Mount Rushmore reminds me of Cary Grant's Spy Classic, ""North By Northwest,"" and then morphs into an Indiana Jones-style adventure. We also get to see the sights, outside AND in, from Paris, to London, to Washington, D.C.<br/><br/>The actors are also A-list, as opposed to other films that might only have one or two A-listers.

"orglit1","7","1","4","24 December 2007"," Secret Elitist Elements in ""Treasure""
","Although they exhibit insightful interpretation of code language, the writers made many decisively elitist choices that fail Disney's promise to serve the public interest. The heroes of this movie are jet-setter multimillionaires or billionaires. They could have been persons of ordinary income, with minor adjustments to the plot. So many American movies focus on the experiences of the topmost income earners as if to say that theirs are the most interesting lives. The affluent heroes claim their desire to solve the mystery is to clear up their family name, a name that is followed in the news media, that originates centuries ago. That is pure poppycock because here, in America, we don't have a nobility, we don't have persons strutting superiority over the peasants on the basis of family plumage, crest, shield. The writers must be anticipating the imminent demise of the inheritance tax, which many Republicans sought to entirely extricate from federal law in our recent past. Then, these valiant heroes cause horrible damage and injury to ordinary populations where they engage in car chases. No punishment is even feared. But when one of them detains the President for a few minutes, even though the President was pleased that it happened, there are these overlong deliberations about the harm to that V.I.P. and the punishment that might be meted out. If the film was intended to be realistic, how do heroes engage in highly destructive car chases without fear of lawsuits for negligence and reckless driving? Or if it is a fantasy, why do the audiences have to be treated to scenes of large fleets of police cars chasing down these heroes as if they were criminals just for having spoken of interesting things privately to the President? It's consistent with the return of a nobility to depict damage to peasants as trivial. Setting aside this objection, this movie is fun to watch, in good taste, and thought-provoking. But nobility is the family value Disney is promoting with ""National Treasure""."

It's still a great movie to watch, one the whole family can enjoy, but as with most hits, the sequels don't usually nail it quite the same. The ""gee whiz, I didn't know that"" about history is still there (3 Liberty Ladies?), along with the likable characters (Riley is the best sidekick, and the main reason I went), and the intelligent plot, as well the stellar performances. Yet, it came off a little flat overall. I still didn't understand Ed Harris's role as a villain. Sean Bean was a great villain, one with ingenuity and cunning. Harris seemed only functionary.

","When I first saw National Treasure, I was blown away. With the complex puzzle solving and action violence, it was an unexpectedly refreshing movie from Disney. Such is the case of NT's sequel.<br/><br/>Many critics complain that the storyline is almost exactly like the first film, but this is not entirely true. The film centers around finding a national treasure, but the motives, minor characters, and plot development are different. All the cast is back (except for villain Sean Bean, who's character is in prison), with the lovely additions of Ed Harris as the main villain and Oscar-winning Helen Mirren as Ben Gates' mother.<br/><br/>Traveling from Paris to London to South Dakota, the three heroes look for clues to help clear the Gates' name of assisting in the Lincoln assassination.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the movie was very decent.

"veritasbulldog","1","0","1","16 June 2020"," Sickening Lincoln worship.
","The movie is bad. I mean shockingly bad. It is filled with ridiculous Lincoln worship. Ben Gates even says Lincoln was the one to change how the United States was arranged, saying he made it to where the United States 'are' became the United States 'is'. This is so unbelievably wrong in so many ways. He is correct that Lincoln's war did this, but he fails to mention how this destroyed the Federal Union of the Founders and that the States were never meant to be one nation, but a Union of free, sovereign, independent States. Article 7 of the Constitution explains that the document was to be ratified by the ""free and independent states,"" as they are called in the Declaration of Independence. The union of the founders was voluntary, and several states reserved the right to withdraw from the union in the future if it became destructive of their rights. Since each state has equal rights in the union, this became true for all states. That is why, at the outset of the Civil War, the overwhelming majority of Northern newspapers editorialized in favor of peaceful secession. Most of them quoted Jefferson from the Declaration saying that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and when that consent is withdrawn it is the peoples' duty to abolish that government and form a new one.<br/><br/>Lincoln thus destroyed the voluntary union of the founding fathers and replaced it with a Soviet-style coerced union held together with the threat of total war waged on the civilian population of any state in the future that attempted to make Jefferson's argument and act on it. It is telling that on the eve of the Civil War several federal laws were proposed to outlaw secession. This occurred because everyone at the time understood that secession was perfectly legal and constitutional. No less a figure than James Madison, the Father of the Constitution, explained in Federalist 39 that the Constitution was to be ratified by the people ""not as individuals composing one entire nation, but as composing the distinct and independent States to which they respectively belong"" (emphasis added). He also stated that the federal government gets all of its authority from the sovereign states and not the ""whole people."" The ""whole people"" who resided in the states stretching from Maine to Georgia at the time had nothing at all to do with the ratification of the Constitution. It was ratified by state political conventions (not state legislatures). Madison continued on to say that each state ratifying the Constitution ""is considered as a sovereign body, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary act.""<br/><br/>Virginia, New York and Rhode Island specifically reserved the right to withdraw from the Union if it ever became ""destructive of our liberties."" Here's what the Virginia delegation to the Constitutional Convention put in writing:<br/><br/>We the delegates of the people of Virginia . . . Do, in the name and behalf of the people of Virginia, declare and make known that the powers granted under the Constitution being derived from the people of the United States may be resumed by them whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression, and that every power not granted thereby remains with them at their will . . .<br/><br/>New York and Rhode Island made almost identical statements as conditions of ratifying the Constitution.<br/><br/>The phrase ""united States"" is always in the plural in the Constitution, signifying not one consolidated government but that the independent and sovereign states were united in forming the federal government as their agent with only narrowly defined, delegated powers. BTW, the word ""perpetual,"" as used in those days, did not mean ""forever"" or ""cannot be broken."" Treaties between nations at the time often used the word ""perpetual"" to mean the agreement had no sunset provision, but the treaty could, in fact, be broken, and many were. The Confederates did not commit treason and any argument otherwise is historically absurd. They were the last defenders of the Constitution. The Union of the Founders died in 1865 when Lincoln conquered the South.<br/><br/>This movie is trash."
"TheMovieDiorama","5","0","1","1 February 2020"," National Treasure: Book of Secrets furthers its improbable mystery to conceal repetition.
","A sequel was destined after the predecessor's bountiful success. Never mind the discovery of an entire hall worth of jewelled artefacts founded by the Knights Templar and obscured by Freemasons. National Treasure was box office gold, the real valuable riches in this instance. Disney and Bruckheimer understood that more treasured possessions needed to be found. Audiences craved the treasure hunting adventures of old. ""How to fulfil that desire?"", you may ask. Well, just repeat the exact same narrative structure, only this time make it ""International Treasure"". Gates must follow a set of clues to find the legendary Cibola (lost city of gold) and prove that his great-great-grandfather was not a conspirator and architect of Lincoln's assassination.<br/><br/>This leads the gang to explore various locales, including Paris where apparently the most pleasant French police officers reside, London which sees Cage exercise his exaggerated British accent by shouting ""haggis"" (of all words...) in Buckingham Palace, ultimately leading to his arrest, and back to America to kidnap the President and sprinkle bottled water over Mount Rushmore. Phew! Treasure hunting sure is criminally exhausting. What Book of Secrets does improve from the first instalment, is the brisk flow of the mystery. Sure, National Treasure was incredibly fast paced for a family-friendly feature exceeding a two hour runtime, yet somehow this sequel is twice as fast whilst maintaining the urgency of the central plot. The unreasonably, and unlikely, escalated scenarios that Gates found himself enthralled in, resulted in a momentum that never dissipated. Turteltaub's flashy direction manages to entertain throughout, swiftly moving from set piece to set piece.<br/><br/>The fundamental issue with Book of Secrets is the ornate familiarity within its story. The screenplay, written by the Wibberley's, refused to explore other avenues. It's simple, effective, yet incredibly monotonous. The minimal amount of cryptic puzzles embedded throughout prevented any investigative strands from intertwining with the adventurous aesthetic. The writers instead forced more humour into each scenario, such as pretending to search for a lost earring in the Oval Office, rather than executing any methodology. Humour that didn't necessarily work. Cage performing one of his infamous ""cage rages"" in Buckingham Palace was legendary though. Hilarious! Would watch that scene on repeat every day.<br/><br/>The returning cast members were functional with some additional character development thrown in, particularly between Gates and his father. Mirren's addition as Gates' mother felt contrived, with a hammy performance to follow. The weakest character however was the antagonistic Wilkinson, equipped with an arc that was schizophrenic in nature. One scene you sympathise with him, the other want to throw him into a spiked booby trap. There was no common ground between him and Gates, making that final bittersweet confrontation emotionless. Although Harris always plays a tasty villain, and does so again here. Just not fully developed.<br/><br/>Book of Secrets is a sequel worth taking a peek at. Flicking through the pages at the same speed to which the feature plays. Rigid and efficient. Yet the familiar secrets that it conceals aren't worth uncovering."

","The first NATIONAL TREASURE was your usual clichÃ©d Hollywood adventure, a cheap-in-ideas but big-in-budget Dan Brown knock-off with little to remember it by. This sequel is even worse, saddled as it is with unbelievable situations, random character motivations, and one of the dullest plot lines ever (in which Nicolas Cage's character must prove the innocence of one of his historical ancestors).<br/><br/>In a film where the stakes are so low, everything seems artificial, from Diane Kruger's shoehorned-in love interest to Ed Harris's token bad guy. Jon Voight is a little better as Cage's dad, but the two of them are too obviously going for a Harrison Ford/Sean Connery relationship as in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, and it doesn't really gel. Still, Harvey Keitel is always a pleasure to see on screen, even though Helen Mirren gets right up my nose.<br/><br/>The film's globetrotting antics are where this film becomes particularly ridiculous, especially in its need to do cool and goofy things: let's break into Buckingham Palace (so easily), let's kidnap the President. As mentioned, it all feels very random and stupid, and Cage's overacting doesn't help; the scenes where he plays funny/crazy really are excruciating. I blame the Disney influence."

","Gates family history is Patrick Gates (Jon Voight)'s grandfather Charles' recollection of the night of Lincoln's assassination. Charles's father Thomas was given a book to decipher. It turned out to be Booth's diary and the man was actually a member of Knights of the Golden Circle. KGC were confederate saboteurs working in the north. The diary had a clue to a treasure that the confederates want. Thomas threw the pages into the fire and was killed for it. The confederate spy was able to retrieve a part of a page. Thomas Gates was always a hero in the story until now when Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) shows up with the missing page. Mitch is a antiquities soldier of fortune and wants the treasure. His ancestor was a confederate general. The missing page has Thomas Gates' name along with the other conspirators. Everybody now believes that Thomas was a Booth co-conspirator and Ben (Nicolas Cage) has to clear his family name with the help of Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), ex-girlfriend Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), and even his mother Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren) who can't stand his father.<br/><br/>The gang is reunited. The bickering couple chemistry is funny and good. The group has a lot of fun. The movie seems to be trying very hard to be cutesy fun. The addition of Helen Mirren added surprisingly little. Ed Harris is a little too scary and mean. He seems capable of killing anyone. They travel around the world in a wild chase for treasure. It's one big monument after another. It just turns very repetitive as they find clues in a series of over-the-top capers. About halfway into the movie, it gets way too ridiculous even for a National Treasure movie. I could still let this movie get a pass, but the final crazy City of Gold really sank this one. When they got on the ridiculous tippy top table, I couldn't wait for this to end."

","Treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates looks to discover the truth behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, by uncovering the mystery within the 18 pages missing from assassin John Wilkes Booth's diary.<br/><br/>Yes, I loved the first. I hear all these people complaining about all these little things that actually define movies in general. Sure, there was some tedious little thing put here and there, but I grew up and learned that things aren't perfect. And people may not realize this, but this a Disney film: made for KIDS. Doesn't necessarily mean we can't enjoy them either, but they aren't exactly trying to make you like it. The second installment of the series had some great expectations. Same cast from the original, an interesting plot, and seemed to have a lot more heist scenes (which I am a huge fan of!) So after sitting down and watching, I once again loved the film... Think of a bigger and badder National Treasure. That is what sequels are trying to be, right? The thing is, this movie blows the first out of the water. It has some spectacular set pieces, some amazing action scenes, and the heist scenes were really awesome (although some were over-the-top pointless.) The acting shouldn't even be commented on, this is a Disney movie by the way, and Nicholas Cage is in it. Thing is, if I imagined myself acting, I would do a much worse job then they have, so I give them kudos for at least trying. The plot is just like the first, they go from clue to clue to solving a puzzle. This is where the complainers come in, stating that the movie is ""over-the-top"" ""stupid"" ""unrealistic"". Well, yeah, and? I didn't know movies were supposed to be realistic. The Dark Knight surely wasn't realistic, but it has rave reviews? Movies are escapism that started that way, so stating something that you have no idea what your saying is just pointless. ANYWAYS... some of the ideas were stupid, yes, but I wasn't expecting an intellectual look at these things. It was a movie and I enjoyed it for what it is. All in all, I definitely recommend. People who complained, take this to heart and watch your 'over-the-top' realistic movies while the others can enjoy a great entertaining movie.

After his astonishing discovery of the riches of the Templar Knights, Ben has become the world's most famous treasure hunter... although he prefers the term ""treasure protector."" Ben and his father, university professor Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), are shaken by the discovery of one of the long-lost pages from the diary of Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth.

Much to Patrick's consternation, Ben calls upon a secret weapon -- his formidable mother and Patrick's ex-wife, linguistics professor Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren), who hasn't spoken to Patrick in 32 years.

Nicolas Cage seems slightly less enthusiastic about historical stuff and Diane Kruger, while still lovely, doesn't make you fall madly in love with her as in the first film. Harvey Keitel's return is welcome but he ultimately serves little purpose. And finally the treasure hunt and action scenes are considerably less thrilling this time around.<br/><br/>However, the movie still has plenty left for people who enjoyed the first movie.

As with the first film the sets are flimsy and solid wooden beams appear to have rotted over a couple of hundred years which would be highly unlikely especially if they were built around national treasures. The notion of secret societies and secret president business is very superficially explored and given a token academic mention. For experienced movie fans you will see a plagiarized scene from Gregory Pecks ""A Roman Holiday"" where he places his hand in a stone monument.As with that silly film the ""Da Vinci Code"" Ben Cage stumbles on the crack of each code just in time. One wonders how these treasures were hidden so secretly when it must of taken hundreds to move them.

While certainly the movie has its share of special effects, it also has both a fun plot, a brain, and even a message about human nature near the end. The story-telling could be more complex, as could the villain-turned-martyr, but for an action movie, I found that it left me feeling good about the two hours I'd used to experience it. While certain liberties had to be taken with regards to historical accuracy, the movie did well to subtly separate fact from fabrication, and the viewer is left knowing some incredibly interesting things that will leave you curious to learn more. As for what those things are, and what they are not, don't let a review ruin it for you. See it for yourself.

Kudos for the directors for keeping it that way.<br/><br/>There are some detractions - I thought the whole Rushmore part came off as a hodgepodge; it just felt very slapped together. Ed Harris's character was all over the map, not because of Harris but because of his wild and unexplained swings in role. This movie is hardly an in depth look at innermost character angst so why introduce the erratic ambiguity? Cage was fun but not outstanding.<br/><br/>Still, well worth the entertainment value if you are looking for some diversion and a few laughs. I gave it a 7."

","I loved the first movie and the second. The whole plot and premise have gotten young students interested in American history again. Well-done, interesting family movies are getting harder and harder to come by. I hope that if they make a third movie (as is rumored), that they will take it easy on the hair dye for Nick Cage. In the first movie, his hair color was noticeable, but not as distracting, more highlight than full on dye job. The REALLY BAD dark hair dye job in ""Book of Secrets"" was VERY distracting during the entire movie. Much like a piece of spinach in your date's teeth, once it attracts your attention you just can't get past it. I love Nick Cage, let's just have him like he is - mostly ;)"

","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>I wanted to hate this movie, I truly did. I put it on hoping to be subject to a big budget piece of crap that I could tear to shreds. Nick Cage is a guy that makes himself easy to hate: loud, obnoxious, hammy, bad hair plugs and a career thanks to nepotism. But on the flip side, he's been in some great films and was hard not to love in those roles: Vampire's Kiss, Rumblefish, Birdy, Wild at Heart and guilty pleasures Face Off and The Rock. Even recently he's done some respectable work: The Weatherman and Lord of War. But before I get completely off track, I just finished watching National Treasure: Book of Secrets ...and, reluctantly, I liked it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this isn't a great movie, but when you've got three academy award winners (Cage, Jon Voight, Helen Mirren) along with Harvey Keitel, Ed Harris and Bruce Greenberg, you can't help but at least consider it a great popcorn movie. OK, name recognition aside, Ed Harris is not worth mentioning here since he mails in a lazy performance where it seems the director (notorious hack John Turteltaub) kept forgetting to remind Harris he started the movie speaking with a faux southern drawl.<br/><br/>Overall, NT is a hybrid of Indiana Jones and The DaVinci Code, so much so you can imagine exactly how the pitch went down in some studio execs office. What makes this movie work are many of the same things that made Indy and DaVinci work: pseudo-historical facts, conspiracy theories, puzzles, riddles, suspenseful life or death consequences in secret chambers and a mother lode at the end of the exhaustive trail.<br/><br/>No this isn't high art. No this film is barely worth the effort I'm putting forth to write about it. This movie was fun: it invited me to participate in the puzzle solving, it revisited some interesting historical periods and it whet my appetite for some fascinating, clandestine conspiratorial details. At worst, this movie is a lazy parents excuse to educate kids with what would otherwise be found in boring history textbooks. What else would you expect from Disney?"
"Webs0116","7","0","1","12 May 2008"," Great Fun for What It's Worth
","Just as the first ""National Treasure"", if you are able to escape reality and simply enjoy the adventure for what its worth, then ""National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets"" should provide a family's worth of entertainment. There are a couple of parts of the film that fell like you are playing a pretty awesome action-packed video game in a world where the cops never catch you and the treasure holders of the past were able to rig traps of preposterous proportions. Having said that, however, the film does carry a strong plot surrounding both the search for the lost city of Cebola, ancient City of Gold, and in the process, attempt to clear the legacy of Bejamin Gates' (Nicolas Cage) great-grandfather and Patrick Gates' (Jon Voight) grandfather.<br/><br/>As a sub-plot, tensions are high between both Benjamin and Abigail (Diane Kruger) whose marriage has apparently come apart between the first film and this, and Patrick and Professor Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren), Benjamin's mother and Patrick's work-a-holic ex-wife. Justin Bartha delivers the best performance as Riley Poole, just as he did in the first. While the dialogue and development of all of the characters in the film is somewhat on par with the first, it was the character of Mitch Wilkenson (Ed Harris) that may keep you sour. It was as if the writers of this movie felt that there needed to be a quintessential 'bad guy' who was after Benjamin. Wilkenson is portrayed as an evil mastermind out to use Ben for his unique puzzle-breaking skills to eventually capture the same treasure sought after by Ben, sound familiar? Overall, the film does leave the viewer entertained, however, and that can be the only true determination as to the quality of an action-adventure film produced by Disney."

","OK. I love the first National Treasure movie. But to tell you the truth, I don't know whether I love the first or second more! And about page 47--that was most definitely a setup for a third movie!! There is nothing on this website about the start of a third movie (and IMDb is pretty good about getting the scoop on the new movies, such as they have the Harry Potter series and Chronicles of Narnia into 2010!) but you can definitely tell that there will be at some point. One can only patiently wait for another one just as good as the first two! Upon watching the first oh, about half hour of the movie, I started to not like Abigail. But she gains her support back as she shows Ben that she still loves him by helping him clear his family's name. I think Ben is a great character because he is always fair to everyone, and despite the fact that he really didn't like Wilkinson, he still credited him for part of the find. Aaaand...it all ended happily when not only Ben's parents got back together, as well as he and Abigail, but Riley found a girl who liked him, and actually wanted to meet him not Ben! Yay! Let me tell you, I will be the first in line to buy it when it comes to DVD!! :] peace out."

","National treasure 2 went exactly how I though it would. I walked in, sat down, witnessed a very similar plot to the first movie. To summarize it was a few friends, they came across a couple of road blocks, a couple of bad guys, but they got the treasure. The end. simple, elegant, genius. 9/10, I would give it ten, but it could have had a few more road blocks. Nicholas cage never had a torch like in the movie poster, only a flare, disappointing, 7/10. The best part of the movie was when Nick cage had a flare, and when there was a lot of water coming out of the things in the pyramid, and Nick's nemesis nearly died, but then they didn't die because they were enemies, to me this seems unrealistic, as if I were in the pyramid I would make them go down with me. 5/10. I really enjoyed Nick Cage. My favorite character was the comical guy who had the book and he had the book and no one came to his book signing because they never came because he is pathetic in real life. But he had a book. 1/10.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Class 3C, St. Snell Prep. School."

","Back in 2004 National Treasure was released; it wasn't bad, as it was something that hadn't been done that well for a while, since Indiana Jones. The sequel is more or so the same with a few tweaks but not many and this time it is even more absurd. Other than that they have kept the same plot line, mainly the same stars and the same outcome, so if want to save money you may as well rent the first one on DVD.<br/><br/>The basic story is about this treasure hunter called Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage  Ghost Rider, Leaving Las Vegas and Gone in Sixty Seconds) who is searching for a city of gold  I won't bore you with the details  which is connected to the assassination of President Lincoln in some way. This leads him to break into the Queen's private study in Buckingham Palace, sneak into the Oval Office, and later kidnap the President in search of clues. While being pursued by a rival treasure hunter (Ed Harris). I told you it was absurd.<br/><br/>There are good cast members, bad cast members and some that could of done better. Here are the rest of the cast, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight, Helen Mirren (who must have needed the money), Harvey Keitel and the in my opinion the very under used Justin Bartha who gives the film most of it laughs.<br/><br/>Overall the good points about the film is that it's fun, watchable, clever and quite witty at points, provided you don't think about it too much, or haven't seen the first film.. The bad points are that it's almost too absurd, to American for my liking (not that I don't like Americans I just prefer Britain), almost exactly the same as the first one and a few of cast could be better. Somehow this film topped the box office Stateside for three weeks, that's something that Gates himself wouldn't be able to solve."

","Though some doubted that the find-a-clue, figure-it-out and then find-the-treasure formula that made the first 'NT' film so fun could work again, I'm happy to say that it did succeed a second time. Maybe it won't a third time, as the end of this film fairly explicitly implied, but for a second go-around, sure.<br/><br/>All of the same actors and characters are back, with some welcome additions, including Helen Mirren as Ben Gates' (Nicholas Cage) mother. This time, the clue-finders are searching for a legendary City of Gold as made by the Native Americans to keep it from getting in the hands of Jeb Wilkinson, who simply wants to bring fame to his family's name like the heritage of Ben Gates can already claim.<br/><br/>There are even more clues in this 'National Treasure' than the first, some of which are discovered in a quick and unrealistic manner, but some features near the movie's end, particularly a giant balancing table underneath Mount Rushmore that requires both allies and villain to work together, is quite a treat that deserves commendation for Jerry Bruckheimer. 3/4 stars"
"noemail-132","7","0","2","18 February 2008"," Strengths appealing to popular culture
","There are several main points that I believe bring strength to this movie and give cause to its recognition in popular culture. The first would be that this film reaches out to a very broad audience demographically. Next is the idea that its themes, sub themes, and thematic elements are identifiable with the audience on one level or another. The last significant point that I can distinguish is the intrigue of mystery and relation to the very secrets that still prod history today. <br/><br/>Appealing to a vast audience is imperative to a film's success, by measurement of box-office performance and subsequent earnings. National Treasure 2 was rated PG for some aggression and violent action, which draws in a larger crowd than what a rated PG-13 or rated R movie would allow. Although it is not given for a completely general audience, it is viewable for anyone who can accept the fairly mild doses of action. The household name of Walt Disney greatly attracts audiences due to the trusted company and reputation that Disney has earned throughout the decades. By focusing in on a younger audience (with Disney distribution) alone, it lures parents and whole families to see the film. The movie was however marketed as a family affair, during holiday season which calls on the tradition of families getting together to go to the theaters (particularly on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day), which surely secured it rising to the top during the week it debuted (Wikipedia). By tending to families, an incredibly large range is covered that sweeps across gender, race, and certainly age. The statistics stating the millions of dollars grossed and status at number one for 17 days before dropping to the number two spot demonstrates this. The thematic elements in the plot also implore its success in popular culture. There are many sub themes that are identifiable for the different aspects of the audience. One of the general themes that it expresses is honor and dignity of the family name, which is an important American premise in our culture. Ben goes to great lengths to fully discover his family history and then in the sequel unwaveringly defends it, that he might beseech the truth he knows lies within. This is the type of message that resonates within culture and history and has great potential to register with viewers. For those in the audience too young or simplistic to capture this concept, there of course were the basic underlying messages which still echo as universal morality and goodness such as friendship and love. The relationships between Ben and Riley, Ben and Abigail, Patrick and his ex-wife Emily, and even in the end, between one of the protagonists and Ben, clearly remind us of that loyalty and reliability that we so value. The last point that I found which supports the movie's embrace from popular culture was the mystery. While this may sound like a simple marketing ploy to appease viewers with such suspense or only a genre, I believe that the way in which mystery is evoked from the movie is what really intrigues a great part of the audience. The reason this can be concluded is by the associations and parallelisms between the mystery and adventure in the storyline and that which still challenges historians, possible treasure hunters, anthropologists, archaeologists, societies, etc in this day and age. So often are people appealed by conspiracy, secrecy, and the significance of history. There was an abundance of these concepts being reflected. Among the list of famous historical sites were Mount Rushmore, The White House, The Library of Congress and Buckingham Palace. These are the types of places that most Americans can identify with as part of history or that history buffs are fascinated with, just as the main character was. Being relatable is an asset to popular culture."

","The first National Treasure set the bar for adventure films. The sequel is not as good but is very close. Both movies contain historical monuments as well as learning. Now this itself may confuse younger kids if your planing to bring them. This time around it focuses on the death of Abraham Lincoln.

Both Ben and his father are annoyed. For some reason Abigail Chase (played by Diane Kriger) has broken up with Ben(there is a reason but I won't spoil it). Riley Poole (played by Justin Bartha) has written a book about what happened in the first movie. In case you haven't seen it, Riley is still very funny as before. I don't wanna give away anymore of the movie but it's very good and awesome go see and this action movie is up there with The Goonies, Radiers of the Lost Ark and the original movie.

"simonparker1990","7","0","2","11 February 2008"," Naff as hell, but its so entertaining!
","The National Treasure are summed up in two words, guilty pleasure. On first look the two movies are nothing more than cheesy, over the top nonsense, The Da Vinci Code for morons if you will. However, when you actually sit and watch these films I can almost guarantee you'll smile, you'll be entertained, and most importantly you won't regret spending two hours watching the film. I really enjoyed the first movie, and so when a second movie was announced was looking forward to it. I left the first film smiling like a buffoon, today I did exactly the same thing. Sure I had lots of criticisms in my head, the plot for example does not entirely make sense, but the action and puzzle solving are just so ridiculously infectious you get caught up in the film. The performances are also quite lively and engrossing, Nicolas Cage is clearly enjoying himself once again and Dame Helen Mirren makes a welcome addition to the cast. Sure if you look deep enough you'll get irritated by the nonsensical plot, the ease that Gates manages to break into Buckingham Palace and the puzzles they have to solve. But if you are one of those people, a regular cinema goer in other words, who can just sit back, relax and prepare yourself to be entertained, then you will find much to enjoy in National Treasure: Book of Secrets.<br/><br/>Okay let me return to the performances then. Nicolas Cage is fast re-earning my respect. At one point I would quite happily see him give up acting, The Wicker Man remake just left me mortified. But thanks to Next, which like this is naff but fun, and now National Treasure 2, Cage seems to be on top form. Sure he's not going to win Oscars, and he is starting to look a bit past his best, but he has an infectious enthusiasm about him. Just watch the scene in Buckingham Palace where he gives the English accent a bad name, its a cheesy scene, but its fun because of Cage. He also has great chemistry with the majority of the cast as well. Diane Kruger unfortunately lets the side down a bit, she's a lot better than she was in the original movie, but she is still a very bland actress and I don't think the movie really suits her anyway. Justin Bartha as Riley doesn't feel as fun this time around, but he does have some amusing lines, and thankfully that awful ""death and despair"" line from the trailer was cut. Jon Voight makes a return appearance and he has more to do this time around, sure he looks old nowadays, but he does a decent job. Helen Mirren is a nice addition to the cast, her accent is a bit bizarre, but she has some fun scenes with Voight and its nice to see her get stuck into the action near the end. Unfortunately Ed Harris is a bit wasted as the main villain, he has little to do apart from sneer and seem nasty, he has a good bit near the end, but apart from that there might as well not be a villain.<br/><br/>National Treasure, like Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones before, is a nice blend of humour and action. The movie succeeds greatly in gently entertaining the viewer. Of course National Treasure isn't the new Indiana Jones, but it is a very entertaining film. The action sequences are executed in typical Bruckheimer manner, the chase through London is particularly thrilling, and the final half hour is superb, you'll sit on the edge of your seat throughout it. The humour also works quite well, although some of Riley's lines are extremely hit and miss. alas where National Treasure falls apart is the storyline. The Book of Secrets mentioned in the title is seemingly irrelevant, it shows up once and doesn't really have a major impact on the storyline. Instead the majority of the film is a series of small puzzles leading to the next one, how this actually proves that the great grandfather of Gates didn't plan the murder of Lincoln is beyond me. The movie just seems incredible stupid, if you can ignore this fact then it doesn't really matter, I ignored it for the majority of the film, but there were the occasional times I thought the movie had gone a bit too far.<br/><br/>Overall National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a great sequel to the original movie, whether or not it is better than the original is still debatable, I'll have to watch it again to make my mind up. If you go looking for the next Indiana Jones then prepare to be disappointed, wait for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull instead, if you want a dumb film where you can switch off and still be entertained then go see National Treasure 2, there are much worse films around."

","Always starting with the bad news... It is well within the shadow of its predecessor, and it doesn't have the thrill and magic the first movie displayed. Ben Gates's father seems to be played like a bumbling old man, which is confusing when he was previously played as a strong, proud character in the first movie. And what was it with the British accents, why were they sounding like they were just off the set of Oliver Twist! Very few of us Brits talk like that.<br/><br/>The good news is... A sufficient amount of interesting conspiracy theories, puzzles and treasure make the mouth water, but it does get a little dry during the over played car chasing and action scenes.

","1st watched 1/20/2008 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Jon Turtletaub): Despite lunacy of plot, entertaining movie. In the follow-up to the 1st 'National Treasure"" where Nicholas Cage and the gang try to uncover hidden secrets in U.S. landmarks looking for a treasure hidden from the British soldiers during the civil war --- a twist is thrown in right from the beginning where the Gates family of treasure-hunters names could be darkened forever by a rumor that an ancestor was part in the assassination of Lincoln. This put Cage and company back on the trail of the treasure to prove that it's real and there is no truth to the rumor. Of course, there is an antagonist other treasure hunter, played by Ed Harris, portraying an ancestor of John Wilkes Boothe who wants his rumor kept in place to free up his family's evil past. This begins the ever increasingly complicated series of clues leading eventually to a literal goldmine(hint, hint). Of course, Mr. Gates has the same companions as the first movie with added ones, like his Mom, played by the Queen portrayer, Helen Mirren, who can read ancient lost Indian symbols and is sought after once an artifact is found leading to more answers. The bottom line is this movie is overblown, idiotic, non-sensical Hollywood-fare but has a sense of humor and a pace that gets increasingly harder to turn from and makes it a watchable and entertaining movie. One of the highest forms of escapist entertainment because of it's absurdity but if that's what you're looking for it's perfect. There are also some wonderful sets and puzzles that have to be solved as the movie goes on that reveals a very well-thought out and executed thriller to enchant and entertain the masses. Which this definitely does despite it's silliness."

","I thought the movie had a brilliant plot and you definitely don't need to see the first National Treasure movie in order to understand the concepts of this continuation. I hadn't seen the first movie and it was easy to understand what was going on as their were minimum references to the first movie. The actors portrayals of their characters were great, and overall the movie is worth seeing at the cinemas as you wouldn't get the same screen quality renting it out on DVD. It would be interesting to know if some of the facts in the movie can be generalised to real life, such as whether there really is a book that presidents use, whether the city of gold exists, and whether this tale has non-fiction aspects."

"Hancock_the_Superb","6","0","4","27 January 2008"," More of the same, and I mean that in a kinda good way
","Picking up where we left off from the first ""National Treasure"", Benjamin Gates (Nicholas Cage) and his father Patrick (Jon Voight) are riding high off their successful treasure-finding in the first film. But things change rapidly when girlfriend Abigail (Diane Kruger) leaves him, Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) tries to cash in for himself, and more importantly, an archaeologist named Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) comes forward with evidence implicating Ben's family in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. As in the first film, Ben enlists the help of his buddies - this time adding his estranged mother (Helen Mirren) - to engage in an improbable globe-trotting expedition to clear his family name, with Mitch and his henchmen in hot pursuit.<br/><br/>""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is virtually identical to the 2004 original. The same plot, same improbable conspiracy theories, most of the same characters, lots of Goldbergian traps, locks, and devices, and a ridiculous storyline that defeats any attempt to think it through, and if you're the right sort of person, allows you to sit back with a wide grin of incredulity as the madness unspools.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe the appeal of these films. The cast is made up of reasonably talented actors with very slight and ridiculous material. The story makes no sense, and the action scenes are a curious combination of weak (no one actually gets killed except by ""accident"") and enjoyable. The Masonic conspiracy theories are too far-fetched for even Jim Marrs or Chris Carter to accept (Mount Rushmore was constructed to hide the Seven Cities of Gold? Come on now!). The very idea of someone infiltrating Buckingham Palace or the White House - or kidnapping the President (Bruce Greenwood), however briefly - is just ridiculous. But as resident funny-man Riley so clearly points out: ""We make our living off crazy"".<br/><br/>In the acting department, Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha, and Jon Voight pretty much give the same performances as they do last time. They're pleasant enough, if not particularly compelling characters to watch, which is all the material requires of them. In the Sean Bean role, Ed Harris chews scenery and spouts a reasonably convincing Southern accent, although his character changes from evil to sympathetic . Fresh from her Oscar win, Helen Mirren tosses off an amusing performance as Ben's mom. Bruce Greenwood contributes a warm grin or two to the proceedings and then bows out. Harvey Keitel's large-ish role in the original as the bemused FBI Agent pursuing Ben and Co. is reduced to a cameo.<br/><br/>So, what can I say? If you liked the first one, you'll like this. They're virtually the same film, and I mean that in a good way - kinda.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The first National Treasure movie about hidden Templar treasure and clues dating back to founding of the United States was although far-fetched, a very interesting movie. In the second adventure, Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha reprise their roles to solve a maze of ciphers and monuments dating back to the American Civil war.<br/><br/>Just at the end of the Civil War, John Wilkes Booth hands a cipher to Ben Gates’ great grandfather just as he heads out to shoot President Lincoln. As he deciphers, Gates learns that the cipher leads to an ancient treasure which the confederate better not lay their hands on and destroys those 18 pages.<br/><br/>Cut to present, Ben Gates is talking about Civil War heroes when a black marketer Wilkinson (Ed Harris), quite an effective villain, produces a partly burnt page from the Booth Diary with the old Gates’ name on it as one of the architects of the assassination. Ben Gates gets into a treasure hunt and attempts to clear off his ancestor’s name.<br/><br/>To assist Benjamin Gates are his trusted team Justin Bartha as Riley Poole and Diane Kruger as his estranged girlfriend Abagail Chase. This time the adventure takes you through Paris, Buckingham Palace, The Oval Office, yeah one at the White House and Kidnapping of the President, Library of Congress and Mount Rushmore! Whew! The movie casts three Academy Award Winners Cage and Jon Voight & Helen Mirren as Cage’s parents. While Jon Voight has got a larger role this time, Helen Mirren seemed too old for her role. The lead characters simply repeat their roles. When you see them solving clues one after another, it doesn’t surprise as you’ve seen it all before.<br/><br/>For those who head to the movie hall with expectations just as much as its predecessor, you will come out happy. If you prefer using too much of logic, you would laugh at the idea of a city of gold under a hill. All said and done, I have all admiration for American movie makers to turn out fashionable adventures with a nationalist feel."

","I would see this movie again in a heartbeat! I loved the first one and the sequel did not disappoint. It was fast paced, no slow moments, and I love history too so that was an added plus. One of my favorite movies growing up was the Goonies where the kids all go in search of treasure. They have to go down in underground passages and solve riddles to diffuse booby traps. ""Indiana Jones"" had this special adventure/were-off-to-find something-important feel to it too as did ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (though nowhere near to the same extent with ""Pirates""). There were some moments when you go ""how the heck can he figure this out so fast?"" but, hey, I just figure Nic's character is a genius and I couldn't begin to understand geniuses anyway.<br/><br/>Once again we have a bad guy that you love to hate who does a very good job. And the Ferrari is back so that rocks! The scenes where they are inside Mt. Rushmore are just totally awesome. It reminded me of when I went to Universal Studio's Island's of Adventure on the island called Lost Continent. The ""ride"" was called Poseidon's Fury and you basically walk through this huge building that's supposed to be underground, like in this part of the movie, and you end up walking through a swirling vortex of water and watch Poseidon battle it out with his arch nemesis. Really cool! Highly recommend this movie!!!"

But we were all blown away by the enhanced comedy and the new characters like Ben's mother (Helen Mirren) and Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris). The relationship between Ben's parents was hilarious and realistic despite their unrealistic surroundings. The scene when Ben pretends to be drunk in Buckingham Palace, though, was the absolute BEST!!!! And Riley is there as always with his infamous humor and sarcasm with every move he makes. I give Book of Secrets a 9/10 because the who was going to die at the end was quite predictable - but really, who else was there besides Mitch?"
"classicalsteve","6","0","1","5 January 2008"," Entertaining But Essentially the Same as the Original -- Lots of Artifacts, Clues and Car Chases
","The treasure hunters are at it again, except this time the reason for accessing an ancient lost treasure of gold is not for it's monetary value, which seems downright Un-American. It is to exonerate a recent injustice in which an ancestor of Nicholas Cage is wrongfully determined to have been involved with the assassination of President Lincoln in 1865. So now Cage has to get a treasure to clear his family! Even though this treasure is probably worth 100 Billion dollars, that's not the point!<br/><br/>Overall, it is almost exactly the same idea as the first movie, except it's a different treasure with different clues and different artifacts, but rings a little bit like deja-vu all over again. Despite some of the absolutely preposterous tasks, such as breaking into Buckingham Palace in London and later the Oval Office in Washington DC, not to mention kidnapping the President of the United States(!), it still has its entertainment value, sort of a cross between Indiana Jones, the Da Vinci Code and the Hardy Boys.<br/><br/>This movie has all the elements of the original. The discovery of secret documents and artifacts. Deciphering codes from monuments and arcane objects, some from various parts of the world. Sneaking into the highest-security areas of the Western World. And between all these episodes are the usual car chases and other catastrophes that continually threaten our merry band of heroes from obtaining their treasure. And of course there is the adversarial band of baddies after the same treasure, this time headed by Ed Harris. It's all here.<br/><br/>Because the car chases and catastrophes are repeated so similarly to the first movie, I wonder if they were really needed. I would have liked to hear more about the artifacts themselves, their origins, and their significance. I think I would have found the story more compelling if this modern-day Indiana Jones shtick could have done more with the history and mystery and less with the car chases. Still acceptably entertaining and at least you won't feel like you want your two hours back, let alone your ten bucks. But don't expect any twists or turns that didn't already occur in the first movie. And the intellectual aspects are kept to a minimum so as not to offend any of the adolescent movie-going public."
"madmax007","8","0","1","4 January 2008"," A Film That Repeats The Same Formula As The Original
","2004's National Treasure was a massive sleeper Hit bringing Nicholas Cage to both critical and commercial success with audiences who loved his historically correct intellectual adventurous persona. The film became one of the years highest grossing films and is just what Cage needed. For years after the eighties he'd been trying to shake off his celebrity teen star image with films like Valley Girl and When Peggy Sue Got Married which brought him fame in the eighties aside from being Francis Ford Coppola nephew. Leaving Las Vegas showed that he had the potential as an adult star but National Treasure made people forget about his years as a naive teen star and put him in all aspects as a sophisticated adult star. Because National Treasure was such a success it was no surprise that there was going to be a sequel nor was it a surprise that the sequel was going to pale in comparison to the original, because if you've been around the block more than once then you know that most sequels don't work out like the originals and Book of Secrets fails in just that same way.<br/><br/>The film repeats the same formula as the original crew follows a branch of clues that that requires one to be a competent historian and includes puzzles which require some mathematical and scientific thought. The film is set up the same and you know like all adventures films there will be a conclusive climax that brings the story and clues together in one final scene that details the treasure rewards the protagonist as desired. Nicholas Cage's character Ben Gates has a specific desire to find the treasure that puts him at risk for many unfortunate consequences. The film itself revolves around the Lincoln assassination conspiracy and how it has recently surfaced that Gate's great great grandfather Thomas Gates could be the mastermind of the whole conspiracy kill Lincoln. To clear his families name and not fill the shoes of new Dr.Samuel Mudd (who helped John Wilkes Booth) Gates goes through all the trouble of going on another treasure hunt to clear his grandfather's name and that's what the whole film revolves around. In any case, many people wouldn't mind having a notorious figure in their family and wouldn't go through any where near as much trouble Gates gets into.<br/><br/>Though Ben Gates being the historical nut that he is goes through a lot of trouble in order to clear Thomas Gates name, having a plot line focusing around this sole purpose is inane. The main plot points circle around a range of conspiracy theories which play a vital part in this and most other recent adventure films. This one includes a Book of Secrets which has been passed down from president to president revealing truths of presidential assassinations, Watergate. Area 51 and finally the one this film revolves around: the Indian built City of Gold. Finding the City of Gold is the only chance Gates has of clearing his great great grandfathers name. <br/><br/>Recurring characters include Gates former girlfriend from the first film Abigail (Diane Kruger) who for reasons vaguely explained in this film have broken up. Also, Gates sometimes incompetent partner Riley Pool(Justin Bartha) who in the film has just wrote a book on conspiracies and urban legends which plays a vital part in solving some of the clues and puzzles however the book is ignored by most people. Other characters include Gate's divorced parents who are still heated at one another over their failed relationship. Gates Mother plays a vital part in reading PreColumbian Indian language which also plays a part in finding the location of the City Of Gold. The supposed antagonist Mitch Wilkinson who during the climax actually helps out the characters which is rarely seen in an antagonist it is a strange twist brought upon by the producers. All these clashing personalities tie into the film appropriately considering the subject matter because all of the crews characters provide much historical knowledge and create a sense of drama that movie goers will enjoy seeing. Two other vital players in the film include a rough caricature of some future president because the producers knew what kind of controversy they would cause if they parodied George.W.Bush. The second supporting player is the FBI leader Sadusky (Harvey Keitel). <br/><br/>The film lacks much originality relying on what much of the first film had in store for audiences and continuing with the same idea. I found it repetitive and unoriginal as this film shows in a variety of ways how the same intense drama/action scenes play out like any other overaction movie would. In some ways, the way the scenes played out reminds me of a ""24"" action montage. However this film is like any other action/adventure/drama film a sense of purpose and clashing emotions create a plot line to follow and a not to surprising climax. Regardless of that the film is a must see for families or people who really liked the first film."

","This would normally be a popcorn-summer-type movie and it would make good money in normal summers... remember that the fourth installment of Indiana Jones will be out next summer and it would bury this cotton candy movie making if it went head to head. I don't blame the producers releasing it now at all! <br/><br/>This is a very decent part two in the series where Nick Cage so desperately needs another movie hit. You can tell that every actor in the movie was having a blast on their new 'treasure' hunt. I'll not spoil any part of the movie for those who are considering going (I'm sure other's have in their critiques), but I will say they did have a huge hint that there will be third National Treasure that will need to be found! <br/><br/>You'll enjoy this movie and it's over the top plot line and cardboard bad guy (played by the awesome Ed Harris), but don't expect Shakespeare... just buy the popcorn on the way in and don't be late because you'll not want to miss a new Disney cartoon at the beginning to warm you up!"
"InLikeFlynn91","10","0","6","29 December 2007"," If you liked the first, then you will like the second
","A lot of people gave this film horrible reviews and negative comments. The problem is that they didn't like the first one. <br/><br/>National Treasure two is faster paced, has more locations, more plot twists, bigger cast, and better one liners. This film isn't going to win any Oscars but it will keep you smiling until the end. =) Some of the scenes honestly kept me on the edge of my seat. Even the history in the film was great. I honestly learned some very interesting facts. <br/><br/>SLIGHT SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!! (BEWARE) The Book of Secrets is the book that has all the answers. It contains information about all of the United State's greatest mysteries, like the Kennedy assassinations, and area 51! Obviously Nicholas Cage needs it. Finding the book and then using the book's information is basically the film in a nut shell, (although that hardly gives it justice) In the mean time while this is going on you have Ed Harris tracking them down and basically playing the Ian of the first film. You also have the sub plot of Cage's divourced parents. They are hysterical in their insults towards each other and are basically comic relief. <br/><br/>The acting was also great. Nicholas Cage looks a little older but is still the Ben Gates we love. Justin Bartha is by far much better in this film, with snappier lines and delivery. His character even develops! (Gasp) Diana Kruger is basically used a sex object in the film. John Voight is also better in this film and is in it much more. Helen Mirren's character was a bit cheesy but she played her brilliantly. Ed Harris did a lovely job as the villain. Sadly Harvey Keitel was not needed. He was great once again and i believe he should have been more involved. The surprise of the movie Bruce Greenwood playing the president. He was superb.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT) *DANGER PERIL* By far the best scene is John Voight swingin' on the vine with Helen Mirren! (he he he) Riley's best line was ""Wait, there's more than one statue of liberty?""<br/><br/>All in all this film was every bit more far fetched than the first one but I think that's why I love it even more. I loved and i would highly recommend you watching it!"

"themovieace","10","0","5","23 December 2007"," unbelievably great!
","this shouldn't have spoilers...or it doesn't from my perspective! :) I have been waiting for this movie for almost a year...since i went to DC with my 8th grade class...and we were standing across the street watching Nick Cage and Justin Bartha running lines...it was one of the single most amazing movies of the year! i thought it was absolutely fantastic! it has an incredible story that fits with the old one. And one thing that i thought was fun, was that it gave Riley more of a story this time. He was a bigger part of this movie, than he was the last one. The ending really surprised me, and the relationship between Helen Miran and Jon Voight is hilarious! This one 9more so than the other) has a very Indiana Jones feel about it. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie, and am already planning on going to see it again! I cant wait till it comes out on DVD and i want to see all the bonus features and deleted scenes! SideNote: look for the part in front of the yellow church...thats where we saw them filming! and when they r on the stairs in front of the capital...we were there getting our picture taken only a day or so earlier!"
"NavyOrion","5","0","1","21 December 2007"," Fair sequel, weaker than the first
","Having just seen this on its opening night, I think I can fairly predict it will be huge. That being said, though, this is a much weaker film than the first one.<br/><br/>There's no need for a spoiler warning here: if you've seen the previews, you've already seen pretty much the whole movie; what few surprises there might have been were ruined. <br/><br/>Secondly, the characters are a good bit blander this time out. Nicolas Cage's Ben Gates (in the worst haircut since Pete Rose) seems to come up with the answers to the puzzles just a little too easily to draw any drama from the revelations. Diane Kruger is back as Abigail Chase, but romantic troubles between her and Gates, introduced for no real reason, are as easily forgotten later. Ed Harris, although a fine actor, has a plain-vanilla role here as the bad guy whose motivations seem as unclear to himself as to the audience. Jon Voight reprises and enlarges his role as the father, and is joined (for no particular reason) by Helen Mirren as the mother, but neither really seems necessary to the movie. Harvey Keitel's role as FBI agent Sadusky might have been nicely enlarged into a second threat to Gates, but is instead reduced to almost nothing. And Justin Bartha is back (and great) as sidekick Riley, but the subplot of his IRS problems (and a running joke of his being mistaken for Gates) just don't work.<br/><br/>As for the suspension of disbelief, a little too much is asked, as brilliant insights come too quickly, gigantic stones are way too light, and the Secret Service (not to mention the Queen's palace guards) just a bit too easy to fool. If a movie is going to ask you to overlook a lot, there has to be a bigger payoff.<br/><br/>Several reviews have pointed out the similarity of this series to the Indiana Jones films; let's hope that like those, the third National Treasure movie (strongly hinted at the end) will make a strong comeback after this so-so sequel. <br/><br/>-----------------------<br/><br/>P.S. - Kudos to the nameless Disney executive who decided to bring back the idea of the pre-movie cartoon (and Goofy is always a great choice), but with 40 years to think about it, this short was the best you could come up with?"
"marvinpeterlerocha","10","0","3","21 December 2007"," Great Time! Lots of Laughs!
","If you like movies about treasure, action, and adventure, and you liked the first installment, you'll LOVE this one. I had some great laughs, some moments of fear, and butterflies throughout the entire movie. The cast was wonderful, Nick Cage did a great job along with all the others.<br/><br/>It's great for the entire family, except for the little ones that are maybe younger than 4 because of the action. There aren't any love scenes that you'd have to worry about too much. There's maybe 2 or 3 kissing scenes that wouldn't hurt anyone. <br/><br/>Now, if you're a person that goes to a movie and says, ""This could NEVER happen,"" then I suggest you DON'T watch this movie. If you do, you'll spend most of the time saying it can never happen and miss the whole story. So just go with the movie and you'll have a great time. <br/><br/>***CAUTION***SPOILER AHEAD*******<br/><br/>Now, if you don't like movies that end in the middle (like the Golden Compass) and just shouts out there'll be a third one, then Don't WORRY. This movie leaves an open door to a third one, but it doesn't stop right in the middle, it's just something that leaves you wanting more. Here's the scene, the President asks Ben Gates what is in the 47th page of the Secret Book and just leaves you to wonder. But that's not where the movie ends, there's still about 3 mins. after that to close the movie. But not something you should worry about, it doesn't ruin the movie. There might not even be a third installment. If there is though, I'll be glad to see it."
"babylovee_x","8","0","2","26 December 2007"," Worth It.
","I honestly don't write these things but I thought I had to write one since a lot of people are saying this movie didn't ""live up"" to the first one or it wasn't as fun or WHATEVER. Personally, I liked this movie. I thought it was entertaining, it was worth my 10 bucks and it was well-made. It was pretty similar to the 1st one but you got to give the producers a hand. Not anybody can make up ideas like the ""President's Book of Secrets"" and the clues were interestingly - especially in the first one. I got to say that I did like the 1st one a lot better but NT2 was enjoyable. This movie does teach you a lot about history. And not in the boring way, either. They just state a historical fact and you sort of remember it after, from there on. Plus, I simply love Nic Cage! I think he's a great actor and he made this movie work, as well as the other characters. Jon Voight was a good choice for the father and I'm glad they kept most of the characters from NT1. So, if your planning on watching this movie, I assure you, it'll be worth it. There might be a few flaws here and there but you watch a movie to get entertained, don't you? Nd this certainly was an entertaining movie."
"atomicgarden50","7","0","2","26 December 2007"," so bad its good
","So bad its good. Horrible acting but it will make you laugh. The sarcasm is through the roof. Justin Bartha has the worst acting of all both him and Cage over act so much. The one liners are all over the place that will make you giggle but, there is no way on earth any one can take this movie seariously. The scene when Cage is talking to the president about the Book of Secrets was the climax of the sarcastic acting. Diane Kruger's character was off the charts with her over acting. There Were some cool scenes that took place in the 1860's. I do not recall the first film being this over acted. I do not under stand how Cage can stand there and talk to Ed Harris after he and his men shot at him. In a strange way I did some what enjoy it."
"annoman","7","0","1","26 December 2007"," Though often implausible, 'Book of Secrets' is a gloriously exciting show
","Though often implausible, Turteltaub's sequel to his 2004 box office smash is a gloriously amusing show, lush wish creativity and heaps of excitement. It rings many of the same bells that National Treasure did, which it seems to be okay with, yet the hunt it proceeds to take its viewer's on is a much grander one, which, essentially, makes it feel more important.<br/><br/>Ben Gates' great-great grandfather is implicated as a conspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln following the turn-up of Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris), a descendant of an under-appreciated historical figure, who makes the claim and supports it with a missing page to John Wilkes Booth's diary. Ben and his National Treasure companions (Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha and Jon Voight) collaborate with Ben's mother, a University professor (played by 2006 Oscar-winner Helen Mirren), to prove the innocence of Thomas Gates, and, in the meantime, unearth Cibola, the legendary City of Gold.<br/><br/>Book of Secrets surpasses its predecessor with more thrills and even more high-caliber Hollywood names, and is, at times, blissfully reminiscent of Spielberg's classic (and far superior) Indiana Jones series. It's perhaps the most thrilling Disney release since The Curse of the Black Pearl, and it's certainly a wonderful experience that can be shared with people of all ages, and family, too."
"Robert_duder","9","0","5","25 December 2007"," National Treasure still holds itself together despite some minor flaws
","How good is National Treasure: Book of Secrets? Well I'm hailing it with exact same score I gave the original one three years ago and I have A LOT of good things to say about it. The biggest problem with the film is the complexity of the puzzles and story leave some major plot holes including the biggest one of all that holds the entire story together...how does finding a lost city of gold vindicate Ben Gates' ancestor? It just doesn't make sense. But even that is easily overlooked for a romping adventure with a terrific cast, some additions to the cast, and the second half is truly an adventure to behold. The best part is that National Treasure: Book of Secrets holds to the original formula by creating a whole new genre of action, treasure hunting by keeping things in North America with witty and smart puzzles and a treasure and history...all based on real events and places. This installments takes you from France, to the Queen's office in Buckingham to the Oval Office to Mount Rushmore without even taking a breath. With the original film (see my review) I really harped on the name of the film but I must have grown accustomed to it because I don't think National Treasure is such a bad name for the series...it's even fitting.<br/><br/>I have said so many times before that I do not care for Nicholas Cage but how do I keep saying that and then love most of his films (Ghost Rider aside--see my review.) Plus I love Ben Gates. Cage plays the swashbuckling hero treasure hunter flawlessly and I think captures even more personality in this second installment. He is even more likable, more wild and unhinged, and more fun than even the first one. Cage has a very bankable character with Gates. Justin Bartha returns as hilarious sidekick Riley Poole, and they definitely use him more in this one for comic relief which can be a risk throwing that much comedy into the role but he does alright. I think they should give him more of an action based role next time around, put him in the thick of things but he has some more neat gadgets and pulls the role off well and him and Cage have good hero/sidekick chemistry. Diane Kruger also returns as Cage's love interest (now broken up) Abigail Chase. She is lovely and sexy and the perfect addition to the cast again. She's smart and strong and looks confident as the female lead and a great match for Cage who has been paired up with some odd females in the past. The terrific Jon Voight also returns as Cage's father Patrick Gates. He plays a bigger role this time around which is terrific because he was so good in the original. His character is soft spoken, a little clumsy and shy and he does a terrific job bringing that character back. Newcomers to the cast are welcome!! Helen Mirren (who I admit I have not always been a fan of and I think she's over rated) does a really terrific job as Cage's mother and Voight's long time divorced wife. Voight and Mirren have great chemistry together and make great treasure hunters and their volatile and feisty relationship mirrors that of Cage and Kruger's relationship. Now a stumbling block...in the original film Sean Bean was a terrific villain, no holds barred, clearly evil and a terrific nemesis. A great predecessor would be Ed Harris, who is amazing all the time. He plays fame hunter Mitch Wilkinson who wants nothing more than Gates to lead him to a treasure so he can be famous. The problem is Harris plays both sides...sometimes he's evil and other times he's not such a bad guy and even comes across as a hero in the end. So the film is lacking something a clear good vs evil line. There is no real main villain. Harris's character is kind of wishy washy and not really strong in either aspect and that's a shame and a waste of his great talent. Harvey Keitel also returns in a very small cameo as the FBI agent who hunted Gates down originally and he's doing the same in a smaller capacity. Bruce Greenwood also makes for a terrific President of The United States which he has done before in other films.<br/><br/>The concept of treasure hunting in our own back yard is terrific and exciting and there is no shortage of underground caverns and terrific puzzles and right off the bat you're treated to a re-creation of the Lincoln assassination which is really something to get your blood pumping for the rest of the film. No matter what...either National Treasure film and more so with this one now there must be a suspension of belief. You have to let go of the fact that there is NO way a single person could sneak in and out of Buckingham Palace, The Oval Office, The Library of Congress and kidnapping the President...yes all the happens. But somehow the cast makes you believe it possible and this wonderful fantasy, slapstick, adventure comes alive. Don't hold back...this one is great for kids and adults and watch the first one and then go see the second, just don't take it too seriously and you'll have a great time!! 9/10"
"brainyidiot","7","0","2","25 December 2007"," Suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets is the kind of high adventure movie that succeeds in keeping you on the edge of your seat while Nick Cage and company follow a sort of secular New World Da Vinci Code by following one clue after another up until the exciting climax. Seems like Cage's family is linked to the Lincoln assassination so he sets out to prove it untrue. His nemesis played by the always reliable Ed Harris is ominously following him for reasons of his own. The lovely Diane Kruger is back but this time they're estranged-but as in all formula flicks we already can figure out the outcome of that plot twist. It's a plus that Helen Mirren is along as John Voight's long ago ex and Cage's mother and it turns out she has a talent of her own as an expert on ancient carvings that proves useful in Cage's quest. Unfortunately, Harvet Keitel only has a few scenes as does Bruce Greenwood as the President. But it all amounts to a good popcorn movie the whole family can enjoy. Oh yeah, Ty Burrell makes a likable sidekick computer geek with tricks of his own. Is it far fetched? Sure, but it works as entertainment."
"rainman720","8","0","4","25 December 2007"," Pretty good sequel
","As sequels go, this one was better than most. The action was as good as the original, and Ed Harris is a really good bad guy. The scenery from around the world and the country was incredible.<br/><br/>It's full of good one-liners, and once again Riley gets some of the best.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is pretty good, the idea that Ben Gates would take up the hunt to clear his great-great-grandfather's name as a conspirator (maybe even the mastermind) of President Lincoln's assassination.<br/><br/>But I can't give this movie a 9 or 10, simply because that's the one loose end they don't tie up. Neither my wife nor I have any idea what it was about finding the city of gold that prompted the headline that clears Thomas Gates.<br/><br/>If there is a third (and I'm guessing that whatever it is on page 47 will lead us down that road), I hope the writers and director(s) fill in all the gaps."

And definitely left an opening for another sequel.<br/><br/>Never did resolve the accusation and truth behind it all. Wimped out on the rationale behind the hunt for the Treasure.<br/><br/>Raise it back to PG13 at least and look at Indiana Jones as a model for what could be done."
